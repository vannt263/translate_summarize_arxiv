    "massive stars impact many areas of astrophysics , yet there is still no consensus on how they form .",
    "one possible scenario is that they form in a similar way to low - mass stars , i.e. through accretion from gravitationally bound cores ( core accretion ) . in the turbulent core model ( @xcite , hereafter mt02 , mt03 ) ,",
    "the massive cores that will form massive stars are supported by internal pressure provided by a combination of turbulence and magnetic fields .",
    "the pressure at the core surface is assumed to be approximately the same as that of the surrounding larger - scale self - gravitating star - cluster - forming clump , with a typical mean mass surface density of @xmath10 .",
    "such dense and highly pressurized cores can reach high accretion rates during their collapse , which may be needed to form massive stars . depending on how , including how quickly , the initial massive starless core is assembled and how much additional material is accreted during collapse , such a scenario may involve relatively ordered , monolithic accretion via a central disk and the driving of collimated bipolar outflows .",
    "other possible mechanisms include competitive accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and stellar collisions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which involve much less ordered and chaotic accretion processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a recent review ) .    if core accretion is how massive stars form , the evolution of massive protostellar objects should be dependent on the initial conditions of the cores .",
    "the turbulent core model explicitly relates the structure and the evolution of a core to two initial conditions : the initial mass of the core @xmath0 and the mean mass surface density of the surrounding clump @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the disk size is expected to be dependent on the degree of rotation in the initial core , which can be described by the parameter @xmath2 , the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy of a core .",
    "it is difficult to observationally identify the evolutionary stages of massive protostars due to the fact that they form in very crowded , highly obscured , and distant environments .",
    "therefore , in order to more accurately estimate the properties of massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) and constrain the theories of massive star formation , radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations are needed to predict the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and images to compare with multiwavelength observations of massive ysos .",
    "a number of rt models have been developed to compare with the observations .",
    "@xcite developed a large model grid to fit yso seds .",
    "in particular , they found that the spectral index or color calculated with fluxes at @xmath11 m is valuable for deriving the evolutionary stages of ysos .",
    "however their model grid was mainly developed for low - mass star formation , without coverage of the parameter space needed for massive star formation , such as very high accretion rates or massive compact cores expected in high surface density environments . also , the components in the model are relatively simple ( e.g. , the density in the outflow is usually assumed to be either a constant value or a power law ) and not self - consistently included based on the evolutionary sequences . furthermore , gas opacities , relevant for the region inside the dust destruction front , where most accretion power is liberated , were not included . a similar rt model grid has also been developed by @xcite , focused on mysos .",
    "their results from fitting the observations with this model grid suggested there are two groups of sources occupying different regions in the color - color diagram at 24 @xmath12 m and longer wavelengths and the mass - luminosity diagram , which may represent two evolutionary stages of massive star formation .",
    "however , the components in their model are also relatively simple and there is no self - consistent protostellar evolution included .    here",
    "we present the third of a series of papers on modeling the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and images of massive protostars , forming from massive gas cores under the paradigm of the turbulent core model .",
    "in the previous papers ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* here after paper ii ) ) , we studied a star - forming core with an initial mass of @xmath13 at the particular moment that the protostar reaches @xmath14 .",
    "we self - consistently included an active accretion disk allowing a supply of mass and angular momentum from the infall envelope and their loss to a disk wind , developed an approximate disk wind solution , and also included the corrections made by gas opacities , adiabatic cooling / heating and advection . a variant of this fiducial model has been used to successfully explain the multiwavelength observations ( both global sed and multiwavelength intensity profiles along the outflow axis ) of a massive protostar g35.2 - 0.74n ( @xcite ) . in this paper , extending the model developed in paper i and paper ii , we shall construct the evolutionary sequences of massive protostars , self - consistently from the specific initial environmental conditions of the pre - stellar core discussed above .",
    "we first assume a constant star formation efficiency ( the ratio of the stellar accretion rate to the ideal collapsing rate of the core assuming no feedback ) of half as in previous papers , but then introduce a new estimate for an evolving efficiency based on an analytic model of the disk wind outflow and its feedback on the core .",
    "as the outflow gradually opens up bipolar cavities , the instantaneous star formation efficiency decreases with time .",
    "we also improve the treatment of protostellar evolution with a detailed protostellar evolution code , which then utilizes the self - consistently calculated stellar accretion rate that is controlled by the formation efficiency .",
    "we present radiation transfer calculations of these models and their variants with different initial conditions at selected evolutionary stages .",
    "we discuss the model setup in section [ sec : models ] , and present the results of our models in section [ sec : result ] . in section [ sec : discussions ] , we discuss the possible effects of including the ambient clump material in the rt simulation , and how that affects the modeling of observations .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we first briefly describe those aspects of the model setup from our previous works that we will continue to use ( for details see paper i and ii ) , before discussing the new features in the following subsections .",
    "following mt03 , a star - forming core is defined as a region of a molecular cloud that forms a single star or a close binary via gravitational collapse .",
    "the core is assumed to be spherical , self - gravitating , in near virial equilibrium , and in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding clump . in the fiducial case ,",
    "we study a core with @xmath15 .",
    "the size of such a core is determined by the mean mass surface density of the clump @xmath1 ( which sets the pressure on the boundary of the core ) by @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 au in the fiducial case with @xmath15 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "we also consider variants of this model with several different values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the rotational energy which sets the disk size ( see section [ sec : disk ] ) , forming a small grid of models .",
    "these relations are based on the assumption of a singular polytropic core , which is consistent with observations of dense cores in infrared dark clouds .",
    "such observations suggest the density distribution in the core can be described by a power law in spherical radius , @xmath18 , with the mean value of @xmath19 estimated to be @xmath201.3 to 1.6 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "following paper i and ii , a fiducial value @xmath21 is used here .",
    "the collapse of the core is described with an inside - out expansion wave solution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is the expected collapse evolution of a singular polytropic sphere , although it is challenging to resolve such infall profiles around actual massive protostars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of rotation on the velocity field and the density profile are described with the solution by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the disk around a massive protostar can have a high mass . in all our models ,",
    "we assume the mass ratio between the disk and the protostar is a constant @xmath22 , considering the rise in effective viscosity due to disk self - gravity at about this value of @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disk structure is described with an `` @xmath24-disk '' solution ( @xcite ) , with an improved treatment to include the effects of the outflow and the accretion infall to the disk ( paper ii ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath24 varies from @xmath25 to @xmath26 in the fiducial model , given the constant disk - to - stellar mass ratio and the disk size ( see [ sec : disk ] ) .",
    "half of the accretion energy is released when the accretion flow reaches the stellar surface ( the boundary layer luminosity @xmath27 ) , but we assume this part of luminosity is radiated along with the stellar luminosity isotropically as a single black - body ( @xmath28 ) , i.e. we typically assume that there is minimal advection of gravitational energy into the star ( see section [ sec : prost ] ) . the other half of the accretion energy is partly radiated from the disk and partly converted to the kinetic energy of the disk wind .",
    "the density distribution in the outflow cavity is described by a semi - analytic disk wind solution which is approximately a @xcite ( hereafter bp ) wind ( see appendix b of paper ii ) , and the mass loading rate of the wind relative to the stellar accretion rate is assumed to be @xmath29 which is a typical value for disk winds ( @xcite ) . instead of assuming a fixed opening angle of the outflow cavity to reach an assumed star formation efficiency of half ( as we did in papers i and ii ) , in this paper we study the evolution of the outflow cavity .      , and @xmath5",
    ". the black curves are for a case of solid - rotating core , and the blue curves are for the case with @xmath30 to make a constant @xmath2 profile .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves are for different viewing inclinations ( they sometimes coincide ) .",
    "note the y axes are scaled by @xmath31 .",
    "the velocities are mass - weighted and averaged along the line of sight and also over sky plane in two ways .",
    "the most thick lines are averaged along a strip with infinite resolution in @xmath32 and width of core size , the lines with intermediate thickness are averaged over a circular resolution beam of 4000 au ( 4@xmath33 in 1 kpc ) .",
    "following @xcite , we also derive a gradient level using 2d linear fitting , which are marked with the most thin lines.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the rotation of the core is usually described with the parameter @xmath34 , the rotational - to - graviational energy ratio in the core . inside any radius @xmath35 in a polytropic core",

    "observationally , @xmath2 is derived by measuring the velocity gradient over the core ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and usually with assumptions that @xmath43 and @xmath40 .",
    "based on observations of both low - mass and high - mass cores , @xmath2 is found to have a typical value of 0.02 and range from @xmath440.001 to @xmath440.2 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we choose a fiducial value of 0.02 for @xmath2 .",
    "the profile of line - of - sight velocity @xmath45 with projected distance @xmath32 to the rotational axis can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the inclination angle between the rotational axis and the line of sight .",
    "the averaging effects of the velocity along the line of sight and over finite spatial resolutions are included in the factor @xmath48 .",
    "we note that the line - of - sight velocity and its gradient are proportional to @xmath49 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : velcore ] , we show the line - of - sight velocities and their gradients with the projected distance from the rotational axis for the fiducial initial core ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath21 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "profiles for different @xmath52 and inclinations are shown .",
    "note that the y axes are velocity or gradient scaled by @xmath31 . in most of cases",
    ", @xmath48 is only weakly dependent on @xmath47 .",
    "2d linearly fitted gradients following the method of @xcite are also shown . for models with different rotation curves ,",
    "the fitted gradients are actually similar , at a level of @xmath53 km / s / pc , which is higher than most of the observed values in the literatures mentioned above ( although similar gradient level has been observed in some cases , e.g. , @xcite ) , maybe because of the lower @xmath1 of the environments of their prestellar core samples .",
    "detailed rotation curves and @xmath34 profiles can be derived from observations with better spatial and velocity resolutions .",
    "if we assume the angular momentum is conserved inside the sonic point of the inflow , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total mass of the star and disk , and @xmath56 is the angular velocity when reaching the sonic point .",
    "this gives the size of the disk as the maximum centrifugal radius , @xmath57 therefore , in order to calculate @xmath58 at the moment that the collapsed mass ( the ideal star + disk mass in the case of no feedback , i.e. star formation efficiency of unity ) is @xmath59 , we need to know the radius where a shell enclosing that mass becomes supersonic in the past of the collapse , @xmath60 , and the initial angular velocity @xmath61 .",
    "the shell enclosing mass @xmath59 originally is at radius @xmath62 for a polytropic core . and the ratio between the radius where this shell reaches a supersonic infall velocity and its original radius is given by the expansion wave solution ( see appendix of @xcite ) , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the dimensionless radii of the sonic point and the expansion wave in the self - similar expansion wave solution , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the dimensionless masses at the center and inside the sonic point , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the times for the core to collapse and for the expansion wave to reach the core boundary , respectively . given by the expansion wave solution ,",
    "these parameters are only dependent on @xmath19 . in our case , with @xmath21 , we have @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , leading to @xmath75 .    for the initial polytropic core , for any @xmath35 , we can write the following for the gravitational and rotational energy inside that radius , @xmath76,\\ ] ] @xmath77,\\ ] ] with @xmath78 ( @xmath79 in the fiducial case with @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 ( @xmath820.286 in the fiducial case ) . therefore the averaged angular velocity @xmath83 inside @xmath35 is @xmath84 we assume a constant @xmath34 profile , @xmath85 , and use @xmath86 $ ] as an estimation of @xmath61 .",
    "we then are able to write equation [ eq : rd ] as @xmath87 this formula indicates that the size of the disk depends on the size of the core @xmath88 , the rotational energy fraction of the core @xmath2 , the averaged efficiency ( @xmath89 ) , and evolves with time as @xmath90 .",
    "if we do not use the averaged @xmath91 inside of some radius as @xmath56 , we will have an additional factor of about 2 increase for the disk size , which will not affect significantly the seds , as we will show later .",
    "however , if we do not assume a constant @xmath34 profile , for example , assuming a core rotating as a solid body , then @xmath92^{k_\\rho/(3-k_\\rho)}$ ] , the power law index of the term @xmath93 in equation [ eq : disk ] will become 5/3 , which makes the disks much smaller in the early stages .    @xcite wrote a formula for @xmath58 with the notation @xmath94 which is the ratio of the rotational speed to the keplerian speed at @xmath95 ( eq . 13 in their paper ) , @xmath96 here we have @xmath97 , since @xmath95 is the radius where a shell enclosing @xmath59 becomes supersonic during the collapse .",
    "then we have @xmath98 this corresponds to @xmath99 in the case @xmath21 .",
    "as we mentioned above , @xmath2 has a typical value of 0.02 and ranges from @xmath440.001 to @xmath440.2 . in paper",
    "i and ii , we used the original radius of a shell instead of the radius when it becomes supersonic ( i.e. , assumed angular momentum conservation from the start of the collapse ) , which led to a factor of @xmath100 larger disk sizes forming from a given core with a given @xmath59 . on the other hand , if the angular momentum is not well conserved even inside of the sonic point due to the existence of relatively strong magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the size of the disk could be even smaller .",
    "in order to explore the effects of different disk sizes , below we will study two additional cases with @xmath101 and 0.1 , besides the fiducial case with @xmath5 .",
    "after the expansion wave reaches the core boundary , self - similarity breaks down and equation [ eq : disk ] ceases to be valid , but for simplicity , we continue to use this formula after the expansion wave reaches the boundary , in a similar way to the extrapolation of the power law accretion rate in this regime by mt02 and mt03 .      in papers i and ii we used protostellar properties calculated by mt03 , which used a one - zone model for the protostellar evolution ( @xcite ) , that was adapted and calibrated to match multi - zone models . in a one zone model ,",
    "the protostar is treated as a polytropic sphere with the index @xmath102 chosen to have different values to mimic different states such as convective , radiative or intermediate .",
    "such a model is not able to solve the detailed evolution of the radiative or convective zone , and thus the resultant protostellar properties may not be very accurate . here",
    "we improve the protostellar properties by calculating them with a more detailed protostellar evolution model by @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter the hosokawa model ) which is based on the method developed by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this model solves the detailed internal structure of the protostar , such as the deuterium burning region , convective zone , and radiative zone .",
    "the evolution of the protostar depends on the accretion history , which is self - consistently calculated from the turbulent core model , including allowance for the evolution of the outflow cavities and their effects on star formation efficiency ( see section [ sec : openang ] ) .",
    "two options for the boundary conditions are available : one is the `` hot '' shock boundary condition , in which the protostar is surrounded by the accretion flow and the shock front produced when this flow hits the stellar surface .",
    "a fraction of the released gravitational energy is advected into the stellar interior , especially in the case of massive star formation , where the accretion rate is high so that the accretion flow surrounding the protostar becomes optically thick .",
    "such a condition is usually associated with the case of spherical accretion ( however see @xcite ) .",
    "the other is the `` cold '' photospheric boundary condition , in which the protostellar surface is the photosphere .",
    "in such a case , the released gravitational energy is mostly radiated away , except the small fraction converted to the thermal energy of the accretion flow itself , therefore the entropy carried by the accretion flow can be assumed same as the gas in the stellar photosphere .",
    "this condition is normally associated with accretion via a thin disk . in reality",
    ", the situation would be something evolving between these two limits , and may be mimicked by switching between these two boundary conditions during the protostellar evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "although very uncertain , comparison between the models and observations for low - mass stars indicates that the stars with higher masses are likely to have experienced the hot accretion condition in their early stages ( @xcite ) . with even higher initial accretion rates , massive stars should be more likely to be so .",
    "therefore , in all the models presented here , we start with the hot boundary condition at an initial mass of @xmath103 .",
    "the choice of the initial mass and radius of the protostar is not so important because under the hot boundary condition the evolution is not sensitive to these two initial conditions .",
    "we then switch to the cold boundary condition when the outflow cavity breaks out from the core , approximating the transition of the end of significant spherical accretion to the protostar . in our models",
    ", this transition typically occurs at masses @xmath104 .",
    "as we will show below , our results are not so dependent on the choice of this transition time .",
    "note that our protostellar evolution does not consider the effects of the stellar rotation .",
    "as shown in papers i and ii , the outflow cavities are the most significant features affecting the infrared sed and morphology up to @xmath105 m .",
    "the opening angle of the outflow cavity affects how the massive protostar is revealed to the observer .",
    "the outflow also sweeps up part of the core , consuming mass , angular momentum , and energy from the star - disk system , thereby regulating the accretion rate and therefore the protostellar properties and the star formation efficiency . in this section ,",
    "we study the evolution of the opening angle of the outflow cavities , and estimate the star formation efficiency and the accretion history of the protostar .",
    "following section 2.3 of paper i , from mass conservation we have @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the collapse rate of the polytropic core ( i.e. the ideal accretion rate onto the star and the disk in the case of no feedback ) , and for the turbulent core model , it is @xmath108 equation [ eq : mdots ] states that because of the outflow cavity with an opening angle of @xmath109 , only a fraction of @xmath110 of the collapsing material feeds the star and disk system , from which @xmath111 accretes on the protostar , @xmath112 stays on the disk , and @xmath113 leaves into the outflow , but only @xmath114 actually ends up escaping from the outflow cavity . here , we adopt @xmath115 and @xmath116 as constants , but @xmath117 depends on the angular mass distribution and the opening angle of the outflow cavity .",
    "we then define the instantaneous star formation efficiency as @xmath118 therefore , in order to estimate the accretion rate and the efficiency , we need to find out @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    to evaluate the opening angle @xmath109 and its growth , we follow the method of @xcite . towards any polar angle @xmath121",
    ", the disk wind has certain momentum flux , which is higher in the polar direction and lower in the equatorial direction .",
    "for some @xmath121 , there will be a time that the total momentum outflow in this direction becomes high enough to accelerate the core material to its escape speed @xmath122",
    ". then this polar angle will be the opening angle @xmath109 at that moment .",
    "such a condition can be written as @xmath123 here @xmath124 is the escape velocity from the core , @xmath125 is the angular distribution of the core mass which can be written as @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the angular distribution of the wind momentum which can be expressed as @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "the core material is assumed to be swept up through a thin , radiative shocked shell with purely radial motion under monopole gravity , and the factor @xmath130 in the above equation accounts for the effects of gravity on the propagation of this shocked core shell .",
    "then the condition for the opening angle @xmath109 is @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "we assume the mass of the core is isotropically distributed , i.e. , @xmath133 . in reality",
    ", the core is flattened to some degree due to rotation and/or large scale magnetic field support .",
    "the distribution of momentum with the polar angle of an x - wind or a fully extended disk wind can be described as ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a small angle , which is estimated to be @xmath136 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then equation [ eq : esc1 ] becomes @xmath137 where the parameter @xmath138 using the results of @xcite , we estimate @xmath139 for the fiducial core with @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the case that the steady winds continuously sweep the shell even outside the core boundary .",
    "the momentum @xmath142 is an integration of the momentum flux of the wind @xmath143 from the first launch of the wind to the current time @xmath144 , with @xmath143 provided by the disk wind solution : @xmath145 a bp wind is assumed here , with the density at the base of the wind @xmath146 , the vertical velocity at the base of the wind @xmath147 ( also see paper ii ) .",
    "@xmath148 is the terminal speed of the disk wind ( @xcite ) , with @xmath149 is the keplerian speed at the stellar surface .",
    "@xmath150 is used here , following the fiducial value in the bp wind solution .",
    "@xcite wrote equation [ eq : pdot ] in the form of @xmath151 .",
    "our estimate corresponds to @xmath152 /\\ln(r_d",

    "note when @xmath153 , @xmath154 only has a weak dependence on the outer radius of the disk . for a typical disk size of 100 au and a stellar radius of 10 @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "we then estimate @xmath117 , the fraction of the mass of the wind that can escape from the outflow cavity . the momentum distribution with the polar angle can be written as @xmath157",

    "now we discuss whether the momentum distribution of equation [ eq : pmu ] is still valid in such an interpolated approximate wind solution .",
    "we can write the momentum distribution with the polar angle as @xmath167 where @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",

    ", we have @xmath172 with @xmath173 and @xmath174 is the opening angle of the inner wind cavity close to the axis .",
    "we can rewrite this equation to @xmath175 with @xmath176 for a fully extended wind , @xmath177 , we estimate @xmath178",
    ".    then we find @xmath179 with @xmath180 since @xmath181 is normalized , equation [ eq : pmu ] is valid as long as @xmath182 does not vary much over @xmath121 .",
    "the variation of @xmath182 is within a factor of @xmath183 to 3 except very close to the axis .",
    "so we argue the assumed form of the momentum distribution ( equation [ eq : pmu ] ) is approximately consistent with the interpolated wind solution .",
    "firstly , we construct three groups of models covering the evolutionary sequence of a massive star that is forming out of a core with @xmath50 , @xmath141 and @xmath5 .",
    "model group i assumes a constant efficiency @xmath184 , and the protostellar evolution model of mt03 .",
    "group ii updates the protostellar evolution to the hosokawa model , but still with the constant efficiency of 0.5 .",
    "group iii ( fiducial model ) further allows varying efficiency , self - consistently calculated from the initial conditions of the core and the properties of the outflow ; the accretion history for the protostellar evolution changes accordingly .",
    "each group contains models for the stages when the protostar reaches @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 . for those models after the expansion wave reaches the boundary , we simply lower the density but keep the shape of the density profile and a fixed outer radius of the core , normalizing to the amount of remaining core envelope mass ( this assumes negligible continued accretion to the core from the ambient clump ) .",
    "we then construct variants of the fiducial model ( model group iii ) , to explore the dependence of the evolutionary sequences on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "besides the fiducial model with a core embedded in @xmath10 environment , we construct another two groups of models with @xmath192 and @xmath193 , covering a range of @xmath1 of a factor of 10 .",
    "we construct two model groups with the same @xmath194 and @xmath195 as the fiducial model , but with a higher @xmath196 and a lower @xmath101 , to show the effects of different disk sizes .",
    "another two model groups with @xmath197 and @xmath198 are also constructed .    in the turbulent core model ,",
    "the core is embedded in a larger star - cluster - forming clump .",
    "this clump contributes far - ir to mm emission from the cold material , and also provides additional foreground extinction .",
    "especially , due to the lower angular resolutions of single dish far - infrared instruments , observations in this wavelength range usually can not resolve the dense core from its ambient clump in typical galactic massive star - forming regions .",
    "therefore , when comparing the theoretical model to real observations , it is important to simulate the effects of the ambient clump , or subtract its contribution from the observations . in order to investigate this",
    ", we construct another variant of the fiducial model with a surrounding clump self - consistently included .",

    "the opacity gradually becomes lower , the transparent region which is losing energy to outer layers , is moving outward .",

    "this dramatic increase in the stellar radius leads to a sudden decrease in the accretion luminosity @xmath230 , and most of the stellar interior becoming radiative makes the stellar luminosity increase significantly and it becomes the dominant luminosity component .",
    "the fast swelling phase is followed by kelvin - helmholz contraction at @xmath232 . at @xmath233 , hydrogen burning starts and the protostar reaches the main - sequence . in the models presented here , the main - sequence luminosity is dominated by the cno - cycle process of hydrogen burning .",

    "in such a case , the interior temperature is actually lower , causing later starts of the deuterium burning and the luminosity wave phase .",
    "the kh contraction in turn happens later in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolutions in models with the cold boundary condition are quite similar . with an earlier start of the cold boundary condition ,",
    "the initial contraction stage starts earlier , leading to an earlier start of deuterium burning .",
    "in such a case , the radius before the fast swelling is smaller , but reaches a higher peak at the end of the fast swelling stage .",
    "however , the variation in the radius is within a factor of 2 in the mass range that we are interested here .",
    "also they start the luminosity wave stage at similar masses and have very similar evolution profiles from later kh contraction phase to main sequence .",
    "therefore , even though at a certain mass ( e.g. @xmath234 ) , the stellar radius is strongly affected by the choice on when to switch from hot to cold boundary condition , the general trend will not be affected , as long as we sample enough @xmath210 to cover different evolutionary stages .",

    "the star formation is much faster in the high surface density environments .",

    "on the other hand , the evolution of the protostellar properties with stellar mass are very similar , especially the stellar + boundary layer accretion luminosity seems to only depend on the stellar mass .",
    "due to the different accretion rates , the protostellar radius and the beginning of the luminosity wave stage and the main sequence stage are affected by @xmath0 , but not as strongly as by @xmath1 , since the accretion rate is more affected by the environmental surface density ( the accretion rate @xmath241 , see equation [ eq : mcdot ] ) . in table",

    "such diagrams are used to identify the evolutionary stages of protostars ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we see such evolution of the model tracks on this diagram . especially , sources in the main accretion phase can be recognized in the lower - right part of this diagram and the sources in the envelope clear - up phase generally occupy the upper - left region of the diagram , with the division running diagonally through the turning points of each evolutionary track .",
    "however , one needs to be cautious when comparing this diagram with observations .",
    "first , only the core mass is included here , while in real observations , additional clump material will usually be included due to low resolutions in single - dish fir observations , which will cause the tracks to move to the right .",
    "so careful subtraction of the clump material needs to be made in order to compare the observation to the models .",
    "second , as we will show below , because more radiation from the protostar is emitted in polar directions due to the anisotropic envelope , the integrated bolometric luminosity from seds can be different by an order of magnitude or more depending on the inclination .",

    "as the protostar grows , due to the increase of the luminosity , the envelope is gradually heated up .",
    "we assumed that if the streamline of the outflow originates from the outer dusty disk ( with temperature at surface lower than 1400 k ) , then the wind is dusty too .",
    "the dusty and dust - free regions of the outflow can be seen in the temperature profiles as the dusty part can be heated more easily and is thus warmer .",

    "but in the later stages ( @xmath248 , 12 , 16 , 24 @xmath249 ) , the fraction ( volume and mass ) of the outflow cavity which is dusty gradually becomes larger .",
    "whether this dusty outflow exists or not ( e.g. , we are ignoring possible destruction of dust by internal shocks in the outflow ) also affects the temperature of the envelope and certainly affects the infrared appearance of the outflow cavities .",

    ", the envelope is heated from @xmath44 30 k in the earliest stage up to @xmath44 60 k in the later stages .",
    "this factor is also strongly affecting the envelope temperatures with different @xmath1 , since the core with a higher @xmath1 has a higher accretion rate and luminosity . in the model with @xmath250 , the envelope in the late stages is heated to close 80 k , @xmath251 k higher than the temperature in the model with @xmath252 . on the other hand ,",
    "the envelope temperature is not so dependent on the initial core mass @xmath0 , since the luminosity evolution appears very similar in models with different @xmath0 but the same @xmath1 .",
    "the second factor is the size of the envelope .",
    "a bigger envelope will have more cold material in the outer region , leading to a lower mean temperature , as shown by comparing the models with the same @xmath1 but different @xmath0 in their early stages .",
    "the third factor is the opening angle of the outflow cavity .",
    "especially , in the final stage , the outflow cavity is very wide , so that the residual envelope in the low latitude is harder to be heated by the stellar radiation because of the shielding from the disk and the dusty outflow .",
    "this explains the decrease of the envelope temperature in the latest stages in all of the five models .",
    "the higher envelope temperatures in the late stages in the model with higher @xmath0 are also caused by the smaller outflow cavity .",
    "fourth , the stellar temperature may also have an effect .",
    "the drop or slow increase in the envelope temperature at @xmath231 may be caused by the sudden decrease of the protostellar temperature during the fast swelling phase .",
    "these models predict that , even in the low @xmath253 case , the envelope temperature quickly reaches @xmath254  k , which has implications for co freeze - out and deuteration of particular species such as @xmath255 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "although the accretion history is same in model groups i and ii , the earlier start of deuterium burning in model group ii produces more energy which is being radiated from the protostar in the kh contraction stage . but these appear to be minor effects compared to that caused by different histories of formation efficiency and the opening angle of the outflow cavity . with the outflow cavity evolving self - consistently ,",
    "model group iii starts with a small outflow cavity , making the fluxes at short wavelengths much lower and the far - ir peak much higher at the beginning .",

    "the red curves show the scattered light only . as long as the line of sight passes through the envelope ,",
    "the fluxes at short wavelengths are scattering dominated .",

    "detailed comparison among these three models at each stage is shown in figure [ fig : sed_sigma_ms ] .",
    "the differences in the seds are caused by several factors .",
    "first , at any given stage , the luminosity increases with @xmath1 ( see the sixth panel of figure [ fig : evolution_sigma ] ) . in the earlier stages ( @xmath263 ) , this is because of the higher accretion rate with a higher @xmath1 ; in later stages ( @xmath264 ) , this is caused by the higher stellar luminosity in the case of a higher @xmath1 .",
    "especially the far - ir peak is affected by the total luminosity .",
    "second , the mid - ir fluxes are affected by the extinction of the envelope which is lower in the low @xmath1 case , causing the mid - ir fluxes in such a model to be often higher than in the other two cases at the same inclination angle .",
    "third , the evolution of the protostellar radius after the luminosity wave stage ( e.g. , @xmath265 , 8 , 12 @xmath249 ) is very different depending on @xmath1 , affecting the stellar surface temperature and the input stellar spectrum , which causes differences in the short wavelength seds in these stages .",
    "fourth , the outflow cavity is developing faster in the lower @xmath1 case since the core is less dense and it is easier for the outflow to sweep up the core material .",
    "this affects the sed in the later stages .",
    "for example , at @xmath266 , the line of sight with an inclination of @xmath257 passes through the outflow cavity in the model with @xmath10 , but still passes through the envelope in the model with higher @xmath1 , which causes the differences on the seds shown in the left - bottom panel .",
    "figure [ fig : sed_beta ] compares the seds of the fiducial model and its two variants with different disk sizes . as discussed in section [ sec : disk ] , the models with @xmath196 have disks five times larger than the fiducial model with @xmath5 , which also makes the disks thiner and less dense .",
    "the opposite is true for the model with @xmath101 . in most of the cases ,",
    "the fluxes are higher with larger disks , which may be caused by the fact that with a larger disk , the outflow cavity is wider at the base , a larger fraction of the outflow is launched from the outer dusty disk and becomes dusty according to our assumption , leading to a warm dusty region around the disk at the base of the outflow . also with a thiner disk",
    "the radiation from the protostar is less shielded .",
    "this difference can be seen at wavelengths @xmath267 m in earlier stages , and gradually is seen in the fir when the outflow opening angle becomes larger and the disk becomes more exposed .",
    "the significant differences at wavelengths @xmath268 m at @xmath269 are caused by the different evolution of the protostellar radius in these three models around these stages . to sum up , the sed at wavelengths @xmath270 m is not so sensitive to a factor of 25 variation in disk size .    due to the existence of the low - density outflow cavity ,",
    "the extinction varies with the inclination of the viewing angle , and more radiation is escaping from the polar direction , which is known as the `` flashlight effect '' ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "this causes the bolometric luminosity integrated from an observed sed to be larger or lower than the true bolometric luminosity of the source by a factor up to several depending on whether the source is face - on or edge - on .",
    "figure [ fig : flashlight ] shows this flashlight effect at different evolutionary stages in the fiducial model . here , 20 inclinations evenly distributed in cosine ( i.e. with equal probability to be observed in such an angle ) are shown . at early stages , as the outflow cavity is still small , over most of the range of inclinations the inferred directed bolometric luminosity is close to the true total luminosity ; the exception is if the source is seen at a nearly face - on view ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "the flashlight effect becomes stronger in the later stages when a wider outflow cavity ( @xmath272 ) has developed . in these cases , from face - on view to edge - on view , the inferred luminosity varies from higher than the true bolometric luminosity by a factor of @xmath273 to lower by a factor of @xmath274 . due to this factor",
    ", caution needs to be taken when using the observed total luminosity to infer the mass of a massive protostar . for example , including possible flashlight effect , @xcite estimate the total luminosity of the massive protostar g35.2 - 0.74n to be larger than the directly inferred luminosity by a factor of 2 - 6 , leading to a protostellar mass significantly higher than some previously inferred values .    from the seds",
    ", we can also calculate the bolometric temperature , which is defined as ( citealt[]ml93 ) @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the flux weighted mean frequency .",
    "with such a definition , one can expect that @xmath277 will rise as a yso evolves and the envelope is dispersed .",
    "therefore , the bolometric temperature is useful as an indicator of evolutionary sequence , rather than representing the thermal conditions of the envelope . as shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : tevo_bol ] , @xmath277 is generally higher than the mass weighted envelope temperature even in the early stages when the cold fir emitting envelope dominates the sed",
    ". then @xmath277 rises dramatically in the later stages up to @xmath278 k. since @xmath277 is derived from the sed , we also expect it is highly dependent on the inclination , and affected by the ambient clump material ( see section [ sec : clump ] ) .",
    "indeed , from figure [ fig : tevo_bol ] , we see that @xmath277 is much higher in a more face - on view . also the bolometric luminosity is lower when including the ambient clump material , which provides additional extinction and cold fir emitting material . in figure",
    "[ fig : tevo_bol ] , we also show the evolution of @xmath277 in five models with different @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they all start from @xmath4440 to 50 k and rapidly increase to @xmath279  k as the outflow cavity widens . in the later stages , at the same @xmath210 , the outflow opening angle is much smaller in a model with higher @xmath0 causing the difference in @xmath277 between the models with different @xmath0 .      the evolutionary stages of protostars are usually identified from the shape of the sed , e.g. , colors or slope index at certain wavelength range .",
    "the deeply embedded early phase usually shows high far - ir fluxes but little mid - ir or near - ir fluxes .",
    "the short wavelength fluxes increase as the source evolves to later stage .",
    "however there are degeneracies caused by inclination , for example , at an edge - on view the fluxes in the near- and mid - ir are much lower than those at a face - on view , mimicking the sed of an early stage protostar .",
    "different core properties such as their masses and mass surface densities may also introduce additional scatter . in this section ,",
    "we study if we can tell the evolutionary sequences from the observed colors of the sources , in spite of different inclinations , surface densities and initial core masses .",
    "figure [ fig : cc_sigma ] shows a color - color diagram of the fiducial model , along with the two models with higher and lower @xmath1 , and another two models with different disk sizes . here the color [ x @xmath12m]-[y @xmath12 m ] is simply defined as @xmath280 $ ] . for each model at each evolutionary stage , data points of 20 inclinations evenly sampled in the cosine space are shown .",
    "fluxes at wavelengths longer than 24 @xmath12 m are used to minimize the scatter caused by the inclination . in these bands ,",
    "the colors appear to be less dependent on the inclinations .",
    "most of the data points of different inclinations are clustered together on the diagram except in the later stages when the outflow cavity becomes quite wide . at earlier stages ,",
    "data points of low inclinations show some scatter on [ 24 @xmath12m]-[70 @xmath12 m ] color .",
    "but for each model , the evolutionary stages are clearly distinguishable in such a diagram .",
    "the colors are not so affected by the disk sizes . but significant scatter can be caused by the different surface densities of the star - forming environments . especially , compared to the fiducial models , the model with lower @xmath1 has a significant shift in the [ 24 @xmath12m]-[70 @xmath12 m ] colors . however , despite the scatter , the general trend of the colors with the evolution of the protostars is still obvious .",
    "the colors for the models with different initial core masses are shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : cc_mcore ] .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of these three models lie close together , indicating that , among the three initial conditions ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) we explore here , the location of a evolutionary track on such a color - color diagram is only strongly dependent on the environmental surface density @xmath1 .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : cc_sigma ] , a general dependence of the colors on the evolutionary stage is evident .",
    "however , given a position on such a color - color diagram , it is difficult to find the particular protostellar mass . especially , in the early stages ( @xmath281 ) and the late stages ( @xmath282 ) , the points of different @xmath210 overlap with each other . instead of the protostellar mass ,",
    "the scaled protostellar mass by the initial core mass ( @xmath240 ) may be a better indicator of the evolutionary stage , since the evolution of the outflow cavity is more dependent on @xmath240 than @xmath210 , and the opening angle of the outflow cavity significantly affects the seds and the colors .",
    "as the lower panel of figure [ fig : cc_mcore ] shows , the scatter on the color - color diagram is significantly improved with this scaled protostellar mass , especially in the early stages .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in the upper panel of figure [ fig : colmass ] , where we show the evolution of the [ 70 @xmath12m]-[160 @xmath12 m ] color with the scaled protostellar mass ( @xmath240 ) in five models with different @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the scatter is large for the intermediate stage .",
    "this is caused by the different protostellar evolution histories in these models .",
    "the scatter at the middle stages becomes much smaller if we scale the protostellar mass by the protostellar mass at the luminosity wave stage @xmath242 , as shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : colmass ] .",
    "this implies that after the protostar reaches its luminosity wave stage , the sudden increase of the stellar radius and the corresponding decrease of the stellar surface temperature cause significant change of the colors even in the far - ir bands . on a color - color diagram such as figure [ fig : cc_mcore ] ,",
    "before the protostar reaches the luminosity wave stage , a source appears on the upper - right region , and moves to the lower - left region in the luminosity wave stage and the following kh contraction stages . if the accretion rate increases with time ( except at very late stage )",
    "as the turbulent core model predicts , this transition on the color - color diagram can be fast compared to the duration of the early and late stages , therefore a large sample of massive protostars may appear as two groups on such a color - color diagram , as indicated by some studies of large sample of massive protostars ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results indicate that the color - color diagram can be very useful to determine the evolutionary stages of a massive protostar , although there is scatter caused by the environmental surface density and the initial mass of the core .",
    "the scatter due to the inclination can be minimized by using the colors at longer wavelengths . at early and late stages",
    ", the color seems to be more dependent on the time frame of star formation ( @xmath240 ) , while in the middle stages , the color seems to indicate the relative stage of protostellar evolution .",
    "however , additional scatter may be introduced in by possible binarity , or the uncertainty of the ambient clump environment .",

    "for the model at each stage , the images are produced with @xmath283 photon packets in the radiation transfer simulation , but the noise caused by the monte - carlo method can still be seen in the most embedded cases and at short wavelengths , due to the low flux levels .",
    "note all the images are normalized to their maximum surface brightness , therefore the images of different stages or at different wavelengths are not supposed to be compared directly .    from these images",
    ", one can clearly sees that , when the line of sight is not passing through the outflow cavity ( @xmath260 , 2 , 4 , 8 @xmath249 at @xmath256 inclination and @xmath260 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 @xmath249 at @xmath257 inclination ) , the outflow cavity has significant influence on the infrared morphology of the source , especially at wavelengths of @xmath284 m , where the emission is dominated by the warm inner region and the heated outflow cavity wall . the gradually opening - up of the outflow cavity can be clearly seen , especially at a higher inclination . at later stages",
    "when the outflow has developed a dusty region , the extended emission from the dust in the outflow cavity also becomes relatively bright at these wavelengths ( e.g. , when @xmath210 = 8 , 12 , 16 @xmath249 ) .",
    "note the fiducial model does not include the material outside the core radius , i.e. , the self - gravitating clump that is pressurizing the core , therefore in reality , the appearance of the extended outflow outside the core would be affected by additional extinction and emission from such a clump ( see section [ sec : clump ] ) . at @xmath105 m and longer wavelength ,",
    "the emission starts to be dominated by the envelope and the near - facing and far - facing sides of the outflow become quite symmetric , but at @xmath105 m at a higher inclination , the bright part is still elongated along the direction of the outflow cavity . at shorter wavelengths , such as k band or 3.6 @xmath12 m , due to the large extinction of the envelope , most of the emission comes from the near - facing side ,",
    "although the peak moves from the near - facing side to the center as the protostar evolves to have a wider outflow cavity and less dense envelope .",
    "when the line of sight passes through the outflow cavity , the images are dominated by the bright center and inner region of the envelope heated by the star and the disk .",
    "the model images can be compared with observations more quantitatively using the intensity distributions along the outflow axis ( @xcite ) or perpendicular to the direction of the outflow .",
    "figure [ fig : flux_v ] shows such intensity profiles at four wavelengths along the projected outflow axis in models of different @xmath1 at various evolutionary stages . at an inclination of @xmath257 , the near - facing outflow is usually brighter than the far - facing outflow , due to the lower extinction of the envelope .",
    "however , since this extinction is dependent on the wavelength , the contrast of the two sides of the outflow is lower when observed at a longer wavelength , e.g. , the profiles at 37 @xmath12 m are much more symmetric than those at the other three wavelengths .",
    "this asymmetry between the near - facing and far - facing outflows is also affected by the surface densities of the star formation environment .",
    "the core with a low @xmath1 has profiles more symmetric and more peaked towards the center .",
    "evolution of the intensity distribution with the growth of the protostar is more complicated , due to a combination of several factors .",
    "the first is that the extinction of the envelope is decreasing as the core collapses and the protostar grows .",
    "the profiles at short wavelengths , such as 3.6 @xmath12 m , are especially sensitive to this factor .",
    "the peaks of the intensity profiles at this wavelength move from the near - facing side toward the center as the protostar grows . meanwhile , the contrast of the two sides of the outflow decreases .",
    "second , as the protostar grows , the outer envelope and outflow cavity wall is becoming warmer , which brings up the the wings the intensity profiles , especially in the cases with lower surface densities ( e.g. the profiles at 20 and 37 @xmath12 m in the models with @xmath285 and 1 @xmath286 ) .",
    "third , in the high @xmath1 case the asymmetry between the near - facing and far - facing sides of the outflow actually increases as the outflow cavity gradually opens up ( e.g. 10 @xmath12 m profiles in the @xmath287 model ) .",
    "figure [ fig : flux_h ] shows the intensity profiles along a strip perpendicular to the outflow axis with a projected offset to the center of @xmath288 . in most of the cases and wavelengths ,",
    "the profile becomes wider as the protostar grows , reflecting the opening up of the outflow cavity , except in the case with @xmath287 at 10 , and 20 @xmath12 m , in which case the emission is still dominated by the envelope due to the high surface density in early stages , while only at later stages does the outflow cavity start to reveal itself , making the profile narrower . for a model at the same stage , the profile ( especially the brightest part ) is narrower in 10 and 20 @xmath12 m than in 3.6 @xmath12 m , even though the actual opening angle of the outflow is same , which is most evident in the case with @xmath10 .",

    "therefore a group of these lines shows the region a model will occupy at different evolutionary stages and inclinations .",

    "although we use the mean mass surface density of the clump , @xmath1 , to self - consistently set the conditions for the core and its evolution , the surrounding clump itself provides additional extinction and emission , which will affect the seds and images . here",
    "we construct a variant of the fiducial model to include a clump with very simple structures , and briefly discuss how such a clump would affect the sed and images .",
    "we assume the clump density decreases with the spherical radius as a power law @xmath289 , with the power - law index @xmath290 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the clump starts at the core boundary with a density which is half of the core density at the boundary .",

    "the short wavelength emission is lower than the model without the clump but higher than that observed with a smaller aperture at wavelengths @xmath293 m .",
    "this is because the short wavelength emission can be seen towards the opening area of the outflow cavity , and this part of the emission is excluded with a smaller aperture . in real observations , depending on the resolutions in different bands ,",
    "the observed seds may be similar to the model sed with smaller aperture in short wavelengths , but similar to the model sed with full aperture in long wavelengths , i.e. , the short wavelength fluxes are strongly suppressed but the fluxes at @xmath294 m becomes higher with the clump .    the influence of the clump on the sed can also be reflected on the color - color diagram .",

    "the colors are calculated with fluxes either provided in the above literatures , or from interpolating the well sampled seds presented in these works .",

    "longer than @xmath296 m , the clump contributes to the extended emission . at wavelengths of 8 , 10 and 20 @xmath12 m ,",

    "the models developed in paper i and ii were used to explain observations of a massive protostar g35.2 - 0.74n ( @xcite ) , by fitting both the seds and the intensity profiles along the outflow axis . here",
    "we briefly discuss how the improved model we present here would affect the modeling of the observations .",
    "first , unlike the model in paper i and ii , we now have a self - consistent model describing how the outflow cavity gradually opens up , therefore we can better model the observed lateral intensity distribution across the outflow cavity to constrain the opening angle of the outflow . from figure",
    "[ fig : img_60 ] , the observed morphologies of g35.2 - 0.74n at 10 , 20 and 40 @xmath12",
    "m are similar to those at the stages @xmath210 = 8 or 12 @xmath249 , i.e. , an outflow cavity with an opening angle of @xmath297 ( from axis to the cavity wall ) with an inclination of @xmath298 can produce a similar ir morphology to this source . for a more massive core",
    ", an outflow cavity evolves to this size at higher stellar masses , e.g. , @xmath299 in a core with initial 240 @xmath249 mass .",
    "such a stellar mass agrees with our estimate from the bolometric luminosity .",
    "second , as discussed in the previous section , the core is embedded in a larger clump .",
    "our model with a simplified clump structure suggests that the clump can significantly affect the sed and images . in reality , the clump ( and indeed the core ) can be highly turbulent and thus much more complicated than that in our model",
    ". therefore , appropriately subtracting the contribution of the clump from the sed and the image is important in modeling the observations .",
    "a recent high resolution sub - mm interferometric observation ( @xcite ) reveals multiple cores within a scale of @xmath300 near to the center of this source ( 22000 au at a distance of 2.2 kpc ) , with one of the cores associated with the observed ir outflow cavity .",
    "the other cores in the turbulent clump contribute to the long wavelength emission , and are not resolved in the far - ir observations .",
    "a more accurate fitting with the model can be done with the contribution from these cores carefully estimated and subtracted .",
    "we have constructed radiation transfer models for individual massive star formation , covering the whole evolutionary sequence , for various initial conditions of massive star formation .",
    "\\1 . based on the model constructed for a single evolutionary stage presented in papers i and paper ii",
    ", we now self - consistently calculate the evolution of the opening angle of the outflow , the instantaneous star - formation efficiency , the accretion rate , the size of the disk and the protostellar properties .",
    "the initial conditions are assumed based on the turbulent core model ( mt03 ) , and the collapse is described with an inside - out expansion wave solution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of the outflow opening angle is determined by the criteria that the momentum of a disk wind is strong enough to sweep up the core ( @xcite ) .",
    "the protostellar evolution is improved with a detailed multi - zone model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in such a framework , an evolutionary track is determined by three environmental initial conditions : the initial core mass @xmath0 , the mean surface density of the ambient clump @xmath1 , and the rotational to gravitational energy ratio in the initial core @xmath2 . in the fiducial model with @xmath15 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the final mass of the protostar can reach @xmath301 , making the final average star formation efficiency @xmath7 .",
    "other models with different initial conditions also have similar efficiencies , with a trend that a higher efficiency is achieved at higher @xmath1 .",
    "the projected temperature maps at different evolutionary stages are shown , which potentially can be compared with observations .",
    "as the protostar grows , the mass - weighted temperature of the envelope can increase by @xmath44 30 k. the temperature of the core in a high surface density environment is much warmer than that in a low surface density region , because the core in a high @xmath1 environment is denser and more compact , leading to a higher accretion rate and luminosity .",
    "the temperature of the envelope is not so dependent on the initial core mass , although with a more massive and thus larger core , in the early stages the mean temperature is slightly lower because of the cold material in the outer region . in later stages ,",
    "the envelope temperature is affected by the development of the outflow cavity .",
    "seds of the models with different star formation efficiency , protostellar evolution , environmental mass surface densities and disk sizes are presented .",
    "to correctly explain an observation , a realistic evolutionary model of the star - formation efficiency and the outflow opening angle is required , while the effects of different protostellar evolution models are smaller .",
    "generally , as the protostar grows , the fluxes at wavelengths shorter than @xmath302 m increase dramatically while the fluxes at longer wavelengths do not change much ; the far - ir peaks also move to shorter wavelengths .",
    "the seds are affected by the environmental surface density @xmath1 due to the different accretion rates , extinctions , and evolutions of the outflow cavities and the protostars .",
    "we explored the effects of different disk sizes on the sed by adjusting the value of @xmath2 .",
    "a change of a factor of 25 in the disk size has a relatively small impact on the sed at wavelengths @xmath11 m , especially when the line of sight passes through the envelope so that the disk is less exposed . derived from seds , the bolometric temperature increases rapidly from @xmath303 k to @xmath278 k as the outflow cavity opens up , which may be used as an indicator of evolutionary stages .",
    "however , it is strongly affected by the inclination and the potential contribution of the cold ambient material .    \\4 .",
    "we studied how the inferred luminosity depends on the viewing angle ( the flashlight effect ) and its evolution with the growth of the protostar .",
    "compared to the true bolometric luminosity , the inferred luminosity from sed can be higher or lower by a factor of several depending on whether the source is face - on or edge - on , once a wide - angle outflow cavity has developed .",
    "such a factor needs to be considered when using the sed to infer the luminosity and estimate the mass of the protostar .",
    "we find the color - color diagram at long wavelengths ( such as the color [ @xmath304m]-[@xmath305 m ] , [ @xmath305m]-[@xmath306 m ] ) can be a useful tool to determine the evolutionary stages of a massive protostar .",
    "the scatter caused by the inclination can be minimized using colors at these long wavelengths .",
    "additional scatter is caused by initial conditions like the core mass and the surface density of the environment , but a general trend of evolutionary sequences can be clearly seen on such a color - color diagram . and",
    "we find that at early and late stages , the color is more dependent on @xmath240 , while in the middle stages , the color is affected by the swelling phase of the protostar , and more dependent on the relative stage of protostellar evolution .",
    "the fast color change due to the swelling phase of protostellar evolution may cause massive protostars appear as two groups on such a color - color diagram .",
    "images of the fiducial model at selected evolutionary stages and observational bands are presented .",
    "the development of the outflow cavity with a gradually wider opening angle is seen on the images especially at @xmath284 m .",
    "intensity profiles along and perpendicular to the outflow axis are shown .",
    "such profiles can be compared to the observations to constrain the properties of the outflows from massive protostars , such as the opening angle and the inclination .",
    "the near - facing and far - facing sides of the outflow become more symmetric as the source is observed at a longer wavelength , or if the source is in an environment of a lower surface density .",
    "the profiles are affected by the evolution of the source due to several reasons , including the gradually lower extinction of the envelope , wider outflow cavity , and warmer outer envelope as the protostar grows .",
    "we compared the seds , color - color diagram , and images of models with or without the ambient star - cluster - forming clump surrounding the protostellar core .",
    "such a clump provides additional extinction at short wavelengths and emission at long wavelengths , both of which can significantly affect the observed sed and the position on the color - color diagram . including the clump also produces a more extended envelope and outflow cavity structure .",
    "although our model of the clump is very simple , its impact on the seds and images suggest that it is important to carefully estimate the contribution from the ambient clump material when comparing the model to the observations .",

    "<S> we present radiation transfer simulations of evolutionary sequences of massive protostars forming from massive dense cores in environments of high mass surface densities , based on the turbulent core model ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the protostellar evolution is calculated with a multi - zone numerical model , with accretion rate regulated by feedback from an evolving disk - wind outflow cavity . </S>",
    "<S> disk evolution is calculated assuming a fixed ratio of disk to protostellar mass , while core envelope evolution assumes inside - out collapse of the core of fixed outer radius . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> an evolutionary track is determined by three environmental initial conditions : core mass @xmath0 , mass surface density of the ambient clump @xmath1 , and ratio of the core s initial rotational to gravitational energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary sequences with various @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 are constructed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in a fiducial model with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the final mass of the protostar reaches at least @xmath6 , making the final star formation efficiency @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for each of the evolutionary tracks , radiation transfer simulations are performed at selected stages , with temperature profiles , spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and multi - wavelength images produced . at a given stage , envelope temperature is depends strongly on @xmath1 , with higher temperatures in a higher @xmath1 core , but only weakly on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the sed and mir images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity , which gradually widens as the protostar grows . the fluxes at @xmath8 m increase dramatically , and the far - ir peaks move to shorter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( which determines disk size ) are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , despite scatter caused by different @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and inclinations , sources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions of color - color diagrams , especially when using colors with fluxes at @xmath9 m , where scatter due to inclination is minimized , implying that such diagrams can be useful diagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how intensity profiles along or perpendicular to the outflow axis are affected by environmental conditions and source evolution , and can thus act as additional diagnostics of the massive star formation process . </S>"
