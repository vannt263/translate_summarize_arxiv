    "evidence for the process which formed our galaxy is found throughout our galaxy s halo as trails of stars and gas ( e.g. yanny et al .",
    "2003 ; putman et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter p03 ) .",
    "these galactic building blocks are currently accreting satellites , and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( hereafter sgr dwarf ) is one of the closest examples of this process ( ibata et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the evidence continues to accumulate that contiguous streams of leading and trailing stellar debris are being pulled from the sgr dwarf as it spirals into the milky way ( e.g. newberg et al .",
    "2003 ; majewski et al . 2003 ; hereafter m03 ) .",
    "the stars associated with the sgr dwarf span a wide range of ages , with the youngest population between 0.5 - 2 gyr old ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ; dolphin 2002 ; m03 ) .",
    "this indicates that within the past gyr , the sgr dwarf was forming stars and had a source of star formation fuel .",
    "neutral hydrogen is a principal source of star formation fuel for a galaxy .",
    "galaxies which contain hi are commonly currently forming stars ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "2002 ; meurer et al .",
    "2003 ) and those without detectable hi tend to have primarily an older stellar population and thus appear to have exhausted their star formation fuel ( e.g. , gavazzi et al .",
    "this is evident in the dwarf galaxies of the local group .",
    "the stars in the local group dwarfs vary from being almost entirely ancient ( @xmath3 10 gyr ; e.g. , ursa minor ) to a number of systems which are actively forming stars ( e.g. wlm , phoenix , lmc ) .",
    "the hi content of the dwarfs is summarized by mateo ( 1998 ) , grebel , gallagher , & harbeck ( 2003 ) , and bouchard et al .",
    "the majority of the local group galaxies with hi have formed stars within the past 2 gyr and those with no evidence for recent star formation do not contain detectable hi ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ; dolphin 2002 )",
    ".    pointed hi observations of the central region of the sgr dwarf ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 19@xmath6 00@xmath7 , -30  25  ( j2000 ) ; @xmath86 , -15 ) indicate that our closest satellite galaxy does not currently contain a significant amount of star formation fuel (  @xmath9  ( 3@xmath10 ) ; koribalski , johnston & otrupcek 1994 ) .",
    "the search for hi associated with the sgr dwarf was continued by burton & lockman ( 1999 ) ; but they also found no associated gas over 18 deg@xmath11 between @xmath12  to -18.5  with limits of  @xmath13  ( 3@xmath10 ) .",
    "these results are surprising considering the sgr dwarf was forming stars within the last gyr .",
    "since the orbit of the sgr dwarf is approximately 0.7 gyr ( ibata & lewis 1998 ) , one might expect to find this fuel stripped along the dwarfs orbit , possibly at a similar location to the stellar trail .",
    "the trailing stellar tidal tail of the sgr dwarf has recently been found to extend for over 150  across the south galactic hemisphere with a mean distance between 20 to 40 kpc from the sun ( m03 ) .",
    "here we present hi data from hipass ( hi parkes all - sky survey ) along the entire sgr dwarf galaxy orbit to investigate the possibility that a gaseous sgr trail is also present .",
    "the gas detected represents a potential method of tracing the history , make - up , and classification of the sgr dwarf galaxy , as well as the construction of our galaxy .",
    "the neutral hydrogen data are from the  parkes all  sky survey ( hipass ) reduced with the minmed5 method ( p03 ) .",
    "hipass is a survey for  in the southern sky , extending from the south celestial pole to decl .",
    "@xmath14 , over velocities from @xmath15 to @xmath16 km s@xmath17 ( barnes et al .",
    "the survey utilized the 64m parkes radio telescope , with a focal  plane array of 13 beams arranged in a hexagonal grid , to scan the sky in @xmath18 zones of decl . with nyquist sampling .",
    "the minmed5 reduced hipass data has a spatial resolution of 15.5  and a spectral resolution , after hanning smoothing , of 26.4 km s@xmath17 .",
    "the survey was completed with a repetitive scanning procedure which provides source confirmation , mitigates diurnal influences , and aids interference excision . for extended sources ,",
    "the rms noise is 10 mjy beam@xmath17 ( beam area 243 arcmin@xmath11 ) , corresponding to a brightness temperature sensitivity of 8 mk .",
    "the northern extension of the survey , from @xmath19to @xmath20 , was only recently completed and is presented for the first time here .",
    "the noise in these cubes is slightly elevated compared to the southern data ( 11 mk vs. 8 mk ) .",
    "this may be due to a combination of low zenith angles during these observations and an inability to avoid solar interference as effectively .",
    "integrated intensity maps of the high positive and negative velocity gas ( generally @xmath21v@xmath22 , as long as the gas was clearly separate from galactic emission ) were made for the 24 deg@xmath11 cubes which lie along the sgr orbit .",
    "the positive velocity cubes had very little emission in them , so we concentrated on the negative velocity cubes .",
    "the noise at the edges of the negative velocity maps were blanked within aips and the images were then read into idl to create the map of the entire orbit shown in figure 1 . at 20 - 40",
    "kpc the minmed5 reduced hipass data has a sensitivity to clouds of gas with  @xmath23  ( @xmath24v = 25 ; 3@xmath10 ) .",
    "the large scale hi map which includes all of the high negative velocity gas along the orbit of the sgr dwarf is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this plot is in celestial coordinates as it depicts the main features found along the orbit better than galactic coordinates .",
    "the galactic plane , the orbit of the sgr dwarf ( ibata & lewis 1998 ) , and the current position of the sgr dwarf are shown .",
    "the stream of m giants presented by m03 has quite a broad width ( commonly several degrees ) along this orbit .",
    "the orbit of the sgr dwarf crosses the galactic plane at @xmath25  and @xmath26  which corresponds to approximately ( @xmath27)@xmath28 , 25   and 18@xmath6 , -30 , respectively . at the galactic center high negative and positive velocity gas",
    "is present , thus we have labeled the negative velocity hi emission within @xmath29 5  of the galactic plane at that location .",
    "the sgr orbit crosses the magellanic stream ( labeled ) at the south galactic pole or ( @xmath27)@xmath30 , -15 .",
    "the majority of the sgr dwarf orbit does not have both stars and hi gas at high negative velocities , with the exception of the hi gas between @xmath31 h and @xmath32 , or @xmath33  and @xmath34 .",
    "a close up of the velocity distribution of these hi clouds in galactic coordinates is shown in the channel maps of figure 2 .",
    "the m giants of the sgr stellar stream fill a large percentage of the region shown fig .",
    "this high velocity hi gas was previously identified as part of the anticenter complexes ( achv and acvhv ; wakker & van woerden 1991 ) and was discovered almost 40 years ago ( e.g. , mathewson et al .",
    "1966 ) , but its relationship to the sgr dwarf was not previously noted .",
    "there are some small negative velocity clouds along the sgr dwarf orbit , but besides the labeled gas in fig .",
    "1 , the only other substantial complex of negative velocity gas along the orbit of the sgr dwarf is in a region which has predominantly positive velocity stars ( ibata et al .",
    "this is the group of high - velocity clouds known as complex l at @xmath35 15.25 h , @xmath36 -19.5 .",
    "the amount of high positive velocity gas along the orbit of the sgr dwarf is very limited , and not correlated with the position of the positive velocity stars along the sgr stellar stream .",
    "figure 2 shows the gas along the orbit of the sgr dwarf between @xmath37 h and @xmath38   in galactic coordinates over the velocity range of -380 to -85  ( lsr ) . the emission extending from -380 to -180  at @xmath39is orientated along the orbit of the sgr dwarf and is completely isolated from gas which merges with lower velocity emission .",
    "this complex of gas would amount to m@xmath40  at 36 kpc , the approximate distance to the stars in the sgr stream .",
    "other emission which appears in the channel maps include a distinct filament beginning at @xmath41  in the velocity range of -245 to -75  that would have a mass of @xmath42  at 36 kpc .",
    "the gas in both complexes has peak column densities on the order of @xmath43 @xmath44 at the 15.5  resolution of hipass and extends to the column density limits of the data ( @xmath45 @xmath44 ; @xmath24v @xmath46 ) .",
    "there is also a population of clouds appearing at -125  that merge into intermediate velocity emission and are not included in figure 1 for this reason .",
    "the distance of 36 kpc was adopted based on the continuous stellar trail presented in m03 at those distances and the matching distance of a population of carbon stars ( ibata et al .",
    "the carbon stars associated with the sgr dwarf at this position have velocities between -140 to -160  ( lsr ; dinescu et al .",
    "2002 ; totten & irwin 1998 ; green et al .",
    "the present orbit of the sgr dwarf is estimated to be 0.7 gyr ( ibata & lewis 1998 ) . using this orbit ,",
    "the core of the sgr dwarf was at the position of the hi complex presented here approximately 0.2 - 0.3 gyr ago .",
    "it would make sense if the gas was part of the sgr dwarf 0.3 - 0.7 gyr ago considering the age of part of the sgr dwarf stellar population ( 0.5 - 2 gyr ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ; dolphin 2002 ; m03 ) .",
    "not surprisingly star formation surveys find that those galaxies which are actively forming stars also contain substantial amounts of star formation fuel in the form of neutral hydrogen ( lee et al .",
    "2002 ( kiss ) ; meurer et al .",
    "2003 ( singg ) ) .",
    "this paper addresses the issue of when and how the star formation fuel of the sgr dwarf was stripped from the galaxy .",
    "the gas between -380 and -180  at @xmath47  in figure 2 is the gas we propose was most likely once part of the sgr dwarf , as it follows the orbit of the sgr dwarf and is completely isolated from lower velocity emission that may have a relation to disk gas ( e.g. , tamanaha 1995 ) .",
    "this gas lies at a position where the sgr dwarf would have passed through the extreme edge of the galactic disk , and at this position the sgr dwarf stellar debris is approximately 40 @xmath48 50 kpc from the galactic center ( m03 ) .",
    "we have adopted 45 kpc as the typical distance from the galactic center at the position of the bulk of the gas .",
    "this distance is significantly beyond the typical radius quoted for our galaxy ( @xmath4926 kpc ) , however it is possible that an extended ionized disk exists for our galaxy ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "2003 ) , as found in other systems ( maloney 1993 ; bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997 ; steidel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the passage through an extended disk of our galaxy , in addition to the tidal forces already obviously at work as evident from the stellar tidal stream , might have been enough to disrupt the hi in the core of the galaxy and cause the dwarf to lose all remaining star formation fuel .",
    "the gas will be stripped from a galaxy if @xmath50 ( mori & burkert 2000 ; gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "we can use this equation to estimate the density needed at the edge of the disk to strip the gas from the core of the sgr dwarf .",
    "we use a tangential velocity of 280  for the sgr dwarf and a velocity dispersion of 11.4  ( ibata et al . 2003 ; ibata & lewis 1998 ) .",
    "if the column densities and size of the hi distribution in the core of the sgr dwarf were on the order of @xmath51 @xmath44 ( averaged over the core ) and 1 kpc , the typical @xmath52 is 0.16 @xmath2 .",
    "an extended disk density greater than @xmath53 @xmath2 is then needed to strip the gas via ram pressure stripping .",
    "based on previous estimates of the density of the galactic halo , this density would be easily achieved in the plane of galaxy , 20 kpc from the currently observed edge of the disk .",
    "examples of estimates for the density of the galactic halo which are consistent with @xmath54 @xmath2 at distances of 50 kpc and more include : explaining the existence of head - tail clouds which can be associated with the magellanic stream ( quilis & moore 2001 ) ; the confinement of the tip of the magellanic stream ( stanimirovic et al . 2002 ) ; the o vi high - velocity absorption line results ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) ; and the diffuse x - ray emission ( wang & mccray 1993 ) and dispersion measures for lmc pulsars ( taylor , manchester & lyne 1993 ) when the ionized medium is extended over @xmath49100 kpc .    stripping gas from a galactic satellite by passing it through the edge of the galaxy s disk was proposed as a possible solution for the origin of the magellanic stream by moore & davis ( 1994 ; hereafter md94 ) .",
    "they invoked an extended ionized disk at 65 kpc from the galactic center with column densities @xmath55 @xmath44 to strip gas from the satellite galaxy .",
    "the stripped gas initially has its speed reduced , but the decelerated gas falls to a lower orbit and subsequently attains a higher angular velocity . in order to reproduce the properties and distribution of the magellanic stream , md94 induce a braking effect on the gas with a diffuse medium in the halo , preventing it from rapidly falling into the galactic potential .",
    "though the hi trail of the sgr dwarf has a very different structure from the magellanic stream , parallels can be made between the md94 model and the stripping of the sgr hi clouds .",
    "both of the systems have similar impact velocities and have gas at similar distances from their cores ( roughly 50 - 60 kpc ) with similar column densities and velocities .",
    "the gas along the sgr dwarf orbit has slightly higher negative velocities than the carbon stars with velocity determinations in this region and this may be due to the gas falling into a slightly lower orbit than the stars . the exact predicted position and velocity of the gas relative to the stars will be addressed in a future simulation paper .    at 36 kpc from the sun the hi gas between -380 and -180  at @xmath47has a mass of @xmath56 .",
    "if the filament extending from @xmath57 to @xmath58  and v@xmath59 to @xmath60 is included as once being part of the sgr dwarf , the total hi mass goes up to @xmath61 . a typical total",
    "hi mass for a dwarf galaxy is on the order of @xmath62  ( grebel et al .",
    "2003 ) , so @xmath63  of gas originally being associated with the dwarf is certainly plausible and may represent anywhere from the majority to 10% of the sgr dwarf s original hi mass .",
    "using a total sgr dwarf mass of @xmath64  ( m03 ) , this gas represents 1 - 2% of its total mass .",
    "the sgr dwarf most likely originally had more than @xmath63  of neutral hydrogen associated with it , as the outer gaseous component would have been the first thing stripped ( e.g. , mihos 2001 ; yoshizawa & noguchi 2003 ) .",
    "this outer gas would have had column densities between @xmath65 @xmath44 and has most likely either already dispersed or been ionized , although remnants of this gas may be present as small hvcs along the sgr dwarf orbit . since there is currently no hi associated with the core of the sgr dwarf ( koribalski et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the dwarf has stars which are 0.5 - 2 gyr old , the hi gas presented here most likely represents the high column density gas from the core of the sgr dwarf which was finally stripped when the dwarf passed through the higher density medium in the extended galactic disk .",
    "this is supported by the relatively high peak column densities of the hi gas currently ( @xmath66 @xmath44 ) . for the sgr",
    "hi gas to survive for 0.2 - 0.3 gyr ( the time since the last passage of the core sgr dwarf ) , not to mention the magellanic stream which is thought to be @xmath3 0.5 gyr old , the gas should either be confined by an existing halo medium or associated with significant amounts of dark matter .",
    "our galaxy s halo is made up of numerous streams of satellite debris which trace its formation .",
    "the association of hi gas with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy emphasizes the number of dynamical processes occuring within the galactic halo . in this paper",
    "we find @xmath0  of hi gas along the orbit of the sgr dwarf .",
    "this is approximately 1 - 2% of the total mass of the dwarf , 10 - 20 times lower than the hi mass of the magellanic stream , and approximately the same hi mass as the leading arm of the magellanic system ( p03 ) .",
    "we argue this hi was the last gas stripped from the core of the sgr dwarf @xmath67 - 0.3 gyr ago due to its passage through the extended galactic disk with densities @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "this is supported by the agreement in the spatial distribution of the gas and stars along the sgr orbit , both components having high negative velocities , the location of the gas relative to the plane of our galaxy , the relatively high column densities of the hi gas , and the star formation history of the sgr dwarf .",
    "the association of hi gas with the sgr stellar stream suggests that the dwarf spheroidal classification for the sagittarius galaxy may need to be reconsidered .",
    "it also suggests that slightly offset hi and stellar streams may be a common feature of disrupted satellites in the galactic halo . with the accretion of this sgr hi stream ,",
    "the magellanic stream ( p03 ) , complex c ( wakker et al . 1999 ) , and possibly other hvcs , there is ample fuel for our galaxy s continuing star formation and understanding the distribution of stellar metallicities ( e.g. , the g - dwarf problem is not a problem ) . determining the metallicity , distance , and ionization properties of the hi gas presented here will aid in confirming if this hi gas was indeed stripped from the sgr dwarf during its current orbit .",
    "since we propose this is the last gas from the core of the sgr dwarf , we will also look for molecular gas and dust associated with these clouds .",
    "a future simulation paper will address the exact spatial and velocity distribution expected for gas stripped from the sgr dwarf .",
