    "the mean should approach zero if the estimation is unbiased , and the standard error should become one if the error bar is appropriately estimated . while the bias of the optimal fit becomes smaller as temperature decreases , the standard error is significantly large as shown in the table .",
    "it is because the correlation between data at different imaginary times is ignored and the estimated error bar is improperly too small .",

    "it would take a few hours for large system sizes with large number of data since the needed data points ( @xmath94 ) will be proportional to the system length in critical phases .",
    "on the other hand , it is much easier , in our approach , to calculate a valid error bar simply by the first - order jackknife method@xcite that costs only @xmath244 .",
    "our approach is , thus , more accurate than simple ( or naive ) fitting methods like the optimal fit as we showed , and also handier and more straightforward than the bootstrapping .",
    "we will discuss the variance of the gap estimators  ( [ eqn : delta - n ] ) and the feasibility of our approach . because the distribution of an average of monte carlo samples will be gaussian according to the central limit theorem",
    ", the estimator @xmath245 takes the form of the ratio between the two gaussian distributions .",

    "a typical value of @xmath120 in the present paper can be estimated around @xmath261@xmath262 .",

    ", it rapidly grows as @xmath79 for @xmath264 .",
    "therefore the higher gap estimators work only for @xmath265 .",
    "next let us estimate the value of needed @xmath266 ( or @xmath103 ) so that @xmath267 is close enough to 1 .",

    "the consistency can be checked by @xmath290 .",
    "( ii ) set temperature @xmath291 , equivalently @xmath292 .",
    "( iii ) calculate the higher - order gap estimate @xmath293 with @xmath294 as the final gap estimation .",
    "then the ( relative ) systematic and statistical error can become as small as @xmath295@xmath296 .",
    "note that the actual statistical error is @xmath297 , where @xmath240 is the number of monte carlo steps , so @xmath240 naturally needs to be @xmath298@xmath299 to achieve the precision .",
    "the important points here are the systematic error is securely smaller than an achievable statistical error and the total of the systematic and statistical errors will be actually reduced to such a small number .",
    "this recipe indeed works for the test case in the main text , where the higher - order gap estimate converges well at @xmath300 , equivalently @xmath301 , as shown in fig .",
