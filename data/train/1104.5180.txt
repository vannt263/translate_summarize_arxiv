    "nonequilibrium measurements on biological macromolecules , such as mechanical force - induced unfolding @xcite and flow - based analogs @xcite , have emerged as a powerful complement to equilibrium studies .",
    "indeed , it now possible to follow the evolution of distances through fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) simultaneously with forces through optical traps @xcite . while these measurements provide unprecedented experimental data on the stochastic dynamics of individual molecules , they still only probe at most a few degrees of freedom among many .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations , which provide complete information about the positions of all participating particles subject to the assumptions of the model , have proven to be a valuable tool for interpreting these data @xcite .",
    "however , the time scales for conformational change are often long compared with elementary fluctuations , which makes waiting for the events of interest to occur spontaneously under conditions representative of experimental ones prohibitively computationally costly . to accelerate convergence , many simulation studies employ unrealistically extreme nonequilibrium conditions ( see discussion in hu _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , enhanced sampling methods can be used to improve exploration of phase space and focus computational effort on low probability regions of mechanistic importance , such as transition states .",
    "the most widespread such methods @xcite rely on the fact that the statistics of equilibrium systems are known _ a priori _ , which prevents the applicability of such methods to nonequilibrium situations .",
    "however , there now exist methods that can enhance the sampling of low probability regions without relying on equilibrium properties of the system @xcite . although these methods differ in detail , the essential idea in all of them is to harvest segments of unbiased dynamics trajectories such as to achieve relatively uniform sampling of different regions of a space of physically relevant degrees of freedom ( order parameters ) .",
    "the acceleration of convergence follows from the fact that each trajectory segment need only traverse a small portion of the space of order parameters , across which the probability is relatively uniform .",
    "we have been developing one such method : nonequilibrium umbrella sampling ( neus ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a streamlined version of the algorithm with improved convergence properties . the most significant change is the explicit association of a weight with each saved copy of the system , motivated by the weighted ensemble method @xcite .",
    "the fact that many trajectory segments are integrated independently makes the method highly parallelizable , and we detail and implement a strategy that can provide excellent scaling to large numbers of processors .",
    "we use the method to simulate partial unfolding and refolding of a coarse - grained model of a 262-nucleotide rna molecule in the presence of a flow field .",
    "our interest in this system comes from single - molecule studies of fret between probes on the l18 loop and 3@xmath1 terminus of the catalytic domain of the rnase p rna from _ bacillus stearothermophilus _ @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the molecule was tethered in a microfluidic channel to enable relatively rapid changes in magnesium ion concentration , and this led to the question of whether flow contributed to the dynamics observed @xcite . here",
    ", we show that there are two competing unfolding pathways , the likelihoods of which depend on the rate of flow of the solution .",
    "we compare these results with reversible unfolding simulations ( without a net flow ) .",
    "as we show , the events of interest are on the time scale of milliseconds to seconds , while straightforward simulations of the coarse - grained model are limited to tens of microseconds .",
    "thus enhanced sampling is needed . here",
    ", we describe the version of nonequilibrium umbrella sampling ( neus ) @xcite used in the present study . to this end",
    ", we summarize the overall strategy , and then we describe the phases of the simulation and parallelization ; differences from earlier versions of the algorithm and competing methods are noted .",
    "the sampling is guided by a set of physically relevant variables ( `` order parameters '' ) .",
    "ideally , these order parameters will describe the slow dynamics in the system , and the remaining degrees of freedom will relax relatively fast . in this work",
    ", we employ a single order - parameter that quantifies the total number of intramolecular contacts ( section [ sec : system ] ) . however , we explicitly separate the `` forward '' ( unfolding ) and `` backward '' ( refolding ) transition path ensembles as in dickson _ et al .",
    "this allows the sampling of the orthogonal degrees of freedom to differ between the two ensembles ( i.e. , allows for separate unfolding and refolding pathways ) , and it enables the calculation of transition rates between basins .    for the simulations , we divide the space of order parameters into regions , which need not be uniform in size .",
    "each region contains one or more copies of the system ( walkers ) that evolve independently according to the natural dynamics of the system , and we associate with that copy a weight for contributing to averages .",
    "when a copy of the system attempts to leave its region , the configuration is saved to a list of entry points for the neighboring region , along with the weight of the copy . when a neighboring list is full , the oldest saved configuration is overwritten and its weight is distributed over the remaining points in the list in a manner that does not affect their relative probabilities of being chosen",
    "the copy is then restarted from a saved configuration , @xmath2 , which is chosen from one of its region s lists with likelihood proportional to its weight ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the weight of this point is then partitioned between the active and saved copies : @xmath4 ( @xmath5 $ ] ) is given to the active copy , and the rest , @xmath6 , remains associated with the saved entry point .",
    "note that @xmath7 results in straightforward dynamics , or a single , continuous trajectory .",
    "here we use @xmath8 .",
    "the incorporation of this feature in the neus algorithm is motivated by the ( equal ) partitioning of the probability when a trajectory branches in the weighted ensemble ( we ) method @xcite ; it ensures conservation of the starting probability and suppresses artificial amplification of particular trajectories . as a result , we are able to obtain converged results with only one set ( lattice ) of regions in the extended space as opposed to two as in previous work @xcite .",
    "a common situation is that one is interested in studying a transition between two or more states but one knows the configuration of the system in only one of the stable states .",
    "this situation applies here to the rna - under - flow system , since we know the folded configuration but not the most likely unfolded configurations .",
    "although in principle one could start the simulation in each region using any configuration consistent with the allowed order parameter values , in practice it is best to start with a distribution of structures that is as consistent as possible with the physically weighted dynamics to avoid introducing unnecessary errors that take time to be corrected . to this end , we progressively activate the regions in a manner similar to forward flux sampling ( ffs ) @xcite as follows .",
    "we start by running an unconstrained simulation that is initialized in the known stable configuration . during this simulation ,",
    "we record the configuration each time the system crosses a boundary of a region but do not reset the configuration .",
    "these configurations serve as the initial entry ( i.e. , resetting ) points for the regions visited , and all such configurations are assigned equal weight . following the unconstrained simulation , we begin the umbrella sampling simulation starting from saved entry points in each region that has at least one such point , employing and updating the copy weights as described above .",
    "regions that were not visited previously are activated once entry points for them are obtained .",
    "as the simulations proceed , regions of lower and lower probability are activated by their neighbors , and trajectories emerge from the original stable state . once all the regions are activated , we are able to concurrently sample the entire order parameter space of interest , using only points that resulted directly from the starting distribution .    in the present study ,",
    "the progressive initialization of regions accounts for about 2% of the total simulation time .",
    "the sampling procedure employed here further differs from ffs in that it does not explicitly require a notion of forward progress and thus can be used with sampling regions that are defined by an arbitrary number of order parameters . by the same token , trajectories are terminated when they cross any boundary , not only a forward one .",
    "this distinction is of practical importance when the dynamics do not lead rapidly back to the starting basin ( see dickson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "the algorithm as described is in principle complete .",
    "indeed , it is very similar to the we method except that ( i ) it permits strict control of the number of copies in a region ( including only limiting it to one ) and ( ii ) differs in the details of weight partitioning when resetting ( branching ) and redistributing when overwriting ( pruning ) .",
    "however , the transfer of weight between regions of high probability can be very slow when the weight must pass through a bottleneck region of low probability .",
    "this is because a very large number of low probability walkers are required to add up to a significant change of weight in a high probability region .",
    "this convergence issue arises despite the fact that the time for initial exploration of the space decreases with increases in the number of regions , as in any umbrella sampling procedure @xcite .    to accelerate convergence after the initialization phase",
    ", we periodically use the interface - to - interface crossing statistics to predict statistical weights for each region ( @xmath9 ) , and scale the weights of the entry points in each region , @xmath2 , such that their sum is equal to @xmath10 . here",
    ", the weights are obtained from a modified version of the scheme in vanden - eijnden and venturoli @xcite , where the total flux into a region is set equal to the total flux out of a region . to this end , we accumulate a transition matrix , @xmath11 : each off - diagonal element @xmath12 is the number of transitions observed from region @xmath13 to region @xmath2 in the last weight update period , and each diagonal element @xmath14 .",
    "we then solve the equation @xmath15 for the weight vector @xmath16 by using singular value decomposition to compute the nullspace of @xmath11 , which is the single nontrivial solution @xmath16 . here",
    ", we perform this operation periodically throughout the simulation , as in previous neus studies @xcite ; this contrasts with the study by bhatt _",
    "et al_. @xcite in which a single such step is used to pre - condition the simulation and then flux balance is used to check convergence .",
    "the simulations of the copies of the system require only limited communication .",
    "as such , neus and methods like it lend themselves well to parallelization . however , we find that they benefit from careful implementation on high performance computers .",
    "all simulations for the present study are run on parallel architectures using the global arrays toolkit @xcite , which implements a global address space programming model in which processes can access remote data using one - sided communication .",
    "one - sided communication is particularly useful in this case , since the timing of boundary crossing events is not predictable .",
    "the global address space also enables one to distribute the storage of a large set of region entry points across the memory of many compute nodes .",
    "the entry points for each region , the region weights , boundary crossing statistics and sampling histogram data are all stored as global arrays .",
    "these arrays can be modified by any process using `` put '' functions and `` get '' functions , where locks are used to enable atomic updates of global data ( modifications of the entry point lists , for instance ) that prevent processes from concurrently accessing the same region of a global array .",
    "although the dynamics of the copies are simulated essentially without communication once they are initialized , neus still periodically requires some collective operations , such as weight updates , and the computation of rates and probability distributions . to allow for such operations",
    ", we break down the simulation into `` cycles '' of computation , at the end of which all processes are synchronized . within the cycles ,",
    "the work is distributed among the processes as follows . when a process is finished running a trajectory segment ,",
    "it queries how many steps have been run in each region @xmath17 so far this cycle ( @xmath18 ) , and it uses the results to decide in which region to run the next trajectory segment . specifically , it chooses to start a trajectory in region @xmath13 with probability @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of steps to be run in each region per cycle .",
    "a trajectory is run until either the counter in its region reaches @xmath20 ( upon which the current configuration of the system is saved to the entry point list as a simple means of maintaining it ) , and a computational cycle ends when all counters reach @xmath20 .      the system is a model of the catalytic domain of rnase p rna from _",
    "bacillus stearothermophilus_. to make the simulations tractable , we use a coarse - grained representation that averages over the atomic structure and dynamics , while taking into account the secondary and tertiary interactions that stablize the native state : the self - organized polymer ( sop ) model @xcite . in the sop model ,",
    "each nucleotide of the rna is treated as a bead , and the beads interact through potentials that depend on the known native structure .",
    "the potential defining the model is the sum of a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential that connects adjacent beads @xcite ( @xmath21 ) ; a lennard - jones attraction between beads that has a minimum at the native structure distance ( @xmath22 ) ; pairwise non - bonded repulsions scaling as @xmath23 , which locally straighten the chain and mimic steric repulsions between nucleotides ( @xmath24 ) ; and a weeks - chandler - andersen @xcite ( wca ) repulsion between each bead and the wall at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "@xcite , the two sets of regions can be seen as a single set of nonoverlapping regions in an extended space , and transition rates between the basins can be obtained by calculating fluxes in this extended space .      in the simulations presented here , the saved entry point lists for each region",

    "we found it unnecessary to store the coordinates of the solvent along with the flux input point , since the solvent relaxes almost instantaneously to the presence of the polymer ( data not shown ) , as there are no steric interactions between the polymer and solvent .    in the work below , a cycle constitutes 2000 rna time steps in each active sampling region .",

    "these trajectories were run using @xmath110 , and `` unfolding '' was defined as reaching @xmath127 contacts instead of the usual @xmath128 for path e , in order to increase the probability of observing an unfolding event .",
    "using neus we found the mfpt for this process was @xmath134 ms , making the length of the straightforward trajectories 12.5% of the predicted mfpt , and no unfolding events were observed .",
    "these simulations required 30 days of computation on 16 2.5 ghz intel xeon processors .",
    "this also emphasizes the computational benefit of parallelization , as the @xmath135 steps for the largest umbrella sampling simulations were completed in @xmath136 h of computation on 64 processors .",
    "however , even if a similar parallelization scheme using 64 processors was employed for straightforward trajectories , it would still take an average of 58 years of computer time to observe a single path e unfolding trajectory for @xmath111 , and many times that to observe an ensemble of unfolding events .",
    "here we have presented a parallel version of neus and applied it to a coarse - grained macromolecular system driven far from equilibrium by flow .",
    "we obtained folding and unfolding rates and mechanisms for a range of flow speeds .",
    "this range was chosen to be physically reasonable yet result in significant flow effects .",
    "it is large compared to @xmath137 , the pclet number of the flow used to change the magnesium ion concentrations in the rnase p rna single molecule experiments of qu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and our simulations suggest that flow did not contribute to the dynamics discussed in @xcite , at least at moderately high magnesium ion concentrations , which strongly favor the folded state .",
    "a lack of knowledge of the structure of the rna at low magnesium ion concentrations prevents us from assessing that situation .    due to the stability of the native state ,",
    "unfolding transitions were extremely slow , occurring as slowly as once in every @xmath0 dynamics steps , or every @xmath138 s in real time .",
    "we observed two different unfolding pathways , one where secondary contacts were broken in the p1 loop , and another where contacts were broken in and around the p5 loop , which is near the tethered endpoint .",
    "we defined unfolded and folded states using an order parameter that measures the number of native contacts .",
    "if one were to use more than one order parameter , sampling could be enforced separately along these two pathways .",
    "this would allow for a more precise description of the competition between the two pathways for a given flow rate , and a description of the transition between the pathways of maximum probability as the flow rate changes .",
    "work is currently underway to acheive this goal . the parallelization strategy presented here for piecewise sampling methods will enable treatment of increasingly complex order parameter spaces as large - scale computational architectures continue to grow in size .",
    "we would like to thank nicholas guttenberg and jonathan weare for useful discussions on the algorithm , and glenna smith and norbert scherer for help with the rna model .",
