    "such contribution is of a radically different kind with respect to the listed above because contributions from both sides of a slow confinement potential compensate each other @xcite and , therefore , the spin - splitting of 2d states can not be obtained without a short - range potential contribution . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "the effect of in - plane magnetic field on the energy spectrum in non - symmetric heterostructures occurs due to the zeeman term in the electron hamiltonian .",

    "all this papers only take into account the mix between the zeeman contribution and the effective 2d spin - orbit interaction .",
