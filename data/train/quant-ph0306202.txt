    "nowadays , the coherent state has found widespread application in many branches of physics such as non linear optics , laser , nuclear and particle physics . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "the coherent states are well known and one can produce them using three different ways @xcite :    * _ they can be constructed as eigenstates of the annihilation operator . _ * _ they can be defined as quantum states with minimum uncertainty relationship .",
    "_ * _ they can be obtained by operating the glauber s displacement operator on the vacuum state .",
    "_    the above definitions are known to be equivalent for the schrdinger equation with the harmonic - oscillator potential . in references [ 2 - 12 ]",
    "coherent states for systems other than the harmonic - oscillator are also investigated .    to extend the _ coherence _ to relativistic region one may use manifestly covariant equations @xcite .",
    "of course in this way , it is difficult to describe the wave functions in terms of four vectors .",
    "thus , in many areas of physics , one may use the schrdinger equation with relativistic corrections or the klein - gordon ( kg ) or dirac equation with specific potentials to describe a relativistic particle or even bound state in a non - covariance manner . to describe the relativistic coherent states using the kg or dirac equation",
    "one encounters particle pair creation that makes one particle interpretation nonsense . to avoid this problem one should consider the theory under conditions that the pair creation is impossible .",
    "furthermore in relativistic quantum mechanics the consistency of the one particle description is limited and in this case the only valid operators are _ even _ operators which do not mix different charge states . in this",
    "direction authors of reference @xcite have studied a spin 0 charged particle in two cases : free particle and a particle in a constant homogeneous magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we examine the possibility of coherence for kg equation with a pure scalar potential and adopt the definition @xmath0 to extend the coherence to the relativistic region .",
    "such a potential describes a position dependent valence and conduction - band edge of semiconductors near the @xmath1 or @xmath2 point in the brillouin zone .",
    "in fact the position dependent mass characterizes a position dependent band gap .",
    "examples for such materials are given in ref .",
    "+ in section 2 we obtain @xmath3 and @xmath4 operators in the feshbach - villars representation for a general scalar potential .",
    "subsequently we derive eigensolutions of a linear scalar potential in the schrdinger representation to show that pair creation does not occur .",
    "consequently we construct the eigenstates of the annihilation operator for this potential .",
    "the time evolution of the states is numerically discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we introduce a potential with equally spaced energy levels and examine their coherence with time .",
    "the resolution of unity for the obtained states is also discussed in this section .",
    "in order to explore the coherence of a relativistic particle in the simplest case we consider the kg equation in one dimension with a vector and a scalar potential ( @xmath5)[15,16 ] @xmath6\\psi(x , t)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the mass of the particle , @xmath8 is the scalar potential and @xmath9 is the time component of a 4-vector potential . in non - relativistic limit ,",
    "eq.(1 ) leads to a schrdinger equation with an effective potential as @xmath10 .",
    "in fact this equation gives all relativistic corrections to the schrdinger equation with such an effective potential .",
    "for a pure scalar potential we have    @xmath11    in which @xmath12 now by introducing two functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the ansatz @xmath15 we transform eq.([kg1 ] ) to the schrdinger form as follows @xmath16\\psi , \\label{schkg}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , are the pauli matrices and @xmath19 is a two components column vector as @xmath20 it is easy to show that each component of @xmath19 individually satisfies the kg equation i.e. eq.([kg1 ] ) . if we define @xmath21 as eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath22 with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath23 with the ansatz @xmath24 } , \\label{ansa}\\ ] ] one obtains the positive and negative energy solutions as follows @xmath25 } , \\label{un}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the appropriate normalization constants and @xmath27 now an operator @xmath28 in which @xmath29 can transform the schrdinger representation to the feshbach - villars representation therefore it can be shown that the hamiltonian in this representation is @xmath30 which is even and the even parts of operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 are also the same as the corresponding operators in the non - relativistic region : @xmath31 for x - operator in momentum space and @xmath32 for p - operator in configuration space .",
    "now we are ready to study the coherent states for potentials without pair creation .",
    "first , we choose a linear potential as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a coupling constant . introducing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , by using the ansatz of eq.([ansa ] ) , eq.([kg1 ] )",
    "can be written in a familiar form -the schrdinger equation with a harmonic - oscillator potential",
    ". therefore one can easily find @xmath37},\\ ] ] in which @xmath38 is the hermite polynomial of order @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "one can easily see from eq.([hoe ] ) that pair creation in this case never occurs . for a pure scalar potential",
    "the kg equation is independent of the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "in fact the scalar interaction is independent of the charge of the particle and has the same effect on particles and anti - particles .",
    "thus , naively speaking , this kind of potential can describe the confining part of the potential of a quarkonium .    since the even part of an operator is a measurable quantity therefore eq.([xfv ] ) and eq.([pfv ] ) allow us to consider the usual annihilation operator for a non - relativistic harmonic oscillator potential to construct the coherent state for our linear potential .",
    "therefore the coherent state @xmath43 at t=0 in the feshbach - villars representation in terms of the energy eigenstate for a non - relativistic harmonic oscillator @xmath44 , can be obtained as @xmath45 for positive energy state and @xmath46 for negative energy state .",
    "thus the state given in eq.([alfa ] ) , when we restrict ourselves to the positive energy states , evolves as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "although @xmath43 is coherent , its time evolution is not the eigenstate of the annihilation operator .",
    "indeed , this is due to the non - equally - spaced of the energy levels given in eq.([hoe ] ) .",
    "+ one of the significant properties of the coherent states is an over completeness relation or resolution of unity as follows @xmath49 where the measure @xmath50 for the obtained states in this section ( i.e. eq.([alfa ] ) ) can be easily determined as @xmath51d[im \\alpha]\\over \\pi } .\\label{meas}\\ ] ]",
    "to explore the behavior of the solutions given in eq.([alfat ] ) we first , examine the expectation values of the appropriate quantities as follows @xmath52   } { |\\alpha|^{2n}\\over n!},\\ ] ] @xmath53   { |\\alpha|^{2n}\\over n!},\\ ] ] @xmath54 @xmath55 { |\\alpha|^{2n}\\over n!},\\ ] ] @xmath56 @xmath57 { |\\alpha|^{2n}\\over n!},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 time variations of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for various values of @xmath62 , are illustrated in figs.(1)-(11 ) .",
    "+    for @xmath63 the value of @xmath64 oscillates between 0.50 and 0.51 and the state is nearly coherent , fig.(1 ) .",
    "in contrast @xmath64 for @xmath65 increases with time though its value for long time is bounded and oscillates about a certain value , figs.(2 - 3 ) .",
    "+    the numerical values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in both cases are not constant as shown in figs.(4 - 7 ) . when @xmath66 they oscillate almost periodically about their minimum values .",
    "furthermore , their oscillations are exactly out of phase and the states are squeezed , figs.(4 - 5 ) .",
    "when @xmath62 increases to @xmath67 , the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 increase with time and finally oscillate about a finite value , figs.(6 - 7 ) .",
    "+ the expectation values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath66 and @xmath68 are plotted in figs.(8 - 9 ) and figs.(10 - 11 ) , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath66 the values @xmath69 and @xmath70 oscillate with an amplitude and a period nearly constant which is very similar to a classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "again for @xmath68 the situation is exactly different and the values of @xmath71 and @xmath70 oscillate with a variable period and amplitude .",
    "+ in the evaluation of the various quantities we have summed terms up to @xmath72 and assumed @xmath73 , though the general behaviors do not depend on @xmath34 .",
    "in the preceding section we saw that a relativistic scalar particle with a linear scalar potential , in general , is not coherent .",
    "the main reason for deviation from coherence is the fact that the eigenenergies are not equally spaced .",
    "now , we would like to construct potentials with equally - spaced energy levels .",
    "for this purpose we rewrite @xmath22 as follows @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "we now introduce a potential as follows @xmath76 in the region @xmath77 and is infinite elsewhere , or in the same region @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant . substituting this potential in eq.([kgpt ] ) and using ansatz ( [ ansa ] ) equation ( [ kg1 ] ) leads to the non - relativistic poschl - teller ( pt ) equation @xcite and consequently @xmath21 in eq.([un ] ) can be obtained as @xmath80^{1\\over 2 } ( \\cos\\omega x)^{1\\over 2}p_{n+\\lambda -{1\\over 2}}^{{1\\over 2}-\\lambda}(\\sin\\omega x)\\ ] ] and for the energy eigenvalues one has @xmath81 where @xmath82 it should be noted that although in the relativistic pt potential , eq.([pt1 ] ) , the energy levels are equally - spaced but the pt potential in the schrdinger equation has non - equally - spaced levels [ 3,4 ] . here again pair creation does not occur and one - particle sector of the theory is applicable .",
    "now we need the annihilation operators to construct the coherent states . to this end , one can use the schrdinger method to determine the ladder operators as follows @xcite : @xmath83^{1\\over2}\\mp { 1\\over \\omega}(\\cos\\omega x){d\\over dx}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the hamiltonian of the schrdinger equation for the pt potential .",
    "therefore in the feshbach - villars representation we have @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the wave function in the feshbach - villars representation @xmath87},\\ ] ] in which @xmath88 stands for positive and negative energy solutions , respectively , and @xmath89^{1\\over 2}.\\ ] ] let us now determine @xmath90 as the eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath91 , with eigenvalue @xmath62 , by using an expansion on the states @xmath92 : @xmath93 we then have @xmath94 therefore @xmath95^{1\\over 2}c_n,\\ ] ] and , finally @xmath96 can be obtained as @xmath97^{1\\over 2}{\\psi}^{fv}_n(t=0),\\label{alpt}\\ ] ] where @xmath98^{-{1\\over 2}},\\ ] ] and @xmath99 now we examine the evolution of @xmath96 at every instant .",
    "for this purpose we restrict ourselves to the positive energy states which implies @xmath100^{1\\over 2}e^{-ie_nt}{\\psi}^{fv}_n(t=0),\\label{alptt}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is given in eq.([pten ] ) . in this case since the eigenenergies are equally spaced one has @xmath102 where @xmath103 therefore , the coherent state wave packet remains an eigenvector of @xmath91 with an eigenvalue @xmath104 .",
    "now we investigate the resolution of unity for the obtained states . as ( [ alpt ] )",
    "shows the measure in this case is different from the standard form of ( [ meas ] ) but one can follow the method of references @xcite and @xcite to find @xmath105d[im \\alpha]\\over \\pi},\\label{measpt}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 can be determined by solving the following equation @xmath107",
    "to summarize , in the feshbach - villars representation we obtained @xmath3 and @xmath4 operators for a general scalar potential .",
    "the even parts of these operators coincide with their counterparts in the schrdinger representation , see eqs.([xfv],[pfv ] ) .",
    "consequently , we constructed the annihilation operator coherent state for a purely linear scalar potential for a relativistic spinless particle .",
    "the properties of these states in @xmath108 dimension are :    * the eigenfunctions for the small eigenvalues eq.([eigen ] ) are quasi - coherent and squeezed . furthermore @xmath71 and @xmath70 oscillate like a classical harmonic oscillator . in the other words for the small values of @xmath62 , which is not the non - relativistic limit of eq.([kg1 ] ) ,",
    "the states regain their coherence though the relativistic corrections destroy the coherence of harmonic potential in the non - relativistic schrdinger equation . *",
    "for both small and large eigenvalues the minimum uncertainties do not increase unbounded with time .",
    "in fact this means that wave packet does not spread unbounded . *",
    "the expectation values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for large @xmath62 oscillate with decreasing amplitude and approach zero which is equal to the values of @xmath71 and @xmath70 in the energy basis .",
    "we also introduced the relativistic poschl - teller potential and showed that its energy levels are equally - spaced , eqs.([pt1],[pten ] ) .",
    "we obtained the eigenfunctions of the annihilation operator for this potential , eq.([alpt ] ) .",
    "it is consequently shown that the time evolution of the obtained functions are still eigenstates of the annihilation operator , eq.([alptt ] ) . + * acknowledgment * the authors would like to thank b. ferdowsian for his contribution to this work at preliminary stage . financial support of isfahan university of technology and institute for studies in theoretical physics and mathematics ( ipm ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
