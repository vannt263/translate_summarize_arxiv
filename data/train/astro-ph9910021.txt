    "this feature is definitely real : it is seen in multiple subsets of our data at the same location and velocity .",

    "inward_.     figure [ f.h - chan ] ",
    "the size of the northwest stream in the high - resolution map is @xmath37 ( @xmath38 kpc ) , with its major axis running in an east - west direction . due to missing flux , this map may underestimate the feature s true extent  possibly closer to @xmath1 kpc as seen in the medium - resolution map .",

    "= @xmath42 ) of the dynamical center .",
    "the galactocentric radius of this centroid is 1.0kpc if the stream is moving in the galactic plane .",
    "the velocity gradient in the stream also runs from east to west with higher velocities to the east ; the total linewidth is roughly 100 .",
    "figure [ f.hst-l ] reveals that the northwest stream coincides with a dust lane observed optically .",
    "this lane lies to the west of the nucleus and runs from the nuclear disk in the east to the 3kpc ring in the west .",
    "the molecular gas of the northwest stream falls in the middle of the dust lane , where there is a dark feature in the optical image .",
    "the low - resolution maps ( figures [ f.maps ] and [ f.l - chan ] ) show a co ring at a radius of @xmath43 ( 3 kpc ) as in our previous observations . in these maps ,",
    "the 3kpc ring is now found to be nearly continuous , completely encircling the center with few gaps .",
    "the ring is nearly circular when deprojected , as seen from comparing it to the reference ellipse ( an appropriately projected circle ) in the maps .",
    "most of the ring emission lies within the annulus from 20   40  ( 2  4 kpc ) , although the outer boundary is uncertain because of the primary beam attenuation .",
    "the total mass of molecular gas in this annulus is @xmath44 .",
    "the mean and peak surface densities in this region are @xmath45  and @xmath46  respectively , after correction for inclination .",
    "the kinematics of the ring seen in the channel maps ( figure [ f.l - chan ] ) are intriguing .",
    "emission in each channel is _ not _ reflection - symmetric about the major axis of the galaxy ( i.e. the major axis of the ellipse ) .",
    "the asymmetry is such that the emission on the far / near ( i.e. se / nw ) side of the galaxy is consistently shifted towards the receding / approaching ( i.e. to the ne / sw ) side of the minor axis .",
    "this is most obviously seen at systemic velocity in the 938  channel .",
    "the emission centroids from the ring and the nucleus are indeed aligned , but the alignment differs by 30  from the galaxy s minor axis .",
    "attributing this offset to an error in the position angle determined from the galaxy s outer isophotes is unwise : it is hard to make an error as large as 30  given the large inclination and undisturbed morphology .",
    "the adopted isophotal position angle is also supported by the fact that the highest and lowest - velocity emission from the ring appears on the galaxy s major axis ( see the 658 , 689 , and 1218  channels in figure [ f.l - chan ] ) .",
    "the kinematic major axis of the nuclear disk has p.a .",
    "@xmath47 70 , also in close agreement with the isophotal major axis .",
    "we instead ascribe the asymmetries in the channel maps to systematic noncircular motions in the ring .",
    "on the minor axis , these motions appear inward , since the emission on the far / near side has lower / higher velocity than systemic .",
    "the consistency of the asymmetries from channel to channel suggests that the noncircular motion is systematic and exists across the ring , although it is not observable near the major axis .    in optical images ( figures [ f.int ] and [ f.hst-l ] )",
    ", the ring appears as a dark arc on the near side of the galaxy .",
    "a dark spiral lane clearly emerges from this part of the ring and winds to the southwest at larger radius .",
    "a counterpart to this spiral feature on the far side of the galaxy would be harder to see , but there are hints of optically bright patches emanating from the ring to the northeast .",
    "we do not detect co emission from the spiral arms located outside the ring .",
    "the contrast in surface density between the nuclear molecular disk and the surrounding region within the 3kpc ring is striking ; it is also similar to the gas morphology often seen in the nuclei of barred galaxies ( sakamoto  1999a ) . beyond its appearance ,",
    "the degree of central concentration in this galaxy is ( numerically ) one of the highest in the sakamoto  ( 1999b ) survey , whose results show that barred galaxies in general have higher degrees of gas concentration than their unbarred counterparts .",
    "we propose that ngc5005 contains a small bar within its 3kpc ring , which builds up the central gas condensation and is itself traced by the northwest stream .",
    "we locate this bar in a roughly east - west direction so that the northwest stream can be produced by a shock along the dust lane at its leading edge . the central depression in the nuclear disk",
    "may result from concentration of gas towards @xmath48 orbits at the inner 2:1 lindblad resonance of the bar , although it may also reflect outflow or a variation in excitation .",
    "the 3kpc ring likely arises at the end of the bar , due to gas accumulation in either an inner 4:1 lindblad resonance region or a pair of tightly wound spiral arms",
    ". a schematic view of our interpretation is shown in figure [ f.illust ] .",
    "we present below our detailed cases for the existence of the bar snapshot images from the palomar 60-inch telescope are consistent with a bar of length @xmath28 at a position angle of @xmath27 80 . ] and the origin of the 3kpc ring , along with a brief discussion of the role played by these structures in fueling the nucleus .",
    " figure [ f.illust ]       figure [ f.barpv ] shows a position - velocity cut at a position angle of 80 , roughly along the hypothesized bar .",
    "the cut is 5  wide and therefore includes the emission from the northwest stream .",
    "the p - v diagram shows two distinct kinematic components .",
    "the component with the steeper velocity gradient arises in the nuclear disk ; the component with the shallower gradient originates in the northwest stream [ at ( @xmath49 ) ] and parts of the 3kpc ring .",
    "the overall `` tilted x '' pattern is characteristic of p - v diagrams in models of bar - driven gas dynamics : each kinematic component corresponds to a major family of noncircular orbits supported by a barred potential .",
    "such patterns ( also described as `` figure - of - eight '' ) have been successfully used to infer the presence of bars in the galaxy ( binney  1991 ) and in edge - on external galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similar patterns have also been observed in a number of barred galaxies with moderate inclinations ( e.g. m83 : handa  1990 ; ngc 7479 : laine  1999 ; ugc 2855 : httemeister  1999 ) .    ",
    "figure [ f.barpv ]     figure [ f.barmodel ] presents a model of gas orbits in a barred potential which reproduces the main features in the position - velocity diagram for ngc5005 .",
    "we calculate periodic orbits using the damped - orbit model of wada ( 1994 ) and the formulae of sakamoto   ( 1999a : appendix b ) for the case in which two inner 2:1 lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) exist .",
    "we adopt a pattern speed for the bar which locates these resonances at radii of 1.1 and 2.1 ( in dimensionless units for which corotation occurs at 10.0 ) ; this choice is motivated by considerations which follow in  [ s.oring ] .",
    "the dominant orbits outside the outer ilr and inside the inner ilr are parallel to the bar and belong to the  family . between the ilrs , orbits which are perpendicular to the bar and belong to the  family",
    "dominate . in the left panel of figure [ f.barmodel ] ,",
    "the  orbits are horizontally elongated . at the ilrs ,",
    "the position angle of the orbits differs by 45  from the bar major axis because of a damping term in the model ( wada 1994 ; sanders & huntley 1976 ) .",
    "we note that the streamlines in a cloud - based model like this one can have sharp turns ( giving rise to large velocity widths ) at the leading edge of the bar ( e.g. lindblad & lindblad 1994 ) .",
    "such features have been attributed by other authors ( e.g. regan  1999 ) entirely to the shocks which appear in full hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "our ability to match observations with a simpler ( cloud - based ) approach gives us confidence that its use here is reasonable .",
    " figure [ f.barmodel ]     the right panel in figure [ f.barmodel ] shows a position - velocity cut through our model along the bar major axis .",
    "gas particles on  orbits are plotted as crosses , those on  orbits at the leading edge of the bar are plotted as diamonds , and those on  orbits at the trailing edge of the bar are plotted as dots .",
    "the  gas at the bar s leading edge and the separate  gas inside the outer ilr ( i.e. the diamonds and crosses ) form a `` tilted x '' pattern very similar to that seen in ngc5005 . moreover , the gas on the model  orbits has a maximum rotational speed much faster than the circular rotation speed for this potential ( shown as a solid line ) .",
    "this excess arises because the tangential velocity near the pericenter of an elliptical orbit is higher than the circular velocity .",
    "because the major axis of the bar is close to the major axis of the galaxy ( i.e. the line of nodes ) in ngc5005 , material on  orbits will reach pericenter while moving nearly along our line of sight .",
    "the bar model thus provides a natural explanation for why the linewidth of the nuclear disk exceeds that of the galaxy s full hi line ; we do not need to appeal to a large central mass .",
    "gas on  orbits at the leading edge of the bar , producing the shallower component of the `` tilted x '' pattern in the model p - v diagram , appears to have a velocity _ less _ than circular for ngc5005 .",
    "this deficit arises ( as above ) because the bar and galaxy major axes are nearly ( though not exactly ) parallel : streaming along the bar will occur more in the plane of the sky than along our line of sight . in the context of this model , the northwest stream seen in ngc5005 is clearly identified as gas moving towards the nuclear disk on an  orbit at the leading edge of the bar . more tentatively , we suggest that the emission at ( @xmath50 ) in figure [ f.barpv ] may also trace the leading edge of the bar on an  orbit",
    ". this feature ( a possible `` east stream '' ) can be marginally distinguished inside the 3kpc ring in the medium - resolution map of figure [ f.maps ] .",
    "little emission is seen in the regions of the p - v diagram corresponding to  orbits at the trailing edge of the bar , but this is not entirely surprising .",
    "many barred galaxies show strong concentrations of gas at the shocks which form in leading - edge dust lanes .",
    "the likely reason is that gas in a bar is directly channeled to a nuclear disk through  orbits at its leading edge . after colliding with the nuclear disk near pericenter and entering onto  orbits ,",
    "most of the gas is unavailable to flow past the nucleus and trace the trailing edge of the bar .",
    "this distinction between the behaviors of the stellar and gaseous components is emphasized by bureau & athanassoula ( 1999 ) and athanassoula & bureau ( 1999 ) in their extensive studies of p - v diagrams for barred galaxies .",
    "our own model confirms that p - v diagrams can sometimes tell us not only whether a bar supports two families of orbits , but also whether the gas on the  orbits is at the bar s leading or trailing edge .",
    "the 3kpc ring has a nearly circular shape but clearly noncircular velocities (  [ s.ring ] ) .",
    "figure [ f.hpvs ] shows position - velocity cuts along the galaxy s [ isophotal ] major and minor axes .",
    "the minor - axis p - v diagram clearly shows that the 3kpc ring has some degree of noncircular ( i.e. radial ) motion .",
    "the gas to the south ( north ) of the nucleus has negative ( positive ) velocities with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "the radial motion is directed inward with an amplitude of about 50   on the minor axis .",
    "we consider two possible scenarios for the origin of the ring and its inward motions  that it constitutes a canonical resonance ring at the inner 4:1 lindblad resonance , and alternately , that it is actually a pair of tightly wound spiral arms .",
    "although we prefer the former hypothesis , the latter can not be excluded with our current data .",
    "an inner 4:1 lindblad resonance region occurs where @xmath51 ( calculated assuming a purely axisymmetric potential ) is nearly equal to the pattern speed of the bar @xmath52 ( see reviews by buta & combes ( 1996 ) and sellwood & wilkinson ( 1993 ) ) ; it is more widely known as the `` ultraharmonic resonance '' ( uhr ) , nomenclature which we will adopt here .",
    "an `` inner '' ring which encircles a bar and falls inside spiral arms is often identified with the uhr ( e.g. schwarz 1984a ; buta 1986 ) .",
    "can the uhr ring scenario explain the inward velocities we see in ngc5005 ?",
    "the pattern speed chosen to produce figure [ f.barmodel ] places the model s uhr at a radius of 6.3 ; the ratio @xmath53 successfully matches the ratio between the radii of the 3kpc ring and the nuclear disk .",
    "if the 3kpc ring is truly a stable ring rather than a transient feature or a pair of spiral arms , its constituent clouds must follow closed orbits in the frame rotating with the bar . in this case",
    ", the velocities of material in the ring can be estimated from its shape ( buta 1986 ) .",
    "figure [ f.faceon ] shows a deprojected version of the co(10 ) emission from ngc5005 .",
    "the 3kpc ring is roughly circular , but is slightly elongated parallel to the bar with an axial ratio @xmath54 , consistent with the average axial ratio of 0.82 observed for inner rings in barred galaxies ( schwarz 1984b ) . in a frame rotating with the bar , gas motion will be counterclockwise anywhere inside corotation , including at the putative uhr . near the minor axis of the galaxy ( i.e. on the vertical line in figure [ f.faceon ] ) , gas on an elongated orbit in the ring will therefore be on its way from apocenter to pericenter and will appear to have an inward velocity .    ",
    "figure [ f.faceon ]     a more quantitative approach is taken in figure [ f.theta-v ] , in which line - of - sight velocities in the 3kpc ring are plotted with respect to azimuthal angle .",
    "it is evident that circular motion alone fails to reproduce the observations , leaving velocity residuals up to @xmath55 . in the uhr model",
    ", we can assume that noncircular velocities in an elongated ring will be sinusoidal with a phase delay roughly equal to the position angle of the bar .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ f.theta-v ] shows an elliptical - orbit model generated for this assumption which produces reasonable agreement with the observations , including the 50  noncircular velocity on the galaxy s minor axis ( azimuth @xmath56 ) .",
    "although we do not attempt parameter fitting for this model , the uhr hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with the pattern of noncircular motions in the 3kpc ring . in this scenario ,",
    "the spiral arms outside the ring need not be tightly wound , and the arm which runs east ( west ) on large scales probably starts from the east ( west ) end of the bar .     figure [ f.theta-v ]     an alternate explanation for the 3kpc ring is that it is not really a ring at all , but instead is a pair of tightly wound spiral arms .",
    "streaming motions in a spiral density wave will be directed inward along the minor axis for all radii inside corotation .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , roberts 1969 , and roberts & hausman 1984 ) as well as observations of a number of spiral galaxies ( e.g. m81 , visser 1980 ; m51 , vogel  1993 ) show inward motions on spiral arms near the minor axis inside corotation .",
    "the velocity  azimuth angle plot in figure [ f.theta-v ] supports one element of the tightly wound spiral arm picture .",
    "the residual velocities from circular motion are ( though somewhat scattered ) sinusoidal with a period of @xmath57 rather than @xmath58 , as expected for any ringlike feature inside corotation which is formed by density - wave spiral arms ( canzian 1993 ) .",
    "a cautionary note for this scenario is the sharply different pitch angle displayed by the spiral arms at larger galactocentric radii .",
    "we would at least expect the eastern ( western ) spiral arm to start from the west ( east ) end of the bar , if the spiral arms start from the bar s ends as is usually the case in barred galaxies .",
    "however , this picture may still necessitate a zero or ( unrealistically ) negative pitch angle for the `` arms '' comprising the ring ( see figure [ f.faceon ] ) .",
    "precise determination of the galaxy s inclination and position angle ( e.g. with hi mapping ) and large field - of - view color index maps would both help determine whether the 3kpc ring is a resonance ring at the uhr or is not a ring at all .",
    "we have shown that the northwest stream is a @xmath59  gas clump on its way from the 3kpc ring to the nuclear disk . at an infall speed of 200  and",
    "a distance of 1kpc from the center , most of this mass should soon collide and merge with the nuclear disk ; part of the stream should already be colliding with the outskirts of the disk .",
    "a crude estimate of the rate of accretion to the disk during this collision is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the size of the northwest stream and we assume that most of the stream material will merge with the nuclear disk during its first passage of pericenter (  [ s.bar-driven ] ) .",
    "the absence of inflowing gas along the full length of the bar means that the high accretion rate lasts for only a few myr , and that inflow must be largely episodic rather than continuous .",
    "the next episode after the present one may well occur as gas in the possible `` east stream '' moves inward .",
    "while a steady supply of tenuous gas may have escaped detection , the impending increase of the nuclear disk s mass by @xmath62 % seems likely to be more significant .",
    "as this fueling event progresses , we would expect it to produce cloud collisions , shocks , and gravitational instabilities in the nuclear disk , enhancing the star formation rate and ( perhaps ) the rate of inflow to the active nucleus .",
    "if the supply of gas to the nucleus is similarly episodic in other galaxies , we have a natural mechanism to regulate the intermittent triggering of nuclear starbursts , which balzano ( 1983 ) infers have a duty cycle of @xmath63 % .",
    "a connection between kpc - scale fueling and nuclear activity is likely to be more indirect at best , since accretion luminosity can be significantly boosted by the disruption of an individual star ( e.g. eracleous  1995 ) or gas cloud ( e.g. bottema & sanders 1986 ) .",
    "we have observed co(10 ) emission from the liner galaxy ngc5005 to study the gas dynamics in the central 6kpc ( 1 ) .    1 .   in its central 6kpc , ngc5005 has three distinct molecular gas components  a roughly circular ring of radius @xmath64 kpc and gas mass @xmath65 ; a central condensation with radius @xmath1 kpc and gas mass @xmath66 ; and a component with size @xmath67 kpc and gas mass @xmath59 , located about 6  northwest of the nucleus . the nuclear disk shows weaker co(10 ) emission in its innermost 100  200 pc .",
    "2 .   the 3kpc ring shows noncircular velocities , with 50 inward motions observed on the minor axis .",
    "the northwest stream has a very large noncircular motion ; its line - of - sight velocity is @xmath4  different from that of the circular galactic rotation .",
    "the nuclear disk has a linewidth @xmath68 % larger than that of the 3 kpc co ring and of the entire galaxy s hi emission .",
    "noncircular motions are also evident in the first moment map of the disk .",
    "3 .   a stellar bar of length @xmath63kpc may account for these gas distributions and their kinematics .",
    "the bar would run roughly east - west , placing the northwest stream and an associated straight dust lane at its leading edge .",
    "the nuclear disk is mainly formed from  orbits elongated perpendicular to the bar .",
    "the disk s large linewidth is probably due to clouds on elliptical orbits which move along our line of sight as they reach pericenter , rather than ( necessarily ) to a large mass concentration at the galactic center .",
    "the northwest stream lies on an  orbit elongated parallel to the bar ; it is falling towards the nuclear disk , with which it will ultimately collide and merge .",
    "4 .   the 3kpc ring may form at the ultraharmonic resonance of the bar or ( rather improbably ) constitute a pair of spiral arms which originate at its ends .",
    "noncircular motion would be explained in these scenarios by orbital motions in an elongated ring and by spiral - arm streaming , respectively .",
    "the supply of gas to the nuclear disk is episodic rather than continuous .",
    "gas from the outer galaxy will accumulate in the 3kpc ring and occasionally fall to the nuclear disk , as in the case of the northwest stream , due to the action of the bar .",
    "the present fueling event will ultimately increase the mass of the nuclear disk ( by about 10 % ) and impact star formation there within several myr .",
    "a subsequent fueling event may occur if gas in the possible `` east stream '' is truly flowing along the bar .",
    "such episodic supply of gas may be responsible for triggering intermittent nuclear starbursts in other disk galaxies .",
