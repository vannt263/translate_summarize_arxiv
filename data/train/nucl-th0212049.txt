    "among the various phenomenological interactions that have been used extensively in the description of nuclei , the skyrme force @xcite has gained much popularity because of its analytical simplicity and its ability to reproduce nuclear properties over the whole periodic table within the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation .",
    "several skyrme parameterizations have been tailored to account for single particle spectra @xcite , giant monopole resonances @xcite or fission barriers of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , a new skyrme force which also reproduces the equation of state of pure neutron matter up to neutron star densities , @xmath17 , has been proposed in ref.@xcite for the study of nuclei far from stability .",
    "a microscopic interpretation of the various parameters entering the effective skyrme forces is generally put aside .",
    "sometimes the energy density functional is just parameterized without reference to any effective ( zero - range ) two - body interaction in order to avoid the complete fixing of time - reversal - odd terms by the pauli - exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "another widely and successfully used approach to nuclear structure calculations are relativistic mean - field models @xcite . in these models",
    "the nucleus is described as a collection of independent dirac - particles moving in self - consistently generated scalar and vector mean - fields .",
    "the footprints of relativity become visible through the large nuclear spin - orbit interaction which emerges in that framework naturally from the interplay of the two strong and counteracting ( scalar and vector ) mean - fields .",
    "the corresponding many - body calculations are usually carried out in the hartree approximation , ignoring the negative - energy dirac - sea . for",
    "a recent review on self - consistent mean - field models for nuclear structure , see ref.@xcite .",
    "in that article the relationship between the relativistic mean - field models and the skyrme phenomenology is also discussed .",
    "the first conditions to be fulfilled by any phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interaction come from the ( few empirically known ) properties of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "these are the saturation density @xmath18 , the binding energy per particle @xmath19 and the compression modulus @xmath20 of isospin symmetric nuclear matter as well as the asymmetry energy @xmath21 . in general ,",
    "skyrme forces involve several more parameters related to terms in the energy density functional which vanish identically in homogeneous nuclear matter ( like the spin - orbit coupling proportional to the density - gradient ) .    in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we have used chiral perturbation theory for a systematic treatment of the nuclear matter many - body problem . in this calculation the contributions to the energy per particle , @xmath22 , originate exclusively from one- and two - pion exchange between nucleons and they are ordered in powers of the fermi momentum @xmath23 ( modulo functions of @xmath24 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the empirical saturation point @xmath25 and the nuclear matter compressibility @xmath26mev can be well reproduced at order @xmath27 in the small momentum expansion with just one single momentum cut - off scale of @xmath28gev which parameterizes the necessary short range nn - dynamics .",
    "most surprisingly , the prediction for the asymmetry energy , @xmath29mev , is in very good agreement with its empirical value .",
    "furthermore , as a nontrivial fact , pure neutron matter is predicted to be unbound and the corresponding equation of state @xmath30 agrees roughly with that of sophisticated many - body calculations for low neutron densities @xmath31@xmath32 . in a subsequent work @xcite , the momentum and density dependent ( real )",
    "single - particle potential @xmath33 has been calculated in the same framework .",
    "it was found that chiral @xmath34- and @xmath35-exchange give rise to a potential depth for a nucleon at the bottom of the fermi sea of @xmath36mev .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the depth of the empirical optical model potential and the nuclear shell model potential .",
    "in fact very similar results for nuclear matter can be obtained already at order @xmath37 in the small momentum expansion ( by dropping the relativistic @xmath38-correction to @xmath34-exchange and the irreducible @xmath35-exchange of order @xmath27 ) with a somewhat reduced cut - off scale of @xmath39gev . detailed results of this @xmath40-calculation can be found in ref.@xcite ( it is named `` mean - field treatment of the nn - contact interaction '' therein ) .",
    "given the fact that many properties of nuclear matter can be well described by chiral @xmath41-dynamics treated perturbatively up to three - loop order it is natural to consider in a further step the energy density functional relevant for inhomogeneous many - nucleon systems ( i.e. finite nuclei ) .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the isospin symmetric case of equal proton and neutron number n = z .",
    "the aim of this work is to calculate density - dependent generalizations of those combinations of skyrme parameters which belong to terms specific for the inhomogeneous many - nucleon system , such as @xmath42 .",
    "this novel density - dependence is a consequence of the finite range character of the @xmath34- and @xmath35-exchange interaction .",
    "we stress already here that our results for the density - dependent strength functions are completely parameterfree .",
    "in particular , they are independent of the cut - off scale @xmath43 adjusted in ref.@xcite to the binding energy per particle @xmath44mev .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "in the next section we recall the essential results of the density - matrix expansion of negele and vautherin @xcite which provides the adequate technical framework to compute the nuclear energy density functional . in section 3 , we then present analytical formulas for the various strength functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath8 entering the nuclear energy density functional",

    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of our results and finally section 5 ends with a summary and an outlook .",
    "the starting point for the construction of an explicit nuclear energy density functional is the density - matrix as given by a sum over the occupied energy eigenfunctions @xmath48 of this many - fermion system . according to negele and vautherin @xcite",

    "it is important to note that a pairwise filling of time - reversed orbitals @xmath57 has been assumed in eq.(1 ) .",

    "the single particle potential in nuclear matter can actually be constructed in the same way by introducing a delta - function like perturbation @xcite .",
    "consequently , the strength function @xmath45 can be directly expressed in terms of the real part @xmath33 of the momentum and density dependent single particle potential as : @xmath77 in eq.(5 ) the term @xmath78 is accompanied by @xmath79 . performing a partial integration of the energy @xmath80",

    "next , we show in fig.3 by the full line the strength function @xmath7 belonging to the @xmath42-term in the nuclear energy density functional eq.(6 ) versus the nucleon density @xmath166 .",
    "the three horizontal dashed lines represent the constant values @xmath167/64 $ ] of the skyrme forces sly @xcite , siii @xcite and msk @xcite . in the case of sly and msk we have performed averages over the various parameter sets sly4 - 7 and msk1 - 6 . at nuclear matter saturation density @xmath168 our parameterfree prediction",
    "@xmath169 is comparable to these empirical values .",
    "the strong increase of the strength function @xmath7 with decreasing density has to do with the presence of a small mass scale , @xmath170mev , and with associated chiral singularities ( of the form @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) .",
    "we will come back to this issue again towards the end of this section .",
    "an accurate fit of the full line in fig.3 is : @xmath173",
    ". it may be useful for applications in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "note also that the relevant contribution to the central single - particle potential , @xmath174 , receives only little weight from very low densities",
    ". therefore the deviation of the strength function @xmath7 from a constant may be less dramatic in practice than it appears on first sight from fig.3 .",
    "the full line in fig.4 shows the result of iterated @xmath34-exchange for the strength function @xmath47 belonging to the spin - orbit coupling term in the nuclear energy density functional . for comparison",
    "we have drawn the constant values @xmath175 of the three skyrme forces sly @xcite , siii @xcite and msk @xcite ( horizontal dashed lines ) .",
    "one observes that the strength of the nuclear spin - orbit interaction as generated by iterated @xmath34-exchange is at @xmath176 about half as large as the corresponding empirical value , however , with the wrong negative sign .",
    "this `` negative '' result is dominated by the contribution of the iterated @xmath177-exchange hartree diagram with two medium insertions ( see eq.(13 ) ) .",
    "for example , one obtains numerically from eq.(13 ) at saturation density @xmath178 ( where @xmath179 ) the negative value @xmath180 .",
    "the other diagrams with lower spin- and isospin weight factors reduce this number approximately half in magnitude .",
    "the `` negative '' result for @xmath47 is to some extent already indicated by the calculation of the momentum and density dependent nuclear spin - orbit strength @xmath181 in ref.@xcite .",
    "going back to the medium insertion in eq.(5 ) one learns that only the values of @xmath181 near the fermi surface @xmath182 will contribute to @xmath47 . as a matter of fact the curves in fig.7 of ref.@xcite drop from positive to negative values when @xmath102 runs from zero to @xmath183mev",
    "actually , for the contributions to @xmath184 from diagrams with two medium insertions eqs.(13,16 ) the following relationship holds : @xmath185_{p = k_f } \\,,\\ ] ] to be applied to the expressions @xmath186 in eqs.(9,17 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that irreducible two - pion exchange generates ( via relativistic @xmath187-corrections ) spin - orbit amplitudes in the t - matrix of elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "their effect on the nuclear spin - orbit interaction has been calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "inserting the expression @xmath188 in eq.(18 ) of ref.@xcite into the `` master formula '' eq.(32 ) one derives the following contribution from irreducible @xmath35-exchange to the spin - orbit strength function : @xmath189 \\arctan{k_f \\over m_\\pi } \\bigg\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath43 is a momentum cut - off which has been used to regularize the linear divergences of the irreducible @xmath35-exchange ( triangle and box ) diagrams . in dimensional regularization ( employed in eqs.(22,23 ) of ref.@xcite ) such linear divergences are not visible .",
    "the dashed - dotted line in fig.4 shows the relatively small contribution of irreducible @xmath35-exchange to the spin - orbit strength @xmath47 for a cut - off scale of @xmath190gev @xcite .",
    "we note that without the zero - range @xmath43-dependent term in eq.(33 ) the dashed - dotted curve would be shifted downward by @xmath191 to negative values .",
    "in this context we mention also the relativistic @xmath38-correction to @xmath47 from the @xmath34-exchange fock diagram . inserting the expression @xmath192 in eq.(6 ) of ref.@xcite into the `` master formula '' eq.(32 )",
    "leads to the simple result : @xmath193/ ( 16mf_\\pi u)^2 $ ] , with @xmath93 . as expected",
    ", this contribution with @xmath194 is negligibly small .",
    "the full line in fig.4 is accurately fitted by : @xmath195 .",
    "finally , we show in fig.5 the strength function @xmath8 accompanying the squared spin - orbit density @xmath9 in the nuclear energy density functional versus the nucleon density @xmath166 . for comparison we have drawn the constant values @xmath196/32 $ ] of the three skyrme forces msk @xcite , siii @xcite and sly @xcite ( dashed lines ) .",
    "one observes that our prediction for @xmath8 is considerably larger .",
    "again , there is a strong rise of the strength function @xmath8 as one goes down to very low nucleon densities @xmath197 .",
    "this time the dominant contribution comes from the iterated @xmath34-exchange hartree diagram with three medium insertions eq.(21 ) , which gives numerically at saturation density @xmath198 .",
    "it should also be noted that the @xmath9-term in the energy density functional is often neglected in nuclear structure calculations . the full line in fig.5 is accurately fitted by : @xmath199 , which may be useful for implementation into nuclear structure calculations . note also that the @xmath9-term in the energy density functional gives rise to an additional spin - orbit single - particle field of the form @xmath200 . according to our calculation this additional spin - orbit field would be rather large and strongly density dependent .",
    "the full curves in figs.3,5 show a strong increase as the density @xmath81 tends to zero .",
    "although not visible , each curve approaches a finite value at @xmath201 .",
    "one can analytically derive the following low density limits : @xmath202 = 571.3\\,{\\rm mevfm}^5 \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath203 = 339.2\\,{\\rm mevfm}^5 \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath204 = 552.2\\,{\\rm mevfm}^5 \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath205 to which only the diagrams with two medium insertions contribute .",
    "the large numbers in eqs.(34 - 37 ) arise from negative powers of the pion mass @xmath146 ( so - called chiral singularities ) .",
    "the most singular @xmath171-terms can be traced back to the @xmath34-exchange fock diagram .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that if pionic degrees of freedom are treated explicitly in the nuclear matter problem the low density limit is realized only at extremely low densities @xmath206 .",
    "often , the opposite limit where the pion mass @xmath146 can be neglected against the fermi momentum @xmath23 is already applicable at the moderate densities relevant for conventional nuclear physics .",
    "this is exemplified here by the approximate density dependence @xmath207 .",
    "such a @xmath208-behavior becomes exact in the chiral limit @xmath209 as can be deduced by simple mass dimension counting of the dominant iterated @xmath34-exchange diagrams ( the basic argument is that @xmath210 has the correct unit of mev@xmath211 ) .",
    "in this work we have calculated the nuclear energy density functional @xmath212 $ ] relevant for n = z even - even nuclei in the systematic framework of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "our calculation includes the @xmath34-exchange fock diagram and the iterated @xmath34-exchange hartree and fock diagrams .",
    "these few leading order contributions in the small momentum expansion give already a very good equation of state of isospin symmetric infinite nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the step to inhomogeneous many - nucleon systems is done with the help of the density - matrix expansion of negele and vautherin @xcite .",
    "our results for the strength functions @xmath45 , @xmath7 , @xmath47 and @xmath8 ( density dependent generalizations of combinations of skyrme force parameters ) are parameterfree .",
    "we find that the effective nucleon mass @xmath0 deviates at most by @xmath213 from its free space value @xmath2 , with @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for higher densities @xmath214 .",
    "the latter enhancement can be understood from galitskii s second order calculation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a recent large scale fit of ( almost two thousand ) nuclide masses by pearson et al .",
    "@xcite finds a similarly enhanced effective nucleon mass : @xmath215 .",
    "the strength of the @xmath42-term , @xmath216 , is comparable to that of phenomenological skyrme forces .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath217 accompanying the squared spin - orbit density @xmath9 comes out larger .",
    "the strength of the nuclear spin - orbit interaction , @xmath218 , as given by iterated @xmath34-exchange is about half as large as the corresponding empirical value @xmath219mev@xmath211 , however , with the wrong negative sign . since the ( positive ) contribution from irreducible @xmath35-exchange to @xmath47 is relatively small , there remains the challenge of understanding the microscopic origin of the nuclear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "evidently , chiral perturbation theory can not properly account for the underlying mechanisms , whereas relativistic scalar - vector mean - field models give a successful phenomenology of the nuclear spin - orbit force .",
    "lorentz scalar and vector mean - fields with their in - medium behavior governed by qcd sum rules could also provide the appropriate framework for that @xcite .",
    "the novel density dependencies of @xmath0 and @xmath220 as predicted by our parameterfree calculation should be explored and examined in future nuclear structure calculations ( after adding a suitable positive constant to @xmath47 in order to minimally repair the spin - orbit coupling ) . of course one",
    "should keep in mind that the prominent low - density behavior of @xmath7 as well as @xmath8 carries little weight in the tails of nuclear density distributions .    for an extension to even - even nuclei with @xmath221",
    "the first obvious step would be to include the density dependent asymmetry energy @xmath222 @xcite ( subtracted by its kinetic energy contribution ) in the nuclear energy density functional : @xmath223   & = & { \\cal e}[\\rho , \\tau,\\vec j\\ , ] + { \\cal e}_{coul}[\\rho_p , \\tau_p,\\vec j_p ]    + { ( \\rho_n-\\rho_p)^2 \\over \\rho } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\bigg\\{a(k_f)-{k_f^2 \\over 6 m }   + { k_f^4\\over 12m^3 } -{5\\tau k_f^2\\over 56\\rho m^3}\\bigg\\ } + \\dots \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 . in an ordering scheme where one counts deviations from homogeneity and deviations from isospin symmetry simultaneously as small the energy density functional in eq.(38 ) would already be complete .",
    "however , such a formal consideration may be too simplistic in view of neutron skins , neutron halos etc . in any case , the density - matrix expansion in eq.(1 ) can be straightforwardly generalized to the isospin asymmetric situation and this way the strength functions of terms like @xmath227 ( \\rho_n-\\rho_p)$ ] , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 in the nuclear energy density functional become also accessible in our diagrammatic framework . for the coulomb energy density @xmath231",
