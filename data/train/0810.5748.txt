    "excitons in single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) are stable quasi - particles with large binding energies and significantly influence their interband optical properties.@xcite however , they have been reported to be rather efficiently eliminated at high densities through the exciton - exciton annihilation ( eea ) process,@xcite although their emission and absorption energies remain stable even at high densities.@xcite recently , the intensity of photoluminescence ( pl ) from swnts was found to saturate at high pump fluence,@xcite implying the existence of an upper limit in the density of excitons , which was estimated to be an order of magnitude smaller than the expected mott density .",
    "the existence of such an upper limit , which poses a significant hinderance in the observation of lasing , a mott transition , or excitonic bose - einstein condensation in swnts , was attributed to efficient eea facilitated by the diffusive motion of excitons.@xcite    the dynamics of diffusion - limited eea can be analyzed in the general context of reaction - diffusion processes , which have been extensively studied by physicists , chemists , biologists , and ecologists and serve as simple models for studying a variety of non - equilibrium problems.@xcite moreover , it has been shown that such simple diffusion - driven reactions exhibit interesting non - equilibrium phase transitions and universality classes,@xcite with connections to many - body theory.@xcite in such models , particles , or  agents , \" of one or more species execute random walk in @xmath0-dimensions ( where @xmath0 could also be fractional in the case of fractal geometry ) and undergo reactions upon collisions , leading to changes in their population often accompanied by an appearance and disappearance of various phases .",
    "such systems often exhibit rich phase diagrams that can be fully studied with numerical simulations even when analytical solutions are not available .",
    "for example , a widely studied reaction is the two - particle annihilation given by @xmath1 @xmath2 0 , where the interaction is assumed to be of the  hard - core \" type , leading to the mutual destruction of two particles upon collision.@xcite starting with an initial population @xmath3 , one can analyze the ensemble averaged population @xmath4 at a given time @xmath5 . clearly , this is a non - equilibrium many - particle process that is driven by noise , and its only steady state is achieved when the population vanishes .",
    "an interesting feature of diffusion - driven reactions is the presence of spatio - temporal fluctuations in such processes that can not be ignored especially at lower dimensions and lead to the breakdown of mean - field type assumptions .",
    "for example , diffusion - driven two - particle annihilation can be written in differential form as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for an ensemble average .",
    "the first term on the right denotes the diffusion process , while the second term is for two - particle annihilation and thus has quadratic dependence .",
    "note that the annihilation term has an average of @xmath8 whereas mean - field theory will simplify this to @xmath9 , thus neglecting fluctuations of the form @xmath10 . in one dimension",
    ", the population asymptotically decays as @xmath11 power - law whereas the mean - field theory , which ignores fluctuations , predicts a faster decay of @xmath12 .",
    "this discrepancy originates from the fact that @xmath0-dimensional diffusion with @xmath13 is _ recurrent _ and the particles return to their previous position with high probability.@xcite hence , the reaction is slowed down leading to a smaller exponent in the power - law decay .",
    "indeed , the mean - field result is recovered in three dimensions , which is above the critical dimension @xmath14 = 2 for this problem.@xcite thus , an exact treatment of even such a simple process requires the inclusion of correlations .    in this paper , we undertake a time - dependent study of the diffusion - limited eea process in the presence of radiative decay .",
    "in particular , we consider the following two coupled and competing reaction - diffusion processes in 1-d to model the dynamics of excitons in nanotubes at various densities :    @xmath15    [ rd1 ]    where @xmath16 represents excitons and @xmath17 photons .",
    "the first equation represents exciton - exciton annihilation , which is either complete ( @xmath18 = 0 ) or partial ( @xmath18 = 1 ) , while the second reaction is just the radiative decay of excitons with radiative lifetime @xmath19",
    "= @xmath20 .",
    "it is noteworthy that only the first reaction is diffusion - driven whereas as the radiative decay takes place independently .",
    "this diffusive motion of excitons is due to the random collisions with phonons.@xcite in this sense , the annihilation reaction is driven by diffusive noise , which we assume to be of the gaussian form , whereas the radiative decay is governed by a poissonian noise and , hence , is a pure jump process .",
    "we consider a simple diffusion process in which the diffusion constant @xmath21 is independent of the spatial and temporal coordinates .",
    "furthermore , the excitonic dimension is assumed to be much smaller than the nanotube dimension .",
    "we are interested in determining the population of both species as a function of time .",
    "the population of species @xmath17 , or photons , is proportional to the pl intensity measured experimentally . in particular",
    ", we wish to know the fraction of population which decays radiatively and how this fraction changes as the initial population is increased .",
    "as one can imagine , upon increasing the initial density of excitons in the 1-d nanotube the annihilation reaction becomes more efficient whereas the radiative decay rate can be safely assumed to be independent of the density .",
    "as we show later , this leads to saturation of the pl intensity as the initial population density is increased , which is consistent with the experimental observations.@xcite",
    "the case of two - particle annihilation without the radiative decay has been extensively studied , and exact results for the population as a function of time are known.@xcite here we use the first - passage time distribution of brownian motion to first study the annihilation reaction without decay .",
    "we recover the exact analytical results for this case before proceeding to include the radiative decay term .",
    "we begin by deriving the exact result for a single pair , or the  independent pairs \" case , and use it to obtain an approximate solution for the many - particle , or the  correlated \" case .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed to check the validity of our results .",
    "this purely stochastic method employing the first - passage time distribution is a simple and natural way to study the annihilation reaction as the collisions which drive the reactions must obey such distributions .",
    "consider @xmath3 pairs of species @xmath16 randomly arranged on a line of length @xmath22 and executing brownian diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath21 .",
    "let us first consider just the two - particle annihilation process without the decay as in eq .",

    "we keep the discussion in this section as general as possible without explicitly identifying species @xmath16 or @xmath17 unless absolutely required .    in 1-d",
    ", only the nearest neighbors at any given time can undergo annihilation due to restrictions placed by lower dimensionality .",
    "this prompts us to first consider the case for a single pair of particles and generalize the result to the many - particle case .",
    "as this is equivalent to different pairs annihilating independently of each other , we refer to it as the  independent pair \" case .",
    "let @xmath24 be the initial distance between the pair and @xmath25 denote the survival probability of this pair at time @xmath5 . to calculate @xmath25 , we need to find the probability that a pair with initial distance @xmath24 does not undergo collision till time @xmath5 . as both particles are executing independent brownian motion ,",
    "their relative motion is also brownian with diffusion constant @xmath26 which starts at @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we need to find the probability that a brownian motion starting at @xmath24 does not reach zero till time @xmath5 . this can be readily found from the first - passage time distribution of a brownian motion as@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the error function .",
    "for the independent pair case , the fraction of population that is alive at time @xmath5 , @xmath23 , reads @xmath29 where the distance between the particles of the @xmath30-th pair is @xmath31 at time @xmath32 .",
    "we have imposed a periodic boundary condition making the line into a ring without any loss of generality . as @xmath3 tends to infinity",
    ", the above sum can be expressed as an integral over the distribution of @xmath31s .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the particles are randomly arranged on the line at @xmath5 = 0 .",
    "thus , @xmath31s which are the nearest neighbor distances can be thought of as the  waiting times \" for a poisson process and have an exponential distribution with mean @xmath33 = @xmath34 .",
    "for the many - particle case we realize that there are twice as many ways for a pair to annihilate as for the independent case due to the presence of two nearest neighbors for each particle , and hence , the mean distance for the correlated case is just a half of the independent case in the large @xmath35 limit .",
    "for this limit , the exact result can be obtained as @xmath36 which is the result of torney _",

    "the initial correlations between the particles are completely wiped out , and this power - law decay is expected , irrespective of the initial distribution of particles .",

    "in addition , at lower temperatures exciton localization due to impurity traps or defects could completely stop the diffusive motion of excitons , further enabling the attainment of the mott density.@xcite    finally , in our model , we have assumed a completely random motion of excitons , which leads to ordinary diffusion based on a gaussian kernel .",
