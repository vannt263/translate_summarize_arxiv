    "@xcite argued that the fermi surface change associated with this transition is a key to understanding anomalous normal state properties .",
    "recent studies in the pnictides  @xcite , heavy fermion materials  @xcite and organic superconductors  @xcite focus on the relation between the sdw and superconductivity .",
    "in fact , strong experimental similarities between quantum critical behavior in the organics , pnictides and cuprates have been pointed out recently  @xcite .",
    "the electron - doped cuprates  @xcite have provided an early example where quantum critical behavior has been inferred from the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperature .",
    "it was measured to be linear  @xcite from 35mk to 10k in pr@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath13 ( pcco ) at doping @xmath14 .",
    "more recent transport  @xcite and thermopower measurements  @xcite also suggest the presence of a quantum critical point at a similar doping .",
    "the precise nature of the quantum critical point remains however unclear , as thoroughly discussed in ref .  .",
    "for example , it has also been suggested that the quantum critical point coincides with the onset of superconductivity in the overdoped regime  @xcite .    .",
    "the arrows gives examples of pseudo - nesting conditions , namely of points such that @xmath15 is equal to the antiferromagnetic wave vector .",
    "the @xmath0 ordering wave - vector is defined with respect to the @xmath16 coordinate system . in the field theory approach introduced later , we work in the rotated ( @xmath17 ) coordinate system . ]    here we study quantum critical behavior associated with the transition between a sdw phase and a fermi liquid when the wave vector @xmath0 of the sdw connects hot spots with parallel fermi velocities .",

    ", the fermi wave vector would satisfy the condition @xmath18 .",
    "we call this pseudo - nesting  @xcite",
    ". we will explain why the qcp can be located at , or close to , the pseudo - nesting filling @xmath19 .",
    "this occurs naturally in the one - band hubbard model for the electron - doped cuprates and we will perform some of our calculations specifically for this case , although the frequency and temperature dependencies that we find are valid more generally .",
    "the methods that we describe below can be applied to electron - doped cuprates because these materials are described by a hubbard model in an intermediate coupling regime where one can neglect effects induced by mott physics  @xcite .",
    "the theory of hertz  @xcite and millis@xcite has formed the basis for much of the work on quantum critical phenomena . in this approach ,",
    "fermions are integrated out and an effective bosonic theory for the collective modes is studied using standard renormalization group methods that can be taken to high order  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out by abanov and chubukov  @xcite that for a commensurate sdw at the upper critical dimension , namely @xmath20 for @xmath4 , all the coefficients of the bosonic theory are singular so that one must treat simultaneously the bosonic collective modes and the fermions .",
    "metlitski and sachdev  @xcite have reexamined this problem and obtained the non - fermi liquid behavior at the hot spots , and shown that the bosonic sdw spectrum does not obey dynamic scaling with @xmath4 but instead that a super - power - law form is obtained .",
    "they have also thoroughly discussed the failure of the @xmath21 expansion at higher order , leading to a strong - coupling problem .",
    "more recently , it has been argued @xcite that non - fermi liquid corrections are also important away from the hot spots .",
    "an alternate approach is the self - consistent - renormalized theory of moriya  @xcite .",
    "it is in the universality class of the spherical model and as such its critical behavior will not be exactly that expected for the o(3 ) model .",
    "nevertheless , it can be accurate away from the critical point and provide leading order estimates for the exponents .",
    "the two - particle - self - consistent ( tpsc ) theory  @xcite is a related approach that has critical behavior similar to that of moriya , including logarithmic corrections  @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage that although it is an approximate solution to the hubbard model , it is quantitatively very close to benchmark quantum monte carlo results  @xcite .",
    "it is non - perturbative , does not include any phenomenological parameters , has internal consistency checks , and satisfies a number of exact results .",
    "previous theoretical studies have mostly been done for the case where the quantum critical point occurs when the fermi velocities at the hot spots that are connected by the sdw are not parallel , unlike the case of parallel velocities we consider here ( see fig .",
    "[ bzf ] ) .",
    "such a case of parallel fermi velocities is generic in one dimension , but at first sight appears as an accident in two dimensions , because upon translation by the @xmath0 sdw wave vector , the fermi surfaces touch at only one point .",
    "if the surfaces were flat , we would recover the case of perfect nesting encountered in one dimension .",
    "the curvature here provides a cutoff , and so we refer to the situation with parallel fermi velocities as `` pseudo - nesting ''  @xcite .",
    "such fermi surfaces have also been studied in three dimensions  @xcite , but in the presence of this pseudo - nesting the spin susceptibility is singular in two dimensions  @xcite and the analysis must be redone .",
    "altshuler , ioffe and millis  @xcite first looked at the case where the instability is at @xmath22 , hence connects parallel segments of the fermi surface , but the sdw wavelength is not commensurate with the lattice .",
    "they found that the transition is weakly first order with an intermediate scaling regime when the sdw wavelength is close to @xmath0 .",
    "the scaling regime was obtained in a systematic expansion in a number proportional to the inverse number of fermion flavors .",
    "krotkov and chubukov  @xcite found different results for the self - energy .",
    "here we consider only the commensurate case .",
    "some of our results differ from those of previous authors because they overlooked the significance of the umklapp process shown by the top double arrow in fig .",

    "we use two different approaches .",
    "we obtain finite temperature results appropriate for the sdw quantum critical point of electron - doped cuprates using tpsc .",

    "in this section , we introduce the model and give generic arguments why we expect the quantum critical point to often be located close to the filling where translation by the antiferromagnetic wave vector leads to fermi surfaces that are tangent to each other , as illustrated in fig .  [ bzf ] .",
    "while the frequency and temperature dependencies that we find do not depend on details of the model , specific numerical examples at finite temperature calculations will be performed on the two - dimensional @xmath23 hubbard model on the square lattice at weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "the model is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the hopping integrals , @xmath26 are the site index , @xmath27 is the spin label , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the particle creation and annihilation operators .",
    "doubly occupied sites cost an energy @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "units are such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and lattice spacing is unity .",
    "the kinetic energy of a single - particle excitation in momentum space is obtained from@xmath34 with the sum over @xmath35 running over all neighbors of any of the sites @xmath36 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath37 is chosen so that we have the required density .",
    "one can explain on general grounds the filling where the qcp is likely to occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : suscepatqcp ] displays the lindhard function @xmath38 along the @xmath39 direction for different fillings . its maximum is at @xmath0 so it is symmetric in @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "there are two remarkable features .",
    "first , below a certain doping @xmath19 , the maximum value is almost independent of filling  @xcite , and second it falls rapidly as soon as the filling exceeds @xmath19 .",
    "the filling @xmath19 corresponds to the point where the fermi surfaces joined by @xmath0 touch instead of intersecting .",
    "a @xmath41 change in filling leads to almost @xmath42 drop in value of the susceptibility .",
    "if we consider a simple stoner criterion for the transition , we would conclude that if @xmath30 takes the value @xmath43 , then the qcp would be close to this filling @xmath19 .",
    "this does not require fine tuning because the value of @xmath30 that should enter the stoner criterion is the value renormalized by kanamori - brckner screening  @xcite .",
    "this renormalized value becomes essentially @xmath30 independent when @xmath30 becomes of the order of the bandwidth because the two - body wave function creates a cusp to minimize double - occupancy  @xcite and the renormalized interaction can not become larger .",
    "this maximum renormalized value in tpsc , @xmath44 , takes a value  @xcite near @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , in tpsc the value of @xmath44 self - consistently adjusts itself to the value necessary to prevent a finite temperature phase transition on the sdw side of the qcp .",
    "although , at sufficiently low temperature , details will start to matter and one needs to start to tune the value of @xmath30 to find the qcp precisely at @xmath19 , there is an intermediate temperature scale that can be quite broad where fine tuning is unnecessary .",
    "point as a function of doping for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , values that are appropriate for electron - doped cuprates .",
    "the rapid fall with filling larger than @xmath49 , close to the critical filling , is apparent.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "in this section , we use the non - perturbative two - particle self - consistent ( tpsc ) approach @xcite .",
    "this approach respects the pauli principle , the mermin - wagner theorem and conversation laws .",
    "it also contains quantum fluctuations in crossed channels that lead to kanamori - brckner screening .",
    "@xcite it is valid in the weak to intermediate coupling regime @xmath50 and not too deep in the renormalized classical regime where a pseudogap is observed .",
    "it has been benchmarked on quantum monte carlo calculations on the hubbard model . @xcite .",
    "tpsc has been shown to be in the @xmath51 universality class of the @xmath52 model @xcite .",
    "it has the same critical behavior as moriya theory and hence has the same logarithmic corrections  @xcite .",
    "these logarithms have the same functional form as those of the renormalization group asymptotically close to the quantum critical point , but in tpsc and in moriya theory the mode - mode coupling term does not flow , hence the corrections may differ in the details from the renormalization group  @xcite",
    ". quantum critical behavior of the susceptibility and of the self - energy in the closely related spin - fermion model has been discussed by abanov et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been argued from detailed comparisons of numerical calculations with experiment  @xcite that strong - coupling physics is not important for electron - doped cuprates , at least not too close to half - filling .",
    "hence , tpsc is appropriate to study these compounds .",
    "it gives a satisfactory description of arpes data  @xcite , and the temperature @xmath53 , where the pseudogap seen in arpes opens up experimentally , corresponds to that where the antiferromagnetic correlation length coincides with the thermal de broglie wavelength  @xcite , as predicted for two - dimensional precursors of three - dimensional long - range order  @xcite .",
    "hence , all the numerical results are presented in units where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath32 ( with @xmath56 component of spin defined by @xmath57 ) for values of the hubbard model hopping parameters appropriate for electron - doped cuprates , namely second and third nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "interaction strengths @xmath46 and @xmath58 , again in the range appropriate for electron - doped cuprates ,  @xcite will be considered .",
    "we first present the formalism and then give analytical and numerical results for the qcp .",

    "irreducible vertices are obtained self - consistently and in such a way that the pauli principle and conservation laws are obeyed . the formal derivation is given in refs .  .",

    "this chemical potential @xmath37 is slightly different from the one that we must use in @xmath82 to obtain the same density @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise specified , all the numerical results below are obtained using the matsubara frequency version of equations ( [ chisp ] ) to ( [ self ] ) without any approximation , hence they are valid at arbitrary distance from the quantum critical point .",
