    "the directed transport in such systems , generally known as ratchet effect , has a long history and is relevant for different fields of physics .",

    "recently , we have reported an experimental realization of this idea with some modifications .",
    "@xcite the photocurrent has been observed in semiconductor heterostructures with a one - dimensional lateral periodic potential induced by etching a noncentrosymmetric grating into the sample cap layer .",
    "hence , the in - plane modulation of the pump radiation appears not via a mask with periodic structures but due to near - field effects of terahertz ( thz ) radiation propagating through the grating .",
    "this photothermal effect , called also seebeck ratchet effect ,  @xcite is polarization independent and can be generated even at normal incidence of light .",
    "here , we report on the observation and study of radiation induced ratchet effects sensitive to the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light and , in the case of circularly polarized light , to the photon helicity . the theoretical analysis has enabled us to propose microscopic mechanisms of the observed circular and linear ratchet effects , and to demonstrate that they are related to the combined action of an out - of - phase periodic potential and an in - plane modulated pumping of the two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) .",
    "the investigation of these ratchet effects has also been performed on a new set of laterally structured samples with a better controlled asymmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the theory of ratchet effects stemming from the combined action of the lateral periodic potential and the in - plane pumping by the thz field modulated by the near - field diffraction .",
