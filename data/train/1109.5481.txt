    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupling of the rashba@xcite or dresselhaus@xcite type has been widely studied in condensed matter physics . such so coupling  linear in momentum  is equivalent to non - abelian vector potentials built from the spin-1/2 pauli matrices@xcite .",
    "laser - atom coupling in the tripod configuration@xcite gives rise to two degenerate dark states whose hamiltonian is equivalent to that of spin @xmath1-particles with rashba - dresselhaus ( rd ) so coupling@xcite . with such coupling ,",
    "the atomic dark states play the role of the spin - up and spin - down states . in the tripod scheme ,",
    "the degenerate dark states are not the lowest energy eigenstates of the atom - light hamiltonian , thus atoms can decay out of the dark state manifold due to collisions and other relaxation processes , potentially impairing experimental realizations .    here , we propose a technique for generating rd type so coupling using five laser - dressed levels of an atom .",
    "lasers couple each of three internal atomic states to two other mutually uncoupled states to form a double tripod ( fig .",
    "[ fig : double - tripod ] ) .",
    "we show that with proper choice of the amplitudes and phases of the laser fields the atom - light hamiltonian has a pair of degenerate eigenstates with the lowest energy . these are separated from the remaining eigenstates by a gap determined by the rabi frequencies of the atom - light coupling . as in the tripod case ,",
    "elimination of the excited states produces and effective hamiltonian containing rd type so coupling for the resulting spin-1/2 system .",
    "since the degenerate states are lowest in energy , they do not experience relaxation to other states .",
    "( spontaneous emission from the laser fields remains an issue@xcite . )",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we now discuss a possible experimental implementation of the double tripod scheme applicable to the commonly used alkali - metal atoms . in order to avoid a rampant heating due to spontaneous emission",
    ", one can take the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be the hyperfine ground states with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : implementation ] .",
    "the states @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) are different zeeman sublevels of the ground state with total angular momentum @xmath4 or @xmath5 , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the coupling between the state @xmath13 and the state @xmath8 is provided by a pair of laser beams that induce a raman transition under the condition of the two - photon resonance .",
    "the use of raman transitions in this context is an extension to the double tripod case of a recent proposal@xcite to implement a @xmath14 ( ladder ) type scheme for the generation of an effective magnetic field by means of counter propagating laser beams@xcite .",
    "we studied dressed hamiltonian of raman - driven cold atoms in which the lasers couple three atomic internal states to another two states in a double tripod topology . by properly choosing the amplitudes and phases of the laser fields the atom - light hamiltonian has a pair of degenerate eigenstates with the lowest energy .",
    "they are separated from the remaining eigenstates by a gap determined by the rabi frequencies of the atom - light coupling .",
    "adiabatically eliminating the upper states , the atomic center of mass motion in the pair of the degenerate internal states is characterized by the so coupling of the rashba or dresselhaus type for a spin @xmath1 particle .",
    "since the degenerate atomic states are the internal states with the lowest energy , there is no relaxation to other atomic states .",
    "this by - passes the problem arising in the previously studied tripod scheme@xcite ( or a more general @xmath15-pod scheme@xcite ) where the degenerate dark states represent the excited atomic internal states .",
    "note that alternatively one can generate the so coupling for a pair of lowest energy atomic states using a closed loop setup considered elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the suggested scheme can be implemented using the raman transitions between the atomic hyperfine ground states .",
    "the creation of so coupling for cold atoms has a number potential applications including _",
    "inter alia _ their quasi - relativistic behavior and zitterbewegung@xcite , as well as generating so coupled bose - einstein condensates or degenerate fermi gases with unusual properties@xcite .",
