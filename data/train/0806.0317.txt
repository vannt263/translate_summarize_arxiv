    "currently , asymmetric pulses are producible with a duration from few hundreds femtoseconds up to nanoseconds @xcite .",
    "the optical cycle of the electric field of the asymmetric pulse consists of a short half cycle followed by a much longer and weaker half cycle of an opposite polarity .",
    "hence , under certain conditions , the external field acts as a unipolar pulse and therefore it is referred to as an half - cycle pulse ( hcp ) .    in this study",

    "the energy scale is set by field - free eigenfrequency of the ring .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that even though the light does not couple directly to the spin ( at the intensities considered here ) the presence of soi leads to a temporal spin - splitting in the non - equilibrium local charge density . the resulting non - equilibrium , local spin polarization is perpendicular to the light - pulse polarization axis .",
    "it oscillates with the same frequency of the spin - split charge density and thus its time average vanishes .",
    "experimentally , the induced polarization is measurable by detecting the associated radiation emission .",

    "the soi strength ( quantified by @xmath46 ) has a dramatic influence on the low frequency modulation of the dipole - moment envelope .",

    "are excited and correspondingly further frequencies in unit of @xmath242 emerge at @xmath245 and @xmath246 ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) . in this context",
    "we note that a very short hcp contains almost all frequencies",
    ". nevertheless , at low intensities only a limited number of states in the ring can be excited .",
    "the reason is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ energy3 ] ) .",
    "the highest energy level achieved upon excitation is @xmath247 .",
    "hence there is an excited energy cut - off set by the field intensity ( available photons ) and limits consequently for a certain @xmath217 the number of possible frequencies observable in the power spectrum ( as seen in fig .",

    "4(b ) shows how the soi shifts of the frequencies : with increasing @xmath240 the frequency at 49 moves towards a higher frequency while the frequency at 51 moves to a lower frequency . for the angle @xmath248",
    "we infer @xmath249 and the two frequencies merge into one frequency . further increasing the soi strength , i.e. @xmath250 , the frequency peak from 51",

    "furthermore , the parity of the occupation number is very important for the property of dipole moment of the ring .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath257 , the case @xmath167 ( @xmath174 ) behaves similarly to @xmath171 ( @xmath181 ) in which cases the occupations are even ( odd ) .",
    "however , the even case is qualitatively different from the odd case ( not shown in fig .",
    "5 ) . if @xmath258 the oscillations of the dipole moment are different in all the cases depicted in fig .",
    "a static external magnetic field lifts the spin degeneracy of the dipole moment .",
    "the induced dipole moment dynamics becomes spin dependent ( cf .",
    "the slow - frequency shift between the dipole - moment oscillations in the up - spin and down - spin channels is readily understood from the energy splitting ( cf .",

    "7 shows the time - evolution of the spin - dependent icdv . in all cases depicted in fig",
    "7 the static flux is absent .",
    "for @xmath90 we observe , as expected , how the pulse kicks the charge density along the pulse - polarization axis . for the given time moment",
    ", the missing charge density around @xmath271 is pushed to the region around @xmath272 . for a finite spin orbit interaction ( @xmath273 )",
    "we observe a spin splitting of icdv , meaning that the pulse induces temporally and locally a finite spin polarization @xmath274 , even though the system is initially paramagnetic .",
    "the time integral of the pulse - induced , local spin polarization vanishes however .",
    "technically , we infer that the soi results in a su(2 ) flux that produces opposite phase shifts on the azimuthal angle with the same magnitude for a zero - static magnetic field , i.e. @xmath275 .",
    "these shifts cause a rotation around the ring of the symmetry axes of the spin - up and the spin - down densities respectively clockwise and anticlockwise ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . when @xmath248 ( @xmath195 ) , the up and down icdv merge into one curve after one period .",
    "the periodic rotation is subject to the condition @xmath195 .",
    "the spin - averaged icdv , i.e. @xmath276 , is always symmetric with respect to @xmath129 axis . at @xmath272 and",
    "@xmath277 icdv is spin - degenerate for all times ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the spin - resolved icdv is depicted in fig .",
    "the symmetry axes of the pulse - induced spin - up and spin - down icdv rotate around the ring respectively anticlockwise and clockwise with time ( which is the opposite behaviour when increasing soi ) .",
    "accordingly the total icdv oscillates along the @xmath129 axis and possesses a left - right symmetry with respect @xmath129 . the local and temporal spin polarization @xmath279 is symmetric to @xmath280 axis and oscillates along it with the same frequency as @xmath281 ( or @xmath281 ) .",
    "in summary , we investigated the dynamical response of a quantum ring with spin - orbit interaction upon the application of a linearly polarized time - asymmetric weak electromagnetic pulse .",
    "it is found that the dipole moment along the pulse polarization axis is spin degenerate when there is no external magnetic field .",
    "the dipole moment oscillates with time and the soi provides an envelope function or shifts of the oscillation frequencies of dipole moment .",
    "stronger pulse fields can excite higher and lower harmonics .",
    "and the envelope functions for different parity of the occupation number on the ring are different .",
    "when a static external magnetic field is applied , the spin degeneracy is removed .",
    "the spatial and temporal dependence of the pulse induced charge - density variation ( icdv ) indicates that the soi results in a su(2 ) flux leading to a splitting of the phases of the up and down spins states .",
    "the symmetric axes of the icdv for the up and down spins are rotated equally in clockwise and anticlockwise when increasing soi .",
    "the total icdv and the local and temporal polarization of the charge density are symmetric to respectively the light polarization axis and the axis perpendicular .",
    "the pulse - induced polarization is experimentally accessible by measuring the power spectrum of the emitted radiation .",
