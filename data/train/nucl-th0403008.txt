    "in a recent article , kopeliovich  @xcite has discussed the case of nuclear geometry calculations for detectors that are not fully sensitive to the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) cross section , i.e. those with limited acceptance .",
    "he suggests that the nuclear geometry ( glauber ) calculation should be done using different inelastic n - n cross sections according to whether or not the detector is sensitive to inelastic n - n diffractive processes . explicitly , kopeliovich suggests to use the n - n non - diffractive cross section , which he estimates to be 30 mb , in the nuclear geometry calculation for the phobos and phenix detectors , instead of the 42 mb total inelastic n - n cross section used by both experiments .",
    "@xcite the general practice by experimentalists is to use the total inelastic n - n cross section in the nuclear geometry calculation and then correct for the limited phase - space coverage ( the acceptance ) at the detector level  @xcite .",
    "this practice is based primarily on the fact that the nuclear geometry calculation is then the same for all experiments and so can be easily compared .",
    "secondly , in the case of fixed target experiments , the number of projectile participants , a key nuclear geometry parameter , can be directly measured using a zero degree calorimeter .",
    "@xcite thirdly , all experiments have acceptance effects which must be corrected in any case .",
    "the issue of non - diffractive versus total inelastic n - n cross section is relevant to the definition of projectile participants which can be directly measured using zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) .",
    "the solid angle of the zdc is set to a very small forward cone around the beam direction @xmath0 , so as to detect only projectile spectators .",
    "the ideal aperture would allow the zdc to measure the full kinetic energy of a projectile nucleon in the case of no interaction , and to measure zero energy for any nucleon in the projectile that suffered an inelastic collision , including diffraction dissociation .",
    "any inelastic interaction , including diffraction excitation , which causes a projectile nucleon to acquire transverse momentum and lose energy , moves it out of the ideal zdc aperture .",
    "thus , the energy recorded in the zdc is proportional to the number of non - interacting nucleons ( `` spectators '' ) in the projectile , so that the number of nucleons which have interacted ( `` projectile participants '' ) is straightforwardly deduced .",
    "it is important to note that at rhic , the zdc s do not satisfy the ideal criterion and so do not directly measure the number of projectile spectators , hence participants .",
    "nevertheless , it is preferable to keep the nuclear geometry calculations general , in case , for instance , improved zdc s are installed at rhic some time in the future .",
    "furthermore , the use of a common nuclear geometry definition by all four rhic experiments  @xcite has made comparisons among them straightforward and transparent .    an additional argument against adjusting the cross section used in the nuclear geometry calculation to account for the experimental configuration",
    "is that this procedure does not work in general and may , in certain models , give a different answer from the standard method of including the acceptance in the detector response function .",
    "this will be illustrated using examples from extreme - independent models which offer the advantage of explicitly separating the effect of the nuclear geometry from the detector response .",
    "the beauty and utility of having a generally applicable nuclear geometry calculation , rather than one tailored for a particular experiment , is that in the extreme - independent - collision models of b+a nuclear scattering , such as the wounded nucleon model  @xcite and wounded projectile nucleon model  @xcite , the effect of the nuclear geometry of the interaction can be calculated independently of the dynamics of particle production , which can be taken directly from experimental measurements . in these models ,",
    "the nuclear geometry is represented as the relative probability @xmath1 per interaction for a given number @xmath2 of total participants ( wnm ) , projectile participants ( wpnm ) , or other basic elements of particle production such as wounded projectile quarks ( additive quark model  aqm )  @xcite or binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( ncm ) , integrated over the impact parameter of the b+a reaction .",
    "typically , woods - saxon densities are used for both the projectile and target nuclei , and the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section @xmath3 appropriate to the c.m .",
    "energy of the collision is taken . at ags energies ,",
    "30  mb was used ,  @xcite corresponding to a nucleon - nucleon mean free path of @xmath42.2 fm at nuclear density , while at rhic ,",
    "an inelastic n - n cross section of 42  mb is appropriate for @xmath5 gev .",
    "@xcite once the nuclear geometry is specified in this manner , experimental measurements can be used to derive the distribution ( in the actual detector ) of @xmath6 or multiplicity ( or other additive quantity ) for the elementary collision process , i.e. a wounded nucleon ( wnm ) or a wounded projectile nucleon ( wpnm ) , a wounded projectile quark ( aqm ) or an n - n collision ( ncm ) , which is then used as the basis of the analysis of a nuclear scattering as the result of multiple independent elementary collision processes .    to illustrate the effect of the detector acceptance , we use the number of collision model ( ncm ) as an example to calculate an @xmath6 distribution . the ncm calculation for a b+a reaction",
    "is given by the sum : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the inelastic b+a cross section , @xmath1 is the relative probability for @xmath2 binary collisions in the b+a reaction , from 1 to @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the calculated @xmath6 distribution on the detector for @xmath2 independent n - n collisions . if @xmath11 is the measured @xmath6 spectrum on the detector for one detected n - n collision , and @xmath12 is the probability for an n - n collision to produce no signal in the detector , then , the correctly normalized @xmath6 distribution for one n - n collision is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dirac delta function and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath10 ( including the @xmath12 effect ) is obtained by convoluting @xmath16 with itself @xmath17 times @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the @xmath21-th convolution of @xmath11 @xmath22 substituting eq .",

    "@xcite thus , the detected cross section for a b+a reaction is @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the acceptance of the experimental measurement can be accounted for correctly by using the measured n - n cross section in the detector , @xmath29 , to calculate the probability , @xmath12 , that an n - n inelastic collision will produce zero signal on the detector : @xmath30 and then taking @xmath12 into account in the overall detector response .",
    "@xcite the properly normalized equation for 1 n - n collision on the detector is then given by eq .",
    "[ eq : p1 ] and the signal for @xmath2 independent n - n collisions on the detector is given by the binomial distribution eq .",
    "[ eq : ncm2 ] .",
    "thus , the true mean for @xmath2 independent @xmath31 collisions on the detector is : @xmath32 which is @xmath2 times the true mean for 1 n - n collision : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean of the measured @xmath6 distribution for 1 detected n - n collision , the reference distribution .",
    "it is important to contrast eq .",
    "[ eq : meanetn ] with the mean of the @xmath2-th convolution of the observed reference distribution , eq .",

[ eq : meanetn ] ) by a factor of @xmath36 for all @xmath2 .    to summarize , the ncm calculation for a b+a reaction is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ncm ] , which uses the relative probabilities , @xmath1 , for @xmath2 independent n - n collisions calculated with the inelastic n - n cross section , @xmath3 , and takes into account the fraction of inelastic n - n collisions , @xmath12 , which produce no signal on the detector , by correcting the response function , @xmath10 , eq .",
    "[ eq : ncm2 ] .",
    "the result is identical to eq .",
    "[ eq : ncm3 ] , which is the sum over convolutions of the uncorrected spectrum for @xmath21 independent detected n - n collisions .",
    "the correction for the effect of @xmath12 appears in @xmath37 ( eq .  [ eq : ncm4 ] ) , which are thus the relative probabilities for @xmath21 independent detected n - n collisions .",
    "@xcite it is important call attention to a key point of this section : if instead of correcting for the acceptance at the detector level , the correction is made by adjusting the input cross section of the nuclear geometry calculation  @xcite , then the @xmath37 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ncm4 ] should correspond to a glauber calculation with @xmath38 .      in the typical static or glauber monte carlo calculation  @xcite",
    "used to calculate the distribution @xmath1 of binary n - n collisions , a collision is defined when two nucleons pass within a distance @xmath39 from each other .",
    "for any impact parameter @xmath40 the number of collisions for a given nuclear configuration is calculated and the distribution in the number of collisions is obtained by integrating over all impact parameters . if the distribution @xmath1 is first calculated for a cross section @xmath3 , then if a smaller cross section , e.g. @xmath38 , is relevant , the probability for @xmath41 collisions with cross section @xmath29 , given @xmath2 collisions with cross section @xmath3 , is given by the binomial expansion : @xmath42 _ to the extent that the collisions are statistically independent_. the new probability distribution @xmath43 for @xmath41 collisions is obtained by summing over all @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xmath46 or , @xmath47    since the relative probability @xmath1 of @xmath2 collisions with cross section @xmath3 is normalized : @xmath48 it is easy to see that @xmath49 are also normalized , which follows by reversing the indices @xmath41 and @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ eq : wprnorm ] :    @xmath50    @xmath51    clearly the @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ eq : wmindep2 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : ncm4 ] are identical .",
    "this proves that where the probability for a collision is proportional to the cross section in question , and when the probabilities for individual inelastic collisions are independent , that the same result for the extreme independent calculation of the @xmath6 distribution in the ncm model for a b+a reaction is obtained whether the detector response per collision is corrected for the probability @xmath12 of recording zero signal for an inelastic collision , or when the actual measured cross section in the detector is used in the calculation of the nuclear geometry .",
    "this condition may also apply for the aqm , and a specific example of the aqm with the detected cross section used in the nuclear geometry calculation has been given in the literature  @xcite for @xmath52 collisions at the cern - isr .",
    "@xcite    however , the conditions of statistical independence and linearity of the number of elementary  collisions \" with cross section do not apply for the cases of the wounded nucleon model or the wounded projectile nucleon model .",
    "this is shown for the wnm in fig .",
    "[ fig : wnm ] , where @xmath1 calculated with either 42 mb or 30 mb does not change except for the most central collisions , where there is a slight difference ",
    "this is rather different from the combinatorial suppression factor that appears in the correct computation of @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : ncm3],[eq : ncm4 ] ) .",
    "similar logic applies to the wpnm calculation , where the number of projectile nucleons struck by a target nucleus @xmath55 , with a slightly different p - a cross section , would hardly change for central collisions , and then only for nucleons near the periphery .",
    "one may question even for the number of collision model whether the condition for independence of collisions applies . in the glauber model , an individual nucleon in a projectile nucleus",
    "is defined to strike nucleons in the target nucleus when the nucleons in the target are found within a distance @xmath39 from the line of the projectile trajectory . in a glauber monte carlo calculation",
    ", the randomness of assembling nucleons into a target nucleus with a density 0.16 @xmath56 ( following a woods - saxon distribution  @xcite ) assures the randomness of the number of target nucleons in a cylinder of radius 1.16fm ( 0.98fm ) corresponding to @xmath57 mb ( 30 mb ) .",
    "thus the probability to find a nucleon in its spot of phase space in the cylinder ( i.e. the probability for a binary collision ) for a p+a interaction at a given impact parameter is random so the collisions are independent .",
    "however , for a b+a reaction , as the impact parameter varies , the total number of nucleons involved varies in a correlated manner : the more central the interaction , the larger the number of nucleons that can make binary collisions .",
    "thus , the number of binary collisions is not fully random because each of the nucleons participating tends to make more or fewer binary collisions depending on the impact parameter .",
    "thus , the distribution in @xmath1 is not binomial for b+a interactions . nevertheless , statistical independence is not unreasonable for the change in probability corresponding to the change in radius of 0.18fm , which is much smaller than the random variation of the number of target nucleons along a given projectile trajectory , so the binomial distribution for the change in the number of collisions with the change in cross section , eq .",
    "[ eq : pmn ] , is probably correct .",
    "we have demonstrated that the use of the experimentally detected cross section in the nuclear geometry ( glauber ) calculation is valid in certain classes of models but does not work in general .",
    "the procedure which always works  @xcite is to perform the nuclear geometry calculation with the inelastic n - n cross section and correct the detector response for the probability of measuring zero for an inelastic collision or other fundamental element of particle production .",
