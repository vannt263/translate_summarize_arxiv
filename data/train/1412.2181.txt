    "with rapid growth in the use of the internet and wireless services , the challenge to support generalized mobility and provision of ubiquitous services to users while integrating diverse access technologies ( gsm , 3 g , 4 g , wlan , wimax and bluetooth ) , has attracted research attention . due to increased demand for mobile data , users now require access networks that use multiple layers ( macro as well as micro cells ) , and multiple technologies to meet growing needs . as a mobile node ( mn ) moves within a heterogenous environment ,",
    "satisfactory quality of service ( qos ) is desired by ensuring efficient vertical handover .",
    "vertical handover can be defined as when an mn moves from one access network to another type of access network while maintaining the live call or session .",
    "in contrast to horizontal handovers , vertical handovers can be instigated for convenience rather than connectivity purposes  @xcite .",
    "as such , the choice to perform vertical handover may depend on factors such as available bandwidth , received signal strength ( rss ) , access cost , dwell time , security , speed , etc . @xcite . for optimal decision making ,",
    "it is imperative to weigh the benefits against the detriments before initiating a vertical handover .",
    "related works on vertical handover can be grouped into three types @xcite , the rss - based , cost - based and other related works which are briefly described .    _ * rss - based related works * _ : : :    several rss - based handover algorithms have been developed for wireless    communications .",
    "a novel algorithm was developed using the concept of    dynamic boundary area to support seamless vertical handover between    the 3 g and wlan in @xcite .",
    "a traveling distance prediction based    handover decision method @xcite , dwell time prediction model @xcite    and a linear approximation of the travelled distance @xcite were    proposed to minimize the probability of unnecessary handover .",
    "however ,    the geometric models considered were not of a realistic coverage cell    shape .",
    "_ * cost - based related works * _ : : :    handover cost is a function of the available bandwidth , security ,    power consumption and the monetary cost @xcite . as the need for voice    and video services rise , available",
    "bandwidth , power consumption ,    security , etc .",
    ", will be the major factors to indicate network    conditions and determination of triggering the handovers . in @xcite ,    available bandwidth and monetary cost were used as metrics for    handover decisions .",
    "cost - based algorithms are usually complex as they    require collecting and normalization of different network metrics .",
    "_ * other related works * _ : : :    an analytical framework to evaluate vertical handover algorithms with    new extensions for traditional hysteresis based and dwell timer - based    algorithms was proposed in @xcite . using probability approach ,",
    "@xcite worked on the assessment of a wrong decision probability    ( wdp ) , which assures a trade - off between network performance    maximization and mitigation of the ping - pong effect .",
    "the proposed    algorithm was able to reduce the vertical handover frequency , thus    minimizing the unnecessary handovers and maximizing the throughput by    keeping the received bits as high as possible .",
    "the focus of this paper is to introduce an amoebic based geometric model that extends the ideal circular coverage model employed in previous works .",
    "the work considers the rss - based dwell time approach .",
    "rss - based algorithms are easy to implement , however , these algorithms are seriously limited by slow fading @xcite .",
    "slow fading can be caused by events such as shadowing , where a large obstruction obscures the main signal path between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "this paper presents a novel and realistic model that depicts the actual behaviour of a wlan coverage area , considering the effects of slow fading .",
    "the proposed model will ensure an efficient minimization of the probability of unnecessary handover and handover failure for an mn traversing a realistic wlan cell from a 3 g network by the following factors :    * the wlan cell shape is not exactly circular , but irregular .",
    "* the cell shape changes with changes in nature of obstruction at different instances , humidity , temperature etc .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec:2 ] describes the amoebic wireless coverage concept .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] presents the geometric and probabilistic analysis of the proposed amoebic - based dwell time model .",
    "the handover decision is specified in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] evaluates the performance of the proposed model and compares the results with those of other approaches .",
    "section [ sec:6 ] draws conclusions .",
    "both theoretical and empirical propagation models show that average received signal power decreases logarithmically with distance . , + where  @xmath0 is the gaussian random variable with standard deviation ,  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 is the path loss exponent .",
    "] there exist a number of factors , apart from the frequency and the distance that influence losses encountered by propagated signals from the ap to the mn . in order to accurately model a wireless coverage area",
    "the factors that must be considered are :    * the height of the mn antenna ; * the height of the ap relative to the surrounding terrain ; * the terrain irregularity ( undulation or roughness ) ; * the land usage in the surroundings of mn : urban , suburban , rural , open , etc",
    ".    due to these effects the coverage region does not remain circular , but of an irregular shape and this shape also changes with time  thus we called it amoebic shaped coverage region .",
    "this paper presents an amoebic wlan cell which gives a realistic representation of the wireless coverage with a perspective of the shadowing concept .",
    "there are three different rates of variation as wireless signals are propagated away from the ap : we have ( i ) the very slow variation , called path loss , which is a function of distance between the ap and mn , ( ii ) slow variation , which results from shadowing effects , and ( iii ) fast variation , due to multipath .",
    "signal variations caused by multipath , in the case where the direct signal is assumed to be totally blocked , are usually represented by a rayleigh distribution@xcite .",
    "the slow received signal variability due to shadowing is usually assumed to follow a gaussian distribution  @xcite .",
    "this paper considers the effect of the path loss and shadowing .",
    "the effect of multipath is neglected and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "[ fig:1 ] gives a clearer picture of the behavior of wireless signals in a coverage area with coverage probabilities of 90% , 80% and 50% .",
    "when an mn moves along contours as shown in fig .",

    "the work assumes that when an mn is in the coverage area of it s present access network , adjacent to a wlan cell , it may enter the boundary area of the wlan cell at any point ,  @xmath17 and move along the path  @xmath18 , making exit from any point ,  @xmath19 on the coverage boundary ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the speed ,  @xmath20 of the mn is uniformly distributed in  @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the cell radius is assumed to be stochastic and normally ( gaussian ) distributed with defined mean and variance .",
    "the justification for having a normal distribution can be given in terms of the central limit theorem and variance ,  @xmath22 , the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a gaussian distribution with mean ,  @xmath4 and variance ,  @xmath23 , where  @xmath24 is the number of samples . ]",
    "@xcite , as the total attenuation experienced in a wireless link results from the tallying of several individual shadowing processes forming a gaussian distribution .",

    "a realistic coverage area of the wlan cell with an amoebic structure is considered in this work . as there is only a possibility that the mn moves in and out of the coverage area in any half section of fig .",
