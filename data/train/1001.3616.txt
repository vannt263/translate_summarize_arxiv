    "escape from a metastable state underlies a broad range of phenomena , chemical reactions , diffusion in solids , and population extinction being examples . a classical theory of escape was first developed by kramers @xcite . for a brownian particle in a potential",
    "well , see fig .",
    "[ fig : metastable_potential ] , he obtained the escape rate @xmath0 in the form @xmath1 and found the prefactor @xmath2 in a broad parameter range .",
    "the understanding of the prefactor is important not only for completeness of a theory of escape , but also for interpreting the experiment , cf . refs .",
    "therefore much effort has been put into extending the kramers theory , see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "most of the obtained results refer to generalizations of the kramers model to other types of brownian motion , for example , to brownian motion in a three - dimensional potential @xcite or a periodically modulated potential @xcite .    .",
    "in the time range @xmath3 the probability current from the metastable state @xmath4 is independent of time and the escape rate @xmath5 @xcite . the probability distribution for poisson noise",
    "is found by matching the asymptotic solutions in regions @xmath6 . ,",
    "width=192 ]    in the last few years escape from a metastable state has attracted much interest as a means of detecting non - gaussian noise and potentially determining its statistics @xcite .",
    "the proposed noise detectors are continuous systems ; in the experiment there have been used josephson junctions @xcite and nanomechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "it is important therefore to have a full theory of escape induced by non - gaussian noise , which will include both the exponent and the prefactor in the escape rate .    in this paper",
    "we study the probability distribution and escape induced by poisson noise .",
    "such noise is often encountered in photon statistics and in the statistics of current through tunnel junctions .",
    "the noise can be far from the gaussian limit , which happens if the noise pulses are infrequent , with the rate of the order of the reciprocal relaxation time of the system in the absence of noise @xmath7 ( a more precise condition is specified later ) .",
    "this parameter range was studied in the experiment @xcite in particular . in the opposite limit of frequent small pulses",
    "the noise becomes close to gaussian .",
    "this range is often of interest for experiments with josephson junctions .",
    "the random motion of the system is very different depending on whether the system has time to relax between the pulses or they are too close in time to change the state between them . respectively , the probability distributions of the system have very different shapes and the expressions for the escape rate have very different structures . at the same time , in the both cases the noise has the same statistics .",
    "one might expect therefore that the noise - induced fluctuations can be studied within a single approach that would apply for an arbitrary pulse rate .",
    "developing such an approach and demonstrating how the fluctuations change from the well - understood gaussian limit to the opposite limit of well - separated pulses , along with the escape problem , provide the major motivation for this paper .",
    "we model the system by a particle in a potential well , with the local minimum of the potential corresponding to the metastable state in the absence of noise , see fig .",
    "[ fig : metastable_potential ] .",
    "escape occurs if a sufficiently large outburst of noise drives the particle over the potential barrier .",
    "we further assume that the particle is overdamped , it has no inertia . for infrequent noise pulses",
    "the probability distribution is singular in this case @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the kramers approach can not be applied and a different technique has to be used .",
    "our analysis is based on the kinetic equation .",
    "we develop an asymptotic method of solving this equation in the case where the poisson noise is weak on average , so that escape is a rare event , the escape rate @xmath8 .",
    "this technique applies for an arbitrary relation between the two parameters that characterize a poisson noise , the appropriately scaled noise intensity and pulse rate .",
    "we find the probability distribution near the minimum of the potential well ( point @xmath9 in fig .  [",
    "fig : metastable_potential ] ) and near the top of the potential barrier ( point @xmath10 ) as integral transforms of different types .",
    "the obtained expressions are then matched to the distribution in the intermediate range , which is found using the wkb - type approximation .",
    "this gives the full probability distribution , and both the exponent and the prefactor in @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of an overdamped particle , with coordinate @xmath11 , driven by a poisson noise @xmath12 is described by the langevin equation @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is a metastable potential . in the absence of noise",
    ", the particle has a stable state at the local potential minimum @xmath9 and an unstable stationary state at the local maximum @xmath10 , see fig .",

    "the characteristic relaxation time is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "an important class of systems described by an overdamped one - dimensional particle in a metastable potential are systems near bifurcation points .",
    "their dynamics display model - independent features , and their noise - induced switching has found applications in various areas of physics , see ref .",

    "the parameter @xmath19 is small , which means that many pulses are required for pushing the particle over the barrier , @xmath21 we note that @xmath22 is not necessarily the largest parameter of the theory , i.e. , the scaled area of the noise pulses , even though it is small , is not necessarily the smallest parameter .",
    "the noise - driven dynamics very strongly depend on the average rate @xmath23 at which the noise pulses are repeated .",
    "if @xmath24 is not large , the discreteness of the pulses is of primary importance , the state of the system changes between the pulses when they come at the average rate . on the other hand , in the limit of high mean pulse rate , @xmath25 ,",
    "the noise is effectively a white gaussian noise with intensity @xmath26 .    for a high pulse rate",
    ", @xmath27 does not have to be small , it can exceed the characteristic dynamical force @xmath28 even for small @xmath17 . on physical grounds ,",
    "we incorporate the average bias from the noise @xmath29 into the potential @xmath14 and study fluctuations induced by the deviations from the mean , i.e. , by a zero - mean random force @xmath30 .",
    "there is a similarity between poisson - noise driven dynamical systems and reaction systems .",
    "the latter are characterized by a large but finite number of elementary units , for example , molecules in a stirred chemical reactor or individuals in a population .",
    "the dynamics is controlled by reactions between them .",
    "the elementary reactions are short events , which are uncorrelated with each other and are characterized by rates ; these events present a poisson process . a system may have a metastable state , which is approached as a result of the most probable reaction sequence .",
    "however , an unlikely yet possible reaction sequence can drive the system far away from this state , leading to switching to a different stable state . for one - species reaction systems , the prefactor in the escape rate",
    "can be studied using the kramers technique @xcite ( the prefactor in the probability distribution was missed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as in reaction systems , in our system",
    "the noise leads to a finite increment of the system coordinate .",
    "however , our system is continuous , and in addition it is subject to a regular force @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to a qualitative distinction of the escape problem from that in reaction systems and to the aforementioned inapplicability of the kramers technique .",
    "we will study escape using the kinetic equation for the probability distribution of the system @xmath32 .",
