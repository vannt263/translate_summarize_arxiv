    "similarly we regard the other @xmath41 vertical strands as @xmath40-sticks lying on @xmath27-level 2 and @xmath37-levels @xmath42 .",
    "now connect each pair of an @xmath37-stick and a @xmath40-stick , which came from adjacent strands in the grid diagram , by a @xmath27-edge whose boundary lies on @xmath27-levels 1 and 2 .",
    "we finally get a lattice presentation of @xmath1 as shown in the leftmost of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "now we count the number of edges . by the definition of the grid diagram , there are exactly two @xmath37-edges each between @xmath37-levels 1 and 2 , and between @xmath37-levels @xmath43 and @xmath41 , four @xmath37-edges each between @xmath37-levels 2 and 3 , and between @xmath37-levels @xmath44 and @xmath43 , and so on .",

    "any stick does not pass another but only some @xmath37-sticks can be overlapped . to get a proper lattice presentation , remove such all overlapped @xmath37-edges which are expressed by dotted line segments in the last figure .",
    "note that almost half of @xmath40-sticks which are on the right side in the leftmost figure moved into @xmath27-level 0 and all @xmath37-sticks stayed on @xmath27-level 1 .",
    "this movement does not change the knot type of @xmath1 .",
    "[ h ]     again we count the number of edges .",
    "note that the numbers of @xmath40-edges and @xmath27-edges are unchanged .",
    "if @xmath41 is odd , then each @xmath37-level @xmath54 contains exactly two @xmath40-sticks and @xmath37-level @xmath55 contains one @xmath40-stick .",
    "this means that there are four @xmath37-edges between @xmath37-levels 1 and 2 , at most eight @xmath37-edges between @xmath37-levels 2 and 3 , and so on .",
    "similarly there are two @xmath37-edges between @xmath37-levels @xmath56 and @xmath55 , at most six @xmath37-edges between @xmath37-levels @xmath57 and @xmath56 , and so on .",
    "keep counting until we reach the middle level .",
    "then the maximum number of @xmath37-edges is @xmath58 .",
    "moreover we can reduce two more @xmath27-edges in @xmath37-level @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath41 is even , then each @xmath37-level @xmath59 contains two @xmath40-sticks and each @xmath37-level 1 and @xmath60 contains one @xmath40-stick .",
    "thus there are two @xmath37-edges each between @xmath37-levels 1 and 2 , and between @xmath37-levels @xmath61 and @xmath60 , at most six @xmath37-edges each between @xmath37-levels 2 and 3 , and between @xmath37-levels @xmath62 and @xmath61 , and so on .",
    "then the maximum number of @xmath37-edges is @xmath63 if @xmath60 is odd , or @xmath64 if @xmath60 is even .",
    "moreover we can reduce two @xmath27-edges each in @xmath37-levels 1 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the maximum number of edges of this new lattice presentation is @xmath65 if @xmath41 is odd , @xmath66 if @xmath67 for some positive integer @xmath68 , or @xmath69 if @xmath70 .",
    "so we have the following inequality :    @xmath71    * step 3 . *",
    "_ vertical folding to reduce one eighth of the square growth . _",
    "we fold again the new lattice presentation structure along the line @xmath72 , @xmath73 if @xmath41 is odd , and @xmath72 , @xmath74 if @xmath41 is even as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "when we fold , all @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 2 stayed on the same @xmath27-level , upper half of @xmath37-sticks on @xmath27-level 1 moved into @xmath27-level 3 and the rest half stayed on @xmath27-level 1 , and upper half of @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 0 moved into @xmath27-level 4 and the rest half stayed on @xmath27-level 0 . during this folding argument , a stick does not pass another , only some of @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 2 are overlapped , and some of @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 0 are broken into two pieces . to get a proper lattice presentation , remove such all overlapped @xmath40-edges , and connect each pair of the broken @xmath40-sticks by two @xmath40-edges and four @xmath27-edges as shown in the last figure in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "still this movement does not change the knot type of @xmath1 .",
    "[ h ]     in this step , counting the number of edges is more complicated .",
    "first consider the @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 2 which are at least half among @xmath41 @xmath40-sticks . indeed",
    ", the exact number of such @xmath40-sticks is @xmath55 for odd @xmath41 case , and @xmath60 for even @xmath41 case .",
    "folding these @xmath40-sticks is exactly in the same way as folding @xmath37-sticks in step 2 .",
    "when we fold @xmath37-sticks in step 2 , the maximum number of @xmath37-edges decreases by almost half as follows : @xmath75 replaced by @xmath76 for odd @xmath41 , @xmath77 replaced by @xmath78 for @xmath67 , and @xmath77 replaced by @xmath79 for @xmath70 .",
    "so we can apply this calculation to the above half class of @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 2 .",
    "more precisely the decrease by almost half is guaranteed when we fold all @xmath40-sticks as proceeded in step 2 .",
    "but we can surely apply this argument to either the set of almost half @xmath40-sticks on the left side or the set of almost half @xmath40-sticks on the right side in the first figure in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we may assume that the above half class of @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-level 2 fits this condition .",
    "note that for the other half class of @xmath40-sticks on @xmath27-levels 0 and 4 , we add two more @xmath40-edges and four more @xmath27-edges to connect each pair after broken",
    ". then the maximum number of @xmath40-edges is @xmath80 for odd @xmath41 case , @xmath81 for @xmath67 case , and @xmath82 for @xmath70 case .    after counting the @xmath27-sticks used to connect each pair of the broken @xmath40-sticks ,",
    "the maximum number of @xmath27-edges in total is @xmath83 for odd @xmath41 , and @xmath84 for even @xmath41 , while the number of @xmath37-edges are unchanged from step 2 .",
    "therefore the maximum number of edges of the final lattice presentation is @xmath85 if @xmath41 is odd , @xmath86 if @xmath67 , or @xmath87 if @xmath70 .",
    "we have the following inequality :    @xmath88    * step 4 .",
    "* _ apply proposition [ prop : grid ] to complete the proof of theorem [ thm : len ] .",
    "_    since we can take any upper bounds of step 1 , 2 and 3 , we finally get :    @xmath89    now apply proposition [ prop : grid ] to complete the proof of theorem [ thm : len ] .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm : rop ] . since a lattice knot can be changed to a smooth knot by taking a twice enlargement and replacing every corner with a suitable quartile circle as illustrated in figure [ fig5 ] .",
