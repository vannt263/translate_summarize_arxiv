    "the information relative to the structure of the electromagnetic transitions between the nucleon and the nucleon excitations ( @xmath15 ) has been parametrized using different forms  @xcite . the representations in terms of helicity amplitudes , longitudinal and transverse , can be defined independently of the proprieties of the resonances . in alternative , one can use a representation in terms of structure form factors , that emphasize precisely the symmetries associated with the nucleon resonances .",
    "the helicity amplitudes and the structure form factors are function of the transition four - momentum transfer ( @xmath16 ) squared , @xmath17 , but are often represented in terms of @xmath18 , particularly in nucleon electroexcitation reactions ( @xmath19 ) . in general",
    "the different helicity amplitudes are independent functions , except in some specific limits .",
    "the same holds for the form factors .    taking the case of the nucleon as example : the electric and the magnetic form factors , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are independent functions , except in the threshold limit @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( threshold of the @xmath24 reaction ) . in the case of the @xmath15 transitions , there are constraints between helicity amplitudes , or between form factors , at the pseudo - threshold limit .",

    "the condition that expresses the relation between different amplitudes ( or form factors ) at the pseudo - threshold is usually refereed as the siegert s theorem . the siegert s theorem was introduced first in studies related with nuclear physics  @xcite and was later used in pion electroproduction reactions  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study in particular the constraints of the siegert s theorem in the @xmath0 transition , where @xmath10 is a spin @xmath28 state with negative parity ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we will show in particular that some parametrizations of the @xmath0 transition amplitudes , like the maid2007 parametrization  @xcite , are not consistent with the siegert s theorem . in order to grant that the siegert s theorem is valid",

    "the consequences of the siegert s theorem for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 helicity amplitudes are discussed in a separated article  @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of the current associated with a transition between the nucleon ( state @xmath33 ) and a @xmath34 resonance can be represented in terms of two form factors , @xmath35 and @xmath36 according with ref .",

    "@xmath30 , the factor @xmath43 is interpreted as the limit @xmath8 .",
    "this point is important since it is assumed that @xmath11 and @xmath43 have the same order in @xmath5 , for small values of @xmath5 .",
    "the consequence of this observation is that if @xmath44 , meaning that @xmath11 converges to a constant in the pseudo - threshold limit , one can write also @xmath45 , near @xmath46 .    in this article , we will assume then , that , the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 behave , near the pseudo - threshold , as a_1/2 = o(1 ) , s_1/2 = o(|*q*| ) .",

    "the orthogonality between states at the pseudo - threshold generalizes the nonrelativistic definition of orthogonality between states with different masses when the recoil ( and the mass difference ) is neglected ( @xmath60 ) .    since the amplitude @xmath12 can also be defined by @xmath47 , assuming current conservation can be calculated using the operator @xmath61 , as in eq .",
