    "the composition of the short - duration , hard - spectrum gamma - ray burst ( grb ) population is not yet fully understood .",
    "it is believed that most of the bursts are generated in compact binary mergers @xcite and while the handful of optical counterparts and host galaxies discovered to date does not contradict this view , it is also thought that the population probably contains up to 8% extragalactic giant magnetar flares as well @xcite . for the majority of the short - duration grb population , however , there is simply not enough evidence to determine their origin unambiguously . hawking radiation from primordial black holes ( hereafter pbh ) was one of the very first explanations proposed for cosmic gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and it continues to be proposed today @xcite . the pbh lifetime and burst duration depend on its mass , so pbhs bursting today have similar masses and durations , and release similar energies , making them in essence ` standard candles ' .",
    "the typical pbh gamma - ray burst is not expected to be accompanied by detectable intrinsically - generated extended emission or have an afterglow , although accompanying bursts at other wavelengths or afterglows may arise if , for example , the pbh is embedded in a high density magnetic field or plasma @xcite . in the standard emission scenario , so - called because it uses the standard model of particle physics @xcite , the pbh gamma - ray burst is strongest in the final second of the burst lifetime , has a hard energy spectrum , and should be detectable in the vicinity of the earth . for a typical interplanetary network detector sensitive to bursts of fluence",
    "10@xmath3 erg @xmath4 and above , pbh events could in principle be detected out to a distance of a few parsecs , depending on the emission model .",
    "pbhs evaporating today do not have enough luminosity to be detected at cosmological distances even by the most sensitive current instruments , so searching for them locally is a logical step .    when observed by a single detector",
    ", the properties of a pbh burst might not appear to be significantly different from those of other short bursts ; instruments with localization or imaging capabilities would obtain their arrival directions as they would for an infinitely distant source .",
    "indeed many attempts to find evidence for the existence of pbh bursts have to date been based mainly on the spatial distribution and time histories of a subset of short bursts @xcite .",
    "other search methods have employed atmospheric cherenkov detectors @xcite , air shower detectors @xcite , radio pulse detection @xcite , spark chamber detection @xcite , and grb femtolensing @xcite .",
    "table  [ comparison ] gives a comparison of these various methods .",
    "to widely spaced interplanetary network ( ipn ) detectors , however , a local pbh burst could look significantly different when compared with bursts from distant sources , due to the curvature of the received wavefront . in this paper",
    ", we use this fact to explore the possibility that some short bursts may originate in the solar neighborhood , and estimate lower limits to the pbh burst evaporation rate assuming these bursts are real pbh bursts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ blackhole ]",
    "we derive the fluence expected in the detector from a pbh burst using the standard emission model and , as a maximal alternative , the hagedorn emission model . in section [ methodology ]",
    "we explain how we localized the detected bursts in 3d relaxing the assumption that they are at infinite distances .",
    "the detailed discussion of the methodology is given in appendix a. our data selection criteria are described in section  [ data_selection ] . our results and pbh burst rate limit calculation are given in section  [ results ] . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss implications and limitations of our results .",
    "as a pbh hawking - radiates , its mass is decreased by the total energy carried off by the emission , and the black hole temperature , which is inversely proportional to its mass , increases . in the standard emission model ( sem )",
    "@xcite , the black hole directly hawking - radiates those particles which appear fundamental on the scale of the black hole .",
    "once the black hole temperature reaches the qcd transition scale ( @xmath5 mev ) , quarks and gluons are directly hawking - radiated .",
    "the pbh gamma - ray burst spectrum is the combination of the directly hawking - radiated photons and those produced by the decay of other directly hawking - radiated particles .",
    "an sem pbh with a remaining emission lifetime of @xmath6 sec has a mass of @xmath7 @xcite and a remaining rest mass energy of @xmath8 the expected fluence arriving at the detector from a pbh at a distance @xmath9 from earth is then @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the fraction of the pbh energy that arrives in the energy band of the detector , and the maximum distance from which the sem pbh is detectable is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "the sem analysis is consistent with high energy accelerator experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , an alternative class of pbh evaporation models was proposed before the existence of quarks and gluons was confirmed in accelerator experiments and these models continue to be discussed in the pbh burst literature . in such models ( which we label hm scenarios ) ,",
    "a hagedorn - type exponentially increasing number of degrees of freedom become available as radiation modes once the black hole temperature reaches a specific threshold such as the qcd transition scale . in the hm scenarios ,",
    "we assume that the remaining pbh mass is emitted quasi - instantaneously as a burst of energy @xmath15 once the black hole mass reaches some threshold @xmath16 ; for the qcd transition scale , @xmath17 g and @xmath18 erg .",
    "proceeding as above , the maximum distance from which the hm pbh burst is detectable is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fraction of the hm pbh energy that arrives in the energy band of the detector .",
    "when a pair of ipn spacecraft detects a burst , if the distance to the source is taken to be a free parameter , the event is localized to one sheet of a hyperboloid of revolution about the axis defined by the line between the spacecraft .",
    "if the burst is assumed to be at a distance which is much greater than the interspacecraft distance , the hyperboloid intersects the celestial sphere to form the usual localization circle ( or annulus , when uncertainties are taken into account ) .",
    "another widely spaced spacecraft would produces a second hyperboloid which intersects the first one to define a locus of points which is a simple hyperbola .",
    "note that both hyperboloids have a common focus .",
    "again , if the burst is assumed to be at a large distance from the spacecraft , the hyperbola intersects the celestial sphere at two points to define two possible error boxes . a fourth , non - coplanar spacecraft even at a moderate distance from earth , such as _ konus - wind , can often be used to eliminate one branch of the hyperbola and part of the second branch . a terrestrial analogue to this method is time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) , with the important exception that grb sources can be at distances which are effectively infinite .",
    "further details are given in appendix a. while a single instrument with imaging or localization capability would obtain the correct sky position for a pbh burst regardless of its distance , the same is not true of an ipn localization , for which the derived arrival direction depends on the source distance .",
    "_    in this paper , we relax the assumption that bursts are at infinite distances .",
    "if a burst is detected by three widely spaced spacecraft , then according to the previous discussion , the possible location of the burst traces a simple hyperbola in space as illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure3 ] . in an earth - centered coordinate system",
    ", this hyperbola has a closest distance to the earth , that is , a distance lower limit . as we explain in section  [ ul_estimate ] , this fact can be used to calculate a lower limit to the pbh burst density rate in the solar neighborhood assuming that the bursts that we consider are actual pbh bursts . in principle , detections by three spacecraft can rule out a local origin for a burst , but it is impossible to prove a local origin with only three non - imaging spacecraft .    in the case",
    "where a burst is observed by four widely spaced non - imaging spacecraft , the burst can be localized to a single point in space ( or a region in space if uncertainties are taken into consideration ) .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "thus in order to prove the local origin of a burst using non - imaging spacecraft , one needs detections from at least four satellites that are at interplanetary distances from each other .",
    "as mentioned in appendix a , in the special case of two widely separated spacecraft , where one spacecraft has precise imaging capability , it is in principle possible to demonstrate a local origin .",
    "we have explored this case in detail and defer treatment of it to a future paper .",
    "none of the events in this paper are in that category .",
    "the ipn database contains information on over 25,000 cosmic , solar , and magnetar events which occurred between 1990 and the present ( ` http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/index.html ` ) . during this period , a total of 18 spacecraft participated in the network . some were dedicated grb detectors , while others were primarily gamma - ray detectors with grb detection capability .",
    "indeed , the composition of the ipn changed regularly during this time , as old missions were retired and new ones were launched . however , all the instruments were sensitive to bursts with fluences around @xmath21 or peak fluxes @xmath22 and above , resulting in a roughly constant detection rate .",
    "all known bursts , regardless of their intensity or duration , or the instruments which detected them , are included in this list .",
    "we have searched it for gamma - ray bursts with the following properties .",
    "* confirmed cosmic bursts which occurred between 1990 october and 2014 december ( 24.25 y ; 10795 grbs survived this cut ) . * bursts observed by three or more spacecraft ,",
    "of which two were at interplanetary distances ; 839 grbs survived this cut .",
    "this small number is due firstly to the relatively high sensitivity thresholds of the distant ipn detectors ( roughly @xmath23 ) , and their somewhat coarser time resolutions , and secondly to a 2.5 year period between 1993 august and 1996 february when there was only one interplanetary spacecraft in the network .",
    "* bursts with no x - ray or optical afterglow , either because there were no follow - up observations , or because searches were negative .",
    "in addition , as discussed before , the arrival direction derived from ipn localization depends on its assumed distance , and the bursts were initially triangulated assuming an infinite distance .",
    "thus even if a simultaneous search had taken place , it might not have identified an event within the error box if the burst was local .",
    "other selection effects come into play starting with the launch of the hete spacecraft in 2000 october , and later with the launch of swift in 2004 november , namely that x - ray and optical observations were often done rapidly , leading to more x - ray and optical detections and the elimination of the bursts from further consideration here .",
    "on the other hand , the launches of suzaku in 2005 july and fermi in 2008 june resulted in an increase in the short burst detection rate which more than compensated for the previous effect .",
    "* bursts with durations @xmath24 1 s and no extended emission ( ee ) .",
    "no cut was made based on the light curve shape ; we discuss this in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the detection rate of short bursts was roughly , but not exactly , constant over the period of this study .",
    "these cuts , which are commutative , were carried out in the order described above , so as to minimize the required analysis of the full sample of 10795 events .",
    "36 bursts satisfied these criteria .",
    "none were detected by an imaging instrument with good spatial resolution . while we believe that the overall ipn detection rate of short bursts was roughly constant , the data selection resulted in a rate which varied significantly from year to year .    in order to obtain distance lower limits as described in appendix a , these bursts were triangulated assuming that their distances from earth were free parameters . in all cases , however , an infinite distance was also compatible with the data .",
    "the results appear in table  [ distances ] .    of the 10795 grbs which survived the first cut ,",
    "we would expect roughly 20% , or 2150 , to be short - duration events ( @xmath24 1 s ) . of those , perhaps 10% , or 215 , would display extended emission @xcite , bringing the sample to 1935 non - ee bursts .",
    "we would expect about 80% of them to have no optical counterpart , either because none was detected or none was searched for ( this number applies only to short bursts ) .",
    "this reduces the sample to about 1550 .",
    "since only 36 events survived all the data cuts , we can estimate the average ipn efficiency for this selection procedure to be about 2.3% .",
    "thus if we exclude the 2.5 year period when the ipn had a single interplanetary spacecraft , the observed event rate is 1.7/year , and the true rate is about 72/year .",
    "according the methodology described in section  [ methodology ] and appendix a , we have calculated the minimum possible distances to the sample of 36 bursts selected in section  [ data_selection ] .",
    "this burst sample is shown in table  [ distances ] and the 12 columns give :    1 .",
    "the date of the burst , in ` yymmdd ` format , with suffix a or b where appropriate , 2 .",
    "the universal time of the burst at earth , in seconds of day , 3 .",
    "the spacecraft which were used for the triangulation ; a complete list of the spacecraft which detected the burst may be found on the ipn website ( ` http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/index.html ` ) , 4 .   the burst duration , in seconds , 5 .",
    "the fluence of the burst in erg @xmath4 , 6 .",
    "the energy range over which the duration and fluence were measured , in kev , 7 .",
    "the lower limit to the burst distance , obtained by triangulation , in cm , 8 .",
    "the distance to which this burst could have been detected if it were a pbh burst of energy 10@xmath25 erg , assuming that all the energy went into the measured fluence ( this is essentially the maximum possible detectable distance ) , 9 .   the maximum detectable distance assuming the sem model ( equation  [ eq : semdmax ] ) in terms of the undetermined parameter @xmath26 , 10 .",
    "the maximum detectable distance assuming the hm model ( equation  [ eq : hdmax ] ) in terms of the undetermined parameter @xmath27 , 11 . whether or not counterpart searches took place and if so , their references , 12 .",
    "references to the duration , peak flux , and/or fluence measurements , and/or to the localization .",
    "the shortest burst in table  [ distances ] has a duration of 60 ms . due to",
    "the relatively coarse time resolutions of interplanetary detectors , bursts with shorter durations must have greater intensities to be detected , effectively setting a higher detection threshold for very short events .",
    "the weakest event has a fluence of @xmath28 .",
    "the bursts in table  [ distances ] could not have come from distances less than the distance lower limits in column 7 ; however , all of them have time delays which are also consistent with infinite distances .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbh_min_dist_histo ] shows a histogram of these minimum distances .",
    "the detector - dependent distance upper limits in column 8 are calculated assuming the extreme case that these events are caused by @xmath29 erg hm - type bursts from primordial black holes of mass @xmath30 g and that all of the emitted energy spectrum is contained within the detector measurement limits .",
    "table  [ localizations ] gives the coordinates of the centers and corners of the error boxes for the events in table  [ distances ] , assuming that the sources are at infinity .",
    "if in fact the sources are local , the arrival directions are distance - dependent , and different from the ones in table  [ localizations ] .",
    "these coordinates represent the intersections of annuli , and in some cases the curvature of the annuli would make it inaccurate to construct an error box by connecting the coordinates with straight - line segments .",
    "all previous direct pbh burst searches resulted in null detections @xcite . in this case",
    ", one can derive an upper limit on the local pbh burst rate density , that is , an upper limit on the number of pbh bursts per unit volume per unit time in the local solar neighborhood .",
    "however , in our case , we have pbh burst candidates with short duration , no known afterglow detection and minimum distances that are sub - light - years .",
    "since we have pbh candidates , we should be able to derive an actual measurement of the pbh burst rate density under the assumption that the candidates are actual pbh bursts .",
    "thus , the actual pbh burst rate density is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of pbh bursts , @xmath33 is the effective pbh detectable volume and @xmath34 is the observed duration .",
    "the selection efficiency of the ipn is @xmath35 .",
    "if all the candidates identified in section  [ data_selection ] are real pbh bursts , then we have 36 pbh bursts , i.e. , @xmath3636 .",
    "hence , our pbh burst rate density estimate is , @xmath37    next we need to estimate the values of @xmath34 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 .",
    "because we have studied ipn bursts collected over 21.75 years ( the 2.5 year ipn non  sensitivity period is excluded ) , our observed duration is @xmath34=21.75 years . the effective pbh detectable volume , @xmath33 , calculation for this 21.75 year period , however , is not obvious .",
    "each pbh candidate has a distance consistent with some minimum distance up to infinity .",
    "we also know that pbh bursts are not bright enough to be detected from large distances .",
    "the maximum possible detectable distance of a pbh burst depends on the high - energy physics model used to calculate the final pbh burst spectrum  @xcite .",
    "currently there are no accurate calculations for final pbh burst photon spectra in the kev - mev energy range .",
    "thus as a conservative maximum possible detectable pbh burst distance , we can take the maximum value of the minimum distances in our candidate pbh burst sample .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of 0.47 parsecs ( @xmath38 cm ) . because all the pbh burst candidates in the sample are actual ipn detections , this distance value is model - independent . on the other hand",
    ", it is important to note that the ipn is not capable of detecting all the bursts within this distance over the entire observation duration due to various factors such as the orientation of the satellites , and/or instrument duty cycles .",
    "thus the effective volume calculated from the above maximum possible detectable pbh burst distance is an overestimate .",
    "hence the pbh burst rate calculated in equation  [ pbh_rate_36 ] is in reality a lower limit on the pbh burst rate density , @xmath39    in section  [ data_selection ] , we made a rough estimate of the selection efficiency of ipn , @xmath35 , for pbh bursts .",
    "however , we note that it is very challenging to calculate @xmath35 accurately due to a number of unknown factors such as the fraction of bursts without ee , the fraction of bursts without afterglows , the fraction of bursts to which the ipn is not sensitive ( for example due to orientation or deadtime ) , etc .    using the estimated effective pbh detectable volume @xmath33 ,",
    "observed duration @xmath34 , and selection efficiency @xmath35 , we can now estimate the lower limit of the pbh burst rate in the best case scenario where all the pbh burst candidates are actual pbh bursts . in this case ,",
    "our pbh burst lower limit is @xmath40158.5 bursts @xmath41 .",
    "if we assumed 100% efficiency then the pbh burst lower limit is @xmath40 3.6 bursts @xmath41 .",
    "if only one of the candidates is an actual pbh burst then the value of the rate density lower limit depends on the minimum distance to that particular burst .",
    "if the burst with the largest minimum distance ( grb 140807 ) is the pbh burst , then the pbh burst rate density lower limit is @xmath40 0.1 bursts @xmath41 .",
    "if the burst with the smallest minimum distance ( grb 970902 ) is real then the pbh burst rate density lower limit is @xmath42 bursts @xmath41 ( this value is excluded by other high - energy experiments , however ) .",
    "all these estimates assume that pbhs are distributed uniformly in the solar neighborhood . the ipn pbh burst rate density lower limit values are shown in figure  [ fig : pbh - limit - final ] .",
    "pbh burst upper limits from various other searches are also shown in the figure .    in the worst case scenario where none of our candidates is a real pbh burst , we can not estimate a lower limit to the pbh burst rate density and instead consider to estimate an upper limit to the pbh burst rate density .",
    "however , the assumption that none of the bursts in the sample is real but still we have candidates implies that our criteria to identify pbh bursts defined in section  [ data_selection ] is not sufficient .",
    "this means our method is not capable of setting an upper limit on the pbh burst rate density .",
    "the detection of gamma - ray transients points to very high energy explosive phenomena in the universe .",
    "their detection in the solar neighborhood would indicate a previously unrecognized and potentially exotic phenomenon in our cosmic backyard .",
    "the sample of bursts identified in this paper are candidates for such explosions .",
    "they have short durations , no known afterglow detections , and have distance limits consistent with the solar neighborhood . in principle",
    "our methodology is capable of proving the local origin of bursts .",
    "however in order to do that we need either four widely separated non - imaging spacecraft or two spacecraft that include one with imaging capability ( see section  [ methodology ] and appendix a ) .",
    "this is not the case for any of the bursts we considered in our study . while some events were indeed detected by four or more spacecraft , the spacecraft were not widely separated , i.e. at interplanetary distances . with four widely separated non - imaging spacecraft detections or detections by one imaging spacecraft and one non - imaging spacecraft ,",
    "it would be possible to prove that some of these bursts are in the solar neighborhood and this would definitely point to an exotic origin for these bursts . lacking that however , we can look at other properties of these bursts and discuss how likely it is that they may have a pbh origin .",
    "firstly , it is of interest to investigate the sky distribution of our pbh burst candidates .",
    "for example ,  @xcite have argued that , due to the fact that very short duration grbs ( i.e. , grbs with duration @xmath43 100 msec ) have a non - isotropic sky distribution , they may be drawn from a different grb population , possibly from pbh bursts . in order to investigate this",
    "we have calculated burst density maps using the gaussian kernel density methodology described in @xcite . since the sky locations of the pbh candidates depends on their distance from earth , we started by assuming all the bursts are at their minimum distances and calculated their sky density map .",
    "this map is shown in figure  [ sky_map_pbh_candidate_min ] .",
    "the map is presented in galactic coordinates with a 25 degree smoothing radius .",
    "it shows some relatively high density areas , but the probability of generating this density contrast by chance , in the case when the true sky distribution is uniform , is @xmath400.2 , estimated using a monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "thus the density structure seen in figure  [ sky_map_pbh_candidate_min ] is consistent with a uniform source distribution .",
    "if these pbh candidates are real , they can not be further away than @xmath4010 parsecs ( which is the maximum possible distance they can be detected assuming the optimistic hagedorn - type model ) .",
    "we then also calculated the sky locations of the pbh candidates assuming they are at 10 parsecs and derived the sky density map as shown in figure  [ sky_map_pbh_candidate_10pc ] .",
    "this map is also consistent with a uniform source distribution .",
    "this is the behaviour one would expect if these pbh burst are local with maximum detectable distance @xmath4010 parsecs .    according to the standard model for hawking radiation @xcite , pbh bursts are standard candles , that is , all pbh bursts are intrinsically identical at the source",
    ". however , the way the burst appears at large distances may vary depending on its host environment .",
    "the final burst properties of the pbh burst depend on its mass and the number of fundamental particle degrees of freedom available at various energies  @xcite . in principle , by measuring the photon flux arriving from a pbh burst candidate in a given energy range , we can calculate the distance to that burst . however , during the last second of the pbh lifetime , its temperature is well above @xmath40 1 tev and the physics governing these high energies is not fully understood .",
    "thus , the full spectrum of a pbh burst is difficult to calculate .",
    "@xcite have calculated pbh burst light curves in the 50 gev  100 tev energy range using the standard model of particle physics .",
    "this calculation considered both the direct hawking radiation of photons from the black hole and the photons created due to the fragmentation and hadronization of the directly hawking - radiated quarks and gluons .",
    "the expected pbh light curve is a power - law with an index of @xmath44 and at various sub - energy bands within the 50 gev  100 tev energy range has an interesting inflection point due to the brief dominance of the directly hawking - radiated photons around @xmath45 second before the pbh expiration .",
    "this is potentially a unique signature of a pbh burst in the gev / tev energy range .",
    "the detectors in the ipn are sensitive to photons in the energy range 10 kev  100 mev .",
    "there are no published calculations of pbh burst light curves in the kev / mev range using the standard model of particle physics to which we can fit our light curves and extract fit parameters .",
    "nonetheless it is of interest to look at the light curves of our pbh burst candidates .",
    "firstly , we note that , although a pbh will be emitting in the kev / mev range before it becomes hot enough to emit in the gev / tev range , a kev / mev burst signal can only be generated by the low energy component of a pbh that is also emitting in the gev / tev range : this is because a 10 tev black hole has a remaining burst lifetime of @xmath401 s whereas a @xmath241 gev black hole has a lifetime @xmath46 yr and observationally would be a stable source not a burst . this low energy photon component , in turn , is predominantly generated by other higher energy hawking - radiated species via decays or the inner bremsstrahlung effect  @xcite and is not the directly hawking - radiated photon flux which decreases in the kev / mev band as the burst progresses . acknowledging the uncertainty in the pbh light curves in the kev / mev range , it is also possible that the pbh burst signal may have a longer or shorter duration in the kev / mev range than in the gev / tev range due to differences both in production at the source and in detector sensitivity , and that the duration difference varies with the distance to the pbh .",
    "figure  [ lc_grid ] shows the light curves of the 36 ipn bursts in our sample .",
    "some are clearly single - peaked , others are clearly multi - peaked , and some were not recorded with sufficient statistics to determine the true number of peaks .",
    "it is interesting to note that bursts such as grb 970921 , grb 080222 , grb000607 , grb 101009 , grb 121127 , grb 131126a , and grb 141011a display a kev / mev time profile that resembles the pbh light curve profile calculated by  @xcite for the gev / tev energy range .    in this paper",
    ", we introduced a novel method to constrain the distances to grbs using detections from multiple spacecraft . utilizing detections from three non - imaging spacecraft",
    "we could only constrain the minimum distances to our current sample of bursts .",
    "the maximum distance is constrained by the energy available during the final second of the pbh burst .",
    "however , the amount of energy released in the kev / mev energy band is not known and may be highly model - dependent .",
    "on the other hand , with detections by four widely separated ( @xmath40 au distances ) non - imaging spacecraft or one non - imaging spacecraft and one imaging spacecraft , we can constrain burst distances independent of any high energy physics model , and potentially show that some bursts are local .",
    "such a detection will not only prove the existence of pbh bursts , by fitting light curves and spectra derived using various beyond the standard model physics theories , we can also identify which theory describes nature .",

    "for every point on this hyperbola , the difference in the arrival times is @xmath64 .",
    "if we assume an infinite distance for the source , the asymptotes of the hyperbola define the two possible arrival directions of the grb .          in practice , we will have two or more hyperboloids generated by three or more spacecraft , and we will want to work in earth - centered cartesian coordinates with one axis oriented towards right ascension zero , declination zero , and another axis oriented towards declination 90@xmath66 .",
    "consider the three - spacecraft case .",
    "a spacecraft pair will define two foci of a hyperboloid ; the line joining the two spacecraft , which defines the axis of rotation of the hyperboloid , will be oriented with respect to earth - centered coordinates such that it represents a rotation and a translation .",
    "we want to express the formula for the hyperboloid in the earth - centered system .        here",
    "the primed coordinate system is the one defined by the foci of the hyperboloid ; its origin is the same as that of the unprimed , earth - centered system , and it is rotated , but not translated , with respect to it .",
    "now perform a translation of the primed system so that its origin is at the midpoint of the two foci . if the coordinates of the two spacecraft , expressed in the unprimed system , are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , the origin of the translated system will be at ( @xmath51 + @xmath54)/2 , ( @xmath52 + @xmath55)/2 , ( @xmath53 + @xmath56)/2 .",
    "the formula for the hyperboloid , expressed in the earth - centered system , becomes      where @xmath69 and @xmath70 refer to the hyperboloid for spacecraft 1 and 2 .",
    "a similar equation describes the hyperboloid for spacecraft 1 and 3 .",
    "although a third equation can be derived for spacecraft 2 and 3 , it is not independent of the other two , because it is constrained by the condition @xmath64 + @xmath71 + @xmath72 = 0 .",
    "the locus of points describing the intersection of two hyperboloids is a simple hyperbola , contained in a plane .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "this hyperbola contains all the points satisfying the time delays for the two spacecraft pairs , @xmath64 and @xmath71 , when the grb distance is allowed to vary .",
    "the two branches of the hyperbola intersect the celestial sphere at two points ; if the distance is taken to be infinite , the two points are the possible source locations .",
    "it follows that a grb observed by three , and only three , widely separated non - imaging spacecraft , can not be unambiguously proven to originate at a local distance ; on the other hand , in the case where the hyperbola degenerates to a single point , that point must be at an infinite distance , and a local origin can be ruled out .",
    "none of the bursts in this sample were in this category .",
    "the lower limit to the source distance is the point on the hyperbola ( @xmath57 ) which is closest to earth .",
    "this can be found by solving for the minimum of the expression @xmath74 ( the earth distance ) subject to the constraints imposed by equations a1 and a2 . in practice",
    "there are uncertainties associated with @xmath64 and @xmath71 , and we have used the most probable values to derive the lower limits . since @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 vary along the hyperbola , the apparent arrival direction for an observer at earth depends on the assumed distance ; if the source distance is assumed to be infinite , the derived right ascension and declination will not be correct if the source is actually local .",
    "for example , if grb 140807 were at its minimum allowable distance ( @xmath78 cm , or @xmath79 au ) , the angle between its true coordinates and the coordinates for an infinitely distant source would be @xmath80 .",
    "but for grb 101129 , whose minimum allowable distance is only @xmath81 cm , or 2.6 au , the angle would be 54.2 .",
    "eliminates one branch of the hyperbola and part of the second branch , leading to a larger distance lower limit .",
    "thus , in the case of four widely separated spacecraft , it is in principle possible to rule out an infinite distance and prove that the origin is local as illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "however , this was not the case for any of the bursts in this study ; they are all consistent with both local and infinite distances .",
    "note that this method does not depend on the properties of the grb itself , such as duration or intensity ; the lower limit is determined by the ipn configuration ( through the spacecraft coordinates ) and the direction of the burst ( through the time delays ) .",
    "thus , for example , it can be applied equally to long- and short - duration bursts , and a sample of long - duration events would yield a distribution of lower limits which was comparable to a sample of short - duration events .",
    "one special case should be noted here . with just two widely separated spacecraft ,",
    "if one has precise imaging capability , the problem reduces to finding the intersection of a hyperboloid and the vector defined by the precise localization from the imager . in principle",
    ", a local origin can be demonstrated , or a distance lower limit can be obtained .",
    "we have studied approximately two hundred grbs which are in this category , and analysis of the results is ongoing .",

    "<S> these bursts have minimum possible distances in the 10@xmath010@xmath1 cm ( 710@xmath2 au ) range , consistent with the expected pbh energetics and with a possible origin in the solar neighborhood , although none of the bursts can be unambiguously demonstrated to be local . assuming these bursts are real pbh events , we estimate lower limits on the pbh burst evaporation rate in the solar neighborhood . </S>"
