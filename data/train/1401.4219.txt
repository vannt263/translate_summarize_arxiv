    "<S> we study the phenomenology of the @xmath0 decays ( @xmath1 ) , predicting the respective branching ratios and di - lepton invariant - mass spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the model - independent ( @xmath2 ) contributions , we investigate the structure - dependent ( @xmath3 ) terms , encoding features of the hadronization of @xmath4 currents . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant form factors are evaluated by supplementing chiral perturbation theory with the inclusion of the lightest ( axial-)vector resonance multiplet as dynamical fields . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian couplings are fully predicted requiring the known @xmath4 asymptotic behavior to the relevant green functions and associated form factors in the limit of an infinite number of colours . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the @xmath5 decays should be discovered soon while this is not granted for the @xmath6 case .    </S>",
    "<S> the considered decays @xcite have not been detected yet , although they are the crossed channels of the @xmath7 decays , measured long ago  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these decays probe the @xmath8 vertex , with both virtual gauge bosons and complement the @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays , which are sensitive to the @xmath11 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> qcd predictions can be tested through its knowledge in the whole kinematical regime , which allows computing radiative corrections to the non - photon processes and the evaluation of the hadronic light - by - light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generally , hadronic tau decays are very relevant to extrapolate between the known chiral limit and asymptotic regime enabling precision studies  @xcite@xmath12 @xcite .    the examined processes span different energy regions according to the energies of the exchanged @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> at low momenta , chiral perturbation theory @xcite is the effective field theory dual to qcd and determines the low - energy ( chiral ) limit of the form factors . at larger energies </S>",
    "<S> the chiral expansion breaks down but @xmath15 provides an adequate alternative expansion parameter to enlarge the domain of applicability up to the kinematical limit </S>",
    "<S> . a convenient realization of these ideas for light - flavored mesons is resonance chiral theory  @xcite , which we have followed . </S>",
    "<S> its basic principles are the known chiral symmetry breaking , the discrete qcd symmetries , and unitary symmetry for the resonances without any ad - hoc dynamical assumption on the special role of vector mesons . </S>",
    "<S> although an infinite number of states is predicted in the @xmath16 limit , the @xmath0 decays damp completely the contribution of excited resonances canceling any dependence on the modelization of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we have also included the most important leading corrections to this setting , given by tree - level local effective interactions among mesons and energy - dependent resonance off - shell widths  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these processes are obtained by requiring that the photon in the one - pion radiative tau decays becomes virtual and converts into a lepton pair . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> analogous contributions are obtained : inner bremsstrahlung off the tau , off the pion or from the local @xmath17 vertex and model dependent parts encoding the hadronization of the ( axial-)vector current . </S>",
    "<S> the different interference terms are non - vanishing and sizable , in general . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic form factors depend on the photon virtuality and on the product of photon and pion momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that in the hadronization of the axial - vector current a diagram which vanished for on - shell photon @xcite contributes in the present case , being proportional to the isovector part of the @xmath18 vector form factor , for which a dispersive representation @xcite fulfilling analyticity and unitarity in the elastic region and describing data successfully was used .    </S>",
    "<S> hadronic form factors must satisfy qcd short - distance behavior . by requiring it , consistent relations among the lagrangian couplings </S>",
    "<S> are obtained @xcite in agreement with previous results @xcite@xmath12 @xcite@xmath12 @xcite@xmath12 @xcite allowing to predict the phenomenology of the considered decays . </S>",
    "<S> a conservative variation of @xmath19 was allowed on these relations in order to estimate the error of the high - energy constraints @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the central values of the different contributions to the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decays ( @xmath1 ) are displayed on the left - hand side of the table below . </S>",
    "<S> the error bands of these are given in the right - hand side of the table . </S>",
    "<S> the error bar of the ib contribution stems from the uncertainties on the @xmath20 decay constant and @xmath21 lepton lifetime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to these results the @xmath22 decays should be discovered soon at belle - ii or at a future @xmath23 factory . on the contrary , this is not granted for the @xmath6 decays which should deserve a dedicated search at future facilities .    [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    structure - dependent effects essentially saturate the @xmath6 decays and are @xmath24 in the electron case . </S>",
    "<S> this implies much larger errors in the muon case , as displayed in the table . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized di - lepton invariant mass distribution in both cases is analyzed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inner - bremsstrahlung contribution dominates in either case up to @xmath25 gev@xmath26 where the axial - vector contribution overtakes it . </S>",
    "<S> this changes the slope of the curve in a measurable way even with very limited statistics . with a fine binning and more events , the @xmath27 contribution ( through the @xmath28 pion vector form factor ) </S>",
    "<S> will show up as a prominent peak .    </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements are ready for installation in the new tauola hadronic currents @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present study is also relevant for better characterizing the associated background for lepton flavour violating searches @xcite in the @xmath29 process . </S>"
