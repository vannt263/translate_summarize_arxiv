    "the evaluation of performance measures in stochastic models is a key problem that has been widely studied in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the evaluation of the delay distribution of a single server queue where customers arrive according to a markovian arrival process ( marp ) @xcite and their service times follow some general distribution . under the presence of heavy",
    "/ tailed service times , such evaluations become more challenging and sometimes even problematic @xcite .",
    "in such cases , it is necessary to construct approximations . in this study",
    ", we propose to modify existing approximations by adding a small refinement term , which can serve two purposes . on the one hand",
    ", the refinement term helps in constructing approximations not only with a small absolute error , but also with a small relative error . on the other hand ,",
    "it gives information on the accuracy of the approximation without the modification : the smaller the refinement term , the better the pre / modified approximation",
    ".    an important generalization of the poisson point process is the marp . in a marp ,",
    "the arrivals are determined by a markov process @xmath0 with a finite state space .",
    "the class of marps is a very rich class of point processes , containing many well / known arrival processes as special cases .",
    "a special case of a marp is the markov / modulated poisson process ( mmpp ) , which is a popular model for bursty arrivals @xcite .",
    "the class of marps contains also the class of phase / type renewal processes , i.e.  renewal processes with phase / type interarrivals @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the laplace transform of the delay of a marp / g/1 queue has a matrix expression analogous to the pollazceck / khinchine equation of an m / g/1 queue @xcite . however , these closed / form expressions are only practical in case of phase / type service times @xcite , where the delay distribution has a phase / type representation @xcite in a form which is explicit up to the solution of a matrix fixed point problem",
    ".    since the class of phase / type distributions is dense in the class of all distributions on @xmath1 @xcite , a common approach to approximate the delay is by approximating the service time distribution with a phase / type one ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these methods as _ phase / type approximations_. there are many algorithms for phase / type approximations , which provide highly accurate approximations for the delay distribution when the service times are light / tailed .",
    "however , in many cases , a heavy / tailed distribution is most appropriate to model the service times @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the exponential decay of phase / type approximations gives a big relative error at the tail and the evaluation of the delay becomes more complicated .",
    "since heavy / tailed distributions have cumbersome expressions for their laplace transform , this prevents the usage of techniques that require transform expressions , such as @xcite .    in this paper , we develop approximations of the delay distribution for heavy / tailed service times that maintain the computational tractability of phase / type approximations , capture the correct tail behavior and provide small absolute and relative errors . in order to achieve these desirable characteristics ,",
    "our key idea is to use a mixture model for the service times .",
    "the idea of our approach stems from fitting procedures of the service time distribution to data .",
    "heavy / tailed statistical analysis suggests that only a small fraction of the upper / order statistics of a sample is relevant for estimating tail probabilities @xcite .",
    "the remaining data set may be used to fit the bulk of the distribution , where , as we mentioned earlier , a natural choice is to fit a phase / type distribution to the remaining data set @xcite . as a result , a mixture model for the service times",
    "is a natural assumption .",
    "we now briefly explain how to derive our approximations when the service time distribution is a mixture of a phase / type distribution and a heavy / tailed one .",
    "we show that if the service time distribution is such a mixture , then the queueing delay can also be written as a mixture , in the sense that it involves the queueing delay of a model with purely phase / type service times and some additional terms related to the heavy / tailed distribution of our mixture model .",
    "consequently , we first need to compute the delay in a marp / ph/1 queue and afterwards use this as a base to calculate the rest of the terms involving the heavy / tailed distribution .    as a first step to derive our approximations ,",
    "we write the service time distribution as perturbation of the phase / type distribution by a function that contains the heavy / tailed component . by ignoring the perturbation term and by taking the service time distribution equal to the phase / type distribution",
    ", we find the delay of a resulting simpler marp / ph/1 queue , which is a phase / type approximation of the queueing delay . by applying perturbation analysis to all parameters that depend on the service time distribution , we can write the queueing delay as a series expansion , where the constant term is the delay of the marp / ph/1 queue used as base and all other terms contain the heavy / tailed component .",
    "large deviations theory suggests that a single catastrophic event , i.e.  a stationary heavy / tailed service time , is sufficient to give a non / zero tail probability for the queueing delay @xcite . as we will see in section  [ s3.workload distribution of the perturbed model ] , the second term of the series expansion of the queueing delay can be expressed in terms of such a catastrophic event .",
    "thus , we define our approximations as the sum of the first two terms of the series expansion of the queueing delay , and we show that the addition of the second term leads to improved approximations when compared to their phase / type counterparts . in other words ,",
    "the second term makes the phase / type approximation more robust so that the relative error at the tail does not explode .",
    "therefore , we call this term correction term , and inspired by the terminology _ corrected heavy traffic approximations _ @xcite we refer to our approximations as _ corrected phase / type approximations_. in a previous study @xcite , we applied this approach to poisson arrivals .",
    "the connection between the stationary delay distribution of a marp / g/1 queue and ruin probabilities for a risk process in a markovian environment , where the claim sizes in the risk model correspond to the service times and the arrival process of claims is the time / reversed marp of the queueing model , is well known @xcite .",
    "thus , the corrected phase / type approximations can also be used to estimate the ruin probabilities of the above mentioned risk model .",
    "finally , our technique can be applied to more general queueing models , i.e.  queuing models with dependencies between interarrival and service times @xcite , and also to models that allow for customers to arrive in batches ( the arrival process is called then batch markovial arrival process ) @xcite .",
    "a closely related work is adan and kulkarni @xcite .",
    "they consider a single server queue , where the interarrival times and the service times depend on a common discrete markov chain .",
    "in addition , they assume that a customer arrives in each phase transition , and they find a closed form expression for the delay distribution under general service time distributions . however , when there exist also phase transitions not related to arrivals of customers , their results remain valid for the evaluation of the workload .",
    "this can be seen by using the standard technique of including _ dummy _ customers in the model ; namely customers with zero service times .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s3.presentation of the model ]",
    ", we introduce the model under consideration without assuming any special form for the service time distribution , and in section  [ s3.preliminaries ] we find the general expressions for the laplace transforms of the queueing delay a customer experiences upon arrival in each state . in section  [ s3.construction of the corrected phase - type approximations ] ,",
    "we consider service time distributions that are a mixture of a phase / type distribution and a heavy / tailed one , and we explain the idea to construct our approximations . later in section  [ s3.replace base model ] , we specialize the results of section  [ s3.preliminaries ] for phase / type service times .",
    "we use as base model the phase / type model of section  [ s3.replace base model ] , and we apply perturbation analysis to find in section  [ s3.parameters of the perturbed system ] the perturbed parameters and in section  [ s3.workload distribution of the perturbed model ] the desired laplace transforms of the delay in the mixture model . using the latter results , we construct in section  [ s3.properties corrected replace approximations ] the approximations and we discuss their properties . in section",
    "[ s3.corrected discard approximation ] , we discuss an alternative way to construct approximations for the queueing delay . furthermore , in section",
    "[ s3.numerics ] , we use a specific mixture service time distribution for which the exact delay distribution can be calculated and we exhibit the accuracy of our approximations through numerical experiments . finally , in the appendix , we give the proofs of all theorems , the necessary theory on perturbation analysis , and other related results . due to the complexity of the formulas",
    ", we use a simple running example in order to explain the idea behind the calculations .",
    "we consider a single server queue with fifo discipline , where customers arrive according to a markovian arrival process ( marp ) .",
    "the arrivals are regulated by a markov process @xmath0 with a finite state space @xmath2 , say with @xmath3 states .",
    "we assume that the service time distribution of a customer is independent of the state of @xmath4 upon his arrival . for this model , we are interested in finding accurate approximations for the delay distribution .",
    "the intensity matrix @xmath5 governing @xmath4 is denoted by the decomposition @xmath6 , where the matrix @xmath7 is related to arrivals of _ dummy _ customers , while transitions in @xmath8 are related to arrivals of _ real _ customers .",
    "note that the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath8 may not be identically equal to zero .",
    "this means that if @xmath9 , then a real customer arrives with rate @xmath10 and we have a transition from state @xmath11 to itself .",
    "however , phase transitions not associated with arrivals ( dummy customers ) from any state to itself are not allowed . since the matrix @xmath5 is an intensity matrix , its rows sum up to zero .",
    "therefore , the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath7 are negative and they are defined as @xmath12 .    in this paper , we are interested in modeling heavy / tailed service times .",
    "as stated earlier , motivated by statistical analysis , we assume that the service time distribution of a real customer is a mixture of a phase / type distribution , @xmath13 , and a heavy / tailed one , @xmath14 .",
    "namely , the service time distribution of a real customer has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is typically small .",
    "our goal is to find the delay distribution for this mixture model . towards this direction ,",
    "we present in the next section existing results @xcite for the evaluation of the delay distribution under the assumption of generally distributed service times .",
    "ultimately , we wish to specialize these results to service times of the aforementioned form .",
    "since the results of this section are valid for any service time distribution , we suppress the index @xmath16 and we use the notation @xmath17for the service time distribution of a real customer .",
    "we consider now the embedded markov chain @xmath18 on the arrival epochs of customers ( real and dummy ) and we denote by @xmath19the transition probability matrix of the regulating markov chain @xmath20 , which we assume to be irreducible . if @xmath21 is the exponential exit rate from state @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath22 the transition probabilities can be calculated by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kronecker delta ( @xmath25 when @xmath26 and @xmath27 when @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , an arriving customer at a transition from state @xmath11 to state @xmath29 is tagged @xmath11 . if @xmath30 , then we define the probability @xmath31 which is the probability of an arriving customer to be dummy conditioned on the event that there is a phase transition from state @xmath11 to @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , conditioned on the event that there is a phase transition from @xmath11 to @xmath29 , the arriving customer is real with probability @xmath32 if @xmath33 , then we define @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , the conditional service time distribution of an arriving customer at a transition from @xmath11 to @xmath29 is @xmath35 , and its laplace / stieltjes transform ( lst ) is @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the lst of the service time distribution @xmath17of a real customer . in matrix form",

    "we also define the matrix @xmath47 which we will need later .",
    "finally , let @xmath48 $ ] be the stationary distribution of @xmath18 , and @xmath49be the mean of the service time distribution @xmath17 .",
    "then the system is stable if the mean service time of a customer is less than the mean inter / arrival times between two consecutive customers in steady state .",
    "namely , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52is the column vector with appropriate dimensions and all elements equal to 1 .",
    "note that the @xmath44 element of the matrix @xmath53 is the unconditional probability that a real customer arrives at a transition from @xmath11 to @xmath29 .    from this point on ,",
    "we use a simple running example so that we display the involved parameters and the derived formulas .",
    "the running example evolves progressively , which means that its parameters are introduced only once and the reader should consult a previous block of the example to recall the notation .    for our running example",
    ", we consider a marp with erlang-2 distributed interarrival times , where the exponential phases have both rate @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore , the matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given as follows : @xmath56 in this case , we have that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and all other elements of the matrices @xmath60and @xmath61are equal to zero .",
    "observe that we only have transitions from state  1 to state  2 and from state  2 to state  1 .",
    "therefore , in state  1 we always have arrivals of dummy customers while in state  2 we only have arrivals of real customers .",
    "thus , only the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath62are not equal to zero , so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "finally , the stability condition takes its known form @xmath65 .",
    "let now @xmath66denote the steady / state workload of the system just prior to an arrival of a customer .",
    "if the arriving customer is real , then the workload just prior to its arrival equals the delay or waiting time of the customer in the queue , which we denote by @xmath67 . in terms of laplace transforms , the steady / state workload of the system",
    "just prior to an arrival of a customer in state @xmath11 is found as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the steady / state limit of @xmath70 .",
    "gathering all the above laplace transforms @xmath71 , @xmath72 , we construct the transform vector @xmath73.\\ ] ]    we first provide some general theorems for the transform vector @xmath74and we give its connection to the laplace transform @xmath75of the queueing delay of real customers .",
    "later on we refine these results in order to provide more detailed information regarding the form of the elements @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in the following , @xmath76stands for the identity matrix , with appropriate dimensions .",

    "note that the above theorem is similar to theorem  3.1 in @xcite and so does its proof .",
    "therefore , we omit here the proof and we refer the reader to theorem  3.1 of @xcite for more details .",
    "a real customer arrives in state @xmath11 with probability @xmath79 , and consequently a real customer arrives in the system with probability @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the following relation holds @xmath81 thus , if @xmath82is a column vector of dimension @xmath3 such that @xmath83 the laplace transform of the queuing delay is found as @xmath84    if @xmath85 denotes the determinant of the square matrix @xmath86 , then for the determination of the unknown vector @xmath87 , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ t3.solution for vector u ] the next two statements hold :    1 .",

    "post / multiplying eq .",
    "with @xmath99 , we have that @xmath102 , and consequently @xmath103 the first statement of theorem  [ t3.solution for vector u ] says that the determinant @xmath104 has the factors @xmath105 , @xmath72 , in its expression .",
    "this means that the transform vector @xmath74has @xmath3 potential singularities on the positive half plane , as the determinant appears at the denominator .",
    "however , the second statement of theorem  [ t3.solution for vector u ] explains that the vector @xmath87is such that these problematic factors are canceled out .",

    "[ d3.corrected simplified discard approximation ] the simplified corrected discard approximation of the survival function @xmath358 of the exact queueing delay is defined as    @xmath401    where @xmath398 is the replace phase / type approximation of @xmath358 and @xmath402 is defined in approximation  [ d3.corrected discard approximation ] .    in the next section , we perform numerical experiments to check the accuracy of the corrected phase / type and the simplified corrected phase / type approximations .",
    "in addition , we show that indeed the corrected approximations do not differ significantly from their simplified versions .",
    "in section  [ s3.workload distribution of the perturbed model ] , we pointed out that the first term of the corrected replace expansion is already a phase / type approximation of the queueing delay , a result that holds also for the discard expansion . in this section , we show that the addition of the correction term leads to improved approximations that are significantly more accurate than their phase / type counterparts .",
    "therefore , we check here the accuracy of the corrected phase / type approximations ( see definitions  [ d3.corrected replace approximation ]  [ d3.corrected simplified discard approximation ] ) by comparing them with the exact delay distribution and their corresponding phase / type approximations .    for the marp arrival process of customers",
    "we choose a mmpp with two states and a mmpp with five states . since it is more meaningful to compare approximations with exact results than with simulation outcomes , we choose the service time distribution such that we can find an exact formula for the queueing delay .    as service time distribution",
    "we use a mixture of an exponential distribution with rate @xmath403 and a heavy / tailed one that belongs to a class of long - tailed distributions introduced in @xcite .",
    "the laplace transform of the latter distribution is @xmath404 , where @xmath405 and all higher moments are infinite .",
    "furthermore , the laplace transform of the stationary heavy / tailed claim size distribution is @xmath406 which for @xmath407 can take the form @xmath408 for this combination of service time distributions , the survival queueing delay can be found explicitly , by following the same ideas as in theorem  9 of @xcite .",
    "what is left now is to fix values for the parameters of the mixture models and perform our numerical experiments .",
    "thus , for the mmpp(2 ) arrival process we choose the parameters such that @xmath409 , @xmath410 , @xmath411 , and @xmath412 ( the rest of the parameters can be calculated using the formulas  ) . for the mmpp(5 ) model we choose : @xmath413 and @xmath414 .",
    "although we do not have any restrictions for the parameters of the involved service time distributions , from a modeling point of view , it is counterintuitive to fit a heavy / tailed service / time distribution with a mean smaller than the mean of the phase / type service / type distribution . for this reason ,",

    "for this choice of parameters , the load of the first system is equal to 0.909336 and of the second is 0.812845 .            as we observe from figures  [ f3.approximations queueing delays 1][f3.approximations queueing delays 2 ] , the phase / type approximations ( replace and discard ) give accurate estimates for small values of the queueing delay , while they are incapable of capturing the correct tail behavior of the exact survival function of the queueing delay .",
    "contrary , both corrected phase / type approximations are highly accurate and give a small relative error at the tail .",
    "more precisely , we can observe the following :    * the corrected replace approximation gives better numerical estimates than the corrected discard approximation .",
    "especially , in figure  [ f3.approximations queueing delays 2 ] the corrected / replace approximation if hardly distinguishable from the exact distribution . *",
    "the corrected discard approximation always underestimates the exact tail probability of the queueing delay .",
    "contrary , the corrected replace approximation may overestimate the exact survival function for small values , but always underestimates the tail of the exact queueing delay . * the corrected phase / type approximations do not differ significantly from their simplified versions .",
    "the maximum observed absolute error between the two corrected replace approximations is smaller than 0.0011 for the mmpp(2 ) model and smaller than 0.00069 for the mmpp(5 ) model .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the corrected discard approximations are 0.0052 and 0.00167 . * finally , we estimated the relative error at the tail for all four corrected phase / type approximations .",
    "we found that in the mmpp(2 ) model the relative error is smaller than @xmath419 for all the approximations , while this number reduces to @xmath420 in the mmpp(5 ) model .",
    "to conclude , all corrected replace approximations are highly accurate and there is no significant difference between them . for this reason , the simplified versions of the approximations serve as excellent substitutes to their original corrected phase / type approximations for estimating the queueing delay . finally , the corrected phase / type approximations give a small relative error at the tail , which can easy be verified to be @xmath421 .",
