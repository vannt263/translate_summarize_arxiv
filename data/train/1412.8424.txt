    "we consider a situation where a thin slab of homeotropic smectic - a is subject to dilative stress @xcite . in this case , the smectic layers are parallel to the glass slides , so that the stretching of the gap promotes an increase of the interlayer spacing .",
    "planar - layer configurations store a considerable amount of bulk energy as strain is increased , which is released with the formation of an undulation pattern after a critical strain is reached . here",

    "our elastic free energy density is given by : @xmath151 notice that we have not included a saddle - splay term , nor have we considered amplitude dependence of the elastic constant @xmath16 , since their effects are negligible .",
    "roughly speaking , the amplitude dependence of @xmath17 gives rise to higher - order terms for the undulating solution .",
    "hence we can approximate @xmath13 multiplying @xmath16 and @xmath17 by one , and the saddle - splay term becomes a surface term that vanishes for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "also , we do not need include a lagrange multiplier , since @xmath152 is curl - less if @xmath3 is given by eq . .",
