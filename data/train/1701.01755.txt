    "photonic quantum information processing ( qip ) applications , such as quantum computation @xcite , boson sampling @xcite , and quantum repeaters for long - distance quantum communication networks @xcite , utilize measurement - based protocols that rely on high - visibility interference between individual photons . to successfully carry out these qip tasks",
    "often involves multiple near - perfect interference measurements in parallel and/or in series , which require the interfering photons be indistinguishable in all their characteristic degrees of freedom .",
    "some of these features are easy to control and maintain , such as their polarizations with wave plates and polarizers , and their spatial modes with single - mode fibers or waveguides .",
    "other aspects , such as their spectra and times of arrival at the interference locations , are not as simple to manipulate .",
    "consider the widely used method of generating heralded single photons by pulsed spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) in a nonlinear optical crystal .",
    "typical spdc outputs consist of pairs of spectrally entangled signal and idler photons whose biphoton state has a schmidt number greater than 1 under schmidt decomposition @xcite .",
    "the detection of the idler photon of the spectrally entangled biphoton heralds the presence of the signal photon ; however , the heralded signal photon is in a spectrally mixed state @xcite , as dictated by the biphoton s schmidt mode structure .",
    "therefore , interference of two such heralded photons , even with the same spectral mixture , does not produce high visibility because of their low spectral purity .",
    "recent research in overcoming the low spectral purity of spdc outputs has been focused on methods of generating spectrally pure biphoton state with an ideal schmidt number of 1 @xcite .",
    "a spectrally pure biphoton state is a factorable state , and upon heralding , the signal photon has a well defined and definite spectrum . by adopting the same high - purity biphoton generation method for all interacting photons ,",
    "high - visibility interference measurements in photonic qip tasks are achievable .    in this work ,",
    "periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath0 ( ppktp ) is the nonlinear crystal of choice for its type - ii phase matching with outputs at telecom wavelengths .",
    "more importantly , ppktp can be operated under extended phase matching @xcite that allows the joint spectral amplitude ( jsa ) of the biphoton state to be controlled by two independent parameters : the pump spectrum and the ppktp phase - matching function . to fully optimize the biphoton state s heralded - state spectral purity , the ppktp crystal is custom fabricated to yield a gaussian - shaped phase - matching function @xcite . in section 2",
    "we show three - wave mixing measurement results that verify the shape of the custom phase - matching function .",
    "the heralded - state spectral purity of the biphoton state is typically inferred from its joint spectral intensity ( jsi ) using dispersion - based spectrometry .",
    "two different dispersive elements are used : either a single long optical fiber or , for higher resolution , a low - loss dispersion compensation module ( dcm ) , which yielded the excellent results shown in section 3 . at a pump bandwidth of 0.95",
    "nm we obtain a heralded - state spectral purity of 99% , which is the highest purity to date without the use of filtering .",
    "we also verify that the spdc output is spectrally entangled under extended phase - matching conditions at 5.6 nm pump bandwidth in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results and discuss potential use of our source and characterization methods in photonic qip applications .",
    "a spectrally factorable biphoton state can be formed typically with one of two jsa profiles .",
    "an asymmetric jsa @xcite has an elongated profile ( like a long rectangle ) with the long side oriented along the idler ( @xmath1 ) frequency axis . detecting the idler photon yields a signal ( @xmath2 ) photon in a narrow single frequency mode , regardless of the idler frequency measurement .",
    "the asymmetric jsa has been demonstrated @xcite showing good results that agree with theoretical predictions .",
    "the second jsa profile for a factorable biphoton has a circularly symmetric shape and is based on extended phase matching in which the jsa is the product of the pump spectrum ( @xmath3 ) and the crystal phase - matching function that can be approximated by a ( @xmath4 ) dependence for a reasonably long crystal with type - ii phase matching @xcite .",
    "the pump and phase - matching parameters are oriented @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a plot with @xmath2 and @xmath1 axes , so that the controls using @xmath7 parameters allow for orthogonal and convenient adjustments of the jsa .",
    "our approach follows the extended phase matching technique that has been applied successfully in a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "we note that extended phase matching is called the zero group - velocity mismatch regime in ultrafast optics .    in an earlier experimental attempt to generate high - purity biphotons by spdc under extended phase - matching conditions , a purity of 88%",
    "was obtained without any spectral filtering @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the standard sinc - function shape of the phase - matching function was the limiting factor , and that a gaussian phase - matching function should in principle allow the ( spectrally unfiltered ) purity to reach 100% .",
    "the limitation of the sinc - function shape stems from the presence of its side lobes that break the circular symmetry of the jsa profile .",
    "later experiments that also utilized extended phase matching show similar purity measurement results @xcite with as high as 98% reported when the pulsed spdc output was spectrally filtered at half of its unfiltered output bandwidth @xcite . generally , spectral filtering is undesirable partly because of insertion loss due to the filters .",
    "in addition , when we consider interference between independent heralded single photons from different sources , it can be difficult to match the spectral shapes of the different filters used to eliminate all the side lobes while passing a gaussian - shaped main lobe of the sinc - shaped phase - matching function .",
    "more problematic is the uncertainty of the relative temporal positions of the heralded photons . because the generated state has a schmidt number greater than 1 , the heralded single photons are in a mixed state of two or more eigenstates that may have different temporal locations .",
    "spectral filtering does not affect their relative temporal locations such that interference measurements are degraded due to the mixed temporal states .",
    "a better way than spectral filtering the outputs is to modify the ferroelectric domain structure of the periodically - poled nonlinear crystal to yield a phase - matching function that has a gaussian shape instead of the usual sinc - function shape . in standard crystals ,",
    "the domains are aligned in the same direction , whereas in periodically - poled crystals the domains are alternately aligned and oppositely - aligned with a 50:50 duty cycle , each occupying half of a poling period @xmath8 .",
    "two methods have been proposed and demonstrated for realizing a gaussian phase - matching function .",
    "one is to change the poling period along the length of the crystal , with periods equal to integer multiples of @xmath8 and with the duty cycle remaining at 50:50 @xcite .",
    "the higher order periods yield lower effective nonlinearity that can be used to tailor the phase - matching function to have a gaussian shape .",
    "the second method keeps the poling period at @xmath8 but varies the duty cycle along the length of the crystal which also lowers the effective nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "both methods are expected to achieve similar results in purity measurements of @xmath997% without any filtering and greater than 99% with a mild spectral filter to further suppress the residual side lobes . here",
    "we follow the second method using a similar design but with a slightly longer crystal that optimizes the achievable purity to @xmath999% with no filtering  @xcite .",
    "our ppktp crystal was 18 mm long with a poling period @xmath10 m chosen to yield type - ii phase - matched degenerate outputs at 1582 nm for pumping at 791 nm . in the custom - fabricated ppktp we design the crystal with the duty cycle of the poling periods ranging from a ratio of 10:90 to 90:10  @xcite .",
    "the crystal was anti - reflection coated at both 791 and 1582 nm wavelengths . before characterizing the biphoton s joint spectral intensity profile ,",
    "we first evaluated the phase - matching shape of the custom ppktp crystal by difference - frequency generation ( dfg ) measurements .",
    "a continuous - wave pump at 791 nm with @xmath9100mw of power was combined with a tunable @xmath93-mw probe laser centered at 1582 nm to serve as inputs to the ppktp crystal .",
    "the crystal s temperature was maintained at 26.4@xmath11c so that the peak dfg output occurred at the probe wavelength of 1582 nm , or twice the pump wavelength .",
    "the probe laser wavelength was scanned and the dfg signal was recorded , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dfg ] in ( a ) linear scale and ( b ) log scale .",
    "the measurements show a significant reduction in the usual sinc - function side lobes and a phase - matching function that is gaussian to a large extent .",
    "figure  [ dfg](b ) shows a weak sideband signal at 1578 nm that we believe is mostly caused by noise in our measurement system . as we will see in section 3",
    ", the side lobe suppression can be inferred to be much better than that shown in fig .",
    "to quantify the spectral purity of the spdc output , one can measure the signal - idler joint spectral intensity distribution and apply schmidt decomposition @xcite to calculate the purity of the biphoton state , assuming that the state is transform limited .",
    "the most common method of making jsi measurements is to send the pulsed spdc outputs through two equal - length optical fibers , one for signal and the other for idler , to disperse them after which they are measured by time - correlated coincidence detection .",
    "fiber dispersion serves to perform frequency - to - time conversion and allows one to easily measure the frequency correlation of photon pairs based on their arrival times @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the fiber spectrometer depends on the length of the fibers and the timing resolution of the single - photon detectors . a typical setting with 20 km of standard single - mode fibers ( dispersion coefficient of @xmath917ps / nm / km ) and superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds ) with a timing resolution of 100ps yields a spectral resolution of 0.3 nm . to obtain a higher spectral resolution requires longer fibers with the drawback that the coincidence detection rate is reduced by the combined insertion loss of the two fibers . to reach 0.12 nm resolution requires 50 km of fiber that reduces the coincidence detection rate by a factor of 100 . in practice",
    "the two individual fibers should be of the same length and temperature stabilized to avoid timing errors caused by their relative length change .",
    "our approach to jsi characterization aims to simplify the measurement setup and to obtain enhanced performance .",
    "two configurations are utilized : one uses a single optical fiber with counter - propagating beams to ensure signal and idler see the same fiber length and dispersion , and the second one employs a commercially available low - loss dispersion compensation module to achieve higher resolution without sacrificing coincidence detection rates .",
    "figure  [ setup ] shows the experimental setups for ( a ) spdc biphoton generation , ( b ) single - fiber spectrometer , and ( c ) dcm spectrometer .     optical configuration .",

    "the optical bandwidth of the pump is one of the parameters for controlling the spdc biphoton output . to modify the pump bandwidth we implemented a linear spectral filtering system using a pair of identical diffraction gratings in a 4@xmath15 dispersion - free optical configuration @xcite .",
    "two identical lenses l1 with focal length @xmath12 cm were placed 2@xmath15 apart , and the two diffraction gratings were located a distance @xmath15 from the lenses , as shown in fig .  [ setup](a ) .",
    "the first grating dispersed the collimated pump beam spectrally and the first lens focused the spectrally dispersed components at the focal plane located at a distance _ f _ from l1 .",
    "we placed an adjustable rectangular aperture at the focal plane to control the transmission of the parallel spectral components and therefore the bandwidth of the transmitted pump . the second lens and second grating recombined the transmitted spectral components into one collimated beam with the desired bandwidth . with the aperture wide open , the output of the 4@xmath15 system has the same spectrum as the input s .",
    "we focused the pump to a beam waist of @xmath9124@xmath16 m at the center of the ppktp crystal that was temperature stabilized at @xmath17c to yield wavelength degenerate signal and idler outputs at 1582 nm .",
    "the orthogonally polarized signal and idler were coupled into a single - mode polarization - maintaining ( pm ) fiber with beam collection optics designed to optimize the symmetric heralding efficiency in single - mode fiber coupling @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) the pump was rejected before fiber coupling by a long - pass filter with a cutoff wavelength of 1300 nm , and the signal and idler polarizations were aligned with the pm fiber s fast and slow axes using the combination of a quarter - wave plate and a half - wave plate . for a pump bandwidth of 5.6 nm and at a pump power of 27mw , we measured singles of @xmath995,800/s and @xmath9108,000/s , and @xmath930,000 coincidences / s , which yields a system efficiency of @xmath929% .",
    "figure  [ setup](b ) shows the single - fiber spectrometer setup for characterizing the joint spectral intensity of the spdc output from our custom - fabricated ppktp .",
    "we first separated the fiber - coupled signal and idler with a fiber polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) and sent them through a 42-km smf28 fiber from its opposite ends .",
    "two fiber circulators were used to provide input / output isolation for both signal and idler light before detection by two wsi snspds with detection efficiencies of @xmath980% , timing jitter of @xmath9200ps , and dark count rates of @xmath9400/s .",
    "the dark count rates were low enough that no background subtraction adjustment was needed for all measurements .",
    "the use of a single fiber ensures that the counter - propagating signal and idler see the same amount of dispersion .",
    "the fiber was thermally shielded to reduce variations in length and dispersion due to ambient temperature fluctuations during measurements .",
    "the arrival times of signal and idler photons were recorded relative to the trigger pulses from the mode - locked pump laser . due to fiber dispersion",
    "the propagation times of different spectral components propagate at different speeds resulting in different arrival times , therefore allowing the jsi to be reconstructed based on the measured coincidence timing information .",
    "we calibrated the fiber propagation time in reference to its zero dispersion point at 1310 nm .",
    "the spectral resolution of our 42-km fiber spectrometer is set by the dispersion imposed by the fiber and the temporal measurement resolution given by the snspds timing jitter of 200ps .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath18  km fiber was measured to be 0.78  @xmath19  0.7ns / nm at 1582 nm , in line with manufacturer s published data .",
    "therefore our single - fiber spectrometer had a spectral resolution of @xmath90.25 nm for both signal and idler .",
    "the spectrometer s insertion loss was @xmath910db per channel that was primarily due to the fiber , suggesting a reduction of 100 fold in the coincidence detection rate when compared to measurements without the spectrometer .",
    "figure  [ fiberjsi ] shows the measured log - scale jsi distribution at six different pump bandwidths without the use of any spectral filtering .",
    "the wavelength range was 16 nm centered at 1582 nm that was set by the pump s mode - locking repetition period of 12.5ns and the fiber s dispersion of 0.78ns / nm . the peaks of the jsi distributions for all cases are set to center at 1582 nm that corresponds to the signal and idler degenerate wavelength , thereby setting the correct timing delay we applied relative to the trigger pulses .",
    "we then used the dispersion we had measured ( 0.78ns / nm ) to map the detected arrival times to the corresponding wavelengths .",
    "we only use a linear relation between frequency and time of arrival because any nonlinear adjustment is not significant compared with the relatively large detector timing jitter .",
    "it is known that ppktp under extended phase matching and pulsed pumping generates coincident - frequency entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "that is , signal and idler have the same frequencies and their jsi profile is diagonal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fiberjsi ] .",
    "we see that the wavelength extent of the signal and idler outputs ( along the diagonal ) is reduced as the pump bandwidth varies from 5.6 nm to 0.74 nm , as expected .",
    "the pump spectrum remains approximately gaussian throughout the change and the pump bandwidths reported are gaussian fitted measurements .",
    "overall , the jsi measurements match our theoretical expectations very well .",
    "two particular features of fig .",
    "[ fiberjsi ] are worth mentioning .",
    "the first is that the strongest side lobe of the profiles is at least 24db below the central peak , which corresponds to an 11db suppression of the side lobes of the standard phase - matching sinc function .",
    "this is a more sensitive and therefore more accurate measurement of the residual side lobes than the dfg measurements of fig .",
    "[ dfg](b ) , suggesting that the gaussian profile of our custom fabrication design is quite good .",
    "the second feature is the nearly symmetric profile of the central lobe in fig .",
    "[ fiberjsi](e ) that is consistent with a factorable biphoton output at the pump bandwidth of 0.95 nm .    to quantify the spectral correlation of the generated biphoton states in fig .",
    "[ fiberjsi ] , we assume that the biphoton state is transform limited so that we can perform a singular value decomposition for continuous variables on the square root of our measurement results to obtain the schmidt number @xcite .",
    "the heralded - state purity is given by the inverse of the schmidt number @xcite .",
    "the schmidt number and the corresponding purity at different pump bandwidths are listed in table  1 :    .spectral purity of fig .",

    ", it is expected that the homi should exhibit a gaussian shape instead @xcite .",
    "we made homi measurements with spdc signal and idler as inputs for a pump bandwidth of 5.6 nm .",
    "to minimize multi - pair emission , the applied pump power was set to 0.25nj per pulse and the mean generated photon pair per pulse was @xmath90.3% .",

[",
    "hom1](b ) shows an improved visibility of 96% , suggesting that removing the residual side lobes are useful in improving the signal - idler indistinguishability .",
    "the measured visibility of 96% is actually quite close to the expected value of 97.8% , given that we estimate a visibility degradation of 2.2% owing to imperfect pbs ( 1% leakage of the wrong polarization ) and a fiber beam splitter with a splitting ratio of 49:51 .",

    "the two values are in reasonable agreement and that the difference is possibly due to signal and idler pulse broadening caused by propagation through @xmath96 m of smf-28 fiber prior to the homi measurement . in the ideal case @xcite ,",
    "the biphoton coherence bandwidth is only a function of the signal - idler frequency difference and hence the phase - matching function , and does not depend on the pump bandwidth .",

    "the measured spectral widths are much larger than the phase - matching bandwidth , which proves that the joint state could not be a mixture of low - bandwidth photon pairs and confirms that the spdc output was indeed frequency entangled @xcite .",
