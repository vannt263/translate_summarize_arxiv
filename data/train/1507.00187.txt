    "usually the present universe is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric coupled to the dominant energy components , viz .",
    "baryons , dark matter ( dm ) , and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the two first constitute the main ingredients of cosmic structure .",
    "the latter two comprise the so - called  dark sector \" as their presence is felt only by their gravitational interaction with the former .",
    "while dm ( alongside the baryons ) is nearly pressureless , de is endowed with a high negative pressure responsible for the present accelerated expansion . since",
    ", thus far , the information available on these two components is indirect they have never been directly detected , much less produced in the lab @xmath0 their nature remains unveiled .",
    "this may explain the very often minimalist assumption that they evolve independently of each other , i.e. , that they interact with one another ( and with whatever other component ) gravitationally only .",
    "nevertheless , there is no reason _ a priori _ why they should absolutely not interact otherwise ; further , a coupling in the dark sector is not only natural , it seems inevitable @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ the simplest cosmological model with a high degree of success from the observational side [ the so - called lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) ] takes as de component the cosmological constant , or what is dynamically equivalent , the energy density of the quantum vacuum though finely tuned to a tiny value . alongside this tuning problem",
    "it also presents the so - called  coincidence problem \" , i.e. , the fact that nowadays the energy density of dm is of the same order as that of the cosmological constant despite the former declines with cosmic expansion as @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the scale factor of the frw metric ) while the latter remains fixed @xcite .",
    "+ a way to alleviate , or even solve , the latter problem is to allow for some nongravitational interaction in the dark sector that gives rise to a continuous transfer of energy from de to dm .",
    "( note that a transfer in the opposite direction would only exacerbate the problem , so it is more appealing to assume that the transfer occurs just in that sense ; although the opposite possibility is not excluded , neither is the possibility of one or more changes in the direction of the transfer as the universe expands ) .",
    "current data are compatible with such transfer although the evidence is , so far , not fully conclusive @xcite . for reviews on the subject see @xcite and references therein .",
    "see , also , the recent contributions @xcite . + given our ignorance about the nature of the components of the dark sector ( to begin with , we do not even know whether these are single or multiple components ) , there is no reliable guidance to determine the interaction term . therefore , the expressions proposed in the literature ( except for the obvious restriction that such term must be small , not to deviate seriously from the predictions of the @xmath1cdm model ) are necessarily phenomenological and based on heuristic arguments . here",
    "we propose a different route to arrive at reasonable expressions of such term based on the likely evolution of the ratio between the densities of dm and de .",
    "+ from the history of structure formation we know that the former dominated at early times ( though preceded by a short period of radiation prevalence ) , and from the current accelerated expansion we infer that the latter started to dominate in the recent past , and it will likely dominated for ever at least if the @xmath1cdm or a slight variant of it turns to be the right cosmological model .",
    "therefore , qualitatively speaking , the said ratio must decrease monotonously for most of the time .",
    "although , as argued below , at very high redshifts it must have varied little or even stayed constant , and it will also scarcely vary or be constant in the far future . accordingly , by wisely parametrizing the said ratio and using the conservation equations of the energy components , valid in most theories of gravity , compelling expressions for the interaction term are readily obtained . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii relates the interaction term with the said ratio , establishes the criteria that any reasonable parametrization of the latter should comply with and illustrates it by proposing three different parametrizations based solely on the frw metric and the energy conservation equations .",
    "section iii makes use of recent data on the hubble history to constrain the free parameters entering these parametrizations .",
    "section iv deals with two apparent degeneracies between the interaction term and the equation of state ( eos ) of de .",
    "section v considers different proposals for the interaction term made in the literature to see whether their corresponding ratios between the energy densities comply with the criteria of sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi summarizes our findings . + as usual , a subscript zero attached to any quantity means that the latter is to be evaluated at present time .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous and isotropic universe whose main energy components are baryons , dark matter and dark energy , subscripts @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the first two being pressureless , the latter with a not necessarily constant eos parameter @xmath7 .",
    "+ we first look for an equation describing the dependence of the quantity , @xmath8 , that gauges the strength of the interaction in the dark sector , on the ratio between the densities of dm and de , @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we write the conservation equations of the components as @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the hubble function . in writing last two equations we have implicitly assumed that all dm and all de participate in the interaction . for @xmath12 energy flows from de to dm and vice versa for @xmath8 featuring the opposite sign ; however , as mentioned above , we will take @xmath12 as it alleviates the coincidence problem . in accordance with strong constraints from local gravity experiments",
    "@xcite we assumed that the baryons conserve separately . + as it is readily derived , the condition @xmath13 imposes @xmath14 , i.e. , it restricts the rate at which @xmath15 can decrease as the universe expands .",
    "( recall that in the @xmath1cdm model ( @xmath16 ) one has @xmath17 ) .",
    "+ from the above , we get @xmath18 where the prime stands for @xmath19 . +",
    "we reasonably expect @xmath8 to be smaller than the second term on the left - hand side of ( 2 ) .",
    "this , alongside the restriction @xmath12 , leads to @xmath20 .",
    "+ we now look for reasonable expressions for @xmath21 to be inserted in ( [ eq : q1a ] ) ; this , by passing , will illustrate our method .",
    "any expression for @xmath21 should satisfy @xmath22 , except when @xmath23 and when @xmath24 , because in these limits @xmath25 must either state constant or vary very slowly . hence the quantities @xmath26 , @xmath27 , , dm @xmath28 , and de @xmath29 . ] and @xmath30 must fulfill @xmath31 , with @xmath32 finite . should the latter diverge , it would be because of one of the three following possibilities : ( i ) @xmath33 vanished and @xmath34 stayed finite as @xmath35 .",
    "then , the initial amount of de would be zero and no transfer of de to dm could ever occur whence @xmath8 would vanish altogether at all times .",
    "( ii ) @xmath33 remained bounded but @xmath34 diverged ( in the same limit as above ) . in this second case",
    "( 2 ) implies that @xmath8 would diverge , and by ( 3 ) @xmath36 would become minus infinity .",
    "this , in turn , would lead to the instantaneous transfer of the total amount of de to dm .",
    "that is to say , the dark energy component would disappear completely for good .",
    "however , if @xmath34 would obey @xmath37 where @xmath38 does not vanish as @xmath39 , things would be different , because in this instance , @xmath40 does not diverge .",
    "this introduces an extra uncoupled dm parameter that could be included when comparing with the data .",
    "nevertheless , the expression for @xmath41 corresponds to the case where not all dm interacts , only a part of the total , but this was already excluded from our assumptions above .",
    "( iii ) both energy densities diverge , but @xmath34 tends to a higher infinity than @xmath33 does .",
    "clearly , this case is the same as the previous one .",
    "finally , the expression for @xmath42 must gently interpolate between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "observational data suggest that the former is much larger than unity ; see , e.g. , @xcite",
    ". + the possibility that for some period between @xmath43 and @xmath45 the ratio @xmath15 is not decreasing would imply a severe deviation from the @xmath1cdm model that , most likely , would bring observable consequences on structure formation and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "this is why we assume that @xmath46 , except possibly at @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "a possible choice for the ratio @xmath47 is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are positive - definite constants . as it can be readily checked ( [ eq : r(a)1 ] ) complies with the above conditions , and the corresponding current ratio is @xmath51 . if , as it seems reasonable ( at least for @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 , then @xmath54 .",

    "if the function @xmath233 takes negative values in some interval of the scale factor , there will be no @xmath214 capable of reproducing the @xmath212 function of a given interacting model .",

    "+    on the other hand , even wildly assuming the existence of such eos , both kinds of models will be readily told apart at the perturbative level without the need to perform a detailed analysis . indeed , because in the interacting model dm is continuously added to that component from the de ( recall that @xmath249 ) , as mentioned above , the amount of dark matter in the past was necessarily less than in noninteracting scenarios at the same redshift .",

    "since the present amount of matter ( baryonic , @xmath253 and dark @xmath254 ) has to be the same in both models , the growth function , @xmath255 in the interacting scenario must be larger at any redshift than in the @xmath1cdm model , while the same function in the noninteracting scenario will be , at most , as large as in the latter model . while current measurements of @xmath256 are not accurate enough to do the job , future measurements possibly the next generation of datawill , hopefully , be precise enough to discriminate between the said scenarios .",

    "thus , we infer that the three expressions for @xmath8 in ( [ eq : q6 ] ) fail as physically acceptable interaction terms in the dark sector .",
    "ideally speaking , any valid expression for the interaction between the dm and de components could be obtained by writing the equations of motion after varying the corresponding lagrangian .",
    "however , one can not propose such lagrangian expression without , implicitly or explicitly , presuming a good deal about the microscopic nature of these components .",
    "worse than that , as recently noted , because two fluids should not be considered ideal on their own if they interact with one another , it is unclear if lagrangian ( even if is just effective ) could be ascribed to such a situation @xcite .",
    "this is why we have followed a diverse route when looking for phenomenological , but useful , expressions of the said interaction term . + any interaction in the dark sector is bound to change the ratio between the energy densities of dm and de with respect to the very particular case of no interaction , as it is directly connected to it [ see eq .",

    "( obviously , other expressions for @xmath310 differing from the ones proposed here in sec .",
    "ii are obtainable using other possible parametrizations of @xmath311 . ) likewise , we have restricted ourselves to the case @xmath312 because this helps alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "+ useful constraints on the free parameters have been readily obtained ( sec .",
    "iii ) by imposing the vanishing of the deceleration parameter at the transition redshift @xmath313 , as recently determined @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the latter implies the use of one or another theory of gravity in the present case , general relativity . at any rate ,",
    "the above parametrizations seem to comfortably reproduce the history of the hubble factor ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : farooq1 ] and [ fig : farooq2 ] ) which suggests that these terms should behave reasonably well at the background level because in frw universes , @xmath123 is directly connected to the luminosity and angular distances .",
    "therefore , they are expected to make good fits to current cosmological data from supernovae type ia , baryon acoustic oscillations , the shift of the first acoustic peak of the cosmic microwave background temperature spectrum , and gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters .",
    "nevertheless , we do not claim that these interaction terms should be taken too seriously since they were proposed mainly on illustrative purposes and , ultimately , any cosmological model that assumed whatever interaction term must also fit observations at the perturbation level , such as the matter power spectrum and the evolution of the matter growth factor ; but this lies beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of a future research .",
    "+ we wish to stress that the @xmath314 expressions based on the criteria laid down in sec .",
    "ii do not necessarily are to converge to the @xmath1cdm ratio @xmath315 at any limit .",

    ", they can approximate @xmath317 for @xmath318 with great accuracy . + as sec . iv illustrates , the possible degeneracies between the interaction term and the eos of de are only apparent because they can be readily broken at the background and perturbative levels .",
