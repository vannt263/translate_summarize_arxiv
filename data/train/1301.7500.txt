    "quantum measurement plays a key role in quantum mechanics .",
    "it has some interesting quantum properties which are different from our everyday lives including the collapsing of wavefunction , compatible observables and the contextuality phenomena . for a quantum measurement ,",
    "one need to construct a set of orthogonal projection operators which is corresponding to the observable eigenvector spaces of a hermitian operator .",
    "the possible outcomes of the measurement correspond to the eigenvalues of the hermitian operator .",
    "this is the standard von neumann measurement or projective measurement @xcite .",
    "recently , the formalism was generalized to the povm measurement which stands for ` positive operator valued measure ' , and can really capture many phenomena such as additional randomness measurement outcomes and many others beyond projective measurement .",
    "however , the measurement of quantum state inevitably disturbs the quantum system which in turn determines our retrieved knowledge about the measured system . in order to make the least influence on original quantum state , or",
    "the extent of the influence is variational by active control or depending on environment , one may introduce a measurement that induces a partial collapse of a quantum state .",
    "this is the so - called `` weak measurement '' @xcite .",
    "an interesting thing is that quantum states can be retrieved with a nonzero success probability when the interaction between the system and measurement apparatus is weak @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that any generalized measurements can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements and therefore weak measurement are universal @xcite .",
    "the reversing process has been attracting much attention theoretically and also realized experimentally @xcite due to its potential applications in quantum information processing recently @xcite .",
    "searching for quantum correlation in composite system and identifying their role in quantum information processing is one of the fundamental problems in quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum entanglement is extensively regarded as a crucial role in quantum teleportation and super dense coding , etc .",
    "quantum discord @xcite , which is beyond quantum entanglement , can effectively grasp the role of quantumness of correlations and is different from the classical correlation .",
    "quantum discord is shown to be present in deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) @xcite , as a resource in remote state preparation @xcite , and the consumed discord bounds the quantum advantage in encode information @xcite . quantum dissonance ( or one side discord )",
    "is shown to be required in optimal assisted discrimination @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question we need to solve is that how the correlation exists in composite quantum system . for entanglement",
    ", there are many criteria constructed to detect entangled states @xcite . for the quantum discord",
    ", the vanishing of quantum correlation means the quantum state must be the form of so called classical - classical ( cc ) state , classical - quantum ( cq ) state or quantum - classical ( qc ) state @xcite .",
    "very recently , singh and pati introduced the concept of super quantum discord induced by weak measurement @xcite .",
    "they argued that super quantum discord can capture much more quantum correlation in the sense that the super quantum discord is always larger than the normal discord induced by the strong ( projective ) measurement .",
    "furthermore , super discord can result in an improvement on the entropic uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "now we ask , what is the criterion by which super quantum discord exists in quantum system ? can super discord exist in some quantum information model where quantum discord and entanglement does nt exist ? in this paper , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for super discord in terms of classical correlation , mutual information , and normal discord .",
    "we further illustrate that super discord can present in optimal assisted state discrimination on both sides , where only one side of quantum discord is present and entanglement is totally not needed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ prelimin ] , we recall some definition and property of super discord . in sec .",
    "[ consuper ] , we provide a series of necessary and sufficient condition on vanishing super discord .",
    "an illustration of super discord present on both sides in optimal assisted state discrimination is given in in sec .",
    "[ sudiscrimina ] .",
    "finally we summary in sec .",
    "consider the bipartite state @xmath0 on the space @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be one - dimensional von neumann projectors , and the probability @xmath3 .",
    "the completeness of the operators @xmath2 implies the formula @xmath4 .",
    "next , @xmath5 is the von neumann entropy and  @xmath6 \" denotes  @xmath7 \" throughout the paper .",
    "we refer to @xmath8 as the reduced density operators of @xmath0 .",
    "then we denote @xmath9 as the mutual quantum information and @xmath10 as the classical correlation @xcite . both of them are non - negative because the mutual information is non - negative .",
    "the quantum discord for @xmath0 is defined as the difference between the mutual information and classical correlation @xcite [ ea : discord ] d ( ) & = & i()-c ( ) + & = & s(_b ) - s ( ) + _ _ k _ k p_k s ( ) .",
    "it is known that @xcite the ( `` right '' ) discord is zero if and only if @xmath11 , where the @xmath12 are o. n. basis .",
    "this is the so - called classical state in the system @xmath13 .",
    "next we recall the super quantum discord @xmath14 for two - qubit states @xmath0 introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 9 ) ) .",
    "it is defined as [ ea : superdiscord ] d_w ( ) : = _ \\{_0,_1 } s_w ( a|\\ { p^b(x ) } ) - s(a|b ) , where the conditional entropy @xmath15 and [ ea : sw ] s_w ( a|\\ { p^b(x ) } ) & = & p(x ) s ( _ a | p^b(x ) ) + p(-x ) s ( _ a | p^b(-x ) ) , + [ ea : p(pm x ) ] p(x ) & = & ( ( ip^b(x ) ) ( ip^b(x ) ) ) , + [ ea : apb(pm x ) ] _ a | p^b(x ) & = & 1 p(x ) _ b ( ( ip^b(x ) ) ( ip^b(x ) ) ) , + [ ea : p(x ) ] p(x ) & = & _ 0 + _ 1 , + [ ea : p(-x ) ] p(-x ) & = & _ 0 + _ 1 , and @xmath16 is a parameter describing the strength of measurement process . by eq .",
    ", we have @xmath17 with arbitrary unitary @xmath18 .",
    "one may similarly obtain @xmath19 , so we have [ ea : luinvariant ] d_w(uvu^v^)=d_w ( ) . that is , the super discord is invariant up to the local unitary .",
    "this property is the same as that of normal discord .    by eqs . and",
    ", we obtain the completeness relation [ ea : p0+p1 ] _ 0+_1 & = & p(x)^p(x ) + p(-x)^p(-x ) = i. by eqs . and",
    ", we see that the probability sum is equal to one : [ ea : p(x)+p(-x ) ] p(x)+p(-x)=1 .",
    "using the concavity of von neumann entropy and eqs . and , we easily obtain @xmath20 . by combining the theorem of @xcite , we have [ ea : super>=normal ] i ( ) d_w ( ) d ( ) for any two - qubit states .",
    "however these three quantities are not quantitatively related to the classical correlation .",

    "* eq . 8) .",
    "nevertheless , we will determine the relations between classical correlation , mutual information , super discord and discord for the product states in next section .",
    "similar to the case of discord we ask the following question : what are the states @xmath0 whose super discord is zero ? by eq . and @xcite , such states @xmath0 must be classical in the system @xmath13 .",
    "however the converse is not evidently true , see theorem [ thm : zerosuperdiscord ] . for this purpose",
    "we need a preliminary lemma .",

    "we show that the inverse is also true .",

    "this completes the proof .    as a typical example , theorem",
    "[ thm : zerosuperdiscord ] implies that the maximally mixed state @xmath57 has zero super discord .",
    "this observation has been included as a special case of ( * ? ? ?",
    "note that the equivalence in theorem [ thm : zerosuperdiscord ] does not hold for states with zero discord , because such states may be not product states .",
    "theorem [ thm : zerosuperdiscord ] shows that super discord is ubiquitous in quantum system since that they vanish only on product state .",
    "it is widely accepted that mutual information contains both classical correlation and quantum correlation .",
    "however , they share the same vanishing condition with super discord . by theorem [ thm : zerosuperdiscord ]",
    ", we can also say that super discord is larger than normal discord generally , which makes that super discord really likely reveal much more quantum correlation than quantum discord .",
    "another superiority of super discord is that their vanishing does _ not _ rely on the specific side , although we have the measurement acting on `` left '' or `` right '' system .",
    "the reason is if `` left '' super discord is zero , then the state is a product state by theorem [ thm : zerosuperdiscord ] .",
    "so the `` right '' super discord must be also zero . as an application",
    ", we illustrate how super discord present in optimal assisted discrimination that different from normal discord in next section .",
    "we first review the scheme of state discrimination introduced by roa , retamal and alid - vaccarezza ( rra scheme ) @xcite .",
    "consider two nonorthogonal states @xmath58 and @xmath59 is randomly prepared in one of the _ priori _ probabilities @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 . to discriminate the two states @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "couple the original system to an auxiliary qubit @xmath27 by a joint unitary transformation @xmath63 such that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an auxiliary state with orthonormal basis @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the orthonormal states of the system that can be discriminated .",
    "the state of the system and ancilla qubits is now given as @xmath68 it is shown that the conclusive recognition between two nonorthogonal states relies on the existence of entanglement and discord in general case of rra scheme @xcite .",
    "however , in the optimal case or with maximum recognized probability , only one side ( `` right '' side ) discord ( or dissonance ) is presented @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is that what kinds of non - classical correlation can be regarded as a candidate for resource for the scheme in the optimal case ? by the fact that the super quantum discord is always greater than or equal to the normal quantum discord and the equivalent condition given in theorem [ thm : zerosuperdiscord ] , we guess that the super quantum discord really catch the non - classical correlation of the rra scheme on both side .    in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the state ( [ rho ] ) in zero `` left '' discord cases .",
    "since `` right '' discord is always presented in the quantum system , and super discord is larger than normal discord , we have `` right '' super discord must be presented in the scheme . as is shown in @xcite , in the cases of",
    "the `` left '' discord disappears , the following three items must be satisfied : @xmath69 is a real number , and @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ; @xmath72 and the case is indeed the optimal assisted state discrimination . for convenience , we set @xmath73 be a real number .",

    "when @xmath93 , the weak measurement reduces to the strong measurement and the super discord approach to normal discord .",
    "an interesting fact is that the normal discord and entanglement are always zero in this optimal case .",
