    "the characterization of unknown quantum states is an important experimental task and of great significance to quantum information processing @xcite . in conventional quantum - state tomography @xcite",
    ", the quantum state is reconstructed from expectation values obtained from strong measurements of different observables , performed on an ensemble of identically prepared systems .",
    "an alternative approach to quantum - state measurement @xcite uses a combination of weak and strong measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared systems , together with the concept of weak values @xcite .",
    "however , since both approaches require an ensemble of identically prepared systems , they can only be said to reconstruct the quantum state in the statistical sense of measurement averages over an ensemble of systems presumed to have been prepared in the same quantum state .",
    "this raises the question of whether it might be possible to determine the quantum state of an individual system from measurements carried out not on an ensemble but on this single system only .",
    "such single - system state determination would not only offer a conceptually transparent and rigorous version of quantum - state measurement , but also avoid time - consuming postprocessing and error propagation associated with quantum - state tomography @xcite .",
    "as long as one demands perfect fidelity of the state reconstruction and possesses no prior knowledge of the initial quantum - state subspace , then it is well known that single - system state determination is impossible @xcite . however ,",
    "if one weakens these conditions , then it has been shown that one can , in principle , measure the quantum state of a single system by using the protective - measurement protocol @xcite .",
    "protective measurement allows for a set of expectation values to be obtained from weak measurements performed on the same single system , provided the system is initially in an ( potentially unknown ) nondegenerate eigenstate of its ( potentially unknown ) hamiltonian .",
    "a defining feature of a protective measurement is that the disturbance of the system s quantum state during the measurement can be made arbitrarily small by weakening the measurement interaction and increasing the measurement time @xcite .",
    "thus , a series of expectation values can be measured on the same system while the system remains in its initial state with probability arbitrarily close to unity . in this sense , one can measure the quantum state of a single system with a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity @xcite , providing an important complementary approach to conventional quantum - state tomography based on ensembles .",
    "recently , the possibility of using protective measurement for quantum - state determination has attracted renewed interest @xcite , and protective measurement has been shown to have many related applications , such as the determination of stationary states @xcite , investigation of particle trajectories @xcite , translation of ergodicity into the quantum realm @xcite , studies of fundamental issues of quantum measurement @xcite , and the complete description of two - state thermal ensembles @xcite .",
    "the fact that each protective measurement has a nonzero probability of disturbing the quantum state of the measured system leads to error propagation and reduced fidelity over the course of the multiple measurements required to determine the set of expectation values @xcite .",
    "therefore , a chief goal when using protective measurement to characterize quantum states of single systems is the minimization of the state disturbance .",
    "however , the conventional approach of making the measurement interaction arbitrarily weak while allowing it to last for an arbitrarily long time @xcite is not only unlikely to be practical in an experimental setting but is also , as we will show in this paper , comparably ineffective . here",
    "we will describe a dramatically more effective approach that allows one to minimize the state disturbance while keeping the strength and duration of the measurement interaction constant . in this way",
    ", we demonstrate how to optimally implement the measurement of an unknown quantum state of a single system using protective measurement .",
    "our approach consists of a systematic tuning of the time dependence of the measurement interaction , such that the state disturbance becomes dramatically reduced even for modestly weak and relatively short interactions .",
    "while early expositions of protective measurement @xcite had hinted at the role of the time dependence of the measurement interaction , this role had not been explicitly explored and was instead relegated to a reference to the quantum adiabatic theorem @xcite , which , as we will see in this paper , provides a condition that is neither necessary nor sufficient for minimizing the state disturbance in a protective measurement .",
    "issues of time dependence of the protective - measurement interaction were first considered explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite , which estimated the effect of the turn - on and turnoff of the measurement interaction on the adiabaticity of the interaction .",
    "recently , the case of finite measurement times in a protective measurement and its influence on the reliability of the measurement were studied @xcite , and a framework for the perturbative treatment of time - dependent measurement interactions in a protective measurement has been developed and applied to specific examples @xcite .",
    "none of these existing studies , however , have shown how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in a protective measurement for the physically and experimentally relevant case of finite measurement times and interaction strengths , such that the reliability of the protective measurement can be maximized .    here",
    "we present a rigorous and comprehensive solution to this problem .",
    "our results demonstrate how one can optimally measure the quantum state of an individual quantum system using protective measurements . in any future experimental implementation of protective quantum - state measurement",
    ", this will enable one to optimize the measurement interaction to produce a high fidelity of the quantum - state measurement .",
    "while our analysis is motivated by the goal of optimizing protective measurements , it also provides insights into the issue of state disturbance in any quantum measurement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a brief review of the basics of protective measurements involving time - dependent measurement interactions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : prot - meas ] ) , we first use a fourier - like series approach to construct measurement interactions that achieve a state disturbance that decreases as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the measurement time and @xmath3 can be made arbitrarily large by modifying the functional form of the time dependence of the measurement interaction using a systematic procedure ( sec .  [ sec : seri - appr - minim ] ) .",
    "we also make precise the relationship between the smoothness of the measurement interaction and the dependence of the state disturbance on @xmath2 .",
    "we then show that the measurement interaction can be further optimized , leading to an even faster , subexponential decay of the state disturbance with @xmath2 , and we show that this constitutes the optimal choice ( sec .",
    "[ sec : minim - state - dist ] ) .",
    "these results are established by calculating the state disturbance from the perturbative transition amplitude to first order in the interaction strength . to justify this approach , we prove that this amplitude accurately represents the exact transition amplitude to leading order in @xmath0 ( sec .  [ sec : suff - first - order ] ) .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing protective measurements and their treatment with time - dependent perturbation theory . in a protective measurement @xcite",
    ", the interaction between system @xmath4 and apparatus @xmath5 is treated quantum mechanically and described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an arbitrary observable of @xmath4 , @xmath8 generates the shift of the pointer of @xmath5 , and the coupling function @xmath9 describes the time dependence of the interaction strength during the measurement interval @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath9 is normalized , @xmath14 , which introduces an inverse relationship between the duration @xmath2 and the average strength of the interaction , so that the pointer shift depends neither on these two parameters nor on the functional form of @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath15 of @xmath16 is assumed to be nondegenerate and @xmath4 is assumed to be in an eigenstate @xmath17 of @xmath16 at @xmath18 .",
    "one can then show @xcite that for @xmath19 the system remains in the state @xmath17 , while the apparatus pointer shifts by an amount proportional to @xmath20 , thus providing partial information about @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the realistic case of finite @xmath2 and a corresponding non - infinitesimal average interaction strength , the system becomes entangled with the apparatus , disturbing the initial state @xcite .    to quantify this state disturbance",
    ", we calculate the probability amplitude @xmath21 for finding the system in an orthogonal state @xmath22 at the conclusion of the measurement .",

    "our first approach will consist of building up coupling functions @xmath9 from sinusoidal components such that the coupling functions become increasingly smooth ( in a sense to be defined below ) .",

    "that is , we write @xmath9 as @xmath37 where the coefficients @xmath38 are dimensionless and do not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath39 , the area under @xmath9 is normalized as required .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath40 term describing a gradual increase and decrease .",

    "hence we may replace the sine function by 1 , in which case eqs .   and become identical .",
    "thus , to leading order in @xmath51 , the first - order transition probability @xmath102 accurately describes the state disturbance .",
    "this offers an important calculational advantage and enables the analysis of state disturbance in terms of properties of fourier - transform pairs .",
    "a particularly intriguing application of protective measurement is the possibility of characterizing the quantum state of a single system from a set of protectively measured expectation values .",
    "while this approach is intrinsically limited by its requirement that the system initially be in an eigenstate of its hamiltonian @xcite , it has the distinct conceptual and practical advantage of not requiring ensembles of identically prepared systems , in contrast with conventional quantum - state tomography based on strong @xcite or weak @xcite measurements .",
    "thus , it provides an important alternative and complementary strategy for quantum - state measurement @xcite .    to successfully characterize the initial state of the system with protective measurements , it is crucial that the initial state of the system is minimally disturbed during the series of protective measurements that determine the set of expectation values .",
    "we have shown how one can minimize this state disturbance , given a fixed duration @xmath2 and average strength ( @xmath103 ) of each protective measurement .",
    "specifically , we have described a systematic procedure for designing the time dependence of the system  apparatus interaction ( described by the coupling function ) such that the state disturbance decreases polynomially or subexponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "the leading order in @xmath0 can be made arbitrarily large for polynomial decay , and one may also come arbitrarily close to exponential - decay behavior by using bump functions .",
    "since strictly exponential decay can not be attained , bump functions are the optimal choice , as they produce the least possible state disturbance in a protective measurement .",
    "previous discussions of protective measurement @xcite have appealed to the condition that the coupling function change slowly during the measurement such that the quantum adiabatic theorem @xcite can be applied .",
    "but our results indicate that this condition is both too weak and too strict .",
    "it is too weak , because it concerns only the smallness of the first - order derivative of the coupling function , rather than the number of continuous derivatives .",
    "it is too strict , because our analysis shows that the state disturbance in a protective measurement is chiefly due to discontinuities in the coupling function and its derivatives during the turn - on and turnoff of the measurement interaction .",
    "once a sufficiently smooth turn - on and turnoff is achieved , the interaction strength may be changed comparably rapidly during the remaining period without creating significant additional state disturbance .",
    "thus , the reduction of the state disturbance through an optimization of the coupling function does not necessitate adjustment of the measurement time or average interaction strength .",
    "furthermore , compared to the condition of smoothness , the weakness of the interaction has a small effect on the state disturbance , which depends only quadratically on the average interaction strength .",
    "the optimization procedure described here is very general , because it solely modifies the time dependence of the coupling function and is independent of the physical details of the system and the apparatus . in particular , it is independent of the hamiltonian and the measured observable .",
    "this raises the question of whether and how one might further improve the fidelity of the state measurement if the specifics of the physical system and measured observables are taken into account .",
    "one approach would be to make use of any available partial knowledge of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "such knowledge may be used to additionally reduce the state disturbance , since then the system  apparatus interaction can be designed to target the partially known eigenspaces of the hamiltonian . in this case , one may also be able to reduce particular transition amplitudes by minimizing some of the transition matrix elements @xmath104 [ see eqs .   and ] .",
    "however , this approach can be expected to succeed only for a subset of eigenstates and very few particular choices ( if any ) of observables @xmath7 , while state determination requires the protective measurement of multiple complementary ( and practically measurable ) observables .    in summary , we have shown how to optimally implement protective measurements and thereby maximize the likelihood of success of protective measurements that seek to determine the quantum state of single systems .",
    "our results dramatically improve the performance of protective measurements and may aid in their future experimental realization .",
