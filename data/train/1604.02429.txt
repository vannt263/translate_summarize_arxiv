    "spintronics , the study of the interplay between the electrical transport and magnetic properties of magnetically ordered solids , has made steady progress over the past few decades .",
    "spintronics involves both phenomena like giant magnetoresistance in which transport properties are influenced by magnetic order configurations , and phenomena like spin - transfer torques in which transport currents can be used to modify magnetic configurations .",
    "pure spin currents , which do not involve charge flow , are routinely detected via the spin - transfer torques they exert on magnetic condensates and the electrical signals they give rise to when spins accumulate near sample boundaries or at electrodes .",
    "there are hopes that spin - currents have advantages over charge currents that can be exploited to enable faster or lower power electronic devices . in this chapter",
    "we discuss the notion of spin - superfluidity in thin film magnetic systems , either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic and either metallic or insulating , that have approximate easy - plane magnetic order @xcite . in spintronics",
    "spin - superfluidity refers to the capacity for spin currents to be carried without dissipation by a metastable configuration of a magnetic condensate , rather than by an electron or magnon quasiparticle current .",
    "our chapter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the concept of spin superfluidity using the common language of magnetism researchers by applying landau - lifshitz equations to easy - plane magnets . to motivate the spin - superfluidity concept",
    ", we compare the spin - transport properties of easy - plane magnets to the matter transport properties of an ideal classical fluid . at the end of the section",
    "we discuss some similarities and differences between easy - plane ferromagnets and bec systems . in sec .",
    "3 we discuss perpendicular spin injection in finite - size easy - plane magnetic systems .",
    "we then show that spin superfluids can exhibit josephson - like iv characteristics that arise ultimately from the topological stability of easy - plane magnetic order in thin films .",
    "finally , we discuss potential applications of this behavior , and also the influence in realistic materials of magneto - static interactions , magneto - crystalline anisotropy , and damped magnetization dynamics .",
    "we conclude in sec.4 with a discussion of the relationship between spin - superfluidity in easy - plane magnetic systems and superconductivity in metals .",
    "this chapter is closely related to the chapter on spintronics and magnon bose - einstein condensation by duine , brataas , bender , and tserkovnyak , elsewhere in this volume .",
    "both chapters are motivated by advances in spintronics that allow spin - currents to be routinely passed between different materials , including between metals and insulators .",
    "the phenomena that are addressed in the magnon bose - einstein condensation chapter occur in easy - axis magnetic systems that are driven electrically into a quasi - equilibrium steady state .      to simplify the following discussion we represent an ideal easy - plane magnet by the ginzberg - landau free energy functional@xcite @xmath0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_fxymag ] the first two terms account for the magnetization magnitude and the ground state free energy .",
    "the third term is a magnetic stiffness energy @xmath1 that parameterizes the free energy cost of magnetization non - uniformity . in the easy - plane case of interest",
    ", @xmath2 is positive and the last term characterizes the free energy cost of magnetization that is not oriented in the easy - plane .",
    "this expression ignores anisotropy within the easy plane , which we restore later , and also the complex term with long - range non - locality that accounts for magnetostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetization @xmath3 is described by the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gyromagnetic ratio and we have assumed @xmath6 to be negative for electrons .",
    "the landau - lifshitz equation are valid when the magnetization varies slowly in space and time and can be derived in a variety of different ways , for example starting from a density - functional theory of the magnetically ordered state @xcite . using the free energy expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_fxymag ] the effective magnetic field that appears on the right - hand side of the landau - lifshitz equations and drives magnetization precession is @xmath7 it is sometimes stated that the landau - lifshitz equation is a classical equation which describes spin - angular momentum precession .",
    "however , we prefer to view it as a quantum equation which describes the collective quantum dynamics of a magnetic order parameter ; certainly its derivation is always quantum .",
    "it can be viewed as a classical equation only because the quantum spin - dynamics of a macroscopic magnetic condensate is classical . in modern spintronics , the quantum nature of this equation",
    "is revealed by the appearance of @xmath8 in the relationship between classical precession frequencies and spin electromotive forces @xcite .",
    "the classical ground state of the easy plane ferromagnet has uniform in - plane magnetization . for small deviations from this classical ground state we parametrize @xmath3 as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "in this limit , which we assume below , the landau - lifshitz equations take the form @xmath11 ( we have ignored terms that are higher order in the small quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ) note that the 2nd equation can be recognized as a continuity equation for @xmath13 . in this interpretation",
    "the current corresponding to @xmath13 is the collective spin current @xmath14 the continuity equation is a direct consequence of the conservation of @xmath13 in an ideal easy - plane ferromagnet , _",
    "i.e. _ of the property that the ginzburg - landau energy is invariant under rotations around the @xmath15-axis in magnetization space .",
    "as we discuss further below , a dissipationless spin current described by eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_jmacro ] flows through the system when the system has nonzero @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "sonin @xcite has proposed a helpful analogy between a magnetic system carrying a dissipationless spin - current and a rod that is twisted around its axis .",
    "the rod will rotate globally when a torque is applied at one end unless an opposite torque is applied at the other end .",
    "although the net force on every individual atom in a twisted rod with balanced torques vanishes , the two torques can be viewed as giving rise to a uniform angular momentum flux , an angular momentum supercurrent , which passes through the cross section of the rod and transmits a torque applied at one end to the other end , where it is compensated .",
    "the non - local relationship between remote ends of the rod is supported by the rigidity of the rod , just as the non - local relationship between spin currents injected at opposite ends of an easy - plane magnet on which we focus is supported by the magnetic order parameter rigidity .",
    "it is important to observe that all the spin - supercurrent phenomena in equilibrium easy - plane magnets that we comment on in this chapter have an alternate description solely in terms of the spin - torque language commonly used in spintronics , which applies to any magnetic system and is therefore more general .",
    "the analogy with superfluid phenomena is restricted to magnetic systems with easy - plane order , but is interesting nevertheless because of the properties it suggests , and because of the light it sheds on the relationship between the collective phenomena studied in superfluids and superconductors and those studied in modern magnetism research , in particular in spintronics .",
    "the conversion between normal metal currents and cooper pair currents via andreev scattering @xcite , which is important in mesoscopic superconductivity , is simply the easy - plane limit of the spin - transfer torque concept so central in modern spintronics @xcite .",
    "to better explain the relationship of spin superfluidity to other superfluid phenomena , we now briefly summarize some key properties of fluids and superfluids .",
    "part of the reason why easy - plane magnetic systems are usefully viewed as being _ super _ is that their properties are in compliance with the conventional definition of ideal fluids ",
    "fluids without viscosity and thermal conductivity ( adiabatic ) .",
    "ideal fluids can be simply described by newton s 2nd law , which is known in fluid dynamics as euler s equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the velocity of an elemental volume of a fluid , @xmath18 is the density of the fluid , and @xmath19 is the pressure . note that the left hand side is simply @xmath20 .",
    "an ideal fluid has an important property , referred to as kelvin s theorem @xcite , that the velocity circulation is time independent .",
    "( the velocity circulation is defined as the line integral of the velocity around any closed loop in the fluid . )",
    "we emphasize later that a related property is essential to the stability of supercurrent states in superfluids .",
    "for now we consider the case when the velocity circulation is zero , which means that the vorticity @xmath21 vanishes identically everywhere in the fluid",
    ". then one can always find a scalar function @xmath22 whose gradient is equal to the velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 eq .",
    "[ eq : jgradphi ] is similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_jmacro ] .",
    "moreover , one can derive from eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_conjeom ] an equation for @xmath24 that looks similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_eulereqn ] , with the pressure term in the latter replaced by a term proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "( we will return to this point in the next subsection . )",
    "thus an easy plane ferromagnet can indeed be viewed as an ideal fluid with density proportional to the perpendicular component of the magnetization .    in the following",
    "we focus our attention on thin film systems in which the magnetization direction depends only on two spatial coordinates , since this is normally the case of greatest practical interest .",
    "the analogies we make will therefore be between thin film magnets and two - dimensional fluids .",
    "what is different between an easy - plane - magnet quantum superfluids and the classical ideal fluid is that the velocity potential @xmath22 is identified as a phase or azimuthal orientation angle in the quantum case .",
    "the line integral of the phase or angle gradient over any closed loop must then be an integer multiple of @xmath25 .",
    "this circulation quantization leads to vortices , topological defects carrying nonzero circulation quanta .",
    "since circulation is conserved in the bulk of an ideal fluid , a vortex will remain stable unless it reaches the boundary of the fluid where circulation is not well defined , or it annihilates with another vortex with opposite circulation . in circular coordinates @xmath26 a vortex with circulation @xmath27 can be represented by the velocity field @xmath28 one can then estimate the kinetic energy associated with a vortex by integrating @xmath29 over the whole fluid .",
    "it is easy to see that the energy of the vortex increases logarithmically with the system size .",
    "it follows that creation or annihilation of a vortex is associated with an unbounded energy change .",
    "moreover , under the assumption of zero viscosity and adiabaticity , creation and annihilation of vortices is the only way for a superfluid to relax from a metastable state with nonzero supercurrent to the zero current ground state . because the creation of these topological defects requires that large energy barriers be overcome , the current state of a superfluid is extraordinarily stable .",
    "it is instructive to consider the example in which we connect the two ends of a long thin ferromagnetic wire to form a ring , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chen_fig1 ]",
    ". the in - plane magnetization angle must then rotate by an integer multiple of @xmath25 as one moves around the ring to complete a cycle .",
    "provided that the total rotation angle is not zero , there is according to eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_jmacro ] a persistent spin supercurrent in the ring because of the nonzero azimuthal angle gradient .",
    "the topological stability of this spin supercurrent state is then obvious since it is not possible to change the angle winding number by locally perturbing the magnetization .",
    "this geometry is similar to the twisted rod example given earlier in this chapter , and is related to the celebrated rotating cylinder experiment in superfluid he@xmath30 .",
    "now imagine that a vortex with an angle winding of @xmath25 is nucleated at one boundary of the ring and moves across the width of the ring . the azimuthal angle change from one end of the sample to the other , measured along the direction perpendicular to the path of the vortex , changes by @xmath31 for every vortex which is nucleated on one edge of the ring , moves across , and is then annihilated at the other edge to restore a uniform superfluid .",
    "this _ phase slip _ is accompanied by a lower free energy when it reduces @xmath32 , and also a smaller spin supercurrent .",
    "the barrier for supercurrent relaxation is thus proportional to the vortex nucleation energy , and can greatly exceed @xmath33 because it is a collective barrier involving many electronic spins .",
    "a similar argument explains the metastability of currents in superconductors . in the interior of a magnetic vortex , the magnetization is rotated out of the easy plane , allowing the in - plane magnetization to vanish and @xmath22 to change discontinuously .",
    "the energy cost of creating vortices is therefore related in part to the strength of the easy - plane ansiotropy",
    ". a non - zero uniaxial anisotropy energy is essential for the stability of the spin supercurrent @xcite , as we emphasize again in the next subsection .",
    "as we have explained , the stability of supercurrent states in general superfluids can be understood in terms of the conservation of circulation , whether quantum or classical .",
    "however , we have not yet addressed the reason why the superfluids act like idea fluids , _",
    "i.e. _ why viscosity ( or dissipation ) is absent .",
    "this issue will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the prototypical superfluid , liquid he@xmath30 , is also a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "although the two concepts , superfluidity and bec , are not equivalent , nor is one necessarily the consequence of the other , they are intimately related . in this subsection",
    "we will discuss the relationship between bec and superfluidity , while at the same time making a comparison between bec and easy - plane magnetism .",
    "briefly , to avoid repeating material presented in earlier chapters , we define a bec as a state of matter in which a macroscopic number of bosonic particles share the same single - particle wavefunction . for simplicity",
    "we assume here that _ all _ particles are in the same state .",
    "one can then write the wavefunction of this state @xmath34 as a direct product of the single particle states @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath35 satisfies a mean - field schrdinger equation : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the chemical potential , and",
    "the last term is due to a weak interaction between particles .",
    "the factor @xmath39 in the last term reflects the fact that the effective interaction strength scales with the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "equation [ eq : chen_gpequation ] is called the ( time - dependent ) gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation@xcite and is is central to the earliest and also the most widely used microscopic theory of becs formed by weakly interacting bosonic particles .",
    "below we will absorb a @xmath40 factor into @xmath35 .",
    "the integral of @xmath41 over space is then the total number of particles in the condensate .",
    "we can therefore regard @xmath35 as the order parameter of the condensate and the gp equations as an equation for order parameter dynamics .",
    "below we emphasize its similarity to the landau - lifshitz equation for the order parameter dynamics of an easy - plane magnet .",
    "the close relationship between these two equations is of course not coincidental .    assuming the bec order parameter is a complex scalar function of position and time @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the density of the condensed particles , the time dependent gp equation can be rewritten as coupled equations for @xmath43 and @xmath22 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the 2nd equation has the form of continuity equation if the current is @xmath46 one can check that such a definition indeed agrees with that calculated from the standard formula @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , by taking the time derivative of @xmath48 and making use of the first equation in eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_gpnphi ] , we obtain @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which coincides with euler s equation for an ideal fluid , eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_eulereqn ] .",
    "thus the condensate is an ideal fluid , conserves velocity circulation , and is irrotational ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "moreover , its angular momentum must be carried by quantized vortices as we discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "( these conclusions apply only when the bec order parameter is a complex scalar function , and do not apply to spinor becs . )",
    "the landau - lifshitz equations of easy - plane magnets , eq .  [ eq : chen_conjeom ] , correspond to the gp equations of becs if we associate the term @xmath51 in the first equation of the former with @xmath52 .",
    "( the counterpart of the kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_gpnphi ] has been ignored in eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_conjeom ] which considered the spatially constant order parameter case . )",
    "it is then interesting to ask if this means that an easy - plane ferromagnet can also be viewed as a bec .",
    "below we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "let us start from a single macrospin with angular momentum @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a real number much larger than @xmath55 .",
    "taking the @xmath56 direction to be the quantization axis , the raising and lowering operators for the @xmath56-spin are written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the eigenstate of @xmath59 with the eigenvalue @xmath60 . letting @xmath61 act",
    "repeatedly on eigenstates of @xmath59 generates a set of states @xmath62 , which are eigenstates of @xmath59 with eigenvalues @xmath63 .",
    "one can then define a set of bosonic creation and annihilation operators acting on these fock states , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which decrease ( @xmath64 ) or increase ( @xmath65 ) the spin projection in @xmath56 direction by @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath66=1,\\\\\\nonumber & & a|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle,\\\\\\nonumber & & a^+|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related to @xmath67 and @xmath59 through the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite",
    "@xmath68    we first ignore magnetic anisotropy altogether by assumming for the moment that the hamiltonian commutes not only with the total spin component @xmath59 , as it does in ideal easy - plane ferromagnets , but also with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in this case",
    "all eigenstates occur in spin - multiplets and in the case of ferromagnets , the ground state multiplet has a macroscopic value of @xmath54 , proportional to the size of the system . now consider the ground state of an easy - plane ferromagnet , which should be an eigenstate of @xmath71 .",

    "the homogeneous spiral state in the absence of the easy - axis anisotropy is thus not a stable state of the system ; for any given phase gradient the system can lower its energy by locally rotating the in - plane polarization toward its easy axis , thereby distorting the simple spiral state .",
    "the collective spin supercurrent is nonuniform in space , with its divergence matching the rate of transverse spin creation or annihilation by the torque from the in - plane anisotropy .",
    "it is often still possible , however , to find metastable distorted spiral states which satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by spin - currents injected or absorbed at sample boundaries by solving a boundary value problem with neumann boundary conditions : @xmath116 strictly speaking the boundary conditions should include a spin torque term due to the easy - axis anisotropy at the boundary .",
    "however , since the torque contribution is an integral over the volume of the boundary layer , we can always ignore this term provided that the boundary layer is thin enough .",
    "an example of the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_pdeanix ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chen_fig2 ] .    since static solutions balance spatial variation in spin currents against the in - plane anisotropy torque ,",
    "it is clear that when the net current injection exceeds a value determined by the easy - axis anisotropy , a static solution may not be found .",
    "an estimate of the critical current imbalance can be made by assuming the stiffness @xmath117 is very large , so that both the wavelength of the spiral ( eq .  [ eq : chen_steadystate0 ] ) and the width of the domain wall @xmath118 greatly exceed the system size . in this macrospin limit eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_pdeanix ] reduces to @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the volume of the easy - plane ferromagnet and @xmath121 are the normal spin currents injected . in this limit",
    "the critical current imbalance is @xmath122 a discussion of the opposite limit that @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the length of a long easy - plane ferromagnet can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that static solutions are always available when the spin - current injected at one end of the sample is equal to the spin - current removed at the other end of the sample .",
    "the order parameter is not static when there are no metastable magnetic configurations that satisfy spin - injection boundary conditions . under such circumstances",
    "it is necessary to consider its damping .",
    "collective magnetization dynamics , including damping , is accurately described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation when magnetic order is well developed : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the gilbert damping parameter . taking the in - plane easy axis",
    "anisotropy into account , the llg equation in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath13 is @xmath127    solving eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_llganix ] in a finite system is challenging in general . here",
    "we only consider the macrospin limit and assume a steady state in which @xmath76 is spatially constant . for large easy - plane anisotropy",
    "this means that @xmath128 according to the @xmath76 equation in eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_llganix ] .",
    "we thus arrive at a single equation for @xmath22 : @xmath129 for @xmath130 . where @xmath131 , the solution is approximated by @xmath132 .",
    "when @xmath133 , @xmath134 has an additional oscillatory contribution .",
    "( _ cf . _ fig .",
    "1b in @xcite ) .",
    "an important consequence of having both in - plane anisotropy and gilbert damping in the easy - plane ferromagnet is that it is possible to drive the easy - plane ferromagnet across the transition between two very different spin - transport regimes .",
    "specifically , recall that the precession of the in - plane magnetization is equivalent to a spin - dependent chemical potential shift @xmath135 ( eq .  [ eq : chen_dotphiu ] ) . when the magnetization is static @xmath136 even for finite @xmath137 because of the easy - axis anisotropy within the easy plane , whereas in the steady precessing state @xmath138 , which can be very large when damping is small .",

    "the model can also be used to study spin superfluidity in antiferromagnets since the on - site interaction eq .",
    "[ eq : chen_hanimf ] is more likely to lead to antiferromagnetic ground state in equilibrium .",
    "a benefit of using the ferromagnetic tunnel junctions to inject spin currents into the easy - plane ferromagnet is that the size of the spin current is directly determined by the electric voltages applied across the junctions .",
    "the magnetization dynamics of the easy - plane ferromagnet influences transport through the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy stacks through the effect we mentioned at the end of the last subsection . by contacting two ferromagnetic tunnel junctions to the same easy - plane ferromagnet , it is possible to realize highly nonlinear and nonlocal current - voltage characteristics , particularly when the easy - plane ferromagnet is driven across the transition between static and precessing states .",

    "i.e. _ that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the tunnel conductance , @xmath144 is the bias voltage across the tunnel junction , and @xmath145 is a system dependent parameter characterizing the conversion efficiency between charge ( number ) current and spin ( @xmath13 ) current . when the in - plane magnetization of the easy - plane ferromagnet starts to precess ,",
    "@xmath144 will be shifted by @xmath146 in the rotating frame of the easy - plane ferromagnet .",

    "therefore for the device to be operational , the minimal voltage difference between the on and the off states is @xmath170 should satisfy @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath164 are in units of @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "this relation means that because of the collective nature of the switching phenomena , fundamental limits on conventional devices based on single electron behavior , can be circumvented .      in this chapter",
    "we have explained that ideal easy plane magnets can be viewed as equilibrium magnon bose - einstein condensates .",
    "magnon condensation in equilibrium differs qualitatively from condensation in systems with steady - state non - equilibrium populations of magnons , even when these partially thermalize .",
    "just as bose - einstein condensation occurs in systems with conserved particle number , ideal equilibrium magnon condensation occurs in easy - plane magnetic systems in which the perpendicular @xmath15 component of spin is a good quantum number . in these ideal systems",
    "a spiral magnetization configuration is metastable and carries a spin current without dissipation .    in realistic cases ,",
    "no component of spin is conserved .",
    "the concept of spin currents is nevertheless useful in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic metals , even though it is necessary to be cautious in using the spin current concept which is sometimes ambiguous .",
    "this is also true for easy plane magnetic systems regarded as spin superfluids .",
    "the spin - current contribution to collective spin - dynamics which is readily identified in ideal systems is still present in the landau - liftshitz equations , which are the magnetic analog of the gp equations .",
    "there are still metastable magnetization configurations which carry spin - currents without dissipation , although the spin - current is not spatially constant because of the influence of torques associated with weak anisotropy within the easy plane .",
    "the dissipationless spin supercurrents are responsible for non - local relationships between the i - v characteristics of remote magnetic circuits which are coupled only by interacting with the same magnetic condensate .",
    "it is instructive to compare the properties of a system in which a bias voltage is applied across a superconductor by normal metal leads connected to a power supply , a n - s - n system , with the properties of a system in which an easy - plane magnet is connected to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy leads . in the superconductor case",
    "the two normal metal leads do not normally have spin accumulation , _",
    "i.e. _ they do nt have well defined chemical potentials for @xmath175 and @xmath176 spins that are different . in the magnetic case , spin - accumulation is a common mechanism for the creation of spin - currents . a spin accumulation can be established either by illumination at a magnetic resonance frequency or by applying a charge bias voltage .",
    "the current which flows across a n - s interface is proportional to the chemical potential difference between the lead and the superconductor .",
    "the chemical potential of the superconductor is proportional to the time derivative of the condensate phase . in the steady state",
    "its value is adjusted so that the current flowing into the superconductor across one n - s interface is exactly equal to the current flowing out of the superconductor across the other n - s interface . in the macrospin limit",
    "the corresponding equation for the magnetic system is ( cf .",
    "[ eq : chen_fetprecessing ] ) @xmath177 the left hand side of this equation is effectively a chemical potential for magnons , measured from the ground state chemical potential .",
    "if @xmath162 in this equation is set to zero , the magnon chemical potential will adjust to guarantee that the spin - current injected at one end is emitted from the following end .",
    "the total spin - current which flows through the system will then depend only on the spin - accumulation difference between one end of the magnet and the other . in spintronics",
    "language @xmath178 is viewed as generating a spin - pumping contribution to the spin - currents at each end of the system .",
    "the properties of the n - s - n junction and the easy - plane magnetic system are therefore quite similar when @xmath162 is smaller than the electrode conductances .",
    "there is another route which allows spin - supercurrent behavior to be revealed . in the n - s - n circuit , only the chemical potential difference between the two n electrodes influences transport . in the magnetic case",
    "we have the ability to separately control the spin accumulations @xmath179 and @xmath158 and can for example choose their values such that the total injected current is below its critical value even when the individual injected currents are large in value . in this case",
    "the large spin currents injected at one contact do not excite magnetization dynamics only because of the large compensated spin - supercurrent injected at the other contact .",
    "the large spin - supercurrent is carried along the sample without dissipation .    in conclusion",
    "we point out that a number of considerations that are known to be important have not been extensively discussed in this brief chapter , and in some cases are only now being addressed in the literature . among these",
    "we mention in particular the role of long - range magnetostatic interactions , which are a serious complication in samples that are beyond the macrospin - limit in size , and the possibility of using easy - plane antiferromagnetic materials @xcite instead of ferromagnetic materials . in ferromagnets",
    "magnetostatic interactions tend to destabilize the homogeneous magnetic configurations from which the spiral configurations arise , in favor of configurations containing domains with different orientations .",
    "this problem is interesting but perhaps mainly academic since magnetostatic interactions are less important in smaller systems , and the largest interest is in exploiting spin superfluid properties in nanoscale spintronic devices .",
    "most of the observations made in this chapter apply equally well to ferromagnets and antiferromagnets , which have the advantages that magnetostatic interactions are absent and that dynamics are faster  possibly enabling spintronic devices that can be switched very rapidly .",
