    "a time projection chamber ( tpc , @xcite ) is proposed to be the main tracking device for the detector at the tesla collider @xcite . +",
    "our purpose is to study the tpc readout using gas electron multipliers ( gems , @xcite ) instead of conventionally used wire chambers to produce the gas amplification .",
    "gems offer several advantages : @xmath1 effects degrading the spatial resolution are strongly reduced , and the amount of required material in the endcap is low ; ion feedback into the drift volume leading to field distortion is naturally suppressed to a level of a few percent . due to the absence of ion tails in the pulse shape",
    "the use of gems improves the intrinsic two track resolution in the drift direction @xcite .",
    "+ in the following our present tpc test setups and the measurements are presented .",
    "* the setup * is shown in figure [ setup1 ] , left side .",
    "it consists of the field cage , the endplate with the gem module and two scintillators forming the trigger system @xcite .",
    "the readout is done using an @xmath2 flash adc .",
    "the chamber volume is filled with a gas mixture of @xmath3 argon , @xmath4 carbon dioxide and @xmath5 methane ( tesla tdr @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic muons are used as ionising particles .",
    "no magnetic field is applied ( @xmath6 ) .    1.0 cm    ( 8,3.5 ) ( -2.2,0.0 ) ( 6.,3.4 )",
    "the endplate contains the gem module consisting of two `` standard '' gems @xcite : a copper coated capton foil with holes of a double conical shape ( inner(outer ) diameter : @xmath7 ) and a pitch of @xmath8 .",
    "each foil has a size of @xmath9 .",
    "they are mounted in cascade with a gap of @xmath10 between the two gems ( transfer gap ) and between the gem and the array of readout pads , respectively ( induction gap ) .",
    "the corresponding fields are @xmath11 .",
    "+ our standard readout pads are rectangles of a size of @xmath12 , as proposed in the tesla tdr .",
    "according to simulations @xcite more sophisticated pad geometries may lead to a better point resolution due to larger charge sharing .",
    "therefore we also performed measurements using chevron shaped pads .",
    "since the studies are made without magnetic field , the pad sizes are scaled in @xmath13 according to the width of the charge cloud , governed by the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 . in the drift volume",
    ", @xmath15 holds true for our gas .",
    "thus , we use rectangles with an extension in @xmath13 of @xmath16 and the corresponding chevron size ( fig .",
    "[ setup1 ] , right ) . +",
    "* measurements : * some already intensively studied gem properties @xcite are verified for a tpc : the gas amplification depends exponentially on the applied voltages across the gems and the stability of the gain is satisfactory : the gain variation equals @xmath17 over a period of 70 hours . taking into account the correction for atmospheric pressure , we expect to reduce the variation to a value @xmath18 , which is needed to pin down the relative error @xmath19 below @xmath20 .",
    "the point resolution @xmath21 ( respectively @xmath22 ) is determined calculating the residuals @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the centre of charge of the 3 d electron cluster assuming a linear charge distribution and @xmath25 the coordinate calculated from the linear track fit , see figure [ res1 ] .",
    "the four left plots contain results of the small rectangular pads : @xmath13 and @xmath26 resolution as a function of the drift length ( upper plots ) : apart from very short drift distances , the charge cloud is larger than the pad size , and the resolution is dominated by diffusion . in @xmath13 , this leads to an overall worse result than expected for tesla ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the lower two plots show the degradation of the resolution with increasing track angle , due to the prolongation of the projection of the charge cloud on the corresponding coordinate ( @xmath13 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the right plot in figure [ res1 ] contains the results using large pads .",
    "the resolution @xmath21 is dominated by the pad size rather than by diffusion . for small drift distances",
    "the point resolution with chevrons is better than with rectangles .",
    "this effect of the pad geometry gets smaller with increasing drift distance .",
    "the corresponding resolution at tesla can be estimated by scaling down the measured resolution by the factor corresponding to the ratio of our pad sizes .    1.0 cm    ( 8.0,6.1 ) ( -3.5,3 . ) ( -3.3,-0.3 ) ( 4.3,-0.5 )      a side view sketch of the `` mini tpc '' @xcite can be seen in figure [ setup2 ] .",
    "it is built to measure the ion feedback and features a short drift distance ( @xmath28 ) making it possible to run at a moderate cathode voltage ( @xmath29 ) which allows the measurement of the cathode current @xmath30 ( in the order of few @xmath31 ) .",
    "dividing @xmath30 by the sum of all positive currents gives the ion feedback @xcite .",
    "the used gas mixture is the same as in the previous case ( tdr gas ) , the ionisation is produced by a radioactive iron source . in the plot of figure [ setup2 ] the ion feedback is shown as a function of the drift field .",
    "both induction and transfer field are adjusted to @xmath32 , the gem voltages are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for a drift field of @xmath35 ,",
    "as foreseen for the tesla detector , the feedback is @xmath36 .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 12.,4.3 ) ( -1.5,0.0 ) ( 8.,-0.7 )",
    "the future measurement programme includes gem operation in a magnetic field up to @xmath37 and tpc studies in the desy electron test beam ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the determination of the point resolution under more realistic conditions will be possible and it is planned to study the two track resolution .",
    "resolution studies will also be carried out with different gem tower geometries .",
    "simulations will accompany the measurement programme .",
    "studies on the gem readout for the tesla tpc are performed .",
    "the gain variation without correction for atmospheric pressure is lower than @xmath39 which is promising for @xmath40 measurements .",
    "resolution studies in @xmath13 with @xmath6 show different behaviour of rectangular and chevron pads favouring chevrons especially for short drift distances .",
    "the @xmath26 resolution is @xmath41 .",
    "it has to be taken into account that resolution measurements depend strongly on the diffusion  thus on the gas mixture and on the geometry of the gem tower .",
    "finally , for a double gem structure , the ion feedback is determined to be in the order of a few percent .",
