    "the problem of the possibility of a local realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics was first addressed in the discussion between einstein , podolsky , rosen ( epr )  @xcite and bohr  @xcite . in order to settle down the philosophical debate , bell proposed an experimental scheme in 1964  @xcite .",
    "bell s seminal paper contains an inequality , which holds for local realistic correlations but can be violated by quantum mechanical correlations . in the work of clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh )  @xcite a new inequality",
    "was derived , which , comparing with the original bell s expression , can be more applicable to real experimental setups .",
    "an inequality with lower - order ( partial ) correlations is usually called a clauser - horne - type ( ch - type ) bell inequality , whereas an inequality involving only highest - order ( full ) correlations is usually referred to as a chsh - type bell inequalities .    to identify quantum nonlocality ( qn )",
    ", one needs a set of complementary observables for each party .",
    "it is anticipated that the ability to detect qn becomes stronger as the number of observables ( settings ) increases .",
    "for instance , the 2-setting chsh inequality determines the visibility for the werner state as @xmath1 , while a 465-setting inequality  @xcite decreases the visibility to 0.7056 , which is slightly smaller than @xmath1 .    on the other hand , although the chsh inequality can detect the qn for all two - qubit pure entangled states , for more parties it is not desirable to invoke the full - correlation inequality , like the chsh inequality . in fact , the first bell inequality to identify qn for the whole domain of the generalized greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath2 is comprised of partial correlations .    in general , in constructing bell inequalities",
    "there is a trade - off between full correlations and the ability to detect qn for more generalized states .",
    "wu and ukowski  @xcite show how to transform a ch - type inequality into a chsh - type inequality , the tightness being preserved . in this paper , we use the procedure of homogenization to compare the quantum violation for various states . through the homogenization , the setting for each party",
    "is increased by one .",
    "this strengthens the quantum violation for the maximally entangled state , while the violation regimes for the nonmaximally entangled state could be narrowed .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the procedure of homogenization . then , in sec .",
    "iii , we focus on the generalized ghz state and compare its quantum violation of the hardy inequality before and after the homogenization . likewise , in sec .",
    "iv we study the influence of the homogenization on a family of tight bell inequalities without quantum violation .",
    "we discuss the results in sec .",
    "v and propose a possible reason for the enhanced qn by the homogenization .",
    "in general , the chsh- and ch - type inequalities read @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real coefficients , @xmath9 is a real constant , @xmath10 is the classical upperbound of ( [ ch ] ) , and @xmath11 are dichotomic observables taking values @xmath12 .",
    "wu and ukowski  @xcite showed that ( [ ch ] ) can be transformed into ( [ chsh ] ) by homogenization , and that if ( [ ch ] ) is tight then ( [ chsh ] ) is also tight .",
    "specifically , the homogeneous expression is obtained as @xmath13 with @xmath14",
    "cereceda  @xcite extend hardy s nonlocality proof for two spin-1/2 particles  @xcite to the case of @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles configured in the generalized ghz state .",
    "we now show that the maximal quantum violation of the homogenized hardy s inequality is stronger than hardy s original inequality .",
    "the @xmath0-qubit ch - type hardy s inequality reads  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the joint probability of obtaining result @xmath17 under setting @xmath18 for the @xmath19-th qubit , with @xmath20 and @xmath19 running from @xmath21 to @xmath0 . in the following context the subscript for each party",
    "could be omitted with no confusion .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ hardy - n ] ) in the form of correlations . for @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are observables for the first party , and likewise for @xmath26 .",
    "it is violated by the three - qubit ghz state by a factor of 1.1755 , and it is violated maximally by the state @xmath27 by a factor of 1.236 . in presence of noise ,",
    "the state is a mixed state defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is called visibility , @xmath30 for three qubits , and @xmath31 is the @xmath32 identity matrix . for the ghz state ,",

    "the homogenized inequality can be written as @xmath33 it is violated maximally by the three - qubit ghz state by a factor of 1.8 ( see fig .  1 ) , the threshold visibility @xmath29 is 0.5556 .    for @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath35 it is violated by the four - qubit ghz state by a factor of 1.0690 , it is violated maximally by a certain state by a factor of 1.1665 . on account of noise",

    "the quantum correlations ( qc ) are in general more stronger than classical correlations ( cc ) .",

    "@xcite showed how unextendable product bases ( upbs ) that satisfy a given requirement give rise to a family of tight bell inequalities without quantum violation . in these situations ,",
    "qc and cc perform equally well in information tasks , while the supraquantum nonsignaling correlations do provide an advantage over cc .",

    "to summarize , we have studied the influence of homogenization on enhancing the quantum nonlocality of two families of bell inequalities . through the homogenization ,",
    "the quantum violation of the hardy inequality has become stronger for the ghz state , while the parameter domain for violation regime of the generalized ghz state has been narrowed . on the other hand",
    ", quantum violation has appeared again for the family of tight bell inequalities without quantum violation .",
    "the reason for this is that a tight bell inequality without quantum violation can be represented by a _",
    "complete _ graph  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , i.e. , event probabilities are pairwise exclusive , so that , according to graph theory , the independence number is equal to the lovsz number  @xcite , indicating the coincidence of the classical upperbound with the quantum maximum . however , by homogenization",
    ", it is transformed into a full - correlation form , whose corresponding graph is no longer complete . in this regard ,",
    "the independence number is in general less than than the lovsz number , rendering a quantum violation possible .",
