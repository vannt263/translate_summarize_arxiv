    "in mesoscopic range phase coherence of electronic states is of fundamental importance and the existence of dissipationless current in a mesoscopic conducting ring threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux @xmath0 is a spectacular consequence of quantum phase coherence .",
    "the existence of persistent current in mesoscopic rings has been addressed several years ago in the pioneering work of bttiker , imry and landauer  @xcite .",
    "later , many excellent experiments  @xcite have been done in different systems to reveal the phenomenon of persistent current .",
    "though in literature many theoretical  @xcite as well as experimental papers  @xcite on persistent current are available , yet lot of controversies are still present between the theory and experiment , and the complete knowledge about it in this scale is not very well established even today .",
    "the unexpectedly large amplitudes of measured currents provide to the most important controversy .",
    "it has been proposed that the electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions contribute significantly to the average currents .",
    "an explanation based on the perturbative calculation in presence of interaction and disorder has been proposed and it seems to give a quantitative estimate closer to the experimental results , but still it is less than the measured currents by an order of magnitude , and the interaction parameter used in the theory is not well understood physically . though an attempt has been made to explain the enhancement of current amplitude by some theoretical arguments but the sign of low - field currents can not be predicted precisely and it is an important controversial issue between theoretical and experimental results .    motivated with these open challenges in the present paper we address magnetic response in mesoscopic hubbard rings threaded by ab flux @xmath0 .",
    "we try to propose an idea to remove the unexpected discrepancy between the calculated and measured current amplitudes by incorporating the effect of second - neighbor hopping ( snh ) in addition to the traditional nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) integral in the tight - binding hamiltonian . using a generalized hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation  @xcite ,",
    "we numerically compute persistent current ( @xmath1 ) , drude weight ( @xmath2 ) and low - field magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath3 ) as functions of ab flux @xmath0 , total number of electrons @xmath4 and system size @xmath5 .",
    "with this ( hf ) approach one can study magnetic response in a much larger system since here a many - body hamiltonian is decoupled into two effective one - body hamiltonians .",
    "one is associated with up spin electrons and other is related to down spin electrons .",
    "but the point is that , the results calculated using generalized hf mean - field theory may deviate from exact results with the reduction of    dimensionality .",
    "so we should take care about the mean - field calculation , specially , in one - dimensional systems . to trust our predictions , in the present work",
    "also we make a comparative study between the results obtained from mean - field theory and exactly diagonalizing the full many - body hamiltonian . the later approach where a complete many - body hamiltonian is diagonalized to get energy eigenvalues",
    "is not suitable to study magnetic response in larger systems since the size of the matrices increases very sharply with the total number of up and down spin electrons .",
    "our results can be utilized to explore magnetic response in any interacting mesoscopic system .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . following a brief introduction ( section i ) , in section",

    "kohn  @xcite has shown that for an insulating system @xmath2 decays exponentially to zero , while it becomes finite for a conducting system .",
    "the general expression of magnetic susceptibility @xmath3 at any flux @xmath0 is written in the form , @xmath39 evaluating the sign of @xmath40 we can able to predict whether the current is paramagnetic or diamagnetic in nature . here",
    "we will determine @xmath40 only in the limit @xmath41 , since we are interested to know the magnetic response in the low - field limit .    in the present work",

    "it is observed that the ground state energy level shifts towards the positive energy and it becomes much flatter with the increase of the correlation strength @xmath20 .",
    "both for the two different ring sizes ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) the ground state energy levels vary periodically with ab flux @xmath0 , but a significant difference is observed in their periodicities depending on the oddness and evenness of the ring size @xmath5 . for @xmath51 ( even ) ,",

    "@xmath2 drops sharply to zero when @xmath20 becomes high .",

    "for these three choices of @xmath4 ,    the ring is always less than half - filled ( since @xmath68 ) and the ring is in the conducting phase irrespective of the correlation strength @xmath20 .",
    "now we try to justify the dependence of the hubbard strength @xmath20 on the electronic mobility for these different fillings . to understand the effect of @xmath20 on electron mobility here we measure a quantity called ` average spin density ' ( asd ) which is defined by the factor latexmath:[$\\sum_i     the site index and it runs from @xmath49 to @xmath5 . by calculating asd we can estimate the occupation probability of electrons in the ring and it supports us to explain whether the ring lies in the metallic phase or in the insulating one .",

    "[ ringspinden](b ) .",
    "it reveals that for these systems , ground state always supports an empty site and electron can move along the ring avoiding double occupancy of two different spin electrons at any site @xmath9 in the presence of e - e correlation which provides the metallic phase ( @xmath70 ) . for a fixed ring size and a particular strength of @xmath20 ,",
    "the asd increases as the filling is increased towards half - filling which is noticed by comparing the three different curves in fig .",
    "[ ringspinden](b ) . on the other hand , in the half - filled rings",

    "[ ringspinden](a ) , where the red , green and blue lines correspond to asds for the half - filled rings with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "thus , for low @xmath20 there is some finite probability of getting two opposite    spin electrons in a same site which allows electrons to move along the ring and the metallic phase is obtained .",
    "but for large @xmath20 , asd reaches to unity which means that each site is singly occupied either by an up or down spin electron with probability @xmath49 . in this case ground state",
    "does not support any empty site and due to strong repulsive e - e correlation one electron sitting in a site does not allow to come other electron with opposite spin from the neighboring site which provides the insulating phase ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to mott localization in one - dimensional infinite lattices . in perfect hubbard",
    "rings the conducting nature has been studied exactly quite a long ago using the ansatz of bethe by shastry and sutherland  @xcite .",
    "they have calculated charge stiffness constant ( @xmath72 ) and have predicted that @xmath72 goes to zero as the system approaches towards half - filling for any non - zero value of @xmath20 .",
    "our numerical results clearly justify their findings .",
    "now , we discuss the variation of low - field magnetic susceptibility which can be calculated from eq .",
    "[ equ8 ] by setting @xmath41 . with the help of this parameter we can justify whether the current is paramagnetic ( @xmath73ve slope ) or diamagnetic ( @xmath74ve slope ) in nature . for our illustrative purposes , in fig .",

    "figure  [ ringsuscep](a ) correspond to the variation    of low - field magnetic susceptibility for the non - interacting ( @xmath48 ) rings , where the ring size can by anything i.e. , either odd , following the relation @xmath75 ( @xmath33 is an integer ) , or even , obeying the expression @xmath76 .",
    "it is observed that both for odd and even @xmath5 , low - field current exhibits diamagnetic nature .",
    "the behavior of the low - field currents changes significantly when the e - e interaction is taken into account .",
    "depending on the ring size @xmath5 , the sign becomes @xmath73ve and @xmath74ve as shown by the curves given in figs .",
    "[ ringsuscep](b)-(d ) .",
    "for the interacting rings where the relation @xmath77 is satisfied , the low - field current becomes diamagnetic ( fig .",
    "[ ringsuscep](b ) ) .",
    "the sign becomes paramagnetic when @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ ringsuscep](c ) ) and @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ ringsuscep](d ) ) .",
    "thus , in brief , we say that for non - interacting half - filled rings low - field current exhibits diamagnetic response irrespective of @xmath5 i.e. , whether @xmath5 is odd or even . for the interacting half - filled rings with odd @xmath5 ,",
    "low - field current provides only the paramagnetic behavior , while for even @xmath5 , depending on the particular value of @xmath5 , the response becomes either diamagnetic or paramagnetic .",
    "these natures of low - field currents change for the cases of other electron fillings .",
    "hence , it can be emphasized that the behavior of the low - field currents is highly sensitive on the hubbard correlation , electron filling , evenness and oddness of @xmath5 , etc .",
    "the behavior of zero - field magnetic susceptibility in hubbard rings has been studied extensively quite a long back using the bethe ansatz by shiba  @xcite . in this work",
    ", he has studied magnetic    susceptibility per electron as functions of electron filling and hubbard correlation strength and provided several interesting results . from his findings",
    "we can clearly justify our presented results .",
    "finally , we explore the combined effect of electron - electron correlation and second - neighbor hopping ( snh ) integral on persistent current in disordered mesoscopic rings .    to get a disordered ring , we choose site energies ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) randomly from a  box \" distribution function of width @xmath81 .",
    "as the site energies are chosen randomly it is needed to consider the average over a large number of disordered configurations ( from the stand point of statistical average ) .",
    "here , we determine the currents by taking the average over @xmath64 random disordered configuration in each case to achieve much accurate results .    as illustrative examples , in fig .",
    "[ ringcurrsnh ] we display the variation of persistent currents for some single - channel mesoscopic rings considering @xmath82 electron filling . in ( a ) the results are given for the rings characterized by the nnh integral model .",
    "the red curve represents the current for the ordered ( @xmath83 ) non - interacting ( @xmath48 ) ring .",
    "it shows saw - tooth like nature with ab flux @xmath0 providing @xmath52 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "the situation becomes completely different when impurities are introduced in the ring as clearly seen by the other two colored curves .",
    "the green curve represents the current for the case only when impurities are considered but the effect of hubbard interaction is not taken into account .",
    "it varies continuously with @xmath0 and gets much reduced amplitude , even an order of magnitude , compared to the perfect case .",
    "this is due to the localization of the energy eigenstates in the presence of impurity , which is the so - called anderson localization .",
    "hence , a large difference exists between the current amplitudes of an ordered and disordered non - interacting rings and it was the main controversial issue among the theoretical and experimental predictions .",
    "experimental results suggest that the measured current amplitude is quite comparable to the theoretically estimated current amplitude in a perfect system . to remove this controversy , as a first attempt",
    ", we include the effect of hubbard interaction in the disordered ring described by the nnh model .",
    "the result is shown by the blue curve where @xmath20 is fixed at @xmath84 .",
    "it is observed that the current amplitude gets increased compared to the non - interacting disordered ring , though the increment is too small .",
    "not only that the enhancement can take place only for small values of @xmath20 , while for large enough @xmath20 the current amplitude rather decreases . this phenomenon can be explained as follows . for the non - interacting disordered ring",
    "the probability of getting two opposite spin electrons becomes higher at the atomic sites where the site energies are lower than the other sites since the electrons get pinned at the lower site energies to minimize the ground state energy , and this pinning of electrons becomes increased with the rise of impurity strength @xmath81 . as a result",
    "the mobility of electrons and hence the current amplitude gets reduced with the increase of impurity strength @xmath81 .",
    "now , if we introduce electronic correlation in the system then it tries to depin two opposite spin electrons those are situated together due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , the electronic mobility is enhanced which provides quite larger current amplitude .",
    "but , for large enough interaction strength , mobility of electrons gradually decreases due to the strong repulsive interaction .",
    "accordingly , the current amplitude gradually decreases with @xmath20 .",
    "so , in short , we can say that within the nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) model electron - electron interaction does not provide any significant contribution to enhance the current amplitude , and hence the controversy regarding the current amplitude still persists .    to overcome this controversy",
    ", finally we make an attempt by incorporating the effect of second - neighbor hopping ( snh ) integral in addition to the nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) integral . with this modification",
    "a significant change in current amplitude takes place which is clearly observed from fig .",
    "[ ringcurrsnh](b ) .",
    "the red curve refers to the current for the perfect ( @xmath83 ) non - interacting ( @xmath48 ) ring and it achieves much higher amplitude compared to the nnh model ( see red curve of fig .",
    "[ ringcurrsnh](a ) ) .",
    "this additional contribution comes from the snh integral since it allows electrons to hop further .",
    "the main focus of this sub - section is to interpret the combined effect of snh integral and hubbard correlation on the enhancement of persistent current in disordered ring . to do this first",
    "we narrate the effect of snh integral in disordered non - interacting ring .",
    "the nature of the current for this particular case is shown by the green curve of fig .",
    "[ ringcurrsnh](b ) .",
    "it shows that the current amplitude gets reduced compared to the perfect case ( red line ) , which is expected , but the reduction of the current amplitude is very small than the nnh integral model ( see green curve of fig .",
    "[ ringcurrsnh](a ) ) .",
    "this is due the fact that the snh integral tries to delocalize the electronic states , and therefore , the mobility of the electrons is enriched .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting when we include the effect of hubbard interaction .",
    "the behavior of the current in the presence of interaction is plotted by the blue curve of fig .",
    "[ ringcurrsnh](b ) where we fix @xmath85 . very interestingly",
    "we see that the current amplitude is enhanced moderately and quite comparable to that of the perfect cylinder .",
    "therefore , it can be predicted that the presence of snh integral and hubbard interaction can provide a persistent current which may be comparable to the measured current amplitudes . in this presentation",
    "we consider the effect of only snh integral in addition to the nnh model , and , illustrate how such a higher order hopping integral leads an important role on the enhancement of current amplitude in presence of hubbard correlation for disordered rings .",
    "instead of considering only the snh integral we can also take the contributions from all possible higher order hopping integrals with reduced hopping strengths . since the strengths of other higher order hopping integrals are too small , the contributions from these factors are reasonably small and they will not provide any significant change in the current amplitude . finally , we can say that further studies are needed by incorporating all these factors .",
    "to summarize , we have studied magnetic response in mesoscopic hubbard rings threaded by aharonov - bohm flux @xmath0 . using the generalized hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation ,",
    "we have numerically computed persistent current , drude weight , low - field magnetic susceptibility and some other related issues .",
    "most importantly , we have tried to implement an idea to remove the long standing problem between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted current amplitudes .",
    "we believe the present analysis is found to exhibit several interesting results which have so far remained unaddressed .",
