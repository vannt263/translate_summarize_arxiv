    "interacting electrons in one dimension form a non - fermi liquid state , usually called a luttinger liquid ( ll ) @xcite .",

    "one - dimensional situation in which the chains are weakly coupled to one another . in the context of organic conductors in particular ,",
    "the most relevant type of inter - chain coupling is an inter - chain hopping @xmath0 .",
    "the question that immediately arises is whether the luttinger liquid effects can be observed in quasi - one dimensional systems .",
    "the most naive answer would be that such systems are essentially two - dimensional , and perhaps fermi liquids , at energy scales lower than the interchain hopping term @xmath0 , but that at energies larger than this hopping the luttinger liquid effects survive .",
    "the renormalization group calculation supports this picture , but due to the effect of the interaction between electrons , the inter - chain hopping term is strongly renormalized @xcite and the crossover between the one - dimensional luttinger liquid and two - dimensional behavior takes place at the energy scale : @xmath1 in this expression , @xmath2 is the fermi energy of a single chain ( @xmath3 , the in - chain hopping ) and @xmath4 is the scaling dimension of the physical electron operator in the luttinger liquid . for a model with spin : @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the ll parameter in the charge sector .",

    "when interactions are strong ( @xmath11 i.e @xmath7 not too small ) , @xmath12 can be much smaller than the naive estimate @xmath13 , suggesting that ll behavior could be observable down to a much smaller energy ( temperature ) scale than the bare @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that the estimate ( [ estar ] ) does not take into account the effect of an intra - chain umklapp scattering .",
    "when relevant , this coupling tends to open a mott gap .",
    "one is thus faced with the more complicated situation of two relevant perturbations competing with each other , and this competition controls the physics of the dimensional crossover .",
    "it was recently pointed out@xcite that this may be an important consideration for the physics of the quasi one - dimensional organic conductors , even for the metallic compounds . a full understanding , in these compounds@xcite , of the crossover between the high energy ( temperature , frequency ) phase , likely to be indeed a luttinger liquid , and the low energy one is still lacking .",

    "here we generalize this theory to finite temperature and arbitrary fields ( including the physically important small field limit ) .",
    "there are several experimental motivations for the present work .",
    "inter - chain transport and optical measurements have been used as a probe of the in - chain physics in quasi - one dimensional organic conductors , and a critical discussion of the relevance of coupled luttinger liquid models to these measurements has been given recently by two of the authors @xcite .",
    "very recently , measurements of the hall effect in the bechgaard salt in two different geometries have been reported @xcite . while in - chain dissipation may be an important ingredient for the understanding of these experiments , the results of the present work for an ideal luttinger liquid provide a benchmark to which the experiments can be compared .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model and define the geometry that we consider . in sec.[gal ] , we prove some general properties of the hall effect in the absence of dissipation in the chains . in sec.[trcondac ] we calculate the transverse conductivity , and the optical hall angle .",
    "the main results are summarized in sec.[conclusion ] , where we also briefly discuss the possible consequences of in - chain dissipation .",
    "technical details can be found in the appendices .",
    "the geometry considered in this paper is depicted in figure  [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "we consider one - dimensional chains ( along the x - axis ) , coupled by a transverse hopping ( y - axis ) into a two - dimensional array .",
    "a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the array ( z - axis ) . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case of spinless electrons , and neglect the in - chain umklapp processes ( a legitimate assumption if the system is not at a commensurate filling ) .",
    "the main technical difficulty of this problem is that the hall conductivity of chains with a linear electron spectrum @xmath17 is zero due to the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "therefore to obtain a nontrivial answer it is necessary to consider a nonlinear correction to the spectrum @xmath18 thus the hamiltonian of the problem is @xmath19 \\label{ham0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a two - component vector composed from the right- and left - moving electrons @xmath21 , @xmath22 is a pauli matrix and @xmath23 .",
    "we use the landau gauge @xmath24 .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) corresponds to the nonlinear correction ( [ alphasp ] ) to the free electron spectrum .",

    "this will be fully clarified in the next section .",
    "in this section we show that , in the case where there is no dissipation in the chains , several aspects of the hall effect can be deduced from general principles . we first consider ( sec.[sec : galilee ] ) the limit where @xmath15 is taken to zero first , in which galilean invariance can be used .",
    "we then turn to non - zero frequency ( sec .",
    "[ commutation ] ) and use the commutation relation of the in - chain current operator and hamiltonian in order to obtain general expressions for the conductivity and resistivity tensors .",

    "we now envision a different setup in which no external electric field and no current are applied , and consider a reference frame that moves with respect to this system at a velocity @xmath37 along the @xmath36 axis . in this moving frame",

    "due to such a galilean transformation @xmath39 is still zero but an electric field is induced along the y - axis , given by : @xmath40 finally , in the moving frame , there is a current along the chains , which can be evaluated as follows .",
    "the velocity of right ( left ) moving modes close to the fermi surface is given by : @xmath41 , so that a constant velocity @xmath37 corresponds to a momentum shift @xmath42 .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a ( one -dimensional ) current density in a single chain given by : @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we obtain the induced current density along @xmath36 as : @xmath44 combining the above equations for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we finally obtain : @xmath47 this expression for the hall resistivity can also be written in terms of the electron density @xmath48 , which is related to the in - chain fermi momentum through the relation : @xmath49 ( since @xmath50 is the density per one chain ) . therefore : @xmath51 in the case of a purely parabolic band @xmath52 , one has @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that one recovers the familiar expression : @xmath55 for a tight - binding dispersion along the chains @xmath56 , one has @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so that : @xmath59 hence , we have seen that galilean invariance implies that the dc- hall resistivity is t - independent and unchanged by interactions .    in a similar way one can use the conductivity tensor @xmath60= \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\sigma_{xx } & \\sigma_{xy } \\\\",

    "@xmath66 which is a finite quantity ( at finite temperature ) that must be calculated independently ( sec . [ trcondac ] ) .",

    "finally , for the sake of completeness , we give the general expression of the conductivity tensor in terms of @xmath102 : @xmath103    from the equation relating @xmath74 and @xmath102 we see that at high enough frequency the effect of curvature becomes not important and @xmath104 assuming that @xmath105 is finite at zero frequency ( this is the case for any finite temperature ) we estimate the crossover frequency below which the curvature effects become important @xmath106 thus for frequencies higher than @xmath107 one can neglect the curvature effects and use the zero curvature result for transverse conductivity calculated in sec.[trcondac ] directly . at frequencies lower than @xmath107",
