    "the recent experimental observation of single - level peaks in excitation spectra of quantum dots @xcite has motivated theoretical interest in the problem of the quasiparticle life time induced by the coulomb interaction in mesoscopic samples @xcite .",
    "it was found that the single particle levels with excitation energy @xmath14 have widths less than the one - particle mean level spacing @xmath15 , and thus can be resolved .",
    "here @xmath16 is the thouless energy , which has the physical meaning of the inverse time of spreading of a wave packet over the system , the ratio @xmath17 being the dimensionless conductance of the dot .",
    "thus , the theory predicts that approximately the first @xmath18 single - particle levels can be resolved , in agreement with experimental findings @xcite . in a more recent paper @xcite , altshuler , gefen , kamenev and",
    "levitov ( agkl ) mapped the problem onto a tree - like tight - binding model in the fock space .",
    "this model is very close to the anderson tight - binding model on the bethe lattice , which was found @xcite to undergo the localization transition .",
    "this allowed agkl to conclude that there is a localization threshold @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in the problem , so that the states well below @xmath19 are strongly localized , i.e. given by the bare single - particle states with small perturbative admixture of many - particle states .",
    "the qualitative arguments used by agkl are not sufficient , however , for a more precise determination of the behavior of the spectral shape of the quasiparticle peak in the vicinity of the localization threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical behavior of the anderson model on the bethe lattice was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior found there is completely analogous to that obtained earlier for the bethe lattice version of the @xmath21-models @xcite which can be derived from wegner s @xmath22-orbital model with @xmath23 states per lattice site @xcite ( or , equivalently , considering a system of weakly coupled metallic granules @xcite ) .",
    "exactly the same type of the transition and critical behavior on the bethe lattice has been found @xcite in the `` toy '' version of the supersymmetric @xmath21-model introduced in @xcite , which is much simpler technically than the `` true '' @xmath21-models of localization . in ref.@xcite fluctuations of the local density of states ( ldos ) near the anderson transition",
    "were studied ; as we will see , this question is closely related to the subject under discussion .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the model derived by agkl via the supersymmetry technique .",
    "in fact , since many results for the critical behavior on the bethe lattice are already known , we have just to apply them to the present model , properly identifying parameters and quantities of interest . there are , however , new features , which require an additional investigation .",
    "first of all , the model of agkl has a large connectivity ( branching number ) @xmath24 .",
    "secondly , we will be interested in the structure of the local spectral function in energy space ; the question , which was not addressed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.[s2 ] we formulate the model as derived by agkl and identify the parameters and quantities to be studied .",
    "sec.[s4 ] is devoted to calculation of the average shape of the local spectral function on a bethe lattice with large branching number . in sec.[s4a ] we evaluate the magnitude of the ldos fluctuations in the region where these fluctuations are weak . in sec.[s3 ] we study the correlations of amplitudes of eigenstates on a tree - like lattice in the critical region .",
    "this information is used in sec.[s5 ] , where we study fluctuations of the local spectral function and its typical shape in the vicinity of the anderson transition , both in the phases of localized and extended states . in sec.[s5a ] we discuss application of this results to the problem of quasiparticle excitations in quantum dots .",
    "our results are summarized in sec.[s6 ] .",
    "for the sake of completeness and clarity , we recall the derivation of the model by agkl @xcite . to describe the system of interacting fermions one should study eigenstates @xmath25 of a generic many - body hamiltonian of @xmath26 pairwise interacting particles : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are energies of the corresponding single particle states . when one neglects the interaction @xmath29 the complete set of eigenstates is provided by slater determinants obtained from the filled fermi sea @xmath30 as @xmath31 as a result of interaction , the exact eigenstates @xmath25 for interacting particles",
    "are superpositions of the slater determinants @xmath32 .    to analyze the form of the line for single - particle excitations agkl suggested to consider the hierarchy of the many - body states in the fock space .",
    "let us consider the system with @xmath26 particles in its hartree - fock ground state @xmath33 .",
    "the first level of hierarchy is formed by states with one particle : @xmath34 , the third one by the states with three particles and two holes ( to be denoted as five - particle states ) and so forth .",
    "neither of these states ( which we denote generally as @xmath35 ) is an eigenstate of @xmath36 .",
    "therefore if an extra particle is added to the system in such a way that a single - particle state @xmath37 on the first level of hierarchy is formed , this state will decay to the states on the second level of hierarchy , which in turn may spread further in the fock space .",
    "the process of the spread may be looked at as a quantum diffusion of a fictitious particle on a graph whose vertices @xmath38 are formed by the states @xmath35 at different levels of hierarchy . as such",
    ", it can be described by an effective one - particle tight - binding model characterized by the hamiltonian : @xmath39 with `` site energies '' @xmath40 and hopping constants @xmath41 .",
    "let us note that a problem of decay of an isolated level to a dense band in a situation when the level is directly coupled only to a small fraction of the states of the continuum was studied by akulin and dykhne @xcite .",
    "though the model considered in @xcite is somewhat different from that studied in the present paper , many physical features are actually similar for both models . in particular , it was stressed in @xcite that the dynamics of level decay can by affected by the phenomenon of anderson localization .    the spectral shape of a quasiparticle peak is obtained by projecting the initial single - particle state @xmath37 onto exact eigenstates @xmath25 @xcite : @xmath42 if we now consider the state @xmath37 as a site of the tight - binding model , we see that @xmath43 is nothing else but the local density of states ( ldos ) in the point @xmath44 at energy @xmath45 , i.e. the fourier - transform @xmath46 of the overlap of the spreading wave function with the initial state @xmath37 . in another context",
    "this quantity is called the strength function and is frequently used in nuclear and atomic physics to characterize spectra of complex systems , see e.g. @xcite for recent applications and further information .",
    "the interaction matrix elements couple the states of each generation to those of the preceding and of the following generations .",
    "in particular , a single - particle state is connected with three - particles states , but not with five- , seven- ,  -particle ones .",
    "the density of one - particle states is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "since we are interested in the regime , where one - particle states can be resolved or , in other words , the width is less than @xmath15 , we can keep only the states with energies within a window ( @xmath48 ) containing just one single - particle state .",
    "the density of three - particle states at given energy @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the factor @xmath51 taking care of the identity of the quasiparticles .",
    "the ratio @xmath52 defines the effective branching number of the problem and is considered as a big parameter @xcite .",
    "the important fact observed by agkl is that this branching number stays parametrically the same for the following levels of hierarchy .",
    "for example , the density of the five - particle states @xmath53 and each of these states is connected with of order of one three - particle state ( in the chosen energy window of the width @xmath15 ) , whereas each three - particle state is connected to @xmath54 five - particle states .",
    "following agkl , we will neglect the change in numerical coefficients , and consider a tree structure with constant branching number @xmath24 ( bethe lattice ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the anderson model on the bethe lattice is determined essentially by the following three parameters : the branching number @xmath0 , the characteristic magnitude @xmath3 of the hopping matrix elements , and the width @xmath4 of the distribution of the random site energies @xmath55 .",
    "they are related to the parameters of the original ( quantum dot ) problem as follows .",
    "the connectivity @xmath0 is determined by the proliferation of the density of states from one level of the hierarchy to the next one , as discussed above : @xmath56 the characteristic value of the hopping matrix element is equal to @xcite @xmath57 finally , @xmath4 can be determined by equating the mean spacing of the states in the next level of the hierarchy connected to a given state , @xmath58 , to the corresponding quantity in the anderson model on the bethe lattice , @xmath59 .",
    "this yields : @xmath60 in order to check that restriction to the states in the energy interval @xmath15 is justified , we can modify the model by including all states from a broader energy window @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "then each three - particle state will be coupled to @xmath22 one - particle states ; each five - particle state to of order of @xmath22 three - particle states etc .",
    "this modified model thus resembles the @xmath22-orbital model on the bethe lattice .",
    "it has branching number given by the same expression ( [ e1b ] ) and the coupling constant @xcite @xmath63 , independent of @xmath22 , which confirms that @xmath22 is indeed an irrelevant parameter .",
    "equivalence of the @xmath22-orbital and the anderson ( @xmath64 ) models at @xmath65 will be discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the anderson model on the bethe lattice exhibits the anderson localization transition when one of control parameters @xmath66 varies . in our case , the change in the quasiparticle excitation energy @xmath45 implies , see eq.([e1b ] ) , the change of the branching number @xmath0 . such a phase transition is reflected in a drastic change of statistical properties of eigenfunctions . in our preceding publications @xcite we have discussed the distribution function of ldos and its typical spatial shape ( for given energy ) near the anderson transition .",
    "now , our interest is concentrated on a typical shape of @xmath43 in energy space , for a given `` point '' @xmath37 .",
    "in this section , we study the average form of the local spectral density @xmath43 in a site @xmath37 of a bethe lattice with large connectivity ( branching number ) @xmath24 .",
    "we consider for definiteness a model with site - diagonal disorder @xmath67 the averaging is performed over the random energies @xmath55 in all sites except the site @xmath37 , where the spectral density is studied .",
    "thus , we calculate the average form of the ldos in a site with given value @xmath68 of the random potential . the same object was studied previously in a random banded matrix model with strongly fluctuating diagonal elements @xcite .",
    "we will compare the results for the present case to those of the ref.@xcite in the end of the section .",
    "the average value of the ldos is given by : @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the solution to the following non - linear integral equation : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the distribution of the random site energies @xmath55 , and @xmath73 is the bessel function . we look for an approximate solution of eq.([e12 ] ) in a gaussian form",
    "@xmath74 substituting eq.([e13 ] ) in the r.h.s . of eq.([e12 ] )",
    ", we get @xmath75\\ , \\label{e14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 ^ 2 } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\left.\\left[\\int d\\epsilon\\gamma(\\epsilon ) { 1\\over mg_0-i(e-\\epsilon)/2}\\right]^2 \\right\\ } \\label{e15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]  from eqs.([e12 ] ) , ( [ e13 ] ) , and ( [ e14 ] ) we get an equation for @xmath77 : @xmath78 the ansatz ( [ e13 ] ) is justified if the @xmath79 correction in eq.([e14 ] ) can be neglected . since @xmath80 the integrals in the r.h.s . of eqs.([e11 ] ) , ( [ e12 ] ) are dominated by the region @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , according to eq.([e15 ] ) , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the @xmath83 term in eq.([e17 ] ) leads to a relative correction of order of @xmath84 , which is small in the case of large connectivity , @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , eq.([e13 ] ) is indeed the proper approximation for @xmath24 .",
    "now we will analyze eq.([e16 ] ) in the two regimes : ( i ) @xmath85 , and ( ii ) @xmath86 , where @xmath4 is a typical magnitude of the random energies @xmath55 . in the case ( i ) one can neglect @xmath77 in denominator of ( [ e16 ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath87 since a typical scale for @xmath88 is @xmath89 we find @xmath90 .",
    "we see that under the condition @xmath85 the quantity @xmath91 can be indeed neglected in the denominator of eq.([e16 ] ) as compared to @xmath92 .",
    "then the ldos , eq.([e11 ] ) , takes the breit  wigner form @xmath93 ( we neglected the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath0 in the second line ) , i.e. it is a lorentzian with a width @xmath95 the center of this lorentzian is determined by the local random energy @xmath68 ( slightly shifted by @xmath96 ) .",
    "the width @xmath97 is exactly the quasiparticle decay rate one would get by applying the fermi golden rule : it is equal to @xmath98 times matrix element @xmath3 squared times density of states into which the particle decays ( @xmath99 ) .    in the opposite case , @xmath86 , we can neglect @xmath100 in the denominator of eq.([e16 ] ) , which reduces then to @xmath101 we find therefore @xmath102 and @xmath103 thus , the ldos in this limit has a semicircular form .",
    "the width of the semicircle is of order of @xmath104 justifying omission of @xmath105 in the denominator of eq.([e16 ] ) .",
    "the crossover from the lorentzian to the semicircular shape of local dos is completely analogous to that found for the model of random banded matrices with strongly fluctuating diagonal elements @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this crossover is the same in both cases .",
    "when the disorder is sufficiently strong , an eigenstate is not spread uniformly over all the sites of the lattice , but rather is concentrated on a small fraction of lattice , formed by the sites which satisfy a kind of resonance condition with a given site @xmath37 .",
    "this leads to a lorentzian form of the ldos with a width @xmath97 much less than the width @xmath4 of the distribution of diagonal matrix elements ( random energies ) .",
    "position of this lorentzian for a site @xmath35 is determined essentially by the random energy @xmath55 .",
    "the weaker is the disorder the larger is @xmath97 .",
    "the crossover point is determined by the condition @xmath106 . for a still weaker disorder the ldos acquires the semicircular form , one and the same for all sites of the lattice . in this",
    "regime eigenstates are spread over all the lattice like in the gaussian ensemble .",
    "finally , we note that when the bethe lattice model is used to describe excitations in a quantum dot only the first ( lorentzian ) regime is relevant .",
    "indeed , in this case one is interested in the regime @xmath107 when the single - particle levels are resolved , whereas the energies @xmath55 of many - particle states included in the bethe lattice model are distributed in the interval of the order of @xmath15 , see eq.([e1d ] ) .",
    "the lorentzian form of the local spectral function holds , of course , also for higher energies , @xmath108 , where the discreteness of the spectrum is unimportant and the fermi golden rule is certainly applicable . to see this in our approach , one has to include in the model the states from a broader energy interval @xmath109 , as discussed in the end of sec.[s2 ] .",
    "however , we do not consider this region , where the single - particle states are not resolved and all the results ( say , for the lifetimes ) can be simply obtained in perturbation theory .",
    "in the preceding section , we have calculated the local spectral function @xmath43 at fixed value of the random potential @xmath68 in a given site @xmath37 but averaged over all the other random energies @xmath55 , @xmath110 .",
    "the main aim of the remaining part of the paper is to find out how a typical ( rather than averaged ) ldos looks like . for this purpose , we study fluctuations of @xmath43 in various regimes .",
    "it turns out that the parameter which distinguishes between the regimes ( at fixed value of the branching number @xmath0 @xcite ) is @xmath111 our consideration in this section will be similar to that of the preceding one .",
    "this will allow us to describe fluctuations of the ldos in the regime where they are weak , namely @xmath112 .    to study the fluctuations of the ldos , it is not sufficient to consider the integral equation ( [ e12 ] ) for the function @xmath113 determining the average ldos .",
    "instead a more complicated equation on a function @xmath114 of two variables has to be considered @xcite : @xmath115   \\label{e60}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us look again for its approximate solution in the gaussian form : @xmath116 substituting ( [ e61 ] ) in the r.h.s . of eq.([e60 ] ) , we get @xmath117 expanding this expression up to the terms of the order of @xmath118 and @xmath119 one finds that @xmath120 satisfies the same equation ( [ e16 ] ) obtained in sec.[s4 ] where the average ldos was considered .",
    "the function @xmath114 determines the fluctuations of the one - site green s function @xmath121 ( imaginary part of which is equal to @xmath122 ) via the following equation @xcite @xmath123 here @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the real and imaginary part of the inverse green s function , @xmath126^{-1}=\\tilde{u}-i\\tilde{v}\\ , \\label{e63a}\\ ] ] and @xmath127 is the joint probability distribution of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    substituting eq.([e61 ] ) into ( [ e63 ] ) , we find @xmath128 where ( neglecting the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath0 as in sec.[s3 ] ) @xmath129 we see that eqs.([e65 ] ) , ( [ e66 ] ) together with the definition ( [ e63a ] ) reproduce precisely the average ldos found in the preceding section .",
    "therefore , the gaussian approximation ( [ e61 ] ) corresponds to absence of any ldos fluctuations , as is clearly seen from eq.([e64 ] ) . to calculate corrections to the gaussian approximation we make the next iteration and expand eq.([e62 ] ) up to @xmath79 terms . assuming that we are in the lorentzian regime , @xmath130",
    ", we get after some algebra @xmath131 \\label{e67}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this in the l.h.s . of eq.([e63 ] ) and expanding both sides of this equation in a power series in @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we find the average values @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( as given by eqs.([e65 ] ) , ( [ e66 ] ) ) , and the variances @xmath136 the parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 determine the position and the width of the averaged ( lorentzian ) ldos whereas eq.([e68 ] ) describes its fluctuations .",
    "the relative strength of the fluctuations is characterized by the ratio @xmath139 thus , the ldos fluctuations are weak when @xmath112 . in the opposite case",
    "the fluctuations are strong and the gaussian ansatz is not a good approximation any longer .",
    "correspondingly , the expansion around it employed in this section breaks down .",
    "now we want to study a typical structure of ldos in the vicinity of the anderson transition point . for this purpose",
    ", we will need , however , information concerning the correlations in amplitudes of two different eigenfunctions with energies close to the mobility edge in the same spatial point .",
    "we will not use the fact that @xmath24 here and so our calculation will be valid for arbitrary branching number .",
    "moreover , we believe that the results of this section are of even more general validity and are not restricted to tree - like lattices ( see the discussion in the end of the section ) .",
    "the quantity we want to calculate here is the correlation function @xmath140 representing the overlap of the eigenfunctions , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the level correlation function , @xmath143 we are going to study it for energies @xmath45 , @xmath144 close to the mobility edge ( in the phase of delocalized states ) so that the correlation length @xmath145 is large .",
    "we will assume however that the system size is larger than the correlation length , so that the system is in the critical regime , but not exactly in the critical point .",
    "we will compare @xmath140 to the analogous correlation function containing a single eigenfunction , @xmath146 which defines the inverse participation ratio , @xmath147    in fact , the bethe lattice is not a proper model to study quantities like @xmath148 since these quantities are well - defined only for finite systems .",
    "however , a finite bethe lattice has a peculiar feature : most of its sites are located at the boundary . as the result",
    ", the properties may depend crucially on boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there exists , however , another model  that of sparse random matrices ( srm )  which describes a lattice having locally a tree - like structure similar to that of the bethe lattice but possessing also large - scale loops ensuring that all sites are essentially equivalent . as a consequence , this model is free from the problem of boundary conditions . at the same time",
    "it is known that the localization transition in the srm model is equivalent to that on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "the inverse participation ration ( [ e4a ] ) was studied in the delocalized phase of the srm model near the localization threshold in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown there that its critical behavior is determined by an exponentially large scale @xmath149 emerging in the non - compact sector of the effective supersymmetric model , @xmath150 the scale @xmath149 has a physical meaning of the `` correlation volume '' @xcite and determines also the critical behavior of conductivity in the delocalized phase .",
    "we extend now the calculation of ref.@xcite to find also the correlation function ( [ e3 ] ) .    to calculate the overlap function defined in eq.([e3 ] ) we follow @xcite and use the identity relating @xmath148 and @xmath140 to advanced and retarded green functions @xmath151 : @xmath152 \\label{4}\\\\ & & = \\mbox{re}\\left[\\langle g^r(r , e)g^a(r , e+\\omega )   -   g^r(r , e)g^r(r , e+\\omega)\\rangle \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us consider for definiteness the ensemble of real symmetric srm , corresponding to systems with unbroken time - reversal invariance .",

    "first of all , the general mechanism of the transition is the same in @xmath208 and @xmath209 models .",
    "furthermore , the sparsity ( multifractality ) of eigenstates near the transition point takes its extreme form for @xmath209 models @xcite , so that since the strong correlations ( [ 9a ] ) take place at @xmath209 it would be very surprising if they do not hold at finite @xmath207 as well .",
    "finally , eq.([9a ] ) was proven by an explicit calculation in the weak localization regime @xcite , where @xmath210 $ ] , with @xmath3 being the system volume and @xmath211 the diffusion propagator .",
    "therefore , we believe that also for a @xmath207-dimensional conductor the wd statistics applies everywhere in the delocalized phase , if the system is large enough . furthermore , this implies that exactly in the critical point the level repulsion has a conventional @xmath212 form on a scale @xmath213 .",
    "we refer the reader to a separate publication @xcite , where these questions are discussed in more detail .",
    "now we are prepared to study the structure of the ldos in the vicinity of the localization transition .",
    "we note first that the parameter @xmath214 defined by eq.([e30 ] ) is nothing else but the coupling constant of the corresponding @xmath21-model .",
    "in fact , to derive @xmath21-model rigorously one has to introduce @xmath23 states per lattice site @xcite , whereas the anderson model corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "however , the both models have essentially equivalent critical behavior , see below .",
    "the @xmath21-model is defined by the action ( we consider the unitary symmetry case for definiteness ) : @xmath215 where the summation in the first term goes over the pairs of nearest neighbor lattice sites , @xmath216 is a @xmath217 supermatrix belonging to certain coset space and satisfying the constraint @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 is the density of states , @xmath221 , and @xmath222 denotes the supertrace .",
    "the reader is referred to refs.@xcite for more detailed information on the supersymmetry formalism .    while considering the vicinity of the anderson transition point we prefer to work within the @xmath223model formalism .",
    "the @xmath21-model formulation has a considerable advantage : its behavior is determined by a single coupling constant @xmath214 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the original anderson model controlled by energy @xmath45 and the whole distribution function @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , the mechanism underlying the transition and all the essential features of the critical behavior are exactly the same for both the @xmath21-model and the anderson model on the bethe lattice , see refs.@xcite .",
    "when formulated on a bethe lattice the nonlinear @xmath21-model can be reduced to a certain non - linear integral equation for a function @xmath224 on the coset space defined as @xmath225 because of the invariance properties the function @xmath224 depends only on the two scalar variables ( eigenvalues ) @xmath226 and @xmath227 . moreover , in the localized phase ( as well as close to the transition point in the delocalized phase ) only the dependence on the `` non - compact '' variable @xmath228 is essential .",
    "in particular , in the localized phase the integral equation eq.([e32 ] ) in the limit @xmath229 takes the form @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath232 \\label{e34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the localized regime ( @xmath233 ) , eq.([e33 ] ) has a solution in the form of a kink with the asymptotics @xmath234 at @xmath235 and @xmath236 at @xmath237 .",
    "in contrast , in the delocalized phase ( @xmath233 ) , eq.([e33 ] ) has a trivial solution @xmath238 only .",
    "the anderson transition point @xmath239 is thus determined by a condition of the stability of the kink solution , which has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath240    for the nonlinear @xmath21-model with orthogonal symmetry ( corresponding to the case of unbroken time reversal invariance ) the underlying structure is completely analogous , except for a more complicated form of the function @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "however , all the gross properties and the results are essentially the same as in the unitary case .",
    "the technically simplest ( but still non - trivial ) `` toy '' variant of the supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath21-model was introduced by zirnbauer in @xcite and called `` hyperbolic superplane '' ( hsp ) . when formulated on the bethe lattice it has the critical behavior completely equivalent to that of the true nonlinear @xmath21-models of anderson localization @xcite . in particular , the `` invariant '' phase ( which should be associated with the localized states regime ) is described by the same integral equation ( [ e33 ] ) , with the kernel @xmath241 given by @xmath242    the kernel ( [ e37 ] ) has the same gross features as ( [ e34 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we are able to show that the position of the mobility edge in the anderson model on the large connectivity bethe lattice is exactly given by eqs.([e35 ] ) , ( [ e36 ] ) with the same kernel eq.([e37 ] ) .",
    "derivation of this result , and more generally , demonstration of the equivalence of the @xmath223model and the anderson model in the regime @xmath65 will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us stress , that this is exactly the region , where the transition for @xmath24 happens , see eq.([e39 ] ) below .    substituting eq.([e37 ] ) into eqs.([e35 ] ) , ( [ e36 ] ) , one gets the following equation for the transition point @xcite : @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the modified bessel function .",
    "using now @xmath245 and the small-@xmath246 behavior of @xmath247 , @xmath248 , we find @xmath249    let us first analyze the structure of the ldos @xmath43 in the phase of localized states , @xmath233 . in this regime , the spectrum is discrete , so that @xmath43 is given by a sum of @xmath8-functions with positions in @xmath250 and residues @xmath251 .",
    "only those eigenstates @xmath25 , which are localized close to the site @xmath37 , give appreciable contributions to this sum .",
    "the effective number of such states is measured by @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is the inverse participation ratio , @xmath254 rewriting @xmath253 in the second form ( more convenient for an analytical study ) , we used the fact that the states @xmath25 contributing appreciably to @xmath43 have energies @xmath255 close to @xmath68",
    ". the latter statement follows immediately from the results of sec.[s4 ] , where the average ldos was shown to be a narrow lorentzian around @xmath68 , see eq.([e19 ] ) .",
    "the ipr takes values between @xmath44 and @xmath177 corresponding to complete localization and delocalization of eigenfunctions respectively . in the localized phase",
    ", @xmath253 is finite , whereas in the delocalized one it is proportional to @xmath177 ( inverse system volume ) , and thus is equal to zero in the thermodynamic limit . in a @xmath207-dimensional conductor , when @xmath45 approaches the transition point from the phase of localized states , @xmath253 vanishes continuously : @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is one of the set of the exponents determining the multifractal structure of eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , on a bethe lattice this happens in an abrupt manner @xcite : @xmath253 has a finite limiting value @xmath11 as @xmath45 approaches @xmath19 from the side of localized states ( @xmath258 in terms of the @xmath21-model ) and then jumps discontinuously to zero in the extended phase ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "therefore , the effective number of @xmath8-peaks in @xmath43 in the localized phase stays finite as we approach the anderson transition point .",
    "this result was obtained in refs.@xcite , where the lattice connectivity was considered as a number of order of unity .",
    "let us study now what happens with the limiting value @xmath11 for large connectivity @xmath24 .",
    "the ipr is given by the following expression @xcite @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the solution of eq.([e33 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath24 the transition happens at @xmath262 , see eq.([e39 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the function @xmath241 , eq.([e37 ] ) , has in this regime a sharp maximum around @xmath263 with a width of the order of unity .",
    "taking into account the normalization property , @xmath264 , we have thus @xmath265 . substituting this in eq.([e33 ] ) , we find that the factor @xmath266 in the r.h.s . implies that the kink in the function @xmath261 is located at @xmath267 .",
    "we know from the analysis of refs.@xcite that the small-@xmath268 behavior of @xmath261 near the transition point is the following : @xmath269 where @xmath270 is a constant determining the position of the kink .",
    "we find thus @xmath271 , up to a factor of the order of unity .",
    "substituting this in eq.([e41 ] ) , we get @xmath272 \\ , \\label{e43}\\ ] ] so that @xmath273 therefore , at @xmath24 not only ipr has a non - zero limit at the transition point but this limiting value is close to unity , i.e. to the upper bound corresponding to extremely localized states concentrated on a single site . roughly speaking",
    ", the system undergoes a transition directly from the deeply localized phase ( @xmath10 close to unity ) to the extended phase ( @xmath274 ) .",
    "the above results , eqs.([e42])([e44 ] ) can be also reproduced by solving iteratively the self - consistency equation ( [ e33 ] ) .",
    "numerical results obtained in refs.@xcite show a clear tendency of increase of @xmath11 with @xmath0 , in full agreement with eq.([e44 ] ) .",
    "therefore , when the system approaches the anderson transition point from the localized side , the strength function @xmath43 has a form of the sum of @xmath8-like peaks with almost the whole of the spectral weight ( except a small fraction of the order of @xmath275 ) concentrated in one peak .",
    "when the system is driven through the critical point into the delocalized phase , this picture evolves gradually .",
    "namely , the peaks get broadened with a width depending on the distance to the critical point and vanishing ( in the thermodynamic limit ) at the critical point .",
    "it is clear that the width is given by the scale @xmath176 , within which the eigenfunctions are fully correlated ( see sec.[s3 ] ) .",
    "this scale is exponentially small in the vicinity of the critical point , see eq.([e4b ] ) , or in terms of the @xmath21-model coupling constant @xmath214 @xcite , @xmath276 such a critical behavior is a peculiar feature of the tree - like lattices , and is replaced by a conventional power - law critical behavior for a @xmath207-dimensional systems with @xmath208 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the critical vicinity of the transition point ( on the delocalized side ) , the peaks in @xmath43 have an exponentially small width of the order of @xmath277 , eq.([e45 ] ) .",
    "this is also confirmed by the behavior ( [ e4c ] ) of the ipr in this region .",
    "let us study now the behavior of the coefficient @xmath278 of the critical behavior ( [ e45 ] ) in the limit of large connectivity @xmath24 .",
    "this can be again the most easily done for the hsp model .",
    "the condition on the transition point is given by eq.([e39 ] ) , and the scale @xmath277 is given by @xcite @xmath279 where @xmath280 is determined from the equation @xmath281 expanding eq.([e48 ] ) in @xmath280 and @xmath282 and using the asymptotic behavior of the modified bessel function , @xmath283\\ , \\qquad \\alpha\\ll 1 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\gamma(i\\eta)={1\\over i\\eta}\\gamma(1+i\\eta)\\simeq{1\\over i\\eta}(1-i\\eta \\bbox{c})\\ , \\qquad \\eta\\ll 1 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath284 being the euler s constant ) , we reduce eq.([e48 ] ) to the following form : @xmath285(\\alpha-\\alpha_c ) \\label{e51}\\ ] ] using now the formula ( [ e39 ] ) for @xmath239 , we find @xmath286 so that according to eq.([e47 ] ) , @xmath287 therefore , the coefficient @xmath278 in eq.([e45 ] ) behaves as @xmath288 , with a factor @xmath289 of the order of unity . analyzing the derivation of eq.([e52 ] ) , we find that the critical behavior in the form ( [ e53 ] ) , ( [ e45 ] ) is valid for @xmath290 , where the fluctuations are exponentially strong . at @xmath291 the quantity @xmath277 as given by eq.([e45 ] ) is still large , @xmath292 , in view of @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath277 is not exponentially large anymore and ceases to be the leading factor determining the critical behavior of most of the relevant quantities , such as the ldos moments and the conductivity .",
    "for this reason , it turns out to be difficult to extend the above consideration onto the region @xmath293 .",
    "we know , however , from sec.[s4a ] that the region of relatively strong ldos fluctuations extends up to @xmath294 .",
    "let us now translate the obtainter results into the context of the problem of the one - particle excitations in a quantum dot .",
    "this can be straightforwardly done by using the relations ( [ e1b ] ) , ( [ e1c ] ) , ( [ e1d ] ) , and ( [ e30 ] ) between the parameters of the two problems .",
    "the localization transition then corresponds to the energy @xmath295 @xcite . in the localized region ( excitation energy @xmath45 below @xmath19 ) the bare states forming the basis of the fock space mix only weakly to each otner , so that the exact eigenstates are close to the bare ones .",
    "in particular , admixture of many - particles states to a single particle one is weak .",
    "therefore , only one exact eigenstate will contribute essentially to the spectral decomposition ( [ e2 ] ) of a single - particle state , see fig 1a .",
    "in the delocalized domain ( @xmath45 above @xmath19 ) exact eigenstates are superpositions of many bare ones .",
    "this is in full analogy with a delocalized state of the tight - binding model , which covers many ( infinitely many in the thermodynamic limit ) sites of the lattice . as a result",
    ", there are many exact eigenstates contributing to the strength function ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding envelope is of irregular ( strongly fluctuating ) shape in the intermediate ( critical ) regime @xmath296 , with @xmath297 , and acquires a breit - wigner form at @xmath298 .",
    "the width of this breit - wigner envelope ( spreading width of the one - particle state ) is given by eq.([e20 ] ) ( golden rule ) , yielding @xmath299 .",
    "finally , let us remind that what we considered throughout the paper was a tree - like model with a _ constant _ coordination number .",
    "in reality , however , the number of states to which a state of the @xmath22-th generation is coupled , decreases with increase of @xmath22 .",
    "let us briefly discuss how this is expected to modify the results .",
    "the transition will be now smeared into a crossover , since the transition point gets `` generation - dependent '' ( see also recent preprint @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the constant coordination number approximation all states on the energy shell ( i.e. with energies within the spreading width @xmath300 around @xmath45 ) get mixed at @xmath301 .",
    "in contrast , now only first few generation will get mixed under this condition ( that will be however sufficient to produce the breit - wigner envelope of the spectral function ( [ e2 ] ) ) .",
    "admixture of higher generations will require higher energies . to estimate ,",
    "when the complete mixing of the states on the energy shell happens , we note that the density of states of the generation @xmath22 is equal to @xmath302 which is a direct generalization of eq.([e1 ] ) . maximizing this expression",
    ", we find that a typical many - particle state belongs to a generation with @xmath303 , with typical energies of quasiparticles @xmath304 .",
    "the level spacing of the states to which this one is coupled is @xmath305 . comparing this to the typical value of the matrix element , @xmath306 , we conclude that the full mixing of the states on the energy shell ( ergodicity ) will be reached at @xmath307 , with @xmath308 . the same estimate for the `` chaotization border ''",
    "was obtained very recently by jacquod and shepelyansky @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied in detail the structure of the average and typical local density of states in a tight - binding model on a tree - like lattice with a large branching number @xmath24 . in the framework of",
    "the mapping recently suggested in ref.@xcite this local density of states describes the shape of the quasiparticle excitation line in a finite fermi system ( e.g. , quantum dot ) .",
    "we have exploited the supersymmetry approach to the problem developed previously , see refs.@xcite , and some of the results obtained in these papers .",
    "the results depend on the relation between two dimensionless parameters : the branching number @xmath0 and the coupling constant @xmath309 ( @xmath3 being the typical magnitude of the hopping matrix element in fock space and @xmath4 the width of the distribution of random site energies @xmath55 ) .",
    "the relation of these parameters to those of the original quantum dot model can be found in sec.[s2 ] . when @xmath310 the ldos in a given site @xmath38 averaged over the distribution of all random energies of other sites @xmath311 has a semicircular form . in the opposite case",
    "( relevant to the quantum dot model ) , @xmath312 , the _ averaged _ ldos has a lorentzian form with a width given by the golden rule , see eq.([e20 ] ) .",
    "however , the _ typical _ ldos is close to its average value only for @xmath313 . in the opposite case , @xmath314 ,",
    "the ldos fluctuations are strong , and the averaged ldos is not representative , see fig.1 .",
    "this is related to the existence of the anderson localization transition at the point @xmath315 .    on the insulating side of the transition , @xmath233 ,",
    "the ldos is given by a discrete sum of @xmath8-function peaks .",
    "the effective number of such peaks is characterized by @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the inverse participation ratio .",
    "it is known @xcite that on the bethe lattice the inverse participation ratio has a finite limiting value @xmath11 when the system approaches the transition point from the localized phase .",
    "we have shown that in the limit @xmath24 this limiting value is close to unity , @xmath316 , so that almost all the spectral weight ( [ e2 ] ) ( except a small part of the order of @xmath275 ) is concentrated in a single @xmath8-peak . roughly speaking",
    ", the system undergoes a transition directly from the deeply localized phase to the extended one .    when the system is driven through the critical point into the phase of extended states the peaks get broadened , with their width depending on the distance to the critical point and vanishing ( in the thermodynamic limit ) at the critical point .",
    "the width is determined by the scale @xmath176 such that for energy separations smaller than @xmath176 different eigenfunctions are fully correlated ( see sec.[s3 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the width is exponentially small in the vicinity of the critical point , see eqs.([e4b ] ) , ( [ e45 ] ) .",
    "this is also confirmed by the behavior ( [ e4c ] ) of the inverse participation ratio in this region .",
    "our results by and large confirm the picture presented by agkl @xcite .",
    "we have , however , quantified many features of the problem by using the supersymmetry approach and some of the results obtained earlier in the framework of this method .",
    "we disagree with agkl concerning their statement that in the delocalized phase the level correlation function of the tree - like model with fixed coordination number is not of the wigner - dyson form close to the transition point because exact eigenstates are very sparse and `` do not talk to each other''@xcite .",
    "we have shown in sec.[s3 ] that the eigenfunctions of the sparse random matrix model which are close in energy are strongly correlated in this regime .",
    "this explains the wigner - dyson form of the level correlation function proven in one of our earlier publications @xcite .    for the quantum dot problem",
    "the obtained results imply the fock - space delocalization of a single - particle excitation at excitation energies @xmath317 and formation of regular - shaped breit - wigner envelopes at @xmath318 .",
    "taking into account decrease of the coordination number in higher generations allows to estimate an energy , at which the complete ergodicity on the energy shell is restored as @xmath308 .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that an extensive study of statistical properties of eigenstates of a finite system of interacting fermions was undertaken recently by flambaum , izrailev , casati , and gribakin @xcite .",
    "in particular , these authors discuss crossover from the regime of strongly fluctuating local spectral density to that characterized by small fluctuations , which is similar to the questions addressed in the present paper @xcite .",
