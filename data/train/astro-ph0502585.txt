    "the peculiar galactic globular cluster ( ggc )  ( ngc5139 ) is currently subject to substantial observational efforts covering the whole wavelength spectrum . this gigantic star cluster ,",
    "the most massive known in our galaxy , has ( at least ) three separate stellar populations with a large undisputed spread in age , metallicity ( fe , ca ) and kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to recent abundance measurements based on 400 medium resolution spectra collected by @xcite , it seems that the spread in metallicity among the  stars is of the order of one dex ( @xmath3\\lesssim -1 $ ] ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution shows three well - defined peaks around @xmath4=-1.7 $ ] , @xmath5 and @xmath6 together with a few metal - rich stars at @xmath7 . on the basis of high - resolution spectra ,",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that stars in the anomalous branch @xcite might be more metal - rich , with a mean metallicity @xmath8\\sim-0.5 $ ] .",
    "a similar metal - rich tail was also detected by @xcite and by suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 , and references therein ) . in the absence of conformity in the literature for the  rgb names ,",
    "we here refer to the metal - poor component as , to the metal - intermediate as , and to the anomalous branch as .",
    "results from new observations seem to pose as many new questions as they answer .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the  population might be significantly younger than .",
    "however , in a recent investigation based on very large telescope ( vlt ) and hubble space telescope ( hst ) data , @xcite found that the  population is at least as old as the   population and probably a few gyrs older .",
    "the observational scenario was further complicated by the results brought forward by @xcite on the basis of multi - band hst data .",
    "they not only confirmed a bifurcation along the main sequence , but also found a series of different turn - offs ( tos ) and sub - giant branches ( sgbs ) .",
    "the proposed explanations in the literature for these peculiar stellar populations in  are many and include , e.g. , increased he content , or a separate group of stars located at a larger distance @xcite .",
    "the latter hypothesis could be further supported by the occurrence of a tidal tail in but we still lack a firm empirical detection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formation history and composition of  thus form a complex puzzle that is being slowly pieced together by investigations based on the latest generation of telescopes .",
    "a well - known promising technique is to study evolved stars simultaneously in optical and nir bands to limit subtle errors due to the absolute calibration , to crowding in the innermost regions , and to reddening corrections .",
    "the main aim of this letter is to investigate whether different assumptions concerning the spread in age and in chemical composition , or differences in distance and in reddening , account for observed optical ( @xmath9 ) and nir ( @xmath10 ) cmds .",
    "near - infrared @xmath11 images of  were collected in 2003 with sofi at the new technology telescope of eso , la silla .",
    "the seeing conditions were good and range from 06 to 11 .",
    "together with additional data from 2001 , available in the eso archive , we end up with a total nir sample of 92 @xmath12- and 135 @xmath13-band images that cover a @xmath14arcmin@xmath15 area centred on the cluster .",
    "these data were reduced with daophotii / allframe following the same technique adopted by @xcite .",
    "the nir catalogue includes @xmath16@xmath17 stars .",
    "with fors1 ( standard - resolution mode ) on the antu / vlt telescope , we also collected optical @xmath18 images in 1999 .",
    "these data are from a @xmath19 pointing mosaic centred on the cluster that covers an area slightly larger than @xmath20arcmin@xmath15 .",
    "exposure times range from 10 ( @xmath21 ) to 30 @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and seeing conditions were better than 10 .",
    "these data have also been reduced using daophotii / allframe and the photometric catalogue includes @xmath16@xmath24 stars .",
    "optical @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( hereinafter @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands ) data were retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "these images were collected with the acs instrument in 9 telescope pointings , each of which provides a @xmath29-image pair with exposure times of 12 ( @xmath27 ) and 8 @xmath22 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the field covered by these data is @xmath16@xmath30arcmin@xmath15 , centred on the cluster .",
    "the acs data were reduced with romafotwo and provide @xmath29 photometry for @xmath31 stars .",
    "the photometry was kept in the vega system ( see e.g. , http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents ) .",
    "a detailed description of observations and data reduction will be given in a future paper .",
    "here we only wish to mention that raw frames were prereduced using standard iraf procedures and , in addition , the fors1 images were corrected for amplifier cross - talk by following @xcite . to improve the photometric accuracy , carefully chosen selection criteria",
    "were applied to pinpoint a large number ( @xmath32100 ) of point - spread function stars across the individual frames , and several different reduction strategies were used to perform the photometry over the entire data set .",
    "the observed fields were combined to the same geometrical system using iraf.immatch and daomatch / daomaster .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration of ground - based instrumental magnitudes was performed using standard stars observed during the same nights .",
    "the typical accuracy is 0.02@xmath330.03@xmath33mag for both optical and nir data .",
    "figure 1 shows cmds based on the five different photometric bands .",
    "the plotted stars were selected from individual catalogues by using the ` separation index ' _ sep _ introduced by @xcite , since crowding errors dominate the photometric errors . the adopted _ sep _ ranges from 6.5 ( nir data ) to 8 ( acs data ) , which corresponds to stars having less than 0.3% of their measured light contaminated by neighbour stars ; the higher the _ sep _ for a star , the less the severity of the crowding by neighbours .",
    "error bars plotted at the left side of each panel account for photometric and calibration errors in magnitude and color .",
    "the input physics adopted in our evolutionary code has been discussed in detail in a series of papers @xcite . here , we point out that the stellar models ( partly available at http://astro.df.unipi.it/saa/pel/z0.html ) account for atomic diffusion , including the effects of gravitational settling , and thermal diffusion with diffusion coefficients given by @xcite . the amount of original he is based on a primordial he abundance @xmath34 and a he - to - metals enrichment ratio of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the solar mixture provided by @xcite . for details on the calibration of the mixing length parameter and on model validation",
    ", we refer to @xcite and @xcite . to avoid deceptive uncertainties in the comparison between theory and observations , the predictions were transformed into both the @xmath29 vega system and the @xmath36 johnson - cousins bands by adopting the atmosphere models provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "data plotted in fig .",
    "1 display the comparison between observations and a set of four isochrones ( solid lines ) with the same age ( 12 gyr ) and different chemical compositions ( see labels ) .",
    "a mean reddening of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xcite ) was adopted and a true distance modulus of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ; @xcite , @xmath41 , del principe et al .",
    "2004 , private communication ) .",
    "extinction parameters for both optical and nir bands have been estimated using the extinction model of @xcite .",
    "the metal - poor and the metal - intermediate isochrones supply , within current empirical and theoretical uncertainties , a good fit to the bulk of rgb and hb stars .",
    "close to the rgb tip , the isochrones are slightly brighter than the observed stars , which is caused by the adopted mixing - length parameter ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the sgb and the lower rgb are only marginally affected by this parameter , since the empirical isochrone calibration is based on these evolutionary phases @xcite",
    ". however , the most metal - rich isochrone appears to be systematically redder than the stars at the base of the  branch,@xmath28 plane by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2004 , see their fig .",
    "2 ) . ] ( green dots ) and fainter than the sgb stars . clearly , the shape of the   sgb does not support metal - abundances @xmath43 , since to stars for more metal - rich populations become brighter than sgb stars . to further constrain this evidence , fig .",
    "2 shows the comparison between observed hb stars ( the entire sample includes more than 2,300 objects ) and predicted zero age horizontal branches ( zahbs ) with a progenitor age of 12 gyr and different chemical compositions . for the sake of the comparison ,",
    "the objects located between hot hb stars and rgb stars were selected in the @xmath44 , @xmath27 plane and plotted as blue dots .",
    "theoretical predictions plotted in this figure show that the more metal - rich zahb appears to be systematically brighter than the observed hb stars for @xmath45 . moreover , the same zahb crosses the rgb region , thus suggesting that the occurrence of hb stars more metal - rich than z=0.002 should appear as an anomalous bump along the rgb .",
    "data plotted in these figures disclose that _ the stellar populations in  can not be explained with a ranking in metal abundance_. in line with @xcite and @xcite , we find that plausible changes in the cluster distance , reddening , age , and chemical composition do not supply a reasonable simultaneous fit of the , , and  branches .",
    "to further investigate the nature of the  branch , we performed a series of tests by changing the metallicity , the cluster age , and the distance .",
    "a good fit to the anomalous branch is possible by adopting the same reddening as in fig.[fig : apjfig1 ] , a true distance modulus of @xmath46 , and an isochrone of 15.5 gyr with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "figure[fig : apjfig3 ] shows that these assumptions supply a good fit in both the optical and the nir bands , and indeed the current isochrone properly fits the width in color of the sub - giant branch and the shape of a good fraction of the rgb .",
    "moreover , the zahb for the same chemical composition ( dashed line ) agrees quite well with the faint component of hb stars .",
    "note that more metal - poor zahbs at the canonical distance do not supply a reasonable fit of the yellow spur stars with @xmath49 .",
    "the yellow spur is visible in all planes , and in the nir ( * c*,*d * ) it even splits up in brightness due to a stronger sensitivity to effective temperature .",
    "the identification of the entire sample was checked on individual images and , once confirmed by independent measurements , the data indicate a separate hb sequence for the  population .",
    "although the  fit may appear good , it implies an increase in distance of @xmath50 and an unreasonable @xmath51 gyr increase in age .",
    "this estimate is at variance with the absolute age estimates of ggcs @xcite and with cmb measurements by w - map @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy becomes even larger if we account for the fact that this isochrone was constructed by adopting a he abundance slightly higher ( @xmath48 , vs 0.238 ) than estimated from a he - to - metals enrichment ratio @xmath52 .",
    "this increase implies a decrease in age of @xmath16 1 gyr .",
    "moreover , we are performing a differential age estimate , and therefore if we account for uncertainties : in the input physics of the evolutionary models ( e.g. equation of state , opacity ) ; in the efficiency of macroscopic mechanisms ( like diffusion ) ; in model atmospheres applied in the transformation of the models into the observational plane ; and in the extinction models , we end up with an uncertainty of @xmath53 gyr in cluster age @xcite .    owing to the wide range of chemical compositions and stellar ages adopted in the literature for explaining the morphology of the  branch",
    ", we decided to investigate whether different combinations of assumed values of distance , chemical composition , and reddening may also simultaneously account for the   branch and the hb stars .",
    "we found that two isochrones of 13 gyr for @xmath54 and @xmath55 bracket the  stars ( see fig.4 ) , within empirical and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the fit was obtained using the same true distance modulus adopted in fig.[fig : apjfig3 ] , together with a mild increase in reddening , @xmath2 .",
    "once again theory agrees reasonably well with observations in all color planes .",
    "moreover , data plotted in fig . 5 show that the predicted zahb with z=0.0015 and z=0.003 , for the adopted distance modulus and reddening correction , account for the yellow spur stars .",
    "the same figure shows a sample of 53 rr lyrae stars selected from the variable - star catalogue by @xcite for which we have a good coverage of @xmath12- and @xmath56-band light curves ( del principe et al .",
    "2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the rr lyrae stars only account for a tiny fraction of the yellow - spur stars .",
    "this finding together with the detection a well - defined sequence in panels * b*,*c * , and * d * indicate that this spur might be the hb associated with the  population .",
    "note that a few of these ` -hb ' spur stars have also been detected by rey et al .",
    "( 2004 , see their fig .",
    "7 , for @xmath57 ) and by sollima et al .",
    "( 2004a , see their figs .",
    "6 and 12 ) .",
    "we have presented a new set of multi - band photometric data for the ggc  and  in agreement with previous findings in the literature  we find no acceptable fit to the different stellar populations for a single distance , reddening , and age .",
    "we found two reasonable fits for the  stars : ( 1 ) by adopting a 0.2 higher distance modulus ( @xmath58 500 pc ) , a metal - intermediate composition ( @xmath47 , @xmath59 ) , and an unreasonable increase in age of @xmath164 gyr ; or ( 2 ) for the same @xmath60 shift , an increase in the reddening , metal - intermediate chemical compositions ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , and an age that , within current uncertainties , is coeval with the bulk of the  stars .",
    "current findings indicate that  stars are not significantly more metal - rich than @xmath55 .",
    "this evidence is supported by the shape of the  sgb , as already suggested by @xcite and by the fit of hb stars .",
    "we are in favour of the latter solution for the following reasons :    @xmath63 the difference in distance between the  branch and the bulk of   stars is of the order of 10% .",
    "this estimate is 34 times smaller than the estimate by @xcite and in very good agreement with the distance of the density maxima detected by @xcite along the tidal tails of the ggc pal  5 .",
    "moreover , recent n - body simulations ( capuzzo dolcetta et al .",
    "2004 ) indicate that clumps along the tidal tails can approximately include 10% of the cluster mass .",
    "@xmath63 we found that by artificially shifting the -branch stars to account for the assumed difference in distance and reddening , they overlap with the  population .",
    "it has been recently suggested by piotto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , on the basis of low - resolution spectra , that the bluer main sequence detected by bedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is more metal - rich than the red main sequence .",
    "unfortunately , current acs photometry is only based on shallow acs exposures , and therefore we can not properly identify in our data these stellar populations located in the lower main sequence .",
    "the same outcome applies to the suspected extremely - hot hb progeny of the bluer main sequence , since they have not been detected in the nir bands .",
    "@xmath63 current preliminary findings support recent n - body simulations by chiba & mizutani ( 2004 ) and by ideta & makino ( 2004 ) .",
    "in particular , the latter authors found , by assuming that the progenitor of omega centauri is a dwarf galaxy , that more than 90% of its stellar content was lost during the first few pericenter passages ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) .    @xmath63  reddening estimates in the literature cluster around @xmath64 .",
    "however , the map from @xcite indicates reddening variations of 0.02 across the body of the cluster while , more importantly , 2mass data @xcite show a very clumpy reddening distribution at distances beyond 1@xmath65 ( 100@xmath33pc ) from the cluster centre , with large variations @xmath66 across a 4degrees@xmath15 area .",
    "however , the inference of reddening _ between _ the main body of  and the supposed background population is very surprising .  lies at the comparatively low galactic latitude of @xmath67 , and the reddening variations seen in the schlegel and 2mass maps likely originate in the foreground interstellar material of the galactic disk .",
    "any interstellar material behind  must lie at least 1.4@xmath33kpc from the galactic plane , and therefore would most likely be associated with  itself .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have reported a significant detection of @xmath68 in the direction of , blueshifted by @xmath69 km s@xmath70 with respect to the cluster velocity .",
    "however , their interpretation is that this gas is associated with the northern extension of the magellanic stream far beyond the cluster .",
    "it would be a remarkable coincidence if this interstellar material happened to lie between the cluster and a clump in the tidal tail at a 10% greater distance than the main cluster body , while traveling at the quoted relative speed .",
    "however , it is worth noting that smith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) estimated for this cloud a column density of @xmath71 atmos / cm@xmath15 , and therefore a reddening @xmath73 ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) that is at least a factor of two larger than required by our best fits .",
    "this point is crucial for the proposed explanation and needs to be further investigated .",
    "finally , we note that the comparison between predicted zahbs and hb stars indicates that the occurrence of an old stellar population with @xmath74 would imply the occurrence of an anomalous clump along the rgb .",
    "in fact , more metal - rich , red hb stars cover the same color range of metal - poor rgb stars .",
    "the detection of such a feature along the rgb can supply robust constraints on the progeny of the  stellar population .",
    "these results , when independently confirmed , would suggest that the  branch might be a clump of stars located 500 pc beyond the bulk of the cluster . no firm conclusion can be drawn on the basis of current data , although this evidence together with the increase in radial velocity among  stars measured by @xcite and numerical simulations recently provided by capuzzo dolcetta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indicates that it could be a tidal tail .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank m. sirianni and n. panagia for fundamental suggestions on the calibration of acs data .",
    "we wish to tank two anonymous referees for their suggestions and pertinent comments that helped us to improve the content and the readability of the manuscript .",
