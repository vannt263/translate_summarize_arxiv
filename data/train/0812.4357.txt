    "early investigations , initiated by salem and longuet - higgins , @xcite focused on the ground state of polyacene  whether and how the peierls distortion occurs .",

    "every structure was actually nominated for the most stable in the literature .",
    "@xcite the controversy suggests that all these structures should closely compete with each other .",
    "first of all the _ cis- _ and _ trans-_distorted isomers of infinite polyacene have exactly the same energy within an electron - phonon model without any coulomb interaction @xcite such as the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian for polyacetylene .",
    "@xcite they remain degenerate with each other unless we take account of coulomb interactions beyond the hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme . secondly the peierls instability in polyacene is conditional for both _",
    "cis _ and _ trans _ forms , @xcite where the electron - phonon coupling strength seriously affects the scenario .",
    "thirdly electron correlations make the situation more difficult .",
    "@xcite they enhance the peierls instability on one hand , while they push the mott - hubbard antiferromagnetic insulator on the other hand , against the uniform aromatic configuration .    in such circumstances , ramasesha and coworkers",
    "@xcite applied modern numerical tools to polyacene modeled on correlated hamiltonians of the hubbard and pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) types , which include the on - site repulsion alone and the power - law - decaying long - ranged interaction whole , respectively , but both take no account of spontaneous phonons .",
    "they claim that the _ cis _ distortion is lower in energy than the _ trans _ one , both of which may , however , be replaced by a spin density wave ( sdw ) on the uniform lattice with increasing coulomb interactions .",
    "while other authors @xcite predict a fully delocalized nonalternating nature of polyacene employing standard and developed density - functional methods , the energy difference among such competing states must be rather small @xcite in any case .",
    "then distorted and undistorted regions may coexist in actual polyacene compounds due to inevitable local defects and/or possible thermal excitations .",
    "we are now led to take an interest in characterizing these likely states rather than ranking them . even if there is a slight energy difference between the _ cis- _ and _ trans-_distorted structures , how can we tell the lower from the higher in practice ?",
    "we suggest the polarized optical spectroscopy for polyacene in answer to this question .",
    "it deserves special mention in the context of our interest that sony and shukla @xcite have recently calculated the optical absorption spectra of oligoacenes on a large scale within correlated hamiltonians of the ppp type .",
    "starting from the restricted hf state , which is an undistorted paramagnetic metal , they investigate in detail configuration interactions ( cis ) between its particle - hole excitations of various levels ",
    "single , double , and more . in order to describe the effects of electron correlations on the optical properties of aromatic molecules as precisely as possible ,",
    "their argument is restricted to small oligomers up to seven benzene rings and any possibility of lattice distortion is ruled out .",
    "other groups of theoreticians @xcite investigate an infinite acene chain within uncorrelated models of the ssh type in an attempt to find nonlinear excitations such as solitons and polarons , where any scenario is constructed on a peierls - distorted structure without any concern for its configuration_cis _ or _",
    "trans_because of the degenerate energetics .",
    "thus and thus , there is , to our knowledge , no guiding calculation of the optical properties of polyacene under both electron - electron and electron - lattice interactions adequately existent .",
    "we aim at revealing the generic behavior of polyacene rather than listing individual features of small oligoacenes . in order to simulate an infinite chain efficiently ,",
    "we adopt the periodic boundary condition and restrict coulomb interactions to a certain range .",
    "@xcite investigated the ground - state properties of polyacene applying a projector monte carlo method to the hubbard hamiltonian with periodic boundaries , while raghu _",
    "_ @xcite carried out similar calculations applying a density - matrix renormalization - group method to the ppp hamiltonian with open boundaries .",
    "they declare that the long - range nature of electron - electron interactions does not qualitatively affect their essential findings such as the conditional peierls instability and the _ cis _ distortion favored over the _ trans _ one .",

    "they are very much likely to coexist in polyacene .",
    "@xcite then , how can we distinguish between the two distorted structures ?",
    "we calculate the polarized optical conductivity spectra of energetically competing ip bow , op bow , and af with varying number of contributive slater determinants and compare them in fig .",
    "[ f : scoc ] .",
    "first of all we are impressed with an optical contrast between ip bow and op bow , which is noticeable even in the hf scheme . they are degenerate with each other in their energetics but distinguishable from each other in their optics .",
    "their most intense peaks appear far apart and in between is that of af .",
    "the hf description of the relative intensity and position of each peak is much poorer than the ci findings , but it is useful enough to illuminate the optical nature of individual phases in a qualitative manner .    based on the hf energy scheme , fig .",
    "[ f : scocdtl ] analyzes the polarized optical conductivity spectra parallel and perpendicular to the conjugation direction .",
    "there are four molecular orbitals in each unit cell and they are molded into two valence and two conduction bands fulfilling the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the dispersion relations of ip bow and op bow are exactly the same within the hf scheme and remain alike even with many - body coulomb correlations fully considered .",
    "@xcite their dipole transition matrices are also the same provided the excitation light is polarized in the rung direction , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : scocdtl](c ) , where most of the spectral weight comes from @xmath51-to-@xmath52 interband transitions .",
    "it is due to the parity - definite molecular orbitals @xcite that both @xmath53-to-@xmath52 and @xmath51-to-@xmath54 interband excitations make no contribution to the rung - direction optical conductivity . under the reflection about the plane bisecting every rung bond , the valence and conduction bands labeled @xmath53 and @xmath52 are of symmetric character , whereas those labeled @xmath51 and @xmath54 are of antisymmetric character , in both ip bow and op bow .",
    "any transition with parity unchanged is optically forbidden . on the other hand , photoirradiation in the conjugation direction",
    "reveals a striking contrast between ip bow and op bow , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : scocdtl](b ) , where all the spectral weight comes from @xmath53-to-@xmath52 and @xmath51-to-@xmath54 interband transitions in ip bow , while little contribution from them in op bow .",
    "the conjugation - direction optical conductivity on an op - bow background arises mostly from @xmath51-to-@xmath52 and @xmath53-to-@xmath54 excitations .",
    "the @xmath55 spectra of ip bow and op bow are thus distinguishable .",
    "their main peaks sandwich the af low - energy absorption bands ( fig .",
    "[ f : scoc ] ) . with coulomb correlations fully taken into account ,",
    "the most intense absorption band is sharpened and grown up in general .",
    "those of op bow and af are close to each other , staying away from that of ip bow .",
    "the screened - coulomb and moderate - coupling parameters in our use stabilize af slightly more than ip bow .",
    "band gaps are barometers of stabilization and therefore af is gapped wider than ip bow [ fig .",
    "[ f : scocdtl](a ) ] .",
    "although the bow peierls gap is smaller than the af mott - hubbard gap , the main absorption peak in the af spectrum appears much below that in the ip - bow one .",
    "this trick is due to the optically forbidden lowest - lying peierls - gap excitation through a long - axis - polarized photon on an ip - bow background .",
    "the optical contrast between ip bow and op bow is more and more accentuated with increasing coupling strength .",
    "if we reduce the elastic constant @xmath24 to half the present value , as is indicated with @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ f : phd ] , the electron - lattice coupling is effectively strengthened and any distorted structure is sufficiently stabilized against the mott insulator",
    ". it may be the case , for instance , with organic molecular compounds of alternating tetrathiafulvalene and chloranil @xcite and/or halogen - bridged transition - metal linear - chain complexes .",
    "@xcite figure [ f : skscocdtl ] shows the same calculations as in fig .",
    "[ f : scocdtl ] but @xmath56 . in the case of electron - lattice interactions predominating over electron - electron correlations , both valence and conduction bands are much less dispersive in general and the long - axis - polarized dipole transitions between them are really eloquent of their background lattice distortion . in the conjugation direction ,",
    "@xmath53-to-@xmath54 and @xmath51-to-@xmath52 dipole matrix elements vanish on an ip - bow background , while those of @xmath53-to-@xmath52 and @xmath51-to-@xmath54 are negligibly small on an op - bow background . for light polarized in the rung direction , ip bow and op bow similarly behave and their optical features are essentially given by @xmath51-to-@xmath52 interband transitions .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ f : skscoc ] the resultant polarized optical conductivity spectra . for light polarized in the conjugation direction , ip bow and op bow exhibit a single and two well - separate absorption bands , respectively . with configuration interactions fully taken into account ,",
    "the single ip - bow absorption band consists of an intense peak and its satellite in the high - energy side , whereas a couple of the op - bow absorption bands are both single - peaked , in a practical sense , due to the predominant zone - center excitations .",
    "many - body electron correlations further have a significant effect on the relative intensity of the absorption bands .",
    "the spectral weight of the higher - energy op - bow absorption band turns out much smaller than that of the lower - energy one . for light polarized in the rung direction , ip bow and op bow are degenerate with each other .",
    "their spectra slightly differ beyond the hf scheme , but the difference is hardly recognizable in practice .",
    "the common @xmath57 spectrum is peaked similarly to the ip - bow @xmath55 spectrum , but high - energy absorptions are strongly suppressed in the rung direction .",
    "finally we stress that the present findings are not individual features of small oligoacenes but symbolize polyacene in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "all the features but irregular outlines peculiar to small clusters in fig .",
    "[ f : skscoc ] remain unchanged with further increasing conjugation length , as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : skscoclrg ] .",
    "indeed the absolute location and the relative intensity of every absorption depend on the number of benzene rings , @xcite but they are almost converging at @xmath48 .",
    "we have optically characterized competing ground states of polyacene and revealed a striking contrast between the two highly - degenerate peierls - distorted states in particular .",
    "the _ cis- _ and _ trans-_distorted structures , which we refer to as ip bow and op bow , are almost degenerate in their energetics but quite distinct in their optics .",
    "the highest - occupied - molecular - orbital ( homo)-to - lowest - unoccupied - molecular - orbital ( lumo ) transition through a long - axis - polarized photon is allowed in op bow but forbidden in ip bow .",
    "there appear two well - separate absorption bands against a background of op bow and in between does a single absorption band with an ip - bow background sit .",
    "such distinct features may not be demonstrated as they are in polyacene of predominantly strong electron - electron correlation , but with growing electron - lattice coupling they become detectable literally .",
    "we may consider heteroacenes such as paracyanogen , @xcite as well as substituting hydrogen atoms in polyacene with larger molecules , in an attempt to tune the elastic properties and to realize a coupling - dominant situation .",
    "the realistic set of parameters is located in close vicinity to a phase boundary , where an antiferromagnetic mott - insulating state , which we refer to as af , is slightly lower in energy and gapped wider than the two peierls - distorted states .",
    "the most intense af absorption peak nevertheless appears far below the ip - bow absorption band for light polarized in the conjugation direction . for light polarized in the rung direction , on the other hand ,",
    "the common optical gap of ip bow and op bow is naively smaller than that of af .",
    "the relative location of their main absorption peaks remains qualitatively unchanged with varying configuration interactions , though the excitonic effects on the optical spectra are significant in general .",

    "are so degenerate with each other that much effort has been devoted to solving the problem of which is energetically preferable .",
    "@xcite then the optical contrast between them will indeed come in useful for identifying them .",
    "regular substitution of carbon atoms in polyacene , for instance , with nitrogen atoms , may lead to further stabilization of the peierls - distorted structures against the aromatic one .",
