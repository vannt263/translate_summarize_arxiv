    "in the first part of this article we summarise the status and latest measurements of b - hadron lifetimes and lifetime ratios , including some recent result from the tevatron and the b factories , and compare those results with the predictions from heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) . future prospects for lifetime measurements at the b factories and the tevatron are discussed .    in the second part",
    ", we review the status and prospects of measuring the difference between the lifetimes of the two cp eigenstates in the @xmath0-@xmath1  system .",
    "life time measurements in the heavy quark sector gain specific significance due to the precise predictions of heavy quark expansion ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ) thus providing a testing ground for this theoretical tool that is frequently used , for example to relate experimental measurements to ckm parameters like @xmath2 to @xmath3 or @xmath4 to @xmath5 .    the hierachy expected for b hadron lifetimes is  @xcite : @xmath6 + recent hqe predictions for the lifetime ratios are  @xcite :    * @xmath7 * @xmath8 * @xmath9      the b factories babar  and belle  at the asymmetric @xmath10 colliders pep - ii and kek have collected @xmath11 and @xmath12 worth of data respectively up to may 2003 , running at the @xmath13 resonance .",

    "the cm frame is boosted ( @xmath20 for babar  and @xmath21 for belle ) such that the @xmath14  and @xmath15  travel a measurable distance in the detector before decaying .    because the b mesons decay virtually at rest in the @xmath13 frame , their momenta in the lab frame are known from the beam momentum .",
    "this constrains the decay dynamics considerably with the important consequence that the decay vertex of a b meson can be obtained from a single decay product , by intersecting its track with the beam axis .",
    "the decay distance along the beamline ( @xmath22 ) is directly proportional to the proper decay time for a given beam momentum ( small corrections apply  @xcite ) . lacking primary vertex information , it is the distance between the decay vertices of the two b mesons that is used for measuring the life time .",

    "this modeling of the resolution function , together with the modeling of the background distribution , is the biggest systematic uncertainty in both experiments .",
