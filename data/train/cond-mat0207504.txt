    "as the early universe cooled it is believed to have undergone a series of spontaneous phase transitions , whose inhomogeneities ( monopoles , cosmic strings , domain walls ) have observable consequences , for structure formation in particular .",
    "these defects appear because the correlation length @xmath3 of the field ( or fields ) whose expectation value is the order parameter is necessarily _ finite _ for a transition that is implemented in a finite time , whether it be continuous or not .",
    "it is difficult to determine the microscopic dynamics of such fields but , using only simple causal arguments kibble@xcite made estimates of this early field ordering , and the density of topological defects produced at grand unified theory ( gut ) transitions at @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , because the nature of the field theories is not known with any reliability , and the effects of their evolution are not visible until the decoupling of the radiation and matter @xmath5 later , it is impossible to provide unambiguous checks of these predictions .",
    "however , causality is such a fundamental notion that zurek suggested@xcite that identical causal arguments , with similar predictions , were applicable to condensed matter systems for which direct experiments on defects could be performed .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic interest for a better understanding of the dynamics of transitions in condensed matter , the hope is that successful tests of these predictions can lead to a better understanding of phase transitions in quantum fields .",
    "several experiments in condensed matter systems have already been performed@xcite to test the zurek - kibble predictions , with mixed results .",
    "it is these predictions that we have tested here , using annular josephson tunnel junctions , for which the defects are _",
    "fluxons_.    this paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the zurek - kibble ( zk ) scenario .",
    "successive sections then give the predictions for annular josephson tunnel junctions ( ajtjs ) , show how the fluxons are measured , the nature of the samples , describe the experimental setup and , finally , present the measurements and their agreement with the predictions .",
    "an abbreviated description of the experiment has been given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "details of the theoretical analysis can be found in @xcite , in which an earlier experiment@xcite by two of us ( r.m and j.m ) was analysed , to demonstrate its compatibility with the zk analysis , even though it had not been performed with this in mind .",
    "consider a system with critical temperature @xmath6 , cooled through that temperature so that , if @xmath7 is the temperature at time @xmath8 , then @xmath9 . @xmath10 defines the quench time @xmath11 .",
    "there are several ways@xcite of formulating the zurek - kibble causality bounds , but they all depend on the fact that , as the transition begins to be implemented , there is a maximum speed @xmath12 at which the system can become ordered . for relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) @xmath13 is the speed of light . for superfluids , @xmath14 is the speed of second sound , vanishing at @xmath15 . for josephson tunnel junctions @xmath14 , which depends on the nature of the junction , is the swihart@xcite velocity .",
    "suppose that the equilibrium ( adiabatic ) correlation length @xmath16 diverges near @xmath15 as @xmath17 however , the true non - equilibrium correlation length @xmath18 can only change so much in a finite time , and does not diverge .",
    "kibble and zurek made two assumptions :    * firstly , the correlation length @xmath19 of the fields that characterizes the onset of order is the equilibrium correlation length @xmath20 at some appropriate time @xmath21 . * secondly , we can measure @xmath19 experimentally by measuring the number of defects , assuming that the defect separation @xmath22 .",
    "there are several ways to estimate @xmath23 ( the causal time ) , explicit or implicit in the early work of zurek@xcite .",
    "most simply ,    * @xmath18 can not grow faster than @xmath14 .",
    "this is true both before and after the transition .",
    "that is , @xmath24 is defined by the condition that @xmath25 . *",
    "the relaxation time for the long wavelength modes @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 . from this viewpoint @xmath21",
    "is that time when we can return to an adiabatic regime , @xmath28 .    in simple systems",
    "these estimates agree , up to numerical factors approximately unity@xcite .",
    "they give @xmath21 of the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cold relaxation time of the longest wavelength modes , and the critical exponent @xmath31 depends upon the system . as a result , @xmath32 . identifying the initial domain size and defect separation as in the second zk assumption then gives @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "this is very large on the scale of cold defects which shrink to size @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the final temperature , and @xmath37 is determined from the microscopic dynamics .",
    "we term @xmath0 the zurek - kibble ( zk ) scaling index .",
    "the analysis above is for large systems , of linear size @xmath38 . for the experiment that we shall describe below , of annular josephson tunnel junctions ( ajtjs ) of circumference @xmath39",
    ", we find that is @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , we expect the conclusions to be equally valid for small systems , for which the relevant time might , incorrectly , seem to be the time when the coherence length becomes smaller than the system .",
    "the reason is that the causal bounds ( [ xibar ] ) are to be thought of as a short - hand for the underlying dynamics . at the microscopic level",
    ", causality along the lines above is not explicit , although encoded in the relevant dynamical equations .",
    "the picture is rather one of order being established through the growth of the amplitudes of long - wavelength instabilities .",
    "the earliest time at which we can identify defects from this viewpoint is when the order parameters have achieved their equilibrium magnitudes .",
    "qualitatively , for simple models this time is in good agreement with the causal time @xmath23 above .",
    "there is no real surprise in this .",
    "it has been shown by one of us@xcite that , in general , the causal time and distance scales @xmath23 and @xmath41 are just as we would expect from dimensional analysis ( in the mean - field approximation ) and unstable modes grow exponentially , whereby the dependence of the causal time ( and corresponding defect density ) on the microscopic parameters is only logarithmic . in the same way , the distance between field zeroes has the same scaling dependence on @xmath42 as @xmath43 of ( [ xibar ] ) , up to logarithms .    as for the production of defects",
    ", they are transitional regions between different system ground - states . for superfluids like @xmath44 and superconductors",
    "these transitional regions are flagged by _",
    "zeroes _ of the scalar order - parameter field . for the case of jtjs we shall see that this is generalised to _ zeroes ( mod @xmath45 ) _ of the order - parameter field .",
    "any field crossing zero ( mod @xmath45 ) has the potential to mature into a defect .",
    "however , only when the transition is complete will the field configurations in the vicinity of the zeroes have the energy profile of a classical defect , the solution to the classical field equations .",
    "thus , before the causal time we now have a picture in which there is a fractal thermal fuzz of potential defects , whose density depends on the scale at which we look . by the causal time",
    "some of these have developed into the ( scale - independent ) defects that we see subsequently ( see @xcite ) . because , from this viewpoint , we have many proto - defects jockeying to become the real thing , the relevant scale to compare to the system size is not @xmath46 but @xmath47 , as before .",
    "equivalently , counting field zeroes ( mod @xmath48 , or not ) depends on the short - distance behaviour of the field correlations .",
    "we do not expect a problem as long as @xmath49 , as is always the case .",
    "we conclude by noting that this is a very different picture from that of domains freezing in as the transition is approached from _ above _ ( @xmath50 ) , which is how causal bounds were originally posed@xcite . what matters is that all these causal descriptions give results with the correct engineering dimensions . with this in mind",
    ", we keep the causal bound ( [ xibar ] ) as a convenient mnemonic .",
    "the order parameter of a josephson tunnel junction at temperature @xmath51 is the phase difference @xmath52 of the macroscopic superconducting quantum mechanical wave functions across the barrier . using a lagrangian formalism grnbech - jensen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that , for an annular jtj with a distributed bias current @xmath31 , @xmath52 obeys to the following perturbed sine - gordon equation ( psge ) : @xmath53 provided the width @xmath54 of the annulus , of radius @xmath55 , satisfies @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the josephson coherence length . in this case @xmath58",
    "measures the distance along the annulus , and @xmath59 is the swihart velocity . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the coefficients of the losses due to the tunnelling current and to the surface impedance , respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions for eq.([sg ] ) are periodic @xcite and derive from fluxoid quantization @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the circumference of the junction and the winding number @xmath64 is an integer corresponding to the algebraic sum of fluxons trapped in the junction barrier at the normal - superconducting ( n - s ) transition ; @xmath64 is a topological system constant , that is , only fluxon - antifluxon ( @xmath65 ) pairs can be created or annihilated as long as the junction remains in the superconducting state .",
    "the classical fluxons are the kinks of the sine - gordon theory . as with other models of defect formation , equation ( [ sg ] )",
    "is only valid once the transition is complete : therefore , we shall not use it to study the appearance of fluxons .",
    "however , it is sufficient to enable us , in the spirit of the zurek - kibble scenario , to identify @xmath66 , diverging at @xmath67 , as the equilibrium correlation length @xmath68 to be constrained by causality .",
    "further , the swihart velocity @xmath59 ( with critical slowing down at @xmath69 ) , measures the maximum speed at which the order parameter can change@xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the zk bounds has been given elsewhere by us@xcite , and we refer the reader to these articles for more details .",
    "the jtjs in our experiment are _ symmetric _",
    ", by which is meant that the electrodes are made of identical superconducting material with the same energy gaps and the same @xmath6 . for such jtjs @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , at the time of their formation @xmath71 the separation of fluxons is expected , in the zk picture , to be @xmath72 where @xmath37 and @xmath73 have the same meaning as before .",
    "it is the prediction ( [ jtj ] ) that will be tested in our experiment .    in terms of the parameters of the jtjs ,",
    "@xmath37 has been inferred@xcite as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the josephson current density at temperature @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is given in terms of the superconductor gap energy and critical temperature and has a value between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if the thickness of the two superconducting electrodes differs , the effective thickness @xmath80 is the harmonic mean of the individual thicknesses@xcite . as for @xmath73 , it is given as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 defines the behavior @xmath83of the swihart velocity for the system near @xmath69 .",
    "once fluxons have appeared eq.[sg ] is relevant .",
    "a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions in ajtjs is that fluxons behave as relativistic particles on an infinite lossy line . in the absence of any current through the barrier and/or",
    "externally applied magnetic field the fluxons experience a flat potential and therefore are in indifferent equilibrium as far as the barrier is homogeneous and pin - hole free ; in the reality , the barrier defects act as small pinning or repulsive potentials for the fluxons . due to the losses , after the transient regime is over the fluxons",
    "are still .",
    "unfortunately static fluxons are difficult to reveal , since according to the second josephson law , any static phase profile @xmath84 does not alter the junction zero - voltage state that is also typical of a flat profile @xmath85 , corresponding to the absence of any trapped fluxon .",
    "in contrast , whenever fluxons travel around an ajtj they leave a clear signature on the junction current - voltage characteristic ( ivc ) and therefore are easily detectable .",
    "in fact , as soon as a bias current is fed to the ajtj , the fluxons move as magnetic dipoles under the action of the resulting lorentz force .",
    "the fluxon dynamics in long jtjs is a well known topic and has received a great deal of both theoretical and experimental attention in the last few decades . if the external bias is assumed to be uniform over the junction area , then , as a result of the balance between the externally supplied power and the internally dissipated power , the fluxons move with a constant speed : the larger is the external bias the greater is the fluxon speed , but never exceeding its relativistic limit sets by the swihart velocity .",
    "the motion direction depends both on the current sign and fluxon polarity ( i.e. , whether @xmath86 ) for a given bias current .",
    "fluxons having different polarities travel in opposite directions and are likely to annihilate when they collide at low speed .",
    "quantitatively , if a fluxon travels around an ajtj having a mean circumference @xmath39 with a constant speed @xmath87 , then it has a angular speed @xmath88 and the phase @xmath52 advances of @xmath89 each period @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , according to the second josephson equation , an average voltage @xmath91 develops across the junction equal to @xmath92 that is proportional to the fluxon velocity . in other words , the presence of a travelling fluxon sets the junction in a finite voltage state than can be easily measured on its ivc .    by also changing the bias current through the barrier the voltage drop changes and a new branch called zero field step ( zfs ) appears on the junction ivc",
    "; the zfs represents the relationship between the applied lorentz force ( proportional to the bias current ) and the fluxon speed ( proportional to the voltage ) .",
    "when @xmath93 fluxons travel around an ajtj , the last expression is easily generalized to give a junction voltage @xmath94 . in the last expression @xmath93",
    "is the total number of travelling fluxons and can be larger than the winding number @xmath64 if @xmath95 pairs are travelling around the annulus .",
    "therefore , we count the number of travelling fluxons by simply measuring the voltage across the ajtj .    these properties makes ajtjs very competitive with respect to other solid state systems proposed to test the zurek - kibble mechanism .",
    "our idea is to perform a large number of n - s transitions on the same ajtj with no external current or magnetic field ; at the end of each cycle the possible spontaneously generated fluxons are static .",
    "then we supply an external current that sets the fluxons ( if any ) in motion around the annulus and measure the number of travelling fluxons by a careful inspection of the junction ivc . due to the annihilation of a fluxon - antifluxon pair",
    ", this idea works well as long as the chances to spontaneously generate two fluxons are small .",
    "fig.1a , fig.1b and fig.1c represent the ivc of the same ajtj with no fluxon trapped , with one fluxon trapped and with two fluxons trapped , respectively .",
    "we note that with no trapped fluxons the zero voltage current is very large and only @xmath95 current steps appear at finite voltage . in the other two cases the supercurrent is rather small ( theoretically it should be vanishingly small in ideal , pinhole free barriers ) and large current branches can be observed at finite voltages corresponding to the fluxons and , possibly , @xmath95 pairs travelling around the junction .",
    "high quality @xmath96 jtjs were fabricated on @xmath97 thick silicon substrates using the trilayer technique in which the junction is realized in the window opened in a @xmath98 insulator layer .",
    "details of the fabrication process can be found in ref.@xcite . on each @xmath99 chip four jtjs",
    "were integrated , of which three ring shaped junctions having a mean circumference @xmath100 and a width @xmath101 and one @xmath102 overlap - type linear junction .",
    "the so called  idle region ",
    ", i.e. the overlapping of the wiring layer onto the base electrode was about @xmath103 for all the junctions .",
    "the thicknesses of the base , top and wiring layer were @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .    for all samples",
    "the high quality has been inferred by a measure of the i - v characteristic at @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , the subgap current @xmath108 at @xmath109 was small compared to the current rise @xmath110 in the quasiparticle current at the gap voltage @xmath111 , typically @xmath112 , the gap voltage was as large as @xmath113 and the maximum critical current @xmath114 was larger than @xmath115 for the overlap type junction .",
    "furthermore , the application of a strong enough external magnetic field in the barrier plane completely suppressed any josephson structures indicating the absence of electrical shorts in the barrier .",
    "it is important to mention that i ) no logarithmic singularity has been observed in the ivcs at low voltages and ii ) the temperature dependence of the critical current was linear as the temperature @xmath76 approached the critical temperature @xmath116 ; both these observations assure us that the junctions are symmetric , i.e. no detectable difference can be assumed between both the energy gaps @xmath117 and the critical temperatures @xmath118 of the junction electrodes @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the proximity of the barrier . the maximum josephson current density @xmath121 was of the order of @xmath122corresponding to a specific barrier normal resistance @xmath123 of about @xmath124 .",
    "many samples have been measured . for clarity",
    "only two will be discussed here .",
    "the geometrical and electrical ( at @xmath125 ) parameters of the two selected annular junctions on different wafers are listed in table i. they have the same geometry ( both the base and top electrode have a hole concentric to the ring , ) , but differ in the critical current densities , i.e. , in the normalized mean circumferences @xmath126 .",
    "the critical current density has been calculated from the measured quasiparticle current step , @xmath110 , at the gap voltage .",
    "the values of the barrier magnetic thickness @xmath127 has been used for numeric calculations . on each same chip a linear overlap - type junction with the same width , length and idle region was used in order to measure the junction swihart velocity @xmath128 with a geometry in which the effects of the self field are minimized .",
    "the value of @xmath129 , due to the effect of the idle region , is 1.5 times larger than that expected for a bare junction .",
    "this value of @xmath82 corresponds to a value of @xmath130 for the barrier effective specific capacitance .",
    "the data in table i show that both samples are high - quality , long ( @xmath131 ) annular jtjs .    [",

    "in order to vary the quenching time in the broadest possible range , we have realized the experimental setup schematically shown in fig.2 .",
    "a massive @xmath132 block held to the sample holder by two thin @xmath132 arms was used to increase the system thermal capacity .",
    "the chip was mounted on one side of this block and thermally loosely coupled to it by means of a @xmath133 thick teflon sheet .",
    "on the other side of the @xmath132 block , a thermoblock consisting of a @xmath134 carbon resistor and two thermometers in order to measure and to , if necessary , stabilize the @xmath132 block temperature , was mounted in good thermal contact .",
    "finally a small sized @xmath135 resistor , more precisely a surface mount resistor ( smr ) , was kept in good thermal contact with the chip by means of a small amount of vacuum grease .",
    "this system , due to the two heating elements placed in tight and loose thermal contact with the chip and with the proper choice of the thermal loads , allowed us to perform the sample quenching over two quite different time scales .",
    "in fact , by means of the resistor in the thermoblock , a long time scale was achieved by heating the chip through the @xmath132 block and the teflon sheet ; on the contrary , a short current pulse through the surface mount resistor on the chip , attained much short thermal cycles .",
    "these two completely different quenching techniques provide timescale ranges that do not overlap , leaving a gap between @xmath136 and @xmath137 , that would require a third quenching technique to be filled .",
    "we stress that just using a single sample holder with smaller heat capacity would not give us access to the same time - scales .",
    "we could not get quench times as short as those from the smr and , even with a very small exchange gas pressure , could not get times as long as those with the larger sample holder on using the mechanical pumps available to us .",
    "the whole system was kept in a vacuum tight can immersed in the @xmath138 bath at @xmath139 gas pipeline pressure .",
    "the pressure of @xmath139 gas inside the can could be varied in order to modify the heat exchange between the chip and the environment and , in turn , the speed of the sample cooling .",
    "a solenoid was wound around the can to provide a strong vertical magnetic field and helmholtz coils were instead placed inside the can to generate a weak horizontal magnetic field in the barrier plane in order to tune the critical currents of the annular junctions to their maximum values .    the temperature dependence of the junction gap voltage was exploited to monitor the temperature of the junction itself during the thermal cycle . fig.3a and",
    "fig.3b show the digitally measured @xmath140 for sample @xmath141 current biased on the quasiparticle curve at @xmath142 , ( i.e. , at about one fifth of @xmath110 at @xmath107 ) , for a slow and fast thermal cycle , respectively . in the case of fig.3a ,",
    "a @xmath143 current was fed to the thermoblock heater for about @xmath144 in order to increase the junction temperature up to its critical value where the sample ivc becomes a straight line with a slope corresponding to the junction normal resistance @xmath145 . in the case of fig.3b a @xmath146 high and @xmath147 wide ,",
    "voltage pulse was applied at the smr . in the figs.3 the time origin is arbitrarily set at the instant we began to feed the heating elements .",
    "it is important to observe that the time scale in fig.3a is about 50 times larger than that of fig.3b , although the curve shapes are quite similar .    in our samples",
    "the current jump at the gap voltage is very steep and , at @xmath148 , the voltage changes by less than @xmath149 when the current is changed from @xmath150 to @xmath151 of the total current jump @xmath110 and by less of @xmath152 at @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath154and @xmath155 and for this bias current , the junction voltage was equal to @xmath156and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "therefore , assuming that the electrode gap energies are equal @xmath158 , and that in the @xmath159 range we can neglect the thermal gap smearing , the analytical expression found by thouless@xcite for the gap energy in a strong - coupling superconductor    @xmath160    also applies to the junction gap voltage that is proportional to it .",
    "the dashed lines in figs.3 indicate the voltage threshold above which eq.[gap ] can be used to relate the junction voltage at its temperature , without any significant loss of accuracy .",
    "we like to mention that an experimental proof of eq.[gap ] in @xmath161 tunnel junctions was first evidenced by broom@xcite .",
    "fig.4a and fig.4b show the data reported in fig.3a and fig.3b , respectively , transformed according to eq.[gap ] , assuming for @xmath162 and @xmath6 the values @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , as found by monaco _",
    "_ @xcite on similar jtjs .",
    "now the dashed horizontal lines indicate the temperature threshold below which the temperature time dependence can be reliably accounted for by our measured data .",
    "the large noise at low temperature is the result of an amplification effect of eq.[gap ] , according to which the temperature variation corresponding to a given energy gap variation becomes larger and larger as the temperature becomes smaller .",
    "it would be very complicated to write the proper boundary conditions for the heat diffusion equation that would correctly model the full time dependence of the junction temperature .",
    "however , for our purposes we are only interested to the cooling process , and we successfully fit our data by a simple thermal relaxation equation :    @xmath165    with only two fitting parameters @xmath166 and @xmath167 , being @xmath168 and @xmath36 fixed at @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively . in eq.[relaxation ] @xmath166 is the time at which @xmath171 and @xmath167 is the relaxation time which sets the cooling time scale .",
    "the fitting curves are shown by the thick dashed lines in fig.4a and fig.4b , and correspond to a thermal relaxation time @xmath167 equal to @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "the quenching time @xmath174 can be obtained from its definition :    @xmath175    giving @xmath176 . for a thermal relaxation from the junction critical temperature down to the helium bath temperature",
    "we get @xmath177 .",
    "eventually , fig.5 display the values of the quenching times obtained with the process described above , both for the fast ( black squares with right vertical scale ) and slow ( red circles with left vertical scale ) cooling processes and for different values of the @xmath139 pressure inside the can .",
    "we observe that , by changing the exchange gas pressure and using the two techniques , the quenching time can be changed over a quite large range starting from tenths to tens of seconds . at the end of this paper we will discuss how it is possible to extend this range in both directions ; however , as we will show in next section , this range has shown to be large enough for our purposes .",
    "quenching experiments were carried out in a double @xmath178-metal shielded cryostat and the transitions from the normal to the superconducting states were performed with no current flowing in the heaters and the thermometers .",
    "both the junction voltage and current leads were shorted during all the thermal cycle .",
    "furthermore , the heat supplied to the sample was such that the maximum temperature reached by the junction was made slightly larger than its critical temperature , say at about @xmath179 , in order to make sure that also the bulk electrode critical temperature ( @xmath180 ) was overcome . in this case , according to eqs.[relaxation ] and [ tau_q ] , the value of the quenching time results in a correspondingly smaller @xmath181 . due to the approximation made by using eq.[relaxation ] and to the experimental uncertainty in the knowledge of the maximum temperature during each thermal cycle ,",
    "the value of the quenching times has been determined with an overall accuracy as large as @xmath182 . for each value of the quenching time , in order to estimate the trapping probability , we have carried out a set of 300 thermal cycles and at the end of each cycle the junction ivc was inspected in order to ascertain the possible spontaneous trapping of one or more fluxons .",
    "as we shall see later , the ajtjs are such that the zk causal length @xmath183 by an order of magnitude when @xmath184 . increasing and decreasing @xmath174 by an order of magnitude changes @xmath19 by less than a factor of two .",
    "thus the probability of finding a single fluxon after a quench is small . in the following",
    "we will focus our attention only on the probability @xmath185 to trap just one fluxon , although a few times we found clear evidence of two and , more seldom , three homopolar fluxons spontaneously trapped during the n - s transition .",
    "however , these events were too rare to be statistically significant .",
    "experimentally , we define @xmath185 as the ratio between the number of times in which at the end of the thermal cycle the junction ivc looks like that shown in fig.1b , i.e. with a tiny critical current and a large first zfs , and the number of attempts .",
    "it is worth to mention here that in the case of simultaneous trapping of a fluxon and an antifluxon , they would annihilate and leave no track of their formation .",
    "therefore , our definition of @xmath185 is not rigorous , but it is reasonable as far as the chances to trap two ( homo or heteropolar ) fluxons are negligibly small .",
    "similarly , an ivc similar to that shown in fig.1b could be the result of the simultaneous trapping of two fluxons and one antifluxon , or the other way around , but this event is less likely in our experimental situation . for the sake of completeness , it must be added that , in some cases , the ivc displayed either a depressed critical current without zfs structures or a zfs with an enhanced critical current .",
    "we explain them as due to the trapping of abrikosov vortices in the junction electrodes and nearby the barrier and we did not take in any account the occurrence of such events , since it is not known if and how the vicinity of abrikosov vortices influences the fluxon formation .",
    "when @xmath186 we estimate the probability of finding a fluxon in a single quench to be @xmath187 where , from eq.([jtj ] ) , @xmath188 .",
    "fig.6 shows on a log - log plot the measured probability @xmath185 of a single fluxon trapping obtained by quenching the sample @xmath141 300 times for each value of the quenching time @xmath174 changed by varying the exchange gas pressure and by using both the fast and slow quenching techniques .",
    "we observe that the points are quite scattered meaning that the data are statistically poor .",
    "further , for the reasons given earlier there is a gap between fast and slow quenches .",
    "nonetheless , we have clear evidence that i ) the trapping of a fluxon occurs on a purely statistical basis being identical the conditions for each thermal cycle and ii ) the probability to trap one fluxon is larger when the transition is performed at a faster speed ( smaller quenching time ) in a qualitative accordance with the causality principle .",
    "more precisely , we can distinguish the point to the lower right of the graph corresponding to the slow cycle process which gives in the average a probability to spontaneously trap a fluxon once every fourteen attempts , and the cloud of data to the upper left corresponding to the impulsive junction heating and giving an average probability of one successful event every about six attempts .",
    "this suggests that possible temperature gradients induced by the smr are not an important source of systematic error , since such gradients , with their slowly moving profiles , have a tendency to _ reduce _ defect production@xcite .",
    "regardless of the data spread , as suggested if eq.[p1 ] holds true , we attempted to fit the data with an allometric function @xmath189 with @xmath77 and @xmath190 being free fitting parameters .",
    "we found that the best fitting curve , shown by the solid line in fig.6 , has a slope @xmath191 .",
    "such a value of @xmath190 , although affected by a @xmath192 uncertainty , is in good agreement with the forth root square dependence expected for symmetric junction .    for the coefficient @xmath77 we found the best fitting value of @xmath193 ( @xmath194 in seconds ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the predicted value of @xmath195 .",
    "sample @xmath141 had a circumference @xmath100 .",
    "its effective superconductor thickness was @xmath196 @xmath197 . at the final temperature @xmath198 , the critical current density was @xmath199 and the josephson length was @xmath200 . from this , and @xmath82 given earlier , we infer that @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "this then gives @xmath203 , in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath190 , given the fact that we only expect agreement in overall normalization to somewhat better than an order of magnitude level . at this level",
    ", such a result is immune to systematic error in one or other of the measurement processes .",
    "after the problems ( discussed below ) of the experiments discussed in @xcite to find ( reliable ) defects at expected densities , if at all , our experiment shows that the zk estimate remains sensible .",
    "similar measurements have been carried out for sample @xmath204 .",
    "although not in contradiction with ( [ xibar ] ) , the results were affected by a data scattering even larger than that found for sample @xmath141 ( shown in fig.6 ) . this is due to a much smaller normalized length which , according to ( [ p1 ] ) , translates in a expected probability @xmath205 , for a given @xmath174 , about four times smaller ( since @xmath206 for this sample ) , far too small too get statistically significant data in reasonable times considering that these measurements are both very time and @xmath138 consuming . in order to have data comparable with those of sample @xmath141 , sample @xmath204 would have required a quenching times @xmath207 times larger .",
    "however the roughly measured probability @xmath205of 1 fluxon every 50 - 100 attempts is in fairly good agreement with the expected value .",
    "this shows that our fluxons are not spurious byproducts of the measurement mechanism .",
    "we consider this experiment to give a strong confirmation of the zurek - kibble predictions .",
    "we said in the introductory section of this paper that condensed matter experiments to test the zk predictions had given mixed results , and it is interesting to put this experiment in that context .    prior to our experiment",
    ", seven other experiments had been performed to test ( [ xibar ] ) , five with fixed @xmath174@xcite , two with variable @xmath11@xcite .",
    "[ in addition , the experiment cited earlier@xcite on jtjs by two of us ( r.m and j.m ) was compatible with ( [ jtj ] ) , although it had not been performed with a test of ( [ jtj ] ) in mind .",
    "it was this that motivated the experiment described here . ]    of those experiments with fixed @xmath174 , two were experiments@xcite on superfluid @xmath208 , which rely on the fact that , when it is bombarded with slow neutrons , energy is released which leads to a hot spot , with temperature @xmath209 , in the superfluid which then cools below @xmath6 .",
    "this leaves behind a tangle of vortices , the topological defects in this system , whose density can be measured . since @xmath174 is fixed by the nuclear process , it is not possible to confirm the predicted value @xmath210 .",
    "however , with only a single data point conflating both normalisation and @xmath0 both experiments are highly compatible with ( [ xibar ] ) .",
    "the remaining experiments with fixed @xmath174 were two@xcite on superfluid @xmath211 , and one@xcite on high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) .    in principle",
    ", the @xmath211 experiments@xcite , which use a pressure quench with a varying timescale @xmath174 to implement the transition , could have allowed for a more complete test , in this case to confirm @xmath212 ( after renormalisation group rescaling ) . yet",
    "again , vortices are the relevant defects . in practice",
    ", the most reliable published experiment@xcite sees no vortices . in this context",
    ", the vortices seen in an earlier @xmath211 experiment@xcite , at levels compatible with ( [ xibar ] ) , were most likely an artefact of the experimental setup .",
    "further experiments on @xmath211 are underway .    the fifth experiment@xcite , on htsc , measures total flux through a surface i.e. the variance in the topological charge , carried in this case by the abrikosov vortices .",
    "the vortex separation of ( [ xibar ] ) can be converted into a prediction for the variance , but no flux is seen in contradiction with this prediction , despite the phase separation that is a prerequisite for the result being seen elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there is no obvious explanation of this null result .",
    "an attempt to take gauge fields into account fully@xcite shows that there is an additional mechanism for vortex production in the thermal fluctuations of the magnetic field but , as yet , this seems insufficient to explain the result .",
    "such a mechanism will not apply to the jtjs considered in our experiment .",
    "these early experiments have either provided one data point for ( [ xibar ] ) , or have been null for whatever reason .",
    "two subsequent experiments have permitted varying quench rates and so an estimate for @xmath0 .",
    "the most recent@xcite involves the b@xmath213nard - marangoni conduction - convection transition , in which a homogeneous conduction state is broken into an hexagonal array of convection lines on heating .",
    "the defects here are not associated with the line zeroes of an order parameter field , and the viscosity - dependent @xmath0 does not match the zk prediction , most likely for that reason .",
    "the more relevant experiment@xcite is carried out in a non - linear optical system , with complex beam - phase the order parameter , satisfying a time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation with drift",
    ". there has been much numerical analysis@xcite of time - dependent ginzburg - landau systems , which show agreement with the zk predictions for scaling exponents .",
    "the control parameter in @xcite is not the temperature , but the light intensity . increasing it leads to pattern formation ( defects ) at a critical value .",
    "the predicted scaling parameter @xmath214 is recovered to good accuracy as @xmath215 , but agreement with normalisation is not stated .    given this relatively poor success rate in confirming ( [ xibar ] ) we are considering a further experiment to measure the zk scaling exponent , this time with manifestly non - symmetric ajtjs . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we observed that it should have been difficult to make jtjs truly symmetric , as those used here .",
    "however , in @xcite and @xcite we had not appreciated how the difference between symmetric and marginally non - symmetric jtjs is smeared by the proximity effect of the @xmath216 within the insulating layer .",
    "significantly non - symmetric jtjs require different fabrication techniques , but the value of @xmath0 inferred from the same causal arguments is @xmath217 , very different from the value of @xmath218 that we tested above .",
    "the data from our experiment is incompatible with @xmath219 .",
    "this does suggest that a further experiment , with markedly non - symmetric jtjs , should be performed .",
    "our experiments have demonstrated that quenching time of the order of 1 second give a rather large probability to trap one fluxons on ajtjs having a very large normalized length .",
    "however , very long junctions mean very large critical current densities that , in turn , require josephson barriers so thin that their quality and uniformity is often spoiled ; furthermore , in most cases , applications require intermediate length junction or even small junction . for these reasons , it would be highly desirable to compensate the reduced junction length with an increased quenching rate , as it is suggested by the findings for sample @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , we like to conclude the paper with some comments on the possible technical improvements that would allow to test the zk predictions over a broader quenching time range .",
    "firstly , @xmath194 can be trivially heightened by increasing the @xmath132 block thermal capacitance . on the contrary in order to lower the quenching time , that is to make the @xmath220 transition faster , it is needed to resort to new techniques since the maximum power that can be dissipated by the surface mount resistors sets an obvious lower threshold on @xmath174 .",
    "one possible way to reach this goal is to perform the junction thermal cycle by means of light pulses .",
    "light dissipates inside the superconducting electrodes , but not in the substrate providing a local junction heating that will relax much faster to the background temperature .",
    "we estimate that , by using a properly focussed pulsed light beam , the quenching time scale can be reduced to the @xmath221 range .",
