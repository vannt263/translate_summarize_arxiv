    "the hyperfine transitions in hydrogen , deuterium and helium-3 provide an opportunity to study the universe during its `` dark ages '' and the epoch of reionization that followed . from the radio continuum produced by redshifted lines of these elements , which can be observed in absorption or in emission against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , information about the thermal evolution , density perturbation spectrum and ionization history of the universe can be obtained .",
    "however , the correct interpretation of the measured signal requires knowledge of the processes which decouple the spin temperature of the atoms , @xmath2 , from the cmb temperature , @xmath3 . of these ,",
    "one of the most important during the epoch of reionization ( @xmath4 ) is ultraviolet pumping .",
    "resonant photons , such as ly@xmath5 , absorbed by the atom in the ground state may , after the decay of the excited state , leave the electron in a different hyperfine level .",
    "this process couples the spin temperature to the color temperature of the resonant photons , @xmath6 @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinetic temperature , @xmath9 is a constant proportional to the collisional excitation rate and @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the frequency of the hyperfine transition , @xmath14 is the spontaneous emission coefficient of the hyperfine transition and @xmath15 is the radiative deexcitation rate for the upper hyperfine level due to ly@xmath5 photons .",
    "as we show in this paper , the correct application of the above expressions requires us to take into account several physical processes which have previously been neglected .",
    "the first of these is the effect of the hyperfine splitting on the photon color temperature and intensity . in their pioneering papers ,",
    "wouthuysen ( 1952 ) and field ( 1958 , 1959 ) argued that in the limit of large optical depth , @xmath6 must approach the kinetic temperature of the atoms , to which the photons are coupled by recoil . as a result , since the ly@xmath5 resonance scattering depth for hydrogen atoms in the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) is extremely large , it has been customary ever since then to replace @xmath6 with @xmath8 in eqs . 1 and 2 above . that argument , however , did not take into account the effect of the hyperfine splitting on the change of photon energy during scattering .",
    "just as the spin temperature of the atoms is affected by the spectrum of the uv photons in the resonance line , so the uv spectrum around the resonance is in turn affected by the spin temperature",
    ". this backreaction shifts @xmath6 towards @xmath3 , thus reducing the coupling between the kinetic and spin temperatures .",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of scatterings on the radiation intensity near the resonance .",
    "chen & miralda - escude ( 2004 ) showed that , in a homogeneously expanding cosmological medium , the intensity of the continuum radiation drops around the resonance , thus reducing the value of @xmath10 . here",
    "we derive an analytical formula for the amplitude of this drop .",
    "we find significant discrepancies between our analytical calculations and some of their numerical results .",
    "furthermore , we extend their analysis to consider departures from pure hubble flow , associated with cosmic structure formation , such as a contracting medium which is appropriate for overdense regions . finally , we also consider scattering by resonant photons other than ly@xmath5 .",
    "ly@xmath5 photons have the highest scattering cross - section and , unlike higher resonances like ly@xmath1 , they are not destroyed by cascade after just a few scatterings . for these reasons ,",
    "the higher resonances are generally assumed to be unimportant .",
    "while correct for hydrogen , this assumption proves to be a very gross error in the case of deuterium , for which the role of ly@xmath1 photons is crucial .",
    "the corrections derived here to the hydrogen spin temperature which results from ly@xmath5 pumping in the early universe can have a significant effect on predictions of the 21-cm brightness temperature and its fluctuations . as we shall show their importance depends on the intensity of the uv background and the temperature of the igm .",
    "an approximation which is often made in recent theorectical predictions of the 21-cm background from the epoch reionization involves the assumption that the uv pumping background is high enough to make @xmath16 equal @xmath17 , while some other process ( e.g. x - ray background ) heats the igm without ionizing it , to @xmath18 @xcite . in that limit",
    "the 21-cm brightness temperature becomes independent of the actual value of @xmath16 , so the calculations are greatly simplified .",
    "however , the period either before the uv background reaches such high intensity or the neutral igm is heated is not well represented by this limiting approximation .",
    "this includes the epoch when the 21-cm signal is in absorption and potentially at its strongest .",
    "that is the case in which the results presented here will be important .",
    "while this paper was in preparation , a preprint of hirata ( 2006 ) was posted in which some of the above effects were calculated numerically .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between our analytic solutions and his numerical results . in  2 , we estimate the effect of the hyperfine transition on the color temperature of ly@xmath5 photons . in  3 , we calculate the change of intensity of ly@xmath5 photons due to their scattering by atoms . in  4 , we estimate the effect of these processes on the radio emission signals from d and @xmath0 . in  5 , we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of hydrogen and deuterium radio signals from the epoch of reionization and the end of the cosmic dark ages .",
    "consider a uv resonance transition which is followed by a single - photon decay to either hyperfine level of the ground state . upon such scattering by an atom , the energy of the incoming uv photon is changed due either to atomic recoil or to the hyperfine transition . in most cases ,",
    "both the kinetic and the spin temperature of the atoms is below the energy of the photons ( @xmath19 k ) , so on average the photons will lose energy in scatterings .",
    "the actual energy change , however , depends on the exact frequency of the photon . assuming that the energy distribution of atoms is maxwellian , we found that , in each scattering , the average energy loss of the photons is ( see appendix for details ) @xmath20 due to the atomic recoil and @xmath21 due to the change of the hyperfine state , where @xmath22 is the scattering cross - section , @xmath23 , @xmath13 is the frequency of the hyperfine transition",
    ", @xmath24 is the probability that a single resonance scattering results in a spin - flip and @xmath25 is the atomic mass .",
    "similarly , the total energy loss in the two processes may be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "consider the effect on the incoming radiation spectrum of repeated scatterings like those described above .",
    "this is relevant whenever the incoming photon is scattered without the possibility of photon destruction by cascade . for the radiation spectrum ,",
    "increasing @xmath29 and @xmath30 by the same factor produces the same effect as an increase in the optical depth .",
    "thus the color temperature of the resonant photons , which approaches a constant in the limit of high optical depth , can depend only on the ratio of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "considering either the recoil or the hyperfine transition alone would give us either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively , so obviously @xmath33 . for hydrogen ly@xmath5 , @xmath34 , and the color temperature is given by @xmath35 where all temperatures are in units of degrees kelvin .",
    "predictably the value of @xmath36 is between @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",

    ". [ tf ] is identical to the commonly used approximation for @xmath2 described in  1 , except that the value of the coupling constant @xmath38 is reduced by a factor @xmath39 . in the next section",
    "we will show that the radiative deexcitation rate , @xmath15 , is also affected by the changing spectrum .",
    "the ly@xmath5 pumping photons can be divided into two groups according to their origin .",
    "the first group ( `` continuum photons '' ) consists of continuum photons originally emitted in the frequency range between the ly@xmath5 and ly@xmath1 transitions , which , due to the cosmological redshift , are eventually shifted into the ly@xmath5 resonance .",
    "the second group ( `` injected photons '' ) owes its origin to photons originally emitted between ly@xmath40 and ly - limit frequencies . when these photons redshift into one of the lyman series resonances , they get absorbed by atoms , which are thereby excited to @xmath41 state .",
    "since the subsequent cascade mostly likely goes directly to the ground state , most photons are reemitted close to their original frequency ( with a small change due to a doppler shift ) and are soon reabsorbed .",
    "however , after just a few scatterings most of the original photons are destroyed by splitting into several photons .",
    "roughly two thirds of all cascades from @xmath41 states and all off the cascades from @xmath42 state , go through the intermediate @xmath43 state , which decays by two - photon emission .",
    "the rest pass through the @xmath44 state , whose decay produces a ly@xmath5 photon . unlike the `` continuum photons '' , which reach the ly@xmath5 resonance from the blue wing , the``injected photons '' are produced directly in its center .",
    "when the ly@xmath5 optical depth is high , the spectrum of the photons near the ly@xmath5 resonance can be found using the fokker - planck approximation . in the comoving frame of the gas ,",
    "the intensity @xmath45 varies with frequency in the neighborhood of the resonance at @xmath46 according to the following ( see appendix b for derivation ) @xmath47j(x)=2\\gamma",
    "j_0(1-k_\\alpha \\theta(x)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the frequency distance from the line center in dimensionless units , @xmath49 is the normalized absorption cross - section , @xmath50 is the intensity on the far red side of the resonance ( i.e. , where it is unaffected by scattering ) of either the continuum or injected photons , and @xmath51 equals zero for continuum or unity for injected photons .",
    "if hyperfine transitions are neglected , the recoil parameter , @xmath52 , equals @xmath53 @xcite and @xmath54 is the gunn - peterson optical depth to ly@xmath5 resonance scattering . including the effect of the hyperfine transition gives a correction of order @xmath55 to the values of @xmath40 and @xmath52 ( see appendix b ) . generally , however , this correction results in just a few per cent change in the radiation intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ jh ] ) . neglecting terms of order @xmath40 , the solution of equation ( [ j ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient of the ly@xmath5 transition . when the optical depth is low or the temperature is high , so that thermal width of the line becomes similar to the width of absorption feature , the approximations we used in deriving equations ( [ j])-([j1 ] ) break down and higher order terms become more important @xcite . however , under such conditions the effect of ly@xmath5 scattering on the radiation intensity is in any case negligible and the equation ( [ j1 ] ) still yields the correct answer .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath8 , is coupled to @xmath3 by inverse compton scatterings at redshifts @xmath59 .",
    "thereafter , until the igm is reheated during the epoch of reionization , the gas temperature falls adiabatically , according to @xmath60 .",
    "prior to reionization , the optical depth of the neutral hydrogen evolves according to @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the local values of the hubble constant ( to account for departure from unperturbed hubble expansion ) and the overdensity , respectively .",
    "figure [ jh ] shows an example of the spectrum profile , @xmath64 , for conditions corresponding to unheated and unperturbed neutral hydrogen at @xmath65 .",
    "predictably , near the center of the line , where frequent scatterings with atoms make photons lose energy faster , @xmath64 shows a dip , whose amplitude is the same for the continuum and injected photons @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( for hydrogen @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 is a hypergeometric function and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the bessel functions of the first kind . conveniently @xmath72 has the same value for continuum and injected photons .    typically , @xmath73 is well below unity , which allows us to approximate the eq .",
    "[ j3 ] by @xmath74 since most of the scatterings happen around @xmath75 , the overall scattering rate and @xmath10 fall by the same factor , @xmath76 .",
    "hirata ( 2006 ) found this factor numerically , separately using a fokker - planck approximation and monte carlo simulations .",
    "figure [ figh ] shows excellent agreement between our equations [ j3 ] and [ j4 ] , and hirata s numerical fit .",
    "equation ( [ j ] ) may after a slight change be used for a contracting , rather than expanding , medium , according to @xmath77j(x)=2\\gamma j_0(k_\\alpha\\theta(-x)-1 ) .",
    "\\hspace{0.5cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a contracting gas , the energy loss from scatterings slows down the blueshifting of the photons .",
    "therefore instead of falling @xmath64 actually rises _ above _ @xmath50 at the center , according to @xmath78{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\pi   \\zeta     ^{2/3 } bi\\left(\\left(\\frac{3 \\zeta } { 2}\\right)^{2/3 }    \\right)+\\ ,     _",
    "1f_2\\left(1;\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3};\\frac{\\zeta     ^2}{4}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the airy function .",
    "once again , this result applies to both continuum and injected photons .",
    "when absorption of a ly@xmath1 photon excites a hydrogenic atom to the 3p state , the decay proceeds either directly to the 1s state , in which case another ly@xmath1 photon is emitted , or via 2s state , in which case the original ly@xmath1 photon is split into three photons . at redshifts @xmath80 , the optical depth for deuterium ly@xmath1 photons",
    "is below @xmath81 . since only 1 in @xmath82 of the absorbed photons",
    "is destroyed by three - photon reemission , the ratio of ly@xmath1 to ly@xmath5 scatterings does not drop as drastically for deuterium as for hydrogen , whose ly@xmath1 optical depth is much higher .",
    "still , this ratio is rather low ( @xmath83 if the uv continuum spectrum is nearly flat between ly@xmath5 and ly@xmath40 ) , so ly@xmath1 photons would not have been important for deuterium either , if their color temperature were determined by the same process as for ly@xmath5 . unlike ly@xmath5 photons , however , whose energy is changed only slightly by the scatterings and whose spectrum near the resonance is relatively flat , the spectrum around the ly@xmath1 resonance is determined predominantly by photon destruction . as photons are redshifted across the resonance , more and more of them",
    "are destroyed , thus making the red wing of the resonance much weaker than the blue .",
    "since the ly@xmath1 optical depth of deuterium is not very high , the fokker - planck approximation can no longer be used , and the integral equation must be solved instead . for an isotropically expanding medium ,",
    "the transfer equation for radiation in a steady state takes the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the redistribution function @xcite .",
    "for the photons which survive the scattering ( i.e. , for those which are not destroyed by cascade ) @xmath86)/2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "taking into account the fraction of the photons that are destroyed , @xmath87 , gives the full redistribution function @xmath88)/2 $ ] .",
    "for moderate optical depth the normalized absorption cross - section can be approximated as @xmath89 . using this",
    "we obtain @xmath90)j(x')dx'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving equation ( [ d ] ) numerically ( see fig .",
    "[ jd ] ) , we found that , around the ly@xmath1 resonance , the color temperature is @xmath91 k.    if the uv radiation field is sufficiently strong that we can ignore both the cmb photons and collisional coupling , the spin temperature is determined by the relative numbers of scatterings of ly@xmath5 and ly@xmath1 photons with deuterium atoms ( the combined effect of ly@xmath40 and higher resonances is generally a few times smaller than that of ly@xmath1 ) . taking into account the higher scattering cross - section of ly@xmath5 photons and the decrease of ly@xmath1 intensity at the resonance , we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the ratio of ly@xmath5 to ly@xmath1 photons . for hot radiation sources , which produce most of the uv photons , @xmath93 is close to the ratio of the bandwidths producing the photons @xmath94 .",
    "thus deuterium can appear in emission with respect to the cmb radiation even if its kinetic temperature is below the cmb temperature .",
    "the case of @xmath0 emission is a relatively simple one . since the corrections to radiation intensity and color temperature that were estimated in  2 and  3",
    "are important only at low kinetic temperatures , we can neglect them for ionized helium which becomes abundant only at @xmath95 k. furthermore , unlike deuterium , @xmath0 resonances are to the red of @xmath96 .",
    "thus practically all resonant photons except ly@xmath5 are prevented from reaching @xmath0 , being instead absorbed and destroyed by @xmath96 ions first .",
    "we have shown that the accurate modeling of the photon spectrum around the hydrogen ly@xmath5 resonance results in a significant correction to the radiative pumping efficiency . for the cosmological parameters given by the latest wmap results , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xcite and unperturbed hubble expansion ,",
    "@xmath2 is correctly given by eq .",
    "[ tf ] if @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the previously used coupling constant , given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the oscillator strength of the ly@xmath5 transition and @xmath50 is the intensity at ly@xmath5 resonance , when the backreaction caused ly@xmath5 scattering by is neglected .    prior to reionization",
    "the mean differential brightness temperature of the hydrogen 21 cm signal is given by @xmath104 from the above equation it follows that the strongest signal is obtained when the spin temperature is well below @xmath3 , in which case @xmath105 .",
    "when radiation sources begin to form , @xmath2 indeed starts to drop as it decouples from @xmath3 and approaches @xmath8 instead .",
    "however , if x - ray photons are present , with an intensity which increases simultaneously with those in the uv , these would at the same time heat the gas , so that , eventually , @xmath8 and @xmath2 become greater than @xmath3 .",
    "chen & miralda - escude ( 2004 ) estimated that in this case the strongest signal ( @xmath106 mk ) arises when the gas is still in absorption and @xmath2 is not yet fully decoupled from @xmath3 , i.e. , when the signal is still very sensitive to the changes in the coupling strength , @xmath38 .",
    "a further complication arises from the small - scale density fluctuations .",
    "even though the resolution of planned future experiments is currently limited to objects of at least @xmath107 mpc size , which are still mostly in the linear regime at the relevant epoch , the spectrum around the resonance is determined by conditions on much smaller ( @xmath108 kpc ) scale , where nonlinear departures from hubble flow are important . to illustrate the signal dependence on the small scale - structure we have plotted the spin temperature of the adiabatically evolving hydrogen gas at @xmath109 at various overdensities ( figs .",
    "[ ga]-[t2 ] ) .",
    "in general , there is no one - to - one relationship between the density and the expansion rate , so to make this figure we assumed that all over / underdensities evolve as spherical `` top - hat '' density perturbations ( which explains the break at @xmath110 where the gas switches from expansion to contraction ) .",
    "this yields a unique dependence of @xmath111 on local overdensity for a given redshift ( fig .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ t1 ] for different values of @xmath112 ( i.e. different intensities ) , which can be related to the ratio of photons in the uv background in the frequency range between ly@xmath5 and ly - limit per atom , @xmath113 , according to @xmath114 .",
    "the spin temperature changes significantly when the corrections to the coupling constant ( eq .",
    "[ cor ] ) are taken into account , except when the radiation intensity is very high .",
    "figure [ t2 ] shows how the local contributions to the overall 21 cm signal change after including this correction .",
    "the net effect of departures from uniform hubble expansion on the mean 21 cm signal depends on the weighted contributions from gas at different overdensities , and , since this dependence is non - linear , the contributions of over- and under - dense regions do not cancel each other out .    for hyperfine transition of deuterium , we found that a drastic difference is made by inclusion of ly@xmath1 photons in the analysis , which practically do not affect hydrogen .",
    "thus the ratio between the deuterium and hydrogen radio signals is not constant , but depends sensitively on the uv spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , this eliminates the possibility of the precision radio measurements of d / h ratio suggested by sigurdson & furlanetto @xcite , except for the period before the first uv sources turn on ( @xmath115 ) .",
