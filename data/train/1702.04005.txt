    "for a distant observer , a black hole ( bh ) should be seen as a dark spot in the sky which is referred to as a bh shadow. size and shape of the shadow are determined by parameters of the bh and the observer position . at present , an increasing interest concerning investigations of the shadow is connected with the challenging perspective of possible observation of the shadow of the supermassive bh in the center of our galaxy .",
    "two projects are under way now to observe this shadow : the event horizon telescope ( http://eventhorizontelescope.org ) and the blackholecam ( http://blackholecam.org ) .    using estimates of the bh mass",
    ", we can calculate the assumed size of its shadow .",
    "_ vice versa _ , what we can get from observation of the shadow angular radius is the bh mass .    if a bh is rotating , the shadow is not circular , but oblate and deformed .",
    "the second thing we could hope to measure is the oblateness ( the ratio of the horizontal and vertical angular diameters ) of the shadow , see fig .",
    "[ figure - oblateness ] .",
    "the oblateness can give us information about the bh spin .",
    "it is important also that the deformation depends on the viewing angle of observer : for the equatorial observer the deformation is strongest , while for the polar observer the deformation is absent .    to the best of our knowledge , while many analytical investigations and numerical simulations have been done in the literature ( for example , see @xcite ) , there is no direct explicit relation between the shadow oblateness and the bh spin , even for the observer in the equatorial plane .",
    "moreover , it would be useful to have an analytical dependence of the deformation on the observer viewing angle .",
    "analytical investigations of the bh shadow start from work of synge @xcite , where the angular radius of the shadow was calculated for the schwarzschild bh , as a function of the bh mass and of the radial coordinate of the observer .",
    "the shape of the kerr bh shadow was calculated by bardeen @xcite . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the size and the shape of the shadow were calculated for the whole class of plebaski - demiaski spacetimes .",
    "extraction of the spin from the shadow deformation was discussed in papers @xcite .",
    "results of the paper @xcite allow anyone to calculate the shadow of kerr bh for any position of the observer , which means arbitrary radial distance from bh and arbitrary inclination of observer . nevertheless , _",
    "analytical _ calculation of the horizontal and vertical angular diameters in general case is complicated .",
    "analytical calculation of the shadow means the following : every point of the curve is evaluated as an analytical function of a special parameter , see details below .",
    "this parameter is changed in some range , and boundaries of this range are also subject of evaluation .",
    "namely , we need to find zeros of a high - order polynomials .",
    "therefore in the general case results for diameters can not be presented in closed analytical form ( as explicit functions of spin and inclination ) .",
    "calculation of the horizontal and vertical angular diameters is addressed in the paper @xcite .",
    "the authors consider the equatorial plane of the kerr bh and explain how to calculate the horizontal and vertical angular diameters of the shadow as a function of the bh mass , spin , and the radial coordinate of the observer . as an example of the situation when",
    "results can be written explicitly , the authors have calculated the horizontal and vertical angular diameters of the shadow for extreme kerr bh .",
    "our goal is to obtain a simple analytical dependence of oblateness on the spin and inclination which will be easy to use .",
    "this goal is achieved by using the approximation of a nearly extreme bh with @xmath0 , @xmath1 . in this approximation , it becomes possible to obtain an explicit dependence which , however , is still too cumbersome . for further simplifications",
    ", we consider the case of nearly equatorial observer .",
    "remarkably , we obtain that the dependence of the deformation on the spin is strong : the oblateness is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "it means that a small deviation of spin from the extreme value leads to a notable change of the shadow . at the same time , the dependence of deformation on the viewing angle is quadratic and therefore not as important .    in practical situations",
    ", it is expected that the observer could measure the horizontal and vertical angular diameters of the bh , and knows the oblateness .    as a main result",
    ", we present compact formulas for : ( i ) expression of the spin lower limit via oblateness ( ii ) direct calculation of the spin via oblateness and viewing angle , in case the latter is known from other observations .",
    "we will work in the kerr metric with @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5    we consider an observer at the position @xmath6 .",
    "equations for calculation of the shadow curve for this observer can be found from the equations ( 24)(26 ) of grenzebach , perlick , lmmerzahl @xcite simplified for the kerr metric : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the celestial coordinates for our observer , see fig .",
    "[ figure - observer ] .",
    "these two angles determine the shape of the shadow as a function of the parameter @xmath11 which means the radius of critical spherical photon orbit .",
    "parameter @xmath11 is changed from its minimal @xmath12 to maximum @xmath13 value , they are found from eqs @xmath14 @xmath15    we restrict ourselves to the consideration of distant observer , and for @xmath16 , the formula ( [ theta ] ) can be simplified : @xmath17    it is convenient to use cartesian coordinates in observer sky ( see @xcite ) : @xmath18    the shape of the shadow can be characterized by its left border @xmath19 , the right border @xmath20 , and the maximum value of @xmath21-coordinate , @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ figure - oblateness ] .",
    "these values give us the horizontal @xmath23 and vertical @xmath24 diameters of the shadow .",
    "we are interested in calculation of oblateness @xmath25 .",
    "let us consider the equatorial observer .",
    "for the schwarzschild case , the shadow is circular and @xmath26 . with increasing of @xmath27 , the shadow is shifted to the right , see fig .",
    "3 ( left ) . at small @xmath28 , the left and right borders",
    "are shifted equally , and the horizontal diameter @xmath29 is not changing @xcite . at @xmath30 ,",
    "the borders tend to @xmath31 and @xmath32 . at the same time",
    ", the vertical diameter stays constant @xmath33 for all values of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the equatorial observer , the oblateness ranges from @xmath34 for the schwarzschild case ( @xmath35 ) to @xmath36 for the extreme kerr case ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "let us now consider the nearly extreme kerr bh @xmath37 with @xmath1 .",
    "the remarkable thing we have seen from plotting the shadow is that the displacement of the left border in comparison with the extreme kerr case is proportional to @xmath2 : @xmath38 whereas the right border is shifting proportionally to @xmath39 : @xmath40    with this in mind , we seek the solution of ( [ min ] ) in the form @xmath41 substituting the expressions for @xmath27 and @xmath12 in the equation ( [ min ] ) and keeping the terms with @xmath2 and @xmath39 , we obtain the three equations for the unknowns @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . the equation for @xmath42 is polinomial and has several solutions .",
    "we need to choose the one which is @xmath45 and tends to @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "we get that @xmath48 , and then find @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the left border of the shadow is calculated as @xmath49 in this manner , we find @xmath50 up to the terms @xmath51 .",
    "the terms @xmath51 are presented only in @xmath50 , @xmath39-corrections in all other expressions start from @xmath39 and therefore can be neglected .",
    "it means that in all other values we can put @xmath30 .    solving ( [ max ] ) for @xmath13 with @xmath30 , we choose a root which tends to @xmath52 when @xmath47 : @xmath53 the right border of the shadow is calculated as @xmath54 horizontal size of the shadow has the form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are functions too cumbersome to be written here",
    ".    vertical size of the shadow can be found by introducing the function @xmath58 : @xmath59 taking @xmath60 with @xmath30 , we find @xmath61 , and then we obtain the maximum value of vertical coordinate : @xmath62 vertical size of the shadow is : @xmath63    we now find the deformation @xmath64 as : @xmath65    supposing that the observer directly measures the value of @xmath64 and knows the angle @xmath66 , we can write that : @xmath67 +",
    "our purpose is to get compact formulas , hence further we will consider the observer which is close to the equatorial plane ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we will use the viewing angle @xmath69 instead the inclination angle @xmath66 : @xmath70 .",
    "the angle @xmath69 indicates the inclination of the observer with respect to the equatorial plane ; for observer in the equatorial plane @xmath71 , for the polar observer @xmath72 .",
    "we write in all formulas @xmath73 and keep the small terms @xmath74 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath75 @xmath76 horizontal size of the shadow is : @xmath77 we see that up to the terms proportional to @xmath78 , the horizontal diameter of the bh does not depend on the viewing angle : if the observer looks at the extreme kerr bh shadow and rises over the equatorial plane , the shadow is shifted to the left as a whole . at the same time , the vertical diameter is becoming smaller : @xmath79    for oblateness @xmath80 we obtain : @xmath81 and expression of the spin via oblateness and the viewing angle is : @xmath82    for observer in the equatorial plane ( @xmath83 , @xmath71 ) , we have : @xmath84 and the bh spin is calculated as @xmath85 value of @xmath27 calculated for the equatorial plane is the lower limit of the spin of the bh at a given oblateness @xmath64 : if the observer is not located in the equatorial plane , the larger value of the spin is required to obtain the same deformation .",
    "our conclusions :    \\(i ) in the approximation of the nearly extreme kerr bh with the spin @xmath0 and a nearly equatorial observer with @xmath86 , we have investigated the dependence of the deformation on both the bh spin and the observer s viewing angle . remarkably , we obtain that the dependence of the deformation on the spin is strong : the deformation is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "it means that a small difference of the spin from @xmath46 can lead to a notable deviation of the observed deformation from the extreme value @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "\\(ii ) knowing the oblateness by measuring the horizontal and vertical diameters of the shadow , one can easily obtain the lower limit on the bh spin by the formula ( [ main - result ] ) , without need to construct or model the entire curve of the shadow .",
    "\\(iii ) if the viewing angle is known from other observations , one can directly calculate the spin using ( [ main - result2 ] ) .",
