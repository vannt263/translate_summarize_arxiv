    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is widely accepted as the paradigm within which to understand the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "a defining characteristic of this model on the scale of galaxies is the prediction that central densities of dark matter haloes rise as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , over the radii which govern the inner rotation curves of galaxies . over the last decade ,",
    "numerous studies  principally numerical  have sought to quantify and understand this divergent or _",
    "cuspy _ behaviour @xcite .",
    "in particular , the continued assertion that the rotation curves of dark matter dominated systems such as low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies require mass profiles with finite constant density cores or shallow `` cusps '' @xcite has prompted many detailed investigations into the consequences of these observations for the cdm model .",
    "this disparity between the predicted and inferred mass profiles appears to call into question the most basic assumption of the cdm model , namely the nature of the dark matter , and constitutes a critical challenge to the paradigm .",
    "indeed , reconciling theory and observation has come to represent a central problem in contemporary cosmology and is arguably one of its most contentious issues , as illustrated by recent analyses of the systematic effects that could affect high resolution rotation curve data of lsb galaxies and the fitting procedures used in mass modeling .",
    "* hereafter db03 ) have argued that the signature of cdm cusps should be clear in the data and so the model s predictions are inconsistent with observations , while @xcite , in some cases using overlapping data , find no compelling evidence for disagreement between cuspy cdm haloes and observed rotation curves .",
    "these studies focused on the shape of lsb galaxy rotation curves , which rise approximately linearly with radius in the manner one would expect if the mass density profile contained only a shallow central cusp or a constant density core ; if the underlying profile is strongly cuspy , it is argued , the rotation curve should rise more rapidly at small radii . however , the rate at which the rotation velocity increases with radius is sensitive to how centrally _ concentrated _ the mass distribution within the halo is  the more centrally concentrated the halo , the more rapidly its rotation curve will rise .",
    "thus , a slowly rising rotation curve could be interpreted as indicative of a halo that is weakly centrally concentrated .",
    "+ the seminal work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) formalised this concept of concentration .",
    "based on a comprehensive suite of simulations , they established their _",
    "universal _ mass profile that could describe the structure of an average dark matter halo in dynamical equilibrium , independent of its mass or the choice of cosmological parameters and initial density perturbation spectrum .",
    "the circular velocity of a nfw halo can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius @xmath8 normalised by the virial radius @xmath9 times the critical density of the universe at a given epoch ; for the @xmath10cdm model , @xmath11 .",
    "] , @xmath12 is the _ concentration _",
    "parameter where @xmath13 is the scale radius , and @xmath14 is the virial velocity of the halo . from equation  [ eq : nfw ] , we observe that the circular velocity rises as @xmath15 at small radii , and the larger @xmath2 , the greater @xmath16 .",
    "nfw found that , on average , concentration decreased with increasing virial mass , and they understood that this reflected the mean density of the universe at the time of the halo s formation ; more massive systems collapse at later times when the mean density of the universe is lower .",
    "@xcite and subsequent studies by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b01 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ens ) formulated prescriptions that allow the concentration of a given halo of a given mass in a given cosmology to be predicted . within the b01 or ens formulations , we expect a typical galaxy mass halo ( @xmath17 ) forming in the cosmology to have a concentration parameter @xmath18 .",
    "if lsb galaxies occupy dark matter haloes of the kind that form in the model , then we might expect typical concentrations of @xmath18 . both @xcite and db03 have considered the distribution of concentrations obtained from fits to their lsb galaxy rotation curve data , and as illustrated in figure 3 of @xcite and figure 1 of db03 , the distribution shows two well defined peaks , one at @xmath19 , the other at @xmath20 .",
    "the preference for the data to favour such a low value of concentration appears troubling for the cdm model .",
    "the mass - concentration relation , predicts that @xmath19 is typical of low mass clusters with @xmath21 rather than low mass galaxies , and the @xmath22 scatter in concentration at a given mass is expected to be @xmath23 at most .",
    "implicit in this comparison is the untested assumption that the haloes of lsb galaxies are typical for their mass .",
    "lsb galaxies are considered ideal for probing the structure of dark matter haloes because the baryons contribute minimally to the rotation curve , greatly facilitating the process of decomposing the rotation curve into baryonic and halo contributions . however , if the haloes of lsb galaxies are biased with respect to the general halo population , then this is a biased comparison .",
    "indeed , it has been noted observationally that detailed mass models of lsb galaxies reveal dark matter haloes that are less dense and more extended than those of high surface brightness ( hsb ) counterparts of similar masses ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting lower concentrations than might be expected . furthermore , there are theoretical grounds to expect that lsb galaxies inhabit a special class of haloes .",
    "the low surface brightness of lsb galaxies is a consequence of their low central density .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption that specific angular momentum of the baryons is approximately conserved during their dissipation into a rotationally supported disk , then the scale length of the resulting disk is related to the angular momentum of the dark matter halo , and we anticipate that lsb galaxies will occupy dark matter haloes with larger spin parameters ( a measure of the degree to which the halo is supported by angular momentum ; see  [ sec : results ] ) than their hsb counterparts .",
    "these considerations suggest that lsb galaxies occupy dark matter haloes with low concentrations and high spin parameters , echoing the conclusions of previous studies @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the correlation between concentration and spin , as envisaged by  @xcite ,  @xcite , and @xcite , is sufficient to explain the distribution of concentrations observed by @xcite and db03 for their sample of lsb galaxies . for this purpose",
    ", we have analysed a statistical sample of haloes , with masses in the range @xmath24 , forming in a high resolution cosmological  n - body simulation , and observe a trend for a halo s spin parameter to increase with decreasing concentration .",
    "using the analytic prescription presented in @xcite , we use the halo spins to estimate disk scale lengths and surface densities for our hypothetical sample of galactic disks , and hence construct the distribution of concentrations we might expect for the host haloes of lsb galaxies .",
    "although there are important differences between the distribution we recover and those presented in @xcite and db03 , we observe that the peak at @xmath19 is reproduced in our distribution .",
    "we present the results of our analysis in the next section (  [ sec : results ] ) and discuss their significance in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our results are based on analysis of the @xmath25=0 output of a @xmath26 particle cosmological n - body simulation of a periodic volume , @xmath27 on a side , that was run assuming the @xmath10cdm cosmology ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) using the gadget2 code ( springel et al .",

    "this has the effect of lowering the measured concentration of the halo by @xmath41 ( approximately independent of concentration ) relative to that predicted by either the b01 or ens prescriptions , reflecting the smaller measured virial radius relative to a fixed scale radius .",

    "+    we begin by considering the distribution of halo concentrations @xmath43 relative to their spin parameters @xmath54 for all fof groups with masses between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as shown in figure  [ fig : lambdac ] .",
    "although there is large variation in @xmath54 at a given @xmath43 , we note a discernible trend for @xmath54 to increase with decreasing @xmath43 ; the median increases from @xmath57 at @xmath58 to @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "this is precisely the behaviour we would expect the host haloes of lsb galaxies to display , in agreement with previous work @xcite .",
    "having established a correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath43 , we wish to derive the quantity that characterises a lsb galaxy , namely its central surface brightness @xmath61 ; our particular treatment follows that of @xcite .",

    "the central surface brightness @xmath61 can be estimated by assuming a particular choice of local mass - to - light @xmath72 ratio , which is a combination of the gas @xmath73 and star @xmath74 ratios .",
    "@xcite indicates a local @xmath75 , and de blok ( 2004 , private communication ) suggests @xmath76 ; in what follows , we adopt @xmath77 .    by definition ,",
    "a lsb galaxy is one whose central surface brightness satisfies @xmath78 mag arcsec@xmath79 ; typical b - band values lie in the range @xmath80 mag arcsec@xmath79 for lsb galaxies , compared with @xmath81 mag arcsec@xmath79 for hsb galaxies . converting to central surface densities ,",
    "we select lsb and hsb galaxies by applying cuts of @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , where @xmath67 is expressed in units of @xmath84 .",
    "+    in figure  [ fig : csig0 ] , we demonstrate how central surface density @xmath67 correlates with concentration @xmath43 , where @xmath67 is evaluated using equations  ( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) and ( [ eq : rd ] ) .",
    "as expected , there is a clear trend for haloes with lower concentrations to host disks that have lower central surface densities ; the median increases from @xmath85 at @xmath60 to @xmath86 at @xmath58 .",
    "we quantify this trend by computing the mean value of @xmath43 in bins of width 0.5 in @xmath87 and performing a linear regression over the range @xmath88 to obtain the relation , @xmath89 shown by the solid curve in figure  [ fig : csig0 ] ; outside of this range , @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "this correlation is due in equal parts to the direct dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath43 and on the indirect dependence via the spin parameter .",
    "for a fixed @xmath67 , we find the distribution of @xmath43 has a width of @xmath94 , essentially independent of the precise value of @xmath67 .",
    "+    finally , in figure  [ fig : chist ] , we show distributions of concentrations corresponding to the host haloes of lsb ( red histogram ; hereafter the lsb distribution ) and hsb ( blue histogram ; hereafter the hsb distribution ) galaxies by applying the observationally motivated cuts in central surface density ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 for lsb and hsb disks respectively ) discussed above . for comparison , we show also the distribution derived from fits to high resolution lsb galaxy rotation curves presented in figure 1 of db03 ( hereafter the db03 distribution ) .",
    "there are two main points worthy of note in this figure .",
    "firstly , we find that the lsb and hsb distributions peak at different values of @xmath43 ; the peak value of the hsb distribution occurs at @xmath95 , compared with @xmath96 for the lsb distribution .",
    "secondly , the values of @xmath43 at which the lsb and db03 distributions peak are in remarkably good agreement ",
    "@xmath96  although we note that the overall shapes of the respective distributions differ ; the db03 distribution has an additional well defined peak at @xmath97 and a tail extending to @xmath98 .",
    "however , the peak at @xmath97 in the db03 distribution is an artifact of the fitting procedure ; when the nfw fits were clearly unphysical , such as when they preferred negative values of @xmath43 , the value of @xmath43 was arbitrarily set to 0.1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , these haloes should be characterized as haloes which can not be fit by the nfw form , rather than haloes with a well - defined concentration of 0.1 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath1@xmath43 relation implies that very high concentration haloes are exclusively very low mass systems .",
    "in particular , the observed halo with @xmath99 is likely a dwarf galaxy whose mass falls well below our low mass cutoff of @xmath100 @xcite .    we can estimate the likelihood that the db03 , lsb and hsb samples are drawn from the same distribution by applying the k - s test .",
    "if we include the entire db03 sample , we find that it is inconsistent with both the lsb ( @xmath101 ) and hsb ( @xmath102 ) samples ; ignoring the peak at @xmath97 , we find reasonable agreement with the lsb sample ( @xmath103 ) but not the hsb sample ( @xmath104 ) ; and finally , ignoring both the peak at @xmath97 as well as the high-@xmath43 tail , we find improved agreement with the lsb sample ( @xmath105 ) but similarly poor agreement with the hsb sample ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the status of lsb galaxies as dark matter dominated systems is a well established observational result @xcite and their rotation curves can provide , in principle , clean probes of the distribution of dark matter within their host haloes .",
    "however , as the divergent conclusions reached by the recent studies of db03 and @xcite demonstrate , the question of whether the shape of lsb galaxy rotation curves can be used to place strong constraints on the nature of the dark matter and hence the validity of the model on small scales continues to be a matter of heated debate .",
    "we have not attempted to address this particular issue in our study  the mass resolution of our simulation is insufficient to reliably recover halo density profiles on the scales that are of most interest for comparison with observations @xcite  but it is unlikely that their structure will differ significantly from that predicted by nfw and more recent studies @xcite . instead we have focused on the related topic of the degree to which haloes of the kind predicted to host lsb galaxies in the cosmology are centrally concentrated .",
    "our analysis indicates that a correlation exists between concentration @xmath43 and spin @xmath54 for haloes with masses in the range we have studied , @xmath107 , such that haloes with low values of @xmath43 tend to have high values of @xmath54 , and vice versa . by assuming that the baryons associated with these low-@xmath43 , high-@xmath54 haloes approximately conserve angular momentum during the formation of the galaxy disk",
    ", we recast this trend as one between the central surface density of the disk , @xmath67 , and the concentration of its host halo , @xmath43 , using the formalism of @xcite . adopting an observationally motivated local mass - to - light ratio , @xmath72 , we identified those haloes most likely to contain lsb galaxy disks , thus allowing us to construct a distribution of concentrations that we compared with the distribution of inferred concentrations presented in db03 .",
    "although there are important differences between the db03 and our hypothetical lsb distributions , namely the presence of a significant number of galaxies for which @xmath97 and several high-@xmath43 systems , we recover a peak value of @xmath96 that is in good agreement with observations .",
    "in addition , when we exclude the @xmath97 systems , which are not true measurements of halo concentration but rather a failing of the entire fitting formula , and the @xmath99 system , which likely has a much lower mass than our haloes , we find that the observed and predicted distributions of @xmath43 are consistent at the 15%  level .",
    "+ this is a compelling result because it establishes the relation between a halo s concentration and its spin , and confirms the expectation that haloes with low @xmath43 and high @xmath54 are the natural hosts of lsb galaxies .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observational evidence , which indicates that lsb galaxies occupy dark matter haloes that are more diffuse and more extended than those of hsb galaxies of comparable mass @xcite . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , this is equivalent to stating that the host haloes of lsb galaxies are less centrally concentrated than those of their hsb counterparts .",
    "b01 observed and quantified a scatter in concentration for fixed halo mass , and found a 1-@xmath108 variation of @xmath109 ( although we note that this has been revised to @xmath110 ; bullock , private communication ) .",
    "thus we expect a galaxy halo with a virial mass @xmath111 to have a concentration in the range @xmath112 ( b01 , ens ) . however , previous studies failed to identify any correlation between a halo s concentration and its spin ; nfw examined the distribution of residuals in characteristic overdensity @xmath113 ( a function of the concentration ) and found no correlation with spin .",
    "similarly , @xcite found no evidence for a correlation between the spin parameter @xmath54 and concentration , although they noted a weak trend between their modified spin @xmath114 ( see equation  [ eq : lambdaprime ] ) and concentration @xmath2 , such that smaller @xmath2 corresponded to larger @xmath114 and vice versa .",
    "we suggest that the absence of a correlation in the @xcite data reflects the relatively poor mass resolution of their simulation in comparison with ours ( a factor of @xmath115 in mass ) , while we suspect that the selective nature and poor number statistics of the nfw study will have made the correlation difficult to identify .",
    "although this result does not resolve the current debate surrounding the mass profiles of lsb galaxy haloes and the implications for the cdm model , it is promising that a set of reasonable assumptions and a simple correlation between concentration and spin can so elegantly lead to two halo populations that bear the characteristics of lsb and hsb galaxies .",
    "the central density profiles of the haloes must still be reconciled with the detailed shapes of lsb rotation curves .",
    "one possibility is that an additional correlation exists , such that lsb galaxies occupy low-@xmath43 , high-@xmath54 and _ triaxial _ haloes , which may have observational consequences for the kind of rotation curves that we might observe ; indeed , the bearing of triaxiality on measured rotation curves has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , a subpopulation of our lsb host haloes have particularly triaxial figures .",
    "overall , we consider this an encouraging result for advocates of the cdm model and one worthy of further study .",
    "we warmly thank erwin de blok and eric hayashi for helpful correspondence . the financial support of the australian research council is gratefully acknowledged ."
