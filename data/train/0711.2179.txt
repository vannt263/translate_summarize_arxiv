    "this paper deals with the understanding of dynamics of systems capable of evolution .",
    "in particular we are interested in systems of technological evolution with biological evolution as a special case .",
    "we are dealing with systems of elements ( e.g. molecules , species , goods , thoughts ) that do not only exist or decay , but have the possibility to form new elements through recombination of already existing elements .",
    "for example consider a soup of molecules .",
    "some molecules in the soup can react chemically with each other and form new molecules .",
    "some reactions will lead to products that are already existing in the soup .",
    "other reactions may produce molecules that are new and therefore transform the soup - environment into something new .",
    "this in return opens the possibility for chemical reactions that have not been possible before the existence of the new product . in this context",
    "the concept of the _ adjacent possible_@xcite or _",
    "adjacent probable_@xcite has been introduced .",
    "this is the set of objects that can possibly become produced within a given time span into the future . what _ can _ be produced in the next timestep",
    "depends crucially on the details of the set of elements that exist at a given time .",
    "existing elements undergo an evaluation within the newly formed context@xcite .",
    "in this paper we are basically interested in three types of phenomena .",
    "first , cascades of creation , second , cascades of destruction .",
    "the existence of these kind of dynamics has been postulated in the schumpeterian view on economic evolution@xcite long time ago .",
    "third , we study _ formation _ processes in evolutionary dynamics . in this scenario elements exist in two different states 0/1 ( like existing / not existing , on / off , active / inactive ) .",
    "each element is connected to a set of other elements through a ( fixed ) interaction matrix .",
    "an element can change its state depending on the states of the elements it is connected to .",
    "for example , some type of molecule may change its state from non existing to existing when sufficiently many other molecules also exist  or vice versa .",
    "this problem can be cast onto an opinion formation@xcite scenario@xcite .",
    "one of the substantial problems in dealing with evolutionary systems is the notoriously high or even unbound dimensionality of systems undergoing evolution .",
    "just think of how many biological species exist on this planet or how many different goods and services are available , e.g. in europe .",
    "every element ( good / species / chemical substance ) @xmath0 is present in an evolving system with some relative frequency @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is the normalized abundance of the element @xmath0 , such that @xmath2 .",
    "think of each @xmath1 as an entry in a @xmath3-dimensional vector containing all possible elements in the universe .",
    "inter - dependence between pairs of elements can be coded in a large _ interaction matrix _ @xmath4 . if , for instance , @xmath0 uses a service provided by @xmath5 we set @xmath6 otherwise @xmath7 . for ternary ( and higher ) relations",
    "@xmath4 is not a matrix but a tensor which we call the _ production rule table _ or simply _",
    "rule table_. suppose we look at chemical reactions then @xmath8 when @xmath0 is the product of a chemical reaction of the substrates @xmath5 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 if this chemical process is not permitted by the rules of chemistry .",
    "high dimensionality usually makes such systems particularly difficult to treat in an analytic fashion . on the other hand the combinatorial explosion of elements that emerges through the recombinations of other elements , severely limits computational analysis as well .",
    "the exact way one element influences another is often only poorly known , or not known at all . for example , we do not exactly know how many biological species are living on this planet right now ( although we may make educated guesses ) .",
    "needless to say that we know even less about the actual interactions and relations that species involve in .",
    "consequently we usually can not exactly describe the inter - dependencies between species ( e.g. trophic dependencies ) which govern their dynamics .",
    "we are certainly incapable of prestating future inter - dependencies of species that might come into being in the future course of earth history .",
    "this is to say , that we usually know very little about the true structure of the interaction matrices or tensors @xmath4 .",
    "however , we may happen to know several things , constraining our ignorance .",
    "for example , we might have knowledge about the average number of chemical reactions producing the same chemical substance , or the average number of trophic dependencies an individual in an ecosystem is maintaining .",
    "it was suggested@xcite to meet the above problems of dimensionality and ignorance by two model assumptions : ( i ) the focus is shifted from the actual frequency of elements @xmath1 , to the system s diversity , where diversity is defined as the number of existing elements .",
    "an element exists , if @xmath11 , and does not exist if @xmath12 .",
    "( ii ) the entries of the interaction matrices or rule tables @xmath4 that encode the relation between the specific elements of the system , are modelled as random . for simplicity the entries of @xmath4",
    "are 0 or 1 .",
    "these two assumptions are powerful tools in mapping the dynamics  that ideally should be described on a level of differential equations of the relative frequencies ( concentrations ) of elements  onto recurrence relations for the system diversity or other variables of interest .    in the following we present two examples of how evolution dynamics can be treated methodologically in this manner . the first deals with cascades of creation and destruction in evolutionary systems .",
    "this is done in section [ cocd ] where we also show how to extend the analysis of earlier work@xcite .",
    "the second example deals with the formation process in section [ of ] .",
    "we have analyzed systems where pairs of elements exist that can be combined to form a third element@xcite .",
    "such systems are sometimes called catalytic networks .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of both creative and destructive cascades ( algorithmic phase transitions ) .",
    "we first review the results and then extend them to the situation where @xmath13 elements can be combined to form a product - element .",
    "note , that this model is a mathematically tractable variant of the so called bit - string model of biological evolution@xcite .",
    "suppose there is a maximal diversity of elements in the system @xmath3 that can possibly exist and write the relative frequencies @xmath1 ( how much there is of @xmath0 ) of the elements @xmath0 as the @xmath3 dimensional vector @xmath14 .",
    "this vector @xmath15 describes the state of the system .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath15 is governed by the famous _ catalytic network equation _ @xmath16 where the second term ensures normalization of @xmath15 .",
    "the tensor elements @xmath17 serve as the rule table , telling which combination of two elements @xmath5 and @xmath9 can produce a third ( new , different ) element @xmath0 .",
    "the rule table element @xmath17 is the rate at which element @xmath0 can get produced , given the elements @xmath5 and @xmath9 are abundant at their respective concentrations @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we call a pair of elements @xmath20 _ productive _ when there exists an @xmath0 such that @xmath21 is strictly larger than zero . special cases of eq.([model ] ) are the lotka volterra replicators@xcite , the hypercycle@xcite , or the turing gas@xcite . equation([model ] ) has been analyzed numerically@xcite , however for rather moderate system sizes .",
    "many goods and services require more than two inputs .",
    "for instance , a car - engine consists of many parts that have to be put together to form a functional entity , or the production of wine requires barrels , grapes , bottles , human labor and appropriate quantities of sun and rain . therefore we generalize the catalytic network equation to processes , where @xmath13 elements instead of two elements are necessary to form a new one . to do so",
    ", we have to pass from considering index pairs @xmath20 like in eq.([model ] ) , to @xmath13 dimensional index vectors @xmath22 to indicate the necessary @xmath13 substrate elements .",
    "therefore the rule table becomes a tensor @xmath23 depending on the product @xmath0 and @xmath13 substrate - elements @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . to model the effect of the availability of elements on the production we also have to pass from the frequency pair @xmath26 in eq.([model ] ) , to the product of the @xmath13 frequencies @xmath27 .",
    "the notion of the productive pair naturally extends to the notion of _ productive sets _ such that a set of elements @xmath28 is productive when there exists an @xmath0 such that @xmath29 . replacing this appropriately into eq.([model ] ) gives us the _ generalized catalytic network equation_. remarkably , this generalization does not alter the arguments that allow us to analyze the creative and destructive cascades of production we are interested in .",
    "first of all , applying ( i ) from the previous section , we reduce the dimensionality of the problem by counting the elements @xmath11 , and define the relative diversity @xmath30 $ ] of the system such that @xmath31 is the number of existing elements at time @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the system has a growing mode only ( tensor elements @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 but never negative ) .",
    "entries @xmath35 in the _ rule - table _ tensor @xmath4 indicate the _ productive sets_. suppose , applying ( ii ) , we only know the number @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is the number of such productive sets occurring in the system and that the entries @xmath35 and @xmath38 in @xmath4 are distributed completely randomly . @xmath36 constitutes our constraining knowledge on @xmath4 .",
    "the only variables characterizing our system therefore are @xmath36 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us suppose  as the initial condition  that initially , at time @xmath39 , only a few elements @xmath40 exist .",
    "this means that @xmath41 elements in the initial element vector are different from zero .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic value ( @xmath42 ) of the relative diversity @xmath43 .",
    "the fraction of sets of @xmath13 elements in the system which are productive is given by @xmath37 divided by the binomial coefficient of @xmath3 over @xmath13 elements @xmath44 . in a given set of size @xmath45",
    "there are @xmath46 sets consisting of @xmath13 elements to be found on average .",
    "due to the assumed randomness of the distribution of productive sets of elements the number of produced elements is @xmath47 yet , about @xmath48 of those elements already have been produced in the preceding time step @xmath49 and are certainly contained in @xmath50 already .",
    "they consequently have to be subtracted as already existing .",
    "due to the randomness of the production of elements only a fraction @xmath51 of the remaining elements will not be present in @xmath50 and truly be newly created .",
    "putting all this together yields @xmath52 at timestep @xmath39 we have to set @xmath53 , by convention since @xmath54 is the initial condition .",
    "these equations are exactly solvable in the long - time limit . for this end",
    "define , @xmath55 , and look at the asymptotic behavior , @xmath56 . from eq .",
    "( [ update ] ) we get @xmath57 on the other hand we can estimate @xmath43 asymptotically by @xmath58 by inserting eq.([ansatz_a ] ) into eq.([ansatz_b ] ) one gets a @xmath59th order equation @xmath60 whose solutions are the solution to the problem . most remarkably these solutions are mathematically identical to the description of real gases , i.e. van der waals gases , independent of the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "one can make the relation to the van der waals gas explicit by defining , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "this allows to generically map eq.([asymptotic_phase_equ ] ) onto the famous equation @xmath64 which is exactly a van der waals gas of point - particles with constant internal pressure .",
    "the meaning of pressure and temperature in our context is intuitively clear . as comparable to real gases",
    "our @xmath13-ary assembly system shows a phase transition phenomenon which are of the same universality class independent of the choice of @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram , as a function of the model parameter @xmath36 and the initial condition @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the choice @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "note that assembly systems with larger values of @xmath13 undergo the phase transition at larger values of @xmath54 for fixed @xmath36 so that larger sets of random entities are required to trigger self - sustaining creative cascades .",
    "the update - equations ( [ update ] ) are scale invariant .",
    "the solutions of the problem in terms of relative diversities do not explicitly depend on the upper bound of diversity @xmath3 and the results therefore apply also in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "one can think of open systems which can not be described as a limit of bounded systems .",
    "such systems can be treated in a similar fashion , however this task is of considerably higher mathematical complexity .",
    "work dealing with this problem is in preparation .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the dynamics of the system is shown in the phase diagram , fig.[phase ] .",
    "it illustrates the size of the respective regimes and their dependence on the parameters @xmath68 and connectedness @xmath69 .    for the voter - model it is known that the system will always end up in a consensus state .",
    "in contrast to this we also find stable solutions for coexistence .",
    "this sheds some light on the question of which parameters are controlling whether a collective decision - making process ends in consens ( like in the vhs - betamax example ) or in a coexistence ( e.g. the mac and windows users ) .",
    "this is possible due to two ingredients in the model presented here .",
    "first , our updates are carried out random sequentially . as a consequence",
    "the distribution of opinions among the nodes does not stay maximally random ( w.r.t .",
    "initial conditions ) and groups of agents sharing the same opinion appear .",
    "second , the threshold @xmath70 can also be viewed as a level of tolerance in the sense of allowing a node to maintain its internal state even though a majority of the neighbors thinks different .",
    "common ground in systems capable of evolution is that for the production of new species / goods / ideas etc . the existence of specific other items is a necessary precondition . in this context",
    "( auto)catalytic systems has become a cornerstone in understanding evolutionary processes in various fields .",
    "notoriously high dimensionality of problems and poor knowledge on the exact form of interactions governing such systems complicate the situation .",
    "we have shown in previous work how reducing the description of dynamics from the detailed level of the frequency of elements to the level of system diversity and how modeling interactions as random ( when no better knowledge is available ) paves a path towards the analytic treatability of systems of evolution .",
    "we present two examples to make clear the power of the arguments and the wide applicability of the method .",
    "first , we applied the philosophy to massive events of creation and destruction in technological and biological networks .",
    "here we extended and generalized earlier results on catalytic systems .",
    "we find cascading events .",
    "generalized catalytic systems can pass from low but critically large initial diversity to high diversity and they can break down from high to low diversity at a critical point of primary defects ( removal of elements ) .",
    "the existence of this kind of phenomena in evolution is long known@xcite in biology ( e.g. the cambrian explosion ) and has been formulated in heuristic and qualitative terms in the economical context by j.a . schumpeter . with our work",
    "we increase our ability to describe his creative gales of destruction in a more quantitative framework .",
    "further we show that the new methodology allows to mathematically treat a variant of the threshold voter - model of opinion formation on random graphs . for fixed topology",
    ", we find distinct phases of mixed opinions and consensus . stated in terms of systems of evolution",
    "the phases of consensus correspond to the phases of maximal and minimal diversity where either ( almost ) nothing or ( almost ) everything possible exists .",
    "the stable mixed opinions correspond to a phase where only a fraction of what possibly can be produced , exists in a stable way .",
    "whereas for the voter dynamics it is known that it always leads to a consensus state ( i.e. only everything / nothing or one of two opinions / states ) , the model studied here allows the coexistence of two states .",
