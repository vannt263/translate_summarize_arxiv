    "so far , the neutron stars ( ns ) have been considered as a rich laboratory of various superfluid phases of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "recently the interest has been focussed on the ns interior , where both the vortex pinning responsible for the observed period glitches@xcite and the nucleon superfluidity responsible for the main cooling mechanisms @xcite are supposed to be located .",
    "in particular the recent observations of cooling in the ns of cassiopeia a have been considered to be a direct evidence of the @xmath0 pairing in ns core , and the energy gap needed to explain the data has been estimated to be around @xmath1 mev@xcite . from the theoretical viewpoint , the onset of the @xmath0 superfluid state occurs in regions above the saturation density .",
    "this event rises the problem of the pairing formation in high density nuclear matter , that however all previous calculations neglect ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the density region , where the @xmath0 component of the nuclear interaction is the most attractive , may extend to several times the saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "in such a high - density regime , the short - range correlations are so strong that the momentum distribution around the fermi level departs significantly from the typical profile of a degenerate fermi system .",
    "this departure is measured by the so - called @xmath2-factor @xmath3 @xcite . since the deformation of the fermi surface hinders particle transitions around the fermi energy @xmath4",
    ", the pairing gap is expected to get reduced in any case , even for the low density @xmath5 pairing channel ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . concerning the high - density neutron - neutron pairing in the @xmath0 channel , the calculations so far reported in the literature ignore the effect of the @xmath2-factor , owing to the large uncertainty still existing in the magnitude of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interaction in the @xmath0 channel , including both the two body force ( 2bf ) and the three - body force ( 3bf ) component .",
    "other many - body effects , such as screening effect , have been neglected for the same reason .    in this note",
    ", we present a study of the @xmath2-factor effect on the @xmath0 pairing in pure neutron matter . in principle",
    ", we should consider asymmetric nuclear matter for application to ns core , but the small proton fraction is not relevant in this context , as discussed below .",
    "the deformation of the fermi surface and the @xmath2-factor are studied in the framework of the brueckner theory with 2bf and 3bf @xcite .",
    "the energy gap is then calculated within the generalized bcs theory @xcite , including in the pairing interaction not only 2bf , but also 3bf .",
    "the latter , in fact , is dominant at high density and therefore it is expected to directly influence pairing gap in addition to the z - factor .",
    "the neutron green s function is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the fermi energy and @xmath9 the self - energy .",
    "expanding the latter in a series of powers of the quasiparticle energy around the fermi surface , we obtain @xmath10 where the quasi - particle energy and the quasi - particle strength are @xmath11_{\\omega=\\epsilon_p}^{-1 } , % z_{\\tau}(p ) = % ( 1-\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{\\tau}(p,\\omega)}{\\partial\\omega})_{\\omega=\\epsilon_p}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . the quasiparticle strength @xmath12 measures the deviation of a correlated fermi system from the ideal degenerate fermi gas .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath13 and the @xmath12 factors have been calculated in the framework of the brueckner theory @xcite .",
    "grace to the inclusion of the three body forces the hole - line expansion can be extended up to high densities . the self - energy , truncated to the second order ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , provides us with a good reproduction of the empirical nuclear mean field @xcite and the optical - model potential @xcite , so that we are quite confident that the next orders are irrelevant for the present calculation .",
    "we employ as 2bf the meson exchange bonn b potential @xcite , whose meson parameters are constrained by the fit with the experimental phase shifts of nn scattering .",
    "the microscopic meson exchange 3bf is the one constructed by li _",
    "it is consistent with the 2bf because it adopts the same meson parameters as bonn b , so that there are no free parameters in the model .",
    "the @xmath12 factor is related to the depletion of the occupation number @xmath13 around the fermi surface .",
    "according to the migdal - luttinger theorem @xcite its value @xmath14(z - factor ) equals the discontinuity of the occupation number at the fermi surface , i.e. , @xmath15 = z(p^f ) , % n_{\\tau}(p^f_{\\tau}-\\varepsilon)-n_{\\tau}(p^f_{\\tau}+\\varepsilon ) = % z_{\\tau}(p^f_{\\tau}).\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the fermi momentum . in our approximation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 determines the left limit and @xmath19 the right limit of the preceding equation for @xmath20 .",
    "-factors vs. density ( lower panel ) in pure neutron matter .",
    "the effect of 3bf is shown in both panels . in the lower panel",
    "the calculations are reported for two approximations of the self - energy ]    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we display the calculated occupation probability in pure neutron matter at density @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "one easily observes the remarkable deviation from the ideal fermi gas ( solid line ) due to the strong short - range correlations .",
    "as expected , the deviation is slightly enhanced by 3bf . in fig .",
    "1(b ) the calculated @xmath2-factor is displayed vs.density in the two different approximations for the self - energy , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the calculation of @xmath25 from eq.(3 ) requires a high numerical accuracy : increasing the accuracy the calculated @xmath25 gets lower and lower until the converging value is reached .",
    "it is noticed that without 3bf , the @xmath2-factors decrease slowly as a function of density . adding the contribution of @xmath26 leads to an overall reduction of the @xmath2 factor .",
    "the 3bf reduces further the @xmath2-factor and its effect increases rapidly with density . as a consequence , including 3bf makes the decrease of the @xmath2-factor as a function of density much rapid than that obtained by adopting pure 2bf . therefore 3bf induces a strong extra deviation from the ideal fermi gas model .",
    "the @xmath0 superfluidity in pure neutron matter has been investigated by using various theoretical approaches @xcite with 2bf , and later extended to microscopic 3bf forces by zuo _",
    "et al . _ @xcite . in this case , the pairing gaps are determined by the two coupled equations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 are the matrix elements of the realistic @xmath6 interaction in the coupled @xmath0 channel . in the gap equation ,",
    "the @xmath2-factors and the single - particle energy @xmath31 are calculated from the brueckner theory . as for the pairing interaction @xmath30 in the @xmath0 coupled channel , we adopt the same 2bf and 3bf as in the brueckner calculation . the 3bf can not be neglected in the gap calculation because the @xmath0 pairing is expected to occur in the high density domain , where 3bf is quite sizeable specially in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.2 . neglecting the z - factor effect ( upper panel ) ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath0 gap with the new interaction dos not differ from previous calculations with av18 potential @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3bf enhances the @xmath0 superfluidity significantly at higher densities .",
    "but , as shown in the lower panel of fig.2 , the introduction of the @xmath2-factor effect fatally quenches the pairing gaps to a value less 0.05 mev , one order of magnitude smaller than the value with full interaction . the effect of the @xmath2-factor appears to be extremely sizeable at high densities .",
    "it is worth noticing that this effect is opposite to the 3bf effect on the @xmath0 pairing in neutron matter : the former turns out to be much stronger than the latter . in conclusion",
    ", the departure of the system from the pure degenerate limit drives the pairing attenuation at high density , regardless of whether the 3bf is included or not .",
    "pairing gap in pure neutron matter .",
    "notice the y - scale change from ( a ) to ( b ) ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the @xmath2-factor was investigated also for the @xmath5 pairing in neutron matter , and it was shown to reduce the energy gap .",
    "comparing with the results of ref.@xcite , the same effect on the @xmath0 superfluidity appears to be much stronger .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that in the density region of the @xmath0 superfluidity the deviation of neutron matter from the degenerate fermi gas limit becomes much larger .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the anisotropic @xmath0 pairing in pure neutron matter .",
    "the effects of the fermi surface depletion ( z - factor ) have been included in the calculation of the energy gap . in the pure degenerate limit",
    ", the @xmath0 superfluid phase extends over a broad density range with a gap peak value of about 0.2 mev without 3bf and 0.5 mev with 3bf .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath2-factor leads to a rapid decrease of the gap magnitude by one order of magnitude : its peak value drops to less than 0.05 mev and the superfluidity domain shrinks to @xmath32 @xmath22 . in neutron",
    "stars the proton fraction in @xmath33-equilibrium with neutrons could in principle affect the @xmath0 pairing , but in the non - vanishing gap range it is less than @xmath34 of the total density .",
    "recent calculations on the isospin dependence of the quasi - particle strength show that the enhancement of the neutron @xmath2-factor is negligible for such small proton fraction @xcite . even including the additional screening suppression @xcite",
    ", the conclusion remains that the departure from the fermi gas limit is the main cause of pairing disappearance in high - density nuclear matter .",
    "this result makes doubtful the role of the @xmath0 pairing in ns core .",
