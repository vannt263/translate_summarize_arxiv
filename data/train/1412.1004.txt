    "now , add bars between pairs of these points ; a bar fixes the length between the two end - points .",
    "the points and bars form a _",
    "framework_. a framework is said to be rigid if it can not be deformed ( but can possibly be translated and rotated on the plane ) ; equivalently , it is rigid if the distance between any pair of points , connected by a bar or not , is fixed .",
    "characterizing the rigidity of a framework is very difficult in general . in the absence of sliders ,",
    "a celebrated theorem by laman  @xcite ensures that for a generic framework , its rigidity properties only depend on its underlying graph , where points are vertices and bars are edges : the geometry does not enter .",
    "this theorem has been generalized to frameworks with sliders in  @xcite . in the whole article",

    "type 2 _ ) if it is ( resp . is not ) connected to a slider .",
    "consider now a percolation setting : take a set of @xmath9 vertices , a fraction @xmath0 of which are type 2 , and add edges randomly .",
    "the questions are : when does a giant ( that is : including a positive fraction of the vertices ) rigid structure emerge ?",
    "what is its size ?",
    "when edges are sampled independently at random between pairs of vertices , the resulting graph is an erds - rnyi random graph @xmath10 . in this case and for @xmath11 ( no slider ) , kasiviswanathan et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the threshold for a giant rigid component is @xmath12 , and that the transition is discontinuous : as soon as the giant rigid component appears , it already includes a positive fraction of all @xmath9 vertices .",
    "this recovers numerical and heuristic results found earlier in the physics literature @xcite , and contrasts with the emergence of a giant connected component at @xmath13 , which is continuous .",
    "indeed when @xmath14 , we will see that rigidity is closely related to the emergence of the giant connected component .",
    "our goal is to investigate the case where @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "we are thus interested in situations interpolating between standard connectivity percolation and rigidity percolation as studied in @xcite .",
    "we obtain the following results :    * we compute the threshold for rigidity percolation as a function of @xmath0 * we show that the transition is continuous for @xmath3 and discontinuous for @xmath16 , thus uncovering what is called a `` tricritical '' point in statistical mechanics , for @xmath17 * on the way , we obtain new results on cores for erds - rnyi random graphs and their generalization to two types of vertices .",
    "we prove in particular a conjecture on the size of the @xmath8-core in  @xcite    rigidity percolation has physical motivations : it is a model to understand some properties of network glasses and proteins @xcite .",

    "we have already cited investigations on random graphs starting with @xcite , with only one type of vertex ( type 2 , or more generally type @xmath18 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "moukarzel heuristically studies a model with two types of vertices : a fraction of the vertices are pinned to the plane , instead of being allowed to move in one direction ; they could be called `` type 0 '' vertices . in this case , the transition disappears when the fraction of pinned vertices increases : there is no tricritical point , but rather a critical point . in order to compute the threshold for rigidity , we use the same connection as  @xcite between orientability and rigidity .",
    "we then use recently introduced and powerful methods to compute the orientability threshold @xcite . to investigate the continuous or discontinuous character of the transition , we rely on various refinements of a method introduced in  @xcite to investigate the cores of a random graph . in section",
