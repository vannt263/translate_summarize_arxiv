    "increasingly often , researchers are confronted with monitoring the states of nodes in large computer , social , or power networks where these states dynamically change due to viruses , rumors , or failures that propagate according to the graph topology @xcite . this class of network dynamics has been extensively modeled as a percolation phenomenon , where nodes on a graph can randomly `` infect '' their neighbors .",
    "percolation across networks has a rich history in the field of statistical physics , computer science , and mathematical epidemiology . here",
    ", researchers are typically confronted with a network , or a distribution over the network topology , and extract fixed point attractors of node configurations , thresholds for phase transitions in node states , or distributions of node state configurations @xcite . in the field of fault detection , the nodes or edges can `` fail '' , and the goal is to activate a subset of sensors in the network which yield high quality measurements that identify these failures @xcite . while the former field of research concerns itself with extracting _",
    "offline _ statistics about properties of the percolation phenomenon on networks , devoid of any measurements , the latter field addresses _ online _ measurement selection tasks .    here",
    ", we propose a methodology that actively tracks a causal markov process across a complex network ( such as the one in figure [ sf ] ) , where measurements are adaptively selected .",
    "we extract conditions such that the updated posterior probability of all nodes `` infected '' is driven to one in the limit of large observation time .",
    "in other words , we derive conditions for the existence of an epidemic threshold on the updated posterior distribution over the states .    the proposed percolation threshold should more accurately reflect the true conditions that cause a phase transition in a network , e.g. , node status changing from healthy / normal to infected / failed , than traditional thresholds derived from conditions on predictive distributions which are devoid of observations or controls .    since most practical networks of interest are large , such as electrical grids , it is usually infeasible to sample all nodes continuously , as such measurements are either expensive or bandwidth is limited . given these , or other resource constraints",
    ", we present an information theoretic sampling strategy that selectively targets specific nodes that will yield the largest information gain , and thus , better detection performance .    the proposed sampling strategy balances the trade - off between trusting the _ predictions _ from the known model dynamics ( from percolation theory ) and expending precious resources to select a set of nodes for measurement .    we present the adaptive measurement selection problem and give two tractable approximations to this subset selection problem based upon the joint and marginal posterior distribution , respectively .",
    "a set of decomposable bayesian filtering equations are presented for this adaptive sampling framework and the necessary tractable inference algorithms for complex networks are discussed .",
    "we present analytical worst case performance bounds for our adaptive sampling performance , which can serve as sampling heuristics for the activation of sensors or trusting predictions generated from previous measurements .    to the author s knowledge ,",
    "this is the first attempt to extract a percolation threshold of an actively monitored network using the updated posterior distribution instead of the observation independent predictive distributions .",
    "the objective of actively monitoring the @xmath0 node network is to recursively update the posterior distribution of each hidden node state given various measurements .",
    "specifically , the next set of @xmath1 measurement actions ( nodes to sample ) , @xmath2 , at next discrete time are chosen such that they yield the highest quality of _ information _ about the @xmath0 hidden states .",
    "the condition on @xmath3 simulates the reality of fixed resource constraints , where typically only a small subset of nodes in a large network can be observed at any one time .    here , the hidden states are discrete random variables that correspond to the states encoded by the percolation process on the graph . here , the graph @xmath4 , with @xmath5 representing the set of nodes and @xmath6 corresponding to the set of edges .",
    "formally , we will assume a state - space representation of a discrete time , finite state , partially observed markov decision process ( pomdp ) .",
    "here , @xmath7 represents the joint hidden states , e.g. , healthy or infected @xmath8 represents the @xmath1 observed measurements obtained at time @xmath9 , e.g. , biological assays or pinging an ip address , and @xmath10 represents the @xmath1 actions taken at time @xmath9 , i.e. , which nodes to sample . here ,",

    "since the topology of @xmath16 encodes the direction of `` flow '' for the process , the state equations may be modeled as a decomposable partially observed markov process : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the neighborhood of @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a non - random vector - valued function , @xmath21 is measurement noise , and @xmath22 is a stochastic equation encoding the transition dynamics of the markov process ( see figure [ 2tbn ] for a two node graphical model representation ) .     and @xmath23 for @xmath24,width=168 ]      in our proposed framework for actively monitoring the hidden node states in the network , the posterior distribution is the sufficient statistic for inferring these states .",
    "the general recursion for updating the joint posterior probability given all past and present observations is given by the standard bayes update formula : @xmath25 with @xmath26 the chapman - kolmogorov equations provide the connection between the posterior update ( [ intract ] ) and the distribution resulting from the standard percolation equations .",
    "in the former , the updates are conditional probabilities that are conditional on past observations , while in the latter , the updates are not dependent on observations .",
    "the local interactions in the graph @xmath16 imply the following conditional independence assumptions : @xmath27 @xmath28 where the likelihood term is defined in ( [ y ] ) and the transition dynamics are defined in ( [ z ] ) .",
    "this decomposable structure allows the belief state ( posterior excluding time @xmath9 observations ) update , for the @xmath29 node in @xmath16 , to be written as : @xmath30 with the parent set , @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , for highly connected nodes in @xmath16 , this marginal update becomes intractable .",
    "it thus must be approximated @xcite .      in most real world situations ,",
    "acquiring measurements from all @xmath0 nodes at any time @xmath9 is unrealistic , and thus , a sampling policy must be exploited for measuring a subset of nodes @xcite . since we are concerned with monitoring the states of the nodes in the network , an appropriate reward is the expected information gain between the _ updated _ posterior , @xmath32 , and the belief state , @xmath33 : @xmath34\\ ] ] @xmath35 with @xmath36-divergence @xmath37    \\right)\\ ] ] for distributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 with identical support .    the reward in ( [ ig ] ) has been widely applied to multi - target , multi - sensor tracking for many problems including , sensor management and surveillance @xcite .",

    "the expectation in ( [ ig ] ) is taken with respect to the conditional distribution @xmath42 given the previous measurements @xmath43 and actions @xmath44 . in practice , the expected information divergence in ( [ ig ] ) must be evaluated via monte - carlo methods .",
    "also , the maximization in ( [ ig ] ) requires enumeration over all @xmath45 actions ( for subsets of size @xmath1 ) , and therefore , we must resort to greedy approximations .",
    "we propose incrementally constructing the set of actions at time @xmath9 , @xmath44 , for @xmath46 , according to : @xmath47.\\ ] ] both ( [ ig ] ) and ( [ approxig ] ) are selecting the nodes to sample which yield maximal divergence between the percolation prediction distribution ( belief state ) and the updated posterior distribution , averaged over all possible observations .",
    "thus ( [ ig ] ) provides a metric to assess whether to trust the predictor and defer actions until a future time or choose to take action , sample a node , and update the posterior .      since the expected @xmath36-divergence in ( [ ig ] )",
    "is not closed form , we could resort to numerical methods for estimating this quantity .",
    "alternatively , one could specify an analytical lower - bound that could be used in - lieu of numerically computing the expected information gain in ( [ ig ] ) or ( [ approxig ] ) .",
    "we begin by noting that the expected divergence between the updated posterior and the predictive distribution ( conditioned on previous observations ) differ only through the measurement update factor , @xmath48 ( ( [ ig ] ) re - written ) :    @xmath49 \\nonumber\\\\   = \\mathbb{e}_{g_{k|k-1 } } \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1 } \\mbox{log } \\",
