    "consistent quantum theory with unitary time evolution and probabilistic interpretation for certain classes of non - hermitian systems have been the subject of intrinsic research in frontier physics over the last one and half decade @xcite .",
    "the huge success of complex quantum theory @xcite has lead to its extension to many other branches of physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , its application to quantum optics is the most noticable , where break down of pt - symmetry has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "more recently , this formulation has been extended to classical systems @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are two completely different theories and provide profoundly dissimilar description of physical systems . however , bohr s correspondence principle states that quantum particles behave like classical ones when the quantum number is very high . keeping this in mind",
    ", classical systems have been investigated in a complex plane .",
    "correspondence between quantum and classical systems becomes more pronounced in the complex domain @xcite .",
    "remarkably , a particle with complex energy exhibits tunneling like behavior which is usually realized in the quantum domain .",
    "this tunneling behavior of a classical particle with complex energy is well demonstrated in ref .",
    "they have shown that a classical particle can tunnel from one classically allowed region to another allowed region separated by a classically forbidden path .",
    "several other works in this field are devoted to study the nature of the trajectory of a classical particle with complex energy @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to study the effect of spontaneous pt - symmetry breaking in the particle trajectories of analogous complex classical models .",
    "however the study of complex classical system is only restricted to a few models .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to extend these works further to investigate the different behaviors of a complex classical system .",
    "we have chosen a complex classical system corresponding to a qes @xcite , non - hermitian pt - symmetric system @xcite described by the potential @xmath0 .",
    "we numerically study the dynamics of a classical particle moving in the complex xy - plane subjected to this potential which consists of periodic wells situated to the left and right side of the imaginary axis to demonstrate the quantum tunneling effect and the trajectory of the particle in different situations . for real energy ,",
    "the particle makes closed orbits around one of the wells depending on the initial condition .",
    "however , surprisingly the particle can have open orbits even with real energy if it is initially placed in a certain region between the two wells on the same side of the imaginary axis . on the other hand when the particle energy is complex , the trajectory is open and the particle tunnels back and forth between two wells which are separated by a classically forbidden path . in all the situations the particle trajectory never crosses itself . at the classical level , unlike the analogous quantum situation , we do not see any qualitative differences in the features of the particle dynamics for @xmath1-even ( pt symmetry broken phase ) and @xmath1-odd ( pt symmetry unbroken phase ) .",
    "the tunneling time is calculated for different pairs of wells and is shown to vary inversely with the imaginary component of energy , similar to a situation which is usually valid in the quantum domain .",
    "now , we state the plan of the paper .",
    "the qes potential and its solutions for broken and unbroken pt symmetry cases are reviewed in sec.ii .",
    "we discuss the classical mechanics of this potential in a complex plane and obtain the trajectories of the classical particle in different situations in sec.iii .",
    "variation of tunneling time with imaginary part of the energy of the particle is discussed in sec.iv , and section v is kept for conclusions .",

    "parity transformation in this particular system is taken in the general form as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "this system is shown to be a qes system .",
    "the first @xmath1 energy levels along with the corresponding eigenfunctions are calculated exactly for any specific integer value of @xmath1 .",
    "further more , this qes system shows another remarkable property relevant to pt symmetric non - hermitian system , i.e. for even values of @xmath1 , all the eigenvalues are complex for any arbitrary value of @xmath3 . on the other hand , for odd @xmath1 ,",
    "all the eigenvalues are real if @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , system is always in broken pt phase for even values of @xmath1 , and shows pt phase transition when @xmath1 is odd .",
    "the energy eigenvalues for this system is calculated using bender - dunne ( bd ) polynomial methods @xcite .",
    "the zeros of bd polynomials give the energy eigenvalues for the qes system .",
    "some of the low lying levels are listed as follows .",

    "<S> we consider a parity - time ( pt ) invariant non - hermitian quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) potential which exhibits pt phase transition . </S>",

    "<S> the particle with real energy makes closed orbits around one of the periodic wells of the complex potential depending on the initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> however interestingly the particle can have open orbits even with real energy if it is initially placed in certain region between the two wells on the same side of the imaginary axis . on the other hand when the particle energy is complex </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory is open and the particle tunnels back and forth between two wells which are separated by a classically forbidden path . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling time is calculated for different pair of wells and is shown to vary inversely with the imaginary component of energy . at the classical level unlike the analogous quantum situation </S>",
