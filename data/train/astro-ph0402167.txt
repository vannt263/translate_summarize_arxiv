    "we have taken deep , high dynamic range images of most stars in the tw hydra , horologium , tucana and @xmath4 pic groups ( age=10 .. 40gyrs , d=10 .. 60pc ) .",
    "such young nearby stars are well suited for direct imaging of substellar companions , both brown dwarfs and massive planets ( neuhuser et al . , 2003[1 ] ) .",
    "the target stars are located in young star forming regions , hence companions are young and therefore still self - luminous . due to the proximity of the target",
    "stars a high spatial resolution can be achieved .",
    "we started our search by using seeing limited imaging with sofi and speckle technique with the mpe speckle camera sharp , both at the eso 3.5 m ntt on la silla .",
    "companion candidates detected in 1@xmath0 epoch images must be confirmed by 2@xmath2 epoch images ( proper motion ) and follow - up spectra , in the latter case done with isaac at the vlt . from non - detection and detection limits , we could conclude that massive planets ( m@xmath55@xmath3 ) in wide orbits ( a@xmath550au ) are rare and appear around less than 9% of the stars .",
    "finally our results have shown that the detection of extrasolar planets around young nearby stars was indeed already possible without ao , i.e. with sharp at the 3.5mntt , but only at large separation outside 50au .",
    "only a few months ago we have started a deep high dynamic range survey for very close planetary companions using naos - conica ( naco ) at the vlt .",
    "our survey is additional to other direct search programs because the targets in our program are unpublished ( to be young ) hence most likely not observed by other groups already searching for planets .",
    "we started our observations ( 1@xmath0 epoch ) in may 2003 and continued it in sep .",
    "many stars were observed and several companion candidates were detected only few arcsecs separated from the target stars .",
    "epoch psf subtracted naco image of the young nearby star hd180617 . the fov is 13.6x13.6arcsecs .",
    "the input seeing was about 0.9 arcsecs .",
    "many faint companion candidates are detected in k@xmath6 .",
    "they are marked with small white boxes .",
    "the closest two objects ( a , b ) are also shown in the dynamic range plot , in fig.2.,scaledwidth=69.0% ]    we use a pixelscale of 13.25mas which gives us a good sampling of the vlt psf and provide concurrently the highest spatial resolution achievable with naco .",
    "a short individual integration time ( 0.347s ) is used to avoid saturation as well as possible .",
    "that s why we have to superimpose many of those short integrated frames to obtain deep infrared images .",
    "fig.1 shows a naco image of hd180617 , one target star which we could observe twice in 1@xmath0 and in 2@xmath2 epoch .",
    "we have subtracted the stellar psf to measure astrometry and photometry of all detected faint companion candidates . in fig.2 (",
    "left ) the measured dynamic range for this image is shown . if bound all detected objects should have planetary masses ( m@xmath113@xmath3 ) assuming a conservative age of 100myrs and using models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003)[2 ] .",
    "this analysis shows clearly that the detection of planetary companions inside a saturn - orbit ( 10au ) is possible .",
    "after psf subtraction gaint planets down to jupiter - orbits ( 5au ) come into range . in the given epoch difference of 4 months we could measure the spatial motion of all detected objects including the bright primary .",
    "the detected companion candidates are clearly not co - moving , hence they are not real companions of hd180617 . nevertheless those data can be used to measure the proper and parallactic motion of hd180617 . detected background stars are used as reference points for relative astrometry .",
    "the parallax has a large stake in the entire motion of the star ( see dashed and solid lines ) .",
    "the stellar motion in the given time span is more than 100 times larger than the astrometric uncertainties obtained with naco .",
    "this illustrates well that few weeks of epoch difference are enough to find faint co - moving companions , hence the detection of co - moving companions is possible in only one observing period with naos - conica if the proper motion is large enough .",
