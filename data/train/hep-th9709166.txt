    "as field modes emerge from the vicinity of the horizon they are infinitely redshifted . in ordinary field theory there is an infinite density of states at the horizon to supply the outgoing modes .",
    "how do these outgoing modes arise if the short distance physics supports no infinite density of states ? and how does the short distance physics affect the hawking radiation in these modes ? by insisting on a fully sensible resolution of the apparent conflict between black holes and short distance finiteness we hope that some deep lessons can be learned .",
    "that is the underlying motivation for the present work .",
    "one way to avoid an infinite density of states is to have some physical cutoff at short distances , related to a fundamental graininess of spacetime .",
    "analogies with condensed matter systems such as fluids , crystals , fermi liquids , etc . suggest that in this case the long wavelength collective modes which are described by field theory will propagate with a dispersion relation that deviates from the linear , lorentz - invariant form at high frequencies .",
    "a number of ( two dimensional ) linear field theory models with such behavior have now been studied@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the hawking radiation is extremely insensitive to the short distance physics , as long as neither the black hole temperature nor the frequency at which the spectrum is examined is too close to the scale of the new physics .",
    "what is striking is that this is so even though the behavior of the field modes is rather bizarre : the outgoing modes that carry the hawking radiation arise from exotic ingoing modes that bounce off the horizon .",
    "although these models do provide a mechanism for generating the outgoing modes without an infinite density of states at the horizon , they still behave unphysically : wavepackets can not be propagated backwards in time all the way out to  infinity \" ( i.e. the asymptotic region far from the black hole ) . for example , using unruh s dispersion relation@xcite , which has a group velocity that drops monotonically to zero at infinite wavevector , the wavevector diverges as the wavepacket goes ( backwards in time ) farther from the black hole .",
    "so , in this case , the infinite redshift is just moved to a new location .",
    "evidently the theory is pushed into the trans - planckian regime after all . to make sense of  or at least to sensibly model  the true origin of the outgoing modes , it therefore seems necessary to work with a theory that has a well - behaved physical cutoff . a simple way to implement such",
    "a cutoff is to discretize space , and work with a lattice theory preserving continuity in time .",
    "this is roughly similar to what is happening in a condensed matter system , but we can preserve strict linearity for the lattice field theory and still model the key effect of the cutoff .",
    "in this paper we study two lattice models of this nature obtained by discretizing the spatial coordinate in a freely falling coordinate system .",
    "( if instead a static coordinate is discretized then the lattice points have diverging acceleration as the horizon is approached , and their worldlines are spacelike inside the horizon .",
    "this leads to pathological behavior of the field . )",
    "if there really is a cutoff in some preferred frame , then that frame should presumably fall from the  cosmic \" rest frame at infinity in towards a black hole .",
    "this would be like unruh s sonic analog of a black hole @xcite or the helium-3 texture analog @xcite , where the short distance cutoff is provided by the atomic structure of the fluid which is freely flowing across the phonon or other quasiparticle horizon .",
    "one particular choice of discretization has the feature that a discrete remnant of time translation invariance survives .",
    "this makes the model easier to study analytically , and we exploit this to show here in sections [ falling][hrad ] that in a leading approximation the black hole radiates thermally at the hawking temperature .",
    "the same result was found previously by unruh @xcite using numerical evolution of the lattice field equation .",
    "unfortunately , however , this particular lattice model is still not satisfactory as a model of physics with a fundamental cutoff , because the proper lattice spacing goes to zero at infinity !",
    "it is easy to avoid the vanishing lattice spacing by discretizing instead a spatial coordinate which measures proper length on some initial spacelike surface all the way out to infinity .",
    "however , since we also want the lattice points to fall freely into the black hole , this results in a lattice spacing that grows in time , as shown in section [ evasion ] .",
    "the growth of the lattice spacing suggests that we have still not found a satisfactory model with a short distance cutoff .",
    "( an alternative which avoids this problem will be discussed at the end of this paper . )",
    "however , it is rather instructive to understand the physics of this model with the growing lattice spacing . in this model time translation symmetry",
    "is violated for short wavelength modes but not for long wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the killing energy of an outgoing mode can be much lower than that of the ingoing mode that gave rise to it .",
    "this is essential to producing the outgoing long wavelength modes in this model since a long wavelength ingoing mode will of course sail across the horizon into the black hole rather than converting to an outgoing mode .",
    "this mechanism is studied in section [ evasion ] with the help of the eikonal approximation .",
    "we adopt units in which @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the coordinate lattice spacing , and we use the  timelike \" metric signature .",
    "our goal is now to  latticize \" the theory of a scalar field propagating in a static black hole spacetime . for each",
    "spherical harmonic , the physics reduces to a two - dimensional problem in the time - radius subspace .",
    "the short distance phenomena we wish to study have nothing to do with the scattering of modes off of the angular momentum barrier , so nothing essential is lost in dropping the angular dependence and studying instead the physics in a two dimensional black hole spacetime .",
    "we begin with a generic static two dimensional spacetime , and choose coordinates so that the line element takes the form @xmath5 the curves of constant @xmath6 are orbits of the killing field @xmath7 .",
    "the curves with @xmath8 are geodesics which are at rest with respect to the killing field where @xmath9 , and the proper time along these geodesics is @xmath10 .",
    "the constant @xmath10 time - slices are orthogonal to these geodesics , and the proper distance along these time - slices is @xmath6 . in appendix [ ffcoords ]",
    "we explain why such a coordinate system can always be chosen .",
    "to represent a black hole spacetime with an asymptotically flat region at @xmath11 , we choose @xmath12 to be a negative , monotonically increasing , function with @xmath13 .",
    "the event horizon is located where the killing vector becomes lightlike , i.e. where @xmath14 . for the schwarzschild black hole",
    "this coordinate system corresponds to the painlev - gullstrand coordinates@xcite , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a sketch of the relation between these coordinates and the ingoing eddington - finkelstein null coordinate @xmath17 is given in figure [ painleve ] .",
    "( the wavepacket trajectory is discussed in section [ origin ] . )",
    "a new coordinate @xmath18 that is constant on the free - fall worldlines @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 this yields the line element @xmath21 where @xmath6 is now a function of @xmath22 obtained by solving ( [ y ] ) for @xmath6 . in these coordinates the killing vector is given by = _",
    "t + _ y. [ xity ]    the action for a real scalar field in these coordinates is @xmath23 and the equation of motion is @xmath24    we could now alter the theory to include high frequency dispersion by replacing @xmath25 by @xmath26 in the action ( [ s ] ) .",
    "this is similar to what was done in the models already studied@xcite , the only difference being that there it was @xmath27 that was replaced by @xmath28 . since @xmath29 , these two modifications are essentially the same near the horizon where @xmath14 , and in fact they are quite similar in all regions where @xmath12 is of order unity .",
    "it is only asymptotically , where @xmath12 goes to zero , that their behavior should differ substantially .",
    "we previously preferred to modify @xmath27 since it is the derivative with respect to _ proper _ distance on a constant @xmath10 surface everywhere .",
    "now however we want to _ discretize _ the spatial coordinate and , as explained in the introduction , we do not want to discretize @xmath6 because it is infinitely accelerated at the horizon .",
    "instead , we discretize the free - fall coordinate @xmath18 .    one possible spatial discretization of the action is and @xmath30 in the second term in the action . ]",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the forward differencing operator @xmath33 , @xmath4 is the lattice spacing in the @xmath18 coordinate , and @xmath34 .",
    "_ in the remainder of this paper we shall work in units of the lattice coordinate spacing _",
    ", so that @xmath35 . varying the action ( [ slat ] ) gives the equation of motion for @xmath36 , @xmath37    this lattice action has a discrete symmetry ( t , m)(t+1 , m+1 ) [ dsym ] which is the remnant of the killing symmetry generated by ( [ xity ] ) .",
    "the meaning of this is that shifting forwards in time by one unit at fixed static coordinate @xmath6 is just enough time for the next lattice point to fall from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "this symmetry will be heavily exploited in the following analysis . and [ evolution ]",
    "we study a similar model in which a reparametrization of @xmath18 is discretized and no discrete symmetry survives . ]",
    "note that the @xmath18 coordinate is infinitely bunched up as @xmath40 ( see ( [ ds2ty ] ) ) , which occurs at infinity for a black hole type metric .",
    "therefore the uniform discretization @xmath41 yields a _ proper _ lattice spacing that goes to zero at infinity .",
    "this is undesirable from a physical point of view , but it is a convenient choice mathematically , since unlike other discretizations it preserves the symmetry ( [ dsym ] ) . also , as long as we do not try to evolve the scalar field modes all the way to infinity , the decreasing proper lattice spacing is benign and has no effect on the physics of the hawking process .",
    "however , since our goal is to understand how the outgoing modes can be accounted for in a theory that has a  reasonable \" short distance cutoff , we shall return to this issue in section [ evasion ] .",
    "the lattice model defined by ( [ slat ] ) was studied numerically by unruh@xcite .",
    "he found by propagating wavepackets backward in time that the outgoing modes come from exotic ingoing modes and , if these ingoing modes are in their ground states , then the outgoing modes are thermally occupied at the hawking temperature . in the next three sections we use analytic methods to understand the propagation of these wavepackets and the computation of the flux of radiation from the black hole .",
    "our results are in agreement with unruh s numerical results .",
    "due to the symmetry ( [ dsym ] ) of the lattice action ( [ slat ] ) there exist mode solutions of the form @xmath42 under the discrete symmetry ( [ dsym ] ) the mode ( [ mode1 ] ) changes by a phase factor as @xmath43 .",
    "this identifies @xmath0 as the _ killing frequency _ which is defined modulo @xmath44 and is conserved .    to derive the dispersion relation we plug the ansatz @xmath45 into the equation of motion ( [ deom ] ) and",
    "treat @xmath46 as a constant .",
    "the result is @xmath47 the _ free - fall frequency _ ,",
    "i.e. the frequency measured along the free - fall lines of constant @xmath18 , is defined by @xmath48 .",
    "the form of the modes ( [ mode ] ) then shows that _",
    "ff=+ k. [ wff ]    to understand what range of @xmath0 and @xmath49 are considered distinct , note that the modes defined by ( [ mode ] ) are invariant under the simultaneous shifts @xmath50 for any integer @xmath51 .",
    "thus we can transform any @xmath52 pair into an equivalent pair @xmath53 where @xmath54 lies within a fixed range of length @xmath55 ( the standard choice being @xmath56 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is unconstrained with this range of @xmath58 .",
    "one choice of fundamental domain of @xmath52 pairs is therefore given by @xmath59 conversely , we could just as well use the above transformation to force @xmath57 to lie within a fixed range of length @xmath55 leaving @xmath54 arbitrary .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) has a useful graphical representation ( see fig .",
    "[ graph ] ) : on a graph with abscissa @xmath49 , the straight line with slope @xmath60 and @xmath49-intercept @xmath61 intersects the curve @xmath62 at a @xmath49 that is a solution or  root \" of the dispersion relation .",
    "a wavepacket constructed from modes of the form ( [ mode1 ] ) with killing frequency near @xmath0 will propagate through the lattice spacetime with conserved killing frequency .",
    "this propagation can be represented graphically in the wkb approximation by following a point on the dispersion curve . since the killing frequency is conserved , the @xmath49-intercept of the straight line is fixed , while the slope @xmath63 of the straight line changes according to where the wavepacket is located .",
    "the direction of motion with respect to the static position coordinate @xmath64 is determined by the group velocity @xmath65 which is given by @xmath66 therefore the _ sign _ of the group velocity is the sign of the difference between the slope of the @xmath67sin curve at the intersection point and the slope of the straight line .",
    "the group velocity in terms of @xmath18 is @xmath68 , which is always less than the speed of light according to the line element ( [ ds2ty ] ) .",
    "in this section we argue using the dispersion relation that outgoing low wavevector wavepackets indeed originate as ingoing high wavevector wavepackets which  bounce \" off of the horizon .",
    "a spacetime diagram of the process is sketched in figure [ painleve ] .    to see where the outgoing modes come from , consider a late - time , positive killing frequency , outgoing packet centered on a small positive wavevector @xmath69 .",
    "this wavepacket is represented on the dispersion curve in fig .",
    "[ graph ] as the point labeled @xmath69 . following this back in time using the graphical method described in the previous section",
    "we find that it moves up the dispersion curve until it reaches the tangency point @xmath70 at which the group velocity ( [ gv ] ) vanishes .",
    "this is the turning point , where the wkb approximation fails . if @xmath71 , the straight line is extremely close to the sine curve for many @xmath49 values",
    "this means that when the wavepacket is close to the horizon it is really a superposition of many @xmath49 values , including negative ones .",
    "the amplitude of the negative wavevector piece , which determines the hawking radiation , is of order @xmath72 where @xmath1 is the surface gravity of the horizon .",
    "the positive and negative wavevector pieces both propagate back away from the horizon , evolving into the modes @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively",
    ". becomes smaller , there are also more wavevector roots to the dispersion relation with @xmath75 which are also presumably excited slightly by scattering . ]",
    "thus we see that the outgoing positive killing frequency modes come from _ ingoing _ large wavevector modes which  bounce \" off the horizon . this continuous evolution from one type of modes to another is called",
    "_ mode conversion_. the same phenomenon occurs in the continuum models in which the high frequency dispersion is put into the theory by adding higher spatial derivative terms to the action .",
    "now let us compute the values of the wavevectors @xmath76 and @xmath69 corresponding to a fixed frequency @xmath0 as @xmath77 at infinity . from the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) or",
    "[ graph ] , one sees that all three wavevectors @xmath78 , and @xmath79 converge to zero modulo @xmath80 independent of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this rather strange result follows because the continuum metric has the form @xmath81 , and so the @xmath18-lattice spacing goes to zero as @xmath17 goes to zero .",
    "therefore any mode of finite proper wavelength will have infinite coordinate wavelength and zero coordinate wavevector . to resolve these modes",
    "we can look at their proper wavevectors @xmath82 instead of the coordinate wavevectors . for the @xmath69 wavevector , as @xmath83 we may approximate @xmath84 in the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) ( with the plus sign ) , which yields @xmath85 , so the proper wavevector goes to just @xmath0 . for the @xmath76 wavevectors",
    ", we first use the symmetry relation ( [ symk],[sym ] ) to shift the coordinate wavevectors ( and therefore also the frequency @xmath0 ) so that they converge to zero as @xmath83 , and then use the small @xmath49 approximation in the dispersion relation to obtain the proper wavevectors @xmath86 .",
    "therefore the late time , long wavelength , outgoing hawking particle arises from a pair of short but finite proper wavelength ingoing modes .",
    "it follows from the discussion below ( [ gv ] ) that , at spatial infinity , the group velocity for these wavevectors is equal to the speed of light .    in the next section",
    "we compute the amplitudes of the @xmath79 and @xmath87 pieces of the ingoing wavepacket .",
    "crucial to the validity of the approximation used in this calculation is the maximum value of the wavevectors in the wavepacket solution near the horizon .",
    "we can estimate this maximum by a simple calculation using the dispersion relation .",
    "the classical turning point is located where the straight line of figure [ graph ] is tangent to the sine curve , labeled @xmath70 in the figure .",
    "although the wavepacket tunnels beyond the classical turning point , it is not propagating there , so its shortest wavelength near the horizon should be roughly given by the wavelength at the classical turning point .",
    "the wavevector at this point satisfies the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) ( with the plus sign ) and the relation @xmath88 expressing equality of the slopes of the two curves . if @xmath89 ( which is the case of interest when the surface gravity @xmath90 ) , then fig .",
    "[ graph ] shows clearly that @xmath91 as well . using small @xmath49 approximations in ( [ dr ] ) and ( [ equalv ] ) respectively and solving for @xmath49 yields @xmath92 consistent with our approximations .",
    "this very important result states that although the scale of the new physics is the lattice spacing @xmath4(=1 ) , the effects of the new physics occur long before that scale is ever reached . with the ordinary wave equation the maximum wavevector near",
    "the horizon is _ infinite _ due to the infinite blueshift ( actually it is finite but trans - planckian if the black hole is formed by collapse ) .",
    "one might have expected that on the lattice @xmath93 would be of order the inverse lattice spacing @xmath94 but ( [ knearh ] ) shows that this is not the case ( although @xmath95 does occur far from the horizon  see for example the roots @xmath79 and @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ graph ] and the accompanying discussion ) .",
    "this fact  which is also true in continuum models with high frequency dispersion  was not noticed in earlier work on dispersive models .",
    "as long as @xmath96 ( [ knearh ] ) shows that the physics near the horizon that determines the hawking flux depends only on the low order terms in @xmath49 .",
    "this result is absolutely essential for the validity of the approximation used in the next section .    in section [ evasion ]",
    "we will discuss ways to avoid the problem of vanishing lattice spacing at infinity .",
    "this problem plays no role in the calculation of the rate of particle production however , so we will now explain how this rate can be obtained in a leading order approximation .",
    "the lattice theory can be quantized in strict analogy with the quantization of linear field theory in curved spacetime so we will not spell it out here .",
    "a difference peculiar to the lattice theory ( or dispersive continuum field theories ) is that the local notion of the ground state ( or vacuum ) is not lorentz invariant but refers to the preferred free - fall frame . in a region where the function @xmath12 is constant  or is approximately constant on the scale of the relevant wavelengths  the line element ( [ ds2ty ] ) is flat and",
    "the action ( [ slat ] ) is that of a chain of identical masses coupled by identical springs .",
    "the ground state of this system is just the usual ground state of the normal modes , i.e. , it is annihilated by annihilation operators for complex solutions to the oscillator equation with time dependence of the form @xmath97 with _ positive _ @xmath98 , that is , positive free - fall frequency ( [ wff ] ) .",
    "this is the _ free - fall vacuum_.    given this initial vacuum state we would like to compute the particle flux seen by an observer sitting at a fixed location ( fixed @xmath6 coordinate ) far outside the black hole .",
    "the natural notion of particle for such an observer coincides with that defined by killing frequency , therefore we shall compute the number expectation value for an outgoing positive killing frequency packet in a state which at some initial time is the free - fall vacuum .",
    "the standard method of computing this@xcite is to propagate the outgoing packet backward in time to the hypersurface where the vacuum state is defined .",
    "the norm of the negative free - fall frequency part of this packet is then ( minus ) the number expectation value .",
    "the norm referred to here is given by @xmath99 and is the sum over a constant @xmath10 surface of the @xmath10-component of the current associated with phase invariance of the action ( [ slat ] ) ( generalized to complex fields ) .",
    "several methods can be used to compute the rate of hawking radiation .",
    "one approach is to evolve a wavepacket backwards in time by numerical solution of the lattice wave equation ( 9 ) , as was done by unruh@xcite . alternatively , since the problem has time translation symmetry , one can just work with modes of definite killing frequency .",
    "this is the approach we take here .",
    "the outgoing wavepacket is composed of wavevectors around @xmath69 ( and has positive killing frequency ) and arises from a pair of packets composed of wavevectors around @xmath79 and @xmath87 respectively ( which have positive and negative free - fall frequency respectively ) .",
    "using the arguments in @xcite , modified to the lattice model , it is straightforward to show that , for an outgoing packet narrowly peaked about the frequency @xmath0 , the number expectation value is @xmath100 where @xmath101(@xmath102 ) is the constant coefficient of the @xmath87(@xmath69 ) mode located far outside the black hole ( where @xmath12 is essentially constant ) .",
    "we now turn to the computation off these coefficients .",
    "the mode solutions to the lattice wave equation ( [ deom ] ) are of the form ( [ mode1 ] ) , ( [ mode1 ] ) @xmath103 where @xmath0 is the conserved killing frequency .",
    "plugging this into the equation of motion ( [ deom ] ) produces a delay - differential equation ( dde ) , @xmath104 where we have defined the new variable @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "a wavepacket that is outgoing at late times is composed of mode solutions that decay inside the horizon ( see @xcite for a discussion of the analogous boundary condition in a dispersive continuum model ) .",
    "we therefore need to solve ( [ dde ] ) subject to this boundary condition .",
    "the dde ( [ dde ] ) can be solved numerically , however it is more instructive , and sufficient for our purposes , to find an approximate analytic solution .",
    "we use the same analytical techniques as used in @xcite .",
    "we first find an approximate solution ( satisfying the above boundary condition ) in a neighborhood of the horizon by the method of laplace transforms , and then extend this solution far outside the black hole by matching to the wkb approximation .",
    "the mode coefficients @xmath107 can then be read off directly .      to solve the mode equation ( [ dde ] ) near the horizon we first approximate @xmath108 as @xmath109 where @xmath1 is the surface gravity of the black hole , and neglect all terms of order @xmath110",
    "this requires that we stay close enough to the horizon that @xmath111 .",
    "next we `` localize ''",
    "the dde by first taylor expanding @xmath112 , etc .",
    ", and then truncating the expansions . which terms to keep can be estimated as follows .",
    "the taylor expansions produce the equation @xmath113 where we have grouped together terms in the expansion according to the total number of derivatives .",
    "the ellipses that appear inside parentheses denote other terms with a total of four derivatives and the other ellipses denote terms with six or more derivatives per term ( only even numbers of derivatives occur in the expansion ) .",
    "truncating the equation to second order in derivatives produces the ordinary wave equation .",
    "this is not sufficient for us because arbitrarily short wavelengths appear in the ordinary wave equation solution for the outgoing modes , so we must keep at least some of the higher derivative terms .",
    "let us define an effective local wavevector @xmath114 by @xmath115 .",
    "dropping the @xmath116 term compared to the @xmath117 term is accurate provided that @xmath118 in the near horizon region @xmath119 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath114 from the dispersion relation in the near horizon approximation just as we did in section ( [ origin ] ) . outside the classical turning point ( where @xmath120 ) , but still in a region where @xmath121 , all relevant wavevectors are real and the largest wavevector behaves as @xmath122 , and therefore satisfies @xmath118 . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the relevant wavevector becomes complex and has a magnitude @xmath124 , therefore @xmath118 provided we only consider killing frequencies satisfying @xmath125 .",
    "even deeper inside the horizon where @xmath126 , the wavevector is approximately imaginary with magnitude again given by @xmath127 , and therefere @xmath118 . ignoring sixth and higher order derivatives in the equation ( [ taylordde ] )",
    "therefore requires that @xmath125 .    to further simplify the equation , note that the ratio of the @xmath128 term to the @xmath129 term is @xmath130 from above we know that @xmath131 , so we will have @xmath132 provided that @xmath133 .",
    "as long as @xmath0 is not ultra small therefore we need only keep the fourth order derivative term , however for simplicity we work with the simpler equation . ] in the expansion ( [ taylordde ] ) .",
    "we therefore arrive at the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath134 we show below by explicit calculation that the solution to ( [ ode ] ) of interest to us is consistent with the approximations made above and therefore that this truncation of the mode equation is valid .",
    "the ode ( [ ode ] ) is the same as that considered in @xcite ( except for the coefficient of the @xmath128 term ) where it was solved by the method of laplace transforms with the same boundary conditions as discussed above .",
    "we therefore refer the reader to @xcite for the details of this computation .",
    "using the saddle point approximation to evaluate the laplace transform for @xmath135 , we find that the solution satisfying the given boundary conditions can be expressed as @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138    to check the validity of our localization procedure , note for example that @xmath139 the absolute values of the two terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ check ] ) are both much less than one provided we restrict @xmath140 to the range 1 ^ -1 [ xirange ] which was already assumed in making the saddle point approximation ( [ flap ] ) and the near horizon approximation ( [ linearv ] ) . expression ( [ check ] ) is also in agreement with our earlier estimates of @xmath141 obtained by estimating the position dependent wavevector @xmath114 .",
    "similar relations hold for the @xmath142 and @xmath143 modes as well .      the next step is to propagate the mode ( [ flap ] ) away from the horizon to the constant @xmath144 region .",
    "this is accomplished by computing approximate solutions to the non - local dde ( [ dde ] ) by the wkb method .",
    "( since the wavevectors grow to order unity as @xmath144 goes to zero , we must use the full non - local dde at this stage . )",
    "some details of this computation are given in appendix [ wkbdde ] .",
    "the result is that there exist three different wkb solutions which , when evaluated near ( but not too near ) the horizon , take the same functional forms as the laplace transform solutions given by ( [ + ] , [ -],[s ] ) .",
    "an appropriate linear combination of these wkb solutions can therefore be matched to the near horizon solution ( [ flap ] ) yielding @xmath145 since the wkb approximation holds far outside the horizon , we are free to evaluate the solution there , and thus read off the constant coefficients of the modes @xmath146 with @xmath147 in the constant @xmath12 region .",
    "these coefficients are simply given by the coefficients of the wkb solutions in ( [ fwkb ] ) except that @xmath148 also contain the amplitude factors @xmath149 respectively ( see the appendix [ wkbdde ] ) .",
    "the only remaining ingredient in evaluating the number expectation value ( [ no ] ) is to compute the kinematic factors @xmath150 and group velocity @xmath151 for each wavevector . from the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) ( with the plus sign for the roots @xmath152 corresponding to a , d and e respectively in fig . [ graph ] ) and the expression for the group velocity given by ( [ gv ] ) it is straightforward to show that @xmath153 plugging in the small @xmath60 expressions for the @xmath87 and @xmath69 wavevectors computed in section [ origin ] , we find that ( [ kinem ] ) reduces to @xmath154 for the @xmath87 root and @xmath155 for the @xmath69 root . putting all these results together we find for the number expectation value ( [ no ] ) @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the hawking temperature .",
    "therefore we see that to leading order in the lattice spacing the particle flux is thermal at the hawking temperature in agreement with the ordinary wave equation .",
    "this derivation is valid as long as ( @xmath158 ) @xmath159 and ( @xmath160 ) the wkb approximation can be used to connect the far zone with the zone @xmath161 near the horizon .",
    "this last condition should be satisfied as long as @xmath0 is not extremely small compared to @xmath1 , although we shall not attempt to write out the general conditions here ( which are possibly more restrictive than the @xmath162 condition already given ) .",
    "one way to avoid the problem of vanishing lattice spacing at infinity is to simply not let @xmath12 go to zero at infinity .",
    "it might seem that we have no freedom to make this choice , since the asymptotic form of the metric is determined by the black hole .",
    "however , we need not use a free - fall coordinate that is _ at rest _ at infinity . instead , the coordinate lines can be chosen moving uniformly toward the black hole at infinity . in appendix",
    "[ ffcoords ] it is shown that , in terms of the proper time @xmath163 along the congruence of infalling geodesics of energy @xmath164 and the proper distance @xmath165 along the spacelike slices orthogonal to these geodesics , the line element takes the form @xmath166 for some function @xmath167 .",
    "note that this is the same form as ( [ ds2 ] ) , with a different function @xmath168 which , in particular , does not vanish at infinity : @xmath169 . proceeding as before",

    "with this choice the preferred frame is not asymptotically at rest with respect to the black hole .",
    "although this certainly solves the problem from a mathematical point of view , it is not physically satisfactory .",
    "our  in \" vacuum boundary condition depends on the choice of the preferred frame , and it just does nt make much sense to rely on the assumption that the black hole is moving relative to the vacuum .    a more satisfactory resolution would be to choose the discretization such that the lattice spacing is a fixed proper distance on some initial slice .",
    "if we then let the lattice points fall into the black hole , the proper lattice spacing will not remain constant on the surfaces of equal proper time . nevertheless , such a lattice will be perfectly well behaved at infinity , and the time dependence will be invisible to long wavelength modes that do not  see \" the lattice at all .",
    "although they are not ultimately satisfactory , we think it is instructive to understand the physics of such models with growing lattice spacing .",
    "we now describe a class of such models .",
    "it is only necessary to reparametrize the @xmath18 coordinate ( [ y ] ) before discretizing . to this end",

    "the original @xmath6 coordinate measures proper length on a constant @xmath10 surface in the metric ( [ ds2 ] ) , so we choose @xmath170 to agree with @xmath6 at @xmath173 .",

    "[ xitz ] when @xmath182 is modified in the action , either by higher derivatives or discretization , the presence of the factor @xmath183 in ( [ xitz ] ) will prevent the survival of the symmetry generated by @xmath140 .",

    "along a line of fixed @xmath170 , @xmath184 grows as a function of @xmath10 as the horizon is approached , since @xmath6 is getting smaller and we are assuming @xmath63 grows as @xmath6 decreases .",

    "this yields the form of the line element evaluated at the horizon : ds^2_horizon= dt^2 - ^-2 dz^2 [ ds2h ]    let us now consider two examples to see what this coordinate change yields .",

    "[ ds2sh ] for numerical calculation , it would be more convenient to have @xmath12 go to zero more quickly than @xmath189 , so let us also consider the exponential velocity @xmath190 .",

    "[ ds2exph ]    discretizing the @xmath170 coordinate will yield a new lattice theory in which the proper lattice spacing is constant at infinity , so it is possible to propagate wavepackets in a sensible way all the way out to where @xmath191 .",

    "no exotic low frequency modes are available in this case .",

    "they will _ not _ bounce off the horizon .",
    "so where can a low frequency outgoing mode come from ?    the lack of even a discrete time translation symmetry seems to provide the answer .",
    "when a low frequency outgoing wavepacket is propagated back close to the horizon , it gets blueshifted .",
    "eventually its wavevector gets so large that it can sense the lack of time translation invariance in the lattice theory . at that point , there is no longer any reason for its killing frequency to be conserved .",
    "using an eikonal approximation we will show in the next section that the killing frequency is indeed shifted so that , when the wavepacket propagates backwards in time back out to infinity , it arrives with a large wavevector , on the order of the lattice spacing , and a correspondingly large killing frequency . at this stage",
    "we have no solid proof that waves on the @xmath170-lattice will behave in the way indicated by the eikonal approximation .",
    "it should be possible to adapt unruh s numerical computation on the @xmath18-lattice to see what in fact happens on the @xmath170-lattice .",
    "in deriving the eikonal approximation we forget that the space is discrete and just make the substitution @xmath192 in the continuum action in @xmath176 coordinates ( in units of the lattice spacing ) : s= dt dz ( ( _ t ) ^2 - ( ( e^_z -1 ) ) ^2 ) this leads to an infinite order pde to which the standard eikonal or geometrical optics approximation can be applied .",
    "one assumes that the wavelength and period of the wave are short compared with the length and time scales on which the background is varying and slowly changing on their own scales .",
    "this is reasonable for much of the trajectory of the wavepackets we are interested in , but the latter condition fails at the turning point near the horizon .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained in this way seem reasonable and we would be surprised if a lattice calculation failed to confirm the general picture provided by this approximation .    making this approximation , and assuming a wave of the form ( -it)(ikz ) , we arrive at the dispersion relation ^2 = -g^zz(t , z ) ( f(k))^2 , where the function @xmath193 is given by f(k ) = 2(k/2 ) [ flat ] and , using ( [ ds2tz ] ) , - g^zz(t , z ) = [ v(z)/v(x(t , z))]^2 .",

    "the ones near @xmath214 are equivalent to ordinary small negative @xmath49 modes and just cross the horizon . since the group velocity ( [ zdot ] ) is always less than or equal to the speed of light ( @xmath215 ) , these modes can never return to the outside once having crossed the horizon .",
    "coming down from @xmath214 , at some critical value of @xmath49 there is a trajectory that asymptotes to the horizon and zero @xmath49 . below this critical @xmath49",
    "are the exotic modes that bounce off the horizon and return to spatial infinity .",
    "the crucial thing to notice here is that an exotic ingoing mode can produce a non - exotic , very low wavevector outgoing mode .",
    "this is only possible because the lattice equations violate time translation symmetry at short wavelengths , so there is no conservation of killing frequency to prevent this from happening .",
    "it is intriguing that violation of time - translation invariance visible only at short wavelengths plays a crucial role in accounting for the outgoing modes . in our model",
    "this time - dependence is a consequence of the growing lattice spacing due to spreading of free - fall trajectories . at a more fundamental level ,",
    "one expects the killing symmetry of a black hole background to be violated by the gravitational back - reaction to the quantum fluctuations of the matter fields .",
    "a vague suggestion was made in @xcite that the back - reaction might evade the conservation of killing frequency and allow the outgoing modes to originate as ingoing modes from spatial infinity .",
    "our simple model studied here seems to lend credence to this hypothesis , although the implementation is still in a background field approximation and has nothing obvious to do with the back - reaction .",
    "it is scary to be violating time - translation invariance in the lattice theory .",
    "however , the characteristic timescale is long , @xmath216 according to either ( [ ds2sh ] ) or ( [ ds2exph ] ) for example , and even this time dependence is invisible to wavelengths long compared with the lattice spacing .",
    "it therefore seems that the low energy physics is immune from _ direct _ effects of this violation of time - translation symmetry , even though the outgoing modes owe their very existence to this violation !",
    "we still do not have a satisfactory discretization of field theory in a black hole background .",
    "either our lattice spacing goes to zero at infinity , or it grows as points fall in towards the horizon . for the schwarzschild metric , the total amount of growth during the hawking lifetime @xmath217 is , from ( [ ds2sh ] ) , of order @xmath218 .",
    "thus if the lattice starts out with planck spacing , it ends up with spacing of one angstrom after the evaporation of a solar mass black hole .",
    "but this is only the radial spacing . if the lattice points are falling on radial trajectories from radius @xmath219 to @xmath220 their transverse proper spacing",
    "_ decreases _ by the factor @xmath221 .",
    "it seems that to maintain a uniform lattice spacing in some preferred frame with a freely falling lattice of fixed topology is not possible .",
    "this suggests that one should be thinking about a lattice in which points can be created or annihilated in order to keep the spacing uniform .",
    "an expanding cosmology provides a simpler setting than the black hole in which to contemplate the lattice question .",
    "as the universe expands , the lattice spacing will grow if the lattice points are at rest in the cosmic rest frame .",
    "weiss @xcite confronted this issue in trying to formulate lattice field theory in an expanding universe .",
    "he noted a very interesting point : if the couplings of an interacting field theory are fixed on the expanding lattice , then the renormalized parameters at a fixed proper scale will depend strongly on the cosmological epoch .",
    "one could of course adjust the lattice parameters as the scale factor evolves , but from a fundamental point of view that is artificial . moreover ,",
    "if the lattice spacing started out in the early universe at the planck scale , it would quickly become too large to appear continuous at large scales .",
    "both these problems would be eliminated if the lattice were itself dynamical , with points being added at the right rate to keep their density constant .",
    "allowing the lattice topology to be dynamical thus seems very natural . it would be interesting to see if field theory can be sensibly formulated on dynamical lattice models and , if so , to study the consequences for cosmology and black hole physics",

    "unruh for discussions and for sharing the results of his numerical computations before publication . this research was supported in part by nsf grant phy94 - 13253 .",
    "in this appendix we show that in a general static two - dimensional spacetime coordinates can always be chosen ( at least locally ) so the line element takes the form ( [ ds2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath222 be the time - translation killing field , let @xmath223 be the unit tangent vector to a congruence of timelike geodesics all of the same energy @xmath224 and invariant under the symmetry , and let @xmath225 be the ( unique up to sign ) unit vector orthogonal to @xmath223 .",
