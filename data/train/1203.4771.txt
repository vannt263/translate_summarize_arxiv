    "deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) has attained much attention during the past fifteen years as a modern treatment of miscellaneous neural and movement disorders , especially in the treatment of the symptoms associated with parkinson s disease ( pd ) @xcite , namely tremor , rigidity and bradykinesia , but also for epilepsy @xcite , dystonia @xcite , and essential tremor @xcite .",
    "dbs also has promising effects in the treatment of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) @xcite , tourette s syndrom @xcite and depression @xcite . for the purpose of the treatment ,",
    "electrodes are chronically implanted in a specific area of the brain . in the majority of cases of movement disorders ,",
    "the targeted region is the subthalamic nucleus ( stn ) , as the stalling of dopaminergic ( inhibitory ) neurons in the substantia nigra leads to pathological synchronized oscillations in the stn , which are correlated with the clinical symptoms of pd @xcite .",
    "also other regions of the brain have been targeted for dbs , the globus pallidus internus ( gpi ) for the treatment of pd @xcite as well as treatment of dystonia @xcite , was attempted in the ca1 region of the hippocampus @xcite , and in the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus ( vim ) @xcite .",
    "frequencies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 hz ( clinically often @xmath2  hz are applied ) have been proven to give the best results in alleviating the symptoms , whereas low frequencies of roughly @xmath3hz can even worsen the symptoms .",
    "understanding the working mechanisms of dbs from computational models is not an easy exercise : recurrent neural networks with inhibitory neurons can exhibit rich behavior including synchronization @xcite ; various mechanisms of desynchronization by stimulation @xcite or nonlinear feedback @xcite , to mention a few , have been proposed .",
    "although there has been a lot of research , the action mechanism of dbs still remains elusive .",
    "at least in the last years , however , less effort has been made to analyze the action mechanisms of transcranial electrical stimulation , which is used for different purposes and is labelled with different names .",
    "probably the most established one is transcranial electrical stimulation ( tces ) , a technique which has been used to reduce drug requirements for anaesthesia in surgical operations @xcite .",
    "although it has been used in over @xmath4 operations at least up to 1998 @xcite , its working mechanism still remains to be explained .",
    "the tces technique was developed by limoge in the 1970s @xcite and the technical protocol as well as electrode placement is established under the terminus _ limoge current _ @xcite .",
    "although the way of the limoge current through the head is still not precisely known , and it is even not known if the current may , at least in parts , act by influencing peripheral nerves outside the cranium @xcite , the part of the brain where transcranial electrical stimulation has its greatest effect is presumably the neocortex , because current density decreases with the distance to the electrode . since the neocortex is the part of the brain closest to the stimulation for all standard electrode positions , it is quite likely the part carrying the greatest fraction of the current .",
    "transcranial direct current stimulation in humans was also shown to enhance excitability @xcite which on the one hand indicates plasticity effects and on the other hand shows that tces can have a pronounced effect on neocortical regions and not only on specific subcortical structures as targeted by dbs .    to account for an explanation of the action mechanism of tces ,",
    "we have built up a model of a population of neurons from the mammalian cortex , and applied external stimulation with different frequencies .",
    "this model is presented in section [ modellpraesentation ] . in section",
    "[ verallgemeinertes phasen - konzept ] we give a short introduction to generalized phase definitions and introduce order parameters which can be used to quantify the phase synchronization of the neurons .",
    "results are presented in section [ resultate ] and discussed in section [ diskussion ] . in the final section [ zusammenfassung ]",
    "we give a comprehension and present possible extensions of the model .",
    "as we want to demonstrate the basic effects in a model that is as simple as possible , we do not attempt to account for biological parameter variability , as we expect that the basic mechanism does not rely on detailed properties of a specific cortical region .",
    "our model cortex consists of @xmath5 excitatory and @xmath6 inhibitory neurons .",
    "this reflects the fact that the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons ( in the mammalian cortex ) is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "individual neurons were modelled according to the izhikevich model of spiking neurons @xcite , which contains two variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , representing the membrane potential , and a recovery variable , e.g.  a slow k@xmath10 current , respectively . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are governed by the differential equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the external and the synaptic input current , respectively .",
    "if @xmath14 , a reset is initiated , @xmath15 depending on the four parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , the izhikevich neuron can map a rich variety of neuronal spiking patterns .",
    "we use @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for the excitatory subpopulation and @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath25 for the inhibitory subpopulation .",
    "these parameter values correspond to regular spiking ( rs ) and the fast spiking ( fs ) pattern , which are exhibited by most of the excitatory and of the inhibitory neurons in the cortex , respectively @xcite .",
    "each neuron makes a synaptic connection to any other neuron with probability @xmath26 , so each neuron has @xmath1 synaptic connections on average . in reality",
    ", there are thousands of synapses per neuron @xcite , whereof here we model a small subnetwork of a local cortical assembly and therefore can not explicitely consider long - range connections .",
    "consequently , we also neglect structured connectivity , apart from taking into account a sparse random connectivity .",
    "the synaptic input current to a neuron @xmath27 is given by the sum over the postsynaptic potentials of all neurons @xmath28 presynaptic to @xmath27 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the types ( i.e. excitatory or inhibitory ) of the pre- and the postsynaptic neurons , respectively , and can take on the values @xmath32 and @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the adjacency matrix describing whether synaptic connections between @xmath28 and @xmath27 exist .",
    "the sign variables @xmath35 formally account for the excitatory or inhibitory nature of the presynaptic neuron , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then , the @xmath38 are the synaptic strengths between two types of neurons , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we have adapted the ratios of these values according to the reference model @xcite . for the axonal",
    "delay we use @xmath43ms ; @xmath44 is a time constant depending on the presynaptic neuron , with @xmath45ms for excitatory and @xmath46ms for inhibitory neurons , respectively , and @xmath47 denotes the time since the last spike of the presynaptic neuron @xmath28 ( in ms ) .    to consider the dynamics of a local neural assembly under stimulation , it is of low relevance from where incoming projections originate . to ensure non - trivial activity in the network , external input to the neural network",
    "is assumed from @xmath48 external excitatory neurons .",
    "these neurons are not explicitly modelled , but they make synaptic connections into the network with the same properties as the network synapses , and fire action potentials at random with probability @xmath49 during each time step .",
    "the model was integrated using a fourth - order explicit runge - kutta method with a time step of @xmath50ms .",
    "to quantify synchronization of an ensemble of oscillators , more convenient observables than correlation functions can be used . here",
    "we follow an established approach @xcite to define a complex - valued order parameter based on a generalized phase in a phase space appropriately chosen for the model at hand .",
    "there are at least three concepts for a generalized phase definition of chaotic oscillations @xcite . for the sake of numerical simplicity",
    ", we use a geometrical phase angle definition . in absence of external stimulation",
    ", each neuron has an attracting limit cycle in the @xmath51-space ; to define a phase , this trajectory has to be suitably projected into a two - dimensional plane , which indeed is possible here .",
    "we define the phase of the oscillator @xmath27 ( i.e. , the neuron @xmath27 ) as the angle between a given ( fixed ) direction and the position of the neuron s state in a chosen plane of the phase space , @xmath52 where the point @xmath53 is within the rotation centre of the attractor of the neuron @xmath27 in the plane of the phase space spanned by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being the time derivative of the membrane potential @xmath54 of the neuron @xmath27 .",
    "the first choice for such a plane in the phase space to be used for phase definition would be the @xmath57-space , but unfortunately the attractor in this plane has multiple rotation centres and changes its position for different stimulation intensities , so the @xmath58-space is a better choice . to ensure a monotoneous increase of @xmath59 , one has to choose a coordinate centre within the trajectory loop",
    "; here we select the point @xmath60 as rotation centre .",
    "we further choose @xmath61 ( rather than @xmath62 which results in @xmath63 ) to ensure @xmath64 , for convenience .",
    "other linear combinations of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and their first time derivatives could be used as well as an embedding of the dynamics .",
    "we define the complex - valued order parameter @xmath67 of the phases as @xmath68 this definition is according to the definition of the order parameter in the kuramoto model of phase synchronization @xcite .",
    "we analyze the synchronization in the whole population ( @xmath69 ) , the excitatory subpopulation ( @xmath70 ) and the inhibitory subpopulation ( @xmath71 ) as well , so @xmath72 can be @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the absolute value @xmath76 of @xmath67 lies in the interval @xmath77 $ ] , where @xmath78 corresponds to a complete unsynchronized state and @xmath79 to complete synchronization .",
    "as these order parameters oscillate already for the unstimulated system , we are mainly interested in the average of the order parameters , which we denote by a bar , e.g. @xmath80 .",
    "in the unstimulated system , we observe tightly synchronized spike volleys that occur with @xmath81hz .",
    "this is in the alpha - range which is associated with an alert but relaxed state .",
    "this synchronization phenomenon is widely known for random coupled neural networks @xcite .    as",
    "one can already suspect by looking at the distribution of the spikes over time , all three order parameters have big values close to @xmath79 , at least between spike volleys .",
    "when such a population spike occurs , the order parameters break down and reach values that can be as small as @xmath45 or even smaller for a very short time .",
    "the dynamics of the unstimulated system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1spikehisto ] in each of the subfigures ( a - h ) before the stimulus onset . at 3000ms ,",
    "stimulation impulses were applied according to different protocols as described below . for each stimulation type ,",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the respective network activities ( left panels ) , as well as the time - dependence of the order parameter ( right panels ) .      for ( uninterrupted ) dc stimulation , the frequency of the spike volleys",
    "is increased , but the spike volleys of the excitatory subpopulation still remain discriminable .",
    "in contrast to that , the inhibitory subpopulation now fires continuously , as there are only few and relatively weak inhibitory - inhibitory synapses which could affect this subpopulation to cease fire .",
    "ms of four simulations , for the excitatory ( left - hand side ) and the inhibitory ( right - hand side ) subpopulation .",
    "the stimulation protocol is as follows : stimulation @xmath12 was switched on @xmath82ms after initialization for @xmath83ms .",
    "each stimulation is monopolar ( excitatory dc stimulation ) and either uninterupted dc ( a , b ) , or modulated by a rectangular envelope of 10hz ( c , d ) , 100hz ( e , f ) , or 1000hz ( g , h ) , respectively . before and after the stimulation , the behavior of the unstimulated system is visible .",
    "[ fig1spikehisto ] , width=529 ]     over the time ( ordinata : relative to stimulation onset @xmath84 ) .",
    "amplitude of stimulation is @xmath3 in both cases .",
    "note the different scaling of the abscissae on the left- and the right - hand side .",
    "( a),(b ) before stimulation .",
    "( c),(d ) uninterrupted stimulation .",
    "( e),(f ) @xmath3hz rectangular pulses .",
    "( g),(h ) @xmath0hz rectangular pulses .",
    "( i),(j ) @xmath83hz rectangular pulses .",
    "[ fig2 ] , width=453 ]    for this type of stimulation , @xmath80 is decreased .",
    "in fact , it is the strongest reduction of @xmath80 that we observe for all stimulation frequencies .",
    "but if one takes a view on the order parameters of the two subpopulations , one gets a different finding .",
    "@xmath85 is even increased .",
    "in contrast , @xmath86 fluctuates strongly and fast almost between @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 is decreased all in all , but not as strong as @xmath80 .",
    "so , the reduction of @xmath80 stems in parts from the desynchronization of the inhibitory subpopulation , but also from the desynchronization of both subpopulations from each other .      for low frequency stimulation ,",
    "the spiking pattern of the excitatory subpopulation remains almost unchanged , but as such frequencies are near the systems eigenfrequency , we have a resonance phenomenon . therefore , the population spikes are now time - locked to the stimuli , and occur with exactly the freqency of the stimulation .",
    "hence the activity becomes more synchronized , leading to the observable effect that all three order parameters are increased ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if we increase the frequency of the stimulation to high frequencies of @xmath88hz , the spike volleys still occur during stimulation and synchronize with the stimulation frequency .",
    "if the amplitude of the stimulation is not high enough , some stimuli may be missed , so that , for example , three spikes occur locked to the stimuli , and then for another two stimuli , the neural network is silent .",
    "this finding is supported by the order parameter @xmath80 , which decreases around @xmath0hz .",
    "it does not decrease as much as for the uninterrupted stimulation , but in contrast to that kind of stimulation , the order parameter @xmath89 of the excitatory subpopulation decreases as well , and below the baseline value of the unstimulated case .",
    "similarly , @xmath90 is decreased , but the minimum is not as sharp as for @xmath89 .",
    "if we increase the stimulation frequency further , the individual neurons can not follow the stimulation frequency , and we observe spike time characteristics that are very similar to the unstimulated case .",
    "all three order parameters again increase to higher values .",
    "one could think that it is possible to reproduce the desynchronizing effect of the moderate high frequencies by increasing the stimulus amplitude , but unfortunately we could not generate such effect ( not shown ) .",
    "as we did not model aspects like synaptic plasticity , there are no long - term effects of the stimulation .",
    "all effects cancel out with cessation of stimulation , except a small reduction in spike rate , which soon returns to baseline values .",
    "we applied depolarizing electrical stimulation to a simple cortex model .",
    "the stimulating current is interrupted with different frequencies .    if not stimulated , the model exhibits synchronized spike volleys or population spikes at frequencies that lie in the alpha range .",
    "this synchronization phenomenon is widely known for randomly coupled neural networks @xcite .",
    "the three order parameters we have defined are close to the maximum value @xmath79 when there are no spike volleys , but break down when population spikes occur .",
    "this is not surprising as the movement on the trajectories is very fast during spikes , compared to the time between spikes .",
    "thus , if there is only a little difference between the spike timings of two different neurons , they may be far apart from each other , whereas for the time between population spikes , all neurons have values of @xmath8 and @xmath91 located in a small volume of the phase space .",
    "thus the phases are very similar between population spikes and more different during the population spikes , and the order parameters break down in the latter case .    for uninterrupted dc stimulation the frequency of the spike volleys increases , and",
    "the inhibitory subpopulation begins to fire continously .",
    "although the average order parameter @xmath80 of the whole population decreases strongly , the order parameter @xmath89 of the excitatory subpopulation is increased by uninterrupted stimulation . enhanced synchronization in large groups of neurons",
    "is also reason for epileptic spasms .",
    "as motor neurons ( which are - excitatory - pyramidal neurons ) can be effected by tces as well as any other population in the cortex , we think this effect could be a possible explanation of the clonic spasms which are produced by uninterrupted high intensity extracranial dc stimulation @xcite .",
    "if the stimulation is interrupted at low frequencies , population spikes become time - locked to the stimuli , and the order parameters @xmath80 and @xmath89 even increase .",
    "this is not unexpected as stimulation near the eigenfrequency of a system leads to resonance .",
    "if we think about dbs , for which a similar frequency dependence of effectiveness as for tces is observed ( e.g. , compare @xcite for tces with @xcite for dbs ) , it is known that stimulation with low frequencies can even worsen the symptoms which are associated with too strong pathological synchronization @xcite . in terms of tces",
    ", such a stimulation would possibly counteract any anaesthetic action , but this can not be said definitely as there seem to be no experiments on that yet .    for stimulation with moderately high frequencies , we found the introduction of a new activity pattern .",
    "as the neurons try to follow the stimulation frequency , smaller spike volleys occur which are locked to the stimuli .",
    "but due to the short duration of the stimuli , some of them are missed by the population spikes , and only a smaller number of neurons participates in each such spike volley , compared to the intrinsic volleys .",
    "effectively , this is a desynchronizaton of the neural activity .",
    "it is well known that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus with such moderately high frequencies cancels out the pathological synchronization induced by parkinson s disease .",
    "we propose that in the cortex this desynchronization phenomenon intercepts neural information processing , as it is known from experiments on electroanaesthesia ( ea ) @xcite , which eventually lead to the invention of tces .",
    "for very high stimulation frequencies , the desynchronizing effect again vanishes .",
    "this is in compliance with investigations in dbs @xcite , reporting stimulation in the khz range to have no effect , and with old reports on ea showing the current intensity necessary for the loss of consciousness to greatly increase for such high frequencies @xcite .",
    "in fact , increasing the stimulation amplitude could not fully compensate the effect of increasing the frequency in our model . instead , by increasing the amplitude of stimulation , we rather found effects similar to those of uninterrupted current .",
    "perhaps this explains why currents with a frequency of approximately @xmath0hz , modulated with ultra high frequency currents ( @xmath88khz ) , are comparatively effective than the unmodulated current @xcite .",
    "if the ultra high frequency current acts similar to an uninterrupted current , the effect is expected to be similar to the unmodulated @xmath0hz current , but it has lesser secondary effects , as less current is delivered to the brain .",
    "deep brain stimulation and transcranial electrical stimulation are two promising applications of electrical currents in medical practice . whereas dbs has largely replaced pallidotomy in the treatment of parkinson s disease @xcite , and is prosperous in the treatment of some other neural diseases @xcite , tces yet does not have reached a comparative level of potential applications that it could have in surgical practice .    in summary , we have presented a generic cortex model which reproduces the frequency dependence of the activity of tces : with uninterrupted stimulation , the overall synchronization is decreased but the synchronization of the excitatory subpopulation is increased . for moderately",
    "high frequencies synchronization of the whole population and the excitatory subpopulation is decreased as well .",
    "we assume the same mechanism to account for the similar frequency dependence of the efficacy of dbs , resulting in a drastic desynchronization of the spiking activity .",
    "stimulation of our cortex models with unipolar @xmath0hz rectangular waveforms leads to distinct changes of the spiking properties of the neural network , and it markedly reduces the synchronization of the network , which is quantified by the order parameters @xmath80 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . whereas slower or higher stimulation frequencies do not lead to such distinct changes , and instead can even tend to enforce the natural behaviour of the model , moderately high frequencies ( around 100 hz ) lead to a desynchronization of activity .",
    "we therefore suppose that desynchronization of cortical activity and the introduction of cortical noise is at least in parts accountable for the effects of tces , as it disrupts ongoing signal processing in the cortex .",
    "this model obviously just gives hints to the the question how tces actually works .",
    "to consolidate our theory that the desynchronization of cortical activity leads to the beneficial effects of tces we would have to build up a more complex and of course larger model containing more neurons , which should take into account the spatial structure of the brain . if a spatial distribution of the neurons is modeled , one should desist from assuming homogenous electrical fields and model explicitly the electric field distribution .",
    "also , neurons could be modeled in different degree of detail , e.g. , according to izhikevich @xcite taking into account more firing patterns , or as advanced versions of hodgkin - huxley neurons with realistic synaptic dynamics , including synaptic plasticity and axonal delays that depend on the spatial distances of the neurons .",
    "similarily , a multi - compartment model  containing at least two or three compartments for axon , soma , and eventually dendrite  could be used . while the quantitative dynamics of such more detailed models might come closer to reality , we expect those models to exhibit a similar desynchronization effect in the 100hz regime , as demonstrated in our model",

    "<S> transcranial electrical stimulation ( tces ) and deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) are two different applications of electrical current to the brain used in different areas of medicine . both have a similar frequency dependence of their efficiency , with the most pronounced effects around @xmath0hz </S>",
    "<S> . we apply superthreshold electrical stimulation , specifically depolarizing dc current , interrupted at different frequencies , to a simple model of a population of cortical neurons which uses phenomenological descriptions of neurons by izhikevich and synaptic connections on a similar level of sophistication . with this model </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to reproduce the optimal desynchronization around 100hz , as well as to predict the full frequency dependence of the efficiency of desynchronization , and thereby to give a possible explanation for the action mechanism of tces .     + </S>"
