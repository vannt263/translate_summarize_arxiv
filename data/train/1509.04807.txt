    "it is clear that the polynomials @xmath34 depend on both @xmath2 and @xmath4 , but we suppress this dependence to lighten notation .",
    "note that for any function @xmath33 , the optimal approximant @xmath34 ( @xmath37 ) exists and is unique , since @xmath38 is the orthogonal projection of the function @xmath39 onto the finite dimensional subspace @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath7 .",
    "note that elements of @xmath9 are _ not _ always invertible in the space : in general , @xmath42 when @xmath28 .",

    "what are the optimal approximants , and what is the rate of convergence of @xmath56 ?",
    "how are the zeros of the optimal approximants related to these rates , and does the location of the zeros of @xmath34 give any clues about whether a function @xmath2 is cyclic or not ?",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , it was explained that ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1 ) for the particular statement used here ) the coefficients @xmath58 of the @xmath7th optimal approximant are obtained by solving the linear system @xmath59 with matrix @xmath60 given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for simple functions",

    "the proofs of these theorems rely on connections between the @xmath34 , orthogonal polynomials in certain weighted spaces determined by the given @xmath2 , and reproducing kernel functions for the polynomial subspaces @xmath73 .",

    "the starting point , given a function @xmath2 whose optimal approximants we wish to study , is to introduce a modified space with inner product @xmath78 ; for the hardy and bergman spaces this amounts to changing lebesgue measure ( on @xmath57 or @xmath79 respectively ) to weighted lebesgue measure with weight @xmath80 .",
    "we study orthogonal polynomial bases for the subspace @xmath40 and obtain a formula for the optimal approximants in @xmath44 in terms of the orthogonal polynomials ( proposition [ orthopolrepresentation ] ) . for the hardy space",

    "we examine reproducing kernels for the subspaces @xmath40 .",
    "a relation between the reproducing kernel functions and the optimal approximants ( see equation ) is key , and allows us to prove our main result , theorem [ norootsallalpha ] .    by combining our results ,",
    "we can characterize cyclicity of a function in the @xmath44 spaces in terms of a pointwise ( only ) convergence property of the sum of absolute values of orthogonal polynomials ; this is discussed in section [ s - kernelscyclicity ] .",

    "furthermore , an inspection of the formulas reveals that for even @xmath7 , the optimal approximants @xmath34 have no real roots , whereas for odd @xmath7 , the optimal approximant @xmath34 has exactly one real root , which lies on the negative half - axis .",
    "our arguments below are elementary in nature , and clearly limited to this particular @xmath100 , and similar functions . nevertheless , the above observations provided some evidence in support of the notion that optimal approximants are zero - free in the unit disk .    parts ( a ) and ( c ) can be derived by long division of polynomials : applying ruffini s rule to the expression once yields and using ruffini s rule again on , gives .",

    "theorem [ charact ] is , in a sense , a qualitative optimal approximant version of the known characterization of outer functions as those satisfying @xmath334 it would be of great interest to know whether a version of theorem [ charact ] also holds in other spaces .    without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath335 ( otherwise divide @xmath2 by @xmath336 ) . as was explained in the introduction , the coefficients @xmath337 of the optimal approximant of order @xmath7",
    "are given by the linear system @xmath338 by virtue of the existence and uniqueness of the minimization problem , the matrix @xmath60 is invertible .",
    "our objective is to obtain the coefficients by taking @xmath339    now we will use the fact that @xmath60 is a toeplitz matrix , and apply the levinson algorithm . as our matrix",
    "is in fact hermitian , we can apply a slightly simplified version of this procedure .",
    "the algorithm is based on the fact that all information of the matrix is contained in two columns ( when @xmath60 is hermitian , in one column ) .",
    "the solution is as follows : if @xmath340 are the coefficients of the @xmath7th - degree optimal approximant , then the coefficients @xmath341 of the optimal approximant of degree @xmath342 can be obtained from those previous coefficients : @xmath343 where @xmath344    since @xmath335 , the numbers @xmath345 are always real . from the expression above , we can then obtain @xmath346    finally , this gives us @xmath347    from we can recursively recover the value of @xmath278 : @xmath348 where @xmath349 is defined as in .",

    "we illustrate how the levinson algorithm can be exploited for our purposes by using it to re - derive the optimal approximants for the basic example @xmath100 . in this case , the main advantage is that @xmath354 is very simple : @xmath355    so to verify that cesro polynomials , which correspond to the choice @xmath356 , are optimal , we just need to check that they satisfy the recursive formula and the initial condition for degree @xmath156 .",
    "hence , we want to show that @xmath357 evaluating both sides of the formula reduces our task to checking that @xmath358 multiplying both sides by @xmath359 , we obtain that @xmath360 and therefore the proposed polynomials are optimal as claimed .",
    "a particularly simple case is that of @xmath2 an inner function in the hardy space .",
    "then , in the notation of the proof of the previous theorem , @xmath361 for all @xmath362 , and the polynomials do not change with @xmath126 .",
    "this means that either the optimal norm converges to @xmath156 with @xmath34 all being equal to a constant , or it does not converge .",
    "in fact , when @xmath363 , where @xmath364 is inner and @xmath365 , outer , the elements of the system depend exclusively on @xmath365 . that is , for @xmath161 , the optimal approximants depend only on the outer part of @xmath2 .",
    "another immediate consequence is that for any outer nonconstant function @xmath2 , there is some @xmath366 such that @xmath367 . in other words ,",
    "inner functions are _ characterized _ by having optimal approximants of all degrees equal to a constant .",
    "we now return to the zero sets of optimal approximants , with a view towards determining the location of zeros analytically .",
    "our first result states that the roots of @xmath34 can be expressed in terms of certain inner products .",
    "if some zero @xmath374 is repeated , the solution is still unique but we count multiplicity . note also that if @xmath2 is a cyclic function but not a constant or a rational function , then there is an infinite subsequence @xmath375 such that @xmath376 ; if not , @xmath377 can not tend to @xmath156 as @xmath378 .",
    "the first - order approximant @xmath379 to @xmath32 is obtained by solving the system of equations @xmath380 and @xmath381 suppose @xmath382 ( otherwise interpret @xmath383 as being equal to infinity ) . then @xmath384 is equivalent to @xmath385 and by then , we obtain @xmath386    next , we note that can be expressed as the orthogonality condition @xmath387 to prove the lemma for the optimal approximant of @xmath32 of any degree , it is enough to apply equation to a function @xmath163 that is the product of @xmath2 with a polynomial of degree @xmath234 : @xmath388 if the optimal polynomial to invert @xmath2 has @xmath7 zeros , each of them has to satisfy a corresponding orthogonality condition for a different @xmath163 .",
    "moreover , the fact that we multiply the polynomial by a constant does not affect the orthogonality condition , and the zeros are determined exactly by those orthogonality conditions . since the polynomials are unique , the zeros are also uniquely determined",
    ".      we shall now use lemma [ zeroreprlemma ] to show that optimal approximants to @xmath32 have zeros in @xmath79 for judiciously chosen @xmath2 , or in other words , that the associated kernels @xmath204 have extraneous zeros .",
    "we present two families of examples , one that is completely elementary , and one that requires more work but has the advantage of producing extraneous zeros in the disk for the classical bergman space .",
    "[ smallex ] we begin by treating the spaces @xmath9 with @xmath392 . an equivalent norm for @xmath9 is given by the integral @xmath393 and",
    "so the spaces @xmath9 coincide ( as sets ) with the standard weighted bergman spaces discussed in @xcite and also studied in @xcite , among other references .",
    "we return to the functions @xmath394 and set @xmath395 .",
    "a direct computation shows that the first optimal approximant to @xmath396 in @xmath116 vanishes at @xmath397 a point inside the disk . by differentiating the function @xmath398 with respect to @xmath4 , we see that @xmath383 is increasing on the interval @xmath399 $ ] , and hence the optimal approximant @xmath372 to @xmath396 has a zero in @xmath79 , for any @xmath9 with @xmath400 .",
    "in fact , by choosing @xmath401 large enough we can produce an extraneous zero also for the range @xmath402 .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "straight - forward linear algebra computations produce the first few optimal approximants to @xmath396 : @xmath403 and @xmath404 it can be checked that the zero sets @xmath64 , @xmath405 , are all contained in the unit disk ; see figure [ extraneousfig ] .      we have @xmath407 and we see that @xmath408 .",
    "moreover , @xmath409 is cyclic as a product of the cyclic multiplier @xmath410 and the function @xmath63 , which is cyclic in @xmath411 for all @xmath412 , and hence also in @xmath116 .",
    "using euler s formula @xmath413 to compute @xmath414 and @xmath415 , we find that the first - order optimal approximant to @xmath91 in @xmath116 vanishes at @xmath416      it can be checked , again by hand , that the zeros of the first few optimal approximants to @xmath396 in the bergman space @xmath18 are in the complement of the unit disk , see figure [ nonextraneousfig ] .",
    "in fact , one can show that @xmath417 for all @xmath418",
    ".    however , this is not always the case ! before presenting a specific example , let us give a heuristic explanation for why the zeros of optimal approximants may move inside @xmath79 for bergman type spaces .",
    "let @xmath2 be a cyclic function in the bergman space @xmath18 , say , and define @xmath419 , assuming the normalization @xmath420 .",
    "then by , we need to find @xmath2 such that @xmath421 , or equivalently , @xmath422 letting @xmath283 be defined by @xmath423 , this equation becomes @xmath424 where , since @xmath425 is a contractive divisor and hence an expansive multiplier in all bergman spaces with logarithmically subharmonic weight ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we have that @xmath426 in other words , we are looking for @xmath283 such that the measure @xmath427 has total mass at most @xmath39 but has center of mass close enough to @xmath39 to ensure that holds .",

    "all the requirements will be fulfilled and the zero of the first approximant will move inside @xmath79 .",

    "the failure of bergman space analogs of results for hardy and dirichlet spaces is a common occurrence .",
    "one example of this phenomenon that seems relevant is the existence of non - cyclic invertible functions in the bergman space that was discovered in @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath20 and the dirichlet space , where invertibility implies cyclicity . in @xcite , as in our example [ bigex ] , the source of unexpected bad behavior is not , as one might predict , a  large \" set on the boundary where the function vanishes , but rather the presence of regions of rapid growth of the function .",
    "another example , close in spirit to the previous example , of how hardy and bergman spaces are different can be found in @xcite .",

    "viewed in a different light , it is perhaps somewhat surprising that there are extraneous zeros inside the disk in the case of the unweighted bergman space .",
    "an important step in the construction of contractive divisors for bergman spaces ( see @xcite ) is to rule out extraneous zeros of a certain extremal function .",
    "this can be done for the bergman space , and more generally for the weighted spaces @xmath9 for @xmath453 , but extraneous zeros do appear when @xmath454 , see @xcite . in our case ,",
