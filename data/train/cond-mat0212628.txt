    "the method proposed below treats the magnetic field at @xmath51 _ ab initio _ , and at no stage of the calculation does the vector potential appear explicitly .",
    "in addition to the apparent gauge invariance the developed technique shows clearly that although the hamiltonian in the magnetic field is not translational invariant , any measured quantity like conductivity can be calculated in an explicitly transitional invariant manner . the calculation is based on the fact that the green s function in a constant magnetic field can be represented in the form @xcite@xmath3@xcite",

    "notice that in the presence of _ e - e _ interaction the representation  ( [ defgtilda ] ) and ( [ phase1 ] ) is still valid .",
    "the rotational invariance of the core function @xmath55 is responsible for the fact that the hall current originates either from the diamagnetic part of the current operator , or with the participation of the phase terms @xmath57 no contribution to @xmath8 comes out from the core functions alone .",
    "this is because the calculation of @xmath8 in the kubo formula involves the averaging over the momenta of the nondiagonal current - current correlator @xmath58 . since the functions @xmath55 are rotational invariant , the angular integration of the type @xmath59 makes the core function s contribution to @xmath8 zero if the scattering by impurities is simple enough and does not itself produce the skew effect on average .",
    "then only the interference of the phase factor @xmath53 or the diamagnetic current make it possible to achieve the skew action of the magnetic field to avoid the vanishing of the @xmath58 current correlator after the angular integration .",
