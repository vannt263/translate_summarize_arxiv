    "observations of interstellar linear polarization ( hereafter just interstellar polarization ) give information about the magnetic field and properties of polarizing dust grains .",

    "position angles of polarization yield the directions of magnetic fields on the plane - of - the - sky .",
    "@xcite compiled the polarization data of nearly 7000 stars and showed the distribution of position angles in the galactic coordinates .",
    "the distribution of position angles for stars beyond 1 kpc of the sun traces the structure of the large - scale galactic magnetic field which runs almost parallel to the spiral arms , while that for stars within 600 pc traces the structure of the local magnetic field .",
    "the structure of magnetic field is less simple at @xmath11 @xmath12 40@xmath13 , 80@xmath13 , 260@xmath13 , and away from the galactic plane such as the active star forming regions taurus , perseus , ophiuchus , and orion , where position angles deviate from the large - scale longitudinal pattern . the local magnetic field points toward @xmath11 @xmath12 80@xmath13 and away from @xmath11 @xmath12 260@xmath13 @xcite . from the direction of @xmath11 @xmath12 40@xmath13 , a loop structure extends toward the north galactic pole .",
    "toward the loop structure and the star forming regions , the magnetic field is obviously perturbed from the uniform , large - scale structure .",
    "these indicate the existence of a random component of the magnetic field on a small - scale in addition to a uniform component on a large - scale .",
    "the random component of the magnetic field can cause a dispersion in the measured position angles and a decrease of the polarization efficiency .",
    "the polarization efficiency is defined as a ratio of polarization degree to extinction such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "if magnetic fields are tangled along the line - of - sight , degree of polarization @xmath16 does not build up as much as it would in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the extinction ( as measured by @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) along a line - of - sight is determined only by the total column of dust , so that the polarization efficiency decreases ( depolarization ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the polarization efficiency is a useful measure to probe the random component of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of 180 nearby stars that were observed polarimetrically in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 bands .",
    "they investigated the relation between color excess @xmath23 and the maximum polarization @xmath24 at the wavelength @xmath25 , and found an upper limit for the polarization efficiency , @xmath26 the polarization efficiency changes from line - of - sight to line - of - sight below the upper limit .",
    "observations at optical wavelengths are limited to regions with small extinction ( typically @xmath27 @xmath28 5 mag ) .",
    "the behavior of the polarization efficiency at large extinction ( up to @xmath27 @xmath12 100 mag ) was studied by @xcite and @xcite using near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "they compiled @xmath29 band ( 2.2 @xmath10 ) polarimetric measurements for about 100 sources at various locations and extinctions .",
    "the relation between polarization and extinction was modeled by assuming that interstellar polarization depends only on the geometry of the uniform and random components of the magnetic field .",
    "the model fits the observed relation between polarization and extinction well when equipartition of the energy density holds between the uniform and random components of the magnetic field .",
    "studies on the polarization efficiency of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) have been carried out using the comprehensive compilation of polarization data of @xcite .",
    "based on the polarization data for about 5,500 stars distributed over the entire sky and mostly located at distances of @xmath30 @xmath31 4 kpc , @xcite found a nearly linear growth of average polarization degree with extinction up to @xmath23 @xmath12 1 mag , but noted that the polarization efficiency is much lower than what is expected from completely aligned grains in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "they found the polarization efficiency that was 1/3 that of the maximum found by @xcite .",
    "they explained it by depolarization due to the random component of the magnetic field , and estimated the magnetic field strength ratio of the uniform to the random component , @xmath32 , to be about 0.8 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the strengths of the uniform and random components .    in the innermost region of the galaxy ,",
    "only a few polarimetric observations have been done ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite measured polarization for a few dozen of highly reddened ( @xmath35 @xmath31 3 mag ) stars in the area at @xmath11 @xmath12 0@xmath13 , 20@xmath13 , and 30@xmath13 in the galactic plane , and noted that the polarization efficiency is lower by a factor of about four than that in the solar neighborhood . based on polarization measurements for 127 reddened stars , @xcite reported that greater extinction results in increased polarization , but the increase is smaller than expected .",
    "they concluded that the polarization efficiency is lower than that in the solar neighborhood .",
    "their samples are not highly extincted ( @xmath35 @xmath31 0.7 mag ) , because they were selected from an @xmath36 band objective prism survey and were therefore relatively sparse and shallow .    the properties of polarizing dust grains can be examined by the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization .",
    "polarization @xmath16 shows a convex curvature with a peak @xmath24 , typically occurring at around @xmath25 = 0.55 @xmath10 , and a wing toward nir wavelengths .",
    "@xcite made a determination of the wavelength dependence of polarization , empirically establishing `` serkowski s law '' , @xmath37.\\ ] ] the slope of the wing is represented by a power law as @xmath38 with @xmath39 of 1.6@xmath92.0 from 1.25 to 2.2 @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest no systematic trend in the observed @xmath40 polarization for about 10 reddened stars with respect to a power law .",
    "however , more samples should be needed to confirm this suggestion .    now polarimetric imaging observations using several hundred thousand stars lying in the galactic bulge as background sources enable us to measure polarization degrees , position angles , and color excess finely across the area and deeply to the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , we carried out nir polarimetric imaging observations for a wide field ( @xmath12 3@xmath13 @xmath41 2@xmath13 ) toward the galactic center ( gc ) . from the polarization efficiency and dispersions of position angles ,",
    "we discuss the uniform and random components of the magnetic field along the line - of - sight on the galactic scale .",
    "furthermore , we verify whether the wavelength dependence of polarization at nir is really represented by a power law or not , and examine what types of dust grains cause the nir polarization . in section 2 ,",

    ", we present results for color excess , polarization , the polarization efficiency , and the wavelength dependence of polarization in our sample . in section 4",

    "the nir polarimetric camera consists of the single - beam polarimeter sirpol [ a rotating achromatic ( 1.0@xmath92.5 @xmath10 ) half - wave plate and a wire grid polarizer ; @xcite ] and nir camera sirius ( simultaneous three - color infrared imager for unbiased survey ; * ? ? ?",

    "we performed 10 s exposures at four wave plate angles ( 0@xmath13 , 45@xmath13 , 22@xmath485 , and 67@xmath485 ) , resulting in a total exposure time of 100 s per wave plate angle for each field .",
