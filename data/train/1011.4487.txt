    "studies of the galactic stellar halo set constraints on the formation history of the milky way and galaxy formation processes in general . for example , contemporary simulations of galaxy formation predict that stellar halos of milky - way - type galaxies are assembled from inside out , with the majority of mass ( @xmath18 ) coming from several massive ( @xmath19@xmath0@xmath20 @xmath21 ) satellites that have merged more than 9 gyr ago , while the remaining mass comes from lower mass satellites accreted in the past 5@xmath09 gyr @xcite . the actual fraction of massive versus less massive mergers will depend on the formation history of the galaxy in question .",
    "a further prediction is that the stellar halos should be more centrally concentrated and should have steeper density profiles at moderate radii ( @xmath22 kpc ) , than host dark matter halos ( e.g. , figure 9 in @xcite or figure 12 in @xcite ) . according to @xcite , ``",
    "the difference in profile shapes  and the steep rollover in the light matter at moderate to large radii  is a natural consequence of embedding the light matter deep within the dark matter satellites : the satellites orbits can decay significantly before any of the more tightly bound material is lost . ''",
    "hence , they anticipate a correlation between the extent of the stellar halo ( steepness of the density profile ) and the extent ( or mass ) of satellites that built the halo : less extended ( more massive ) satellites will build more concentrated stellar halos .",
    "therefore , the contribution of massive mergers to the formation of the milky way halo can be constrained by characterizing the stellar halo number density profile over large distances and over a wide sky area .",
    "the large area covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , with accurate photometric measurements ( @xmath23 mag , @xcite ) and faint flux limits ( @xmath24 ) , allowed for a novel approach to studies of the stellar distribution in the galaxy . using a photometric parallax relation appropriate for main - sequence stars , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter j08 ) estimated distances for a large number of stars and directly mapped the galactic stellar number density to heliocentric distances of 20 kpc .",
    "they found that the halo stellar number density distribution within 20 kpc of the sun can be fit with a two parameter , single power - law ellipsoid model @xmath25^{n/2}\\label{oblate_halo},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the cylindrical galactocentric radius and height above the galactic plane , respectively , @xmath28 is the power law index , and @xmath29 is the ratio of major axes in the @xmath27 and @xmath26 direction , indicating that the halo is oblate ( flattened in the @xmath27 direction ) .",
    "however , additional data suggest that the j08 single power law halo can not be extrapolated beyond 20 kpc . a kinematic analysis by carollo et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) suggests that the halo consists of two components with different spatial density profiles and median metallicities , with the `` inner '' to `` outer '' halo transition happening at 15 - 20 kpc , and the density profile becoming _ shallower _ beyond that point . on the other hand , the distribution of rr lyrae stars from the sekbo survey @xcite , and rr lyrae and main - sequence stars from sdss stripe",
    "82 data seem to show a _ steeper _ density profile beyond 30 kpc ( main sequence stars can be detected up to 40 kpc in coadded sdss stripe 82 ; @xcite ) .",
    "while these studies indicate a change in the halo density profile , each has its shortcomings : kinematic studies do not give a direct measurement of the density profile but rather model it under an assumed dark matter halo potential , rr lyrae stars are relatively sparse tracers of stellar number density ( @xmath30 kpc@xmath31 in the solar neighborhood ; @xcite and references therein ) , and the sdss stripe 82 region covers only about @xmath32 of the sky .",
    "ideally , the halo stellar number density distribution should be mapped using main - sequence stars over a large fraction of the sky and to a distance of at least 50 kpc .",
    "such studies will be enabled by next generation wide - area surveys such as the dark energy survey @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) .    meanwhile , the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) has observed 170 deg@xmath1 of sky in four fields as part of cfhtls `` wide '' survey .",
    "the names , positions , and sky coverage of cfhtls `` wide '' fields are listed in table  [ wide_fields ] . due to their relatively small sky coverage ,",
    "these fields are effectively `` pencil - beam '' surveys for the purposes of this paper . despite the small sky coverage ( comparable to sdss stripe 82 ) , these data are very useful because of their depth ( 95% completeness at @xmath33 for point sources ; @xcite ) , corresponding to a distance limit of @xmath3 kpc for main - sequence stars , and because they observe lines of sight unexplored by other surveys .",
    "these properties allow one to study how the halo density profile changes as a function of distance and line of sight , both in the inner and outer halo .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ data ] , we give an overview of cfhtls data and describe the synthesis of sdss @xmath2 magnitudes from recalibrated cfhtls @xmath34 observations .",
    "the recalibration and transformation of cfhtls data into the sdss photometric system @xcite is done to allow the usage of cfhtls data with relations already defined on the sdss system , such as the color - luminosity and photometric metallicity relations @xcite .",
    "the cfhtls @xmath35-band observations are not recalibrated as they were not publicly available for all cfhtls fields at the time of writing . in section  [ j08comparison ]",
    ", we analyze the distribution of stellar counts as a function of position and compare it to the j08 halo model .",
    "the best - fit broken power - law model is derived in section  [ sec.break ] . in section  [ metallicity ] , we study the metallicity distribution in the halo and analyze the dependence of best - fit model parameters on the adopted metallicity distribution .",
    "we finish by discussing our conclusions in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we perform several data quality tests and post - processing steps before using the cfhtls data in scientific analysis .",
    "first , we photometrically recalibrate the data by utilizing repeated cfhtls observations and then transform them to the sdss photometric system .",
    "we also investigate the performance of different types of cfhtls magnitudes .",
    "we use the cfhtls data processed by the _ megapipe _",
    "image processing pipeline @xcite .",
    "the pipeline takes as input megacam @xcite images detrended by the elixir pipeline @xcite , and performs an astrometric and photometric calibration on them .",
    "the calibrated images are resampled and combined into image stacks .",
    "the catalogs of sources are derived by running sextractor @xcite on each image stack .",
    "the resulting catalogs only pertain to a single band ; no multi - band catalogs are generated by the megapipe pipeline .",
    "the astrometry in these catalogs is accurate to within @xmath36 relative to external reference frames @xcite .",
    "the catalogs are available for each pointing ( a @xmath37 deg@xmath1 part of a cfhtls field ) through the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) web site .",
    "since multi - band catalogs are not available , we generate them for each pointing by positionally matching sources detected in @xmath38 bands to sources detected in the @xmath39 or @xmath40 band using a @xmath41 matching radius . the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands are the deepest of the cfht bands , so most objects detected in other bands will also be detected in these two .",
    "the @xmath40 filter is the new cfht filter that was installed after the @xmath39 filter broke in 2007 october .",
    "we further match @xmath42 million cfhtls sources overlapping the sdss footprint to sdss dr7 data @xcite using the @xmath41 matching radius .",
    "we separate point - like and extended sources using the half - light - radius ( hlr ) measured ( in pixel units ) for each detected source by the sextractor . for point - like sources ,",
    "the hlr is independent of magnitude and depends only on image seeing @xcite . for each cfhtls band and pointing",
    ", we remove the dependence of hlr on image seeing by subtracting the median hlr value of bright ( 17.5@xmath018.5 mag ) sources .",
    "bright sources are used in this procedure because they are dominated by point - like sources ( see figure 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that after subtraction , the distribution of hlr values of bright sources in the @xmath43 and @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) bands can be modeled as a @xmath44 pixel wide gaussian centered at zero .",
    "we classify a source as a star if its hlr in the @xmath43 and @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) bands is less than 0.2 pixels ( after removing the dependence of hlr on image seeing ) .",
    "sources that do not satisfy this condition are classified as galaxies .",
    "to estimate the quality of this classification , we compare it to the sdss star - galaxy classification @xcite based on deep , co - added sdss stripe 82 data .",
    "the star - galaxy separation in co - added sdss stripe 82 data is reliable to at least @xmath45 ( annis , j. et al.(2011 ) , in preparation ) , and for purposes of this comparison we consider it to be the ground truth .",
    "figure  [ classification ] shows the fraction of sdss stars identified as stars in cfhtls data ( completeness ) and the fraction of cfhtls stars identified as galaxies by the sdss ( contamination ) as a function of @xmath43 magnitude . using this plot",
    ", we estimate that the observed number counts will be underestimated by about @xmath46 for @xmath47 and overestimated by about 15%@xmath020% at the faint end ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "following @xcite , the photometric recalibration of cfhtls data is separated into `` relative '' and `` absolute '' calibration .",
    "this process is schematically illustrated in figure  [ recal_schema ] .",
    "for relative calibration , we use overlaps between pointings to recalibrate all pointings within a cfhtls field onto a single photometric system ( specific to that field ) .",
    "this calibration is then tied to the sdss photometric system ( absolute calibration ) .",
    "the final step in the process is the synthesis of sdss @xmath2 photometry from recalibrated cfhtls @xmath50 observations .",
    "the cfhtls catalogs provide adaptive - aperture ( @xmath51 ) and fixed - aperture magnitudes ( @xmath52 ) for sources detected by sextractor . to compare fluxes extracted by these two methods , we select stars from the w3 field and calculate @xmath53 residuals , where @xmath54 stands for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath43 , and @xmath39 bands .",
    "the residuals are binned in @xmath51 bins and median values are calculated for each bin .",
    "the dependence of median values on @xmath51 for @xmath57 bands is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in general , we find that the median difference between adaptive- and fixed - aperture magnitudes increases linearly towards fainter magnitudes , reaching @xmath58 mag in the @xmath39 band .",
    "this indicates that there is a problem with one or both extraction methods .",
    "as we will demonstrate in section  [ photometry_check ] , the adaptive - aperture magnitudes ( @xmath51 ) are responsible for the dependence seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , based on the following reasons .",
    "first , measuring adaptive - aperture magnitudes is a more complex process than measuring at the fixed aperture ( for details see sextractor v2.5 manual ) , making adaptive - aperture magnitudes less robust .",
    "second , a caveat in the sextractor v2.5 manual warns of potential problems with adaptive - aperture magnitudes when the sextractor @xmath59 parameter is set too low .",
    "this caveat states that , `` when signal to noise is low , it may appear that an erroneously small aperture is taken by the algorithm .",
    "that is why we have to bound the smallest accessible aperture to @xmath59 '' .",
    "therefore , if @xmath59 was set too low during flux extraction , inadequate ( too small ) apertures may have been used , making @xmath51 fainter and causing @xmath53 residuals to be biased towards positive values . even though the caveat states that this may happen at fainter magnitudes ( low signal - to - noise ) , figure  [ fig1 ] seems to indicate that brighter magnitudes may be affected as well .",
    "we therefore use fixed - aperture magnitudes in the rest of this work .",
    "relative calibration places all pointings within a cfhtls field onto a single photometric system ( specific to that field ) using repeatedly observed stars that are located in regions where pointings overlap ( cfhtls pointings overlap about @xmath60 in right ascension and @xmath61 in declination directions ) .",
    "mathematically , the problem of relative calibration can be described as a @xmath62 minimization problem @xcite with @xmath63 ^ 2 \\label{chi},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the number of unique , repeatedly observed stars in the @xmath65 w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 field , @xmath66 runs over multiple observations ( pointings ) , @xmath67 , of the @xmath68th star with unknown true magnitude @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the magnitude and its error supplied by megapipe , respectively , and @xmath72 is the correction needed to place the @xmath66th pointing on the @xmath73 field s relative photometric system .",
    "the system defined with equation  [ chi ] is overdetermined , since the number of unknowns ( @xmath74[parameters ] ) is smaller than the number of observations ( @xmath75 is at least @xmath76 ) .",
    "equation  [ chi ] can be expressed in matrix form and can be solved using sparse matrix techniques ( see section 3.2 in @xcite ) .    to solve equation  [ chi ] for each field ,",
    "we use repeatedly observed stars with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "the observations in this magnitude range are not saturated and their reported photometric errors are smaller than 0.2 mag . the observations are supplied to a sparse matrix inversion code written by @xcite , and the best - fit @xmath72 values returned by this code are renormalized so that the median value of @xmath72 is equal to zero . on average , we find the rms scatter of @xmath72 values to be between 0.02 and 0.03 mag , reflecting the systematic uncertainty in cfhtls magnitudes .",
    "following relative calibration , we tie relative photometric systems to the sdss photometric system using cfhtls stars matched to sdss stars .",
    "the goal is to find the best - fit @xmath79 value for each field , such that @xmath80 ^ 2\\ ] ] is minimized , where @xmath68 runs over cfhtls stars in the @xmath73 field matched to sdss stars , @xmath81 is the cfhtls magnitude after relative calibration ( @xmath82 ) , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are sdss point - spread function ( psf ) magnitude and its error , respectively . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the sdss color and band are color@xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively ( colors and magnitudes are _ not _ corrected for interstellar medium ( ism ) extinction ) .",
    "the @xmath88 color term corrects the linear dependence of @xmath89 residuals on color caused by differences between cfhtls and sdss spectral response curves ( see figure 1 in @xcite for a comparison of spectral response curves ) .",
    "this term reduces the scatter in @xmath89 residuals and improves our estimate of @xmath79 .",
    "since cfhtls and sdss spectral response curves should not change significantly with time , the @xmath88 color term is simultaneously fit for all four cfhtls fields .",
    "note that this term is only used when estimating @xmath79 ; linear and other higher - order color terms that model the transformation of cfhtls bands into sdss bands are derived in section  [ transformation ] .    to determine @xmath79 values",

    "the best - fit @xmath88 and @xmath79 are also listed in table  [ abs_coeff ] .",

    "note that these transformations can be used even if the relative recalibration step from section  [ rel_cal ] is skipped because the best - fit @xmath72 values are renormalized so that their median is zero .      to estimate the quality of synthesized photometry",

    "we hypothesize that the @xmath110 dependence on color may be due to incorrectly determined color - dependent air - mass term by elixir or megapipe pipelines .",

    "the data presented in previous sections allow us to measure the stellar number density of near main sequence turnoff ( msto ) halo stars , and examine it as a function of position in the galaxy .",
    "the sample we obtained from the cfhtls extends to distances and galactocentric radii ( @xmath116 ) nearly a factor of two greater than previous wide - area studies that used main - sequence stars ( e.g. , @xmath117 kpc ; j08 ) .",
    "the sample also overlaps in range with studies based on rr lyrae stars ( @xmath118 kpc ; @xcite ) , and it therefore presents an opportunity to examine the behavior of the halo density profile in the intermediate range ( @xmath119 kpc ) .",

    "@xcite , we conclude that the excess is due to the leading and trailing arm of the sagittarius stream @xcite crossing the w1 beam . while the distribution and metallicity of stars in this beam may provide useful new constraints for the study of the stream ( see section  [ discussion ] ) , this ( un)fortunate fact makes the majority of w1 data unusable for the study of the smooth halo profile .",
    "density profiles in w3 and w4 beams agree within @xmath142% with the predictions of the j08 halo model in @xmath143 and @xmath144 ranges , respectively . the observed agreement is nontrivial .",
    "first , the directions observed by these beams do not overlap with the sdss data used by j08 , and therefore test their model in an entirely different part of the halo ( especially w4 beam ) .",
    "second , the cfhtls data cover a significantly larger distance range than the data used by j08 , thus validating the extrapolation to @xmath145 kpc greater distances ( and an order of magnitude change in stellar number density ) . and",
    "finally , while j08 did use a small ( @xmath146 deg@xmath1 ) area in the southern galactic hemisphere to construct their model , their best - fit parameters were largely determined by the @xmath147 deg@xmath1 of data from the north .",
    "the fact that w4 beam ( @xmath148 ) is very well matched by the model puts a constraint to any asymmetries between the northern and southern hemispheres to @xmath149% , out to distances of at least @xmath150 kpc .",
    "this conclusion is also supported to distances of @xmath151 kpc by the analysis of north versus south sdss iii wide - area imaging ( bonaca , a. et al.(2011 ) , in preparation ) .    beyond @xmath152 kpc , in both w3 and w4 beams ,",
    "the j08 model overpredicts the observed counts . in particular , the j08 model overpredicts the density observed in the final two bins of w3 beam by 20% and 40% , respectively .",
    "since we have measured incompleteness to be on the order of @xmath30% in almost the entire observed range ( see figure  [ classification ] ) , and have made the bins volume - complete , this turnover can not be a result of observational bias but an indication of a change in halo density profile beyond @xmath153 kpc .",
    "the overprediction by the model may be even greater since the observed cfhtls stellar counts are _ overestimated _ by 15 - 20% at the faint end due to the contamination by galaxies , as shown in figure  [ classification ] .",
    "the profile exhibited by field w2 is also unusual .",
    "as shown in figure  [ profiles.r.j08 ] , it is significantly steeper than either w3 or w4 profile or the j08 prediction . by itself",
    "it is well described by a single @xmath154 power law .",
    "this fit , however , is incompatible with observations from the other three directions where a shallower profile closer to @xmath155 is strongly preferred .",
    "the curious behavior appears to be a combination of two effects : i ) the overdensity created by the monoceros stream at @xmath156 kpc and ii ) the steepening of the halo profile beyond @xmath157 kpc .",
    "the monoceros stream @xcite is present in the general direction of w2 field ( @xmath158 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "for example , in an aat / wfi survey of the anticenter region , @xcite detect the stream in the @xmath159 , @xmath160 direction at @xmath161 kpc , as well as at @xmath162 , @xmath163 with @xmath164 kpc .",
    "similarly , j08 are able to trace the stream in sdss star count maps to @xmath165 and importantly , show that it extends to at least @xmath166 of galactic latitude where it forms a factor of @xmath167 overdensity with respect to the extrapolation of the smooth stellar background before and after the stream ( e.g. , as seen in the top left panel of figure 13 in j08 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the factor of @xmath168 overdensity observed in w2 .",
    "secondly , both of these studies estimate the galactocentric distance and width of the stream of @xmath169 kpc and @xmath170 kpc in direction of w2 . given that these characteristics are broadly consistent with the enhancement in the w2 direction for @xmath156kpc , and having no additional evidence to the contrary",
    ", we interpret the observed enhancement as a detection of the monoceros stream .",
    "taking into account the enhancements due to the sagittarius and monoceros streams , a single power law remains an appropriate description of the smooth halo component to galactocentric distances of @xmath171 kpc . beyond this limit",
    ", however , the observed profile appears to turn over rather quickly and the model needs to be modified to explain it .    to assess the character of the observed turnover , we fit a series of models of increasing complexity to the observed data .",
    "we use @xmath62 per degree of freedom ( @xmath172 ) as the goodness of fit metric , and search for minima in @xmath62 hypersurfaces using a levenberg - marquardt non - linear solver as implemented by the gnu scientific library . to increase the likelihood of finding the true global minimum , we repeat the minimization procedure with 10,000 different initial conditions selected randomly from a plausible range of initial values of each parameter .",
    "we begin by fitting a single j08-type power law to all admissible data pointskpc to avoid any contamination by the disk . ] of beams w3 and w4 , the first eight data points of w1 beam ( those that show no contamination by the sagittarius stream ) , and the last six data points of w2 beam ( those that we judge are past the influence of the monoceros stream ) .",

    "the @xmath177 is the normalization ( number of stars per pc@xmath178 ) for the @xmath179 color bin we use . for comparison , the fiducial model with j08 parameters shown in figure  [ profiles.r.j08 ] has @xmath180 when fitted to the same data .",
    "we next increase the complexity of the model by allowing for triaxiality of the ellipsoid , parametrized by @xmath181 ( the ratio of ellipsoid axes ) : @xmath182 this addition makes practically no difference ; the best - fit model changes only slightly ( @xmath173 pc@xmath31 , @xmath174 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 ) while @xmath172 actually increases ( to @xmath185 ) because of the extra degree of freedom .",
    "we continue by permitting the triaxial halo ellipsoid to rotate in the @xmath186 ( galactic ) plane by an angle @xmath187 : @xmath188 this five - parameter model marginally improves the fit ( @xmath176 ) , but converges to parameters @xmath189 pc@xmath31 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 that are strongly excluded by prior data ( e.g. , @xcite , j08 , and others ) .",
    "given the results of this series of experiments , a single power law is unlikely to describe the observed counts : the data require a functional form allowing for a change in the radial profile beyond @xmath153 kpc .",
    "we therefore attempt a series of simple `` broken power law '' models , where the density follows one ( the `` inner '' ) power law until radius @xmath194 is reached , and the other ( the `` outer '' power law ) beyond .",
    "we begin with a minimal extension of a single power law model , allowing for a change of the power law index beyond a certain radius @xmath194 : @xmath195 note that , as the ellipsoid is allowed to be oblate or prolate , the break radius @xmath194 is only equal to the physical galactocentric radius @xmath116 on the @xmath196 axis ( along the line connecting the galactic center and the sun ) . in the vertical direction ,",
    "the physical radius corresponding to @xmath194 is reduced by a factor of @xmath197 .",
    "the above model , with five free parameters , produces a significantly better fit to the data ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the inner power law , @xmath199 pc@xmath31 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 kpc , @xmath203 are in excellent agreement with the j08 model , while beyond @xmath204 kpc the best - fit profile becomes steeper than the j08 model .    as shown in figure  [ profiles.r.diff.sji10 ] ,",
    "the observed profiles are better fit by the broken power law than by the j08 model , excluding regions with known tidal streams . a fit that entirely excludes w1 and w2 fields ( not just the regions with known tidal streams ) does not strongly constrain the broken power law model . in this fit , the normalization @xmath177 has high ( @xmath205 ) fractional uncertainty and strongly correlates with oblateness @xmath206 and break radius @xmath194 ( correlation coefficient is @xmath37 ) .",
    "this strong correlation is caused by similar positions of w3 and w4 beams in @xmath207 and @xmath208 planes with respect to the galactic plane ( see figure  [ xsections ] ) . in comparison ,",
    "our best - fit profile that uses all four beams while excluding regions with known tidal streams shows much weaker correlation between @xmath177 , @xmath206 , and @xmath194 ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "the inner parts of the w3 field in our best - fit model do show a systematic underestimate of the counts by the model on the order of @xmath142% ( at an approximately @xmath210-@xmath211 level ) , while the opposite occurs in inner parts of the w1 field .",
    "these lines of sight point toward high latitudes in the northern and southern galactic hemispheres , and the observed difference may be a signature of slight north - south asymmetry of halo star counts recently seen in sdss iii data ( bonaca , a. et al.(2011 ) , in preparation ) .    to further assess the robustness of the detected break",
    ", we examined two more variants of the model : the first , where we allowed the outer halo to have an oblateness parameter @xmath206 different from that of the inner halo , and the second , where we fixed the parameters of the inner halo to j08 values , and allowed only those of the outer halo to vary .",
    "both cases resulted in a similar value of @xmath172 , as well as similar break radii ( @xmath212 kpc ) and outer power law indices ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "importantly , the model with varying @xmath214 and @xmath215 produced best - fit values of @xmath216 and @xmath217 for the two , respectively , indicating that there is no evidence for a change in oblateness of the halo across the range of distances examined .    based on the above analysis , we conclude that the detection of steepening of the halo density power law is robust .",
    "to explain the cfhtls data , the power law index needs to change from @xmath218 to @xmath219 around @xmath212 kpc .",
    "an r@xmath0z plane visualization of the j08 power - law halo model and the broken power - law model presented in this paper is shown in figure  [ rzplots ] .",
    "we also fit einasto s model @xcite to our data to allow easy comparison with density profiles obtained from @xmath220-body simulations @xcite .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the einasto s model are @xmath7 , @xmath221 kpc , @xmath222 stars pc@xmath31 , and @xmath200 with @xmath223 .",
    "due to contamination by galaxies at the faint end ( see figure  [ classification ] ) , the @xmath203 power law index given above is likely somewhat shallower than what it should be . to estimate by how much @xmath224 is shallower due to contamination by galaxies , we determine @xmath225/completeness(r)$ ] for each star , where @xmath106 is a star s @xmath106 band magnitude , and @xmath226 and @xmath227 are the solid and dashed lines from figure  [ classification ] , respectively .",
    "we sum @xmath228 values in distance modulus bins and use them instead of raw number counts when fitting the model . with this approach ,",
    "a star located in a distance modulus bin with higher galaxy contamination will contribute a value smaller than one towards the total count in that bin .",
    "finally , we find that @xmath224 decreases by 0.1 to @xmath229 , which is still within the uncertainty of @xmath6 determined previously .",
    "in addition to stellar number density distribution , the metallicity distribution can also provide strong constraints for halo formation models .",
    "thanks to cfhtls @xmath104 band data , it is possible to compute photometric metallicity using a method developed by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the absolute magnitude of a star , and hence its distance , depend on the star s metallicity ( equation  [ m_r ] ) and thus it is important to study systematic errors in best - fit model parameters as a function of metallicity distribution .",
    "figure  [ feh_d ] shows the median halo metallicity in four cfhtls beams as a function of distance from the galactic center , @xmath116 . in the two beams where significant substructure is not detected ( w3 and w4 beams ) ,",
    "the median metallicity is independent of distance and averages to @xmath125\\sim-1.5 $ ] dex with a range of 0.1 dex .",
    "this average value is consistent with the median halo metallicity measured by @xcite using sdss f- and g - type main sequence stars , and the range is consistent with the systematic uncertainty inherent to this photometric metallicity method ( @xmath44 dex , @xcite ) .",
    "the average metallicity in the w1 beam is also independent of distance and averages @xmath125\\sim-1.5 $ ] dex .",
    "this trend is probably a coincidence since the sagittarius tidal stream passes through the beam and the stream s metallicity is not required to be @xmath125\\sim-1.5 $ ] dex everywhere . on the contrary , models and observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) suggest that the metallicity exhibits a gradient along the sagittarius tidal stream  we simply happen to observe the stream where its metallicity is @xmath125\\sim-1.5 $ ] dex .",
    "the metallicity in the w2 beam is a bit higher ( @xmath125\\sim-1.3 $ ] dex ) than in other beams , even at large galactocentric distances ( @xmath230 kpc ) where , according to figure  [ profiles.r.diff.sji10 ] ( top right panel ) , the contribution of the monoceros stream stars should be small . since the @xcite photometric metallicity method depends on accurate @xmath104 band photometry , anything affecting @xmath104 band measurements will also affect the photometric metallicity estimate .",
    "as discussed in section  [ photometry_check ] , the @xmath104 band measurements synthesized from cfhtls data may be impacted by some calibration issues in this beam , so these issues are likely responsible for the apparently higher metallicity in the w2 beam ( a @xmath231 mag systematic offset in the @xmath104 band will increase the metallicity by 0.2 dex ) .    our observation that the halo metallicity is independent of galactocentric distance goes contrary to @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter dej10 ) results who conclude that the halo metallicity changes from @xmath125\\sim-1.6 $ ] dex to @xmath125\\sim-2.2 $ ] dex at @xmath232 kpc . to see how our best - fit model varies when the metallicity changes from @xmath125\\sim-1.6 $ ] dex for @xmath233 kpc to @xmath125\\sim-2.2 $ ] dex beyond @xmath232 kpc , we iteratively modify the metallicity distribution in cfhtls beams to reflect the metallicity distributions shown in dej10 figure 7 ( right , hereafter @xmath125_{dej10}(d)$ ] ) .",
    "new metallicities are assigned to cfht stars by interpolating @xmath125 $ ] from @xmath125_{dej10}(d)$ ] using initial heliocentric distances , @xmath122 ( calculated from equations  [ m_r ] and  [ photo_feh ] ) .",
    "heliocentric distances are then recalculated using new metallicity values , and the metallicities are again interpolated from @xmath125_{dej10}(d)$ ] ) .",
    "this process is repeated ( about 2 - 3 times ) until the fractional difference between distances in consecutive steps dips below 0.15 ( fractional distance uncertainty for main sequence stars is @xmath234 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the broken power law model is fit to modified data once the convergence is achieved .",
    "the best - fit model parameters obtained for dej10-like metallicity distribution are listed in table  [ model_parameters ] .",
    "in addition , table  [ model_parameters ] also lists best - fit model parameters obtained for constant metallicity distributions ( i.e. , all stars are assumed to have fixed metallicity ) and for the best - fit model presented in section  [ sec.break ] . within a range of plausible metallicity distributions ,",
    "the best - fit model parameters do not seem to vary greatly and average around @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 kpc .",
    "we have recalibrated cfhtls `` wide '' survey @xmath50 observations and transformed them to the sdss @xmath2 photometric system . using a series of tests , we demonstrated that synthesized @xmath2 observations , when compared to sdss observations , show no dependence on color or magnitude .",
    "the only exception to this are the @xmath104 band observations synthesized from cfhtls w2 field @xmath55 band observations , which show a slight linear dependence on the @xmath111 color .",
    "median photometric error in synthesized @xmath2 photometry is @xmath113 mag at the bright end and @xmath44 mag at @xmath239 mag .    by obtaining the synthesized @xmath2 photometry from cfhtls observations",
    ", we were able to use the photometric parallax and metallicity relations which allowed us to study the spatial and metallicity distribution of near - turnoff main sequence stars in the galactic halo to heliocentric distances of @xmath3 kpc .",
    "we find that the halo number density profile becomes steeper at galactocentric distances greater than @xmath240 kpc , with the power law index changing from @xmath241 to @xmath242 . while the best - fit model parameters do change slightly depending on the adopted metallicity distribution ( see table  [ model_parameters ] ) , we find that a broken power law model is required for a good fit to the data .",
    "we also find that the best - fit @xmath243 value can not be smaller than @xmath244 kpc even for the most extreme assumptions about the halo metallicity distribution ( i.e. , constant metallicity at @xmath125=-2.0 $ ] dex from 5 to 35 kpc ) .",
    "this study provides further evidence for the steepening of the halo density profile previously detected by @xcite using main sequence and rr lyrae stars from the sdss stripe 82 , and by @xcite using rr lyrae stars from the sekbo survey .",
    "this result is consistent with predictions of galaxy formation simulations which find a steepening of the density profile beyond @xmath245 kpc @xcite .",
    "we see no evidence of change in halo metallicity within the range of probed distances .",
    "the halo metallicity ranges between @xmath125\\sim-1.4 $ ] dex and @xmath125\\sim-1.6 $ ] dex , and averages at @xmath125\\sim-1.5 $ ] dex .",
    "this result runs contrary to @xcite and @xcite studies which report a metallicity of @xmath125\\sim-1.6 $ ] dex within @xmath233 kpc , and @xmath125\\sim-2.2 $ ] dex beyond .",
    "only the in situ spectroscopic metallicities of distant main sequence stars may provide a definitive answer to this discrepancy . with the sky density of near - msto stars at high galactic latitudes of about 100 stars deg@xmath1 ,",
    "the multi - object capability over a wide field of view would be well matched to such a program .",
    "while the total sky coverage of the four cfhtls beams is slightly smaller than that of sdss stripe 82 ( 220 deg@xmath1 versus 300 deg@xmath1 ) , the cfhtls beams provide a much stronger constraint on the oblateness ( @xmath27 to @xmath26 semi - major axis ratio ) of the stellar halo because they probe very different galactic lines of sight .",
    "we find the oblateness to be @xmath200 and see no evidence of change across the range of probed distances ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "this result is quite consistent with the oblateness of the dark matter halo , @xmath247 , obtained by @xcite using the positions and kinematics of sagittarius stream stars .",
    "however , we find the minor axis of the stellar halo to be aligned with the spin vector of the milky way , while @xcite find the minor axis of the dark matter halo to be _ perpendicular _ to the spin vector of the milky way .",
    "we have detected the sagittarius and monoceros streams as excesses of stars in cfhtls w1 and w2 fields , respectively .",
    "these detections provide new constraints on models of these streams .",
    "for example , the @xcite model of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy predicts positions and velocities of sagittarius stream stars in the cfhtls w1 beam ( figure  [ sgr_hists ] ) . the spatial distribution of sagittarius stars",
    "is predicted to be bimodal , with a narrow peak at @xmath248 kpc , and a broader peak at @xmath249 kpc .",
    "the observed distribution of sagittarius stars in this region , overplotted in figure  [ sgr_hists ] ( top panel ) , has only one peak at @xmath249 kpc .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have radial velocity measurements in this region , and can not quantify contributions of particular streams ( leading and trailing ) to this peak .",
    "multi - epoch surveys , such as the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; @xcite ) and lsst , will enable robust identification of bright tracers such as rr lyrae stars , which can be used to map the velocity structure in this region .",
    "the resulting improvement in models of these streams may then help to further constrain the shape , orientation , and the mass of the galactic dark matter halo .",
