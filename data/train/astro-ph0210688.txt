    "neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes ( bhs ) are among the most interesting astrophysical sources .",
    "usually nss are observed as radio pulsars or as accreting objects in close binaries .",
    "similarly , stellar mass bhs are observed when they accrete matter from a companion star .",
    "here we focus on much more elusive sources , namely isolated nss ( which may show no radiopulsar activity ) and isolated bhs .",
    "an isolated ns can be relatively bright in soft x - rays due to its thermal emission during the first myrs of its life , when it is still hot ( @xmath0  k ) in the aftermath of the supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "such objects are observed in the solar proximity and in sn remnants @xcite .",
    "older nss ( that is to say those which crossed the deathline in @xmath1 yr ) are not expected to emit appreciable amounts of electromagnetic radiation in any energy band .",
    "however , accretion of the interstellar medium ( ism ) may make them shine again as soft , faint x - ray sources ( see e.g. treves et al .",
    "much in the same way , an isolated bh may be detected if it accretes from the ism , or , possibly , revealed through microlensing @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible origin of close - by , isolated nss and present some evidence that the seven radio - quiet , thermally emitting rosat sources ( the `` magnificent seven '' @xcite ) may be characterized by different values of the stellar parameters ( mass and magnetic field ) with respect to ordinary radiopulsars .",
    "we first construct the log n ",
    "log s distribution for young close - by isolated nss and compare it with present observations of close - by young isolated nss of all types .",
    "then we discuss how the alignment of the magnetic and rotation axes , together with the role of fall - back following the supernova event , may help in explaining the observed parameters of nss .",
    "finally in  3 we discuss how one can estimate an approximate positions of close - by young isolated bhs in the light of their possible detection at x / gamma - rays energies .",
    "in this section we discuss isolated nss . the material presented here is partly based on the results published in popov et al . @xcite . in addition some recent results are also included @xcite .      to understand how the local population of isolated nss originated , we construct their log n ",
    "log s distribution .",
    "the main components of our model are ( see @xcite ) : spatial distribution of ns progenitors , ns formation rate , ns cooling history , and a model of interstellar absorption ( that is to say the spatial distribution of the ism ) .",
    "in addition we calculate the dynamical evolution of nss in the galactic potential . in brief our model",
    "can be described in the following way : nss are born in the galactic plane and in the gould belt ( a local compound of stellar associations , see below ) ; at birth they receive a kick velocity ; we then follow the evolution of nss in the galactic potential ; finally , we calculate the rosat count rate basing on cooling curves and an assumed model of interstellar absorption .",
    "nss are considered to be born with a constant rate : 20 nss per myr come from the gould belt , and 250 nss per myr from the galactic plane ( up to a limiting distance of 3 kpc from the sun ) with a uniform distribution .",
    "the gould belt is modeled as a disk of 500 pc radius with an inclination of 18@xmath2 with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "its center is situated at 100 pc from the sun in the galactic anticenter direction .",
    "the central region ( @xmath3 pc in radius ) is devoided of newborn nss ( see pppel @xcite and torra et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    to calculate the thermal evolution of nss we use the data obtained by sankt - petersburg group",
    "( see kaminker et al .",
    "@xcite , and the review by yakovlev et al .",
    "the ns cooling depends on the star mass and we adopt a flat mass spectrum in the range @xmath4 . a more standard spectrum with a sharp maximum around 1.35 - 1.4 @xmath5 gives nearly the same result .",
    "cooling curves take into account all neutrino processes but ignore neutron superfluidity in the crust and core since this is not expected to influence the final results significantly .",
    "calculations for each ns are truncated when its temperature drops to @xmath6 k ; this corresponds to a ns age of 4.25 myrs for the lightest nss ( @xmath7 ) or less for more massive objects .    since we expect the ns to emit most of its luminosity at uv / soft x - ray energies ( @xmath8 ev or @xmath9@xmath10 k ) interstellar absorption plays a crucial role as far as the observability of these sources is concerned .",
    "any attempt to estimate the amount of observable cooling isolated nss using unabsorbed flux _",
    "greatly _ overestimates their number .",
    "our main results are presented in fig .  1 where we compare the log n  log s for nss born in the gould belt and the galactic disk .",
    "all curves refer to the whole sky .",
    "as can be seen the contribution from nss born in the disk fails to explain the observed distribution while the inclusion of the objects originating from the gould belt _ alone _ can match the observations .",
    "absorption , the flat geometry of ns initial distribution and the finite extension of the belt naturally explain the very flat ( slope @xmath11 ) log n  log s distribution .",
    "our calculations show that there may be at most a few dozens of unidentified close - by isolated nss in the rosat all - sky survey ( at count rate @xmath12 0.015 cts s@xmath13 ) depending on parameters of the model .",
    "also there may be a few unidentified rosat isolated nss ( rinss ) with fluxes @xmath14 cts s@xmath13 at low galactic latitudes ( see also schwope et al .",
    "most objects should be observed at @xmath15 20@xmath2 towards the directions of lower absorption .",
    "some of them can have counterparts among unidentified gamma - ray sources ( also possibly connected with the gould belt , see grenier @xcite ) .",
    "identification of these objects can be important for choosing a correct cooling model and for determination of the mass spectrum of nss .      at present about 20 nss",
    "are known which are younger than 4.25 myrs and closer than 1 kpc to the sun ( see the table ) .",
    "they include : the `` magnificent seven '' ( radio - quiet , rosat isolated nss with only thermal emission ) , geminga and the geminga - like object 3eg j1835 ( pulsars the beams of which do not intersect the earth ) , the `` three musketeers '' ( vela , psr 0656 + 14 , psr 1055 - 52 ) , psr 1929 + 10 and seven young radio pulsars , which have not been detected in x - rays yet .",
    "in addition to the observed sources , we expect about one hundred isolated nss younger than @xmath164 myr inside 1 kpc .",
    "these nss are not detected as radio pulsars , but tens of them can be identified in rosat data as dim sources ( others are too old to be hot enough ) .",
    "pulsar beaming can be responsible only for a fraction of these undetected ( in the radio ) young nss ( about 50 - 70% of young pulsars are not visible from earth @xcite ) , and most of rinss should be really radio silent .",
    "this provides strong support to the arguments by gotthelf and vasisht @xcite , that `` at least half of the observed young neutron stars follow an evolutionary path quite distinct from that of the crab pulsar '' .        & & & & & & + object name & period , & cr@xmath17 , & @xmath18 & dist .",

    "present data allow to exclude any pulsation ( down to a few % fraction ) for at least one source , rx j1856.5 - 3754 .",
    "v. beskin ( 2001 , private communication ) suggested this could be due to the alignment of magnetic and spin axes ( see for example tauris & manchester @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "alignment is a process which leads to `` period freezing '' and a low pulsed fraction .",
    "however in the case of coolers alignment should operate on short timescale , since the star cools down in @xmath29 myr . for radio pulsars",
    "the timescale of alignment is about 10 myrs or longer @xcite , so it seems unlikely that this mechanism is responsible for rinss distribution of the pulsed fraction , unless one assumes that rinss form a separate population from normal radio pulsars . to illustrate this",
    "let us assume that the alignment timescale is @xmath30 ( here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are initial values of an angle between spin and magnetic axis and of magnetic field ) .",
    "the previous expression comes from magnetodipolar braking supplemented by the condition @xmath33 .",
    "to explain the difference between @xmath34 in rinss and radio pulsars rinss need to have a different distribution in @xmath32 and/or @xmath31 . in this respect rinss",
    "may come from the same population as radiopulsars but are characterized by different average properties , like e.g. higher values of the magnetic field and relatively higher surface temperatures .",
    "the latter would imply a lower mass for nss of the same age .",
    "rinss are currently thought to be rather highly magnetized objects ( in rx j0720.4 - 3125 the detected spind - down implies @xmath35 g @xcite ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then one has to explain why their @xmath36-field is a factor @xmath37 higher than the average value in radiopulsars ( @xmath38 g ) .",
    "a possibility is that nss with higher magnetic fields are hotter .",
    "it is known that less massive nss cools more slowly because direct urca processes are not effective ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that among nss of the same age the lighter are the hotter , so to test our hypotesis we need to show that lighter nss may support a stronger field . such a correlation arises quite naturally if more massive nss get their additional mass from fall - back . in this case",
    "their magnetic field can be significantly suppressed @xcite , so more massive nss should have lower initial magnetic fields .",
    "besides , strong initial magnetic field together with fast rotation can prevent strong fall - back ( this is especially possible if the magneto - rotational mechanism of supernova explosion is valid , see @xcite ) .",
    "again this leads to the same correlation between mass and filed strength , i.e. nss with stronger fields would have lower masses .",
    "also , this picture makes room for long initial spin periods .",
    "the study of this ( and possible other ) correlation in isolated nss may prove very useful in understanding the correct mechanism of the sn event which gave birth to these objects .    in summarizing  2",
    ", we stress that future determination of rinss parallax and proper motion may help in tracing back their kinematical history and derive their age",
    ". it can give a clue to their mass determination basing on cooling curves ( see kaminker et al .",
    "our results suggest that the fraction of low - mass nss ( @xmath391.3 @xmath40 ) may not be small .",
    "on the other hand there should be room for nss with @xmath41 , because otherwise the number of bright objects would be too large .",
    "in this section we base on the results published in popov et al .",
    "@xcite and prokhorov and popov @xcite .",
    "snae explosions produce not only nss , but also bhs .",
    "it is commonly accepted that bhs are one order of magnitude less abundant than nss .",
    "this estimate comes from the critical mass for bh formation and follows if one assumes that progenitors more massive than about 35  @xmath40 ended as bhs .",
    "having dozens of snae in the close solar vicinity during the last 10 myr we can expect several bhs to have formed during the same period in the solar neighborhood .    at present , 56 runaway stars are known within @xmath28  700 pc from the sun@xcite",
    ". only a few of them result from star - star interactions , so the majority comes from snae explosions in binary systems .",
    "if the above considerations are correct we can expect about 5 bhs formed in about 50 disrupted binaries .",
    "close - by massive runaway stars give us a chance to calculate the approximate position of close - by young isolated bhs . among runaway stars the most massive are @xmath42 cep , @xmath43 pup , hip 38518 and @xmath44 per ( see hoogerwerf et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since their mass is @xmath45 @xmath40 , the companion ( actually the _ primary _ in the original binary ) was even more massive on the main sequence stage .",
    "so , the most likely product of the explosion of such a massive star should be a bh .",
    "if the present velocities of runaway stars are known , one can estimate their ages and places of birth .",
    "this has been done by hoogerwerf et al .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the present position of a bh we have to know the binary parameters , i.e. , the masses of stars before the explosion , the bh mass , the eccentricity of the orbit before the explosion , the orbit orientation , and finally the kick velocity of the bh .",
    "some parameters can be inferred from the observation of the secondary star .",
    "we can assume a zero kick velocity for bhs and zero orbital eccentricity .",
    "other parameters should be varied within assumed ranges ( see details in prokhorov and popov @xcite .",
    "we calculated approximate positions of isolated bhs for the four systems mentioned above and estimated error boxes where these bhs could be found . for @xmath44 per and @xmath43 pup",
    "we obtained not very large error boxes inside each of which only one unidentified egret source is known .",
    "we suggest that these objects can be young isolated bhs .",
    "for the two other systems ( hip 38518 and @xmath42 cep ) the present position of the bh is more uncertain and no definite conclusion on the possible detectability of the collapsed object can be drawn .",
    "we have presented evidence that the seven radio - quiet rosat isolated nss discovered so far can be connected with recent snae explosions in the gould belt . these events produced nearby runaway stars and peculiar features in the local ism including the local bubble .",
    "the relatively high local spatial density of young nss is a natural consequence of the large number of massive progenitors in the belt .",
    "the lack of a similar overabundance of active radiopulsars in the solar vicinity lends further support to the claim that a large fraction ( @xmath46 or more ) of young nss should be radio quiet . according to our results ,",
    "the rosat all sky survey may contain about a few tens of unidentified rinss .",
    "moreover , it is possible that some unidentified rinss with quite large flux ( @xmath14 cts s@xmath13 ) are still hiding at low galactic latitudes .    we also propose that massive runaway stars may be used to trace the present position of young close - by isolated bhs .",
    "our calculations allowed to estimate with reasonable accuracy the positions of four such bhs . in two cases the error box is not too large and this may lead in the future to the positive identification of an isolated bh with x / gamma - rays observations .",
