    "piperazinium hexachlorodicuprate ( c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)(cu@xmath3cl@xmath4 ) , abbreviated as phcc , was studied recently as a good test example of a two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet.@xcite inelastic neutron scattering experiments revealed that each magnetic ion interacts with at least six in - plane neighbours .",
    "the strongest exchange integral value is approximately 1.3  mev .",
    "the complex geometry of the exchange bonds can be envisioned as a set of strongly coupled antiferromagnetic ladders running along the @xmath5 axis ( from here on we use the axes notation of ref . ) of the triclinic crystal while some of the weaker exchange bonds are frustrated.@xcite the magnetic ground state of phcc is a non - magnetic singlet separated from the excited triplet states by an energy gap of @xmath6  mev .",
    "@xcite    due to the presence of the gap phcc remains in the disordered spin - liquid state down to temperatures well below the exchange integral scale . at low temperatures",
    "the magnetic properties of this system can be considered as those of a gas of weakly - interacting triplets .",
    "the application of an external field lowers the energy of one of the triplet substates and , at a certain critical field , a quantum phase transition to a field - induced antiferromagnetic state occurs .",
    "the closing of the gap and the formation of magnetic order above the critical field of @xmath7  t was confirmed by magnetic measurements as well as by calorimetric and neutron scattering techniques @xcite .",
    "additionally , this magnet was used as a test probe for the quasiparticle breakdown in a quantum spin liquid @xcite .",
    "magnetization measurements revealed an anisotropy of the critical field @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy points to deviations from the heisenberg model .",
    "such deviations are important for the physics of a spin - gap magnet , especially around the quantum phase transition .",
    "anisotropic interactions are known to cause a gap reopening in fields above the phase transition and they could also affect the quasiparticle decay by allowing otherwise forbidden processes .    in this paper we present results of electron spin resonance ( esr ) investigations of phcc .",
    "our study reveals the presence of anisotropic interactions leading to a @xmath0-factor anisotropy and a splitting in the triplet sublevels .",
    "we have determined magnitudes of these anisotropic effects and the orientations of the corresponding axes .",
    "additionally , we address the question of the correct implementation of a macroscopic theory @xcite to the case of a spin - gap magnet with a relevant @xmath0-factor anisotropy .",
    "the samples were grown from saturated solutions of phcc .",
    "the saturated solution was prepared by adding of piperazine c@xmath1h@xmath8n@xmath3 ( from sigma aldrich ) , dissolved in minimal amount of concentrated hcl to cucl@xmath9h@xmath3o ( 99.99% purity from sigma aldrich ) , dissolved in minimal amount of concentrated hcl , at a 4:1 molar ratio of cucl@xmath3 to c@xmath1h@xmath8n@xmath3 .",
    "the main set of samples for the esr measurements was grown by cooling the filtered saturated solution in the refrigerator .",
    "after several days numerous as - grown crystals have appeared and were naturally shaped as flat parallelograms of transparent orange - brown color .",
    "the typical sample size was @xmath10  mm along the longest side of the parallelogram .",
    "the crystallographic symmetry was checked by x - ray diffraction and found to be triclinic with lattice parameters and angles in agreement with the literature @xcite .",
    "the plane of the as - grown crystals was perpendicular to the @xmath11 axis of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "the long and short side of the parallelogram was parallel to the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 direction , respectively .",
    "this natural shape of the crystals allowed an easy orientation of the crystals in the magnetic field @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "additionally , a larger sample was grown from the seed by a temperature gradient method .",
    "this sample has a well developed plane normal to the @xmath11 axis and has its longest dimension parallel to @xmath12-axis . for reasons related to the sample space configuration",
    "this sample was used for measurements with @xmath15 and @xmath16 only .",
    "samples of deuterated phcc used for the specific heat measurements were grown from the seed in a similar way .",
    "the samples were characterized by static magnetization measurements with a quantum design mpms system .",
    "the concentration of impurities was estimated from the low - temperature susceptibility assuming @xmath18 and @xmath19 and was less than @xmath20 paramagnetic impurities per copper ion .",
    "the technique of electron spin resonance is a powerful tool for the study of low energy dynamics of a spin - gap magnet .",
    "it can access inter - triplet transitions and measures directly the differences between triplet sublevels .",
    "characteristic orientational , frequency - field and temperature dependences of the resonance absorption spectra provide information on anisotropic interactions , zero field splittings and the @xmath0-factor anisotropy .    in case of phcc additional complications and challenges",
    "arise from the low ( triclinic ) symmetry of the crystals . due to this low symmetry , neither the @xmath0-tensor nor the anisotropy tensor",
    "are fixed to any of the crystal axes .",
    "this means that the axes orientation for all anisotropic contributions should be considered as arbitrary and mutually independent . to solve this problem",
    "we have taken a series of absorption spectra at different temperatures and at different orientations of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the esr measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 9ghz to 120ghz and at temperatures down to 0.4  k. x - band ( 9.4  ghz ) measurements above @xmath21  k were done with a bruker elexsys spectrometer equipped with a he - flow type cryostat and an automated sample goniometer . for higher frequency measurements a set of homemade transmission type esr spectrometers equipped with @xmath22  t cryomagnets and microwave oscillators covering the frequency range up to 120  ghz were used .",
    "measurements below 1  k were performed with a home made esr spectrometer equipped with @xmath23he - pumping cryostat and a 12  t cryomagnet .",
    "low - temperature specific heat measurements in an applied magnetic field up to 14  t were performed with a quantum design ppms system equipped with a dilution refrigerator .",
    "+    the temperature evolution of the esr absorption is illustrated in figures [ fig : x - band&i ] and [ fig : scans(t ) ] . at high temperatures we observe a single - component esr absorption with a @xmath0-factor close to 2 , which is typical for cu@xmath24 ions .",
    "below approximately @xmath25  k the intensity of the resonance quickly decreases . as expected for a spin - gap magnet this decrease can be scaled with the decrease of the static susceptibility ( see right panel of figure [ fig : x - band&i ] ) .    as the intensity of the absorption decreases with cooling the absorption line broadens and ,",
    "around 5  k , it splits into several components .",
    "this splitting is anisotropic ( see right panel of figure [ fig : scans(t ) ] ) .",
    "one can distinguish several components that continue to fade out with cooling and one component , located close to a @xmath18 resonance field , with an increasing intensity upon cooling .",
    "the fading components can be ascribed to a resonance of triplet excitations , while an irregularly shaped component with increasing intensity corresponds to defects and impurities .",
    "the magnitude of the splitting is temperature dependent but appears almost constant for temperatures lower or equal to 3  k ( see figures [ fig : x - band&i ] and [ fig : scans(t ) ] ) . because of the rapid decrease of intensity of the split spectral features below 3  k we performed all measurements for the determination of the splitting parameters at 3  k.       +    above the splitting temperature where the esr absorption consists of a single component the measurements at different frequencies proved that the resonance field can be described by an effective @xmath0-factor : for @xmath15 @xmath26 , for @xmath27 @xmath28 and for @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "frequency - field diagrams for the resonance fields measured at 3.0k are shown on the figure [ fig : f(h ) ] .",
    "for all three chosen orientations the two main absorption components are located to the left and to the right of the high - temperature resonance position .",
    "another , weaker component located at approximately half of the first resonance field ( see also right panel of figure [ fig : scans(t ) ] ) was observed in the measurements with the larger sample for @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "the slope of the main components is determined by corresponding @xmath0-factor value .",
    "the splitting of these components is orientation dependent and is equal to 9.2  ghz , 5.5  ghz and 12.8  ghz for @xmath15 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 , correspondingly .",
    "+    the angular dependences of the esr absorption were accurately measured at x - band frequency ( 9.4  ghz ) for @xmath33  k ( below the splitting temperature ) and for @xmath34  k ( above the splitting temperature ) where the linewidth shows a minimum .",
    "three non - orthogonal rotation axes were chosen for different experiments , namely rotations around the @xmath11 reciprocal space axis , around the @xmath12 axis and around the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the samples were fixed with paraffine inside suprasil glass tubes , with the chosen rotation axis parallel to the tube axis .",
    "the accuracy of this sample mounting technique was limited with respect to the rotations around the tube axis and , thus , the unavoidable angle shift was later taken as a fit parameter .",
    "the positions of the resonance fields shown in figure [ fig : h(phi ) ] were determined from fitting the spectra by a single or a multi - component absorption , assuming a lorentzian shape for each of the components . for the data at 3.0  k",
    "we did not include the weak low - field component ( see the line below 0.2  t in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : x - band&i ] ) , since this line is broad and distorted in shape , which makes a precise determination of the resonance field unreliable .      to check for possible singlet - triplet transitions and antiferromagnetic resonance in the field - induced ordered phase we performed additional measurements at the temperatures down to 450  mk using the large sample with @xmath35 . at frequencies of 27  ghz and 33  ghz and for fields up to 12",
    "t we did not observe any other resonance absorption at 450  mk besides that due to defects . on heating above 1.5  k a split esr absorption , similar to that described in the above subsections , was observed .",
    "+    in order to determine the critical fields at different orientations the field dependence of the specific heat was measured at 500  mk ( figure [ fig : specheat ] ) .",
    "these measurements were done on deuterated samples of phcc while non - deuterated samples were used for esr experiments . a sharp maximum of the specific heat marks the transition to the field - induced ordered phase .",
    "the determined values of the critical fields are : for @xmath15 @xmath36 t , for @xmath37 @xmath38 t .",
    "this section is built as follows : first , we will qualitatively describe our data and will show that our observations reflect the effects of anisotropic interactions ; second , we will make a quantitative analysis of the esr data and will estimate the strength of these anisotropic interactions ; finally , we will discuss the relations between the found anisotropic properties at low field with the known anisotropic properties at the critical field .      the observed evolution of the esr absorption spectra is typical for a spin - gap magnet with triplet levels split by an effective crystal field .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed earlier for other spin - gap magnets , e.g. tlcucl@xmath39 @xcite and ntenp @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the absorption intensity with temperature corresponds to the decrease of the population numbers of gapped excitations . at high temperature",
    "the population numbers are high and excited quasiparticles interact with each other switching on the exchange narrowing mechanism .",
    "this causes a single resonance line observed at high temperature . at low temperatures excitations are rare and can be considered as a gas of noninteracting quasiparticles .",
    "hence , their spectrum can be affected by anisotropic interactions , which can be described as an effective crystal field acting on @xmath40 quasiparticles .",
    "these interactions lift the degeneracy of the triplet sublevels at @xmath41 , causing splitting of the thermoactivated esr absorption spectrum into several components .",
    "this effect is similar to the well known splitting of energy levels of an @xmath40 ion in a crystal @xcite . the line broadening marks a crossover from the high - temperature , exchange - narrowed limit to the low - temperature single - particle limit .    besides the thermoactivated esr absorption which is caused by the resonance transitions between triplet sublevels an observation of singlet - triplet transitions or an antiferromagnetic resonance above the critical field could be possible .",
    "both of these transitions were observed in the above - mentioned spin - gap systems tlcucl@xmath39 and ntenp .",
    "however , the intensity of the dipolar singlet - triplet transition should be zero in the exchange approximation .",
    "thus the observation of this transition should require in particular a symmetry - breaking of the ground state by anisotropic interactions .",
    "the absence of the singlet - triplet transition in our experiment shows that the coupling of these states is small .",
    "the absence of the resonance absorption in the field induced ordered phase even up to 12 t at 450mk ( at @xmath42 t @xmath43 @xcite ) provides 30ghz ( or 0.15mev ) as an upper estimate of the gap .",
    "+    different models are used for the description of the low energy dynamics of a spin gap magnet in magnetic field .",
    "a fermionic field - theory model was proposed for 1d systems by tsvelik @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a bosonic field - theory model was proposed by affleck @xcite and later independently developed as a macroscopic model by farutin @xcite .",
    "particular systems can be treated by microscopic approaches @xcite .",
    "however , only close to the critical field the differences of all these models become important .",
    "since we can not observe singlet - triplet transitions on phcc , we can not look for these fine differences and can not reliably judge on the applicability of different models from the esr data alone . on the other hand",
    ", since our data correspond to the low - field limit ( the critical field is around 8  t , while all x - band resonance modes are below 1  t and most of the higher frquency data are below 4  t ) we can apply a perturbative approach for the description of the observed esr data .",
    "it will yield the values of zero - field splitting of the energy levels and the orientations of all relevant anisotropy axes which can be used , if necessary , to obtain parameters of other models .",
    "this approach considers triplet excitations for a non - interacting @xmath40 particle moving in a stationary effective crystal field .",
    "the effective spin hamiltonian for this particle is :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is an energy gap , @xmath46 is a @xmath0-tensor , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the effective anisotropy parameters and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the anisotropy axes .",
    "due to the triclinic crystal symmetry the orientation of the anisotropy axes @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is arbitrary with respect to the crystal .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-tensor axes @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are also arbitrary with respect both to the crystal and to the anisotropy axes .",
    "we neglect here the @xmath55-dependence of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 , since at low temperatures only the bottom of the spectrum is populated , while at high temperatures the exchange narrowing cancels out the effects of these terms .",
    "the perturbative model can be solved for eigenenergies for any given magnetic field .",
    "the differences of the eigenenergies will correspond to the resonance frequencies which can then be compared with the experiment .",
    "we used a standard least - squares routine to minimize the model deviation from the experimental data .",
    "angular dependences of the x - band resonance fields at 3  k and 25  k were used for the determination of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "additionally , the values of the @xmath0-factor and the low - temperature splittings measured in the high - frequency experiments with well - defined sample orientation were used as anchors to correct for the angle shifts due to the sample mounting . the basis @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 was selected to describe the orientation of the @xmath0-tensor and the anisotropy axes with respect to the crystal ( figure [ fig : model axes ] ) .",
    "this problem has 14 parameters : the anisotropy constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the euler angles of the anisotropy axes @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , three main values of the @xmath0-tensor , the euler angles of the @xmath0-tensor axes , and , finally , three uncontrolled shift angles @xmath64 in the x - band rotation experiments .",
    "it turned out , that this general fit yields two of the @xmath0-tensor components very close to each other ( best fit @xmath0-factor values 2.272 , 2.062 and 2.039 ) . consequently , the fit became unstable and could not well distinguish the orientations of the @xmath0-tensor differing by rotation around high-@xmath0-value axis .",
    "thus , we reduced the number of model parameters to 12 by assuming an axial @xmath0-tensor that can be described by two main values and by two polar angles of the @xmath0-tensor axis .",
    "the stability of the best fit solution was confirmed by running numerous fitting procedures with randomly varied initial approximations of the model parameters .",
    ".best fit parameters in the perturbative model.[tab : bestfit ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     our specific heat measurement and earlier measurements of other authors demonstrate the anisotropy of the critical field of about 1  t ( see table [ tab : compare ] ) .",
    "additionally , neutron scattering experiments @xcite have determined the orientation of the order parameter above the critical field for @xmath65 : the order parameter was found to lie within @xmath66 of the @xmath67 plane with an in - plane component within @xmath68 of the @xmath69-axis .",
    "both of these effects are determined by the anisotropic interactions in the spin system and thus provide an independent check for the anisotropy parameters found above .",
    "the critical field depends strongly on temperature : its values at 65mk and at 2.8k differ by @xmath70 t @xcite .",
    "thus , it is necessary to ascertain whether the anisotropy parameters determined at 3.0k can be used in the analysis of the low temperature data or not .",
    "the temperature dependence of the critical field originates from the renormalization of the energy spectrum due to the repulsive interaction of triplet excitations .",
    "this renormalization depends on the triplet population numbers and therefore affects strongly the energy spectrum in the vicinity of the critical field , where the energy gap is small .",
    "our esr measurements , on the contrary , were performed in small fields where the energy gap value is still high and the triplet population numbers are small even at 3.0k .",
    "this is confirmed by the experimental observation that the observed splitting of the resonance absorption does not change significantly at further cooling below 3k .",
    "therefore , the effect of triplet repulsion does not affect the values of anisotropy parameters found in the previous subsection and these values can be used for the analysis of the low temperature data for the critical field anisotropy and order parameter orientation .    in the model calculations of this subsection",
    "we will use @xmath0-factor values and ( when necessary ) zero - field splittings as determined in our esr experiments . since the gap value @xmath45 can not be determined with the similar precision",
    ", we will tune it to obtain correct value of the critical field in the chosen orientation .",
    "we choose the value of the field at which the antiferromagnetic bragg reflection appears @xcite at @xmath65 ( @xmath71 t ) as the most reliable anchor for this purpose .",
    "first , there is a simplest model , suggested in ref .",
    ", that treats the anisotropy of the critical field as originating from the @xmath0-factor anisotropy only .",
    "this model was backed by the observation that the ratios of the critical field to the saturation field were found to be the same in different orientations .",
    "the values of the @xmath0-factor in the particular orientations of the magnetic field calculated from our model are given in table [ tab : compare ] .",
    "one can see that the highest critical field is indeed observed in the direction with the smallest @xmath0-value ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the critical field in the arbitrary orientation can be expressed via the @xmath0-factor value as @xmath72 .",
    "the calculated values are in reasonable agreement with the experiment ( see table [ tab : compare ] ) .    however , this simple model is not exact , since we observe zero - field splitting of energy levels .",
    "the effect of zero - field splitting on the anisotropy of the critical field can be roughly estimated from the value of the main anisotropy constant as @xmath73 t .",
    "this has to be compared with the effects of the @xmath0-tensor anisotropy : @xmath74 t .",
    "these values are similar and , especially since the axes of anisotropy and the axes of @xmath0-tensor do not coincide , it is not possible to neglect _ a priori _ one of the effects for an arbitrary field direction .    as a second test model",
    ", we extrapolate the results of the perturbative model up to the critical field .",
    "this extrapolation can be justified only for one - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "however , this model can be considered as a simple approximation taking into account both the effects of @xmath0-tensor anisotropy and zero - field splitting of triplet sublevels .",
    "the results of this extrapolation are also collected in table [ tab : compare ] .",
    "finally , the problem of the triplet level field dependence can be treated more strictly within the frameworks of a macroscopic ( bosonic ) approach@xcite .",
    "this model treats the excitations of a spin - gap magnet as oscillations of the vector field @xmath75 with the lagrangian    @xmath76\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{2}a{\\boldsymbol\\eta}^2+{\\cal{l}}_{rel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is the exchange constant describing the energy gap , @xmath78 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath79 is a term containing anisotropic relativistic corrections .",
    "the leading corrections terms at low fields are the effective anisotropy terms , responsible for the zero field splitting , which can be written in the reference frame of anisotropy axes @xmath80 :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 are the effective anisotropy constants .",
    "these terms allow to describe the zero field splitting , see e.g. ref ..    to describe additional field effects we have to include here next order terms .",
    "the low symmetry of the crystal allows numerous relativistic and exchange - relativistic invariants such as @xmath83 , @xmath84_\\alpha h_\\beta$ ] , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 etc .",
    "i.e. , in general we have to consider a veritable zoo of possible terms which overburdens the problem beyond any hope to produce a compact solution .",
    "to simplify this problem we will assume that the main field effects arise from a single - ion @xmath0-tensor anisotropy . thus , due to an almost tetragonal local symmetry , these effects can be considered as having an axial symmetry in the @xmath0-tensor reference frame .",
    "additionally , we will require that for the model test case of @xmath88 these terms should provide linear e(h ) dependences for all three modes , which is natural for the microscopic model with anisotropic single - ion @xmath0-tensor only .",
    "this leads to the following invariants combination :    @xmath89_{z_g})\\ ] ]    where the parameter @xmath90 reflects the @xmath0-factor anisotropy .",
    "up to higher order corrections , equation ( [ eqn : lagr - rel2 ] ) is equal to the replacement of the problem with an anisotropic @xmath0-tensor @xmath91 and a certain real field direction @xmath14 by the formally equivalent problem with the isotropic @xmath0-factor @xmath92 and a transformed `` effective '' field @xmath93 .",
    "three terms in eqn.([eqn : lagr - rel2 ] ) are responsible for different effects and none can be omitted .",
    "the dynamics equations can be obtained from the final lagrangian @xmath94 using a standard variational technique with special attention to the frames of reference ( see appendix ) .",
    "the solution of these equations yields the field dependences of the energy levels , whose differences would yield transition frequencies",
    ". the parameters of the macroscopic model can be directly expressed via perturbative model parameters with only one adjustable parameter @xmath45 :    @xmath95    here @xmath96ghz / koe is a free electron gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the factors of @xmath97 or @xmath98 appears here since the dynamics equations ( [ eqn : dyneqn ] ) are written for angular frequency @xmath99 , while the parameters of the perturbative model were expressed in the ordinary frequency units .",
    "the parameters values corresponding to @xmath100 t are : @xmath101  1/sec@xmath102 , @xmath103  1/sec@xmath102 , @xmath104  1/sec@xmath102 , @xmath105ghz / koe , @xmath106 .",
    "we have found that the model curves fits our data perfectly and are undistinguishable from the perturbative curves at low fields .",
    "the predicted values of critical fields are also gathered in the table [ tab : compare ] .",
    "the macroscopic model allows a straightforward analysis of the order parameter orientation above the critical field .",
    "we have to add to the final lagrangian fourth order exchange term @xmath107 which will determine the magnitude of the order parameter at @xmath108.@xcite however , as long as all anisotropic terms are of the same order in @xmath75 , the orientation of the order parameter does not depend on its amplitude and , consequently , does not depend on the value of the exchange constant @xmath109 .",
    "thus , for the sake of determining the order parameter orientation only , the @xmath109 constant can be simply thought of as a mathematical meaning to exclude the divergence of the order parameter above @xmath110 . using the model parameters described above we have found that the polar angles of order parameter at @xmath65 are @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this corresponds to an angle of 16@xmath113 with the @xmath67-plane and to an angle of 28@xmath113 to the @xmath69-axis .",
    "the in - plane component of the calculated order parameter forms an angle of @xmath114 with the @xmath69-axis .",
    "although there is a qualitative agreement , the calculated values differ from those found in the experiment @xcite .",
    "all of the models provide a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "the macroscopic model seems to be physically the most justified , since it describes correctly the zero - field structure of energy levels and can be applied up to the critical field and above .",
    "quantitative disagreements with the experiment can be caused by some neglected factors : the slight change of anisotropy constants at cooling below 3k or the effects of additional anisotropic contributions above @xmath110 .",
    "a detailed investigation of the low - energy spin dynamics in the spin - gap magnet phcc revealed the presence of anisotropic interactions causing a splitting of the triplet sublevels and leading to a @xmath0-tensor anisotropy .",
