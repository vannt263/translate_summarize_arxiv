    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by wmap ( bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel 2003 ; peiris 2003 ) are in good agreement with a ` concordance ' cosmology based on the model .",
    "however , the wmap results also confirm the low amplitude of the cmb quadrupole first measured by cobe ( eg hinshaw 1996a ) . as bennett ( 2003 )",
    "comment , the amplitudes of the quadrupole and the octopole are low compared with the predictions of models .",
    "the wmap team also present a convincing case that the low cmb multipoles are not significantly affected by foreground galactic emission ( see also tegmark , de oliveira - costa and hamilton 2003 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the observations and the model is particularly evident in the temperature angular correlation function , which shows an almost complete lack of signal on angular scales @xmath11 degrees . according to spergel ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the probability of finding such a result in a spatially - flat cosmology is about @xmath12 .",
    "this is small enough to require an explanation , e.g. in the form of new physics @xcite or in terms of spatial curvature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the wmap data from the point of view of the two - point angular correlation function as opposed to the usual harmonic decomposition . in some aspects",
    "our approach is similar to the study presented by hinshaw ( 1996b ) for the cobe data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce our methodology and test it with realistic simulations . in ",
    "3 we apply our method to the real wmap data and present a comparison with the simulations .",
    "we also describe the application of higher - order statistics to test the gaussianity of wmap .",
    "the conclusions are described in  4 .",
    "on the largest scales , the 2-point correlation @xmath13 has some important advantages and disadvantages over spherical harmonics .",
    "the overall shape of the 2-point function is very sensitive to small differences in power at low multipoles .",
    "this is clearly an advantage when measuring the quadrupole . on the other hand , different bins in @xmath14",
    "are highly correlated , which means that we need to use the full covariance matrix to assess the significance of any departures between measurements and models .",
    "another important advantage of using the 2-point function is that large - scale modes can be easily sampled from any region of the sky , even when a mask is required , provided the region is large enough . in comparison , harmonic decomposition breaks the angular symmetry in the sky into orthogonal bases which have an arbitrary phase orientation .",
    "this is not a problem in the case of full sky coverage , but the results will be coordinate - dependent if a mask is used .",
    "moreover , the harmonic coefficients @xmath15 ( see eq.[harmdec ] ) over masked data are convolved with the harmonic image of the mask .",
    "the resulting coupling matrix needs to be inverted and the resulting estimator for the recovered coefficients is typically biased because of the non - linear transformations involved .",
    "these potential complications are avoided in configuration space .",
    "the 2-point angular correlation function is defined as the expectation value or mean cross - correlation of density fluctuations at two positions @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the sky : w_2 ( ) , where @xmath18 , assuming that the distribution is statistically isotropic .    to estimate @xmath13 from the pixel maps we use a simple but effective estimator : w_2 ( ) = _ i , j _ i _ j  w_i  w_j , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the temperature differences in the map and the sum extends to all pairs separated by @xmath21 .",
    "the differences are normalised so that @xmath22 .",
    "the weights @xmath23 can be used to minimise the variance when the pixel noise is not uniform , but this introduces larger cosmic variance . here",
    "we follow the wmap team and use uniform weights ( i.e. @xmath24 ) .",
    "we use bins @xmath25 whose size is proportional to the square root of the angle @xmath14 .    this estimator is unbiased and is equivalent to the minimum variance estimator of landy & szalay ( 1993 ) . for higher - order moments",
    "see  3.6 .",
    "temperature fluctuations can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics according to ,    t ( ) = _",
    "= 0^_m=-^ a_m y_^m ( ) , which defines the multipole power spectrum : @xmath26 .",
    "gaussian simulations can then be made by taking @xmath27 to be independent gaussian fields with random phases , zero mean and variance @xmath0 .    in order to test the significance of the correlations measured in the wmap data , we make simulated sky maps by using the best - fit cosmological parameters estimated from wmap ( spergel _ et al .",
    "the theoretical power spectra are generated using the publicly available cmbfast package ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath0s are normalised to the cobe spectra and the input parameters are listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "along with cosmological parameters , cmbfast accepts a reionization optical depth , @xmath28 , and the scalar spectral index , @xmath29 . from now on we refer to this particular set of paramenters as the model .",
    "figure [ cl.eps ] shows the resulting power spectrum for the model . in the model",
    "the first three non - zero multipoles are ( in @xmath8 ) : c_2=1130 ,  c_3=537 ,  c_4=304 , while bennett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find from wmap data : c_2 & = & 129 799 + c_3 & = & 320 320 + c_4 & = & 316 104 .",
    ".cmbfast cosmological parameters [ tab : table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     using the method described in the previous section , we compare the wmap to different models in table [ tab : chisq ] .",
    "the second row shows how considering the wmap data as a realization of the model gives a very good fit ( 62% c.l . ) .",
    "however , considering the wmap jackknife errors ( i.e. first row in table2 ) leads to a vanishing probability for the model , as was already hinted at in fig.[w2vmapwm ] .",
    "on the other hand , the wmap data provides a resonable fit to the low - q models , even if we use the wmap errors , as can be seen from the third , fourth and fifth row of table [ tab : chisq30 ] .",
    "the wmap data clearly has a low quadrupole compared to as was already suggested by figure 13 .",
    "considering only the wmap data at @xmath30 deg , and comparing the resulting @xmath13 to the models , give similar results as can be seen in table [ tab : chisq30 ] .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with that found by cobe ( kogut 1996 ) .",
    "the above results are obtained with a relatively small number of simulations ( 40 for and 20 for low - q model ) and also a small number of jackknife subsamples ( 16 ) .",
    "thus , although these estimates probably give the right order of magnitude for the calculation we can not expect them to be very accurate .",
    "we next quantify what are the errors involved by repeating the analysis with an increasing number of simulations , from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , to calculate the covariance matrix .",
    "we can also check with these additional simulations if the @xmath33 distribution gives an accurate representation of the probabilities .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[chi2hist ] , which shows the histogram of @xmath33 values obtained for each realization using a direct inversion of the covariance matrix ( no svd ) , estimated from @xmath34 realizations .",
    "the histogram matches well the probabilities given by the @xmath33 distribution .",
    "moreover we find that , other than poisson errors , the values are quite insensitive to the total number @xmath35 of simulations used .",
    "the probability of finding a simulation with a @xmath33 value larger than wmap seems to converge to @xmath36 .",
    "this number compares well to the crude @xmath37 estimate we found in table [ tab : chisq ] using svd over 40 simulations .",
    "if we used 20 or 100 simulations with svd we find intermediate results .",
    "we have also estimated the @xmath33 values for @xmath32 simulations using the wmap jacknife covariance matrix .",
    "we find that none of the @xmath32 simulations have a @xmath33 smaller than wmap ( the smaller value in the 2000 simulations is @xmath38 for 36 bins in ) .",
    "thus the probability for given the wmap errors is @xmath39% , in good agreement with first entry in table [ tab : chisq ] .",
    "2.5 truein      using the previously discussed method ( see  2.11 ) of calculating the @xmath33 with the svd , we can recover the @xmath0s from the data by requiring that @xmath33 has a minimum .",
    "fitting three multipoles ( @xmath40 and @xmath3 ) of a model to the wmap data and using the errors yields c_2=-7  c_3=190  c_4=226 . with the jacknife wmap errors we get c_2=123  c_3=217  c_4=212 . comparing with eq .",
    "[ eq : cls ] , we see that the best fit value has a negligible quadrupole and an octopole that is roughly half the value of the model .",
    "even the @xmath3 is somewhat lower than the value .",
    "the low - q model is hence a better approximation to the measured from the wmap data .",
    "3.4 truein    the confidence contours of the @xmath0s are plotted in fig .",
    "[ wmapconts ] for the wmap errors for the two sets of pairs @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the figure fully confirms our expectations : the wmap data is in good agreement with when wmap data is considered a realization of the model ( i.e. using errors ) .",
    "the wmap data is not in agreement with however when using wmap errors .    from the confidence plots we can recover the @xmath43 c. l. ( or @xmath44-sigma ) limits for the @xmath0s by considering the projections of the contours on the axes .",
    "when no model is assumed , i.e. we use wmap errors , we find ( in @xmath8 ) : c_2 & = & 123 233 + c_3 & = & 217 241 + c_4 & = & 212 162 , which are shown as closed triangles in fig.[cl.eps ] . with a covariance matrix",
    "the errors are much larger ( in @xmath8 ) , c_2 & = & -7 1568 + c_3 & = & 190 799 + c_4 & = & 226 339 , compared to eq.[eq : wmap2003cls ] , our errors are about a factor of two larger .",
    "2.2 truein      we also present the higher - order moments of the 2-point correlations in wmap .",
    "this provides a consistency test for the gaussian hypothesis , which is implied in the comparison with simulations .",
    "the higher - order moments of the 2-point function can be defined as : k_pq ( ) where @xmath45 corresponds to the 2-point function in eq.[[w2def ] ] , i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 gives the 1-point moments , e.g. @xmath48 is the variance and @xmath49 is the skewness .",
    "it is then useful to define 2-point cumulants as _ connected _ moments , subtracting the lower - order contributions ( e.g. see gaztaaga , fosalba & croft 2002 ) : w_11 ( ) & & w_2 ( ) k_11 ( ) + w_12 ( ) & & k_12 ( ) + w_13 ( ) & & k_13 ( ) -3 k_11(0 )  k_11 ( ) + w_14 ( ) & & k_14 ( ) -6 k_11(0 )  k_12 ( ) -4 k_12(0 )  k_11 ( ) for a gaussian field we expect @xmath50 .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate these higher - order moments in the same way in which we have calculated the 2-point function : k_pq ( ) = _ i , j _",
    "i^p _ j^q  w_i^p  w_j^q . here ,",
    "as in calculating the 2-point function , uniform weights , @xmath24 , are used .",
    "we have estimated the higher order moments as well as the covariance matrix both from wmap and simulated data .",
    "figure [ w14 ] shows @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the wmap v - band data and the combined foreground clean map in tegmark et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with a galactic cut excluding @xmath54 ( long dashed line ) . also shown",
    "are the 68% cl in the dispersion from the low - q simulations .",
    "both wmap and the combined map with @xmath55 agree well with the gaussian hypothesis @xmath56 at high significance .    for the 3rd order moment , @xmath51 , we also show the combined clean map without the galactic cut ( short - dashed line ) .",
    "this result is incompatible with the gaussian low - q simulations ( and covariance matrix ) on small angular scales , @xmath57 deg .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement to what chiang ( 2003 ) have recently found using phase correlators over the very same map .",
    "nevertheless , we note how this apparent discrepancy goes away when we exclude the @xmath54 galactic region .",
    "thus , this non - gaussian feature seems to be related to residual galaxy contamination , which is visually apparent in the image of the combined clean map ( e.g. see fig . 1 in tegmark et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "our best constraints on non - gaussian features come from the 4th - order statistic , @xmath52 , because in this case the pixel noise at two different points would tend to cancel out , as in the 2nd - order moment @xmath58 .",
    "this is not the case for the 3rd and 5th - order moments , @xmath51 or @xmath52 , where pixel noise is added in quadrature .",
    "one needs to consider multi - point correlations to reduce the noise contribution and get better constraints on non - gaussian models , which is beyond the scope of this paper ( see hinshaw 1995 , komatsu 2003 ) .",
    "the point here is that the higher - order 2-point anisotropies in wmap are perfectly compatible with the gaussian hypothesis , given the pixel noise .",
    "we find similar results up to 8th - order moments .",
    "in this paper we have studied the lowest - order multipoles in the cmb from recent wmap data .",
    "this work is motivated by the fact that the low order multipoles , and especially the quadrupole as measured in harmonic space , show less power than that expected in the standard model ( e.g. see bennett 2003 ; spergel 2003 ; peiris 2003 ) . instead of looking at the power spectrum , we study the wmap data by using the two - point angular correlation function , , as a tool to estimate the multipoles .",
    "the main advantage is that is very sensitive to the low order multipoles the main disadvantage is that different bins of are highly correlated so a covariance analysis is required .",
    "we have simulated a set of v - band maps with different random phases using the best - fit wmap power spectra and pixel errors , and calculate the 2-point function for each model . using this set of simulations we calculate the mean value and variance at each bin as well as the covariance matrix .",
    "the errors and the covariance matrix of the wmap data is calculated by using the jacknife method . a model with a zero quadrupole and",
    "a low octopole is also simulated and used to test the reliability of the jacknife errors .    using a @xmath33 test with a covariance matrix",
    "we calculate the significance of the wmap data in different models . it is found that indeed , the wmap data with the wmap errors does not fit the model and is strongly disfavoured .",
    "instead , the wmap data fits well the low - q model with a vanishing quadrupole .",
    "however , taking a different point of view and considering the wmap data as a sample realization of the simulated maps , we find that the wmap results are fully consistent with the model . from this viewpoint",
    ", our sky just happens to have a low quadrupole and is just as likely to have a large quadrupole as demonstrated by the different realizations in figure [ wmaps ] .",
    "our results are in apparent contradiction with the harmonic space analysis presented by spergel ( 2003 ) , which gives wmap a probability as low as @xmath59 of being a realization of the model .",
    "in contrast we estimate this probability to be @xmath36 comparing in wmap to in 1000 realizations ( see fig.[chi2hist ] ) .",
    "our probability is closer , but still larger than the @xmath60 value obtained from harmonic analysis by tegmark etal ( 2003 ) , also using direct harmonic analysis . ]",
    "why are all these estimates so different ? to answer this question we conduct a further test by repeating our calculation using a different galactic mask .",
    "we use a sharp cut in galactic latitude @xmath61 of about @xmath62 degrees , excluding the same number of pixels as the kp0 mask .",
    "we then recalculate the covariance matrix and its inversion with this new galactic cut over the same 1000 realizations .",
    "we repeat the @xmath33 analysis ( in fig.[chi2hist ] ) for wmap and the 1000 simulations with this new covariance matrix .",
    "we find that only @xmath63 of the simulations with this galactic cut have a @xmath33 larger than the one measured for wmap .",
    "thus the final probability depends strongly on the shape of the mask , and therefore on how the mask is accounted for in the comparison between the models and observations .",
    "this is not surprising because the large scale modes that determine the shape of ( eg fig.[w2low ] ) extend over angular regions that are comparable to the mask . to recover the low order multipoles from masked data using harmonic decomposition",
    ", one needs to invert the convolution with the harmonic image of the mask .",
    "this is a non - linear transformation that is likely to introduce biases in the recovered low multipoles .",
    "we speculate that the origin of the above discrepancies with the harmonic analysis could depend on how the mask is taken into account on the different estimators . because the estimator is independant of the mask we believe that our @xmath4 probability value is reliable .",
    "one can also recover the values of the low multipoles from the wmap estimations .",
    "the validity of the method is demonstrated by recovering known @xmath0s from a set of simulated data .",
    "again , we find that the best fit model has a low quadrupole as well as a small octopole .",
    "confidence levels in the @xmath0 plane point to a similar conclusion : the wmap data fits the model , but only with priors .",
    "we can also reach a similar conclusion by asking how many of the first 100 simulations show a 2-point function that `` looks '' closer to the wmap data than to @xmath58 ( e.g. see figure[w2vmapwm2 ] ) .",
    "there is a clear distinction of such cases , which is even apparent by a direct inspection of the pixel - map images ( see figure [ wmaps ] ) .",
    "we find at least 15 similar examples of low quadrupole amongst the first 100 simulations , confirming our more quantitative analysis above .",
    "we have also considered the presence of possible non - gaussianities in the wmap data by calculating higher - order moments of the 2-point correlation .",
    "we find that both the wmap and combined foreground clean map of tegmark et al .",
    "( 2003 ) at @xmath55 are in excellent agreement with the gaussian hypothesis .",
    "it is also shown how the full - sky foreground clean map ( i.e. including @xmath54 ) shows a non - gaussian feature at angular scales @xmath64 degrees , indicating a possible residual galaxy contamination in the map .    in summary ,",
    "the low value of the wmap quadrupole is confirmed here by looking at the two - point angular correlation function , , which is shown to be a well - suited method for the study of low multipoles in the cmb data .",
    "this does not necessarily indicate a need for new physics or non - standard cosmology , since we also show the wmap fits well a standard cosmology if one considers our universe as a realization of the set of possible outcomes .",
    "we stress nevertheless , that by considering the errors from the wmap data alone , i.e. with the jacknife errors , in wmap is strongly inconsistent with the mean model and , under such an assumption , new ideas to explain the discrepancy could well be in order . finally , we have demonstrated that our conclusions are robust when we exclude data with galactic latitudes @xmath9 , which indicates that the information ( or lack of information ) in the galactic plane is not responsible for the missing large scale power .",
