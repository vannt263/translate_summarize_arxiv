    "in 1907 , s. bla@xmath0ko described the cyclic variation of the pulsation period of rw dra , without comments on the amplitude behaviour , ( bla@xmath0ko 1907 ) , and in 1916 , h. shapley reported cyclic variations in the shape of the light curve , period and amplitude in the star rr lyrae ( shapley 1916 ) .",
    "period oscillation and/or amplitude modulation in rr lyrae type stars is generally referred to as the bla@xmath0ko or blazhko effect . over the last hundred years",
    "numerous rr lyrae stars have been found to exhibit cyclic modulations of both period and amplitude although cases of amplitude modulations with no period variations are common .",
    "the cause of these modulations has remained unsatisfactorily explained on theoretical grounds .",
    "this is not surprising since , to detect and characterize the variations , even in the cases with large amplitude modulations , large sets of accurate photometric observations obtained over a long time span are required .",
    "most recently , as a result of careful inspection of large data bases ( e.g. moskalik & poretti et al . 2003 ( ogle ) ; kolenberg et al . 2010 ( @xmath1 ) ) , the detection of the blazhko effect in rr lyrae stars has improved .",
    "long term surveys have proven useful in the detection of very small amplitude modulations , increasing the fraction of known blazhko variables among the fundamental pulsators rrab ( rr0 ) to about 50% ( e.g. the konkoly blazhko survey ; jurcsik et al .",
    "2009 ) and have also allowed detailed studies of individual objects ( e.g. chadid et al .",
    "2010a ( v1127 aql ) ; chadid et al .",
    "2010b ( s arae ) ; poretti et al . 2010 ( corot 101128793 ) ; kolenberg et al . 2011 ( rr lyr ) ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : timax - e ]",
    "precise , dense , and long time - span time - series photometry is required to detect amplitude and phase modulations in rr lyrae variables .",
    "if this is achieved , then one may find that the blazhko effect is more common than generally realized , particularly among the first overtone pulsators or rrc stars .",
    "the significant increase in the detections of blazhko variables in ngc  5024 is mainly due to the high quality of the ccd photometry achieved using the dia technique which enables one to detect small amplitude and phase modulations .",
    "the accuracy of our @xmath2 photometry at the brightness of the rr lyrae stars is about 0.008 mag per data point , which is , in most of the confirmed blazhko variables , significantly smaller than the amplitude of the modulations in the light curves .",
    "our data reveal that amplitude and phase modulations are present in the majority of the light curves of the rrc stars ( 23 of 31 ) and in about half of the rrab stars ( 11 of 24 ) in ngc 5024 , i.e. 66% and 37% respectively .",
    "we also find a lower limit of 52% on the overall incidence rate of the blazhko effect among the rr lyrae population of the cluster , a fraction which may increase as more extensive time - series ccd photometry becomes available .",
    "it is likely times of maximum o - c residuals observed in blazhko variables are caused by the phase modulations . given the short time base of our observations we can not say whether or not these o - c differences are at all connected with secular variations in the pulsation period .",
    "the rrab and rrc stars are cleanly separated in the cmd which is the expected situation if the evolution of the rr lyrae stars is progressing towards the red . in the prevailing hysteresis paradigm ,",
    "the current pulsation mode of an rr lyrae star is defined by its previous evolutionary history ( e.g. , van albada & baker 1973 ; caputo et al .",
    "1978 ) . as schematically shown in fig . 3 of caputo et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , one only expects to find a clean separation between rrab and rrc stars if horizontal branch evolution is predominantly towards the red in the instability strip .",
    "at the same time , the color distribution of the blazhko rrc variables is redder than that of the stable counterparts , and populate the hysteresis region where first overtone and fundamental pulsators may coexist .",
    "this may suggest that the blazhko effect manifests in stars undergoing a pulsation mode change .",
    "our limited time coverage of the blazhko cycle prevented us from estimating the modulation periods . despite of this the light curve modulations",
    "could be detected with confidence .",
    "a continued monitoring of ngc  5024 should prove useful in characterizing the modulation properties of the confirmed and suspected blazhko stars , in particular the determination of the modulation frequencies .",
    "the large sample of blazhko variables in ngc  5024 will eventually be used to confirm the existance of the correlation between the main pulsation frequency @xmath3 and the modulation frequency @xmath4 , sketched for the blazhko rrab stars in m5 ( jurcsik et al .",
    "2011 ) and whether the zero point is metallicity dependent .",
    "comprehensive studies of the blazhko - modulated stars in globular clusters might enable us to study metallicity and stellar evolution effects in rr lyrae stars and infer incidence rates of the blazhko modulation in homogeneous populations .",
    "we are greatful to the referee for multiple constructive comments and suggestions .",
