    "why each particular star reaches a certain level of activity , and why seemingly similar stars may have drastically different chromospheres ? it is believed that differential rotation and convection are the key factors responsible for the magnetic activity in the star . a significant fraction of stellar population , especially at later evolutionary stages , is found in close binaries , where tidal forces and mass transfer become additional factors controlling rotation and atmospheric properties of companions .    in order to understand the physical origin of activity , the time - scale of variability , and to be able to extrapolate to other systems",
    ", we initiated a multiwavelengh optical survey of a large sample of binaries with various levels of activity .",
    "we carried out the study of the chromosphere of active binary systems using the information provided by several optical and near infrared spectroscopic features that are formed at different heights in the chromosphere ( see montes et al . 1997 , 1998 , 2000 ;",
    "glvez et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ) , and applied it to several known and newly discovered binaries , most of which are by dra or rs cvn type with various levels of activity .",
    "the ultimate goal of the project is to establish a reliable activity - rotation relation in binary stars . to achieve high accuracy one needs to investigate all possible causes of activity for each particular system and for each component in the system .",
    "it is essential to take into consideration dispersion and signal - to - noise of the spectral data obtained with different instrumental set - ups .",
    "furthermore , the study of binaries as compared to single stars is complicated by the interaction between companions , line blending ( sb2 case ) , reflected light , etc .",
    "active stars , which are recognized by the presence of emission lines in one or both components , present the most challenging case and need to be studied on the individual basis . to obtain an accurate orbital solution and to study the behavior of activity , one needs to separate radial velocities , equivalent widths ( @xmath3 hereafter ) of emission lines , and fluxes between two components .",
    "it is also vital to carry out a precise stellar classification due to the importance of the subgiant and giant presence in the activity - rotation relation ( e.g. in rs cvn case ) .",
    "here we concentrate on two recently discovered , x - ray / euv selected , chromospherically active double - line spectroscopic binaries included in this survey : v789  mon ( 2re j0725 - 002 , bd-00 1712 ) and gz  leo ( 2re j1101 + 223 , hd  95559 , bd+23 2297 , hip 53923 ) .",

    "strassmeier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) determined a period of 2.944 days from their photometric observations , but noted that a period of 1.514 days was also possible . finally , fekel & henry ( 2000 ) and pandey et al .",

    "starmod allows to rotationally broaden spectra and shift them in the velocity space .",
    "we ran it on the spectra of the reference stars and combined with the appropriate weights to create composite spectra that were used as template for comparison with our targets .    for v789  mon we obtained the best fit between observed and synthetic spectra using a k5v reference star ( ) for both components , contributing respectively 60% and 40% of the total flux in the continuum .",
    "the fits were carried out in all the phases where the spectra of the components could be separated .",

    "our spectral classification is very close to the k2v type reported by popper ( 1996 ) and the k1v type by fekel & henry ( 2000 ) .",
    "jeffries et al . ( 1995 ) estimated the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath1 ) for v789  mon as 25kms@xmath5 . for gz  leo they found 27 kms@xmath5 , while fekel & henry ( 2000 ) reported values of 32.4 and 31.6 kms@xmath5 for each component .",

    "the method is described in detail in our previous papers ( see glvez et al . 2002 ; lpez - santiago et al .",
    "2003 ) . in short ,",
    "the method is based on the fact that when a stellar spectrum with rotationally broadened lines is cross - correlated against a narrow - line spectrum , the width of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) will depend on the amount of rotational broadening of the former spectrum .    for v789  mon",

    "heliocentric radial velocities were also obtained by using the cross - correlation technique ( see e.g. glvez et al .",
    "the spectra of the target were cross - correlated order by order , using the routine fxcor in iraf , against spectra of radial velocity standards with similar spectral type taken from beavers et al .",
    "we derived the radial velocity for each order from the position of peak of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) and calculated the uncertainties based on the fitted peak height and the antisymmetric noise as described by tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "since both systems are sb2 , we could see two peaks in the ccf associated with two components ; we fitted each peak separately .",

    "we note that the uncertainties returned by fxcor for sb2 binaries are overestimated ; when fitting each component , the presence of the other component will increase the antisymmetric noise , thereby biasing the error .    to compute the orbital solution for these systems we combined our radial velocity data ( for both components ) with the data of jeffries et al .",

    "we arrived at a similar conclusions for gz  leo : a nearly circular orbit ( @xmath31 ) with an orbital period of 1.5260 days , which is very similar to the photometric rotational period ( @xmath14 @xmath7 1.5264 days , fekel & henry 2000 ) , indicating a synchronized rotation .",
    "the obtained minimum masses ( @xmath32 ) and the mass ratio ( @xmath33 ) are in agreement with fekel & henry ( 2000 ) .",
    "see table  [ tab : orbt ] for computed parameters .      adopting spectral types derived in @xmath10  3.1 for the primary components and adopting masses and temperatures from landolt - brnstein tables ( schmidt - kaler 1982 ) , we derived masses and spectral types for the secondaries .",

    "we expect a 10% additional error in this distance measure .",
    "since the system is relatively close , the interstellar reddening is neglected .",
    "using the total luminosity based on the measured distance ( 54.26 pc ) for gz  leo , we obtained the total magnitude for the system @xmath40 .",
    "the difference between the observed @xmath13 magnitude ( 8.92 ) and the calculated one can be explained by the presence of photospheric cool spots over the stellar surfaces of both components .",

    "2001a , 2001b ) indicating that both systems are young disk stars .",
    "in addition , the eggen kinematic criteria predict that gz  leo may be a member of hyades supercluster ( see montes et al .",
    "2001a and glvez 2005 ) .",
    "the resonance doublet of li  i at @xmath26707.8   is a spectroscopic feature very important in the diagnostic of age in late - type stars , since it is destroyed easily by thermonuclear reactions in the stellar interior .",
    "the spectral region of this line is included in all our spectra for both systems . at the spectral resolution of our spectra and with the rotational velocity ,",
    "we have determined for the components of both binaries , the li  i line is blended with the nearby fe  i @xmath26707.41    line .",
    "in the case of v789  mon the li  i line is very weak and we could not measure the @xmath3 with the required precision . for gz  leo , we clearly see the li  i+fe  i absorption feature in all the spectra ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : li ] left side ) , but due to the blending with other photospheric lines of both components , we have only measured the @xmath3 in the spectrum of the third night of the foces02 observing run ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : li ] right ) which is very close to conjunction ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the obtained value @xmath3(li  i + fe  i ) = 60.7 m  contain the contribution from both components , but taken into account that they have the same spectral type and contribution to the continuum we can assume that this is also the @xmath3(li  i+fe  i ) of each component . we have corrected this total @xmath3 by subtracting the @xmath3(fe  i ) = 19.8 m  calculated from the empirical relationship with ( @xmath45@xmath13 ) given by favata et al .",
    "( 1993 ) resulting @xmath3(li  i ) = 40.9 m .",
    "one additional estimation of the @xmath3(li  i ) in this spectrum can be obtained by using the spectral subtraction technique . in the subtracted spectrum the contribution from the photospheric lines is eliminated , therefore the @xmath3 = 51.2 m  measured in this spectrum is the total @xmath3(li  i ) and , as both components are equal , also the @xmath3(li  i ) of each one .",
    "the difference in the @xmath3 obtained from both methods is likely due to the influence of the stellar metallicity in the calibration used in the first one to obtain the @xmath3(fe  i ) and in the standard star used as reference in the subtraction technique that are not taken into account here .",
    "the @xmath3(li  i ) of each component we have determined ( 40.9 m  with the first method and 51.2 m  with the second one ) is smaller than the 63 m  estimated by fekel & henry ( 2000 ) and the 60 m  given by strassmeier et al .",
    "the small differences between these values can be attributed to the different method used by these authors to estimate the fe  i contribution and the error in the @xmath3 determination .",
    "this small @xmath3(li  i ) is in agreement with the values observed in hyades cluster stars of this spectral type ( see montes et al .",
    "2001b ) and with the membership to the hyades supercluster ( see @xmath10  3.5 ) . that situated the system age in about 600  myr",
    "the echelle spectra analyzed in this work allowed us to study the behavior of the different chromospheric activity indicators , from the ca  ii h & k to the ca  ii irt lines , which are formed at different atmospheric heights .",

    "the excess emission in @xmath3 is measured in the subtracted spectra , after correcting for the relative contribution of each component in the total continuum .",
    "this contribution is determined by using the radii and temperatures adopted in @xmath10  3 .",
    "for instance , in the h@xmath0 line region the relative contributions were @xmath46 for the primary component and @xmath47 for the secondary component in v789  mon and for gz  leo we had the 0.50 contributions for both components .    in table  [ tab : ew ] we give the corrected @xmath3 for the h@xmath0 and ca  ii irt lines for v789  mon . in table  [ tab : ewf ] we list corrected @xmath3 for the ca  ii h & k , h@xmath48 , h@xmath49 , h@xmath43 , h@xmath50 , h@xmath0 , and ca  ii irt ( @xmath28498 , @xmath28542 , @xmath28662  ) lines for gz  leo in foces run and for h@xmath0 and ca  ii irt in mcdonald run .",

    "the mean measured @xmath3s in these spectra are @xmath3=  1.13/0.84   for each component in the ca  ii k line and @xmath3=  0.82/0.65   for each component in the ca  ii h line .",
    "an increase of the ca  ii h & k emissions is observed with the orbital phase .",
    "the presence of an excess emission from h@xmath48 line ( @xmath3=  0.30/0.43  ) indicates that it is a very active system .",

    "[ fig : irt ] right side ) , we found that in foces run there were no significant variations with the orbital phase , but in mcdonald s one an evident orbital variation were observed which shows an anti - correlation with the @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) variation .",
    "we measured mean @xmath3s of @xmath65   for each component in mcdonald run and @xmath66   for both components in foces run .",
    "in addition , we calculated the ratio of excess emission @xmath3 , @xmath67 , which is also an indicator of the type of chromospheric structure that produces the observed emission . in solar plages , values of @xmath67 @xmath7  1.5 - 3 are measured , while in solar prominences the values are @xmath7  9 , the limit of an optically thin emitting plasma ( chester 1991 ) .    in v789",
    "mon , small values of the @xmath67 ratio were found , @xmath7  1.5 for the primary component and 1.4 for the secondary ( see table  [ tab : ew ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the ca  ii irt emission of this star arises from plage - like regions .    in gz",
    "leo we found a @xmath67 value of @xmath7  2.4 and @xmath7  1.4 for primary and secondary in mcdonald run , but @xmath7  0.9 for primary and secondary in foces run .",
    "these values indicate that ca  ii irt emission come from plage - like regions , in contrast to the balmer lines which seem to come from prominences .    this markedly different behavior of the ca  ii irt and the h@xmath0 emission has also been found in other chromospherically active binaries ( see arvalo & lzaro 1999 ; montes et al .",
    "2000 ; glvez et al .",
    "2003 ; glvez 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the different behavior from one epoch to another is consistent with the different activity level measured in each observing run .",
    "the lack of variation with orbital phase of the gz  leo emission lines in foces run could be due to that the hight level of activity is reflecting a large number of active regions maybe distributed along all surface .",
    "such , could produce an even spotted - plaged surface that would avoid to see the modulation clearly .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of two x - ray / euv selected chromospherically active binary systems v789  mon ( 2re j0725 - 002 ) and gz  leo ( 2re j1101 + 223 ) .",
    "we analyzed high resolution echelle spectra that include the optical chromospheric activity indicators from the ca  ii h & k to ca  ii irt lines , as well as the li  i @xmath26707.8 line and other photospheric lines of interest .    using a large number of radial velocities",
    "we improved the orbital parameters of these systems .",
    "we obtained that both systems have nearly circular orbits and have an orbital period very close to photometric period , indicating that they have a synchronous rotation .",
    "the spectral classification derived using the comparison with spectra of reference stars , two k5v components for v789  mon and two k0v components for gz  leo is in good agreement with the classification obtained from physical parameters ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "as both components are main sequence stars , we can classify these chromospherically active binaries as by@xmath68dra systems ( fekel et al .",
    "1986 ) .    by using the information provided by the width of the ccf we determined a projected rotational velocity , @xmath1 , of 28.28 and 25.09 kms@xmath5 for the primary and secondary components of v789  mon , and 26.23 and 26.98 kms@xmath5 for the components of gz  leo .",
    "the presence of the li  i line in both systems is in agreement with the kinematics results , i.e. , they belong to the young disk population .",
    "also , with a @xmath3(li  i ) @xmath7 40 m  for each component , gz  leo could be a member of the hyades supercluster .",
    "we analyzed , using the spectral subtraction technique , all the optical chromospheric activity indicators . in v789",
    "mon , both components show high levels of chromospheric activity .",
    "the emission in the h@xmath0 line is above the continuum and it is very similar in the two components , showing no variations with phase .",
    "gz  leo shows a high level of chromospheric activity too . after applying spectral subtraction the chromospheric excess emission from both components",
    "are certainly detected in all the activity indicators during the observing runs .",
    "the ca  ii h & k lines are in emission and h@xmath48 is also detected in emission for both systems .",
    "the level of chromospheric emission change , i.e. , we have observed a 35% increment in the @xmath3 of h@xmath0 emission line and a nearly 30% increment in the @xmath3 of ca  ii irt emission lines from one epoch to another .",
    "furthermore , the variation of h@xmath0 and ca  ii  irt emission with phase is anti - correlated and the ratios @xmath69 and @xmath67 indicate that the emission of the balmer lines would arise from prominence - like material , and that the emission of ca  ii irt lines arise from plage - like regions .",
