    "the evolution of shell structures governs the variation of ground - state nuclear shapes along isotopic and isotonic chains .",
    "nuclear structure explores a variety of phenomena related to structural evolution including , for instance , the reduction of spherical shell gaps and modifications of magic numbers in nuclei far from stability , occurrence of islands of inversion and coexistence of shapes with different deformations .",
    "as the number of nucleons changes from nucleus to nucleus , in general one observes a gradual evolution of different shapes  spherical , axially deformed , shapes that are soft with respect to triaxial deformations .",
    "these shape transitions reflect the underlying modifications of single - nucleon shell structure and interactions between valence nucleons .",
    "an especially interesting feature is the possible occurrence of shape phase transitions and critical - point phenomena for particular values of the number of protons and neutrons .",
    "phase transitions in the equilibrium shapes of nuclei correspond to first- and second - order quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) between competing ground - state phases induced by variation of a non - thermal control parameter ( number of nucleons ) at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "nuclear quantum phase transitions have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies during the last decade . for recent reviews and an exhaustive bibliography",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "even though phase transitions in finite systems can only be defined in the classical limit in which the number of constituents tends to infinity , i.e. the transition is actually smoothed out in finite systems , there are nevertheless clear experimental signatures of abrupt changes in structure properties of finite nuclei with the addition or subtraction of only few nucleons .",
    "this is another distinct feature of qpt in atomic nuclei , i.e. the physical control parameter  number of nucleons , can only take discrete integer values .",
    "expectation values of suitably chosen operators , that as observables characterize the state of a nuclear system , can be used as order parameters @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of nuclear qpt are typically based on macroscopic geometric models of nuclear shapes and potentials @xcite and/or semi - microscopic algebraic models @xcite . in the geometric framework qpts",
    "are analyzed in terms of a bohr collective hamiltonian for shape variables , and can be related to the concept of critical - point symmetries that provide parameter - independent predictions for excitation spectra and electromagnetic transition rates for nuclei at the phase transition point .",
    "alternatively , in the algebraic approach ( e.g. the interacting boson model ( ibm ) ) different shapes coincide with particular dynamical symmetries of some algebraic structure , and the phase transition occurs when these symmetries are broken in a specific way .",
    "the two frameworks can be related , for instance , by using the coherent state formalism @xcite which allows to establish a correspondence between the symmetry limits of the algebraic hamiltonian and energy functionals expressed in terms of collective shape variables . in both approaches , geometric and algebraic ,",
    "the description of qpt is based on model specific hamiltonians which by construction describe shape changes .",
    "a shape phase transition is then accessed by variation of a control parameter .",
    "the two best studied classes of nuclear shape phase transitions , both theoretically and experimentally , correspond to a second - order qpt between spherical and @xmath5-soft shapes @xcite , and a first - order qpt between spherical and axially deformed shapes @xcite .",
    "the former is a phase transition in one degree of freedom  the axial deformation @xmath4 and , in the ibm language , represents a transition between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 dynamical symmetries in the limit of large boson number .",
    "the critical point of phase transition can also be related to a dynamical symmetry : in this case e(5 ) @xcite , and the experimental realization of this critical - point symmetry was first identified in the spectrum of @xmath9ba @xcite .",
    "the second type of shape transitions , between spherical and axially deformed nuclei , is more commonly encountered and involves two degrees of freedom  the deformations @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the critical point of this phase transition , denoted x(5 ) , does not correspond to a dynamical symmetry in the usual sense @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the particular case in which the @xmath4 and @xmath5 degrees of freedom are decoupled , an approximate analytic solution at the critical point of phase transition can be expressed in terms of zeros of bessel functions of irrational order @xcite .",
    "evidence for the empirical realization of x(5 ) phase transition was first reported for @xmath10sm and other @xmath6 isotones in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "even though phenomenological approaches to nuclear qpt have been very successful , and the predicted isotopic trends for various observables are in very good agreement with data , it would clearly be desirable to have a fully microscopic description of shape phase transitions , starting from nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is especially important in view of the fact that the physical control parameter in nuclear qpt is the actual number of nucleons in a nucleus , rather than a strength parameter of a model specific , ising - type hamiltonian .",
    "several recent studies @xcite have reported microscopic calculations of potential energy surfaces as functions of quadrupole deformation , for a number of isotopic chains in which the occurrence of shape phase transitions had been predicted .",
    "potentials calculated with a constraint on the mass quadrupole moment display shape transitions from spherical to deformed configurations . in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed shape transitions in nd isotopes , using a microscopic model based on relativistic energy density functionals ( edf ) . starting from constrained self - consistent mean - field calculations of potential energy curves , the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite was used to perform configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected relativistic wave functions .",
    "it was shown that the microscopic framework based on universal edfs , adjusted to nuclear ground - state properties , and extended to take into account correlations related to symmetry restoration and fluctuations of collective variables , describes not only general features of shape transitions , but also the unique behavior of excitation spectra and transition rates at the critical point of quantum shape phase transition .",
    "in particular , the particle - number projected gcm spectra , intraband and interband b(e2 ) values for @xmath11nd were found in excellent agreement with data , and close to the x(5)-model predictions for @xmath12nd .",

    "x(5 ) denotes a particular model for a first - order qpt between spherical and axially deformed shapes , based on the assumption of a separable potential @xmath13 . by neglecting the small barrier between the competing spherical and deformed minima , i.e. taking an infinite square well in the variable @xmath4 , and assuming an axially stabilized potential @xmath14 ,",

    "first , although it displays a wide flat minimum in @xmath4 on the prolate side , the flat bottom of the potential does not start at @xmath15 , i.e. the coexisting shapes do not include the spherical configuration . in this respect the microscopic potential is closer to the generalization of the axially symmetric x(5 ) solution for the collective bohr hamiltonian to the transition path between x(5 ) and the rigid - rotor limit , represented by infinite square - well potentials over a confined range of values @xmath16 ( confined @xmath4-soft potential , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the positions of the inner and outer walls on the @xmath4 axis , respectively ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite was restricted to axially symmetric shapes ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we note that an exactly separable @xmath5-rigid version ( with @xmath19 ) of the x(5 ) model has been constructed in ref .",

    "@xcite , has shown that many properties of the solution are dominated by @xmath20 coupling induced by the kinetic energy operator .",
    "band - head excitation energies , energy spacings within the bands , and transition strengths are strongly dependent on the @xmath5 stiffness of the potential .",
    "the importance of the explicit treatment of the triaxial degree of freedom , i.e. inclusion of @xmath20 coupling , was also emphasized in two recent studies @xcite that used the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov model , based on the finite - range and density - dependent gogny interaction , to generate potential energy surfaces in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite excitation spectra of nd isotopes were calculated using the gcm with particle - number and angular - momentum projected axially symmetric wave functions . however , while gcm configuration mixing of axially symmetric mean - field states is routinely performed in studies of collective excitation spectra , the application of this method to triaxial shapes is a much more difficult problem .",
    "only very recently a model has been introduced  @xcite , based on triaxial mean - field states , projected on particle number and angular momentum and mixed by the generator coordinate method .",

    "the fact that the band - head @xmath104 of the quasi-@xmath4 band has the lowest excitation energy in @xmath12nd can be attributed to the softness ( flatness ) of the potential with respect to @xmath4 deformation ( cf . figs .",

    "we have applied the recently developed model for the solution of a five - dimensional collective hamiltonian for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom , with parameters determined by constrained self - consistent relativistic mean - field calculations for triaxial shapes , to a microscopic study of shape transitions in nd , sm and gd isotopes with neutron number @xmath58 .",

    "the diagonalization of the resulting hamiltonian yields the excitation energies and collective wave functions",
    ". an important feature of the model is that physical observables , such as e2 transition rates , are calculated in the full configuration space . using the bare value of the proton charge ,",
    "parameter - free transition probabilities between eigenstates of the collective hamiltonian can be directly compared with experimental values . in the current implementation of the model",
    "the moments of inertia are calculated with the inglis - belyaev formula .",
    "the resulting values are considerably smaller than than the empirical moments of inertia and therefore , in order to compare the relative excitation energies with data , it was necessary to increase the inglis - belyaev moments of inertia .",
    "the effective values were adjusted to reproduce the experimental energies of the @xmath111 state in the ground - state band of each nucleus .",
    "a detailed analysis of shape transitions in nd isotopes has been carried out , from the spherical @xmath64nd to the strongly deformed @xmath59nd . with increasing neutron number",
    "the nd isotopes remain prolate deformed in the lowest state , and the calculation reproduces the characteristic signatures of shape transitions : @xmath138 and b(e2 ; @xmath100 ) , as well as the isotopic dependence of the effective order parameter @xmath103 , which takes the special value of @xmath107 close to a first - order phase transition point .    both the data and the results of microscopic calculations show that there is an abrupt change of structure at @xmath6 .",
    "the microscopic potential energy surface of @xmath12nd displays a flat prolate minimum that extends in the interval @xmath69 of the axial deformation parameter , and a parabolic dependence on @xmath5 for @xmath73 in the region of the flat prolate minimum .",
    "the resulting excitation spectrum of @xmath12nd , calculated with the pc - f1 density functional , and the corresponding intraband and interband b(e2 ) values , are in good agreement with available data for the ground - state band , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands .",

    "the parameter - free predictions for the b(e2 ) s reproduce not only the experimental values for intraband transitions within the ground - state band and the @xmath4 band , but also for transitions from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands to the ground - state band , including the measured branching ratios . the sequence of neutron single - particle levels in nd isotopes , as functions of the axial deformation parameter @xmath4 , and the isotopic dependence of the corresponding fermi level , offer a qualitative explanation of the @xmath4-softness of the potential in @xmath12nd .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the sm and gd nuclei , and in particular the spectra of the collective hamiltonian and the corresponding e2 transition rates reproduce the data in the @xmath6 isotones @xmath10sm and @xmath59gd .    a number of experimental studies over the last decade have disclosed candidate nuclei for quantum shape phase transitions in several mass regions .",
    "in addition to geometric and algebraic theoretical methods , it is also important to study these phenomena using microscopic models that explicitly take into account nucleonic degrees of freedom . among the microscopic approaches to the nuclear many - body problem",
    ", the framework of nuclear energy density functionals ( edf ) provides the most complete description of ground - state properties and collective excitations over the whole nuclide chart .",
    "this work , together with similar recent studies , has shown that self - consistent mean - field models based on the edf framework describe not only general features of shape transitions , but also particular properties of spectra and transition rates at the critical point of qpt .",
    "however , to calculate excitation spectra and transition probabilities , the self - consistent mean - field approach must be extended to include correlations related to restoration of broken symmetries and fluctuations of collective variables .",
    "this can be done either by performing gcm configuration mixing calculations of projected wave functions , or by constructing collective bohr - type hamiltonians with deformation - dependent parameters determined from self - consistent mean - field calculations .",
    "the possibility to perform self - consistent microscopic studies of shape transitions opens a new perspective on the origin of nuclear qpt in various mass regions .",
