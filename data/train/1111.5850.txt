    "microlensing monitoring programs have been operating since the early 1990s @xcite .",
    "these programs monitor large areas of the sky in the hope that a planetary or stellar mass object will pass close enough to the position of a more distant `` source '' star to cause a detectable lensing event .",
    "more than 8,000 lensing event candidates have now been identified . among all possible gravitational lenses , nearby masses ( d@xmath6  1 kpc ) hold a special place @xcite . their einstein radii ( @xmath7 ) are larger than they would be were they to be as distant as the typical microlens ( several kpc away along directions to the bulge , and several tens of kpc away along directions to the magellanic clouds ) , and their angular motions are significantly faster .",
    "the combination of a large einstein ring and angular speed means that nearby stars have a larger probability of producing a detectable lensing event .",
    "furthermore , because nearby stars can be independently detected , the degeneracy inherent in lensing light curves can be overcome , allowing us to determine their gravitational mass . because many nearby stars already have their positions and proper motions known to some accuracy , we can _ predict _ and plan for the monitoring of specific events @xcite . very nearby stars moving against the backdrop of the milky way",
    "@xcite make promising targets in this regard because the high field densities provide more opportunities for chance alignments .",
    "lensing events can also be used to search for stellar or substellar companions .",
    "because the shape of the lensing light - curve is sensitive to the mass distribution of the lens system @xcite , orbiting planets can produce significant , short - lasting deviations from the standard microlensing profile . to detect a planet in a lensing light curve",
    ", moderate - cadence monitoring must be supplemented by high cadence observations @xcite , triggered when a deviation to the single - mass microlensing light curve is detected .",
    "several exoplanets have already been detected using this method , which holds strong potential to provide a wealth of statistical data on planetary masses and orbital distributions , especially in the wide separation range .",
    "unfortunately , most planetary systems detected through microlensing are relatively far from the sun , and their host stars are much dimmer than the background source @xcite .",
    "this seriously limits the possibilities for follow - up observations , making it near - impossible to confirm the presence of the planet by other means ( spectroscopic , photometric , astrometric ) and limiting the information one can obtain about the host star .",
    "most exoplanet detections through microlensing light - curves are essentially `` one shot deals '' .",
    "microlensing by a nearby star , also called `` mesolensing '' , would have all the potential for detecting exoplanets through microlensing , with the added bonus that the lens system would be much more amenable to follow - up observations .",
    "the presence of the planet could potentially be confirmed using secondary detection methods , and the properties of the host star could be easily determined , if not already known .    in this letter , we predict a future event associated with the low - mass star vb  10 , based on precise astrometric measurements made with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. we investigate the detectability of the event itself and of any secondary event that might be produced by a hypothetical planet in orbit around the star .",

    ". given the similar results , we conclude that under the assumption that [ vb  10]-pmls-1 has a proper motion in the 5 - 10  mas yr@xmath35 range , there is a roughly 1 in 2 chance that an alignment will occur with separation of 100  mas or less , a 1 in 5 chance for an alignment with separation of 50  mas , and a 1 in 10 chance of an alignment with separation 20  mas or less .",
    "the time of closest approach varies depending on the relative path of vb  10 to the background sources .",
    "the median value is 2011 december 21 , with a dispersion of @xmath930 days .    from the projected trajectory of vb  10 , and assuming the m8.0v dwarf to have a mass of @xmath36m@xmath37 @xcite , it is possible to predict the magnification and astrometric shift of [ vb  10]-pmls-1 due to gravitational lensing .",
    "the angular radius of the einstein ring ( @xmath38 ) of vb  10 is approximately equal to @xmath39  mas . as discussed above , trajectories",
    "consistent with the astrometric measurements produce distances of closest approach from @xmath40 ( @xmath41  mas ) to @xmath42 ( @xmath43  mas ) . at @xmath41  mas ,",
    "the total magnification of the background star is @xmath44 .",
    "the magnification at @xmath45  mas is @xmath46 , while it is @xmath47 at @xmath48  mas .",
    "the decline is steep , because the magnification falls as @xmath49 .",
    "the centroid shift falls off more slowly with distance ( @xmath50 ) , and the astrometric shift would be approximately ( @xmath51,@xmath52,@xmath53 )  mas , for distances of closest approaches of ( @xmath41,@xmath45,@xmath48 )  mas , respectively .",
    "there are complications to observing this predicted mesolensing event .",
    "first , vb  10 is brighter than [ vb  10]-pmls-1",
    ". the magnification light curve will thus be significantly diluted , and the astrometric shift reduced . in the infrared ( @xmath54 ) the @xmath55 dilution factor will reduce the amplitude of a 6% event to less than 1 part in 10@xmath30 . in the blue ( @xmath21 ) however , the light from [ vb  10]-pmls-1 is diluted by a factor @xmath56 , which would reduce the amplitude of the event to a @xmath57% of the integrated flux .",
    "in addition , vb  10 will be close to the sun in december and january , making ground observations challenging and space observations impossible when the source falls e.g. within the solar avoidance zone of hst ( figure 2 , bottom panel ) .",
    "if vb  10 has a dark companion , the effects of lensing can be enhanced .",
    "@xcite measurements exclude a 3.2 m@xmath3 planet with period of 270 days , and the @xcite radial velocity measurements exclude most planets with masses @xmath582.5 m@xmath3 . however planets with a range of masses and orbits are still possible .",
    "the type of secondary effect expected in the microlensing light curve depends on the orbital separation between the planet and vb  10 , but also on the orientation of the orbital plane , and on the orbital phase .",
    "we generate sets of microlensing light curves for one of three possible trajectories for vb  10 , with distances of closest approach @xmath0=  20  mas , 50  mas , and 100  mas ; these are the trajectories shown in figure 2 . for each path , we calculate circular face - on planetary orbits in which a jupiter - mass planet orbits vb  10 .",
    "we consider three separate orbital periods of 100  days , 271  days , and 1,000  days .",
    "we compute light curves for each of several thousand choices of the initial orbital phase , chosen uniformly between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this allows us to compute the fraction of the time the peak magnification is larger than some arbitrary value ( e.g. 30% ) .",
    "we find a small fraction of events in which the planet makes a significantly closer approach to the source star than does vb  10 itself , resulting in a large magnification ( figure 3 ) . for the @xmath61  mas path , events of all three orbital periods are found to generate some high magnification peaks . for @xmath62  mas trajectories ,",
    "only the planets on @xmath63-day , and @xmath64-day orbits generate high magnification events , while for @xmath65  mas trajectories , only planets on a @xmath64-day orbit generate events with significant magnification . for planets on a @xmath64-day orbit",
    ", we found the probability of a @xmath66 magnification event to be @xmath67 for all three values of @xmath0 .",
    "planets on a @xmath63-day orbit had a @xmath68 probability of a generating @xmath69 magnification events in both @xmath70  mas and @xmath71  mas models ( no such events are generated in the @xmath72  mas case ) .",
    "the direction of orbital motion influences the event probability for planets with shorter orbital periods .",
    "for example , a planet on a @xmath48-day orbit ( which can generate events for @xmath0 less than or equal to about @xmath41  mas ) has a @xmath73 chance of generating events with @xmath66 magnifications with one orbital direction and a @xmath74 chance if the orbital direction is reversed , giving an average of @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , we find that secondary events can occur up to 3 months before or after the primary event , depending on the period and orbital phase of the companion . predicted composite light curves for the magnification events shown in figure 3 are displayed in figure 4 , and show the apparent magnitude of the unresolved source and lens accounting for the dilution from the light of vb  10 .",
    "the secondary events retain symmetrical profiles , but blending reduces the timescale of the peak to @xmath761  day .",
    "this prediction of a microlensing event associated with the very low mass star vb  10 constitutes a unique opportunity for observational astronomy .",
    "detection of the primary event presents severe challenges .",
    "the lensed source is a faint background star , which means that the event will suffer significant dilution from vb  10 .",
    "the event will also occur at an inopportune time , because vb  10 will be close to the sun near the time of the event , making it an evening star at unfavorable airmass .",
    "proximity to the sun will also prevent observations from _ hst _ and other space telescopes , which have solar avoidance angles of @xmath7750 degrees . in the red or infrared , the large dilution from the vb 10",
    "light will make the event undetectable using existing facilities . at best",
    ", the light - curve for the unresolved source and lens may reach an amplitude @xmath2% in the blue , for a source with magnitude @xmath78 .",
    "the detection of such a weak event would be difficult if not impractical .",
    "however , our simulations show that intensive monitoring of the event in the months _ before _ and _ after _ the primary event could potentially yield the microlensing detection of a planet orbiting vb  10 , if the proper alignment conditions are met .",
    "evidence has now been accumulating that low - mass stars can hold planetary retinues . indeed",
    "the 0.3@xmath79 m dwarf gj 581 is now the system with the largest number of confirmed planets @xcite , and several other low - mass m dwarfs have been found to have planetary companions .",
    "a massive planet was also recently discovered orbiting an m dwarf through microlensing @xcite .",
    "it is thus a definite possibility that vb  10 might have associated planets . if the proper alignment conditions are met , then secondary microlensing events could reach high enough magnifications to be detected . if an event yields a total magnification of the source+lens light by 30% or more , then a signal to noise ratio s / n@xmath5810 would be sufficient for a 3-@xmath80 detection achievable in minutes of exposure on a 1-meter class telescope .",
    "simulations show that high magnification events due to orbiting planets would have timescales of several hours . a monitoring campaign on vb  10 to detect them would thus require intensive monitoring from multiple sites of various longitudes .",
    "these events could occur at any time up to a few months before and after the peak of the primary event , which means that they could be occuring at anytime through winter 2012 or even later .",
    "intrinsic variability in vb  10 might however complicate the detection of a planetary microlensing event .",
    "vb  10 is a known flare star @xcite , and the activity and flaring rate for a red dwarf with very late spectral type ( m8 ) is expected to be high @xcite .",
    "flares , however , typically show a rapid rise on timescales of minutes , followed by an exponential decay lasting @xmath761 hour @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the symmetric light curve with a timescale of severeal hours expected of a hypothetical planetary microlensing event ( see figure 4 )",
    ". it will be critical to characterize the base variability level and intrinsic variability patterns in vb  10 , which will be possible when the system is no longer susceptible to microlensing .",
