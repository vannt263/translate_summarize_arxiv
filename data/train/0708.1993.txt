    "the complexity of how cells respond to their changing environments requires the understanding of gene regulation and protein expression . an interesting diauxic growth pattern of _ escherichia coli _ ( _ e . coli _ ) on glucose and lactose nutrients has been extensively studied and well characterized for a long time ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "[ diauxiceps ] illustrates a biphasic growth pattern of _ e. coli _ in a glucose - rich and lactose - rich medium . since extra energy is required to make additional enzymes ( lactose permease and @xmath0galactosidase ) for the lactose transportation and metabolization , the utilization of glucose was always preferred .",
    "the diauxic growth pattern can be explained by the lactose operon genetic regulatory network and the inducer exclusion .",
    "diauxic growth of _",
    "e. coli _ on glucose and lactose .",
    "i : glucose growth phase ; ii : lag phase ; iii : lactose growth phase . _",
    "e. coli _ preferentially takes glucose and when the glucose nutrient is depleted , a short lag phase appears before the cell growth resuming on the lactose utilization .",
    "note that the logarithmic scale used in the number of cells.,width=288,height=240 ]    quantitative mathematical models of the lactose operon and diauxic growth have been investigated by many authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . a recent genetically structured model for the diauxic growth of _ e. coli _ on glucose and lactose was developed by @xcite . in their work , all known information including the lactose operon transcription and translation processes , the flux models of unidirectional glucose transport and bidirectional lactose transport , the inducer exclusion , the catabolite repression , and the repressor dna loop repression , was described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . by solving the system odes with appropriate experimental parameters",
    ", they produced a typical diauxic growth curve .",
    "however , no comparison was made with experimental data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed another structured mathematical model of glucose - lactose diauxic growth and it was validated by their own experiments .",
    "many other studies of lactose operon modeling were on the stability analysis of steady states and dynamic evolutions of _ e. coli _ on the lactose nutrient only . @xcite and @xcite developed their mathematical models including the time delay of translation processes explicitly .",
    "similar to @xcite , a simple hill s function was applied as the regulation function of the lactose operon .",
    "@xcite reported that there was a hysteresis of solution within a certain range of the parameter space .",
    "@xcite showed a bistable steady state of the lactose operon .",
    "however , a common problem in their model was the assumption of a constant growth rate .",
    "this assumption is only valid in the exponential growth period , and may not be true through the period from the initial growth of _",
    "e. coli _ to the exponential balanced growth .    in this paper",
    ", we extended the mathematical model proposed by @xcite on one hand by including more realistic complexities ( for example , the time delay of translation processes of protein synthesis ) ; on the other hand , we simplified their model ( for example , by using an intuitive definition of the growth rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "as is known , validation and prediction are two essential features for any useful mathematical model for real biological systems .",
    "therefore , the focus of this present work is to validate this extended mathematical model by two particular experiments data , and predict the diauxic growth pattern of a wild type _",
    "e. coli _ on glucose and lactose in general .",
    "to construct the mathematical model , we made four changes to the model of @xcite .",
    "first , a modified bidirectional flux model based on a simple microscopic description of the symmetric lactose transport was derived .",
    "this change connects the difference of the influx and efflux of the lactose transport .",
    "second , the time delay of translation processes was considered explicitly . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", it was important but failed to appear in wong s model .",
    "in addition , the rate of translation was modeled by an empirical function of the _ e. coli _ growth rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the third change concerned the growth rate of _",
    "e. coli_. in our treatment , we used the growth rate that depends on the glucose and lactose uptake rate .",
    "this intuitive definition let us eliminate the stiffness of the model of @xcite .",
    "the last change was on the inducer exclusion .",
    "a hill s function with a higher steepness to model the inhibition of lactose permease was employed since it was reported by @xcite that the inducer exclusion may play a major role in the glucose - lactose diauxic growth pattern .",
    "the studies presented here had three parts .",
    "in the first part , we defined three levels of @xmath0galactosidase : basal level , partly induced level , and fully induced level . for the lactose nutrient only ,",
    "we calculated the time evolution of @xmath0galactosidase and compared it to @xcite experimental data . in the second part , we studied the diauxic growth of a particular _ e. coli _",
    "mg @xmath1 .",
    "the cell biomass of _",
    "mg @xmath1 was calculated by inputting the same concentrations of glucose and lactose as those in experimental studies by @xcite ( http:@xmath2www.ou.edu/microarray@xmath3oumcf@xmath3growth@xmath4trans.htm ) . to fit the experimental data , we converted the cell biomass to the corresponding experimental optical density ( od ) , and provided an analysis of the discrepancy between the numerical results and the observed od in the lactose growth period .",
    "the numerical results of the mathematical model for both cases are in good agreement with these two experiments data . in the third part , by adjusting the rate of glucose transport , the diauxic growth pattern of a wild type _",
    "e. coli _ was studied .",
    "the structure of the lactose operon system is shown in fig .",
    "[ lacoperoneps ] .",
    "the transcription of the lactose operon is regulated by the interaction of three transcription factors with their corresponding effectors at their binding sites in dna listed in table [ effectortable ] .",
    "the @xmath5 effector , if associated with the rna polymerase , can help the rna polymerase to find its promoter site and prepare to initiate the transcription .",
    "the lactose operon ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is a segment of dna molecule in an _",
    "e. coli _ cell with its length @xmath6 .",
    "it consists of three genes and three different regulation sites .",
    "the three genes are _ lacz _ , _ lacy _ and _ laca _ and their products are @xmath7galactosidase , lactose permease , and transacetylase respectively .",
    "the enzyme @xmath7galactosidase breaks lactose and allolactose into glucose and galactose , and transforms lactose to allolactose .",
    "lactose permease is in charge of transporting lactose into or out of the cell .",
    "the function of transacetylase is not clear in the lactose operon regulatory network , and thus is not considered in this study .",
