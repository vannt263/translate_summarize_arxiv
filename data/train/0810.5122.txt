    "since @xcite , the bimodality in the distribution of galaxy properties has been one of the great curiosities in the field of astronomy .",
    "bimodality is observed in galaxy colours , morphology , star formation rates and galaxy stellar masses .",
    "modern spectroscopic galaxy surveys have allowed us to quantify the bimodality precisely , especially with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite . even at high redshift , evidence for bimodality in the galaxy population",
    "is being sought and found .",
    "recent observations have revealed that since a redshift of around unity the total mass of stars living in red sequence galaxies has increased by a factor of two @xcite . at the same time , the stellar mass density of the blue sequence has remained almost constant .",
    "the interpretation is that some blue galaxies migrate onto the red sequence after the quenching of their star formation , whilst the remainder continue to form new stars .",
    "this quenching of star formation is apparently occurring in galaxies of increasingly lower masses as the universe ages @xcite .",
    "so - called `` dry '' ( gas poor ) mergers , with little associated star formation , can increase individual galaxy masses within the red - sequence , forming the massive ellipticals seen today @xcite . as well as allowing the building of very massive ellipticals ,",
    "such a scenario matches the observed kinematic and photometric properties of present - day ellipticals @xcite .    the overall decrease in global sfr density since @xmath12 appears to be caused by a gradual decline in the mean sfr of galaxies , rather than a decrease in the number of starbursts .",
    "however , the process , or processes , responsible for this gradual decline remain to be determined .",
    "what physical mechanisms cause a galaxy to stop forming stars , to turn into a spheroid , and thus to enter the red sequence ?",
    "there are many competing theories which address one or both of these problems .",
    "hot gas stripping ( sometimes called strangulation ) of small galaxies as they fall into overdense environments leads to a slow quenching of their star formation @xcite . in regions of high external pressure",
    ", the cold gas may also be stripped from the galaxies by ram pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "gas rich major mergers may perform both tasks , causing a starburst that is strong enough to rapidly exhaust the supply of fuel , and convert the disk galaxies into spheroids . in this latter scenario ,",
    "subsequent cooling from the inter - galactic medium may cause a disk to reform and return the galaxy to the blue sequence .",
    "therefore , the existence and efficient coupling to the ism of additional mechanical energy from a central active nucleus ( often called agn feedback ) has been proposed to prevent refueling and allow the red sequence to build @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for the existence , but above all the relative importance of each of these scenarios , remains scarce .",
    "much progress has been made on understanding galaxy mergers since the advent of high resolution computer simulations .",
    "realistic observational comparisons are now becoming easier through the application of observational filter functions , point - spread functions and radiative transfer of starlight through dust , to simulation outputs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , many areas of parameter space remain relatively unexplored with potentially large implications for our overall understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , the comparison between simulations of galaxy mergers with and without mechanical agn feedback is rarely focused upon , with some groups preferring to focus on starburst feedback , and others on the possible impact of an active nucleus ( for an exception , see * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper",
    "we compare observational results directly with a suite of smoothed - particle hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers from @xcite , both with and without agn feedback , by converting the star formation histories of the simulated galaxies into integrated spectra , upon which the same analysis can be performed as upon the observations .",
    "rest - frame optical spectra contain a wealth of information about a galaxy s past and present star formation rate , often referred to as the galaxy `` fossil record '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in particular ,",
    "the 4000  break and  absorption line strengths constrain the specific star formation rate and amplitude of recent bursts of star formation @xcite . at low redshift ,",
    "the quality of spectra and models now allow the analysis of large spectral regions @xcite . at high redshift ,",
    "spectral indices easily separate blue from red sequence galaxies without the complication of dust . at these redshifts , where galaxy spectra are in general noisier , modern statistical techniques present us with the opportunity to vastly increase the quantity and improve the quality of derived parameters . following @xcite , this paper presents a principal component analysis of the 4000  break region of more than one thousand high redshift galaxy spectra culled from the vimos vlt deep survey .",
    "we use the information encoded in the spectra to recover the recent star formation history of galaxies at an epoch when the universe was very different from today .    from an observational perspective , so - called `` transition '' galaxies are of significant interest for pinning down which physical processes play the largest role in shaping the evolution of galaxies",
    ". classes of galaxies which could be transitioning between the blue and red sequences are `` post - starburst '' galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and `` green - valley '' galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this amounts to @xmath13m@xmath7/yr / mpc@xmath3 for a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , or about @xmath14m@xmath7/yr in the entire vvds survey volume .",
    "as we shall show in this paper , galaxies which have undergone sudden quenching of star formation can be identified in vvds spectra for a period of @xmath15gyr after the quenching event .",
    "therefore , if the entire build up of the red sequence were due to a physical process associated with fast quenching , such as gas rich major mergers , we could expect to identify a net transitioning stellar mass of @xmath16m@xmath7/mpc@xmath3 , or about @xmath17m@xmath7 in the vvds survey , after accounting for targeting rates .",
    "this could comprise , for example , a few tens of galaxies of stellar mass @xmath18 .",
    "the primary questions that we wish to address in this paper are , how much mass do we see entering the red sequence after an episode of fast quenching ?",
    "are gas - rich major mergers an important mechanism for the build up of the red - sequence since @xmath12 ?",

    "the survey is unique for high redshift galaxy surveys in having applied no further colour cuts to minimise contamination from stars , yielding a particularly simple selection function . in this work",
    "we make use of @xmath25 spectra from the publicly available first epoch public data release of the vvds-0226 - 04 ( vvds-02h ) field which covers an area of 1750 square arcmins .",

    "the photometric data is used primarily for the purpose of deriving stellar masses , as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see section [ sec : ms ] ) .      in order to calculate absolute quantities from galaxy redshift surveys , such as galaxy numbers and mass densities",
    ", it is necessary to account for several effects which cause galaxies not to be included . for our work",
    "there are three effects :    * the _ target sampling rate _ ( tsr ) : only a fraction of all galaxies in the given magnitude range and survey area are targeted for spectroscopic follow - up . * the _ spectroscopic success rate _",
    "( ssr ) : a fraction of targeted and observed galaxies can not be successfully assigned redshifts , due to either sky line contamination or featureless spectra . *",
    "the spectroscopic _ quality success rate _ ( qsr ) : only a fraction of the targeted galaxies with successful redshifts have high enough quality spectra from which star formation histories can be measured .",
    "the tsr and ssr are common to many results derived from the vvds , such as luminosity functions , and are explained in detail in e.g. ; only the qsr is new to this work .      as described in , in order to maximise the number of targeted objects per vimos pointing , the tsr is a function of the size of the galaxy .",
    "we obtain the tsr from figure 1 of and weight each galaxy according to its size @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the x - radius parameter of each galaxy .      the second effect , the ssr , is potentially much more complicated , because the success of obtaining a redshift for a galaxy depends not only on the apparent magnitude of the galaxy , but also on its redshift and spectral type .",
    "the rest - frame spectroscopic features which allow accurate redshift determinations depend on the spectral type of the galaxy and move through the observed - frame wavelength range depending on the redshift of the galaxy . in the vvds",
    "each object is assigned a redshift quality flag , which approximates the security of the given redshift .",
    "galaxies with flags 2 , 3 , 4 and 9 are deemed secure . in order to account for the changing ssr as a function of redshift , and following the method presented in section 3.2 of",
    ", we estimate the ssr by making use of the photometric redshifts calculated by , which are publicly available through the terapix consortium .",
    "we calculate the ssr as a function of redshift and magnitude , as the number of objects with secure redshifts ( flags 2,3,4,9 ) divided by the total number of objects ( with flags 0,1,2,3,4 and 9 ) .",
    "photometric redshifts are used to place the galaxies without secure spectroscopic redshifts in the correct redshift bin .",
    "we calculate the ssr in 4 bins of apparent magnitude 1921 , 2122 , 2222.5 and 22.523 , with bins in @xmath34 of width 0.05 .",
    "galaxies brighter than 19 and fainter than 23 magnitudes are not used in this work , the former because of our lower redshift limit of @xmath35 and the latter because of the signal - to - noise limitation we place on the spectra as described in the following subsection .",
    "we weight each galaxy in our sample by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the spectroscopic redshift of the galaxy , and @xmath38 is its @xmath39-band apparent magnitude .",
    "it is important that galaxies with different seds are treated equally during this weighting procedure .",
    "quiescent galaxies are the hardest to assign redshifts to , due to their lack of emission lines .",
    "to check that the completeness for quiescent galaxies is accurately estimated using the sed - independent method described above , we split our sample into high and low sfr subsamples , where sfr was measured from sed fitting to multiwavelength photometry ( see section [ sec : ms ] ) .",
    "we repeated the calculation of @xmath40 for each subsample and found them to be consistent with each other over the redshift range @xmath41 used in this paper .",
    "this redshift range is expected to be the least problematic , due to the coverage of the 4000  break which is strong in quiescent populations .",
    "the final selection criterium applied to the vvds galaxies to create the sample studied in this paper is that they have spectra of high enough continuum snr to allow us to extract useful information on their star formation histories . in practice , this means a median per - pixel - snr larger than 6.5 .",
    "the snr of the observed spectrum depends on both the apparent magnitude of the galaxy , because all galaxies are observed with equal exposure times , and the redshift of the galaxy , because the flux of a galaxy varies with wavelength .",
    "thus , in a similar manner as for the ssr , we define the quality success rate ( qsr ) to be the total number of galaxies with secure redshifts and snr greater than our limit , divided by the total number of galaxies with secure redshifts ( flags 2,3,4 and 9 ) .",
    "we calculate this in the same four bins of apparent magnitude used for the ssr and in spectroscopic redshift bins of width @xmath42 .",
    "we weight each galaxy in our sample by @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 is shown in figure [ fig : qsr ] for the four magnitude bins . in section",
    "[ sec : massdens ] we will show that we recover stellar mass densities consistent with previous work , despite the addition of this new selection criterion .    imposing a snr threshold on the data",
    "was found to be necessary for this work . using spectra with",
    "too low snr causes considerable scatter in our spectroscopic indices , which makes difficult the robust identification of the post - starburst galaxies in which we are primarily interested .",
    "this problem is easily identifiable : the increased scatter in the indices causes the number of post - starburst galaxies to increase relative to the total sample , and biases the snr distribution of the candidate post - starbursts towards lower values than typically seen in the population as a whole .",
    "therefore the snr limit was chosen empirically , by ensuring that the distribution of snr in our post - starburst galaxy sample was similar to that for galaxies of other types , and that our total completeness - corrected stellar mass densities for each class of galaxy ( i.e. quiescent , star forming , post - starburst , starburst ) remained constant when the snr limit was increased by a small amount .",
    "we found that a per - pixel - snr limit of 6.5 was required for the purposes of our study .",
    "a full description of the method used to measure the stellar masses of our galaxies is given in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "briefly , we derive the stellar mass m@xmath45 for each galaxy by fitting its multi - band uv  ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , to model stellar populations created using the @xcite population synthesis models , assuming a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we create a library of exponentially declining star formation histories with superposed stochastic top - hat bursts ( see kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 and salim et al .",
    "2005 for descriptions of similar libraries ) .",
    "the method uses bayesian probability distribution functions as described in appendix a of kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to derive physical parameter estimates for each observed sed , including errors on the parameters . for a detailed discussion of the accuracy of stellar mass estimates using sed fitting methods see .      to account for the changing effective survey volume for galaxies of different brightnesses and sed shapes",
    ", we use the v@xmath46 method @xcite .",
    "this weights galaxies according to the fraction of the survey volume in which they could have been observed , given their brightness and the shape of their sed .",
    "the latter point is important : galaxies with different sed shapes are visible in different survey volumes and this must be correctly accounted for in the v@xmath47 calculation @xcite . using the same library of models as used in the stellar mass determination ( see above )",
    ", the best fit model was scaled to the observed galaxy magnitude and shifted in redshift to determine the total redshift path in which the galaxy would have been seen , given the survey magnitude limits .",
    "the snr limit alters slightly the effective @xmath38 magnitude limits of the survey , because very few galaxies with apparent magnitudes above 23 have spectra with a snr greater than our limit of 6.5 .",
    "we therefore redefine the survey magnitude range to be @xmath26 and remove galaxies from our sample which fall outside of these limits .",
    "the survey area is calculated from the photometric survey mask , combined with the boundaries of the spectroscopic survey region .",
    "the total survey area is 0.472 sq .",
    "degrees which corresponds to a survey volume in the redshift range @xmath0 of @xmath48mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the galaxies in which we are interested are those in which a dominant a / f star population is visible , implying that the formation of o and early b type stars has ceased suddenly .",
    "such galaxies are identifiable by their strong balmer absorption lines compared to their mean stellar age as measured by their 4000  break strength .",
    "the traditional method for identifying post - starburst galaxies involves the selection of objects with both a strong balmer absorption line ( usually h@xmath49 or h@xmath50 ) to identify a recent starburst , and no detectable nebular emission ( usually [ oii ] or h@xmath51 , although see balogh & morris [ 2000 ] ) to ensure no ongoing star formation .",
    "our selection differs primarily by not placing limits on nebular emission , as we do not want to bias our sample against narrow line agn which are enhanced in the post - starburst population @xcite .",
    "the additional use of the 4000  break strength allows us to select galaxies with older and weaker post - starburst features .    following the method of @xcite",
    "we employ a principal component analysis ( pca ) of the spectra around the 4000  break to measure the strength of the balmer lines with sufficient snr . in @xcite",
    "the new spectral indices were defined based upon stellar population synthesis models to avoid contamination of the indices by gaseous emission from the galaxies . because of the low spectral resolution of the vvds spectra , in this work we are unable to accurately mask the balmer emission lines which fall in the center of the balmer absorption lines in which we are interested .",
    "therefore , we choose to perform the pca directly on the vvds spectra themselves . in section [ sec : models ] we explain how we compare a posteriori to model stellar populations created with a population synthesis code .      4000 index .",
    "the second index contains the balmer absorption line series from h@xmath50 to h@xmath52 , together with the distinctive decrease in flux bluewards of 3850  seen in late b to f - star spectra . ]",
    "all galaxy spectra in our sample are corrected for galactic extinction assuming a uniform e(b@xmath53v)@xmath54 , moved to the galaxy rest - frame and interpolated onto a common wavelength grid .",
    "each spectrum is normalised , by dividing by the median flux between 3750 and 4140 .",
    "the mean spectrum is calculated and subtracted and a pca is then performed on the residuals . because pca is a least - squares process , eigenspectra calculated directly from data can easily be dominated by outliers in the input sample of spectra . in order to obtain robust eigenspectra that are representative of the majority of the population , we use an iterative and robust pca algorithm @xcite .",
    "the algorithm essentially replaces the least - squares minimisation solved by traditional pca with the minimisation of a new robust function of the data , which employs a robust cauchy - type function to limit the impact of outliers .",
    "the eigenspectra are presented in figure [ fig : espec ] .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , the first eigenspectrum relates to the strength of the 4000  break , and is equivalent to the well - known index d@xmath554000 .",
    "this has been shown to correlate most strongly with the specific star formation rate of the galaxy ( ssfr , star formation rate divided by stellar mass , * ? ? ?",
    "the second index contains the balmer absorption lines , together with the correlated decrease in flux bluewards of 3850  found in late b- to f - type stars .",
    "we calculate the principal component amplitudes ( pcs ) of all galaxies in our sample by projecting the spectra onto the eigenspectra .",
    "the projection is performed using the `` gappy - pca '' procedure of @xcite , which weights pixels by their errors during the projection and gaps in the spectra due to bad pixels are given zero weight .",
    "we additionally allow the normalisation of the spectra to vary as a free parameter in the projection ( g.  lemson private communication , see * ? ? ?",
    "the pcs represent the amount of each eigenspectrum present in a galaxy spectrum and are our new star formation history indices .",
    "errors are calculated during the projection of the spectra onto the eigenspectra , using the error arrays of the individual vvds spectra .",
    "these errors are purely statistical , however , in wild et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) we show that for sdss spectra they compare well to the scatter observed between duplicate observations .              in figure",
    "[ fig : pca ] we show the distribution of pc1 and pc2 for our sample of vvds galaxies . to guide the eye of the reader , and to aid in further discussion , we have split the sample into four `` classes '' , with boundaries empirically defined from the distribution of points .",
    "we would like to emphasise that in reality the star formation histories of galaxies form a continuous distribution , and any separation into discrete classes is an over simplification , greatly reducing the information contained within the full distribution .",
    "the primary division of our sample is into `` quiescent '' and `` star - forming '' galaxies on the right and left , based on the value of pc1 ( i.e. the strength of their 4000break ) .",
    "the precise positioning of the boundary is arbitrary , and care should be taken when comparing our results for `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies to those derived from different observations . to the bottom left ,",
    "systems with very blue continua and very strong emission lines are found , which we class as `` starburst '' galaxies .",
    "finally , to the top center we find the `` post - starburst '' galaxies , with stronger balmer absorption lines than expected for their 4000break strength .",
    "we define `` post - starburst '' galaxies to have @xmath56 and pc2@xmath57 .",
    "while these boundaries were defined empirically from the distribution of data ( this class are clear outliers in pc2 ) , we will later compare with model stellar populations to justify their classification as `` post - starburst '' .",
    "we find that 18 galaxies lie in this region at @xmath58 confidence .",
    "the spectra of these galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the selection of these 18 galaxies is robust to changes in the exact method used to create the eigenspectra .",
    "it is important to estimate the completeness of the survey in terms of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "this of course depends upon the mass - to - light ratio and sed shape of the galaxies in question : flux limited surveys are generally complete to lower mass limits for star forming galaxies than for quiescent galaxies .",
    "while the completeness in a particular photometric band can be judged empirically , this is not possible for the completeness in derived parameters , such as stellar mass and star formation rate .",
    "we therefore use an alternative approach to estimate the mass completeness of our sample , described in detail in w08 .    because we are primarily interested in the post - starburst population , with mass - to - light ratios between those of star - forming and quiescent galaxies , we derive the mass limits relevant for this population alone . from the model dataset described in section [ sec : ms ]",
    "we select all model galaxies which have undergone a starburst in the last gyr and lie within our psb region in pc1/pc2 . for a given stellar mass",
    ", we determine the fraction of model post - starburst galaxies that lie within our survey magnitude limits .",
    "we find that 50% of the model post - starburst galaxies at @xmath59 with @xmath60 would be detected , and @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "the stochastic model library assumed in this analysis has a higher fraction of strong post - starburst galaxies than appear in the real data , i.e. while the observational pc1/pc2 space is fully covered by the models , the relative space density of the different galaxy types is not reliable .",
    "we therefore confirmed that the mass completeness limits did not vary greatly with burst mass fraction or burst age .    in the following sections , all results will be quoted for a mass limit of @xmath63 .",
    "we have confirmed that increasing this limit to @xmath64 does not alter our conclusions .",
    "figure [ fig : pca ] ( right ) shows the number density of galaxies in bins of pc1/2 for galaxies with @xmath63 , corrected for survey volume and sampling effects .",
    "in order to understand the particular properties of a starburst which would lead to a post - starburst galaxy in our sample , and to measure the timescale during which a post - starburst galaxy is visible , it is necessary to compare our data with model stellar populations .",
    "we begin by creating simple toy model starbursts and subsequently turn to the analysis of smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of merging galaxies .",
    "for a galaxy to reveal strong balmer absorption lines , star formation must switch off rapidly resulting in an excess of longer lived a- and f - stars over the hotter o- and early b - stars .",
    "this does not necessarily have to be preceded by a short - lived starburst , the sudden truncation of ordinary star formation will suffice , although the signature will of course be weaker .",
    "the two parameters of importance for the strength and longevity of the post - starburst phase are the mass fraction of stars formed in a starburst and the decay timescale of the starburst . in this terminology , a truncation model then simply has a mass fraction of zero per cent .    with this in mind we have created a library of model galaxies which undergo exponentially decaying bursts , occurring after 5gyr of continuous star formation .",
    "these bursts are parameterised by their decay time and burst mass fraction , i.e. the mass of stars formed while the star formation rate is above the continuum level .    converting the star formation histories into spectra suitable for comparison with the vvds dataset",
    "requires several steps .",
    "we input the star formation histories into the galaxev code @xcite , using charlot & bruzual ( in preparation ) simple - stellar - populations ( ssps ) , a @xcite imf and assuming solar metallicity .",
    "the evolution of the model galaxies in pc1/2 is not greatly affected by the change between @xcite and charlot & bruzual ( in preparation ) ssps , which involves both a change in stellar libraries and in the stellar evolution tracks .",
    "solar metallicity was chosen as being suitable for our post - starburst galaxy sample , given their stellar masses ( section [ sec : physprop ] ) , but the evolutionary tracks are insensitive to moderate variations in metallicity .",
    "the two component dust prescription of @xcite is applied to the continuum light as implemented in the galaxev code .",
    "again , the inclusion or not of continuum dust has little effect on the time spent on the psb sequence , or the maximum pc2 observed .",
    "this is because the dominant a / f star population in the post - starburst spectra is assumed to already have emerged from the dense stellar birth clouds .",
    "next , because the resolution of the vvds spectra is too low to mask emission lines in the data , we must add emission lines to the model spectra .",
    "we convert the rate of ionising photons predicted by the stellar population synthesis model ( @xmath65 ) into h@xmath51 line flux using : @xmath66 =   0.45 * e_{h\\alpha}[erg ] * q_{ion}[s^{-1}]\\ ] ] where e@xmath67 is the energy of a h@xmath51 photon and 0.45 is the fraction of ionisations which lead to the emission of an h@xmath51 recombination photon ( case b , @xmath68k and @xmath69@xmath70 , * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining balmer line fluxes are derived from the ratios given in @xcite .",
    "the stellar population synthesis model includes the post - agb phase of stellar evolution which is believed to be important for producing ionising photons in older stellar populations .",
    "we note that no contribution to the emission lines from obscured , narrow - line agn is included in the models .",
    "any substantial infilling of the balmer absorption lines in this way will prevent us from identifying post - starburst galaxies .",
    "agn with strong enough lines to have a significant effect are extremely rare however , and their absence from our sample will not affect our final results .    just as dust attenuation is applied to the model stellar continua , the lines are similarly attenuated using the attenuation law as described in @xcite : @xmath71 this law is inspired by the two - component dust model of @xcite . for the birth clouds , from which nebular emission is believed to originate and which contain a fraction @xmath72 of the dust , these authors adopted for simplicity an attenuation law to match that of the diffuse interstellar medium ( i.e. of the form @xmath73 ) .",
    "our slightly steeper curve , resulting in slightly increased attenuation , is motivated by the fact that dense clouds around young stars have a more shell - like geometry than the diffuse interstellar medium ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",

    "we will use this value as an upper limit on @xmath75 in later sections .",
    "we conclude from this section that the majority of the progenitors of our psb galaxies underwent a recent strong starburst , followed by a rapid truncation of the star formation",

    "the next step in our comparison with models involves a sample of 79 merger simulations presented in ( * ? ? ?",

    "further details concerning the feedback implementations and parameter choices can be found in jnb09 .",
    "in addition , for the purposes of this paper a new suite of simulations was performed in which the bh feedback was switched off .",
    "such a comparison is important because the bh feedback can cause star formation to completely shut down after the merger , which may plausibly affect both the time the merger remnant spends in the psb phase , and the strength of the post - starburst features .",
    "the simulations include mergers of gas - rich disks ( sp - sp ) , of early - type galaxies and disks ( e - sp , mixed mergers ) , and mergers of early - type galaxies ( e - e , dry mergers ) .",
    "the progenitor galaxies have a range of virial velocities , @xmath83 of 80 , 160 , 320 and 500km / s , which determines their masses and sizes ( see eqs . 1 & 2 in jnb09 ) . all model galaxies contain an exponential disk ( @xmath84 ) component , together with a stellar bulge ( @xmath85 ) embedded in a dark matter halo modelled with the @xcite profile .",

    "the resulting merger remnants have total stellar masses between @xmath91 . both major ( 1:1 ) and minor ( 3:1 ) mergers",
    "were simulated with varying orbital and initial disk geometries @xcite .",
    "all simulations were evolved for a total of @xmath92 , with the merger taking place after approximately 1.5gyr , using the local altix 3700 bx2 machine hosted at the university observatory in munich . in this paper we will primarily concentrate on mergers with prograde in - plane orbits (  g0  , i.e. the galaxies collide directly edge on * ? ? ?",
    "we will additionally show an example in which galaxies rotate in a retrograde sense , with the disks tilted by 30 degrees with respect to one another ( `` g7 '' ) .",
    "we will focus exclusively on the sp - sp mergers , as all other pair combinations were found not to produce the strength of psb galaxy visible to us in the data .",
    "as the simulations , and thus star formation rates , are only computed over a total duration of 3gyr , we must assume a star formation history and galaxy age for the initial build up of stellar mass in each progenitor galaxy .",
    "we assume that by the start of the simulation each galaxy has built both its bulge and disk stellar mass through an exponentially declining star formation rate : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",

    "we note that any similar star formation history can be assumed with which to build the pre - merger galaxies , without significantly affecting their evolution in the post - merger post - starburst phase .",

    "to bottom panel the mass of the progenitor galaxies increases .",
    "the sfhs of the major merger simulations in general follow similar patterns , with an initial weak enhancement in their star formation , quickly followed by the starburst and decay to zero star formation .",
    "we parameterise the simulations using two simple values to describe the evolution of the starburst .",
    "firstly , the burst mass fraction @xmath99 , defined as the mass of stars formed while the sfr is at least 1.05 times the continuum rate , divided by the total mass of the final merger remnant .",

    "the second parameter is the decay time of the starburst , @xmath100 , defined to be the time from the peak of the starburst until the sfr is only 10% of the maximum burst height .",
    "these values are shown in the top left of each sfh panel in figure [ fig : simn1 ] .",
    "as found using the toy - models , higher gas fractions lead to stronger post - starburst features and longer periods of time spent in the post - starburst phase .    using this suite of simulations we can investigate several other initial conditions which affect the evolution of the stellar population of the merger remnant : progenitor mass ratio ; orbital geometry ; presence or absence of a black hole .",
    "we illustrate the latter two in figure [ fig : simn2 ] .",
    "the left two panels show the star formation history and evolutionary tracks in pc1/2 for galaxies with tilted orbital configurations and @xmath97 . comparing to the left panels of figure [ fig : simn1 ]",
    "we see that in this particular suite of simulations , only the prograde edge - on mergers give rise to post - starburst features . while the starbursts are weaker in the other orbital configurations , it is likely that the main cause of the difference is in the longer decay times of the star formation rate .",
    "however , we caution that the tilted orbital geometries tested here have typical tilts of @xmath101 degrees and are retrograde .",
    "other relevant parameters , such as impact parameter , galactic structure and variations in stellar feedback prescription have not been investigated . while the simulations indicate that a relatively strong interaction is required to produce a post - starburst galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* jnb09 ) , a full study of the post - merger stellar populations as a function of impact geometries is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the right two panels of figure [ fig : simn2 ] show the evolution of the stellar population with bh feedback `` switched - off '' and @xmath102 . comparing to the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : simn1 ]",
    "we see that the burst mass fractions and time spent in the post - starburst phase are similar with or without the presence of bh feedback .",
    "the primary causes of the shut - down in star formation are supernovae feedback and exhaustion of gas supplies , rather than any additional energy supplied by the agn . in two out of three cases",
    "the post - starburst features are stronger when bh feedback aids in expelling the gas , but the main effect is focused on the later stages of the burst where any residual star formation is halted more quickly . therefore , we conclude that from these spectral indices alone , there is no way to confirm or refute the suggestion that strong bh feedback provides the mechanism for shutting off star formation in the universe .    in figure",

    "the results paint a very similar picture to that shown by the toy - models , but we can now associate burst mass fractions to physically meaningful parameters such as gas fractions and galaxy masses .",
    "we find that mergers must induce burst mass fractions of at least 5% for them to be detectable in our observationally defined psb phase , and the time spent there is greater for more gas rich and more massive mergers . for a 3:1 merger ( open symbols ) to appear in the psb phase , a very high gas fraction of 80%",
    "is apparently required .",
    "the duration of the post - starburst phase tends to a maximum of 0.6gyr , with lower gas fractions leading to shorter timescales of 0.3 - 0.4gyr and burst mass fractions of 5 - 10% .",

    "in the preceding sections we have culled a sample of post - starburst galaxies with @xmath0 from the vvds redshift survey . through comparisons with toy models and sph galaxy merger simulations , we have shown how the spectroscopic features indicate that the galaxies have undergone a recent major , gas rich merger . in this section",

    "this latter property of the sdss survey means that the spectra only probe the central regions of nearby , or massive , galaxies , with a strong redshift dependence . for our comparative census of post - starburst galaxies",
    "this is problematic as there is currently no known way to robustly detect post - starburst features from optical photometry alone .",
    "thus , it is not possible to know for sure whether the proceeding starburst was nuclear or global , the former being unlikely to be connected to the build up of the red sequence . at @xmath143",
    "the fibre corresponds to a physical diameter of about 3kpc ( @xmath144 ) , which is small compared to the size of a galaxy , but is considerably larger than the extent of a nuclear starburst @xcite .",
    "a remaining limitation caused by the aperture bias of sdss , is that post - starburst populations may fail to be identified due to population gradients within the galaxies .",
    "assuming disks are more likely to undergo starbursts than bulges , this would cause us to underestimate the number of psb galaxies .",
    "volume corrections and stellar masses of the galaxies are measured in the same way as for the vvds sample ( section [ sec : volume ] ) , using the combined ukidss and sdss photometry . one final piece of information required is the target sampling rate of sdss .",
    "although the sdss aims for 100% coverage in the spectroscopic catalogue , one of a pair of neighbouring galaxies is occasionally not targeted , due to the problem of placing fibres close together on a plate .",
    "similarly , densely populated regions of the sky may suffer from partial coverage due to there being insufficient fibres available to cover the area .",

    "we find that the targeting success rate is 90% .",
    "we calculate weights for the galaxies by combining this value with the fraction with spectra above the snr limit described above .      to calculate the principal components for the sdss spectra , we first correct for galactic extinction , convert to air wavelengths , convolve the spectra to vvds resolution and finally rebin onto the eigenspectra binning .",

    "we can compare our low redshift psb mass flux to that calculated by @xcite for galaxies in the green valley .",
    "they assumed that green valley galaxies defined in nuv - r colours in an sdss / galex matched catalogue are all entering the red sequence ( i.e. all the mass flows from blue - to - red ) to calculate a transition mass flux of @xmath153m@xmath7/mpc@xmath3/yr .",
    "clearly , this value is considerably greater ( a factor of 1,000 ) than our post - starburst mass flux .",
    "if the assumption that all green valley galaxies are heading towards the red - sequence is correct , then the post - starburst pathway to the red sequence appears truly unimportant in the present - day universe .",
    "some of this discrepancy may be reduced by appealing to the differing mass limits of the two samples .",
    "for example , @xcite studied a sample of post - starburst galaxies in the sdss , using a similar magnitude limit to that of @xcite , which includes many lower mass galaxies than in our sample .",
    "they measured the `` rate density '' for post - starburst galaxies in the sdss , i.e. the number of galaxies which pass through the post - starburst phase , to be @xmath154/mpc@xmath3/gyr .",
    "the equivalent value for our high - mass sample is @xmath155/mpc@xmath3/gyr strongly suggesting that the measured post - starburst mass flux would increase were we to relax our mass limit .",
    "in this paper we have presented a sample of galaxies with strong balmer absorption lines and , through comparison with simulations , have argued that these are the likely descendants of gas - rich major mergers .",
    "the strength of their spectral features suggest that they are post - starburst galaxies with burst mass fractions of at least 5 - 10% .",
    "however , irrespective of whether a starburst has occurred , it is certain that their star - formation has been quenched quickly with a timescale of @xmath790.10.2gyr . as discussed briefly in section [ sec : intro ] , such fast quenching times are generally associated with supernovae feedback after periods of rapid star formation induced by galaxy collisions .",
    "an alternative scenario may be rapid fueling of star formation in galaxies from filamentary cold - gas flows @xcite , although direct comparisons with the outputs of these simulations would be required to test this .",
    "one popular theory for the origin of the red sequence and the relation between galaxy bulge mass and central supermassive black hole mass is through the triggering of massive outflows driven by the central black hole .",
    "such outflows would quickly halt star formation and therefore the theory suggests an evolutionary link between qsos and post - starburst galaxies .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the number density of the post - starburst galaxies to that of qsos at the same redshift .",
    "any meaningful comparison requires knowledge of the qso lifetime and the visibility time of the post - starburst galaxies .",
    "the former has been estimated using a variety of methods to be @xmath156 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and we assume @xmath157gyr as previously . setting @xmath158 we can estimate the magnitude limit of the qsos , @xmath159 , which leads to a space density matching the observed space density of post - starburst galaxies of @xmath160/mpc@xmath3 . using the parameterised qso luminosity function of @xcite at @xmath161 , we find @xmath162 where the magnitudes are @xmath163band and vega zero - point . that the number density of strong post - starburst galaxies coincides with that of moderately powerful qsos , 1.5 magnitudes fainter than @xmath120",
    ", does not of course necessarily imply an evolutionary link .",
    "the agn luminosity function continues to rise to fainter magnitudes @xcite and uncovering the triggering mechanisms of agn as a function of luminosity remains one of the biggest observational challenges for extragalactic astronomy .",
    "the number density of the post - starburst galaxies evolves rapidly . extrapolating the evolution of the qso luminosity function of @xcite to @xmath164 , and taking @xmath165 as before",
    ", we find a qso number density of @xmath166mpc@xmath167 above the same magnitude limit of @xmath168 , a factor of a few below the @xmath161 number density .",
    "so current results suggest that the evolution in number density of qsos is not as strong as the evolution in the psb number density . to our knowledge ,",
    "an observed qso luminosity function at @xmath169 is not currently available , and would be required for a more detailed comparison .",
    "if , as we have suggested , the strong post - starburst galaxies selected in this paper are the result of major mergers , it is instructive to compare the number of post - starburst galaxies to the number of close galaxy pairs in the same survey volume .",
    "@xcite measure the fraction of close spectroscopic pairs to derive the merger rate using the same vvds galaxy sample as in this paper . for galaxies with @xmath170",
    "they derive a merger rate of @xmath171mpc@xmath167gyr@xmath20 , with a magnitude difference criteria such that they are sensitive to mergers with mass ratios @xmath824:1 .",
    "this can be compared with the number of post - starburst galaxies , divided by the time during which they are detectable i.e. @xmath172mpc@xmath167gyr@xmath20 for @xmath1730.35gyr .",
    "given the small number statistics of both samples , uncertainty in both merger and psb timescales and the problem of the unknown magnitude difference between the psb progenitors , it is encouraging that these numbers are so close .",
    "of course , larger samples and further detailed observations of the post - starburst galaxies will greatly aid our understanding of their origin and possible link to gas - rich major mergers .",
    "as with the qso number density , the current estimates of the evolution in merger rate with redshift show less evolution than observed in the psb number density . although @xcite find that the evolution with redshift is stronger for lower luminosity and lower mass galaxies , with the merger rate decreasing by a factor of two between a redshift of 1 and 0.5 , this is still not as strong as the evolution in psb number density",
    "finally , we note that out of the 36 close galaxy pairs identified by @xcite one galaxy is part of the post - starburst sample of this paper .",
    "given the small probability of a chance coincidence , this suggests that in at least one case the post - starburst stellar population is linked with tidal disruption caused by an ongoing major merger .    the strong evolution in psb number ( and mass ) density compared to the evolution of both qso number density and galaxy major merger rate , leads us to the question of what may cause such a sharp decline in the number of post - starburst galaxies . through our comparison with merger simulations , we have identified two important factors in creating a post - starburst galaxy : gas mass fraction and timescale of the starburst .",
    "larger gas mass fractions provide more fuel for the starburst , leading to stronger and more prolonged post - starburst signatures . because gas is used - up in the formation of stars , it is reasonable to assume that gas mass fraction decreases with decreasing redshift , a fact that may play a leading role in the global decrease of star formation rate density since @xmath12 .",
    "a second effect is the starburst timescale , which is generally assumed to be linked to the disk dynamical timescale , which in turn is linked to the dynamical time of the halo .",
    "this latter value is known to increase with redshift , by a factor of 2 between a redshift of 1 and 0 ( e. neistein priv .",
    "a lengthening of the duration of the starbursts , together with a decreasing amount of fuel available , may be the dominant mechanism responsible for the decrease in number density of post - starburst galaxies . clearly further simulations will be required to test these ideas .      given the possible link of psb galaxies to gas - rich major mergers , it is interesting to investigate the local environments of the galaxies .",
    "measured the density on 5 and 8@xmath174mpc scales around galaxies in the vvds survey .",
    "of the 16 psb galaxies with @xmath63 , 15 have available density measures .",
    "a control sample of 2122 vvds galaxies with good quality redshift flags was selected for comparison .",
    "we do not detect any significant difference in the mean or median densities around the psb galaxies , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "it is , however , interesting to see that the spread in local density values for the psb sample is very large . in detail , 3 lie in underdense environments ( @xmath175 ) , 9 in normally overdense environments ( @xmath176 , while the median value for the control sample is @xmath177 ) and 3 in strongly overdense environments ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is no clear trend between star - forming vs. non - star - forming psb galaxies .",
    "the presence of psb galaxies in all types of environment will be an important constraint for understanding their origin and evolution .",
    "in section [ sec : massflux ] we compared the mass flux through the post - starburst phase to the mass build  up of the red sequence as measured by .",
    "we found a value of @xmath8140% for psbs with no residual star formation , or 80% for all psbs with @xmath63 .",
    "these numbers , although consistent ( i.e. not greater than 100% ) , perhaps still appear surprisingly high if we expect other quenching mechanisms with slower timescales to also play a role in moving mass onto the red sequence @xcite . the key question is whether there is a one  way flow of galaxies from the blue to the red sequence ? what prevents a galaxy from re - starting star formation due to subsequent inflow of gas after experiencing a major merger ?",
    "sph simulations of galaxy mergers invoke strong mechanical agn feedback to prevent subsequent star formation and allow the galaxy to remain on the red - sequence . the large amount of mass flowing to the red sequence through the post - starburst phase at high redshift ,",
    "may in fact cause us to question the fact that strong mechanical feedback is effective in the long - term for the majority of galaxies .",
    "semi - analytic cosmological models provide one method to test galaxy formation scenarios in a full cosmological context and could help to understand the directions of mass fluxes .",
    "a full comparison of the recent star formation histories of the vvds and sdss galaxies presented in this paper with semi - analytic models is underway .",
    "a full census of different types of transition galaxies as a function of redshift , when combined with accurate measurements of the mass densities on the blue and red sequence , will help to reveal the true importance of mechanical gas expulsion mechanisms ( feedback ) on the global evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "we have found that strong post - starburst galaxies have stellar masses similar to those of the least massive galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "this has important implications for our understanding of the physical processes involved in the build - up of the red sequence , and in particular the subsequent role of dry - mergers in forming the shape of the red sequence mass function observed today @xcite .",
    "using a pca analysis of the spectra of the vvds deep spectroscopic galaxy survey , we have selected a sample of 16 galaxies with strong balmer absorption lines at @xmath0 and above a mass completeness limit of @xmath63 . through comparison with a suite of sph merger simulations and toy starburst models",
    "we have shown that these galaxies are likely to have undergone a strong starburst within the last few tenths of a gyr , with burst mass fractions of order 10% , similar to those derived for lirgs at these redshifts .",
    "the key requirement for the observation of the post - starburst galaxies , is a fast quenching timescale of @xmath179gyr .",
    "we show that there is a maximum visible lifetime for the post - starburst galaxies of 0.6gyr , but for lower gas mass fractions of @xmath8120 - 40% a lifetime of 0.35gyr is more likely .",
    "the key results of this paper are :    * * number density : * psb galaxies with @xmath63 have a number density of @xmath180 per mpc@xmath3 .",
    "assuming they are visible for an average of 0.35gyr , and that a qso shines for @xmath181 years , this is equal to the number density of qsos brighter than @xmath182 @xcite . * * masses and mass density : * summing all the mass in the post - starburst population gives a mass density of @xmath183 .",
    "the mass distribution of the psb galaxies rises to the mass completeness limit of @xmath63 , therefore measuring the complete mass distribution for post - starburst galaxies at @xmath11 will require a deeper survey .",
    "the true mass distribution is crucial for understanding the relative importance of different mechanisms for causing post - starburst galaxies @xcite . * * mass flux : * we select the 5 psb galaxies with no residual star formation according to multiwavelength sed fitting . taking 0.6gyr as an upper limit on the visibility time of the psb galaxies",
    "gives a lower limit on the mass flux of @xmath184 m@xmath7/mpc@xmath3/yr .",
    "taking our best estimate for @xmath75 of 0.35gyr gives @xmath185 m@xmath7/mpc@xmath3/yr . comparing this to the rate of build up of the red sequence , we find @xmath8% of the growth of the red sequence at @xmath133 takes place from galaxies which have passed through the strong post - starburst phase , assuming all these galaxies subsequently remain on the red sequence .",
    "* * environment : * we use the local density on @xmath186mpc scales from to show that psb galaxies are found in all environments , from underdense to strongly overdense . * * low vs. high @xmath28 : * we compare our high - redshift results to a sample of galaxies with @xmath9 selected from the sdss and ukidss surveys . despite the enormous increase in sample size",
    ", only 3 post - starburst galaxies of the same strength as in the vvds sample are detected for the same mass limit .",
    "we find the mass density of strong post - starburst galaxies decreases by a factor of 230 and number density by a factor of 200 from @xmath11 to @xmath10 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "this paper finds that post - starburst galaxies , although rare in the local universe , are of global importance at higher redshift . with larger and deeper spectroscopic surveys , exciting new constraints could be obtained on the processes which drive galaxy evolution .",
