    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , interaction of particle spin or pseudospin with the orbital motion , provides an efficient way to control and manipulate spin , charge , and mass transport .",
    "two different kinds of so coupled systems attract a great deal of interest due to the known and yet unexplored variety of phenomena they can demonstrate and due to their possible applications in quantum technologies .",
    "one class of systems , investigated for more than five decades by now , is semiconductors and semiconductor - based nanostructures @xcite .",
    "the other class , lavished attention only recently , is cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates , where by engineering external optical fields one can couple orbital motion to the pseudospin degree of freedom @xcite and cause dresselhaus and rashba types of so coupling similar to that in solids .",
    "in quantum systems of interest the tunneling plays an important role and either completely determines or strongly influences the particle dynamics . at certain conditions the tunneling rate depends on the spin of the particle @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the tunneling is the key for the understanding of the transient processes in a broad variety of systems , including , e.g. charge transport in molecular nanostructures @xcite .",
    "one of the key issues in the tunneling theory is the evaluation of the time spent by the particle in the classically forbidden regions .",
    "similar to the scattering problem of propagating wave packets , the question of the tunneling time for the decay of a metastable system @xcite may also be posed .",
    "the spin - dependent effects based on the larmor clock concept for potential barriers @xcite , hartman effect in graphene @xcite , and effective exchange fields in semiconductors @xcite can provide a measure of this time . in classically forbidden regions there is not only precession but also a rotation of the magnetic moment into the magnetic field direction and the time of the interaction with the barrier is closely related to this rotation @xcite .",
    "the effects of so coupling on the tunneling through semiconductor quantum - well structures with a lateral potential barrier @xcite provide another tool to utilize electron spin modifying the charge transport in nonmagnetic systems .    here",
    "we investigate the spin - dependent tunneling of a state initially localized in the potential at short and long compared to the state lifetime time scales @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian and formulate the physical observables of interest .",
    "we use the su(2 ) spin rotation to gauge out spin - orbit coupling and restore its effects in the calculation of the observables by inverse transformation . in sec .",
    "iii we study the dynamics at short time scale , concentrating on spin oscillations , decay , and escape from the localizing potential . in sec .",
    "iv we study long - term dynamics in the far - field zone . the diffraction in time in spin density",
    "is observed at a long distance , where so coupling forms a precursor in the propagating density .",
    "we show that the tunneling can be characterized not only by time , but also by a certain length parameter , which can be accessed by detecting the spin precession due to the so coupling .",
    "conclusions summarize the results .",
    "as a model we consider shown in fig.[model ] time - dependent potential @xmath0 infinite at @xmath1 , with the time - dependence : @xmath2 at @xmath3 the potential holds bound states with wave functions @xmath4 and energy @xmath5 ; it changes at @xmath6 from a step to a barrier to allow the tunneling .",
    "such time - dependent potential can be produced by a recently developed technique @xcite where a moving laser beam `` paints '' a broad variety of coordinate- and time - dependent potentials .",

    "the spatial scale of spin precession is characterized by the length @xmath22 .",

    "cm / s , we obtain @xmath32 cm .",
    "it is interesting to mention that although masses and coupling constants for electrons in nanostructures and cold atoms are very different , the resulting precession length is on the same order of magnitude for all these systems . since typical localization scale of electrons in nanostructures",
    "@xmath33 is on the order of @xmath34 cm , they are in the weak - coupling regime with @xmath35 .",
    "cold atoms , however , are localized on the scale of the order visible light wavelength , that is of @xmath36 cm , and the strong so coupling regime with @xmath37 can be achieved there .",
    "the characteristic timescale corresponding to the particle motion inside the potential , @xmath38 , is on the order of 0.1 - 1 ps for electrons in nanostructures and 0.1 - 1 ms for cold atoms .",
