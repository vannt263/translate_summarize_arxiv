    "historically , economical crises are known to have a great impact on our society ; it is now most important to devise new ways to model and possibly prevent such events .",
    "one appropriate method to accomplish this task is to apply the boltzmann equation onto these matters .",
    "kinetic theory can be used to describe the evolution of phenomena such as flocking behavior and speculative markets .",
    "because of its multi - agent nature , kinetic theory is apt to describe such systems that also have multiple interacting variables .",
    "moreover , the relationship between the time among interactions ( in finance , the time taken by a stock to change its price ) and the characteristic macroscopic times ( trading hours ) yields a suitable knudsen number which will characterize the appropriate hydrodynamic regime .",
    "information theory proposes that statistical mechanics can be considered as an application of the broader formalism of mathematical statistics @xcite @xcite .",
    "accordingly , most methods of kinetic theory which rely on a maximum ( information ) entropy principle are subject to be non - exclusively applied to physics . in fact , the basic ideas of _ econophysics _ are based on probabilistic and statistical methods taken from statistical physics . in both information theory and statistical mechanics",
    "the quantity @xmath0 represents an entropy that upon maximization allows the establishment of a least - biased distribution function . in this sense ,",
    "the concept of entropy is not limited to the scope of physics .",
    "+   + classical kinetic theory leads to a set of partial equations that describe the evolution of averaged quantities corresponding to the main properties of a given physical microscopic system ; these are called _ transport equations_. the starting point is a master equation ( i.e. the boltzmann equation ) that describes the state variables through the evolution of the distribution function of single particles . when the boltzmann equation is multiplied by the collisional invariant @xmath1 and integrated in the velocity space , the resulting equation is called _ enskog transport equation_. the distribution function allows to compute averages at different regimes in terms of an order parameter which in hydrodynamics is called the knudsen number @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this parameter is given by the proportion between the mean free time and the characteristic time , thus the distribution function can be written in terms of powers of @xmath2 . the _ euler regime",
    "_ corresponds to averages taken with respect to the equilibrium distribution function , while the _ navier - stokes _ transport equations are obtained at order @xmath2 .",

    "the bgk model is the basic tool to be used in this paper . despite its simplicity ,",
    "it is able to describe the evolution of a set of particles towards their equilibrium state predicting useful , verifiable results .",
    "this type of kernel is not restricted to collisional processes , its form predicts an evolution to the equilibrium distribution function in a characteristic time @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the method of establishing transport equations in terms of powers of a knudsen number does not depend on physical or mechanical laws but in maximum information entropy and stochastic processes considerations .",
    "therefore the mechanism appears to be appropriate to be applied in any situation describable by averages over distribution functions taken out of equilibrium in terms of powers of the knudsen parameter .",
    "hence it is interesting to establish a generic set of transport equations , both in its non - linear and its linearized forms , in order to apply the vast range of results of hydrodynamics to a large set of interdisciplinary situations such as financial markets and biophysics .",

    "this section is included in order to make the paper self - contained , so that the reader can appreciate the limits of the analogies here proposed . in section three , the generic set of linearized transport equations for an interdisciplinary case",
    "is written in terms of three basic state variables not necessarily related to hydrodynamics .",
    "it is compelling to notice that in this representation , there is no need to identify physical - type parameters such as the atomic mass or boltzmann s constant .",
    "finally , section four is devoted to a discussion of the formalism proposed in this work .",
    "most of the material comprised in this section refers to a particular case of a general approach to kinetic theory included in classic references of the subject @xcite .",
