    "the random geometric graph is a simple stochastic model , first studied in @xcite in 1972 , for generating a graph : given the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath9 , consider a poisson point process of intensity @xmath2 on the unit torus , equipped with some norm @xmath10 , and declare an edge between any two vertices that are distance @xmath11 from each other .    unlike the well - known erds ",
    "rnyi random graph , the random geometric graph s definition leads to strong dependence between edges : if three vertices form a `` v '' shaped graph , they are far more likely to have the third edge of the triangle than if no assumption were made on the other edges , as a consequence of the triangle inequality",
    ".    many properties of this graph model have been studied .",
    "the classic monograph of mathew penrose @xcite studies results pertaining to many graph - theoretical functions of random geometric graphs , including ( but not limited to ) laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for subgraph counts , independence number , and chromatic number , as well as many properties connected to the giant component .",
    "many of the results presented in this monograph have been improved and generalized by penrose and his coauthors in the 12 years since its initial publication . besides this , there have been investigations into other probabilistic features , such as threshold functions for cover times and mixing times @xcite and a characterization of sharp thresholds for many monotone graph functions @xcite .",
    "this list is far from comprehensive , of course , and the random geometric graph is still an active research area .",
    "the random geometric graph is also highly related to the random connection continuum percolation model . in that model ,",
    "the vertex set is given by an ( almost surely infinite ) poisson point process of fixed intensity on @xmath12 , and two points are connected with some probability that varies ( and usually decreases ) with their distance . in particular , the special case in which the radius of connection is deterministically fixed at 1 was the model that initiated the study of this kind of random geometry , in the seminal paper of gilbert @xcite .",
    "the objects of interest in this model are the existence of an infinite connected component , as well as the behavior of the subset of @xmath12 that is at distance at most 1 from one of the vertices of the graph ( the so - called `` poisson blob '' ) .",
    "continuum percolation is treated in detail in a book - length monograph by meester and roy @xcite , as well as in the more general work of grimmett @xcite .",
    "most of the work done on random geometric graphs is concerned with either the behavior of a typical graph  the graph we are likely to see for a given @xmath9 as @xmath2 goes to infinity  or typical deviations from that behavior , i.e. central limit theorems . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the behavior of the model conditioned on a rare event .",
    "specifically , we are concerned with the random geometric graph conditioned on having more edges than is expected ( a formal description will follow ) .",
    "the large deviation regime of the upper tail of any subgraph count of the random geometric graph is not well studied , though some bounds are available : janson @xcite has studied concentration inequalities for @xmath13-statistics , a general class of statistics which includes the subgraph counts we are interested in .",
    "these upper bounds work in very general settings , but are not tight , even up to constants in the exponent .",
    "large deviation principles have been proven for functionals of random point processes in which the contribution of any particular vertex is uniformly bounded @xcite , but no such bound is known for functionals with possibly large influence , such as the edge count of the graph .",
    "as motivation for this detailed study , we consider the problem in a more familiar context : the  infamous upper tail \" @xcite of the triangle count @xmath14 in the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph , @xmath15 .",
    "after many years of development of increasingly strong bounds , the first breakthrough was made by kim and vu @xcite and janson @xcite independently , who proved that , for any @xmath6 and whenever @xmath16 , @xmath17 \\leq \\mathbb{p}[t > ( 1 + \\delta)\\mathbb{e}[t ] ] \\leq \\exp[- c(\\delta ) n^2 p^2 ] \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend only on @xmath20 .",
    "recently , there has been renewed interest in these type of tail estimates . in 2010 , chatterjee @xcite and demarco and kahn @xcite ( in independent works ) established the correct order of the upper tail of triangles and other small cliques by adding the missing logarithmic term to the upper bound , without providing good control of the leading - order constants .",
    "the recent work of chatterjee and dembo @xcite on nonlinear large deviations allowed lubetzky and zhao @xcite to calculate both the order and the leading - order constant for the upper tail question in a certain regime of sparse erds ",
    "rnyi random graphs .",
    "unfortunately , the technique is based on the analysis of polynomials in bernoulli random variables , and thus ill - suited to the problem we are studying here .    in this work",
    ", we use the structure of the random geometric graph to evaluate the upper tail large deviation rate function .",
    "in addition , we provide a  structure theorem \" to describe the graph - theoretical structure of the model conditioned on having too many edges .",
    "specifically , we show that such a conditional model exhibits _",
    "heuristically , this phenomenon can be described as a scenario in which a small number of vertices will contribute almost all the extra edges that we require the graph to exhibit , while the edge count of the `` bulk '' of the graph of the graph will remain largely unchanged , in some weak sense .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the geometry of the localized region has the shape of a ball in the given norm ( we will make these two statements more precise at the end of the next section ) .",
    "outside of the aforementioned work of lubetzky and zhao @xcite in the erds  rnyi model , which is only known for a limited range of @xmath21 s , this work is the first ( as far as the authors are aware ) to establish that the large deviation regime of a subgraph count is ( weakly ) equivalent to planting a combinatorial structure in the usual , unconditional graph .",
    "the fact that large deviation regimes may be dominated by configurations with a small number of very large contributions was known relatively early in the history of large deviation theory : a survey by nagaev @xcite , summarizing a series of papers written in the soviet union in the 1960 s and 70 s , includes this observation for sums of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with stretched - exponential tails as a corollary . in our context , the natural combinatorial structure for creating many edges with a small number of edges is a  giant clique . \"",
    "the clique number , the ( typical ) size of the largest clique of the random geometric graph , falls under the general class scan statistics , has been shown to focus on two values with high probability for certain values of the threshold parameter @xmath9 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) ; however , these works do not explore the large deviation regime .",
    "our work uses techniques from large deviations , concentration inequalities , convex analysis , and geometric measure theory .",
    "a key component in the proof is a technique for proving localization that has previously appeared in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a poisson point process of intensity @xmath2 on the @xmath22-dimensional unit torus @xmath23^d$ ] .",
    "let @xmath24 . recall that @xmath25 is a poisson random variable with mean @xmath2 , and conditional on @xmath25 , @xmath1 is just a set of @xmath25 points chosen independently and uniformly at random .",
    "let @xmath3 be a positive sequence that decreases to @xmath26 as @xmath27 , and @xmath10 be some norm on @xmath12 that induces a translation - invariant metric on @xmath28 .",
    "we define the random geometric graph @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , enumerated arbitrarily , and @xmath31 is the set of unordered pairs @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "figure 1 shows a particular instance of @xmath34 .    letting @xmath35 be the indicator that there is an edge between @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ", we can calculate the expected value of @xmath4 , the number of edges in the graph : @xmath38\\\\ & = \\frac{n^2}{2 } \\mathbb{p}(\\|v_1-v_2\\|\\le r_n).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the symmetry of the torus , @xmath39 is simply @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the volume of the unit ball of the given norm , @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 for the rest of the article , we suppose the existence of a fixed constant @xmath43 such that , for all sufficiently large @xmath2 , @xmath44 the lower bound ensures that the expected number of edges is polynomially large in @xmath2 ; the upper bound excludes the possibility of @xmath3 vanishing as the inverse of a polynomial in @xmath45 ( for example ) , but is not much stronger than the initial requirement of @xmath3 vanishing in as @xmath2 grows .",
    "we define a parameter @xmath21 as @xmath46 implicitly assuming that the limit exists ; we will continue to assume this for the rest of the paper .",
    ", with respect to the euclidean norm .",
    "the graph has 148 vertices and 343 edges .",
    "the gray area is the white unit square translated , to show periodicity ]    this ensures that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 varies more slowly than any polynomial or rational function in @xmath2 .",
    "notice that @xmath21 depends only on the tail behavior of @xmath9 , and is completely independent of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath49 thanks to .",
    "the following theorem is the main result of the paper :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath50 be a random geometric graph model on the d - dimensional torus with respect to some norm @xmath10 and a threshold parameter that satisfies @xmath51 for some fixed @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 , where @xmath41 is the volume of the unit ball under the norm @xmath54 .",
    "( that is , @xmath55 is the volume of the ball of diameter @xmath3 . )",
    "fix @xmath6 and @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the event that the following happen : ( a ) there is a ball @xmath58 of diameter @xmath3 such that any convex set @xmath59 with @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 denotes lebesgue measure ) satisfies @xmath62 and ( b ) for any convex set @xmath63 with @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 lies in some ball of diameter @xmath3 , @xmath66 then the conditional probability of the event @xmath57 given that @xmath67 tends to @xmath68 as @xmath27 .",
    "the convexity requirement is probably not optimal , but forces the set @xmath65 to be sufficiently `` nice '' to preclude sets which are either sparse but of large measure ( such as generalized cantor sets ) or have boundaries that take up a large amount of space .",
    "we also force @xmath65 to be large to make sure it can not pick up the lower order uneveness in the conditional process . probing the poisson point process with such sets",
    "is sufficient to show that graph will appear uniform , up to sets of measure equal to arbitrarily small multiples of @xmath55 .    as a consequence of theorem [ thm1 ] , we prove that the upper tail of the edge count of random geometric graphs satisfies a large deviation principle . recall that @xmath69 satisfies an _ upper tail _ large deviation principle with speed @xmath70 and rate function @xmath71 if , for any closed set @xmath72 , @xmath73 and for any open set @xmath74 , @xmath75    [ thmldp ] let @xmath50 be a random geometric graph model on the d - dimensional torus , with the same assumptions as in theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "define @xmath76 where @xmath21 is defined as in .",
    "then the random variable @xmath69 satisfies an upper tail large deviation principle with speed @xmath77 and rate function  @xmath71 .    note",
    "that this rate function , like all other claims in this paper , is only valid for events in which the number of edges exceeds its mean .",
    "the lower tail of the edge count is likely to satisfy poisson - like statistics , and hence the speed of its large deviation probability is expected to be of order @xmath78 , not @xmath77 .",
    "before we go on , we d like to comment on the heuristic formulation we presented earlier .",
    "first , since the rate function of [ thmldp ] is strictly increasing , we know that , conditional on @xmath79 , the event @xmath80 occurs with high probability for any @xmath81 and @xmath2 sufficiently large . if we take @xmath82 in the first stipulation of [ thm1 ] , we see that the ball @xmath58 of diameter @xmath3 includes at least @xmath83 edges of the random geometric graph .",
    "since @xmath84 and @xmath85 are arbitrarily close to zero , we recover our original claim that ` almost all extra edges are between points in @xmath58 ' . in terms of the geometry ,",
    "we see that there are approximately @xmath86 vertices that are more or less equi - distributed inside @xmath58 . outside of this set , we would like to say that there are no other large cliques ; unfortunately , [ thm1 ] does not provide this result .",
    "instead , we can only be sure that every other clique outside of the  exceptional \" set @xmath58 has @xmath87 vertices .",
    "we conjecture that the size of the largest clique disjoint from @xmath58 is of the same order as the size of the largest clique of an _ unconditional _ random geometric graph with the same values of @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". a combination of this conjecture and elementary estimates on poisson point processes should be sufficient to establish a ( suitably formalized ) version of the claim ` the remaining portion of the graph remains unchanged . '",
    "henceforth in the manuscript , we will suppress the subscript @xmath2 and write @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath9 instead of @xmath1 , @xmath78 , @xmath55 and @xmath3 .",
    "we now present an approximation of the random geometric model which allows us to replace the poisson point process with a sequence of independent poisson random variables . to do this ,",
    "we first discretize space , and then produce a metric on the resulting `` cells '' that approximates the norm @xmath10 on the unit torus .",
    "we call this the @xmath88-graded model",
    ".    fix an integer @xmath88 , and define @xmath92 so that @xmath93 let @xmath94 .",

    "note that @xmath88 is exactly the minimal number of cells that must be traversed in any one axial direction to ensure that we exceed the distance @xmath9 .",
    "this parameter takes the place of @xmath9 in the @xmath88-graded model .",
    "we now define a metric on @xmath14 , induced by the norm on torus : @xmath105 where the circles indicate the interiors of the sets .",
    "note that the distance is always an integer .",
    "moreover , @xmath106 if @xmath107 is the smallest integer such that some point in @xmath108 and some point in @xmath109 are less than @xmath107 away , measured in units of @xmath110 , the side length of the cubes .",
    "we force the points to be in the interior to prevent `` trivialities '' , such as two adjacent cells being distance @xmath26 , since they share a boundary .",
    "we are now ready to define the @xmath88-graded random geometric graph .",
    "let @xmath111 have the same vertex set as the original graph . for each vertex @xmath112 ,",
    "let @xmath113 be the index in @xmath14 such that @xmath114 ; there is ambiguity on the boundary of the @xmath97 s , but that set has lebesgue measure 0 , and therefore it has no vertices of @xmath89 , almost surely .",
    "we say @xmath115 whenever @xmath116 .",
    "essentially , the @xmath88-graded model allows every point to wander inside a cubical `` cage '' of side - length @xmath110 , and connects any two points that might be connected after we allow this mobility . in this framework , it is clear that @xmath117 becomes smaller as @xmath88 decreases .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently large @xmath88 , @xmath117 is identical to @xmath31 ; unfortunately , this @xmath88 will depend on @xmath2 . due to uniformity issues",
    ", we will instead fix @xmath88 and later show that , even when @xmath88 is finite but large , the approximation is good .",
    "the major benefit of the @xmath88-graded model is that its edge count is very simple to express in terms of @xmath118 , the number of points in each @xmath97 : @xmath119.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this random variable is defined in terms of i.i.d .",
    "random variables , which eases the analysis greatly .",
    "furthermore , the ambient geometry of the torus is encoded completely by the metric @xmath22 .",
    "finally , each @xmath118 only appears in finitely many terms in this expression .",
    "the  finite range \" nature of the representation will play a major role in the proof presented .",
    "we quantify this fact as follows : for any @xmath120 , let @xmath121 .",
    "thanks to translation invariance of @xmath22 , the cardinality of this set is independent of the choice of @xmath122 . using this parameter , we can compute the expected number of edges in the @xmath88-graded random geometric graph easily : @xmath123 + \\frac{1}{2 }   \\sum_{j\\ , : \\",

    "we define @xmath126 i.e. @xmath127 is the cardinality of a maximal clique set .",
    "we can now state the equivalent to theorem [ thm1 ] for the @xmath88-graded model :    [ thm2 ] fix an integer @xmath88 and let @xmath128 be an @xmath88-graded random geometric graph , with @xmath129 for some fixed @xmath130 .",

    "this creates all the ` extra edges ' in the graph . as in theorem",
    "[ thm1 ] , this set will contain almost all the edges not expected to be the in unconditional @xmath88-graded model , and the rest of graph will look unaltered , at least in the scale of @xmath141",
    ". this theorem will also be instrumental in proving [ thmldp ] ; that proof will appear in section 7 .",
    "before embarking on a proper proof , we sketch the main ideas required . the first step is to show that the @xmath88-graded model is , in fact , a good approximation for the random geometric graph .",
    "to do so , we first show that we can approximate any convex subset @xmath65 of a ball of diameter @xmath9 from both the inside and the outside by a union of @xmath97 s .",
    "next , we use the classical isodiametric inequality to show that the @xmath97 s associated with a maximal clique set approximate a ball of diameter @xmath9 , in the sense of the hausdorff metric .",
    "armed with these facts , showing that theorem [ thm2 ] implies theorem [ thm1 ] is a matter of careful `` epsilontics . ''",
    "we then turn to directly analyzing the @xmath88-graded model , conditioned on the event @xmath142 for notational convenience , let @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "define @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a small positive number .",
    "this is the set of `` large '' indices , in the sense that their associated @xmath118 s exceed their expected value by a fixed polynomial factor in @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath147 and @xmath148 the former quantity is an appropriately chosen convex function of the @xmath118 s , while the latter is a scaled version of the number of edges with both endpoints in the @xmath97 s associated with @xmath149 .",
