    "during the last decades , astrophysicists and astronomers have made remarkable predictions about the gap of more than @xmath0 percent of the overall energy density in the universe .",
    "based on recent observations @xcite , it has been made consensus that dark energy ( de ) fills this gap .",
    "it is the unknown force having large negative pressure and referred to be responsible for accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "many efforts have been made about its identity but its nature is still unknown .",
    "the most obvious candidate of de is the cosmological constant ( or vacuum energy ) but it suffers two major problems @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting as well as the most challenging problem to find the best fit model of de .",
    "there are different dynamical de models out of which holographic dark energy ( hde ) model is the most prominent .",
    "it is proposed in the scenario of quantum gravity on the basis of holographic principle @xcite .",
    "in fact , the derivation of this model is based on the argument @xcite that _ the vacuum energy ( or the quantum zero - point energy ) of a system with size @xmath1 should always remain less than the mass of a black hole with the same size due to the formation of black hole in quantum field theory_. in mathematical form , we have @xmath2 , known as hde density @xcite . here the constant @xmath3 is used for convenience , @xmath1 represents the infrared ( ir ) cutoff and @xmath4 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the choice of ir cutoff in the hde model is very crucial .",
    "li @xcite remarked that instead of hubble or particle horizons , the future event horizon should be the ir cutoff which shows compatibility with the present evolution of the universe .",
    "later on , it was pointed out @xcite that this choice of ir cutoff suffers the causality problem and proposed the age of the universe as ir cutoff , called agegraphic de model .",
    "some other proposals have also been given for the choice of ir cutoff .",
    "granda and oliveros @xcite proposed that ir cutoff should be the function of square of the hubble parameter and its derivative .",
    "this type of ir cutoff is motivated from the ricci scalar of the frw universe @xcite .",
    "the scalar field de models also belong to the family of dynamical de models which explain the de phenomenon .",
    "a wide variety of these models exists in literature including quintessence , k - essence , tachyon , phantom , ghost condensates and dilaton @xcite . also , the well - known theories such as the supersymmetric , string and m theories can not describe potential of the scalar field independently",
    ". it would be interesting to reconstruct the potential of de models so that the scalar fields may describe the cosmological behavior of the quantum gravity .",
    "the modification in the gravitational part and enhancement of dimensions in the original general relativity is another way to handle the de puzzle . in higher dimensional theories , kaluza - klein ( kk )",
    "theory @xcite has been used extensively for the purpose of cosmological implications .",
    "this theory has been described into ways , i.e. , compact and non - compact forms depending on its fifth dimension . in its compact form ,",
    "fifth dimension is like a circle having very small radius while in non - compact form , it behaves as a vacuum of 4d geometry .",
    "moreover , the hde has also been derived in higher dimensions with the help of the @xmath5-dimensional mass of the schwarzschild black hole @xcite known as modified holographic dark energy ( mhde ) model @xcite .",
    "sharif et al .",
    "@xcite-@xcite have investigated the evolution as well as generalized second law of thermodynamics of mhde with hubble and future event horizons as ir cutoffs in the flat and non - flat kk universe models . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the scalar field models are constructed for hde with hubble horizon and granda and oliveros cutoff as ir cutoff in flat and non - flat universes .",
    "here we use the granda and oliveros @xcite ir cutoff for mhde in flat kk universe .",
    "we discuss the evolution , instability and scalar field de models in this scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section * 2 * contains discussion of the evolution and instability of mhde in flat kk universe . in section * 3 * , we reconstruct scalar field models of mhde .",
    "the last section summarizes the results .",
    "in this section , we make analysis of the equation of state ( eos ) parameter and instability of mhde in compact flat kk universe @xcite whose metric is given by @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 indicates the cosmic scale factor .",
    "the corresponding field equations are @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter , dot indicates differentiation with respect to time and @xmath10 for the sake of simplicity . also , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pressure and energy density due to de respectively . in order to derive mhde",
    ", we use the formula of the mass of the schwarzschild black hole in @xmath5 dimensions @xmath13 where @xmath14 is planck mass in higher dimensions , @xmath15 is the area of @xmath5 unit spheres and @xmath16 represents the size of the black hole . for kk universe , we take @xmath17 and use the formula of area , it follows that @xmath18 here , we assume @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are positive constants , this ir cutoff is proposed by granda and oliveros @xcite ) and @xmath22 should be less than the planck length . this shows that horizon scale does not make the mass of five dimensional black hole larger than compactification scale of kk universe ( i.e. , of the order of planck length ) , while it reduces its mass . with the help of cohen et al .",
    "@xcite relation , we can derive mhde in the following form @xcite @xmath23 here we take @xmath22 to be unity .    the equation of continuity for the mhde become @xmath24 equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) lead to @xmath25 where @xmath26 . solving the above equation",
    ", we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an integration constant .",
    "the eos parameter for mhde can be obtained by using eqs.([4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) @xmath29    we plot @xmath30 versus redshift parameter @xmath31 by using @xmath32 as shown in figure @xmath33 by taking @xmath34 and different values of @xmath35 .",
    "it is observed that the eos parameter evolutes the universe from quintessence de era towards vacuum de era .",
    "this also shows that the parameter @xmath30 always remains in the quintessence region for @xmath36 .",
    "however , it corresponds to the early inflation era for @xmath37 in the early time .",
    "now we explore the linear perturbation in order to examine the instability of mhde . for this purpose ,",
    "the square of the speed of sound ( @xmath38 ) is evaluated which characterizes the stability of de models .",
    "the speed of sound has the form @xcite @xmath39 where prime shows differentiation with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "we would like to mention here that de models are classically unstable as @xmath41 and vice versa .",
    "equations ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) yield @xmath42 we plot the speed of sound versus @xmath31 as shown in figure * 2 * by keeping the same values of constant parameters as given above .",
    "this shows that the mhde remains unstable in the early epoch and stable for the present and later time .",
    "the current prediction of accelerated expansion of the universe has roots in the early inflationary epoch .",
    "it is argued that the inflation field has similar properties as the cosmological constant .",
    "moreover , inspired by the inflation field , scalar field models have been proposed .",
    "scalar field models are used in explaining the de phenomenon due to their dynamical nature .",
    "these models describe the quintessence behavior of the universe and also provide the effective description of de models through reconstruction scenario . in our case ,",
    "the eos for mhde obeys this argument and hence it would be interesting to reconstruct the scalar field de models in this scenario .",
    "we discuss all the results graphically with the same values of the constant parameters as given in the previous section .",
    "this model is originated in the light of scalar field @xmath43 which is minimally coupled with gravity .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the quintessence de model are given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the kinetic energy and @xmath46 is the potential of scalar field .",
    "this equation gives the eos parameter as @xmath47 we identify @xmath48 and @xmath49 to establish the correspondence between mhde and quintessence scalar field .",
    "thus , it follows from eq.([11 ] ) that @xmath50 the value of scalar field turns out to be @xmath51 the evolutionary trajectories of the scalar field @xmath43 and the corresponding scalar potential are shown in figures * 3 * and * 4*. here we use the initial condition of the scalar field @xmath52 .",
    "we notice that the quintessence field increases initially but becomes flat at high redshift .",
    "this shows that the field decreases gradually with the expansion of the universe . also , we observe that the quintessence potential becomes more steeper with the decrease of @xmath21 and tends to flat in the later epoch",
    ".      the energy and pressure of the tachyon de model has the form @xcite @xmath53 the corresponding eos parameter is @xmath54 the correspondence between mhde and tachyon model is obtained for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which leads to @xmath57 equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) give @xmath58 we solve and plot it against @xmath31 as shown in figure @xmath59 .",
    "the evolution of tachyon field is very much similar to the quintessence field .",
    "the tachyon field attains the maximum value at early epoch and then decreases and goes towards zero at the present epoch . also , we remark that the tachyon field rolls down potential slowly with the expansion of the universe as shown in figure * 6*.      the energy density and pressure of this model are @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath46 represents the scalar potential of k - essence model .",
    "this leads to the following eos parameter for tachyon de model @xmath62    we set @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the correspondence between mhde and k - essence model and obtain @xmath65    finally , the expression @xmath66 leads to @xmath67 figure @xmath68 shows that the k - essence scalar field decreases with the increment of mhde parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the eos of tachyon de model is compatible with the accelerated expansion of the universe in the range @xmath69 .",
    "it is noted that the kinetic term is consistent with this eos for @xmath70 , but it is inconsistent for @xmath71 as shown in figure @xmath72 .",
    "also , the plot @xmath73 indicates that the k - essence potential increases with the increase of the field @xmath43 .",
    "it rolls down the potential because k - essence scalar field decreases with the expansion of the universe .",
    "the lagrangian of dilaton field describes the pressure of scalar field given by @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are taken as positive constants .",
    "the corresponding energy density is @xmath77 this model has the eos parameter @xmath78 the replacement of @xmath79 by @xmath12 and @xmath80 by @xmath11 ( for correspondence ) gives @xmath81 its plot against @xmath31 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 is shown in figure * 10*. we observe that @xmath84 shows consistency with the expanding scenario of the universe predicated by eos of this model .",
    "the solution of the above equation follows @xmath85.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] its graphical presentation is shown in figure * 11 * which exhibits direct proportionality with respect to @xmath31 leading to the scaling solutions for dilaton model @xcite .",
    "it is believed that our universe expands with accelerated expansion and the scalar field de models act as an effective theories of an underlying phenomenon of de .",
    "we investigate the evolution of mhde , instability and reconstructed scalar field de models .",
    "we consider mhde with ir cutoff as a function of the hubble parameter and its derivative in the flat kaluza - klein universe .",
    "this type of de density avoids the causality problem due to dependence on the local quantities .",
    "the mhde parameter @xmath21 plays the crucial role in evaluating the results .",
    "we have used the best fit values of @xmath86 and @xmath35 obtained by wang and xu @xcite through type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , cmbr and the observational hubble data .",
    "the results are summarized as follows .    *",
    "the eos parameter @xmath30 shows transition from quintessence de era ( @xmath87 ) towards vacuum de era ( @xmath88 ) as displayed in figure @xmath33 .",
    "this type of behavior has led to reconstruct the scalar field de models . also , our result of the present value of @xmath89 at @xmath90 ( for @xmath35 ) is almost closer to the value obtained for hde in gr @xcite . *",
    "it is interesting to check the viability of the mhde model due to its dependence upon local quantities . using the squared speed of sound",
    ", we have found that the mhde with new ir cutoff is unstable for early epoch but stable for the later time as shown in figure @xmath91 .",
    "it is mentioned here that the mhde is always stable for @xmath92 , while in gr , the new hde is unstable @xcite .",
    "in addition , the chaplygin and tachyon chaplygin gases are stable as @xmath93 , but the holographic @xcite , agegraphic @xcite and qcd ghost de @xcite models are classically unstable as @xmath41 . * finally , we have provided the correspondence of mhde with scalar field de models including quintessence , tachyon , k - essence and dilaton models . in all these models ,",
    "the scalar field shows the decreasing behavior with the expansion of the universe .",
    "the scalar potential increases and becomes steeper with the increase of scalar field @xmath43 for quintessence , tachyon and k - essence de models .",
    "the plots of scalar field de models are given in figures * * 3**@xmath94 * 11*. in k - essence and dilaton de models , the kinetic terms exactly lie in the required region ( where eos parameter predicts the accelerated expansion of the universe ) .",
    "we would like to remark here that the results of scalar field and corresponding potential are consistent with the current status of the universe .",
    "these are also consistent with the results of zhang @xcite for quintessence hde , for tachyon hde @xcite and rozas - fern@xmath95ndez @xcite for dilaton hde models ."
