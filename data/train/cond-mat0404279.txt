    "the appearance of exotic quantum phases in systems described by two - dimensional frustrated antiferromagnets is presently the subject of intense research ( see e.g.  refs .   for recent reviews ) .",
    "the heisenberg antiferromagnet on highly frustrated lattices such as the pyrochlore and kagom lattice has a huge degeneracy of the classical ground state such that no magnetic order arises at any temperature ( see e.g.  ref .   for a recent review ) . at the quantum level",
    "one may then obtain different exotic phases without magnetic ( nel ) order .",
    "one such phase is the so - called ` valence - bond crystal ' which is characterized by formation of local singlets in a long - range ordered pattern .",
    "an even more exotic phase , namely one without any kind of long - range order , is suspected to arise in the @xmath1 heisenberg model on the kagom lattice.@xcite in the latter case , there is a small spin gap and , although this is still under discussion,@xcite the ground state is suspected to be disordered .",
    "in particular , a huge number of singlets ( exponentially growing with the system size ) is found inside the spin gap which are reminiscent of the classical degeneracy .",
    "the spin @xmath1 kagom heisenberg antiferromagnet ( khafm ) is realized e.g.  in volborthite,@xcite although presumably in some distorted form .",
    "another possible realization is given by atomic quantum gases in optical lattices.@xcite in the latter case , magnetization corresponds to particle number and a magnetic field to chemical potential , opening the possibility to perform experiments for the behavior of the spin model in a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetization process of the khafm has been studied theoretically both for classical @xcite as well as quantum spins.@xcite numerical results for the magnetization curve of the @xmath1 heisenberg model exhibit among others a clear plateau at @xmath0 of the saturation magnetization @xcite ( see also fig.[figkagm1o3 ] ) . for the classical khafm at one third of the saturation field thermal fluctuations select collinear states , but there appears to be no real order.@xcite for the @xmath1 khafm we will argue in this paper that the state with magnetization @xmath2 exhibits order of the valence - bond crystal type ( the spin - spin correlation functions are short - ranged@xcite ) although it shares some similarities with the case @xmath3 .    in the present paper we study the @xmath4 model in a magnetic field @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 indicates nearest neighbors on the kagom lattice ( see inset of fig .  [ figkagm1o3 ] ) , @xmath8 are spin - half operators acting at site @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the @xmath4-anisotropy .",
    "first we present numerical results which have been obtained by lanczos diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hxxz ] ) using the program package spinpack.@xcite all numerical computations have been performed on lattices with @xmath11 sites subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ figkagm1o3 ] shows the boundaries of the fully polarized state ( which we normalize to @xmath12 ) and a state with @xmath13 in the @xmath4 model ( [ hxxz ] ) .",
    "[ figll36](a ) shows the low - lying excitations above the @xmath14 ground state computed by exact diagonalization for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the dashed lines show the gap to states with @xmath17 and @xmath18 which vanishes at the boundaries of the plateau .",
    "the maximum magnetic gap occurs in the middle of the plateau where these two lines intersect and we will use this as a definition of the magnetic gap .",
    "horizontal straight lines denote states with @xmath19 ( _ i.e._@xmath14 ) and correspond to non - magnetic excitations .",
    "the large number of non - magnetic excitations below the magnetic gap is reminiscent of the classical degeneracy .",
    "the shape of the integrated density of non - magnetic excitations ( see fig .  [ figll36](b ) ) is very similar to the corresponding integrated density of singlets at @xmath20 ( see fig .  2 of ref .  ) . in combination with the disordered classical ground state,@xcite one",
    "might be tempted to take this as evidence that also the ground state of the @xmath1 khafm at @xmath21 is disordered .",
    "however , we will argue next that here classical and quantum fluctuations are in fact not equivalent at the harmonic level and then present evidence in favor of an _ ordered _ state for @xmath1 .",
    "classical ( thermal ) fluctuations were studied in refs . such that we make only a few comments valid for non - zero magnetization and arbitrary anisotropy @xmath10 . as was shown explicitly for @xmath16 in ref .",
    ", thermal fluctuations select collinear ` up - up - down ' ( uud ) configurations at @xmath2 against the other non - collinear configurations that also minimize the classical energy , but all uud configurations have the same spectra of harmonic fluctuations .",
    "indeed , a local change of variables shows that the covering - dependent hamiltonians of classical gaussian fluctuations @xcite are equivalent .",
    "the role of quantum fluctuations is however radically different .",
    "now quantum commutation relations have to be preserved and the change of variables used for the classical case is no longer possible . to analyze this in more detail",
    ", we compute the zero - point contribution to the ground state energy at @xmath21 for two different coverings with a @xmath22 and a @xmath23 structure , respectively ( the latter can be found e.g.  in fig .  1 of ref .  ) . by writing the spin operators on each site in terms of bosonic creation and annihilation operators :",
    "s_l = s ( ( a^_l+a_l ) , i ( a^_l - a_l),1- ) , [ hp ] we obtain the hamiltonian :",
    "h = h_0 + ( h_2 + o ( 1/ ) ) , where @xmath24 is quadratic in creation and annihilation operators and the @xmath25 part contains higher orders . by fourier transforming , we obtain : h_2= _ ( a_-^i , a_^i ) (    cc ^+ & ^- + ^- & ^+    ) _ ij (    c a_-^j + a_^j    )  , [ hqtransf ] where @xmath26 are @xmath27 and @xmath28 matrices for the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 states since these coverings have @xmath29 and @xmath30 sublattices , respectively .",
    "no further change of variables is possible here since the commutation relations of the @xmath31 algebra of the spins have to be preserved . at @xmath16 one",
    "finds for the zero - point fluctuations @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 state , respectively , demonstrating the inequivalence of the different coverings at the quantum level .",
    "let us now return to the extreme quantum case @xmath1 and study the anisotropic @xmath4 limit . for @xmath34 , we can adapt the analysis of refs .   of the ising model in a transverse field to the @xmath4 model by replacing the expansion in the transverse field with an expansion in powers of @xmath35 .    in the ising limit @xmath36 , the ground states are those states where around each triangle two spins point up and one down .",
    "this ground - state space of the ising model can then be taken as configuration space for a perturbative treatment of the @xmath37-part of the @xmath4 hamiltonian , for sufficiently large lattices , the lowest non - trivial order is third order , flipping simultaneously pairwise antiparallel spins around a hexagon .",
    "this is described by an effective hamiltonian @xcite h_eff .",
    "= _ hexagon  i ( s^+_i,1 s^-_i,2 s^+_i,3 s^-_i,4 s^+_i,5 s^-_i,6",
    "s^-_i,1 s^+_i,2 s^-_i,3 s^+_i,4 s^-_i,5 s^+_i,6 ) , [ heff ] where the spin operator @xmath38 operates at the @xmath39th site around hexagon @xmath9 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that in the ising - basis the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) has only off - diagonal matrix elements of size @xmath41 .",
    "the configurations of the ising model can be mapped to dimer coverings of the dual lattice which in the case of the kagom lattice is the hexagonal lattice .",
    "now one can use known results for dimer coverings @xcite to write down the asymptotic growth law for the number of ising configurations @xmath42 on an @xmath11-site kagom lattice : @xmath43    exploiting results for the related quantum dimer model on the hexagonal lattice,@xcite moessner and sondhi concluded @xcite that the ground state of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) is of the valence - bond crystal type . to be more precise , the case studied in refs .",
    "corresponds to @xmath44 whereas we have @xmath45 , but there exist unitary transformations which change the sign of @xmath41.@xcite hence the spectra of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) are invariant under @xmath46 .",
    "the three - fold degenerate ground - state wave functions are sketched in the inset of fig .  [ figkagm1o3 ] . circles in one third of the hexagons denote resonances between the two different nel states on the surrounding hexagon ; a background of the remaining third of all spins points in the direction of the field .",
    "note that these wave functions were argued in @xcite to yield a qualitatively correct description , but they should not be used for a quantitative analysis .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that due to the resonances , these wave functions are of a purely quantum nature and have no counterparts as unique states of the classical heisenberg model .    according to the above , at large @xmath10 the @xmath47 state of the @xmath4 model on the kagom lattice should be _",
    "three_-fold degenerate with a _ gap _ to the next non - magnetic excitations . to check this conclusion and compare it to fig .",
    "[ figll36 ] , let us look at the spectrum of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "this effective model has a substantially reduced hilbert space ( e.g.  for @xmath15 there are only 120 states ) .",
    "we can therefore go to larger lattice sizes than in the full model .",
    "results for kagom lattices with up to @xmath48 sites are shown in fig .",
    "additional short cycles wrap around the boundaries of the lattice for @xmath49 and lead to non - generic ground states of @xmath50 .",
    "accordingly , systems with @xmath51 should not be considered and are not included in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "two features are apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] at least for the two biggest system sizes ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "firstly , there are two further levels above the ground state .",
    "the finite - size dependence of the second excited state is shown by @xmath54 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and indicates that it is converging to @xmath55 which is consistent with the expected three - fold degeneracy of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "secondly , there is a huge density of states emerging for @xmath56 .",
    "the finite - size behavior of the @xmath57 level in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicates that a gap of the order @xmath58 to these higher excited states persists in the thermodynamic limit . for @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "there are two further levels in between .",
    "it is difficult to extrapolate their energies to @xmath59 , but the behavior of the @xmath60 excited level in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] at the largest values of @xmath11 suggests that they retain a finite gap in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "inspection of the wave - functions indicates that these additional low - lying levels may arise from the three classical @xmath61 configurations .",
    "although the effective hamiltonian leads to higher degeneracies of some excited states , the @xmath15 curves in figs .",
    "[ figll36 ] and [ fig2 ] have a very similar shape which can be taken as a first indication that the same scenario as for @xmath34 also applies to @xmath16 .",
    "comparison of the overall scales leads to an estimate for the gap in the @xmath21 sector at @xmath16 of about @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the total number of ising configurations is very close to the number of non - magnetic excitations below the magnetic gap for @xmath16 at a given system size ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "hence , the growth law ( [ nconf ] ) yields a good approximation also to the number of non - magnetic excitations in the heisenberg model ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is instructive to compute the overlap of the wave function of the full @xmath4 model , @xmath64 , with the ground state wave function , @xmath65 , of the effective hamiltonian with the same number of spins @xmath11 .",
    "the analysis of the effective hamiltonian implies that one should study only sizes which are multiples of 9 and that @xmath15 is the smallest which is representative of the general case .",
    "however , @xmath15 is the biggest system where we have been able to study the full @xmath4 model and hence the only case we can discuss .",
    "results for the overlap @xmath66 are shown by the full line in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . we observe that this overlap tends to 1 for large values of @xmath10 , as expected .",
    "furthermore , the overlap remains appreciable even close to the heisenberg model ( @xmath67 for @xmath16 ) , in particular if one considers that the dimension of the symmetry subspace under consideration is of the order @xmath68 .",
    "note further that an analogous computation of the overlap of the ground state of the ising and the full @xmath4 model at @xmath21 on the triangular lattice leads to a sharp drop at @xmath69 for a fixed @xmath11 ( see dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath15 ) , signaling an instability of the plateau state.@xcite no such sharp drop is observed on the kagom lattice ( full line in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) which we take as a sign of absence of phase transitions between @xmath36 and @xmath70 in the @xmath4 model on the kagom lattice at @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , @xmath16 and @xmath72 should belong to the same phase .",
    "to conclude , we have analyzed the low - energy spectrum of the kagom @xmath4 @xmath1 model at magnetization @xmath2 . while the existence of a magnetization plateau is clear , the nature of the non - magnetic excitations over the ground state is more difficult to clarify .",
    "we have argued by different techniques that the ground state has an order of the valence - bond crystal type , _",
    "i.e. _  the ground state is three - fold degenerate and there is a small gap to all higher excitations .",
    "while in the case @xmath34 this scenario is derived from a mapping to an effective hamiltonian,@xcite our numerical data indicates that it persists down to the isotropic limit @xmath16 .",
    "one of the key differences between the present case and @xmath73 lies in the unrenormalized classical thermal and quantum fluctuations . in the absence of a magnetic field , they are equivalent regarding the lifting of degeneracy of configurations with soft modes ( planar configurations ) . however , for @xmath74 , classical thermal fluctuations select the collinear uud configurations and the weight in the free energy of any uud covering is equivalent at the harmonic level . because of commutation relations that have to be preserved at the quantum level , the zero - point corrections over the uud configurations are not any more equal .",
    "this is the first indication that a spin liquid phase is less likely to appear than for the @xmath3 case .    for @xmath1 and @xmath16",
    "we find , for @xmath21 , an exponential number of non - magnetic excitations below the magnetic gap which are reminiscent of the classical degeneracy ; just as for @xmath20.@xcite in the latter case the macroscopic number of non - magnetic excitations has been taken as evidence for a completely disordered ground state . here , however , we find evidence for a further small gap , separating the continuum of states from a ground state , which has long - range order of valence - bond crystal type .",
    "we remark that the @xmath15 spectrum @xcite suggests that candidates for valence - bond ordered states for @xmath20 would have a larger unit cell than the state above .",
    "hence , we believe that the issue of order at very low energies in the @xmath1 khafm at @xmath20 remains a challenging problem .",
