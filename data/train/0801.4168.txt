    "the concept of gpds  @xcite has led to completely new methods of `` spatial imaging '' of the nucleon .",
    "the mapping of the nucleon gpds , and a detailed understanding of the spatial quark distribution of the nucleon , have been widely recognized are a key objectives of nuclear physics of the next decade , and is a key justification for the jlab energy upgrade to 12 gev .",
    "gpds also allow to quantify how the orbital motion of quarks in the nucleon contributes to the nucleon spin ",
    "a question of crucial importance for our understanding of the `` mechanics '' underlying nucleon structure .",
    "this requires a comprehensive program , combining results of measurements of a variety of processes in electron ",
    "nucleon scattering with structural information obtained from theoretical studies , as well as with expected results from future lattice qcd simulations .",
    "it is well recognized  @xcite that exclusive processes can be used to probe the gpds and construct 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images of the quark content of the nucleon . deeply virtual compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production are identified as the processes most suitable to map out the twist-2 vector gpds @xmath1 and the axial gpds @xmath2 in @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the momentum fraction of the struck quark , @xmath5 the longitudinal momentum transfer to the quark , and @xmath6 the momentum transfer to the nucleon . having access to a 3-dimensional image of the nucleon ( two dimensions in transverse space , one dimension in longitudinal momentum ) opens up completely new insights into the complex structure of the nucleon .",
    "for example , the nucleon matrix element of the energy - momentum tensor contains 3 form factors that encode information on the angular momentum distribution @xmath7 of the quarks with flavor @xmath8 in transverse space , their mass - energy distribution @xmath9 , and their pressure and force distribution @xmath10 .",
    "these form factors also appear as moments of the vector gpds  @xcite , thus offering prospects of accessing these quantities through detailed mapping of gpds .",
    "the quark angular momentum in the nucleon is given by @xmath11~,\\ ] ] and the mass - energy and pressure distribution @xmath12 the mass - energy and force - pressure distribution of the quarks are given by the second moment of gpd @xmath13 , and their relative contribution is controlled by @xmath5 .",
    "the separation of @xmath14 and @xmath10 requires measurement of these moments in a large range of @xmath5 .",
    "dvcs has been shown  @xcite to be the cleanest process to access gpds at the kinematics accessible today .",
    "it is also a relatively rare process and requires high luminosities for the required high statistics measurements .",
    "the beam helicity - dependent cross section asymmetry is given in leading twist as @xmath15d\\phi~,\\]]where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the dirac and pauli form factors , @xmath18 is the azimuthal angle between the electron scattering plane and the hadronic plane . the kinematically suppressed term with gpd @xmath19 is omitted .",
    "for not too large @xmath5 the asymmetry is mostly sensitive to the gpd @xmath20 .",
    "the asymmmetry with a longitudinally polarized target is given by @xmath21~.\\ ] ] the combination of @xmath22 and @xmath23 allows a separation of gpd @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "using a transversely polarized target the asymmetry @xmath25\\ ] ] can be measured , which depends in leading order on gpd @xmath19 and is highly sensitive to orbital angular momentum contributions of quarks .    clearly , determining moments of gpds for different @xmath6 will require measurement in a large range of @xmath4 , in particular at large @xmath4 .",
    "the reconstruction of the transverse spatial quark distribution requires measurement in a large range in @xmath6 , and the separation of the @xmath10 and @xmath14 form factors requires a large span in @xmath5 .",
    "to meet the requirements of high statistics measurements of relatively rare exclusive processes such as dvcs at high photon virtuality @xmath26 , large @xmath6 and @xmath5 , the clas detector will be upgraded and modified to clas12  @xcite .",
    "the main new features of clas12 over the current clas detector include a high operational luminosity of @xmath27@xmath28sec@xmath29 , an order of magnitude increase over clas  @xcite .",
    "improved particle identification will be achieved with additional threshold gas cerenkov counter , improved timing resolution of the forward time - of - flight system , and a finer granularity electromagnetic preshower calorimeter that , in conjunction with th existing clas calorimeter will provide much improved @xmath30 separation for momenta up to 10 gev .",
    "in addition , a new central detector will be built that uses a high - field solenoid magnet for particle tracking and allows the operation of dynamically polarized solid state targets . with these upgrades clas12",
    "will be the workhorse for exclusive electroproduction experiments in the deep inelastic kinematics .",
    "the 12 gev upgrade offers much improved capabilities to access gpds .",
    "figure  [ fig : dvcs_alu_12gev ] shows the expected statistical precision of the beam dvcs asymmetry for some sample kinematics . at the expected luminosity of @xmath27@xmath28sec@xmath29 and for a run time of 2000 hours ,",
    "high statistics measurements in a very large kinematics range are possible .    using a dynamically polarized @xmath31 target we can also measure the longitudinal target spin asymmetry @xmath23 with high precision .",
    "the projected results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aul ] .",
    "the statistical accuracy of this measurement will be less than for the @xmath22 asymmetry due to the large dilution factor in the target material , but it will still be a very significant measurement .",
    "polarizing the target transverse to the beam direction will access a different combination of gpds , and provide different sensitivity for the y- and x - components of the target polarization . the expected accuracy for one of the polarization projections is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dvcs_aut_12gev ] . here",
    "the target is assumed to be a frozen hd - ice target , which has different characteristics from the @xmath31 target .",
    "a measurement of all 3 asymmetries will allow a separate determination of gpds @xmath32 and @xmath19 at the above specified kinematics . through a fourier transformation",
    "the t - dependence of gpd @xmath33 can be used to determine the @xmath34quark distribution in transverse impact parameter space .",
    "figure  [ fig : gpd_h ] shows projected results for such a transformation assuming a model parameterization for the kinematical dependences of gpd @xmath33 .",
    "knowledge of gpd @xmath19 will be particularly interesting as it is directly related to the orbital angular momentum distribution of quarks in transverse space .",
    "we thank the members of the clas collaboration who contributed to the development of the exciting physics program for the jlab upgrade to 12 gev , and the clas12 detector .",
