    "is the asymmetric phonon transmission through a nonlinear interface layer between two very dissimilar crystals @xcite . in the realm of acoustics the possibility of realizing a wave diode has been demonstrated for nonlinear phononic media @xcite .",
    "another promising context is the propagation of acoustic pulses through granular systems . in the latter context",
    ", experimental studies have demonstrated a change of the reflectivity of solitary waves from the interface between two granular media @xcite .",
    "more recently , demonstration of rectification of the mechanical - energy transfer at sonic frequencies in a one - dimensional array of particles has been reported too @xcite . in the field of nonlinear optics ,",
    "the so - called all - optical diode was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later on realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "other diverse implementations of the unidirectional transmission have been suggested , ranging from left - handed materials @xcite , periodic @xcite and quasiperiodic biancalana08 photonic crystals , coupled nonlinear cavities grigoriev2011 to @xmath0symmetric waveguides ramezani2010,dambroise2012 .",
    "an extension to quantum regimes , in which few - photon states may also display a diode effect , has been proposed in ref .",
    "a related work for electric transmission lines was reported in ref .",
    "interestingly , for nonlinear lattices brought in contact with thermal baths reciprocity violations are related to the second principle of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , a critical discussion of the topic , including the case of thermal sources , was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a reference model to discuss this type of phenomena is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite with embedded nonlinear elements molina1993,gupta1997,gupta1997a , bulgakov2011,brazhnyi2011 . beyond its relevance in various physical contexts , ranging from nonlinear optics to the physics of trapped cold gases",
    "@xcite , the dnls equation has the major advantage of being one of simplest dynamical systems amenable to a complete theoretical analysis . in the present context ,",
    "dnls - based models are particularly relevant , as they allow one to solve the scattering problem exactly , without complications of dealing with wave harmonics @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effect of the nonlinear shift of a resonance can be exploited to design a _ diode chain _ , capable to transmit waves with the same amplitude and frequency differently in opposite directions .    the propagation direction admitted by a diode chain",
    "is reversed in a chain which is a specular counterpart of the given one .",
    "this obvious fact suggests us to consider the transmission of waves in double chains , formed by two parallel diode cores with _ opposite orientations _ , which are linearly coupled to each other in the transverse direction .",
    "this setting , which may be called a _ diode - antidiode pair _",
    "( alias a _ diode dipole _ ) , is the subject of the present work .",
    "the transmission of waves in either direction in such a system obviously implies a spontaneous breaking of the antisymmetry between the transversely coupled counter - oriented cores .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a system of linearly coupled identical one - dimensional lattices with the onsite cubic nonlinearity , which admit the transmission of waves in both directions , was studied in ref .",
    "that system was modeled by two linearly coupled dnls equations , and the symmetry breaking was considered for quiescent discrete solitons .",
    "the spontaneous ( anti)symmetry - breaking effect , addressed in the present work , is completely different , being dynamical , rather than static , and realized in terms of incident , transmitted , and reflected linear waves , rather than solitons . in this respect",
    ", this is a new setting for the study of spontaneous - symmetry - breaking effects , which manifest themselves in a great variety of nonlinear systems malomed2013 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "two different models of the diode - antidiode pair are formulated in section [ sec : mod ] . in section sec : sim we describe simulations of the wave - packet scattering . in section [ sec : break ]",
    "we reports results for various dynamical regimes , focusing on the spontaneous symmetry breaking and restoration for the two different types of the coupled diode - antidiode system .",
