    "we study two examples of singular diffusion equations .",
    "one of them is an anisotropic total variation ( tv ) flow , the other one is the same equation with the additive isotropic linear diffusion , @xmath0 @xmath1 these problems are considered on a domain in @xmath2 . our goal is to study features of solutions like facets , i.e. flat parts of solutions with normals corresponding to the singular directions .",
    "our study was inspired by the phase transition theory appearing in crystal growth problems and image restoration , where presence of walls and edges plays a significant role , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us describe ideas behind this note .",
    "the key element of the systems we study is the anisotropy . in both cases",
    "this determines the features of solutions .",
    "we will see that numerical experiments appear to give almost the same despite fact that the second equation is not degenerate .",
    "the most spectacular phenomenon which is observed for this type of problems are flat parts of solutions , connected with very strong diffusion , where @xmath3 .",
    "such effects have been well studied for the isotropic total variation flow .",
    "we note that the interest in the tv flow arose from its application to image analysis and reconstruction , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "namely , any regular level sets of solutions to this flow evolve by the mean curvature .",
    "this property is used to smooth out contours and in deblurring .",
    "we stress that numerical algorithms exploit properties of this flow even implicitly .",
    "the case of anisotropic diffusion is not so well studied . despite the available papers like @xcite , @xcite , the mathematical theory is still far from the excellence .",
    "this changes however , because of the interest in algorithms detecting or retaining special image features like edges and corners .",
    "a conspicuous example is the paper @xcite on 2d bar codes .",
    "we observe a growing body of literature devoted to this subject , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we see the need to study evolution equations which are likely to preserve pronounced features of solution or its graphs besides facets , e.g. edges or corners .",
    "it turns out that the equations we study here may serve this purpose .",
    "the rigorous goals will be stated below , but we also present numerical simulations in section [ ronu ] , which illustrate the qualitative features of solutions .",
    "we set the following main goals of this paper :    @xmath4  to study facets , the flat parts of solutions , defined by @xmath3 ;    @xmath4   to exhibit ruled surfaces , arising when one of the components of the gradient of solution @xmath5 vanishes ;    @xmath4  to construct special solutions , given by the explicit formulas which shows characteristic features of solutions ;    @xmath4  to present numerical experiments and to show evolution of interesting model shapes , which were the motivation for looking for analytical results ;    @xmath4  to propose a possible application to image processing .",
    "it is surprising that facets and ruled surfaces are the attributes of solutions to both systems .",
    "the lack of degeneration in the second model results only in smoothing out effect appearing near ` corners ' and some dispersion .",
    "hence in practice , one could find the second equation as more suitable for practical applications . here , we present a series of solutions to both systems , represented by the gray scale .",
    "it shows some interesting differences , which nonetheless are very subtle .",
    "the initial data are represented by the last picture on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "+   +    applications to the phase transition theory are of particular interest , @xcite , however , systems ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) and ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) are rather a simplification of more complex models . in the image processing , usefulness may be more straightforward to see .",
    "the pictures presented in section [ ronu ] show a possibility of reconstructing images .",
    "the diffusion in the second system helps us to restore the picture .",
    "positivity of @xmath6 gives averaging effects , but strong anisotropic nonlinearity keeps edges in the chosen directions .",
    "the upshot of these experiments is the following .",
    "the regularization of a very singular system yields not only smooth solutions but also it preserves the main features of the original equation . we should keep in mind this important observation in our future studies of systems with very singular nonlinear operators .    at this point",
    "we note that the system with the added isotropic diffusion behaves like phase field models with respect to free boundary problems including the mean curvature flow .",
    "we mention just a few papers exploring the link , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    here , we do not plan to present a consistent theory , but rather to pinpoint a few interesting results and phenomena to find motivation for our future deeper mathematical analysis .",
    "in fact , this note can be viewed as an attempt to extend results for one - dimensional systems @xcite on the two - dimensional case . to be more precise ,",
    "we establish existence of solutions to both equations ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) and ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) by using the theory of nonlinear semigroups . for this purpose",
    "we exploit the gradient structure of ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) and ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) .",
    "uniqueness is automatically guaranteed .",
    "this is presented in the next section .",
    "there we also present exact formulas for solutions .",
    "the advantage is that they provide insight into the facet formation problem . since the formulas do not always fit the framework of semigroup solutions , we recall the notion of a weak solution .",
    "the explicit solutions suggest that the flows of ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) and ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) make ruled surfaces out of the initial data , provided additional conditions are satisfied .",
    "this is rigorously established in section [ secon ] .",
    "this considerations require quite precise regularity estimates established in theorem in section [ secreg ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 we state",
    "basic existence results for systems ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) and ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) coming from the general theory .",
    "we point also to a few interesting explicit solutions illustrating typical shapes . in section [ secreg ]",
    "we show that the solutions are of better regularity , provided the initial data are smooth enough .",
    "next we prove conditional results , which explain why flat regions and ruled surfaces are typical for graphs of solutions .",
    "in section [ ronu ] we concentrate on numerical analysis and obtain a few interesting numerical solutions .",
    "these results show more direct phenomena which are able to be captured by the systems . in the appendix we present more complex example of an explicit solutions to ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) .",
    "we will use general tools exploiting the structure of the problem . in order to use the semigroup theory",
    "we notice that we present equations ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) , ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) as gradient flows of corresponding functionals on @xmath7 .",
    "we set @xmath8 @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is an open subset of @xmath2 , possibly unbounded , e.g. @xmath11 .",
    "we study the above equations on a square with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions which is convenient from the numerical point of view , i.e. it is easier to implement a numerical scheme on rectangular domain .",
    "we also consider periodic boundary conditions . in general @xmath12",
    ", however we may scale the time and from now on we put @xmath13 and admit @xmath14 or @xmath15 to have a possibility to study both cases simultaneously .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath16 is well - defined and finite iff @xmath17 .",
    "the correctness of the definition of @xmath18 is less obvious .",
    "in fact , this is an example of a more general situation studied in ( * ? ? ? * section 2 ) .",
    "formula ( [ fi1 ] ) should be understood as follows , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "it is now easy to check that these two functionals are convex , proper and lower semicontinuous on @xmath7 .",
    "we notice that formally , the elliptic operator @xmath21 is the first variation of functional @xmath16 while @xmath22 is the first variation of functional @xmath23 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq_diffanisotv ] ) is the gradient flow of @xmath16 and equation ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) is the gradient flow of @xmath23 . keeping this in mind , we infer the following statement , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    [ tw1 ]",
    "let us suppose that @xmath26 , @xmath25 .",
    "then there exists a unique function @xmath27 such that : + ( 1 ) for all @xmath28 we have @xmath29 ; + ( 2 ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; + ( 3 ) @xmath32 a.e . on @xmath33 ; + ( 4 ) @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 has a right derivative at all @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the minimal section of @xmath38 , ( see @xcite ) .    actually ,",
    "since @xmath39 are subdifferential of convex functional , we say more .",
    "[ tw2 ] let us suppose that @xmath40 and @xmath39 are as in theorem [ tw1 ] , then there exists a unique solution to equation @xmath41 moreover , for all @xmath28 @xmath42 belongs to @xmath43 and ( [ rnsem ] ) holds .",
    "we notice that theorem [ tw1 ] follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , while ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) implies our theorem [ tw2 ] . in theorem",
    "[ tw1 ] we refer to the domains @xmath44 and @xmath45 , however , we abstain from exact description of theses sets .",
    "the semigroups obtained by these theorems are contraction semigroups , thus if @xmath46 in @xmath7 , then for all fixed @xmath47 we have @xmath48",
    ". this observation will be used in the constructions of examples of solutions based on explicit calculations .",
    "this general result gives us the justification for our exact formulas for solutions .",
    "they are particularly valuable when we strive to study motion of facets or other special properties .",
    "first , for special data we cook up explicit formula for a solution to ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) . to keep the simplest setting we consider the equations in the whole plane .",
    "we construct @xmath5 ( see formula ( [ wzor2 ] ) ) a solution to a differential inclusion @xmath49 in place of ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) , with the initial datum @xmath50 this initial condition does not belong to @xmath51 , but @xmath52 @xmath53 the same property will be valid for @xmath54 .",
    "hence the notion of solution introduced in theorem [ tw1 ] by ( [ rnsem ] ) is not quite appropriate .",
    "this is why we introduce in ( [ rnsl ] ) the notion of a weak solution .",

    "we shall calculate @xmath63 .",
    "we obviously obtain @xmath64 the point is to calculate a selection of @xmath65 , where at least one of the components of @xmath66 vanishes . for this purpose , we take advantage of the special structure of this operator , permitting us to use what we learned about the one dimensional case , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath67 this is a lipschitz continuous vector field .",
    "let us check if @xmath5 is a weak solution to ( [ eq_anisotv ] ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath5 is a weak solution iff @xmath68 for each @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 .    here",
    "we put @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is given by ( [ wzor2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath74 is lipschitz continuous , we are allowed to integrate by parts in the second term of the lhs in ( [ rnsl ] ) , getting @xmath75 .",
    "if we take into account the explicit form of @xmath76 , it is easy to see that the identity holds everywhere , except a two - dimensional subset @xmath77 of @xmath78 .",
    "this example was relatively easy to present , because the problem was consider on the whole @xmath2 .",
    "it is also interesting to see if a similar formula works on a bounded domain with a boundary condition . in proposition [ pr2 ] in the appendix",
    ", we present a similar , but more messy formula for a square with neumann boundary data .    the same notion of weak solutions like introduced in ( [ rnsl ] )",
    "may be used also when theorems [ tw1 ] and [ tw2 ] are applicable .",
    "however , it is easy to see that if @xmath5 satisfies ( [ rnsem ] ) , then it is a weak solution in the sense of ( [ rnsl ] ) .",
