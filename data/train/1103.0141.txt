    "because of the consistency of @xmath3 from the kic and spectroscopy and the agreement with the theoretical population study , the higher _ kepler _ effective temperatures are preferred .",
    "we note however , that the existence of a bias arising from the scaling relations can not be excluded .",
    "the mass distribution has one clear peak between 1 and 2 m@xmath29 , while the distribution of the radii shows indications of a dominant peak located at @xmath011  r@xmath29 .",
    "these peaks in the distributions are most likely due to stars in the red clump ,",
    "i.e. he - burning stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a population study of red giants ) .",
    "the radius distribution shows an additional shoulder between roughly 5 and 8  r@xmath29 , which consists most likely of less evolved h - shell burning red giants ascending the giant branch .",
    "the majority of the observed red giants have luminosities between 10 and 100  l@xmath29 and reside at a distance between 1 and 5 kpc .",
    "the steep fall off for low luminosities / shorter distances and the gradual fall off in the number of stars at higher luminosities / larger distances are due to the magnitude range accessible with the _ kepler _ satellite .",
    "note that the masses , radii , luminosities and distances computed from the direct method have relatively large uncertainties . for the radius ,",
    "the majority of the stars have a relative uncertainty of less than 10% , while the distributions of the relative uncertainties in the mass , luminosity and distance peak at about 16% , nearly 20% and 25% , respectively .",
    "these uncertainties are expected to broaden the distributions , but have minimal influence on the location of dominant peaks in the distributions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an in - depth investigation ) .",
    "for 71% ( 11805 out of 16511 ) of the red giants , as defined by @xcite , solar - like oscillations could be detected . comparing this fraction with the performance of corot",
    ", we see that @xcite detect oscillations in 75% of the red - giant candidates brighter than 13@xmath30 mag .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with each other",
    ". what could be the reason that we do not detect oscillations in the other 29% of the stars ? this could be either due to analysis or observation biases , or due to intrinsic effects in the stars .",
    "all stars have been analysed with an automated method @xcite and checked by eye .",
    "this makes sure that the detection of solar - like oscillations is not significantly influenced by the automation .",
    "the observations are such that we are able to observe oscillations with @xmath1 only in the range between roughly 10 and 250 @xmath10hz .",
    "the lower limit is due both to the frequency resolution and to the presence of low frequency signatures , among which granulation , present in the power spectra .",
    "the upper limit is set by the nyquist frequency of @xmath0283  @xmath10hz . from @xmath4 and",
    "effective temperature we computed a prediction for @xmath1 for the stars for which no oscillations were detected . for @xmath04200 stars the predicted @xmath1 were indeed outside the frequency range for which the current data are sensitive .",
    "furthermore , artefacts such as the signature of the cycling of the heater on one of the _ kepler _ reaction wheels ( as already reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* and in the _ kepler _ data release notes ) might also hamper the detection of the oscillations .",
    "contamination from other instrumental effects or photon - shot noise may also be relevant . additionally , we found during the manual check that there are some binaries and classical oscillators present in the sample which features hamper the detection of solar - like oscillations .",
    "note that for binaries the kic estimate of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are rather doubtful .",
    "@xcite give a conservative estimate of only 1.2% eclipsing binaries in the sample .      despite the relatively large uncertainties in the stellar parameters ( mass , radius , luminosity ) of individual stars the statistically significant number of stars allows us to perform a global investigation of the parameters of the complete sample and investigate the population of stars .",
    "for this investigation of the population of red giants for which oscillations have been detected we show @xmath1 versus @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ res ] , in the same way as @xcite , but now with colour - coding for mass , radius , luminosity and effective temperature also included .",
    "the mass , radius and luminosity of the stars in this diagram show smooth transitions with the global oscillation parameters , as predicted from stellar models .",
    "however the trends in global oscillation parameters appear to be almost independent of effective temperature . in the same figure",
    ", we also show h - r diagrams colour - coded for radius and mass , and mass versus radius diagrams colour - coded for luminosity and effective temperature .",

    ". stars with masses roughly between 2 and 3  m@xmath29 and radii between 7.5 and 10  r@xmath29 seem to form a separate branch in the mass versus radius diagram with slightly increased temperatures ( panel f in fig .  [ res ] ) .",
    "these stars are also visible in the @xmath1 versus @xmath31 diagram and in the @xmath1 histogram ( fig .  [ dnunumaxhisto ] ) at the expected location of the secondary clump @xcite .",
    "these are stars in their he - burning phase , which are massive enough to have ignited he - burning in a non - degenerate core .",
    "we therefore identify these stars as _ secondary - clump stars_. * the high - mass stars ( @xmath34  3.5  m@xmath29 ) form a distinct group of stars at high @xmath31 and @xmath1 values similar to the red - clump stars ( see panel a of fig .",
    "[ res ] ) .",
    "these stars also have large radii and high luminosities .",

    "[ res ] ) .",
    "this indicates the maximum @xmath1 of he - burning stars and the region with larger @xmath1 is populated exclusively with h - shell burning red giant branch stars @xcite .",
    "the lack of high - mass stars in the red - giant branch is consistent with high - mass stars evolving much faster than their low - mass counter parts during the h - shell burning phase .",
    "the boundaries of each specific stage of stellar evolution as indicated above are approximate values and could be established thanks to the large sample of stars investigated , despite the relatively large uncertainties in the parameters of individual stars .",
    "the different populations identified above are indicated in the h - r diagram , mass versus radius diagram and @xmath1 versus @xmath31 diagram in the left column of fig .",
    "[ popres ] .",
    "two distinct unidentified regions are still apparent in the h - r diagram , i.e. the black dots above and below the red clump .",
    "the more luminous stars have masses between 2 and 3.5  m@xmath29 and @xmath1 between 25 and 80  @xmath10hz , which could be either in the h - shell or he - core / h - shell burning stars .",
    "the stars below the red clump are stars with @xmath28  @xmath32  2  m@xmath29 , @xmath27  @xmath17  7.5  r@xmath29 and @xmath1  @xmath17  45  @xmath10hz . these are most likely stars in the h - shell burning phase ascending the red - giant branch .    for the analysis described above we used the kic effective temperatures and derived masses and radii directly from the scaling relations ( eq .  [ numax ] and [ dnu ] ) .",
    "we now compare these results with results from a grid - based approach using information from a grid of models to compute the seismic effective temperatures , masses , radii and luminosities of the stars @xcite . in the grid - based approach stellar evolution",
    "is taken into account , while the scaling relations assume that all values of @xmath3 are possible for a star of a given mass and radius .",
    "using the grid - based approach should therefore reduce the uncertainties of the determined parameters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the results from the grid - based approach are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ popres ] .",
    "the grid - based approach indeed improves the structure in the h - r diagram , mass versus radius diagram and @xmath1 versus @xmath31 diagram , but does not alter the identification of the different populations , except for the high - mass population .",
    "the stars with masses between 4 and 6  m@xmath29 as computed from the direct method have all been corrected to have masses with @xmath28  @xmath32  4  m@xmath29 and the high - mass stars population has been reduced .",
    "these corrections indicate that for the stars with highest masses the uncertainties in the kic and the direct method overestimate the stellar masses .",
    "the fraction of red giants for which oscillations have been detected has its maximum at roughly @xmath4  =  2.7 and @xmath3  =  4800  k and decreases for higher and lower values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fracloggteff ] ) .",

    "these stars have very large radii and are expected to have long oscillation periods , for which ( as stated above ) the timespan of the q1 data are not sufficient .",
    "it is also clear that for hotter stars ( @xmath3  @xmath17  5200  k ) with higher gravity ( @xmath4  @xmath17  3 ) less oscillating stars have been detected .",
    "these stars are in a less evolved state , in which possible solar - like oscillations occur at frequencies higher than the nyquist frequency ( 283  @xmath10hz ) of the long cadence _",

    "we also checked the fraction of detections as a function of magnitude .",
    "this shows no clear trend .",
    "the ratios of stars in each magnitude interval with detected oscillations to stars without detections are very similar .",
    "this shows that the detection of solar - like oscillations in red - giant stars does not depend ( strongly ) on the apparent magnitude .",

    "there are also many fewer oscillating kasc red giants with @xmath36  3.5 .",
    "the lack of kasc stars in both regions could possibly be caused by selection effects , and low number statistics due to the fact that in these regions in the h - r diagram stars evolve relatively rapidly and thus that the chance of observing a star in this region is lower .",
    "indeed the astrometric control set , the largest component of kasc analysed red giants , was selected to have large distances , hence low @xmath4 .",
    "finally , in the low @xmath4 - low @xmath3 range where hardly any oscillations have been detected in the public data , we see a non - negligible number of oscillating kasc stars .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the kasc timeseries analysed are three months longer than the public data analysed here .",

    "the spread in @xmath40 is notably smaller than in the kic values with the majority of the stars having @xmath40 roughly between 2.3 and 2.7 .",

    "furthermore , the lack of high - mass stars with high @xmath1 ( @xmath17  110  @xmath10hz ) confirms observationally the theoretically known difference in evolutionary timescales between stars of different masses .    the fact that we did not detect oscillations for 29% of the red giants in the sample can be explained by observational influences , such as the limited timespan of the data and instrumental artefacts .",

    "<S> the first public release of long - cadence stellar photometric data collected by the nasa _ kepler _ mission has now been made available . in this paper we characterise the red - giant ( g - k ) stars in this large sample in terms of their solar - like oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we use published methods and well - known scaling relations in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> just over 70% of the red giants in the sample show detectable solar - like oscillations , and from these oscillations we are able to estimate the fundamental properties of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> this asteroseismic analysis reveals different populations : low - luminosity h - shell burning red - giant branch stars , cool high - luminosity red giants on the red - giant branch and he - core burning clump and secondary - clump giants .    </S>",
