    "the central issue in mri research is its nonlinear properties , in particular , the saturation amplitude of the instability .",
    "although the key processes governing the nonlinear saturation are scoped by global and local numerical studies , it is not fully explained yet ( hawley & balbus 1992 ; hawley et al .",

    "recently , lesur & ogilvie ( 2008 ) argue that , in the shearing box context with zero - net vertical flux , mhd turbulence is sustained through nonlinear classical dynamo activity once the mri is operated .",
    "it would be necessary and significative to study the saturation process from the microscopic viewpoint of the physical sustaining mechanism for mhd turbulence as they have done .",
    "ohmic dissipation is one of the crucial processes that determine the saturation amplitude of the mri .",
    "linear growth rate of the mri can be reduced significantly because of the suppression by ohmic dissipation .",
    "two- and three - dimensional local shearing box simulations ( sano et al . 1998 , 2004 ; sano & stone 2002 ) have shown that physical properties of the saturated turbulence depend on the lundquist number @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath12 is the angular velocity , and @xmath13 is the magnetic diffusivity ( see also fleming et al .",
    "2000 ; ziegler & rdiger 2001 ; liu et al .",
    "particularly , when @xmath14 , the size of the saturated stress decreases with the decrease of @xmath15 ( sano & stone 2002 ; pessah et al .",
    "it is also pointed out that magnetic reconnection plays an important role in the energy dissipation of mri driven turbulence ( sano & inutsuka 2001 ) .",
    "numerical issues are one of the main reasons why the saturation physics of the mri is remained to be understood .",
    "fromang & papaloizou ( 2007 ) demonstrate the efficiency of angular momentum transport decreases linearly with the grid spacing as the resolution increases .",
    "although it is very difficult to distinguish between the numerical and physical factors working as the saturation mechanism ( king et al .",
    "2007 ; silvers 2007 ) , current researches of the mri pay much attention to the numerical factors with the greatest care .",
    "pessah et al .",
    "( 2007 ) derive a scaling law of the saturated stress from past wide variety of numerical results by analytically eliminating the numerical factors such as box size and resolutions .",
    "more straightforward way for decontaminating the numerical factors is to bring explicitly the physical diffusivities much larger than the numerical one into the computational study .",
    "lesur & longaretti ( 2007 ) have performed first systematic study of the mri in the presence of both viscous and magnetic dissipations , which are larger than the numerical diffusivities . for the cases with nonzero net flux of the vertical field ,",
    "the transport property in the saturated state depends on the magnetic prandtl number @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "fromang et al . (",
    "2007 ) have reported that in zero magnetic flux cases the turbulent activity is an increasing function of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath18 .",
    "linear behaviors of the mri in the presence of both the viscosity and resistivity are analytically studied by pessah & chan ( 2008 ) comprehensively .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number @xmath18 takes a wide range of values in astrophysical disk systems . in protoplanetary disks surrounding young stellar objects ,",
    "the magnetic prandtl number is much smaller than unity because of their low ionization degree ( nakano 1984 ; umebayashi & nakano 1988 ; sano et al . 2000 ) . in accretion disks of compact x - ray sources and active galactic nuclei , the magnetic prandtl number ranges from @xmath19 to @xmath20 depending on the distance from the central object ( balbus & henri 2008 ) . in collapsar disks which is known as the central engine of gamma - ray bursts ( woosley 1993 )",
    ", the physical state with high magnetic prandtl number of @xmath21 is expected to be realized in their evolutionary stage as a result of the large neutrino viscosity ( masada et al .",
    "therefore , more systematic and deeper study on the mri in the presence of both the viscosity and resistivity is quite important for understanding the accretion process triggered by the mri in various disk systems",
    ".    one important unsettled matter , in these situations , is the role of the kinematic viscosity at the nonlinear stage of the mri . in general , the viscosity as well as the magnetic resistivity can suppress the growth of the mri .",
    "however the dependence of nonlinear outcome on the prandtl number indicates that the role of the viscosity in mri turbulence could be different from that of the resistivity .",
    "then , the main purpose of this paper is to reveal nonlinear features of the mri in viscous accretion disks .",
    "as is described in what follows , linear growth of the mri is characterized by the reynolds number @xmath0 in the viscous fluid , and by the lundquist number @xmath22 in the resistive fluid .",
    "focusing on these two non - dimensional parameters , we clarify the difference in nonlinear behaviors of the mri between the viscous and resistive systems .",

    "nonlinear behavior of the mri is investigated by two - dimensional mhd simulations taking account of the viscous terms .",

    "the viscous dissipation affects the growth of the mri when the damping rate is comparable to the shear rate for a perturbation",
    ". then the viscous damping rate of the unstable mode would be balanced with the shear rate in the viscous regime , @xmath49 .",
    "this relation gives the most unstable wavenumber @xmath50 , and thus @xmath51 .",
    "since the maximum growth rate of the mri is equal to the alfvn frequency of the fastest growing mode , it corresponds to @xmath52 , or @xmath53 .",
    "this is why the normalized wavenumber and growth rate of the fastest growing mode are proportional to the @xmath43 in the presence of large viscous dissipation .",
    "note that the @xmath4-dependence of the fastest growing mode is slightly different from that on the lundquist number ( @xmath22 ) in the presence of ohmic dissipation ( sano & miyama 1999 ) , where @xmath13 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "based on the linear analysis , the resistivity can suppress the mri more efficiently compared to the viscosity . in the resistive regime",
    ", the ohmic dissipation can suppress the mri when the dissipation time of the unstable mode is comparable to the alfvn time , @xmath54 , thus the most unstable wavelength is given by @xmath55 .",

    "for elucidating the nonlinear features of the mri , viscous mhd equations are solved with a finite - differencing code which was developed by sano et al .",

    ", the reynolds number must be @xmath98 .",
    "we investigate the growth rate at the early linear phase in order to confirm the accuracy of our numerical scheme .",
    "all the simulations begin with random perturbation of very small amplitude so that any growing modes should be well described by a linear analysis during the first few orbits of the evolution .",
    "the time history of each mode is followed through a two - dimensional fourier decomposition carried out at frequent time intervals .",
    "we define the fourier coefficient @xmath99 of the radial velocity @xmath100 as @xmath101 here we select the modes with @xmath102 because they are the most unstable .",

    "the two - channel flow is an axisymmetric mri mode whose vertical wavelength fits the vertical box size .",
    "this linearly unstable mode is also an exact solution of nonlinear mhd equations , so that the magnetic field can be amplified exponentially even at the nonlinear regime ( goodman & xu 1994 ) .",
    "similar behavior is found in all the viscous models even though the reynolds number is much smaller than unity .",

    "the time evolution of @xmath120 , which is the sum of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , is shown in figure  [ fig4]a .",

    "we can derive the last term of above equation by assuming that the radial gradient of the perturbed azimuthal velocity is negligible , that is @xmath131 .",
    "the energy injection rate through the radial boundary is proportional to the kinematic viscous stress as well as the turbulent stress @xmath132 at the boundary .    using the volume - averaged values instead of the surface - averaged ones at the radial boundary ,",
    "the volume average of the total energy changing rate @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the energy injection rate caused by the turbulent stress ( sano & inutsuka 2001 ) , and @xmath136 is done by the kinematic viscous stress . the second term is always positive . when the turbulent stress is positive , the total energy of the system must increase .",
    "the source of the input energy is the background shear motion . in realistic disk systems ,",
    "positive stresses lead to inward mass accretion , bringing a loss of gravitational energy .",
    "the gain in total energy in the shearing box represents this energy release .",

    "the time average is taken at @xmath154 .",
    "this indicates that a large portion of the injected energy is converted into the magnetic energy of the system .",
    "because the system is almost incompressible , the dominant heating mechanism in our simulations should be the kinematic viscous heating .",

    "the ratio of these components is evaluated as @xmath155 in the range @xmath154 .",
    "this fraction becomes smaller and smaller for the cases with larger reynolds number .",
    "the rest of the heating is caused by the numerical magnetic dissipation .",
    "then our results suggest that the magnetic dissipation is the dominant mechanism of heating at the nonlinear phase of the mri and might play an essential role for the suppression of mri driven turbulence .",
    "actually in the resistive mhd cases , the heating of the system is controlled by the joule heating almost completely ( sano & inutsuka 2001 ) .",
    "the energy changing rates in a very resistive model with the lundquist number @xmath156 is demonstrated in figure  [ fig6]b .",

    "diamond - shape shows the results in the viscous fluid and cross - shape is that in the resistive one .",
    "note that these are not the saturated values .",
    "upward arrow over - plotted on the symbols denotes that the value is the lower limit , because @xmath163 is still increasing with time .",
    "the downward arrow stands for decaying models and thus the stress is the upper limit",
    ".    the stress at the nonlinear stage are almost the same when the diffusion is weak ( @xmath124 or @xmath164 ) .",
    "however , a huge difference can be seen in the highly diffusive regime . in the presence of the ohmic dissipation",
    ", the stress rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath123 .",
    "for the models with the kinematic viscosity , on the other hand , it increases with the decrease of @xmath4 .",
    "the origin of this difference between viscous and ohmic dissipative systems is discussed later in   4.1 .",
    "the inverse correlation between @xmath165 and @xmath4 for the cases with large viscosity could be originated from stable growth of a channel flow .",
    "this is because the large viscosity can suppress the growth of any other modes than the two - channel flow , and thus the channel mode can evolve up to highly nonlinear amplitude .",
    "the viscosity may enhance the saturation amplitude of the mri .",
    "however , our results are restricted in two - dimensional simulations .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the mri in three - dimension must be quite different , because the channel flow is known to be unstable to the nonaxisymmetric parasitic instability ( goodman & xu 1994 ) .",
    "we are planning to perform three - dimensional study of the mri for verifying these nonlinear properties in the viscous accretion disks .",
    "to give a physical explanation for the nonlinear behavior of the axisymmetric mri , we focus on the critical wavelength obtained from the linear theory in this section",

    "shaded area denotes the linearly unstable regions for the mri . assuming fixed diffusivities , @xmath123 and @xmath4 increase as the instability grows because they are proportional to the squared alfvn velocity .",
    "then the horizontal axis in figure  [ fig8 ] can be regarded as the time direction in terms of the evolution of the mri .",
    "first , we consider the resistive case shown by figure  [ fig8]a . for the case of @xmath126 ,",
    "the critical wavelength is described as @xmath168 . at the nonlinear stage of the two - dimensional mri",
    ", mhd turbulence decays and it saturates only when @xmath126 ( see figs .  [ fig4]b and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted schematically using the @xmath169-@xmath123 diagram ( sano & miyama 1999 ) . as the mri grows and amplifies the magnetic field , the critical wavelength shifts to the shorter length - scale .",
    "then , many smaller scale fluctuations can become unstable .",
    "those structures enhance the efficiency of ohmic dissipation in the turbulent state . in other words",
    ", the system evolves toward a more dissipative state , and could be saturated at a critical point around @xmath170 , at which the critical wavelength reaches the shortest value and the ohmic dissipation is the most efficient .",
    "in this way , mhd turbulence can decay if @xmath126 .",
    "when @xmath125 , on the other hand , the critical wavelength is given by @xmath171 .",
    "two - dimensional calculations of the mri suggests that the unstable growth can not saturate if @xmath125 . the nonlinear behavior in these cases can be explained by figure  [ fig8]a analogously as follows : at the linear evolutionary stage , the critical wavelength in the radial direction becomes longer due to the exponential growth of the radial field component , while the vertical field grows slower than exponentially .",
    "the wavevectors of the unstable modes thus become parallel to the vertical axis .",
    "this channel flow mode is the exact solution of the nonlinear mhd equations ( goodman & xu 1994 ) .",
    "as the field strength becomes larger , the critical wavelength shifts to the longer one .",
    "the dissipation can be much less effective , and thus the channel solution continues to grow without saturation .",
    "next , let us consider the viscous case shown in figure  [ fig8]b . in the viscous fluid",
    ", the critical wavelength is given by @xmath171 despite the size of the reynolds number ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . even if @xmath172 is much smaller than unity , the critical wavelength thus shifts to larger scale as the instability grows .",
    "then the system always evolves toward a less dissipative state and is not saturated .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with our numerical results shown in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "these results indicates that the saturation process of the mri would be changed dramatically at the critical point at which the critical wavelength switches from the decreasing function of the field strength to the increasing one .",
    "the differences in the nonlinear behavior of the mri between the viscous and resistive systems would be originated from whether the critical point exists or not .      in this subsection",
    ", we apply the discussion above to the doubly diffusive system that includes both the viscosity and resistivity .",
    "the saturation behavior of the axisymmetric mri can be anticipated by the dependence of the critical wavelength on the field strength derived from the linear theory . with the same framework used in   2 , a local axisymmetric dispersion equation of the mri in the presence of both viscous and ohmic dissipations is given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 ( menou et al .",
    "2006 ; masada et al . 2007 ;",
    "lesur & longaretti 2007 ; pessah & chan 2008 ) .",
    "this equation is , as expected , characterized by @xmath175 and @xmath123 .",
    "here we focus on the system with a constant magnetic prandtl number ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] demonstrates the critical wavelength of the mri as a function of @xmath123 for various values of @xmath18 obtained by solving the dispersion equation ( 18 ) .",
    "the @xmath123-dependence of the critical wavelength varies with the size of @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath8 , the linear growth of the mri is independent of the magnetic prandtl number , and the critical wavelength is almost identical to the pure resistive case ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "however , if the viscosity effects is added sufficiently , then the critical wavelength is enlarged by the suppression due to the viscosity in the middle range of @xmath123 . for the cases of @xmath7 , the critical wavelength around @xmath170",
    "is given by @xmath178 ( pessah & chan 2008 ) .",
    "although the critical wavelength shifts to longer length - scales as the magnetic prandtl number increases , the critical wavelength has a minimum value for all the cases .",
    "this implies that the mri turbulence could be suppressed if the lundquist number is less than a critical value .",
    "this diagram suggests that the critical lundquist number @xmath179 depends on @xmath18 . the critical lundquist number @xmath179 is plotted as a function of @xmath18 in figure  [ fig10]a . in the regime of @xmath7 , it is proportional to the square root of the magnetic prandtl number , that is @xmath180 .",
    "in contrast , it remains to be constant in the range @xmath8 . since the critical reynolds number is given by @xmath181",
    ", we can also obtain the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath182 , and which is depicted in figure  [ fig10]b .",
    "nonlinear growth of the mri can be expected in the parameter region above this critical curve .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number is proportional to @xmath183 in the regime of @xmath7 and @xmath184 when @xmath8 .",
    "this curve is reminiscent of the critical curve for mhd turbulence sketched from nonlinear simulations of mri ( fromang et al .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath4 in their models are at most a few tens in fromang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is different from @xmath4 in this paper .",
    "the relation between these two is @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the maxwell stress normalized by the ( initial ) pressure . ] , and the critical magnetic prandtl number is around unity .",
    "thus our prediction is roughly consistent with nonlinear results even quantitatively .",
    "note that the critical curve shown by figure  [ fig10 ] is obtained by using only the features of the linear dispersion relation of mri .",
    "this implies that the linear growth of the mri is very important even at the nonlinear saturated phase to sustain mhd turbulence .",
    "the discussion in this paper is based only on two - dimensional simulations of the mri . for the understanding",
    "the saturation mechanism of the mri , it is quite important to perform the systematic three - dimensional analysis of the mri in the presence of multiple diffusivities .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of the local shearing box could affect the nonlinear evolution of the viscous mri .",
    "the necessary ingredients of the unstable growth of the mri are the velocity shear and the magnetic field . in the numerical setting of the local shearing box ,",
    "the velocity profile of the background shear flow can not disappear by the role of the kinematic viscosity , but is imposed by the boundary conditions .",
    "it would be very interesting to use global disk models to investigate the mri in highly viscous disks .",
    "these are our next tasks .",
    "axisymmetric mri in viscous accretion disks is investigated by linear and nonlinear analyses .",
    "a local shearing box threaded by a uniform vertical magnetic field is used for our nonlinear simulations .",
    "the nonlinear results of the viscous mri are compared with the resistive case focusing on two non - dimensional parameters , the reynolds number for the mri @xmath4 and the lundquist number for the mri @xmath123 .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . in axisymmetric two - dimensional simulations",
    ", the mri continues growing regardless of the size of the reynolds number .",
    "when @xmath187 , the stress in its nonlinear stage is inversely correlated with @xmath4 , and thus can be larger than that in the ideal mhd run . in the highly resistive fluid ,",
    "on the other hand , the growth of the mri is saturated and mhd turbulence dies away . when the lundquist number is less than unity , the saturated stress decreases dramatically with decreasing @xmath188 .    \\2 . at the nonlinear stage of the mri",
    ", a large portion of the injected energy is converted to the magnetic energy in the viscous system ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the thermal energy gain is much larger than the viscous heating rate .",
    "in contrast , for the case of the resistive system , the thermal energy is converted from the magnetic energy through the joule heating .",
    "this difference in the energy dissipation efficiency may affect the saturation process of the mri .",
    "nonlinear behavior of the mri in the single diffusive system can be understood with the help of the local dispersion relation .",
    "the key characteristic is the dependence of the critical wavelength on the reynolds number @xmath4 and the lundquist number @xmath190 . applying this interpretation to the doubly diffusive system with both the viscous and ohmic dissipations , a condition for sustaining mri driven turbulence",
    "is obtained as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath123 .",
