    "<S> for this , we use a similar idea for obtaining an approximate solution for chordal vertex deletion due to jansen and pilipczuk ( soda 17 ) to obtain an approximate solution with @xmath7 vertices when the problem is a yes - instance , and use mader s @xmath8-path theorem to hit all obstructions containing exactly one vertex of the approximate solution . then we exploit the structure of split decompositions of distance - hereditary graphs to reduce the total size . using mader </S>",
