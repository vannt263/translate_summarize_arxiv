    "detections of high galactic standard - of - rest velocity ( ) peaks in the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) commissioning data were reported by @xcite across all fields at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite interpreted the high-  peaks as being due to stars in the galactic bar .",
    "however , the peaks are not statistically significant in a number of fields @xcite and no high-  peaks were found at negative longitudes in the bulge radial velocity assay ( brava ) , at @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite . additionally , no high-  peaks can be found in pure @xmath6-body models @xcite . @xcite demonstrated that resonant ( 2:1 and higher order ) orbits , viewed on their own , were able to generate high-  peaks .",
    "@xcite proposed that such resonant orbits are populated by young stars recently trapped by the bar ; they argued that the apogee selection function is biased toward such young stars .",
    "bars have been implicated in building large gas reservoirs at the centers of galaxies , fuelling high star formation rates there . as in other barred galaxies , the milky way ( mw ) s bar funnels gas inwards @xcite .",
    "this gas gives rise to structures such as the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , spanning @xmath7 .",
    "the cmz contains @xmath8 of molecular gas @xcite , driving a star formation rate of @xmath9yr@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a molecular gas disk extends across @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite interpreted the observed molecular , atomic and ionized gas outside the cmz to galactic longitude @xmath13 as a ( tilted ) disk with semi - major axis of radius @xmath14 with a hole at its center . in external galaxies ,",
    "star formation in nuclear rings builds nuclear disks @xcite . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that the high-  peaks in the line of sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) are consistent with the presence of a nuclear disk in the mw .",
    "here we use a high resolution simulation , with gas and star formation , which develops a bar , driving gas to the center and forming a stellar nuclear disk @xcite , to derive the kinematic signatures of such a disk .",
    "we use these to guide our interpretation of the apogee data release 12 @xcite stellar velocity data for the inner mw .",
    "while the simulation was not designed to match the mw , @xcite showed that the nuclear disk that it forms is qualitatively similar to those in external galaxies .",
    "the simulation was evolved with the @xmath6-body@xmath15smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gasoline @xcite .",
    "the galaxy forms out of gas cooling off a hot corona in pressure equilibrium within a dark matter halo of virial mass @xmath16 . both the dark matter halo and the initial gas corona",
    "are represented by @xmath17 particles . as the gas cools and reaches high density ,",
    "star formation is triggered .",
    "star particles then provide feedback via winds from massive stars , and types ia and ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "gas particles all have initial mass of @xmath18 and star particles are spawned from gas with @xmath19 of this mass .",
    "this high mass resolution allows us to use a high star formation threshold of 100 @xmath20 for the gas @xcite . by the end of the simulation",
    "the galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath21 in @xmath22 particles .",
    "this large number of star particles provides a very fine sampling of the mass distribution at the center of the model .",
    "further details of the simulation are provided in @xcite    the bar forms at around 4 gyr . after 6 gyr",
    "a prominent nuclear disk starts to form which , by 10 gyr , has a semi - major axis of @xmath23 .",
    "the nuclear disk is perpendicular to the bar and its stellar streaming is perpendicular to the bar s . at 10 gyr",
    "the nuclear disk in the simulation is quite massive and is thus unlikely to match any nuclear disk in the mw .",
    "therefore here we consider the model at two earlier times : at @xmath24  gyr , before the nuclear disk forms , and at @xmath25  gyr when a strong nuclear disk is established . aside from the nuclear disk becoming more massive and the bar growing longer ,",
    "the model at 10  gyr is not qualitatively different from at .      in order to compare to the mw , we rescale the model in both size and velocity .",
    "size rescaling is accomplished by matching the size of the bar to that of the mw . between  and",
    "the average size of the bar in the simulation , as measured from the radius at which the phase of the @xmath26 fourier moment deviates from a constant by more than @xmath27 @xcite , is 2.1  kpc . assuming that the mw s bar has a semi - major axis of @xmath28 @xcite , we scale all coordinates by a factor of 1.67 .",
    "( scaling to the more up - to - date bar size of @xcite , @xmath29 , leads to a nuclear disk which is much too large ; because we seek a closer nuclear disk size match , we scale to the older bar size , but this is not to imply that the real mw bar semi - major axis is closer to @xmath30 than @xmath31 . ) the velocity scale factor is obtained by a least - squares fit to the line of sight velocity dispersion of the model to abundances and radial velocity galactic origins survey @xcite data for all stars within galactocentric radius @xmath32  at @xmath4 = @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath27 across @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain a velocity scaling factor of 0.48 .",
    "while these scalings lead to a model of roughly the right size and rotational velocity we stress that the model still does not match the mw and we only use it to qualitatively predict the expected trends in the mw , not their magnitude or precise location .",
    "we assume that the sun is 8  from the galactic center , and place the observer at @xmath36 .",
    "we orient the bar at @xmath37 to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "since we compare our model with apogee @xcite data , which targets bright red giant stars , we adopt a uniform selection function for star particles at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the distance from the sun @xcite .",
    "reducing the maximum @xmath39 to 8 kpc does not significantly alter our conclusions .",
    "we use an opening angle of @xmath40 for each losvd , to match the size of the smallest apogee bulge fields .",
    "the ( off - plane ) line of sight with the least particles contains over 2800 star particles while the best sampled ( mid - plane ) field has over 57,000 star particles ; thus the shapes of the model losvds are well determined .",
    "the top row of figure [ fig : losvds ] shows the model s surface density distribution .",
    "viewing the model from the solar perspective , we measure the distribution of line of sight velocities in the galactocentric restframe , .",
    "figure [ fig : losvds ] shows the losvds for various lines - of - sight ( indicated in the top row ) in the mid - plane ( @xmath41 , second row ) and off - plane ( @xmath42 , third row ) . at  each losvd at @xmath43 has a single peak , both in the mid - plane and off the plane .",
    "the losvds have a shoulder to high , which @xcite showed is produced by stars at large distances seen close to tangentially .",
    "the peak in  moves to larger velocities with increasing @xmath44 , but remains well below the galaxy s circular velocity . by  the losvds at @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "have developed a second , high-  peak .",
    "this peak is more prominent than the low-  peak , due to the model s very vigorous star formation in the nuclear disk , roughly ten times higher than in the mw for the corresponding region .",
    "this very high star formation rate quickly leads to a relatively massive nuclear disk ; thus the relative amplitudes of the low- and high-  peaks are _ not _ predictions of the model .",
    "indeed if we reduce the weight of star particles younger than 1  by a factor of 5 , to compensate for the high star formation rate of the model , then the high-  peaks become smaller than the main peaks , as seen in figure [ fig : losvds ] .",
    "the distribution around the high-  peak is narrower (  cooler ) than that around the main peak and is skewed toward low .",
    "interior to @xmath45 , the losvds are broadened relative to those at , but no high-  peak is evident . at @xmath47",
    "no high-  peak is present in the mid - plane , indicating that the structure responsible for the feature does not extend this far . the off - plane and mid - plane losvds are not substantially different at , aside from the mid - plane hosting more stars at @xmath48 . at the high-  peaks , which dominate the mid - plane ,",
    "are entirely absent in the @xmath49 losvds",
    ". therefore the presence of a nuclear disk is only evident in the mid - plane . as in the mw , outside the nuclear disk",
    ", the off - plane losvds at @xmath50 also contain a statistically significant high-  peak / shoulder , but this is also present at , and is not related to the nuclear disk .",
    "thus the kinematic signatures of a nuclear disk are ( 1 ) a second , high-  peak at roughly the circular velocity , ( 2 ) which is absent a few degrees off the mid - plane , ( 3 ) is kinematically cooler than the low-  peak , and ( 4 ) is skewed toward low .",
    "the top row of figure [ fig : losvds ] shows color - coded maps of the average , ; the peak velocities at orbit tangent points manifest as the characteristic `` winged '' pattern of the  fields .",
    "although the two  maps show the model before and after the nuclear disk forms , they are not very different , indicating that the formation of the nuclear disk does not lead to a wholesale change of the galaxy as much as populating new parts of its phase space . at the low longitudes of the nuclear disk ,",
    "large occurs only close to the galactic center while at other radii is smaller .",
    "even with a survey the size of apogee , the number of stars in individual fields is still relatively small , giving a low signal - to - noise ratio for any second peak in any one field @xcite . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we note that the  of the second peak does not change significantly with longitude at @xmath51 .",
    "therefore by stacking the losvds we can enhance the signal - to - noise ratio of the high-  peak .",
    "because the main peak is dominated by stars streaming along the bar , and  of these changes with @xmath44 , the main peak in a stacked losvd will be quite broad . if we include @xmath52 , then the exponentially higher density of disk and bar stars near the center masks out any features at high . in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : losvds ] we present a stack of the model s losvds at @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath27 . as with the individual losvds ,",
    "a peak at high  is evident at  in the mid - plane but is absent at @xmath42 .",
    "moreover this second peak is still cooler than the low-  peak , and remains skewed toward it .",
    "thus stacking losvds preserves the kinematic signatures of a nuclear disk , and provides a reliable method for searching for a nuclear disk in the apogee data .",
    "we select apogee survey stars in the fields of interest , excluding stars with the star bad flag ( corresponding to poor stellar parameter fits ) and those flagged as flux and telluric standards .",
    "stars with a velocity scatter between different visits of more than @xmath55 are also removed .",
    "( the same analysis including also stars flagged as star bad , which leads to 763 in the plane and 1401 out of the plane , gives results in agreement with the more conservative cut . )",
    "the small numbers of stars in the apogee commissioning data resulted in peaks with low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we increase the statistical significance of a high-  peak by stacking the apogee dr12 data in the longitude range @xmath56 for fields in the mid - plane and off - plane at @xmath0 ( totalling 617 and 1114 stars , respectively ) .",
    "table [ tab : fields ] lists the fields stacked together and the number of stars used from each field .",
    "( blue histogram ) .",
    "the fields used are listed in table 1 .",
    "the black lines show the two gaussians fitted to the mid - plane losvd . ]",
    "figure [ fig : apogeevgsrstack ] plots these two stacked apogee losvds .",
    "the mid - plane stack has a clear second peak at @xmath57 , corresponding to roughly the circular velocity of the mw in the bulge region @xcite .",
    "no comparable second peak is visible in the off - plane stacked losvd , which is non - gaussian and skewed toward high ,  it has a shoulder to high  @xcite .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the null hypothesis that the mid - plane and off - plane losvds are drawn from the same distribution has a relatively low @xmath58-value of @xmath59 .",
    "we fit two gaussians to the mid - plane stacked losvd in the range @xmath60 , constrained such that the smaller gaussian contains less than @xmath61 of the stars ( to avoid fitting just the skewed low-  distribution with two gaussians ) .",
    "we obtain a low-  component having mean velocity @xmath62 and standard deviation @xmath63 , while the high-  component has @xmath64 and @xmath65 , making it cooler than the low-  component .",
    "these two gaussians are also shown in figure [ fig : apogeevgsrstack ] .",
    "the velocity distribution at @xmath66 hints at a skewness opposite to that of the main distribution , but the signal - to - noise ratio is still too low for a robust measurement .    the high-  gaussian has a significant number of stars associated with it , and is significantly separated from the low-  gaussian . in order to test the likelihood of such a second peak arising purely from poisson noise , we perform monte - carlo tests drawing 617 stars from the off - plane stacked losvd . fitting two gaussians as before to the resulting losvd",
    ", we label as @xmath67 and @xmath68 the low- and high-  components , respectively .",
    "we repeat this procedure 100,000 times , and for each we compute @xmath69 , the ratio of stars in the high-  component to the total number of stars , and the overlap of the two components , defined as @xmath70 the results are presented in figure [ fig : statistics ] ; the observed mid - plane stacked losvd has @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "only @xmath73 of the monte - carlo samples have @xmath74 , while none of them have overlap @xmath75 , showing that the observed double - peaked mid - plane stacked losvd is highly unlikely to result from poisson noise .",
    "the apogee data therefore show a statistically significant double - gaussian losvd in the mid - plane , the properties of which agree with 3 of the 4 kinematic signatures of a nuclear disk from the simulation . while the signal - to - noise is too low to be sure if the high-  peak is skewed to low , the data are suggestive that it is .",
    "therefore a kiloparsec - scale nuclear disk can explain the high-  peaks in the apogee data .",
    "times to 628 stars .",
    "the side - panels indicate the distributions over the individual variables , normalized to unit peak .",
    "the parameters for the fit to the mid - plane apogee stack are indicated by the filled red circle . in the side panels ,",
    "the vertical dashed red lines indicate the values of @xmath69 and @xmath76 for the mid - plane stack . ]",
    "a simple estimate for the nuclear disk mass can be obtained from the fraction of stars in the high-  component of the double - gaussian fit to the mid - plane losvd .",
    "if we conservatively assume that the nuclear disk mass contained within @xmath77 and @xmath78 is @xmath79 of the total mass of the besanon galaxy model @xcite within this volume we obtain a lower limit to the mass of the nuclear disk @xmath80 .",
    "attempts to explain the high-  peak directly via collisionless bar simulations fails @xcite . however @xcite demonstrated that resonant , bar - supporting 2:1 x1 ( with some mixture of higher order resonance ) orbits by themselves can produce second peaks .",
    "subsequently @xcite argued that the selection function of apogee favors young stars recently trapped into resonant orbits .",
    "their interpretation requires that the stars in the high-  peaks are younger .",
    "the other main 2:1 resonant orbit family of bars , the x2 family , is orientated perpendicular to the bar .",
    "this family is generally very poorly populated in the absence of gas @xcite , but when gas is present it is driven inwards by the bar and settles into x2 orbits @xcite .",
    "the gas can then form stars and produce nuclear rings and disks .",
    "we propose that the high-  peak corresponds to a kiloparsec - scale disk composed of stars on x2 orbits .",
    "these orbits are stable and therefore our model does not require that the stars in the high-  peak are young .",
    "nuclear disks are known in many external galaxies @xcite ; the presence of one in the mw is therefore not unusual . nor is the kiloparsec scale unusual as a fraction of the bar size .",
    "for instance in ngc  3945 the ratio of semi - major axes of the nuclear disk to bar is @xmath81 @xcite , whereas for the mw this ratio is @xmath82 , if we adopt @xcite s @xmath29 bar .",
    "the gas ring in the simulation is @xmath83 larger than the mw s cmz , which is coincident with a stellar disk @xcite .",
    "the large size of the gas ring in the model is a consequence of the still low resolution ( @xmath84 ) of our simulation @xcite .",
    "this difference implies that the nuclear disk in the mw is not currently forming stars across its full extent .                                                                                            v.",
