    "<S> the frs - esr facility at gsi provides unique conditions for precision measurements of large areas on the nuclear mass surface in a single experiment . </S>",
    "<S> values for masses of 604 neutron - deficient nuclides ( 30@xmath0z@xmath092 ) were obtained with a typical uncertainty of 30  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of 114 nuclides were determined for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the odd - even staggering ( oes ) of nuclear masses was systematically investigated for isotopic chains between the proton shell closures at z=50 and z=82 . </S>",
    "<S> the results were compared with predictions of modern nuclear models . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison revealed that the measured trend of oes is not reproduced by the theories fitted to masses only . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral pairing gaps extracted from models adjusted to both masses and density related observables of nuclei agree better with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> significant progress has been achieved over the last years in constructing self - consistent mass models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models aim to reliably describe the properties of nuclei far off the valley of @xmath2-stability , where the experimental information is scarce or even not available yet . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in modelling the astrophysical r - process of nuclear synthesis one needs precise knowledge of masses and half - lives of very exotic nuclei and one has to rely on theoretical predictions since most of the nuclides involved have not even been produced in the laboratory yet . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for these nuclides dramatically deviate for the different models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus new experimental data on exotic nuclei and consequently better understanding of nuclear structure away from the valley of @xmath2-stability is essential for further theoretical development .    </S>",
    "<S> odd - even staggering of nuclear binding energies ( oes ) was detected in the early days of nuclear physics  @xcite and was explained by the presence of pairing correlations between nucleons in the nucleus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pairing contributes only little to the total nuclear binding energy but its influence on the nuclear structure is significant .    </S>",
    "<S> the common way to extract experimental information about the pairing correlations is to measure the value of the oes which approximates the pairing - gap energy ( @xmath3 ) in the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantity is connected with the strength of the pairing interaction ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the single - particle energy and @xmath7 is the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the summation goes over all single - particle levels @xmath8 below and above the fermi energy . in order to evaluate this sum in local pairing functionals a ( smooth ) cut - off in energy </S>",
    "<S> is usually implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> neutron ( @xmath9 ) and proton ( @xmath10 ) pairing gaps are usually determined from finite - difference equations of measured masses @xcite , e.g. by the five - point formulae : @xmath11 , \\label{delta5n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 , \\label{delta5p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where m(z , n ) is the mass of an atom with z protons and n neutrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the well - known parametrization @xmath13  mev  @xcite ( @xmath14 ) provides the average trend for nuclei close to stability . </S>",
    "<S> a dependence of the pairing strength on the neutron excess was suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was later observed from the mass determination of exotic dy - hg isotopes that @xmath10 and possibly @xmath9 increase towards the proton drip - line @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present new results on the oes obtained from our high - precision mass measurements compared with predictions of modern nuclear theories .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment for direct mass measurements was performed at the frs - esr facility as continuation of a successful scientific program addressing basic nuclear properties of stored exotic nuclides  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exotic nuclei were produced by projectile fragmentation of a ( 600 - 900 )  mev / u @xmath15bi primary beam in ( 4 - 8 )  g/@xmath16 beryllium targets placed at the entrance of the fragment separator ( frs )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fragments were spatially separated in - flight and injected into the cooler - storage ring esr  @xcite . in the esr , the velocity spread of the stored fragments was reduced by electron cooling to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition provides an unambiguous relation between the revolution frequencies of the ions and their mass - to - charge ratios which is the basis for schottky mass spectrometry ( sms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time required for the electron cooling was about 10  s , which constrains the range of nuclides that might be investigated by this method . </S>",
    "<S> the sms has reached the ultimate sensitivity by recording single ions stored in the esr leading to a mass resolving power of more than 2@xmath1810@xmath19 ( fwhm ) @xcite .    in this new experiment with sms , </S>",
    "<S> 582 different nuclides were observed in the frequency spectra . from this set of nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> 117 were used for calibration . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved mass accuracy was typically 30  @xmath1 which represents an improvement by a factor of three compared to our former experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the masses of 139 nuclides were determined indirectly by means of known decay energies ( @xmath20 , @xmath2 , or proton emission ) . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of 114 nuclides were obtained for the first time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured masses cover a large area of neutron - deficient nuclides from krypton to uranium . </S>",
    "<S> all _ directly measured _ values ( see @xcite ) have been included in the latest atomic mass evaluation  @xcite .    the achieved experimental mass accuracy has allowed us to perform new systematical studies on nuclear pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the new data were combined with the data of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and precise values of oes for _ all _ even - z isotopic chains in the region between the z=50 and z=82 closed shells were extracted . </S>",
    "<S> only even - even nuclei were considered . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained show that indeed the values of oes for both the protons and the neutrons increase towards the proton drip - line , thus confirming earlier observations for a small number of nuclides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ moreover , this is a general trend for all even - z isotopic chains from tin to lead . _ </S>",
    "<S> the tin , tellurium , mercury , and lead isotopes were not considered for protons since the closed shells at z=50 and z=82 have strong influence . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the nuclides with n=80 , 82 , 84 , 124 , 126 , and 128 were excluded for neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to note that no such general trend of the oes was observed for isotopes below tin . for isotopes above </S>",
    "<S> lead the experimental information is still too scarce to draw a definite conclusion . </S>",

    "<S> note that the constants ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) converge to the same values , which is quite remarkable since this was not a constraint demanded in the analysis . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath31 value for the prediction of nuclear binding energies between z=50 and z=82 closed shells has improved by about 25  % .    </S>",
    "<S> going to microscopic models , pairing - gap energies were calculated from predictions of nuclear mass calculations of several self - consistent mass models , which are skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) calculations plus pairing treated in the bcs ( hf+bcs ) formalism ( msk7 force ) @xcite and three models where pairing is treated with the bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach with different pairing cut - off parameterizations ( bsk1 , bsk2 ) and including density - dependent pairing ( bsk3 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results calculated with 4th - order mass differences ( eqs .  [ delta5n],[delta5p ] ) are presented for even hafnium isotopes in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pair ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the general trend is _ not _ reproduced by any of the models . a comparison with four other recent hfb models where the implementation of different effective masses , with and without density - dependent pairing ( bsk4-bsk7 )  @xcite , showed similar results as those of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pair ] .    </S>",
    "<S> another branch of self - consisistent mean - field models are relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models employing finite - range meson fields ( fr ) or point couplings ( pc ) . for this study , we employed three of the best parameterizations available , namely nl - z2  @xcite and nl3  @xcite for the finite range variant , and pc - f1  @xcite for the point - coupling model . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the mass models described above , these rmf forces are adjusted to both energy and form - factor related observables ( e.g. rms radii , diffraction radii , surface thicknesses , etc . ) , and are meant to describe both kinds of observables . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we performed calculations with the shf forces ski3 and ski4 @xcite with extended spin - orbit terms , which  similar to the rmf forces  have been adjusted to both masses and density related observables . in both the rmf and the shf models , we employ bcs pairing with a density - independent @xmath32-force . as a first approach , </S>",
    "<S> the pairing gaps have been estimated from the single - particle spectrum with _ </S>",
    "<S> uv_-weighted single - particle gaps @xcite ( @xmath33 are the occupation probabilities ) , which circumvents the uncertainties related to the calculation of odd - even systems . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities constitute a measure of the pairing contribution to the oes . as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , these results need to be carefully interpreted due to polarization effects and the non - pairing - type contributions to the oes .    </S>",
    "<S> it is striking that the rmf and shf calculations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rmf ] give very similar results : the general trend of the rising pairing - gap energies is reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , some local discrepancies are observed , as e.g. close to @xmath34=5 , which can be related to the n=82 closed shell . </S>",
    "<S> although the models in fig .  [ pair ] in general have much higher predictive power for the nuclear masses @xcite the difference in the description of the experimental oes data is obvious . </S>",
    "<S> this result has not been expected and demonstrates the need for a better understanding of both the roles of the various observables and adjustment protocols as well as the procedure of calculating oes within these frameworks .    </S>",
    "<S> all models tested in this letter take into account the nuclear deformation which is essential here since most of the nuclei investigated are deformed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the observed general trend of oes has the same slope and magnitude for nearly all isotopic chains from xenon to platinum . </S>",
    "<S> use of the 2nd , 3rd , or 4th - order mass differences to disentangle the mean field contributions to the oes and pairing - gap energies has been intensively discussed in the literature  . our overall conclusions , </S>",
    "<S> as checked in different analyses , are not changed if 3 , 4 , or 5-mass formulae are used . since the mass number changes within an isotopic chain </S>",
    "<S> , volume effects might contribute to the observed isospin dependence of the oes .    with the new data available , it became possible to examine the oes predictions of different theories . </S>",
    "<S> the new results are helpful for a better description of the pairing in exotic nuclei , which is mandatory for a _ </S>",
    "<S> reliable _ theory .    </S>",
    "<S> an important future aspect is whether the observed trend of the pairing - gap energies persists for nuclides with even greater neutron excess . </S>",
    "<S> a recent experiment has been performed at the frs - esr to measure masses in the yb - pb region on the neutron - rich side of the chart of nuclides . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of very exotic neutron - rich nuclides , which can not be produced with the present facility , are foreseen within the fair project @xcite . </S>"
