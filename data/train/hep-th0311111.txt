    "the recently discovered cosmic acceleration @xcite has put forward the problem of unravelling the nature of the so called dark energy responsible for such phenomenon ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the crucial feature of the dark energy which ensures an accelerated expansion of the universe is that it breaks the strong energy condition .",
    "the tachyon field arising in the context of string theory @xcite provides one example of matter which does the job .",
    "the tachyon has been intensively studied during the last few years also in application to cosmology @xcite@xcite ; in this case one usually takes sen s effective action @xcite for granted and studies its cosmological consequences without worrying about the string - theoretical origin of the action itself .",
    "we take this attitude in the present paper .    however , it would be reasonable , before considering concrete tachyon cosmological models , to answer a simple question : is the tachyon field of real interest for cosmology ? indeed , it is well - known that for isotropic cosmological models , for a given dependence of the cosmological radius on time it is always possible to construct a potential for a minimally coupled scalar field ( in brief : scalar field ) model , which would reproduce this cosmological evolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) , provided rather general reasonable conditions are satisfied .",
    "since a similar statement holds also for cosmological models with tachyons , one can find some kind of correspondence between minimally coupled scalar field models and tachyon ones describing the same cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises : does it make sense at all to study tachyon cosmological models in place of the traditional scalar field models ?    in our opinion ,",
    "the point is that the correspondence between tachyon and scalar field cosmological models is a rather limited one and amounts to the existence of `` corresponding '' solutions of the models , obtained by imposing certain special initial conditions .",
    "if one moves away from these conditions the dynamics of the tachyon model can become more complicated and very different from that of its scalar field cousin .",
    "in this paper we consider some examples of scalar and tachyon field isotropic cosmological models having coincident exact solutions .",
    "all the exact solutions considered here actually arise as solutions of some isotropic perfect fluid cosmological models .",
    "some of the tachyon and scalar field potentials that we consider here are well known in the literature and are widely used as quintessential models",
    ". we will introduce also a new ( at least to our knowledge ) tachyon model that is based on the cosmic evolution driven by the mixture of a cosmological constant and of a fluid with equation of state @xmath1 , with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote as usual the energy density and the pressure respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding tachyon potential @xmath5 is represented by a rather cumbersome trigonometric function of the tachyon field .",
    "when the parameter @xmath6 is positive the potential becomes imaginary passing through zero for finite values of the tachyon field @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it might seem that these features would kill the model ; on the contrary , using the methods of the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations , it is possible to extract from the model a dynamics which is perfectly meaningful also for positive @xmath6 .",
    "we find that this dynamics is quite rich .",
    "in particular , when the value of the parameter @xmath6 is positive , the model possesses two types of trajectories : trajectories describing an eternally expanding universe and those hitting a cosmological singularity of a special type that we have chosen to call a _",
    "big brake_. thus , starting with a simple perfect fluid model and trying to reproduce its cosmological evolution in scalar field and tachyon models , we arrive to a relatively simple scalar field potential with a correspondingly simple dynamics and to a complicated tachyon potential .",
    "the latter provides us with a model having a very interesting dynamics giving rise to very different cosmological evolutions and opening in turn opportunities for some non - trivial speculations about the future of the universe .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the second section we study the problem of the correspondence between tachyon and scalar field cosmological models and give some examples in the third section . in the fourth section",
    "we suggest a way to go beyond the limitations of tachyonic models and we make use of this idea in the fifth and sixth sections where we study the dynamics and the cosmology of a particular ( toy ) tachyon model introduced in sec .",
    "3 . in the last section",
    "we conclude our paper by some speculations on the future evolution of the universe arising from the analysis of our model .",
    "we consider a flat friedmann cosmological model @xmath8 of a universe filled with some perfect fluid and suppose that the cosmological evolution @xmath9 is given ; the friedmann equation @xmath10 provides the dependence @xmath11 of the energy density of the fluid on the cosmic time ( we have put @xmath12 for convenience )",
    ". then , the equation for energy conservation @xmath13 fixes the pressure @xmath14 ; therefore an equation of state @xmath15 can in principle be written describing the unique fluid model compatible with the given cosmic evolution ( provided that @xmath16 ) .",
    "now , let us suppose that the matter content of the universe is modeled by a homogeneous tachyon field @xmath17 described by sen s lagrangian density @xcite : @xmath18 the energy momentum tensor is diagonal and the corresponding field - dependent energy density and pressure are given by @xmath19 @xmath20 while the field equation for the tachyon is written as follows @xmath21 one can try and find a potential @xmath5 so that , for certain suitably chosen initial conditions on the tachyon field , the scale factor of the universe is precisely the given @xmath22 .",
    "a similar construction can be attempted for a minimally coupled scalar field , described by the lagrangian density @xmath23 a given cosmological evolution @xmath24 can therefore be used to establish a sort of correspondence between the two potentials @xmath5 and @xmath25 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us see in some detail how this works and what the sought correspondence really means .",
    "it is often more practical to use the scale factor @xmath26 to parameterize the cosmic time ; this can be done provided @xmath27 . from eqs .",
    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) it follows that @xmath28 by using eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann1 ] ) and ( [ en - cons ] ) the latter equation can be rewritten as follows @xmath29 where `` prime '' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "once @xmath22 and therefore @xmath30 is specified ( see eq .",
    "( [ friedmann1 ] ) ) , eq .",
    "( [ tdef ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath31 ( an arbitrary additive integration constant is hidden in the unspecified integration limit ) . by inverting eq.([phidef ] )",
    "@xmath32 and making use of the relation @xmath33 the shape of the required tachyon potential @xmath34 can be found .    for the minimally coupled scalar field we have similar formulas .",
    "the analogs of eqs .",
    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) for the scalar field are @xmath35 @xmath36 from these we get @xmath37 and @xmath38 integration of eq .",
    "( [ sdef ] ) gives @xmath39 and as before @xmath40 .",
    "the formulas above establish a kind of correspondence between the potentials @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the sense that the cosmologies resulting from such potentials admit the given cosmological evolution @xmath24 for suitably chosen initial conditions on the fields .",
    "however , it has to be stressed that for arbitrary initial conditions on the fields the cosmological evolutions ( within the corresponding models ) may be drastically different .",
    "furthermore , changing the initial conditions , say , for a minimally coupled scalar field theory , one gets different cosmological evolutions which , in turn , can be reproduced in entirely different tachyon theories and viceversa .",
    "thus , any scalar field potential has a whole ( one - parameter ) family of corresponding tachyon potentials and the same is true the other way around .",
    "we can learn something more by expressing the fields @xmath7 and @xmath43 and the potentials @xmath5 and @xmath25 in terms of the hubble variable @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath45 one has easily that @xmath46 and that @xmath47 eqs .",
    "( [ vpot ] ) and ( [ upot ] ) call for the condition @xmath48 or equivalently @xmath49 . for the tachyon model eq .",
    "( [ vpot ] ) requires the additional condition @xmath50 which is equivalent to ask for a negative pressure @xmath51 .",
    "it seems therefore that tachyonic models are more restrictive than minimally coupled scalar fields in their possibility to describe cosmological evolutions .",
    "we will see in an example that this seemingly negative conclusion can be overcome and pleasant surprises may arise .",
    "we now illustrate the above considerations by means of some explicitly solvable examples . in these examples we assume , as usual , that the initial moment of time , @xmath52 , corresponds to the cosmological singularity .",
    "all these examples are based on simple models of perfect fluids as specified by their equations of state .    1 .",
    "the starting point of the first example is a model of universe filled with a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath53 , with @xmath2 ; the hubble variable of this model is given by @xmath54 a minimally coupled scalar field theory that produces the same evolution @xmath55 for suitably chosen initial conditions can be based on one of the following scalar potentials , which are obtained by the procedure outlined in the previous section : @xmath56 the limiting case @xmath57 gives a minimally coupled massless field .",
    "for @xmath58 the potential becomes negative reflecting the fact that the velocity of sound is bigger than the speed of light . + both choices of sign in the exponent are acceptable and the normalization of the potentials can be chosen arbitrarily ( the constant @xmath59 ) ; then , the exact solutions of the field equations providing the prescribed cosmological evolution ( [ hubblemod1 ] ) are , respectively , the following : @xmath60 the theories are obviously connected by the symmetry operation @xmath61 , which exchanges the potentials and the corresponding solutions . + to construct a tachyonic field theory we have to restrict our attention to the case @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "following the same procedure we get a tachyon field model , based on the potential @xmath64 there are again two exact solutions of the field equations ( [ hubblemod1 ] ) , which now do co - exist within the same model : @xmath65 + this tachyonic model has been studied in @xcite , where also the correspondence with a minimally coupled scalar field theory with exponential potential was noticed .",
    "there exists a vast literature on the latter ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "now we add a positive cosmological constant to the previous model , i.e. we consider the mixture @xmath66 this is the same as one fluid with state equation @xmath67 the evolution of the hubble variable is now given by @xmath68 the corresponding minimally coupled scalar field theory is based on the following potential : @xmath69 there are two exact solutions of the field equations reproducing the given cosmic evolution ( [ hubblemod2 ] ) : @xmath70 to find the tachyonic model we observe first of all that to have the restriction @xmath62 satisfied it is sufficient to require that @xmath71 ; this condition is also necessary if one demands that @xmath62 during all the stages of the cosmological evolution and for any choice of the initial conditions in the tachyonic model . with this condition",
    "we obtain the following more complicated tachyon potential : @xmath72 } \\sqrt{1 - ( 1+k ) \\cos^2\\left[\\frac{3}{2}{\\sqrt{\\lambda\\,(1+k)}\\,(t - t_0)}\\right]}. \\label{v2}\\ ] ] still , the corresponding exact solutions can be found and are given by @xmath73 for @xmath74 there are values of the tachyon field for which the potential ( [ v2 ] ) becomes imaginary passing through zero .",
    "+ when @xmath75 tends to zero one expects to recover the model studied in the first example .",
    "this is indeed the case for the tachyonic field . + as for the scalar potential ( [ u2 ] ) the situation is a bit trickier : the correct limit can be obtained only by letting the constant @xmath59 vary with @xmath75 as follows : @xmath76 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the corresponding examples .",
    "this is because the theory has a symmetry which is lost in the limit . +",
    "notice that the scalar field potential ( [ u2 ] ) is well - defined at @xmath77 and the model possesses the exact solution ( [ incond6 ] ) which corresponds to the cosmological evolution ( [ hubblemod2 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the universe within the tachyonic models ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) will be studied in detail in the next sections for general initial conditions .",
    "we shall show that both models can be extended to the interval @xmath78 , actually making them richer than the corresponding scalar minimally coupled theories .",
    "+ 3 .   in the third example we consider a perfect fluid whose equation of state is as follows : @xmath79 in this case the hubble variable is @xmath80the scalar potential has the form @xmath81 the exact solutions are @xmath82",
    "the tachyon potential is @xmath83 with the following exact solutions : @xmath84 + the scalar field model with the potential ( [ u3 ] ) was studied in @xcite while the corresponding tachyon model with the potential ( [ v3 ] ) was discussed in @xcite .",
    "in our last example we consider the chaplygin gas , described by the following equation of state : @xmath85 in this example the evolution @xmath55 is given only implicitly @xcite by the formula : @xmath86 however , as shown in @xcite , the scalar potential can be reconstructed using the known explicit dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath26 and one gets @xmath87 the corresponding field configuration is also given implicitly : @xmath88 similarly , using the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath26 one can reconstruct the tachyon potential : @xmath89 it is easy to see @xcite that the tachyon model with a constant potential is exactly equivalent to the chaplygin gas model . indeed , in the case of a constant tachyon potential the relation between the tachyon energy density ( [ energy ] ) and the pressure ( [ pressure ] ) is just that of the chaplygin gas ( [ model4 ] ) , where @xmath90 .",
    "the chaplygin gas cosmological model was introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite and many other papers .",
    "comparison with observational data has also been extensively performed @xcite .",
    "we now take a step back and consider the problem of finding a tachyonic field theory admitting the same cosmic evolution as the one produced by perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath91 , where now @xmath92 .",
    "as we have stated , it is impossible to reproduce this dynamics using sen s tachyonic action ( [ tachyon ] ) .",
    "one way out is to introduce a new field theory based on a born - infeld type action with lagrangian @xmath93 in this new field theory the energy and pressure are given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 the pressure ( if well defined ) is now positive . on the other side ,",
    "the equation of motion for this field has exactly the same form ( [ tac - eq ] ) that was derived by sen s action .    following the procedure described in section 2 ,",
    "now applied to the lagrangian ( [ lagn ] ) , one gets the following potential corresponding to the equation of state @xmath91 ( with @xmath96 : @xmath97 the exact solution of the field equations that reproduces the dynamics of the perfect fluid is @xmath98 ( we restrict our attention to the region of the phase space where @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "there are two other obvious solutions for this model , corresponding to other choices of the initial conditions ; they also give rise to linearly growing fields : @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we would like to point out an interesting fact : the lagrangian ( [ lagn ] ) which , together with the explicit form ( [ potn ] ) of the potential , describes the field theory corresponding to a positive value of @xmath6 , is actually the same as sen s lagrangian ( [ tachyon ] ) with potential ( [ v1 ] ) itself considered for positive @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , it is true on the one hand that in this case the potential ( [ v1 ] ) becomes imaginary .",
    "however , this can be compensated by considering the kinetic term in the region @xmath103 so that the action as whole remains real .",
    "it can be re - interpreted as the product of two real terms : @xmath104 this model is introduced here as a pedagogical introduction to the model with the potential ( [ v2 ] ) , which we discuss in detail in the following section .",
    "the properties of the present model can be recovered in the limit @xmath105 and we will not further comment on it .",
    "we now provide the analysis of the dynamics of the tachyonic model based on the potential ( [ v2 ] ) . in this case",
    "( [ tac - eq ] ) is equivalent to the following system of two first - order differential equations @xmath106 where using the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann1 ] ) we have expressed the hubble variable @xmath107 as a function of the variables @xmath7 and @xmath108 .",
    "the model has the following two exact solutions ( we take @xmath109 without loss of generality ) : @xmath110 by inserting ( [ v2 ] ) into ( [ eq2 ] ) and by eliminating the time we obtain an equation for the phase space trajectories @xmath111 : @xmath112 in the phase plane @xmath113 the solutions ( [ solution ] ) ( [ solution1 ] ) correspond to arcs of the curve @xmath0 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) : @xmath114 the behavior of the cosmological radius for both solutions ( [ solution ] ) and ( [ solution1 ] ) is the following : @xmath115 as expected , we get back the cosmological evolution ( [ hubblemod2 ] ) determined by the equation of state ( [ model21 ] ) which was the starting point for constructing the potential ( [ v2 ] ) . to study the cosmological evolutions corresponding to all possible initial conditions we need to distinguish two different cases .",
    "when the parameter @xmath116 there are no surprises and the associated cosmology is essentially driven by that of the exact solutions while when @xmath6 is positive the model seems at first to be ill - defined .",
    "we will have again to go beyond the model itself and `` transgress the boundaries '' to see what its possible meaning can be .    in the first case when @xmath117 the potential ( [ v2 ] ) is well - defined for @xmath118 while the dynamics guarantees that @xmath119 the system has only one critical point , namely @xmath120 the eigenvalues of the linearized system in the neighborhood of this point are @xmath121 both of them are real and negative .",
    "thus , this special point is an attractive node .",

    "the curve @xmath0 corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath123 , whose absolute value is the smallest of the two .",
    "it acts as a separatrix for the integral curves .",

    "therefore , from each point @xmath159 there originates only one integral curve behaving as ( [ sol - as3 ] ) .",

    "the `` physical '' reason for this behavior is the vanishing of the potential at @xmath185 ( to our knowledge this is a novel feature of our model ) ; indeed , the structure of the tachyonic action implies that the `` force '' is proportional to the logarithmic derivative of the potential and this is infinite at @xmath185 .",

    "indeed , one can see by inspection that the field equations are well defined also inside the four semi - infinite strips defined by the following inequalities : @xmath233 , with @xmath234 or @xmath235 ; @xmath236 with @xmath234 or @xmath235 .",
    "then , following the strategy sketched in section [ sect4 ] , we introduce a `` new '' lagrangian : @xmath237 where the `` new '' potential is given by @xmath238 the `` new '' lagrangian comes itself out of sen s action ( eqs . ( [ tachyon]),([v2 ] ) ) by the previous trick : @xmath239 i.e. both the `` old '' kinetic term and the potential become imaginary but",
    "their product remains real .",
    "it follows from the dynamics ( [ eq5 ] ) that the expressions under the square root in the potential and the kinetic term change sign simultaneously .",
    "in other words , in the phase diagram no trajectory can cross any side of the rectangle .",
    "thus , all the quantities characterizing the model keep real during the dynamical evolution .",
    "white regions in the phase diagram , where the lagrangian and other quantities would become imaginary , are forbidden ! the product ( [ lagrange1 ] ) , which amounts exactly to the `` old '' lagrangian , can be interpreted in terms of the `` new '' kinetic term and potential that are both real .",
    "this makes it clear why the `` new '' lagrangian gives rise to field equations in the above four strips , which are the same as in the interior of the rectangle . at first glance",
    "one might have the impression that there is a freedom of choice of sign for the new lagrangian ( [ lagrange1 ] ) , or , in other words , that one may choose opposite signs in eqs . ( [ i m a ] ) , ( [ ima1 ] ) . however , this is not so : the choice of sign in eq .",
    "( [ lagrange1 ] ) is determined by the requirement of continuity of the einstein ( friedmann ) equations when passing from the rectangle to the stripes . as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] , both the energy density and the pressure are positive in the considered strips .    however , there is an important difference between the present situation and the one described in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "here we are dealing with one single model ( @xmath6 is fixed ) .",
    "one is compelled to make the extension of the model and , contrary to the @xmath240 case , the two different `` phases '' ( i.e. negative and positive pressure ) are found within the same model , at different stages of the cosmic evolution , one phase in the rectangle , the other in the strips . in the following",
    "we give the precise mathematical meaning of this extension .",
    "this opens the way to the study of a new class of tachyon field theories .",
    "we start by describing the behavior of the trajectories in the lower left strip ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath241 , the evolution along any given trajectory will lead us in a finite amount of time to either hit the vertical line @xmath138 or to approach a vertical asymptote @xmath242 , with @xmath243 .",
    "the first alternative does not take place , whereas all values of @xmath244 in the indicated range are allowed , with the exception of @xmath245 .",
    "indeed , in the vicinity of @xmath138 eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) takes the following form @xmath246 now , assume there is an @xmath247 such that @xmath248 .",

    "it follows that the line @xmath138 is not an asymptote for any trajectory but of course there are trajectories whose asymptote is as close as we like to the line @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the trajectories inside the considered strip can be parameterized by the value @xmath244 of the coordinate of their vertical asymptote .",
    "we now discuss how they behave in the neighborhood of @xmath252 . as before we can divide the trajectories inside the strip into three families according to their leading behavior @xmath253 trajectories of type ( [ fam1 ] ) fan out from point @xmath231 into the strip at all possible angles",
    ". trajectories of type ( [ fam3 ] ) can be thought of as originating from @xmath254 .",

    "the coordinate @xmath244 of the asymptote is an increasing function of @xmath160 . as @xmath257 it attains a value characterizing the asymptote of curve ( [ fam2 ] ) , beyond which it becomes an increasing function of @xmath258 .",
    "let us go back to physics and consider the behavior of the cosmological radius @xmath22 when the tachyon field @xmath17 tends to @xmath244 along the solution of the field equations .",
    "the friedmann equation implies that @xmath259 and that @xmath260 ( see eq .",
    "( [ hdot2 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the scalar curvature ( [ curvature ] ) diverges and the universe reaches a cosmological singularity in a finite time .",
    "this is an unusual type of singularity which we call _ big brake_. indeed , since @xmath261 , in a big brake we have that @xmath262    in other words , the evolution of the universe comes to a screeching halt in a finite amount of time and its ultimate scale depends on the final value @xmath244 of the tachyon field .",
    "we now turn to the behavior of the trajectories in the upper left strip . in the vicinity of @xmath138",
    "the equation for the trajectories takes the form ( [ closetosing ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath263 vanishes at the values @xmath264 as explained earlier it is only at these values of @xmath108 that the trajectories can leave the line @xmath138 .",
    "in addition , an analysis similar to the one performed earlier shows that the only trajectory starting at @xmath154 is the line @xmath162 , and that the only trajectory starting at @xmath158 is the curve @xmath0 .",
    "all other trajectories start from @xmath265 .",
    "( [ closetosing ] ) shows that as @xmath143 the derivative @xmath266 approaches @xmath267 for @xmath268 whereas it approaches @xmath269 for @xmath270 and @xmath271 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . to study the behavior in the neighborhood of @xmath272 we set @xmath273 with @xmath274 small . in the approximate equation for @xmath275",
    "it is necessary , besides the leading term , to keep the term proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "thus we get @xmath276 the general solution of this equation is @xmath277 where @xmath278 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "if @xmath279 we have the leading behavior @xmath280 therefore , if @xmath281 the trajectories start from @xmath282 with horizontal tangent , whereas they start with vertical tangent when @xmath283 .",
    "if @xmath284 they are born with any possible tangent .",
    "when @xmath285 we must go to the next order : @xmath286 this curve acts as a separatrix for the curves having positive and negative @xmath278 respectively . regarding the curves of the strip which lie below @xmath0 they depart from @xmath159 and behave in the neighborhood of this point as @xmath287 where the function @xmath255 is the same as in ( [ fam3 ] ) .",
    "regarding the behavior of the trajectories in the neighborhood of @xmath185 a simple analysis shows that they stream into @xmath202 at all possible angles ( except vertically and horizontally ) .",
    "these properties show that each curve of type ( [ point3 ] ) with positive @xmath278 attains a maximum somewhere between @xmath138 and @xmath288 whose height is an increasing function of @xmath278 which tends to infinity as @xmath289 .",
    "so far , we have analyzed the behavior of the trajectories in two distinct regions : the rectangle and the four strips .",
    "now , it has to be noted that the trajectories in the rectangle which leave @xmath202 ( or @xmath232 ) at all possible angles in the open interval @xmath290 and the trajectories which enter @xmath231 ( or @xmath213 ) , again at all possible angles , are incomplete , since the vertices of the rectangle are not cosmological singularities for these curves .",
    "the same is true for the trajectories in the strips which enter @xmath202 ( or @xmath232 ) and leave @xmath213 ( or @xmath231 ) .",
    "this circumstance , and the fact that the equation of motion for @xmath7 is the same in the rectangle and in the strips , indicates that it must be possible to extend and complete the above set of trajectories by continuation through the vertices of the rectangle . precisely , the trajectories entering @xmath202 ( or @xmath232 ) from the upper left ( or lower right ) strip shall be continued into the trajectories entering into the rectangle from @xmath202 ( or @xmath232 ) .",
    "similar remarks apply to the corners @xmath213 and @xmath231 .",
    "the uniqueness of this continuation procedure can be proved by applying the @xmath0-process method of resolution of singularities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this amounts to blowing up ( unfolding ) the vertices of the rectangle by transition to suitable projective coordinates , the use of which removes the degeneracy of the vector field at these points .",
    "we do not give the mathematical details .",
    "the rich mathematical structure that we have exhibited in the previous section gives rise to the possibility that cosmologies that have very different features coexist within the same model . in this sense tachyonic models",
    "are richer than the `` corresponding '' standard scalar field models .",
    "we now characterize all the evolutions in our model that are portrayed in fig .",
    "we start from the trajectories originating from the cosmological singularity @xmath291 and which are characterized in the neighborhood of the latter by formula ( [ point3 ] ) with the parameter @xmath278 positive and very large .",
    "one such trajectory , as soon as it leaves the singularity , raises steeply upwards until it attains some maximum value .",
    "henceforth it turns steeply downwards , enters the rectangle at @xmath202 at some small angle @xmath292 with the vertical axis @xmath180 and moves towards @xmath231 . upon reaching this point",
    "it enters the lower left strip and eventually ends up in a finite time @xmath293 in a big brake corresponding to some field value @xmath244 very close to @xmath294 ( inf @xmath295 .    as @xmath278 decreases the height of the maximum decreases accordingly , @xmath292 and @xmath293 increase and @xmath244 decreases .",
    "eventually , at some critical value @xmath296 of the parameter @xmath278 , the trajectory degenerates inside the rectangle with the separatrices @xmath214 and @xmath220 entering and , respectively , leaving the saddle point @xmath215 .",
    "the curves for which @xmath297 belong to the bundle @xmath229 .",

    "the upper bound of @xmath278 for the curves of bundle @xmath222 is @xmath296 and corresponds to the separatrix @xmath214 and @xmath218 .",
    "this means that a tiny difference in the initial conditions will end up into dramatically different evolutions : one universe goes into an accelerating expansion of the de sitter type and the other ends with a big brake .",
    "this should not be confused with a chaotic behavior : the two evolutions are almost indistinguishable for a very long time and then suddenly diverge from each other . as @xmath278 approaches",
    "@xmath267 we end up into the separatrix @xmath0 originating at the cosmological singularity @xmath158 .",
    "proceeding further we encounter those evolutions which start at @xmath159 , @xmath300 . in the neighborhood of the starting point",
    "they behave according to eq .",
    "( [ point6 ] ) , then enter the rectangle through @xmath202 passing above the curve @xmath0 from below . in the limit @xmath301",
    "we obtain the trajectory @xmath205 . as @xmath160 increases further beyond @xmath294",

    "they also end up in a big brake .",
    "the evolutions corresponding to the trajectories of the different bundles can also be studied in terms of the qualitative behavior of the hubble parameter @xmath55 as a function of time ( see fig .

    "instead , for a trajectory of bundle @xmath222 which lies very close @xmath0 the behavior @xmath340 of @xmath55 at small times is characterized by a value of the constant @xmath278 which is negative and very large ; the graph of @xmath55 parts only slightly from the graph of @xmath322 and the asymptotic value @xmath339 is approached much earlier .",

    "remark that , as one can see from fig .",
    "5 , there is nothing peculiar in the behavior of @xmath55 at the times when vertices of the rectangle are crossed .",
    "the possibility of cosmological singularities characterized by the divergence of the second time derivative of the cosmological scale factor has also been considered in @xcite in the brane cosmology context .",
    "we conclude this section by another simple example of cosmology sharing this property .",
    "let us consider the flat friedmann universe filled with a perfect fluid with a state equation similar to ( [ model4 ] ) : @xmath352 where @xmath211 is positive .",
    "we can call this fluid the `` anti - chaplygin gas '' .",
    "this equation of state arises in the study of the so - called wiggly strings @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the energy density on the cosmological radius is given by @xmath353 where @xmath199 is a positive constant . at the beginning of the cosmological evolution",
    "@xmath354 , like in the dust - dominated case . now there is a maximal value possible for the cosmological scale @xmath355 that is attained in a finite cosmic time @xmath356 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath22 in the vicinity of the maximum is the following @xmath357 since @xmath358 while @xmath359 we are back into a big brake cosmological singularity .",
    "thus , a big brake singularity can be found in an elementary cosmological model ( though based on an exotic fluid ) .",
    "the difference with the tachyonic model is that in the latter there are evolutions culminating in a big brake which co - exist with other evolutions giving rise to an infinite accelerated expansion .",
    "these two types of evolutions correspond to different classes of initial conditions .",
    "it maybe worth mentioning that also for @xmath92 one can construct a scalar field model ; indeed the potential displayed in eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) is not restricted to @xmath63 .",
    "but this model has a much poorer dynamics : all the trajectories tend to the de sitter attractive node point .",
    "the study of the fate or the future of the universe is rather popular nowadays @xcite@xcite , and , as was predicted more than 20 years ago by f.j .",
    "dyson @xcite , `` eschatology '' has now become part of the cosmological studies .",
    "this sort of studies include of course also biological aspects of and the fate of consciousness in the different cosmological scenarios ( see , for example , @xcite ) but our goal is much more modest and we shall concentrate on the purely geometrical facet of the topic .",
    "there are three mainly studied possible scenarios for the future of the universe , intensively discussed in literature : an infinite expansion ; an expansion followed by a contraction ending in a `` big crunch '' ; an infinitely bouncing or recycling universe .",
    "the present set of observational data seems to favor the first scenario : the data are quite compatible with a flat universe with a positive cosmological constant .    on the other hand a negative value of the cosmological constant fits better with string theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a small negative cosmological constant could be made compatible with the present day cosmic acceleration , provided there are some fields or types of matter responsible for this acceleration .",
    "however , in this context the cosmological radius sooner or later will start decreasing and the expansion will be followed by a contraction which would normally lead the universe to a cosmological singularity of the big crunch type .    the third scenario of an infinitely bouncing or recycling universe appears to many to be very attractive because it opens an opportunity to escape the `` frying '' in the big crunch and the `` freezing '' in the infinite expansion case . in this scenario , during the process of contraction there will be two opportunities : collapse or bounce with subsequent expansion .",
    "the choice of one of these opportunities depends on the initial conditions and this dependence has usually a chaotic character @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can show @xcite that for every model of dark energy describing an eternally expanding universe one can construct many closely related models which describe the present stage of acceleration of the universe followed by its global collapse . however , these models corresponding to eternally expanding and collapsing universes are different and have different values of their basic parameters .    one interesting feature of our toy tachyon model is that the first and the second scenario coexist in its context .",
    "depending on initial conditions , some correspond to eternal expansions of the universe which approach asymptotically a pure de sitter regime , while others end their evolution at the cosmological singularity .",
    "the second distinguishing feature of this model is that the singularity at which the universe ends its evolution is not a standard big crunch singularity .",
    "instead , it corresponds to a finite non zero cosmological radius at which the hubble parameter is finite and the deceleration parameter is infinite and has positive sign .",
    "we have called this fate `` big brake '' .",
    "the prospect of hitting the cosmological singularity during expansion has been also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the singularity corresponds to an infinite value of the hubble variable and the cosmological radius .",
    "this scenario is known as `` big rip '' or `` phantom cosmology '' ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the third distinguishing aspect of our model is the fact that the regions of the phase space corresponding to different types of trajectories are well separated and the dependence of the cosmology on the choice of initial conditions is quite regular ( non chaotic ) .",
    "a remark is in order here : the chaoticity of the classical dynamics hinders the application of the wkb approximation and , hence , undermines the basis of the majority of results of quantum cosmology @xcite . in our model",
    "quantum- cosmological schemes of the traditional type @xcite can be attempted .",
    "the corresponding wave function should describe a probability distribution over different initial conditions for the classical evolution of the universe .",
    "the quantum evolution of the universe in our toy model might be expressed in the language of the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this framework",
    "one can say that the wave function of the universe describes the quantum birth of the universe and subsequently the process of the so called `` classicalization '' ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . during this process",
    "the wave function splits into different branches or everett worlds corresponding to different possible classical histories of the universe .",
    "the peculiarity of our toy model consists in the fact that some of these branches describe eternally expanding universes while other branches correspond to universes which end their evolution hitting the cosmological singularity .",
