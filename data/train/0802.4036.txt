    "smectic elastomers  @xcite are rubbery materials with the orientational properties of smectic liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "they possess a plane - like , lamellar modulation of density in one direction . in the smectic-@xmath0 ( sm@xmath0 ) phase ,",
    "the frank director @xmath2 describing the average orientation of constituent mesogens is parallel to the normal @xmath3 of the smectic layers whereas in the smectic-@xmath1 ( sm@xmath1 ) phase , there is a non - zero tilt - angle @xmath4 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "recently , there has been some controversy about whether shear strain and tilt of the director relative to the layer normal are coupled in smectic elastomers and whether the imposition of one necessarily leads to the development of the other .",
    "beautiful experiments by nishikawa and finkelmann  @xcite , where a sm@xmath0 elastomer was subjected to extensional strain along the layer normal , found a drastic decrease in young s modulus at a threshold strain of about @xmath5 accompanied by a rotation of @xmath3 through an angle @xmath6 that sets in at the same threshold . interpreting their x - ray data",
    ", the authors concluded that there was no sm@xmath1-like order over the range of strains they probed , and that the reduction in young s modulus stems from a partial breakdown of smectic layering .",
    "recently , adams and warner ( aw )  @xcite developed a model for sm@xmath0 elastomers which assumes that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are rigidly locked such that @xmath7 . this model produces a stress - strain curve and a curve for the rotation angle @xmath6 of @xmath3 in full agreement with the experimental curves but without needing to invoke a breakdown of smectic layering .",
    "evidently , because of the assumption @xmath7 , the aw model predicts no sm@xmath1-like order .",
    "more recently , stenull and lubensky  @xcite argued that shear strain and sm@xmath1-like order are coupled and that the imposition of one inevitably leads to the development of the other .",
    "they developed a model based on lagrangian elasticity that predicts , as does the aw model , a stress - strain curve and a curve for @xmath6 in full agreement with the experiment .",
    "in contrast to the interpretation of nishikawa and finkelmann of their data and to the central assumption of the aw model , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the tilt angle @xmath8 of @xmath2 is not identical to that of the layer normal , @xmath6 , implying that there is sm@xmath1-like order with non - zero @xmath4 above the threshold strain .",
    "however , estimates of @xmath6 and @xmath8 based on reasonable assumptions guided by the available experimental data of the layer normal - director coupling , turn out the same order of magnitude .",
    "the upshot is that ref .",
    "@xcite predicts sm@xmath1-like tilt above the threshold strain but that the angle @xmath4 is small .",
    "it is entirely possible that @xmath4 is smaller than the resolution of the experiments by nishikawa and finkelmann . in this case",

    "@xcite and the experimental data by nishikawa and finkelmann .",
    "the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite imply in particular that a sm@xmath0 elastomer subjected to a shear in the plane containing @xmath3 will develop sm@xmath1-like tilt of the director .",
    "very recently , kramer and finkelmann ( kf )  @xcite performed corresponding shear experiments using two different shear geometries .",
    "one geometry , which we refer to as tilt geometry , imposes a shear that is accompanied by an effective compression of the sample along the layer normal . in this geometry ,",
    "the elastomer ruptures at an imposed mechanical shear angle @xmath9 of @xmath10  @xcite or @xmath11  @xcite , and up to these values of @xmath9 no sm@xmath1-like tilt is detected within the accuracy of the experiments of about @xmath12 , as was the case in the earlier stretching experiments of nishikawa and finkelmann .",
    "the other shear geometry , which we refer to as slider geometry , imposes simple shear and can be used to probe values of @xmath9 exceeding @xmath13 . for this geometry ,",
    "the kf x - ray data provides clear evidence for the emergence of sm@xmath1-like tilt .    in this communication",
    ", we generalize the model introduced by aw  @xcite and use it to study the magnitude of sm@xmath1-like tilt under shear for the two geometries investigated by kf . using reasonable estimates of model parameters , we estimate the tilt angle @xmath4 , and we compare our estimates to the experimental results .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this communication is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : extendingaw ] we develop our model , which generalizes the original aw model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expgeomtiltang ] we describe the two experimental setups that we consider .",
    "we discuss the respective deformation tensors for these setups and calculate for both setups the sm@xmath1-tilt angle @xmath4 as a function of the imposed mechanical tilt angle @xmath9 .",
    "we address why the tilter apparatus is problematic for experiments where shear induces director tilt . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss our findings and we make some concluding comments .",
    "there are two appendices . in app .",
    "[ app : smallangles ] , we comment on analytical calculations of @xmath4 for small @xmath9 . in app .",
    "[ app : euler ] , we briefly discuss the euler instability in the context of the experiments by kf .",
    "in this section we devise a theory for smectic elastomers based on the _ neo - classical _ approach , developed originally by warner and terentjev and coworkers  @xcite for nematic elastomers , and the subsequent extension of the _ neo - classical _ approach by aw to smectics .",
    "the _ neo - classical _ approach generalizes the classical theory of rubber elasticity  @xcite to include the effects of orientational anisotropy on the random walks of constituent polymer links .",
    "it treats large strains with the same ease as they are treated in rubbers in the absence of orientational order , it provides direct estimates of the magnitudes of elastic energies , it is characterized by a small number of parameters , and it accounts easily for incompressibility .    in the _ neo - classical _ approach ,",
    "one formulates elastic energy densities in terms of the cauchy deformation tensor @xmath14 , defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the target space vector that measures the position in the deformed medium of a mass point that was at position @xmath17 in the undeformed reference medium . in this approach ,",
    "a generic model elastic energy density for smectic elastomers that allows for a relative tilt between the director and the layer normal can be written in the form @xmath18 here and in the following , incompressibility of the material is assumed , i.e. , the deformation tensor is subject to the constraint @xmath19 .",

    ", we include the semisoft term @xcite @xmath38    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the relation of the model presented here to the aw model is the following : aw assume that the layer normal and the director are rigidly locked such that the angle @xmath4 is constrained to zero .",
    "moreover , the semi - soft term @xmath37 is absent in the aw model .",
    "essentially , we retrieve the aw model from eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_f ] ) by setting @xmath40 ( or equivalently @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 .",
    "as mentioned above , one of the virtues of the _ neo - classical _ approach is that it involves only a few parameters , and for most of these there exist experimental estimates , which we will now review briefly .",
    "the shear modulus @xmath21 for rubbery materials is typically of the order of @xmath43 .",
    "a typical value for the smectic layer compression modulus in smectic elastomers , as observed in experiments with small strains along the layer normal , is @xmath44 , which is greater than the values in liquid smectics . in previous experiments by the freiburg group ,",
    "the anisotropy ratio was approximately @xmath45  @xcite , and we adopt this value for our arguments here .",
    "the value of @xmath46 can be estimated from experiments by brehmer , zentel , gieselmann , germer and zungenmaier   on smectic elastomers and by archer and dierking  @xcite on liquid smectics .",
    "the former experiment indicates that @xmath46 is of the order of @xmath47 at room - temperature , and the latter experiment produces a room - temperature value of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "we are not aware of any experimental data that allows us to estimate @xmath39 for smectic elastomers reliably . for nematic elastomers",
    ", it has been estimated from the fredericks effect  @xcite and from the magnitude of the threshold to director rotation in response to stretches applied perpendicular to the original director  @xcite that @xmath49 or @xmath50 , respectively . for our arguments here , we adopt the latter value acknowledging that @xmath39 may be considerably larger in smectics than in nematics . as we will see in the following , our findings do not depend sensitively on this assumption .",
    "for the deformations that we consider , @xmath39 appears only in the combination @xmath51 , that is , semi - softness simply adds to the director - layer normal coupling .",
    "uncertainty in estimates for @xmath52 is expected stem mainly from the spread in estimates for @xmath46",
    ". we account for this spread by discussing several values of @xmath52 or , more precisely , for several values of @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we apply the model defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : extendingaw ] to study the behavior of sm@xmath0 elastomers in shear experiments .",
    "we consider two experimental setups . in the first setup , which is perhaps the first that comes to mind from a physicist s viewpoint , a simple shear is applied , i.e. , a shear strain in which the externally imposed displacements all lie in a single direction .",
    "figure  [ fig : sliderapparatus ] shows a sketch of such an experiment , and we call the apparatus sketched in it the slider apparatus .    -direction remains fixed.,width=226 ]    the second setup , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltapparatus ] , is one in which opposing surfaces of the sample remain essentially parallel but in which the height of the sample ( its extension in the @xmath54-direction ) decreases upon shearing .",
    "hence , the applied shear is , strictly speaking , not just simple shear . in the following",
    "we will refer to the this apparatus as a tilt apparatus .          to make our arguments to follow as concrete and simple as possible , we now choose a specific coordinate system .",
    "that is , we choose our @xmath54 direction along the uniaxial direction @xmath24 of the unsheared samples , @xmath55 , and we choose our @xmath56 direction as the direction along which the sample is clamped , which is perpendicular to @xmath24 , cf .",
    "[ fig : sliderapparatus ] . with these coordinates , the deformation tensor for both the slider apparatus and",
    "the tilt apparatus is of the form @xmath57 as can be easily checked , for this type of deformation , the layer normal lies along the @xmath54-direction for the unsheared _ and _ for the sheared samples .",
    "thus , the tilt angle @xmath4 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is identical to the tilt angle between @xmath2 and the @xmath54-axis , and we can parametrize the director as @xmath58 it is worth noting that a deformation tensor of the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ formoflambda ] ) leads to a particularly simple expression for the semi - soft contribution to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , which combines with the tilt energy density to @xmath61 .",
    "thus , as indicated above , our model depends for the experimental geometries under consideration on @xmath39 and @xmath46 through a single effective parameter , viz.@xmath62 .    from the photos of the experimental samples provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , see figs .  [",
    "fig : sliderapparatus ] and [ fig : tiltapparatus ] , it appears as if @xmath63 does not deviate significantly from 1 . in the following",
    ", we set @xmath64 for simplicity  @xcite .",
    "in this event @xmath65 . in the slider apparatus , the extent of the sample in the @xmath54-direction is fixed , and hence @xmath66 . the incompressibility constraint @xmath19 thus mandates that @xmath67 .",
    "the remaining nonzero component of the deformation tensor is entirely determined by the externally imposed shear , @xmath68 , where @xmath9 is the mechanical tilt angle of the sample , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sliderapparatus ] . the only remaining degree of freedom in the problem is , therefore , the angle @xmath4 .    to calculate @xmath4 as a function of @xmath9 , we insert the just discussed deformation tensor into @xmath59 and then minimize @xmath59 over @xmath4 holding @xmath9 fixed . for @xmath9 small , this can be done analytically by expanding @xmath59 to harmonic order in @xmath4 and by then solving the resulting linear equation of state for equilibrium value of @xmath4 .",
    "this type of analysis is presented in the appendix . to provide reliable predictions for larger shears",
    ", one has to refrain from expanding in @xmath4 and use numerical methods instead .",
    "to this end , we minimize @xmath59 numerically assuming , based on what we discussed at the end of sec .  [ sec : extendingaw ] , that @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for this minimization ,",
    "we use mathematica s findminimum routine .",
    "figure  [ fig : thetasliderapparatus ] shows the resulting curves for @xmath4 as a function of @xmath9 . the dashed horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : thetasliderapparatus ] is a guide to the eye ; it corresponds to the angle resolution in the kf experiments which was about @xmath71 degree  @xcite .     between the layer normal and the director as a function of the mechanical tilt angle @xmath9 in the slider apparatus for ( i ) @xmath72 , ( ii ) @xmath73 , ( iii ) @xmath74 , and ( iv ) @xmath75 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the resolution for @xmath4 in the experiments by kf.,width=279 ]    for the slider geometry , the kf data produces clear evidence for the development of sm@xmath1-like tilt under simple shear , and our theoretical estimates agree well with the experimental data .",
    "however , given that thus far only two data points are available for @xmath76 , it can not be judged reliably whether our theoretical curve could be fitted to an experimental curve with more data points .",
    "it is encouraging , though , that our curve for @xmath72 agrees with the available experimental points within their errors .",
    "now we turn to the tilt geometry .",
    "the essential difference between the slider and the tilt geometry is that in the former the height of the sample @xmath77 remains constant , @xmath78 ( @xmath32 times the number of smectic layers ) whereas in an ideal tilter , @xmath77 is not constant but rather decreases as @xmath9 increases , @xmath79",
    ". this difference has far reaching consequences . in the slider ,",
    "the sample - height remains larger than the modified natural height of the sample created by the director tilt , @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , the sample is under effective tension . in the tilter ,",
    "on the other hand , the sample - height @xmath81 can be smaller than @xmath82 , i.e. , the sample can be under effective compression . for a sample under effective @xmath83-compression , one has to worry , experimentally and theoretically , about all sorts of complications .",
    "most notable are perhaps buckling and wrinkling .",
    "the theory of buckling of elastic sheets is well established  @xcite , and we now briefly comment on buckling in the context of the tilt geometry . as mentioned above , a sample clamped into the tilt apparatus can develop a buckling instability , if the height of the sample imposed by tilt , @xmath84 , is smaller than the natural height of the sample created by the director tilt , @xmath82 . as we will see below ,",
    "our results for @xmath4 as a function of @xmath9 imply that @xmath85 , i.e. , buckling is possible .",
    "alternatively , this can be seen by calculating the engineering stress @xmath86 , which can be done using the numerical approach outline above .",
    "@xmath87 is positive for @xmath88 in the slider apparatus , whereas it turns out being negative for @xmath88 in the tilt apparatus .",
    "thus , the sample is effectively under tension in the slider apparatus whereas it is effectively under compression in the tilt apparatus , opening the possibility for buckling in the @xmath89-direction in the latter . the angle @xmath90 at which buckling sets in is expected to be comparable to that for the well known euler strut instability  @xcite , @xmath91,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the thickness of the sample in the @xmath89-direction , and where clamped ( rather than hinged ) boundary conditions are assumed . a brief derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eulerangle ] ) is given in app .",
    "[ app : euler ] . in the experiments of kf , @xmath93 and @xmath94  @xcite , which leads to @xmath95 .",
    "the experimental samples buckle immediately before they rupture  @xcite at @xmath96 or @xmath97 , which is very close to our estimate for @xmath90 .",
    "the observation that buckling occurs immediately before rupturing might suggest that the former actually triggers the latter .",
    "a detailed analysis of sample - wrinkling in the tilt geometry is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , a few comments about wrinkling are in order .",
    "the wavelength of wrinkling is expected to be much shorter than that of buckling .",
    "thus , wrinkling can be harder to detect by visual inspection of an experimental sample than buckling , and there is a risk that it remains unnoticed .",
    "the main problem is , however , that wrinkling can act as to effectively reduce the mechanical shear in the sample .",
    "when designing a tilt experiment , one thus has be very careful to avoid wrinkling . if not , the effects of wrinkling can bias the data , and there is the risk to underestimate the sm@xmath1-tilt significantly .",
    "our calculation of the the sm@xmath1-tilt will be for an ideal tilter .",
    "figure  [ fig : tiltschematic ] shows the tilter of fig .  [ fig : tiltapparatus ] schematically in a non - tilted and a tilted configuration to make clear that shear and compression are complex in the non - ideal case because the frame - axles allowing angle change are off - set from the corners of the sample .        using elementary trigonometry",
    ", one can deduce for the shears and the angle @xmath9 @xmath98 in particular , the relation between the shear angle @xmath9 and the deformation components @xmath99 and @xmath100 is not simple .",
    "returning to an ideal tilter , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , we calculate the sm@xmath1-tilt as a function of the applied mechanical shear , suppressing buckling and wrinkling .",
    "then , the deformation tensor is of the same form  ( [ formoflambda ] ) as for the slider apparatus , but with the essential difference that here @xmath103 and @xmath104 . as we did for the slider apparatus",
    ", we assume @xmath64 .",
    "the incompressibility constraint then implies that @xmath105 , leaving the angle @xmath4 as the only degree of freedom .",
    "we calculate @xmath4 as a function of @xmath9 in exactly the same way as above , i.e. , we minimize @xmath59 numerically assuming the values of the model parameters discussed in sec .",

    "[ fig : thetatiltapparatus ] occurs because of a competition between @xmath52 which would prefer @xmath40 and @xmath31 which would prefer @xmath106 . if @xmath107 then it is possible to get curves where @xmath4 stays close to @xmath108 .",
    "the dashed horizontal line in fig .  [ fig : thetatiltapparatus ] indicates the angle resolution of about @xmath71 degree of the kf experiments  @xcite .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : sliderapparatus ] , the data points for the slider are compatible with @xmath109 .",
    "the elastomers used by kf in the slider and the tilter are identical , and , therefore , curve ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : thetatiltapparatus ] should describe the sm@xmath1-tilt if the tilter used by kf were ideal or nearly so .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ fig : thetatiltapparatus ] , however , that this implies that the sm@xmath1-tilt for an ideal tilter at @xmath110 or @xmath111 should be significantly larger than the experimental resolution , which is incompatible with the findings of refs .  @xcite .",
    "since any effective compression of the sample along the layer normal , as in a tilter , promotes rather than hampers director rotation , we obtain a sm@xmath1-tilt at a given @xmath9 in a tilter if it occurs at the same angle in the slider .",
    "it is likely that the failure of kf to observe director rotation in their tilter is due to mechanical instability that effectively reduces the mechanical shear of the sample and thus leads to a systematic suppression of the sm@xmath1-tilt in the tilt geometry .",
    "in summary , we have developed a _",
    "neo - classical _ model for smectic elastomers , and we used this model to study sm@xmath0 elastomers under shear in the plane containing the director and the layer normal .",
    "in particular , we investigated the tilt angle @xmath4 between the layer normal and the director for two different experimental setups as a function of the mechanical tilt angle @xmath9 measuring the imposed shear .",
    "our model builds upon the _ neo - classical _ model for smectic elastomers by aw . in their original work ,",
    "aw chose not to consider the possibility of sm@xmath1 order in their theory : they forced the layer normal and the nematic director to be parallel . in our present theory ,",
    "the fundamental tenet is different in that the nematic director @xmath2 and the deformation tensor @xmath14 are independent quantities that must be allowed to seek their equilibrium in the presence of imposed strains or stresses .",
    "the layer normal @xmath3 is determined entirely by @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are independent variables that rotate to minimize the free energy - they are not locked together .    in the present paper , we have for simplicity focused on idealized monodomain samples .",
    "boundary conditions in real experiments prevent this simple scenario and produce a microstructure structure of the type that aw discuss in ref .",
    "@xcite based on their original model that prohibits sm@xmath1 ordering . our current theory , which admits sm@xmath1 ordering , predicts the same type of microstructure",
    "; stretching will produce a polydomain layer structure just as the aw theory does .",
    "in particular , the existence of sm@xmath1 ordering does not contradict the appearance of optical cloudiness . to avoid undue repetition , we refrain discussing this here in more detail and refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "the main finding of our present work is that the tilt angle @xmath4 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is non - zero if a shear in the plane containing @xmath3 is imposed .",
    "this angle depends on material parameters , the experimental setup , and the magnitude of the imposed shear .",
    "figures  [ fig : thetasliderapparatus ] and [ fig : thetatiltapparatus ] depict our results for the slider apparatus and the tilt apparatus used by kf . as expected , in both setups the angle @xmath4 decreases as the value of the parameter @xmath53 increases , at fixed @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the director is becoming more strongly anchored to the layer normal .",
    "if one keeps @xmath53 fixed and varies @xmath112 instead , then for @xmath113 @xmath4 approaches @xmath9 because in this limit @xmath114 locks @xmath4 to @xmath106 . as @xmath112 is decreased then @xmath4 decreases at fixed @xmath9 , because the @xmath115 term starts to compete with the @xmath116 term . in the opposite limit of very small @xmath112 , @xmath4 is locked to @xmath40 by virtue of the tilt and semi - soft contributions to @xmath59 .",
    "we refrain to show the corresponding curves , which are similar to those depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : thetasliderapparatus ] and [ fig : thetatiltapparatus ] , to save space .",
    "the main difference between our results for the two setups is that for @xmath117 and large @xmath9 , say @xmath118 degrees or so , @xmath4 is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath9 in the slider apparatus , whereas it is of the order of @xmath9 in the tilt apparatus .    in closing , we would like to stress once more that the experiment using the slider geometry produces clear evidence of the development of sm@xmath1-like tilt under shear as predicted originally in ref .",
    "@xcite . our theory developed here allowed us to understand in some detail how the magnitude of this tilt depends on the shear geometry and on model / material parameters , such as @xmath52 , which can be reasonably estimated from nematic analogues .",
    "given these estimates , the resulting estimates for the tilt angle vary over a range from being small enough to be essentially unobservable with the x - ray equipment used by the freiburg group to exceeding the experimental resolution .",
    "while the latter is consistent with the shear experiments in the slider geometry , the former is consistent with the stretching experiments by nishikawa and finkelmann in which no sm@xmath1-like tilt was detected .",
    "we believe that the reason for the discrepancy between the rotations in the slider and tilter apparatus lies in a possible wrinkling of the samples in the tilt apparatus used by kf .",
    "mechanical instability leads to an effective reduction of the mechanical shear of the sample causing a systematic underestimation of the sm@xmath1-like tilt in the tilt geometry .",
    "another experimental approach that could be used , at least in principle , to investigate @xmath4 is to measure changes in the layer spacing , as was done by nishikawa and finkelmann  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in this approach one measures @xmath119 rather than @xmath4 directly .",
    "for small values of sm@xmath1 tilt , say @xmath120 degree , @xmath121 which is practically indistinguishable from the @xmath122 pertaining to sm@xmath0 order .    for a refined comparison between experiment and theory it would be useful to critically evaluate and potentially improve the design of the tilt apparatuses regarding sample - wrinkling .",
    "also , it would be interesting to perform shear and stretching experiments with an angle resolution better than @xmath123 .",
