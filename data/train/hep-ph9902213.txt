    "these notes are not an introduction to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions .",
    "many excellent textbooks exist where the interested reader can find clear expositions of the subject@xcite .",
    "in fact we shall assume here that the reader is familiar with the basic technical tenets of perturbative qcd , such as feynman diagrams , dimensional regularization , renormalization , beta function and so on .",
    "we pretend rather to give physical insight of the reasons behind a rather remarkable theoretical development which is nearly as old as qcd itself , namely deep inelastic scattering .",
    "why is it so remarkable ?",
    "qcd is , in a way , a rather simple theory ( specially when compared to the intricacies of the electroweak part of the standard model ) .",
    "it is just a simple extension of good old quantum electrodynamics . instead of matter fields carrying electrical charge",
    "+ 1 ( and anticharge -1 ) , if we are talking about electrons , the matter fields of qcd ( the quarks ) carry a new quantum number : color .",
    "color can take three different values ( and their corresponding anti - values ) . furthermore the intermediate bosons ( the gluons ) , unlike photons which can not change the charge of a particle , change the color of a quark .",
    "they may for instance turn a red quark into a blue quark .",
    "this simple fact implies that the gauge group of qcd is much larger that the @xmath3 of qed .",
    "since every quark comes in three copies , whose labels get exchanged , there is a @xmath4 invariance and not @xmath5 which would have nine gluons has to do with the mathematical fact that @xmath6 is not an invariant tensor of @xmath5 .",
    "this tensor is necessary to build combinations of three quarks which are antisymmetric , as required by fermi statistics .",
    "for instance , @xmath7 .",
    "being the lightest hadron with this quark contents we expect to have the three quarks in the ground state , hence in a symmetric wave function .",
    "this is in contradiction with fermi statistics .",
    "the contradiction can be solved if we admit the existence of a new quantum number @xmath8 and @xmath9 . ] .",
    "simple as this theory may seem , it is not an easy matter in qcd to relate theory and experiment .",
    "it is well known that the fields and particles we know how to compute with ( with the simplest tool at our disposal , perturbation theory ) are not those that are observed by experimentalists in their detectors due to the phenomenon of confinement .",
    "quarks and gluons are real , but they can not be detected as free particles as they are known to be confined inside hadrons . in view of this is quite remarkable that there are theoretical techniques enabling us to put the theory to very stringent tests .",
    "the phenomenon of confinement comes about because the coupling constant of qcd ( which is relatively small at large values of the momentum transfer , the value quoted by the particle data group@xcite is @xmath10 ; notice the truly amazing precision , which may soon be reduced to a mere 1% ) becomes strong as the energy decreases .",
    "the behaviour predicted by the renormalization - group is , at one loop , _",
    "s(q)=-.[alfa ] where @xmath11 is a renormalization - group invariant , but scheme dependent , quantity and @xmath12 .",
    "the preferred value is @xmath13 mev ( 5 flavours , @xmath14-scheme ) .",
    "the meaning of the scale - dependent , renormalized coupling constant is roughly the following : it is the  effective \" coupling , relevant at the scale @xmath15 , namely , the one that ( within the choosen scheme ) minimizes further quantum corrections , in particular resumming all large logs . from ( [ alfa ] )",
    "we see that precisely at the scale @xmath16 , the effective coupling has a pole .",
    "of course well before that scale is reached perturbation theory becomes completely unreliable , and the @xmath17 potential of the perturbative interaction change to a stronger behaviour , possibly to a linear @xmath18 behaviour . when computing the production of any physical hadron ( typically of mass @xmath19 few @xmath11 ) , perturbation theory is completely useless .",
    "one instance where perturbative qcd can be applied is to inclusive processes , provided that the characteristic momentum transfer is large enough .",
    "these will not be discussed in this lecture .",
    "the interested reader can look at the determination of @xmath0 through @xmath20 @xmath21 , for instance in.@xcite    a clear application of perturbative qcd is provided by deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the subject is now over twenty years old and , by now , perturbative qcd has been tested to a high degree .",
    "furthermore , the commissioning of hera has opened a new kinematical region where it may be possible to study the onset of non - perturbative effects in a controlled fashion .",
    "the exploration of this region is a fascinating subject interesting on its own right .    due to the lack of time and space we have not included two sections that , in our view , should be in any general review of perturbative qcd and deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the first one concerns the so - called  spin of the proton \" problem@xcite .",
    "another topic that is not covered at all is the study of the photon structure functions.@xcite the list of references is very incomplete and those provided merely reflect personal tastes .",
    "beyond tree level most feynman diagrams are ultraviolet divergent .",
    "take for instance the one diagram contributing at one loop to the gluon propagator . neglecting external momenta ,",
    "the integral over the momenta of the internal particles is of the form = . [ integral ] to make sense of the theory and get a finite result we must introduce a cut - off @xmath22 and counterterms .",
    "a possible method is to perform a subtraction at some @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , for the self - energy of the gluon propagator ( q^2)-(-^2)_r(q^2)=finite.[pi ] alternatively we can make sense of the integrals using dimensional regularization by continuing the dimensionality from 4 to @xmath24 , [ reg ] and subtract just the poles in @xmath25 ( minimal subtraction , @xmath26 ) or also the @xmath27 that always accompanies the singularity in @xmath25 ( improved minimal subtraction , @xmath14 ) . for instance , for the quark contribution to the gluon self - energy ,",
    "one has the following result after computing the integral in @xmath28 dimensions ( q^2)=-_s_ab ( 1+_e++  ) .",
    "[ renorm ] using the @xmath26 and @xmath14 schemes one gets _ ms(q^2)=-_s_ab ( _ e++  ) _ ( q^2)=-_s_ab ( +  ) [ renorm1 ] the above expressions illustrate the appeareance of ultraviolet logs @xmath29 through the renormalization procedure .",
    "there are , however , other source of logs in qcd .",
    "they are of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 can is some external momentum squared or a small ( mass)@xmath32 that we have given by hand to the ( massless ) gluon . while the former are associated to ultraviolet divergent integrals ( integrals with a bad behaviour when the internal momentum is large ) , the latter are infrared logs and are related to feynman diagrams with a bad behaviour when one or more external momenta vanish .",
    "ultraviolet logs appear in any renormalizable field theory after renormalization . on the contrary",
    ", infrared logs appear whenever a theory has massless particles in the spectrum ( such as photons or gluons )",
    ". a given feyman diagram can give rise to both type of singularities at the same time .",
    "there actually two classes of infrared logs caused by massless particles .",
    "the so - called infrared divergences arise from the presence of a _ soft massless _ particle ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "for instance in the process @xmath34 at the one loop level we have to compute the integral ( figure [ fig1 ] )    .",
    "when @xmath35 the integral behaves for @xmath33 as .[sing ] and diverges .",
    "this divergence is unphysical so it must be cancelled by something else .",
    "the bloch - nordsieck theorem@xcite states that in inclusive enough cross - sections the infrared logs cancel .",
    "what do we mean by ` inclusive enough ' ?",
    "a detector will not be able to discern a ` true ' muon from a muon accompanied by a soft enough photon ( with @xmath36 ) .",
    "therefore , we have to consider diagrams where a soft photon is radiated by the muon , square the modulus of the amplitude and integrate over the available phase space ( which actually depends on the experimental cut ) . when this is done the result is infrared finite .",
    "the relevant diagrams are depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "= 1.3 cm    the other type of infrared logs are called mass singularities .",
    "they occur in theories with massless particles because two _ parallel massless _ particles have an invariant mass equal to zero k^2=(k_1+k_2)^2=(_1+_2,0,0 , _",
    "1+_2)=0.[invar ] the appeareance of such a mass singularity is illustrated in figure 3    = 2.5 cm    = 1,[propa ] the denominator vanishes when we set all particles on shell ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath39 is parallel to @xmath40 ) . even if one of the two particles is massive",
    "there is a singularity , provided the 3-momenta are parallel .",
    "the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem@xcite ensures that for inclusive enough cross section the mass singularities also cancel .",
    "both for mass singularities and for infrared divergences there is a trade - off between @xmath31 , the infrared regulator of a massless particle , and the energy and angle resolution of the inclusive cross section @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    in practice , it is better to regulate the infrared logs using dimensional regularization ( introducing @xmath31 leads to difficulties with gauge invariance ) .",
    "real gluon emission diagrams are regulated by performing the phase space integration in @xmath43 dimensions .",
    "there is in fact a lot of physical insight hidden in the infrared logs .",
    "physical arguments tell us that the probability of finding a ` bare ' isolated muon should be _",
    "zero_. we know this because detectors are unable to tell apart a muon from a muon plus one soft photon or indeed from a muon plus any number of soft photons . infrared divergences in qed can be summed up and then one sees that the probability of finding an isolated muon is indeed zero and not infinite as the one loop diagram led us to believe .",
    "whenever a feynman diagram is infrared divergent it means that we have forgotten something relevant .",
    "let us consider in qed the interaction of a charged fermion with an external source and let us expand in the number of _ virtual _ photons @xmath43 ( i.e. in the number of loops ) .",
    "the total amplitude will be expressed as m(p , p^)=_n=0^m_n(p , p^ ) [ expon ] then a calculation shows that m_0 & = & m_0 , + m_1 & = & m_0b+m_1 , + m_2 & = & m_0(b)^22+m_1b + m_2 , + & &  [ exxx ] the quantities @xmath44 are ir - finite , while @xmath45 is ir - divergent .",
    "the series in ( [ expon ] ) can be summed up m=(b)_n=0^m_n , m_n~^n , [ expon1 ] and @xmath45 can be obtained just from the lowest order diagram . introducing an ir cut - off @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which indeed shows that when we remove the cut - off the probability of finding an isolated charged fermion is zero in qed .",
    "the addition of soft photons changes that result , multiplying the total amplitude by a factor @xmath48 .",
    "there is a trade between the infrared regulator and @xmath49 .",
    "the latter are , of course , detector - dependent quantities .",
    "although only partial results exist@xcite , it is believed that a similar exponentiation takes place in qcd . due to the confinement subtleties",
    "it is unclear whether the suppression factor is compensated by radiation of soft gluons . even if this compensation does actually take place that would not disprove confinement , only that confinement would have nothing to do with the structure of infrared singularities of the theory .",
    "the previous discussion can be summarized in the following way : due to ir singularities one is forced to consider cross sections not of individual particles in the final state , but rather of bunches of particles , each ` hard ' quark and gluon surrounded by a ` soft ' cloud of gluons and , perhaps , quarks .",
    "these bunches are called ` jets ' .",
    "the bloch - nordsieck and kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorems guarantee the finiteness of the cross - sections . we have to define an energy and angle resolution . for instance , if @xmath50 is the momentum of a primary quark we can impose that the energy of each soft particle in its jet satisfies @xmath51 and also that @xmath52 .",
    "we will get singularities of the form @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "the specific details depend on the precise definition of the jet .",
    "the counterpart of having an effective coupling constant which grows at low energies is that the theory becomes simple at high energies , making perturbative calculations possible ( at least _ some _ of them ) .",
    "indeed a brilliant confirmation of the existence of nearly free constituents inside the nucleon was provided more than twenty years ago by a series of experiments carried out at slac@xcite .",
    "then it became possible to scatter electrons off nucleons in fixed target experiments with a typical momentum transfer @xmath55 ( gev)@xmath32 , a kinematical range unexplored until that time .",
    "the kinematics of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes is shown in fig .",

    "thus deep inelastic is a two - step process    * short distance scattering occurs with a large momentum transfer .",
    "well described by perturbation theory .",
    "* outgoing particles recombine . not calculable in perturbation theory",
    ".    however , the second part can be side - stepped all together for fully inclusive rates .",
    "then perturbation theory is adecuate to describe many features of dis .",
    "if we place ourselves in the center of mass of the hadron and virtual intermediate boson both particles move very fast towards each other .",
    "whatever components the hadron contains they will all have moments parallel to @xmath59 , up to transversal motion of @xmath57 .",

    "no complete calculation exists yet at the nnlo to my knowledge , just some partial results .",
    "it is important to realize that the altarelli - parisi equations are not exact .",
    "they take into account the perturbative contribution only ( and this up to a given order in perturbation theory ) .",
    "they also neglect transverse motion , which leads to corrections of @xmath130 to the leading results .",
    "these are more easily dealt with in the perhaps more rigorous ( but more cumbersome ) treatment based in the operator product expansion@xcite , which will not be discussed here .",
    "target mass corrections should be equally taken into account .",
    "they are particularly important near thresholds ( such as the charm and bottom thresholds ) .",
    "for instance the proper treatment of thresholds is highly relevant for hera , since a big chunk of the data comes from a region close to these thresholds . and , of course , mass corrections are important for charm pdf from the sea , which have actually been recently measured .",
    "the analysis of deep inelastic scattering based on the altarelli - parisi equations ( or , alternatively , on the operator product expansion ) has been one of the most clear tests of perturbative qcd and traditionally the best way of determining @xmath0 , which , as we have seen , enters in the scaling violations . however , at present the value of @xmath131 extracted from z - physics is equally accurate if not more .    for some time",
    "a discrepancy was claimed between the value of @xmath0 obtained from the analysis of scaling violations and the z - pole value .",
    "for instance the value quoted by ccfr was @xmath132 , well below the world average@xcite , and quite away , for instance , from measurements based on event shapes at the @xmath73 peak ( @xmath133 ; for measurements of @xmath0 at lep , see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the average @xmath0 from dis was given@xcite just two years ago to be @xmath134 .",
    "theoretical speculations were fuelled and it was claimed that non - perturbative corrections could be larger than originally thought .",
    "deep inelastic scattering data have been reanalyzed recently and the quoted value for @xmath131 from dis from a global fit@xcite to all data is @xmath135 .",
    "the agreement with other determinations is now almost perfect .",
    "the discrepancy was apparently due , it is claimed , to the energy calibration of the detector ( in the case of ccfr , at least ; the new ccfr value is @xmath136@xcite ) , a better understanding of higher twist corrections ( not discussed here ) and from the treatment of the contribution from heavy quarks from the sea , charm in particular .",
    "we will see later , when we discuss in somewhat more detail the form of the pdf , that one must actually make a number of hypothesis before being able to extract @xmath131 .",
    "while do not regard the issue as totally settled yet , because some of the older data sets are very poorly described by the now preferred value of @xmath131 , the most recent data coming from hera@xcite ( h1 and zeus ) give values which agree nicely with each other and in fact fall well in the high @xmath0 range , almost on top of the new average value .",
    "these ongoing experiments will become statistically more and more significant in the near future in the determination of @xmath131 as more and more data points pile up .",
    "we do not know in general how to compute the parton distribution functions , even for @xmath137 . only their evolution can be reliably computed either through the operator product expansion of the use of the altarelli - parisi equations and this for large enough values of @xmath89 .",
    "the scaling behaviour is governed by the anomalous dimensions . at leading order",
    "qq(j)= c_f[-+ -2_k=2^j],[ano1 ] _ qg(j)=t_r[],[ano2 ] _ gq(j)=c_f[],[ano3 ] _ gg(j)=2c_a[-+ + -_k=2^j]-t_r,[ano4 ] where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are group - theoretical factors .",
    "an interesting issue is the behaviour of the parton distribution functions at the endpoints @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the large @xmath43 behaviour of the moments probes the @xmath142 region .",
    "since it is natural to expect that at the kinematical boundaries the parton distribution functions vanish , one can make the following ansatz for @xmath142 q(x , q^2)~a(q^2 ) ( 1-x)^(_s(q^2))-1.[ansatz1 ] demanding that eq .",
    "( [ ansatz1 ] ) fulfills the @xmath105 evolution equation leads to a(q^2)=a_0 [ _ s(q^2)]^-d_0(_s)=_0 -16_s(q^2 ) , [ ansatz2 ] d_0=16(34-_e).[ansatz3 ] likewise , for the gluons we have g(x , q^2)~a_0^.[ansatz4 ] the constants @xmath143 and @xmath144 are not calculable on perturbative qcd and depend on the specific operator .",
    "@xmath145 is universal .",
    "when @xmath142 the gluon distribution functions approach zero more rapidly than the quark ones . for large values of @xmath1 the quark contents of nucleons is the relevant one .",
    "second order corrections to this asymptotic behaviour can be derived in a similar way and are known .",
    "it turns out that the correction is arbitraryly large if one gets sufficiently close to @xmath141 .",
    "this is because the collinear gluon is , in addition , soft in that exceptional configuration thus giving rise to a @xmath146 singularity .",
    "multiple emission is then kinematically favoured , since the log overcomes the @xmath0 suppression .    for small values of @xmath1",
    "the opposite behaviour takes place , the gluon distribution function eventually becomes dominant . at lhc",
    "the cross - section will be greatly dominated by low-@xmath1 physics and the important process there will be gluon - gluon scattering . at the current tevatron",
    "run the quark contents of protons and antiprotons is still dominant .",
    "let us see why gluons dominate completely at low @xmath1 .",
    "the key point is the appeareance of the singularity for @xmath147 . indeed , as @xmath148 _",
    "gg(j)~. then g(j , t)=g(j , t_0 ) . then we proceed to evaluate @xmath149 by performing an inverse mellin transform xg(x , t)=_c dj x^1-j g(j , t ) .",
    "the integration circuit is a line in the direction of the imaginary axis in the complex @xmath150 plane , to the right of the @xmath147 singularity .",
    "the saddle point method can now be used provided that @xmath151 is large and this is the reason why this procedure gives only the small @xmath1 behaviour .",
    "working things out we see that the gluon parton distribution function for low @xmath1 behaves as g(x)~1x,[gluonx ] where @xmath152 is calculable .",
    "unfortunately , this answer is not totally satisfactory because something must stop the growth in @xmath88 for low @xmath1 , or else one runs into unitarity problems sooner or later , and thus eq . ( [ gluonx ] ) it is not credible all the way to @xmath140 . technically speaking , there must be corrections that destabilize the saddle point solution .",
    "physically , the uncontrolled growth of the gluon distribution is an infrared unstability .",
    "the density of soft gluons is too large . shadowing and non - linear evolution equations are the buzzwords here@xcite .",
    "the double scaling limit ( high @xmath112 , low @xmath1 ) is well supported by the data .",
    "see for instance@xcite for a recent analysis coming from measurements of @xmath100 at h1 .    except in these two limiting cases ,",
    "pdf s have to be parametrized .",
    "the way one proceeds is by proposing a given parametrization at some reference value @xmath153 , then evolve to all desired values of @xmath112 using the altarelli - parisi equations , then perform a global fit of the parameters describing the pdf and , at the same time , determine @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath11 sets a natural scale in the theory .",
    "well above @xmath11 perturbation theory makes sense .",
    "of course perturbative qcd at large enough energies describes a world of quasi - free quarks , interacting with coulomb - like forces .",
    "we know very well that hadronic physics is a very different world where quarks are confined into colorless hadrons .",
    "as soon as @xmath154 perturbation theory is unreliable .",
    "it simply can not explain confinement .",
    "what confinement means is that there is a force between quarks that does not decrease with distance .",
    "there is indeed phenomenological evidence ( which is supported by lattice analysis ) that the interquark potential at large distances in qcd is of the form v(r)~a^2_qcdr -br +  [ conf ] the first term is a confining quark potential .",
    "the constant @xmath155 has to be @xmath156 because @xmath157 is the only dimensional quantity at our disposal .",
    "the coulombic part is called the lscher term and plays a crucial role in heavy quark spectroscopy@xcite .    at short distances",
    "the behaviour of the interquark potential is totally different .",
    "it is coulomb - like v(r)~-.[coul ] different quarks probe the different regimes . indeed , because @xmath158 is so small ( say @xmath159 ) , the corresponding bohr radius is @xmath160 fm , much smaller than @xmath161 . the coulombic part of the interquark potential largely dominates .",
    "( at such short distances the linearly rising potential is not at work , the leading confinement effects are @xmath162 , as discussed by leutwyler some time ago@xcite , but they can be safely neglected at first approximation . )    bottom and charm are in a somewhat intermediate position .",
    "@xmath163 is still relatively small .",
    "the bohr radius is @xmath164 fm , smaller but comparable to @xmath161 .",
    "spectroscopy is basically perturbative , at least for the lowest levels , but some non - perturbative effects are visible .",
    "charm is really no - man s land .",
    "both perturbative and non - perturbative effects compete even for the ground state @xmath165 . for light quarks",
    "the bohr radius is several fm and the confining potential is fully at work .    the existence of a confining potential leads to very large multiplicities and jets .",
    "one can imagine a quark - antiquark being formed at the primary vertex then moving apart .",
    "part of their kinetic energy is deposited in the interquark potential as they move away . very quickly",
    "a separation @xmath166 is reached where the energy deposited is enough to form a new quark - antiquark pair , ^2_qcd r_m2 m_q,[break ] at that moment the quark - antiquark ` string ' breaks and the process is repeated until the average relative momentum is small enough and hadronization takes place .",
    "there is a lot of physics in the string picture .",
    "we can think of color forces being confined in some sort of tube or string joining the two moving quarks .",
    "the chromodynamic energy is thus stored in a relatively small region of space - time .",
    "if this picture is correct we should expect hadronization to take place in this region in preference to any other .",
    "this is indeed the case ; in three jet events ( which originate from @xmath167 , with a hard gluon ) there is a clear enhancement of soft gluon and hadron production in the regions between color lines ( representing the gluon by a double color line , or @xmath168 state ) , and a relative depletion in other regions .",
    "this phenomenon is called color coherence@xcite .",
    "we now backtrack in history , to the pre - qcd days , and recall that in the 60 s the duality hypothesis was much in fashion .",
    "the hypothesis stated that in strong interactions a sum over intermediate states in the @xmath169-channel should reproduce the sum over resonances in the @xmath127-channel .",
    "mathematically , a(s , t)=_j = _ j.[duality ] of course for this to have even a chance of being true an infinite number of intermediate states is required .",
    "it should be stated right away that the evidence for this peculiar property was ( and still is ) rather weak .",
    "however , in 1968 , veneziano@xcite took the idea seriously and proposed the following amplitude a(s , t)= , ( s)=(0)+ ^s.[venamp ] this amplitude is manifestly dual . in 1969 and 1970",
    "y.nambu and others unveiled the relation between the veneziano amplitude and open string theory .",
    "it was later generalized to closed strings by koba and nielsen .",
    "this of course is the way to make contact with the long - distance properties of qcd that we have discussed in the previous section .",
    "if in some kinematical regime qcd can be described by some type of string theory , an amplitude of the veneziano type should describe strong interactions in a regime where perturbation theory is not valid .",
    "unfortunately life is not so easy .",
    "first of all , consistency of string theory requires @xmath170 and then the veneziano amplitude exhibits poles in the @xmath169-channel whenever @xmath171 , @xmath172 . there is a tachyonic scalar / pseudoscalar particle and a massless vector particle .",
    "in addition , the amplitude does not exhibit the proper chiral behaviour ( adler zero ) , i.e. @xmath173 , if we are to interpret the pseudoscalars as pions .",
    "it is a complete phenomenological failure .",
    "lovelace and shapiro@xcite finally proposed an amplitude with the correct behaviour or , at least , not manifestly incorrect .",
    "it is inspired from the theory of supersymmetric strings and the equivalent of the veneziano amplitude now reads a(s , t)=,(s)=(0)+^s , [ shapiro ] where @xmath174 in principle also equals 1 here .",
    "again this amplitude ( which is tachyon - free  this is the main virtue of the supersymmetric string ) is not physically acceptable because the amplitude does not have the correct adler zero .",
    "however , it does reproduce the right chiral behaviour if one replaces by hand this value by 1/2 and is then appropriate to describe pion scattering .",
    "unfortunately this replacement can not be derived at present from any known string theory .",
    "the corresponding trajectory is called the regge trajectory and corresponds to the exchange of open strings and , as discussed , has an intercept @xmath175 .",
    "physically this is interpreted as the exchange of quark - antiquark pairs in addition there is a pomeron trajectory which has an intercept @xmath176 , and is due to the exchange of closed strings ( interpreted as glueballs in qcd ) .",
    "let us now return to dis and let us see what all this has to do with it .",
    "let us consider the behaviour of the amplitude @xmath177 for large @xmath169 and fixed @xmath127 a(s , t)~s^^t + _ 0 .",
    "[ larges ] let us now assume that the elastic nucleon - parton amplitude ( figure 9 ) is described by such an amplitude .",
    "kinematically , @xmath178 .",
    "if we decompose k = xp - n + k_t,[decomp ] where @xmath43 is a vector such that @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , then , with the usual approximations , s=-2kp = -[relat ] we see then that , at a finite value of @xmath182 , low @xmath1 corresponds to the large @xmath169 behaviour . on the other hand , for this subprocess @xmath183 , and we of course realize that the amplitude is directly related to the cross - section for parton + proton @xmath184 anything . if the parton is a quark only the reggeon will contribute .",
    "if there is mixing with partonic gluons we will have a contribution from both the regge and pomeron trajectories .",
    "after a short calculation we shall conclude that f_2(x)~a_p x^0 + a_r x^.[predict ] and , therefore that , at low values of @xmath1 , g(x)~x^-1,q(x)~x^- .",
    "these are the implications of regge theory for the parton distribution functions .",
    "notice that there is no @xmath112 dependence anywhere , so the question poses itself as to which is the appropriate value of @xmath112 to compare with .",
    "the answer is not very well defined , but it should correspond to the typical range of energies where regge phenomenology is known to be valid in other contexts , i.e. a few gev .",
    "in fact , a fit to the gluon pdf shows that at @xmath185 gev@xmath32 , @xmath186 .",
    "the region below @xmath187 had not been explored experimentally until very recently ; a first look at these low-@xmath1 values has been provided by the commissioning of hera .",
    "hera is a machine ideally suited for an in - depth analysis of structure functions . it should be possible to arrive at very low values of @xmath1 ( down to @xmath188 ) .",
    "most parametrizations have traditionally performed very poorly when extrapolated to the low @xmath1 region .",
    "typically they predict an increase as @xmath189 which is lower than what is actually seen .",
    "the behaviour @xmath190 , with @xmath191 as @xmath189 , which is predicted from the bfkl evolution equation@xcite seemed at some point ( see e.g.@xcite ) to stand the comparison with hera results best .",
    "however , this behaviour is still incompatible with unitarity and can not hold all the way to @xmath140 either . if fact we know now that the predictions from bfkl can not be trusted .",
    "this has prompted a renewed interest in trying to extract the behaviour at low @xmath1 from conventional altarelli - parisi evolution .",
    "the consensus now seems to be that even for the low values of @xmath1 analyzed at hera there is no real evidence of any results beyond ordinary perturbative qcd .",
    "it is easy to understand why perturbative qcd must fail at some point .",
    "the expansion of the splitting function @xmath192 in powers of @xmath0 at the nlo actually resums all terms of the form @xmath193 and @xmath194 . looking at ( [ propa ] ) we see that the propagator causing the mass singularity is ( @xmath195 ) = -.[kate ] apart from the parametric integrals , we have .[corner ] this is the origin of the @xmath196 and , eventually , of the @xmath197",
    ".    the leading @xmath198 will thus be produced by one single region in integration ... , [ corner1 ] with @xmath199 .    at sufficiently large @xmath1 logarithms of @xmath200",
    "necessarily appear .",
    "we have actually seen them in the double scaling limit .",
    "they must , at some point , spoil the predictivity of the perturbative expansion .",
    "one must then identify the regions in integration capable of giving rise to terms of the form @xmath201 , and eventually to @xmath202 and so on .",
    "lipatov and coworkers@xcite ( see also@xcite for alternative derivations ) have identified such a contribution .",
    "it corresponds to the diagram depicted in figure 10 , more specifically to the region k_i=_ip + _ i n + k_i t,[bfkl1 ] _ 1_2 ...",
    "_n-1,k_i t~k_j t,_1_2 ... _ n-1.[bfkl3 ] this leads to splitting kernels similar to those of the altarelli - parisi equations f_2(x , q^2)=d^2 k_t_x^1 c(,q^2,k_t ) f_2(,k_t),[bfkl4 ] where @xmath203 obeys the differential equation f_2(,k_t^)= d^2k_t k(k_t^,k_t ) f_2 ( , k_t).[bfkl5 ] the bfkl kernel is now known to leading and subleading order.@xcite the leading asymptotic solution is f(x , k_t)~x^-4n .[bfkl6 ] unfortunately the corrections implied by the next - to - leading calculations are gigantic@xcite .",
    "there is no way of doing anything useful with bfkl scaling at present .",
    "as previously discussed this does not seem to be a problem for hera data since a careful analysis shows that perhaps surprisingly the data is well accounted for by ordinary perturbative qcd ( the matter is however somewhat controversial to this date ) , but it will come the day where @xmath204 corrections will be essential .",
