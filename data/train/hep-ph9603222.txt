    "the quest for understanding beyond the standard model physics and its implications for the present and future colliders has relied heavily on extended gauge structures of the standard model . among these supersymmetric grand unfied theories",
    "@xmath3 such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 have received significant attention , due to their correct prediction of the electroweak mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "these theories provide unfication of interactions at a higher scale than the ordinary @xmath6 , which prevents rapid proton decay .",
    "another attractive feature of these models is the prediction of a small but non - vanishing neutrino mass .",
    "indeed , anomalies measured in solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes seem to lend support to the idea that neutrinos should have a small but nonvanishing mass . the most promising candidate for a mechanism to give the neutrino a mass is the see - saw model , which explains the smallness of the neutrino mass in terms of the large majorana mass for a right - handed neutrino @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the introduction of three families for the right - handed neutrinos brings a new matrix for the yukawa couplings in the lepton sector , similar to the one in the quark sector .",
    "a simultaneous diagonalization of both matrices is quite accidental and , as in the quark sector , the new leptonic yukawa couplings cause lepton - flavour violation .",
    "this phenomenon could exist in a supersymmetric version of the standard model with the introduction of right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "it can also occur naturally in one of the @xmath8 models .",
    "the simplest extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model which would include right - handed neurinos naturally is the one based on the left - right symmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "we will investigate here lepton - flavor violating decays of the @xmath0-boson in a fully left - right supersymmetric model .",
    "the left - right supersymmetric model @xmath9 is an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model based on left - right symmetry .",
    "@xmath10 shares some of the attractive properties of the @xmath11 , like providing a natural solution for the gauge hierarchy problem ; and , in addition , @xmath10 supresses naturally rapid proton decay , by disallowing terms in the lagrangian that explicitly violate either baryon or lepton numbers  @xcite.it gauges the only quantum number left ungauged , @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath10 model shares some of the attractive features of the original left - right symmetric model  @xcite , such as providing a possible explanation for the strength of @xmath13 violation .",
    "it could be viewed as a low - energy realization of certain @xmath14 , such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "so far there is no experimental evidence for the right - handed interactions predicted by the @xmath15 theory , let alone by supersymmetry . yet",
    "the foundation of @xmath10 has so many attractive features that the model deserves some experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "the next generation of linear colliders will provide an excellent opportunity for such a study .",
    "the theoretical and experimental challenge lies in finding distinctive features for the left - right supersymmetric model , which allow it to be distinguished from both the susy version of the standard model and from the non - supersymmetric version of the left - right theory  @xcite .",
    "lepton - flavour violation decays are just the right type of such phenomena .",
    "the lrsusy model provides a natural framework for large lepton flavor - violating effects through two mechanisms : on one hand it can give rise to a leptonic decay width of the @xmath0-boson through both left - handed and right - handed scalar lepton mixing , on the other hand it contains lepton - flavor - blind higgsinos which couple to leptons only and enhance lepton - flavor violation .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the @xmath10 model ; in section 3 we discuss the supersymmetric contributions ( including both the @xmath11 and the @xmath10 contributions ) to the decay rate @xmath16 .",
    "we will conclude in section 4 with numerical estimates and discussion .",
    "the @xmath10 model , based on @xmath15 , has matter doublets for both left- and right- handed fermions and the corresponding left- and right - handed scalar partners ( sleptons and squarks )  @xcite . in the gauge sector , corresponding to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , there are triplet gauge bosons @xmath19 , @xmath20 and a singlet gauge boson @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 , together with their superpartners .",
    "the higgs sector of this model consists of two higgs bi - doublets , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are required to give masses to both the up and down quarks .",
    "in addition , the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the group @xmath25 to the hypercharge symmetry group @xmath26 is accomplished by introducing the higgs triplet fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the choice of the triplets ( versus four doublets ) is preferred because with this choice a large majorana mass can be generated for the right - handed neutrino and a small one for the left - handed neutrino   @xcite .",
    "in addition to the triplets @xmath29 , the model must contain two additional triplets @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with quantum number @xmath32 to insure cancellation of the anomalies that would otherwise occur in the fermionic sector .",
    "given their strange quantum numbers , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not couple to any of the particles in the theory so their contribution is negligible for any phenomenological studies .",
    "as in the standard model , in order to preserve @xmath35 gauge invariance , only the neutral higgs fields aquire non - zero vacuum expectation values @xmath36 .",
    "these values are : @xmath37 @xmath38 causes the mixing of @xmath39 and @xmath40 bosons with @xmath13-violating phase @xmath41 . in order to simplify",
    ", we will take the @xmath42 of the higgs fields as : @xmath43 and @xmath44 choosing @xmath45 satisfies the more loosely required hierarchy @xmath46 and also the required cancellation of flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "the higgs fields aquire non - zero @xmath42 to break both parity and @xmath18 . in the first stage of breaking the right - handed gauge bosons @xmath40 and @xmath47 aquire masses proportional to @xmath48 and",
    "become much heavier than the usual ( left - handed ) neutral gauge bosons @xmath39 and @xmath49 , which pick up masses proportional to @xmath50 and @xmath51 at the second stage of breaking .",
    "@xcite    the supersymmetric sector of the model , while preserving left - right symmetry , has four singly - charged charginos ( corresponding to @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) , in addition to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the model also has eleven neutralinos , corresponding to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "it has been shown that in the scalar sector , the left - triplet @xmath69 couplings can be neglected in phenomenological analyses of muon and tau decays  @xcite .",
    "also @xmath69 is not necessary for symmetry breaking  @xcite ; it is introduced only for preserving left - right symmetry .",
    "we will therefore neglect the couplings of @xmath69 in the fermionic sector .",
    "the doubly charged @xmath70 is however very important : it carries quantum number @xmath71 of 2 and couples only to leptons , therefore breaking lepton - quark universality . it and its supersymmetric partner could ,",
    "as will be seen in the next section , play an important role in flavour - violating leptonic decays .    in the scalar matter sector ,",
    "the @xmath10 contains two left - handed and two right - handed scalar fermions as partners of the ordinary leptons and quarks , which themselves come in left- and right - handed doublets . in general the left- and right - handed scalar leptons will mix together . some of the effects of this mixings , such as enhancement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , have been discussed elsewhere  @xcite",
    ". only global lepton - family - number violation would prevent @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 to mix arbitrarily .",
    "permitting this mixing to occur , we could expect small effects to occur in the non - supersymmetric sector , such as radiative muon or tau decays , in addition to other nonstandard effects such as massive neutrino oscillations and violation of lepton number itself .",
    "but , in general , allowing for the mixing , we have six charged - scalar lepton states ( involving 15 real angles and 10 complex phases ) and six scalar neutrinos ( also involving 15 real angles and 10 complex phases ) . in order to reduce the ( large ) number of parameters we shall assume in what folows that only two generations of scalar leptons ( the heaviest ) mix significantly  @xcite .",
    "the mixings are as follows : @xmath75 and @xmath76 with angle @xmath77 ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 with angle @xmath80 ; so that , for example : @xmath81 @xmath82 and similarly for @xmath83 and @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these states are the physical mass eigenstates .",
    "next we consider the implications of the above - mixing in the @xmath10 in lepton - flavor violating decays of the @xmath49 boson .",
    "there are two types of contributions to the lepton - number violating decays : one coming from the non - susy sector of the left - right model , the other type coming from the susy sector , through the contributions of supersymmetric partners . to keep the parameters to a minimum , we choose to evaluate analytically the contribution to amplitude for the decay @xmath86 due to the mixing of scalar leptons and scalar neutrinos and due to the charginos and neutralinos in the model .",
    "we note that the mass parameters which determine the contribution in the susy sector are independent ( in broken supersymmetry ) of the ones in the non - susy sector . for completeness , we refer the reader to  @xcite .    in general , the branching ratio for this process can be written as : @xmath87 and @xmath88 depend on the @xmath89 or @xmath90 character of the theory .",
    "such a branching ratio is restricted by @xmath91 to be _ e.g.   @xmath92  @xcite . _",
    "we assume that the leptonic masses are small ( and therefore negligible ) compared to at least one mass of a supersymmetric particle in the process .",
    "there are 9 relevant diagrams that contribute to @xmath93 and @xmath94 and they are listed in fig .  1 .",
    "the contributions from the individual graphs are listed below .",
    "first , the left - handed contributions which are similar , although not identical , to the ones in the @xmath11  @xcite :    @xmath95\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath96    @xmath97\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath98 \\hspace{2.7 cm } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath99    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , the functions @xmath102 are the three - point functions , and @xmath103 is a two - point function associated with the self - energy graphs .",
    "we follow the notation and conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details . in @xmath10",
    "mixing of right - handed scalar leptons as well as gauginos induce a nonuniversal coupling of the @xmath49 , @xmath104 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the contributions are as given below : @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath109\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath110 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113    here @xmath114 and @xmath115 arise from neutralino mixing and coupling at the vertices ; @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 arise from chargino mixing at the vertices .",
    "the expressions for these matrix elemens are rather lengthy ; they have been calculated previously , in a work dealing in detail with chargino and neutralino masses , and are listed in  @xcite .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the left - right supersymmetric contributions to the branching ratio @xmath119 depend on a plethora of parameters : chargino and neutralino masses and mixing matrix elements , as well as sleptons and sneutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "an exact evaluation of this cross section would require fixing all the parameters : clearly an impossible task .",
    "we attempt to estimate the possible values of the branching ratio in order to get an idea for the range of parameters and then compare the result with current experimental data : for example with the branching ratio @xmath120 .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath121 and @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we would like to get an estimate for the case in which this branching ratio is large , perhaps close to the experimental bound .",
    "we shall make several simpifying assumptions with this in mind .",
    "first , from the expressions for the matrix elements , it can be seen that the largest cross section occurs when the mass splittings between @xmath123 , @xmath83 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are large .",
    "we shall therefore assume that the scalar leptons and neutrinos mix maximally , that is , @xmath126 . also we assume maximal mass splitting for the scalar leptons and sneutrinos ,",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are relatively light , but @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are very heavy , and therefore decouple .",
    "second , the cross section will be smallest for the lightest allowable supersymmetric partners . as the mass of any particle becomes large , the contributions from the subprocesses involving that particle become negligibly small .    since leptonic masses are taken to be small compared to that of their supersymmetric partners , the terms proportional to lepton masses arising from the higgsino component of a vertex ( either chargino or neutralino )",
    "can be ignored .",
    "we base our estimates for chargino and neutralino masses and mixing matrices on previous work done on the subject .",
    "for completness , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "it suffices to mention here that both chargino and neutralino masses , as well as their mixing matrices depend on the following parameters : @xmath135 , the left - handed gaugino mass parameter , @xmath136,the right - handed gaugino mass parameter , @xmath137 , the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath138 .",
    "in addition the cross section will depend on the mass of the @xmath139 which is otherwise unrestricted .",
    "we shall examine the cross section as a function of all the masses , which is more illuminating than a function of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath140 . for simplification we will take @xmath141 in all our considerations .",
    "to get a feeling for the size of the supersymmetric contributions we first choose an  unbroken supersymmetry \" limit , in which the first two neutralinos are degenerate in mass with the photon and @xmath49 boson , the first two charginos are degenerate in mass with the @xmath39 boson , all the  1 \" scalar leptons and scalar neurinos have the same mass , and all the other supersymmetric particles are much heavier and decouple .",
    "the only supersymmetry breaking terms are explicit mass terms for the scalar leptons and neutrinos .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it can bee seen that for light scalar partners in this idealized scenario , the branching ratio @xmath142 can reach values close to the experimental limits .    after getting a rough estimate for the size of the branching ratio , we analyse the effects of varying one of the masses while keeping the others constant .",
    "we do this to investigate the dependence of the branching ratio on the chargino and neutralino masses , as well as scalar leptons and scalar neutrino masses .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the light mass region of the supersymmetric particles in the hope that effects measured there could be noticeable .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the dependence of the branching ratio on the chargino and neutralino masses .",
    "it is impossible to treat separately the chargino and neutralino masses , since as explained above , they depend on the same set of parameters . to simplify",
    ", we consider the influence of the lightest two charginos .",
    "taking @xmath143 to be the variable , we see that as expected , the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath143 and could reach @xmath144 for all masses being at their lowest experimental bound .",
    "( we could have chosen in much the same way to plot the dependence of the branching ratio on the lightest neutralino mass @xmath145 ) .",
    "in many models the first neutralino ( the photino ) is assumed to be the lsp and its mass is restricted to be @xmath146 ; such values can be obtained in the @xmath10 model and are consistent with fig .",
    "the cross section again can reach values close to the experimental bounds .",
    "4 shows the dependence of the cross section on the scalar neutrino masses .",
    "( assuming the left and right scalar neutrinos to be degenerate in mass ) .",
    "we also take the left and right scalar leptons to be degenerate in mass around @xmath147 .",
    "this is for the purpose of increasing the total cross section , since the right - handed sleptons contribute only to @xmath148 and the left - handed ones only to @xmath93 .",
    "again , these are idealized assumptions , the cross section varies weakly with these masses , but it can reach values near the experimental bounds .",
    "the most interesing dependence is perhaps the one on the mass of the doubly - charged @xmath149 higgsino .",
    "this chargino does not mix with other ones because of its charge , and it can significantly increase the branching ratio @xmath150 through scalar - leptons - scalar - leptons loops , as well as through the self energy graphs . the dependence of the cross section on the mass of the @xmath149 is shown in fig .  5 . the branching ratio can exceed the experimental limits unless the mass of the @xmath149 is larger than 120 gev .",
    "this seems to be the only definite restriction of this analysis .",
    "it seems to persist even when @xmath140 is varied(in the region 2 to 5 ) .",
    "when @xmath140 varies , the chargino and neutralino masses become large and their contribution smaller , but this is offset by an increase in the contribution from the @xmath149 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the left - right supersymmetric model , unlike the @xmath11 , can give significant contributions to lepton - number - violating decays of the @xmath49-boson , especially for light ( near experimental bounds ) charginos and neutralinos .",
    "it seems possible to observe such a decay rate at slc , even if the only contribution to these decays arises from slepton and sneutrino mixing .",
    "the present limits on the masses and leptonic decays seem to restrict the mass of the doubly - charged higgsino to at least 120 gev .",
