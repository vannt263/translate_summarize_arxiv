    "the importance of transport and mixing processes in the physical sciences can not be overestimated .",
    "applications abound in the geophysical sciences such as oceanography , atmospheric science , and geology , as well as in astrophysics , chemistry , and general fluid dynamics .",
    "because it spans so many disciplines , a comprehensive understanding of the detailed manner in which mixing proceeds is of paramount importance .    in most physically relevant applications",
    "it is the case that the mixing ( diffusion ) process depends on the stirring ( advection ) phase to create large gradients that then allow diffusion to act . without some form of enhanced stirring",
    ", diffusion is powerless in the face of weak gradients .",
    "the enhancement may be provided by turbulence in the flow , but that is not necessary : for even simple laminar flows , fluid trajectories can display sensitivity to initial conditions ( chaos ) that stretches fluid elements exponentially  a phenomenon termed _ chaotic advection _  @xcite .",
    "this stretching produces the necessary large gradients of the advected quantity , leading to chaotic mixing",
    ". our focus will be on such smooth , chaotic flows .",
    "there are two main results in this paper .",
    "first , we show that the advection  diffusion equation  in lagrangian coordinates can be reduced to a one - dimensional diffusion equation along the stable manifold of the flow ( the direction along which fluid elements are compressed ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the reduced equation grows exponentially in time , reflecting the enhancement to diffusion due to chaotic trajectories ; the reduced equation itself is an approximation valid to exponential accuracy in time .",
    "the enhancement to diffusion is not uniform along the stable manifold : the amount of stretching of fluid elements is anticorrelated with the curvature of the stable manifold  @xcite .",
    "the second result is that this approximate , one - dimensional , equation breaks down after a certain time because of a buildup of large gradients along the neglected direction of stretching . by that time , a significant fraction of the scalar variance has decayed , so the one - dimensional equation is often sufficient for describing physical systems .",
    "in the present section we give an account of the manner in which the advection  diffusion equationexpressed in lagrangian coordinates can be collapsed to a one - dimensional diffusion equation .",
    "the result holds regardless of dimension ( two , three , or more as can arise in kinetic equations ) , and the approximations involved are accurate to order  @xmath0 , where the pclet  number is  @xmath1 , with  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 characteristic spatial and velocity scales , and  @xmath4 the diffusivity ; in many common problems ,  @xmath5 . though it has been realized for some time that the enhanced diffusion proceeds along the stable ( contracting ) direction in both smooth  @xcite and turbulent  @xcite flows , here we make a series of approximations and use a geometrical constraint  @xcite to rewrite the advection ",
    "diffusion equationas an actual one - dimensional diffusion equation along the stable manifold .",
    "this is more than mere formalism , because it allows the identification of the role of invariant structures of the flow in the mixing process ( section  [ sec : phys1d ] ) .",
    "solving the one - dimensional equation also allows us to show that it must eventually break down ( section  [ sec : breakdown ] ) .",
    "the advection ",
    "diffusion equation  for a compressible velocity field  @xmath6 on an  @xmath7-dimensional bounded domain is @xmath8 where the scalar field  @xmath9 is the concentration of the quantity advected , @xmath10 is the diffusivity tensor , and  @xmath11 is the density of the fluid ( which satisfies the continuity equation ) .",
    "the advected scalar  @xmath12 can represent for example temperature , salinity , or the concentration of a solute such as helium .",
    "the velocity field  @xmath13 can be obtained by solving the navier  stokes equation , or it can be a model system designed to mimic the qualitative features of a realistic flow .",
    "the trajectory of a fluid element is given by the solution  @xmath14 to @xmath15 so that  @xmath14 is the coordinate transformation at time  @xmath16 from the comoving lagrangian ( @xmath17 ) to stationary eulerian ( @xmath18 ) coordinates .",
    "for smooth velocity fields , the transformation is smooth and invertible .    by construction , in lagrangian coordinates the advection term drops out , and the advection ",
    "diffusion equation   takes the form @xmath19 where  @xmath20 subscripts denote lagrangian quantities : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , , and @xmath23 where the tangent map ( or jacobian )  @xmath24 has components  .",
    "the  @xmath17 subscript on the time derivative in   is a reminder that the derivative is taken with  @xmath17 held fixed , as opposed to the derivative in   which has  @xmath18 fixed .",
    "the covariance of   and   ( _ i.e. _ , the form of the right - hand side of both equations is the same ) suggests the definition of a metric @xmath25 on the tangent space at  @xmath18 , where the dimensional function  @xmath26 is chosen such that  @xmath27 .",
    "( for constant  @xmath28 , @xmath29 is also constant . )",
    "the metric  @xmath30 is a proper riemannian metric , since it is symmetric and positive - definite ; it induces a metric  @xmath31 on the tangent space at  @xmath17 , @xmath32 because it is symmetric and positive - definite , the metric  @xmath33 can be written in terms of its real - positive eigenvalues  @xmath34 and orthonormal eigenvectors  @xmath35 as @xmath36 the  @xmath37 are called _ coefficients of expansion _ ; without loss of generality , they are ordered such that  . for a very wide class of flows , including incompressible flows ,  @xmath38 ( the smallest coefficient of expansion ) is associated with an exponentially contracting direction , so that  .",
    "the characteristic directions  @xmath39 converge exponentially to their time - asymptotic values  @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the direction of fastest contraction ( @xmath41 ) plays a distinguished role in our development , so we emphasize its importance by denoting it by the letter  ` @xmath42 ' ( for `` stable '' ) .",
    "thus ,  @xmath43 and  @xmath38 are written  @xmath44 and  @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , we will later use the letters  ` @xmath46 ' ( for `` unstable '' ) for the direction of fastest stretching ( @xmath47 ) ; for three - dimensional systems , we use  ` @xmath48 ' ( for `` median '' ) when referring to direction  @xmath49 , which may be stretching , contracting , or neutral .    replacing  @xmath50 by  @xmath51 using  , and substituting the diagonal form   of the metric into",
    ", we find @xmath52 since  , for short times the right - hand side of   can be neglected completely .",
    "however , in a chaotic flow , at least some of the  @xmath53 achieve exponential behavior after a moderate time and can overcome the small diffusivity . because the inverse of  @xmath53 enters  , the direction of fastest contraction  @xmath54 dominates , and eventually we have  . assuming this occurs roughly at time @xmath55 after which we can approximate   by @xmath56 the relative error we are making",
    "if we neglect the  @xmath57 terms is of order  @xmath58 .",
    "since  @xmath59 is assumed very large , by the time   the coefficient of expansion  @xmath45 is well into the exponential regime , and we have  @xmath60 , if the two coefficients are exponentially separated .",
    "thus , for the approximation   to hold , it is sufficient to require that the two smallest lyapunov exponents differ , which we assume to be the case . in a  3d  autonomous flow , we have  @xmath61 because of the presence of a zero lyapunov exponent  @xcite .",
    "hence , the relative error in   is of order  . for a 2d  time - dependent flow ,",
    "the error is even smaller , being of order  .",
    "we conclude that in most physically relevant applications the neglect of the higher - order terms in   is correct to a very high degree of accuracy .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : breakdown ] we will show that this neglect is not justified for long times .    physically ,",
    "the leading - order term in   reflects the enhanced diffusion due to the presence of a dominant contracting direction : along that direction huge gradients are created by the stretching and folding action of the flow , leading to an exponential increase in the efficiency of diffusion . for all practical purposes the other directions can be ignored , as long as the smallest lyapunov exponents are nondegenerate , as assumed .",
    "since the eigenvector  @xmath44 converges to its asymptotic value  @xmath62 at a rate  @xmath63  @xcite , we may replace  @xmath64 in   by  @xmath65 .",
    "the error committed is proportional to  @xmath66 , larger than the order  @xmath67 error in  .",
    "the characteristic direction  @xmath65 can be integrated to yield the",
    "_ stable manifold _",
    "@xmath68 ( or  @xmath44-line ) through a point  @xmath69 , @xmath70 where  @xmath71 denotes the arc length along the stable manifold .",
    "the stable manifold is central to our development , and we will reformulate   so that it represents a diffusion equation along this manifold .    to achieve this goal two more approximations are needed .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that   converges exponentially to a time - independent function , at a rate  @xmath72 .",
    "this convergence implies that , along an  @xmath44-line  given by  @xmath68 , we can choose an arbitrary reference point  @xmath73 and express the time - dependence of  @xmath74 as @xmath75 where  @xmath17 and  @xmath69 are on the same  @xmath44-line  and  @xmath76 is a time - independent function . we will discuss the physical significance of the function  @xmath76 , which we call the parallel coefficient of expansion , in section  [ sec : phys1d ] . neglecting the time - dependence of @xmath76 does not increase the overall error .",
    "we now rewrite   as @xmath77 where we have defined @xmath78 in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that for a chaotic flow in any number of dimensions ,  @xmath79 must satisfy the constraint @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the covariant divergence of  @xmath79  @xcite . upon using the constraint   in  ,",
    "we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 and  @xmath84 is defined analogously to  @xmath76 in  , @xmath85 the decomposition   is possible because the derivative of the metric determinant along the  @xmath44-line  converges exponentially to a time - independent value  @xcite .",
    "the factor  @xmath86 in  @xmath87 arises from the metric determinant in the covariant divergence  , and is absent in incompressible flows .",
    "thus , after all the approximations have been made , the overall error is proportional to  @xmath88 , which scales as  @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we define a derivative along  @xmath79 , @xmath89 where  @xmath90 is a new parameter along the  @xmath44-line  that differs from the arc length  @xmath71 because of the weight  @xmath91 in  .",
    "equation   then achieves the simple form @xmath92 equation   is a one - dimensional diffusion equation along a line defined by  @xmath93 .",
    "the effective diffusivity  @xmath94 diverges exponentially in time , so that even for a microscopic physical diffusivity  @xmath29 the gradients along  @xmath79 are eventually smoothed .",
    "note that it is only in terms of the parameter  @xmath90 that we obtain a one - dimensional diffusion equation ; in terms of any other parameter ( other than a uniform rescaling of  @xmath90 ) , equation   contains a `` drift '' term proportional to  @xmath95 .",
    "we now address the physical meaning of the various constituents of the one - dimensional diffusion equation  .",
    "the essence of the simplification in section  [ sec : derivation1d ] lies in expressing the advection ",
    "diffusion equationin lagrangian coordinates in terms of a single parameter along a stable manifold : with an appropriate choice of parameter , namely  @xmath90 , the equation collapses to a simple diffusion equation .",
    "there are three main ingredients involved in the one - dimensional equation  : ( i ) the exponential part of the coefficient of expansion ,  @xmath96 ; ( ii ) the stable manifold ,  @xmath68 ; and ( iii ) the parallel coefficient of expansion ,  @xmath76 .",
    "we discuss each in turn .    *",
    "( i ) * the exponential part of the coefficient of expansion ,  @xmath96 , is responsible for the enhanced diffusion coefficient  @xmath97 .",
    "the variation of the function  @xmath45 across  @xmath44-lines along unstable directions is very steep ( see section  [ sec : breakdown ] ) and is the cause of the poor convergence of lyapunov exponents  @xcite .",
    "thus , the diffusion rates on two neighboring  @xmath44-lines can be quite different in magnitude , though similar in character because  @xmath96 is independent of  @xmath90 and so gives only a time - dependent overall scaling of the diffusion coefficient in  .",
    "* ( ii ) * the  @xmath44-line  is straightforward to compute  @xcite ; it has a fine structure and densely fills an ergodic region .",
    "if we treat the stable manifold as a material line to be advected by the flow , then the elements on that line will converge exponentially together as  @xmath98 .",
    "thus , if these initial elements carry different concentrations of  @xmath12 , the gradients of  @xmath12 will grow exponentially along these trajectories .",
    "it is thus natural for the stable manifold to play a central role in the chaotic mixing process .",
    "in fact , it is the capacity of the stable manifold to fill an entire chaotic region that allows for a thorough mixing  @xcite .    when evolved _",
    "backward _ in time , a small `` test parcel '' ( of a scale comparable to the length at which dissipation acts ) will be stretched and folded and will give a filament of fluid that samples the initial data  @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "this filament will tend to trace out the stable manifold .",
    "this is the lagrangian analogue of the phenomenon of `` asymptotic directionality '' invoked to discuss the behavior of a material line as it is evolved forward in time by a flow  @xcite .    *",
    "( iii ) * the parallel coefficient of expansion  @xmath76 , also has deep implications for chaotic mixing .",
    "the time - dependent part of  @xmath45 , whose role was explored in  ( i ) above , is uniform on an  @xmath44-line .",
    "in contrast , the parallel coefficient of expansion  @xmath76 is constant in time ( though it depends on  @xmath100 for unsteady flows ) but varies along the stable manifold .",
    "since the full coefficient of expansion  @xmath45 gives the rate of contraction of an initial infinitesimal ellipsoid , we must regard  @xmath76 as a _ deviation _ from the reference rate of contraction given by  @xmath96 .",
    "thus , regions of anomalously large  @xmath76 are associated with fluid elements that contract slower than other elements on the same  @xmath44-line .",
    "the size of  @xmath76 has an impact on diffusion , because the enhanced diffusion is due to the contraction of fluid elements .",
    "the effect is embodied in  @xmath101 : because of   and  , we have  , where  @xmath71 is the arc length along  @xmath62 . hence , in regions of large  @xmath76 , gradients of  @xmath99 are _ smaller _ when expressed in the coordinate  @xmath90 ; the reverse is true for regions of small  @xmath76 .",
    "a large value of  @xmath76 is thus a hindrance to diffusion .",
    "but what range of values does  @xmath76 achieve ?",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : lamt_vs_tauh ] we plot  @xmath102 against the arc length  @xmath71 on an  @xmath44-line .",
    "the cellular flow of solomon and gollub  @xcite is used in the computation ( with parameter values  @xmath103 ) ; it is meant to mimic a chain of oscillating convection rolls .",
    "the parallel coefficient of expansion  @xmath76 is seen to vary over five orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , there exist many exceptional fluid elements that have very slow rates of contraction .",
    "the important factor , then , is how frequently these large values of  @xmath76 occur along the  @xmath44-line .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdflamt ] shows the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of  @xmath102 along two  @xmath44-lines : the tail of the distribution is clearly an exponential , decaying as  @xmath104 .",
    "this is surprising because for this flow the distribution of the finite - time lyapunov exponents themselves has a gaussian tail , as opposed to a `` fat '' ( exponential ) tail .",
    "in fact , we have observed the  @xmath105 exponential law for the tail of the distribution in several flows , even flows such as the random wave flow  @xcite ( also known as the sine flow ) that have no kam regions .",
    "thus , the anomalously large values of  @xmath76 can not only be due to sticking to kam surfaces , though that is certainly a factor .",
    "rather , there are inherent paths in the flow that fluid elements can follow to avoid stretching , and every `` final '' fluid element contains a mixture of such paths . that the tails of the pdf of  @xmath102 fall off exponentially rather than as a gaussian suggests that these exceptional events are important to the long - time decay of scalar variance , in the same manner that the initial alignment of the scalar gradient along the  @xmath44-line  matters .",
    "the statistics of these regions of low stretching is related to the distribution of curvature of material lines  @xcite .",
    "we now show that the neglect of the higher - order terms in   is not justified for long times , a fact we believe has not been appreciated before . to do that",
    ", we compare the magnitude of the terms that were neglected in going from   to   and show that they become important after a certain time . to simplify the argument , we assume the flow is incompressible , and that the diffusivity  @xmath29 is constant in space and time , so that  @xmath97 in   is constant along the @xmath44-line  and depends only on which particular stable manifold we are dealing with [ see  ( i ) in section  [ sec : phys1d ] ] .",
    "we label the dependence on the particular manifold under consideration by a parameter  @xmath106 , meant to represent displacements along an unstable ( stretching ) direction  @xmath107 of the flow . for an initial condition   ( we set the initial time  @xmath100 to zero )",
    ", the one - dimensional diffusion equation   has solution @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the time - average of  @xmath110 . from eq .  ,  @xmath97 is proportional to  , so   gives a _ superexponential _ decay of  @xmath99 .",
    "consider now the variation of  @xmath111 along the unstable direction  @xmath107 , @xmath112 where  @xmath113 . the second derivative of  @xmath111 is @xmath114{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\phi}}_0}}.    \\label{eq : pdu2advsc}\\ ] ] keeping only the first term in   ( the second term does not dominate ) , we take the ratio of the  @xmath47 ( unstable direction ) term to the  @xmath115 ( stable direction ) term in  , @xmath116 the ratio  @xmath117 must be small to justify the approximation leading from   to  . because  @xmath97 grows exponentially",
    ", we have  , so that @xmath118 since  @xmath45 is in the exponential regime , we have that  @xcite @xmath119 where  @xmath120 is a function of space and has only algebraic behavior in time : it neither grows nor decays exponentially in time .",
    "the exponential growth in   is a reflection of the exponential separation of fluid trajectories in the chaotic flow .",
    "equation   applies for almost all initial conditions in essentially all smooth flows and maps ( it is sufficient that the velocity field be thrice - differentiable  @xcite ) , except in highly exceptional cases such as uniformly stretching systems ( e.g. , arnold s cat map , or flow around a hyperbolic point ) , for which  @xmath121 ; the superexponential solution   then persists forever .    after inserting   in  ,",
    "we obtain finally @xmath122 assuming that  @xmath123 , we conclude that  @xmath117 becomes  @xmath124 at time @xmath125 where  @xmath126 is the time where diffusion sets in , defined by  .    in three dimensions , we must take into account the   ( the ` @xmath127 ' or ` median ' direction ) term in  .",
    "its role depends on the type of direction it represents .",
    "if it is a stretching or neutral direction , then the estimate presented above holds , and diffusion along the  @xmath49 direction becomes important at roughly the same time  @xmath128 given by  . if   is a contracting direction , we must modify the asymptotic behavior   to  , as described in  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a time  , after which the  @xmath49 term in   can no longer be neglected .",
    "depending on the magnitude of  @xmath129 , @xmath130 may come before or after  @xmath128 .",
    "the breakdown of   thus occurs at  @xmath131 , which we will simply call  @xmath128 . in two dimensions ,",
    "we ignore  @xmath130 because there is no median direction .",
    "the overall picture is thus as follows . for time",
    ", @xmath99 is approximatively constant because the exponential growth of gradients has not yet overcome the small diffusivity . for  , eq",
    ".   applies and the scalar variance decays superexpontially . for  , the neglect of the   ( and  @xmath49 in  3d ) terms in   is no longer justified , and the one - dimensional diffusion equation   must be abandoned : to characterize the advection ",
    "diffusion process , the full eq .   must be solved .",
    "the reason that the diffusion along  @xmath107 can not be neglected after  @xmath128 is that the tiny , exponentially - decaying effective diffusivity associated with  @xmath107 allows the creation of extremely large gradients of  @xmath99 along that direction .",
    "these gradients are a consequence of the superexponential solution  .",
    "eventually , the gradients overcome the exponentially - decaying effective diffusivity .",
    "in essence , the superexponential solution contains the seeds of its own destruction : the superexponentiality comes from the factor  @xmath132 in  , but that factor exhibits extremely rapid variation along the stretching direction , with no diffusivity to oppose it ( until  @xmath133 ) .    the breakdown of the one - dimensional equation helps to understand a discrepancy between the superexponential decay predicted by that equation and the observed exponential decay of the scalar variance in typical chaotic and turbulent flows . in ref .",
    "@xcite a superexponential decay was derived for individual fluid trajectories , and an exponential decay was recovered by averaging over the initial angle between the scalar gradient and the stable direction .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the decay of the variance in the ( nonuniform ) baker s map is exponential for long times , even though in their case the angle between the scalar gradient and the stable direction is always zero , so that no averaging can be done .",
    "our demonstration of the termination of the superexponential regime after some time shows that there is hope of restoring the more appropriate , exponential decay of the variance , but we have yet to show this because a technique of solution for the eq .   must be found .",
    "for the kraichnan  kazantsev model of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence ( delta - correlated in time ) , the decay of variance is known to be exponential  @xcite , though the predicted rate is too rapid when compared with nonhomogeneous systems  @xcite which can have slowly - decaying eigenfunctions .    even though it ceases to be valid after some time , the one - dimensional equation is still relevant , because during the time   a very large fraction of the variance can get dissipated , owing to the very fast decay of the superexponential .",
