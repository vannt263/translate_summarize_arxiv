    "a honeycomb lattice is not a bravais lattice @xcite , which makes it fundamentally different from the hexagonal lattice @xcite . in recent years",
    ", honeycomb lattices in different physical systems @xcite have attracted an increased attention from research community .",
    "an especially interesting development occurred when it was realized that photonic topological insulators can be produced in honeycomb lattices @xcite .",
    "floquet topological insulators can confine the propagating light beam at the edges without scattering energy into the bulk , thus becoming robust against scattering from defects .",
    "such useful properties result from the topologically protected edge states , which are mainly determined by the topological structure in the momentum space and are protected by the symmetry .",
    "the edge states are quite stable and independent of the surface structure of the material @xcite .",
    "recently , unconventional edge states @xcite and pseudospin @xcite of honeycomb lattices have also been demonstrated .",
    "the novel findings related to honeycomb lattices , as well as photonic topological insulators , can have potential applications in quantum computing @xcite , optical modulators @xcite and optical diodes @xcite .",
    "honeycomb lattices can be conveniently formed by the femtosecond laser writing technique or by the optically induced method .",
    "the first method is exclusively used in solid materials @xcite , while the second method can be used in both solid @xcite and gaseous @xcite materials .    as far as we know , honeycomb lattices are mostly investigated in solid materials @xcite .",
    "in addition to solid materials , honeycomb lattices are also reported in gaseous materials @xcite .",
    "however , some extra conditions are required for the hexagonal lattice to form in such materials . in atomic vapors , when the three - beam interference pattern serves as the dressing field , the dressed atomic states will exhibit controllable optical properties . in the last decade , periodically dressed atomic vapors  such as rubidium vapor  were intensively investigated , leading to the observation of many interesting effects , including enhanced multi - wave mixing ( mwm ) signals due to bragg reflection of photonic band gap ( pbg ) structures @xcite . also , the talbot effect of mwm @xcite and the nonreciprocity of light @xcite have been explored , to name a few interesting effects .    in this paper , we investigate the influence of frequency detunings and the power of coupling fields on the topology of the photonic band structure of honeycomb lattices that are induced in atomic vapors through the three - beam interference method .",
    "we would like to point out that the investigation carried out in this paper can be extended to explore the generation of topological insulators in atomic vapor ensembles @xcite and also applied to on - chip crystals , such as praseodymium doped yttrium orthosilicate ( pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 ) crystal @xcite , which exhibits similar properties to those of atomic vapors .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the theoretical model . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present the results , which include the changes in the refractive index ( ri ) of the material in subsec .",
    "[ first ] and in the corresponding pbg structures in subsec .",
    "section [ discussion ] explores an explanation of the results and demonstrates how frequency detunings affect the topology of pbg structures . in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] , we conclude the paper .",
    "we start from a @xmath3-type electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) system @xcite , as depicted in fig . [ fig1](a ) . in the figure",
    ", the probe field @xmath4 connects the transition @xmath5 , and the coupling field @xmath6 connects the transition @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that there are three broad coupling fields at the same frequency .",
    "the three coupling fields are launched into the medium in parallel and propagate paraxially along the same direction @xmath8 , with the angle @xmath9 between any two of them .",
    "therefore , they form the two - dimensional hexagonal interference pattern in the transverse @xmath10 plane . such an optically - induced hexagonal lattice can be written in the form : @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the wave number @xmath15 corresponds to the coupling fields , and @xmath16 represents the rabi frequency of the coupling fields , defined as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the electric dipole moment .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath19.\\ ] ] since level @xmath20 is dressed by the coupling fields , it will split into two sublevels @xmath21 and @xmath22 as shown by the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , with the eigenfrequencies @xmath23 according to the eigenvalue relation @xmath24 , where the hamiltonian @xcite is @xmath25 since the interference pattern of the dressing fields is hexagonal , the sublevels @xmath21 and @xmath22 split from @xmath20 by such a dressing field will be periodic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and in the inset panels , in which the grid represents the original level @xmath20 .",
    "one can see that the sublevels @xmath21 and @xmath22 exhibit hexagonal and honeycomb profiles , respectively .    due to the periodicity of the dressing field , the susceptibility will also be periodic .",
    "in general , the susceptibility in an atomic vapor can be written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the atomic density , @xmath28 the electric dipole moment , @xmath29 the permittivity in vacuum , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 the complex decay rates . here , @xmath32 are the decay rates between @xmath33 and @xmath34 states , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the detunings .",
    "they are determined by the transition frequencies @xmath37 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and by the frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the probe and the coupling fields .",
    "the derivation of the eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can be found in the appendix .",
    "we note that higher - order susceptibilities should be considered when the intensity of @xmath6 is high enough @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will stay at relatively low intensities and therefore , only consider the first - order susceptibility @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the absorption of the system , which is indicated in eq .",

    "the bottom two panels are the top views of the split sublevels @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . ]",
    "the propagation of the probe beam in the medium , in the paraxial approximation , is described by the wave equation for the envelope of the optical electric field , which is equivalent to the following schrdinger equation @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the field envelope of the probe beam , @xmath45 is the transverse laplacian , and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is the `` effective potential '' coming from the change in the refractive index , induced by the coupling fields according to eqs .",

    "furthermore , @xmath47 is the potential depth and @xmath48 is the wavenumber of the probe , with @xmath49 being the wavelength . in atomic vapors ,",
    "the ambient refractive index is @xmath50 .",
    "we should note that the minimum of the `` potential '' , which is the maximum of the refractive index change , corresponds to the lattice site .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we display the lowest three bands . in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a)-[fig3](j ) , one can see that the pbg structure contains 6 dirac cones ( between the upper two bands ) at the vertices of the first brillouin zone , and the dispersion relation is linear around the dirac points . corresponding to fig .",

    "[ fig3](k ) , in which the edges of the upper two bands merge with each other and dirac cones disappear in the pbg . however , the pbg structures shown in figs . [ fig3](l)-[fig3](r ) , which correspond to figs . [",

    "[ fig3](a)-[fig3](j ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig3](l)-[fig3](r ) , a big band gap opens between the upper two bands , so that the dirac cones disappear .",
    "when the frequency detuning increases further , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](s)-[fig3](u ) , the upper two bands become almost degenerate and flat , and there is a big band gap between the upper two bands and the bottom band .",
    "when the upper two bands in figs .",
    "[ fig3](s)-[fig3](u ) are zoomed in , as shown in the insets , one can find that there are still 6 dirac points at the vertices of the first brillouin zone .",
    "one has to take into account that the difference in height of the upper two bands is too small to recognize the cones , in comparison with the big band gap .",
    "therefore , even if the edges of the upper two bands seemingly merge with each other , there are still dirac cones visible @xcite at the 6 corners of the first brillouin zone . in other words , even though @xmath57 in figs .",
    "[ fig3](l)-[fig3](u ) , the pbg topology in figs .",
    "[ fig3](s)-[fig3](u ) is different from those in figs .",
    "[ fig3](l)-[fig3](r ) , and is similar to some extent to the cases in figs .",
    "[ fig3](f)-[fig3](j ) , where @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] clearly exhibits the influence of frequency detunings on the topology of the pbg structure , especially in figs . [ fig3](r ) and [ fig3](s ) . in order to perceive evolution of the topology of the pbg structure",
    ", we also display the cases in - between figs .",
    "[ fig3](r ) and [ fig3](s ) , as shown in fig .",
    "we would like to note that even though the transition between figs .",
    "[ fig3](j)-[fig3](l ) is quite abrupt , the change is continuous , so it does not provide additional information .",
    "hence , we do not show the intermediate stages . at the 6 corners of the first brillouin zone ,",
    "the gaps between the upper two bands decrease and then merge together , while the opposite is observed for the bottom two bands .",
    "one finds that such a `` transition '' happens at a certain detuning  the one shown in fig . [ fig4](d ) .",
    "what is the physical reason behind such a pbg modulation ? in this section , we answer this question .",
    "since the pbg structure reflects the property of the changing ri , it is natural to go back to the ri change and find the explanation .    in order to see the trend in the ri change with the frequency detuning more clearly",
    ", we display the ri change in the @xmath59 plane versus @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , while in figs .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) , we show the ri change in the @xmath59 plane corresponding to figs . [ fig2](f ) and [ fig2](p ) . as stated in the previous literature @xcite , a honeycomb lattice demands the ri at the lattice sites to be bigger than the ambient ri .",
    "however , a more complex situation is encountered around honeycomb sites in an atomic vapor .",
    "consequently , the cases with @xmath56 and @xmath42 have to be discussed separately .",
    "this is done in the following two subsections .",
    "as mentioned , the ri at the sites is then the smallest .",
    "however , the ri immediately around the sites is the biggest , and it forms a honeycomb lattice . in other words , the honeycomb lattice is composed of small triangular structures",
    " one can observe such lattices in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a)-[fig2](j ) . for this case",
    ", the honeycomb lattice sites should properly refer to these triangular structures . in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) , one can see the distance between the two nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites ( two peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) , and this distance can not block the hopping between the two sites ; therefore one can observe the dirac cones in the pbg structure .",
    "with the increasing frequency detuning , the distance increases and broadens , which makes the hopping more difficult ; as a result , the topology of the pbg structure is affected  the heights of the upper two bands shrink , even though there are still dirac points .      when @xmath57 , the ri change at the sites is the biggest ; therefore , the sites directly form a honeycomb lattice , as shown in figs . [",
    "fig2](l)-[fig2](u ) , which is substantially different from the @xmath56 case . from figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](c ) , one can observe the appearance of a `` potential barrier '' between the two nn sites .",
    "such a barrier does not exist in the case @xmath56 , because the ri change is always the highest around the sites , and the ri change between the two peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , monotonously decreases and then monotonously increases along the positive @xmath61 direction ( that is , there is no potential barrier ) .     versus different frequency detunings .",
    "( b ) ri change corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig2](f ) , as a color plot in the @xmath62 plane , with @xmath63 along the @xmath64 line plotted explicitly on the vertical axis .",
    "( c ) same as ( b ) , but corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig2](p ) . ]",
    "the existence of the barrier blocks the hopping effectively , so that no dirac cone forms in the pbg structure .",
    "we call this phenomenon in the pbg topology the `` _ _ blockage effect _ _ '' . with an increasing frequency detuning",
    "the barrier decreases , and the blockage effect also weakens .",
    "numerical simulation demonstrates that the blockage effect disappears at about @xmath65 mhz , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) . without the blockage effect ,",
    "the hopping between nn sites happens , and correspondingly there appear dirac cones between the upper two bands in the pbg structure , as shown in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig3](s)-[fig3](u ) .",
    "since the ri change at the sites is much bigger than the ambient ri change , the hopping strength is relatively weak .",
    "this is the reason why the upper two bands in figs . [",
    "fig3](s)-[fig3](u ) are almost degenerate .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the influence of changing frequency detunings on the topology of the pbg structure of the honeycomb lattice induced in an atomic vapor .",
    "we have illuminated how the appearance and disappearance of dirac points and cones is associated with the change in the sign of the frequency detuning .",
    "this research can be utilized in the construction of topological insulators , but also can be applied to the pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystal , even though it is developed for gaseous systems .",
    "our investigation broadens the understanding of pbg structures of the honeycomb lattice , and may help in fabricating photonic devices that can be used in all - optical signal processing and computing .",
