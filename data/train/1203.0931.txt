    "azimuthal correlations between particles emitted in heavy - ion collisions are a useful observable to probe the behavior of these systems  @xcite . specifically , one measures the fourier coefficient  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the relative azimuthal angle between a pair of particles , and @xmath3 denotes an average over pairs and collisions .",
    "the long - range part of this correlation ( defined by a rapidity gap between the pair ) is mostly generated by collective , anisotropic flow of the strongly - coupled matter created in the collision  @xcite .",
    "the most studied fourier component is @xmath4  @xcite , corresponding to elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "recently it was realized that event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite , generate a whole series of harmonics .",
    "this has triggered detailed analyses of @xmath5 for @xmath6 36  @xcite .",
    "neglected in these analyses is the first fourier harmonic @xmath7 .",
    "the observed @xmath7 is smaller than @xmath4 and @xmath8  @xcite , and receives a sizable contribution from global momentum conservation  @xcite which makes its interpretation less straightforward .",
    "fluctuations are expected to create a dipole asymmetry in the system  @xcite , resulting in a specific directed flow pattern , with high transverse momentum particles flowing in the direction of the steepest gradient and low @xmath9 particles flowing in the opposite direction .",
    "hints of this directed flow have been extracted from published @xmath7 data at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) by two of the authors  @xcite , and its magnitude and @xmath9-dependence were shown to be in agreement with ideal hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "note that this quantity is distinct from the directed flow observable that has been obtained in the past from measurements employing a rapidity - odd projection  @xcite .",
    "that rapidity - odd @xmath0 gives a negligible contribution to @xmath7 near mid - rapidity and represents different physics  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we show that data on @xmath7 obtained by alice  @xcite can be explained by the superposition of two effects : global momentum conservation and directed flow .",
    "this allows for the first reliable measurement of directed flow at mid rapidity .",
    "we then carry out the first viscous hydrodynamic calculation of directed flow , and show that these data can be used to constrain the initial dipole asymmetry of the system for each centrality , putting strong constraints on models of initial conditions .",
    "the standard picture of heavy - ion collisions is that an approximately thermalized fluid is created , which eventually breaks up into particles .",
    "particles are emitted independently in each event , with an azimuthal distribution that fluctuates from event to event .",
    "this yields a two - particle correlation which factorizes into the product of two single - particle distributions  @xcite : @xmath10 where the superscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to trigger and associated particles that can be taken from different bins in transverse momentum , and @xmath13 is the anisotropic flow coefficient .",
    "note that it is possible for the event - averaged correlation to not factorize even if independent emission holds in each event  @xcite , and it is also possible for intrinsic ( `` non - flow '' ) pair correlations to factorize  @xcite .",
    "however , flow is currently the only known mechanism that produces a factorized correlation in the range of transverse momentum studied here ( the bulk of particles ) .",
    "this factorization has been tested in pb - pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite : this is done by fitting the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ corrflow ] ) , which is a @xmath14 symmetric matrix for @xmath15 bins in @xmath9 , with the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ corrflow ] ) , using the @xmath15 values of @xmath13 as fit parameters .",
    "the alice collaboration has shown that , while the data do factorize for @xmath16 , this factorization breaks down for @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since there is expected to be an additional long - range correlation induced by momentum conservation that only affects the first harmonic  @xcite .",
    "the constraint that all transverse momenta add up to 0 yields a back - to - back correlation between pairs , which increases linearly with the transverse momenta of both particles .",
    "this correlation adds to the correlation from flow : @xmath18    .[table ] from left to right : @xmath19 per degree of freedom of the fit to the alice @xmath7  @xcite ( restricted to @xmath20  gev/@xmath21 ) using eq .",

    "( [ corrflow ] ) or ( [ corrv1 ] ) .",
    "adding one single fit parameter @xmath22 tremendously increases the quality of the fit for all centrality windows .",
    "we have checked that the values of the fit parameters depend little on the @xmath9 window .",
    "however , the quality of the fit decreases as higher @xmath9 particles are included , as observed for other harmonics  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we include the entire range of values as a systematic uncertainty in table  [ table ] , varying the lower @xmath9 cutoff between 0.250.75 gev , and the upper cutoff between 2.515.0 gev .",
    "similarly , we use this procedure to estimate a systematic uncertainty in @xmath0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alicev1 ] below ) .",
    "next , we check whether the value of @xmath22 from the fit is compatible with the value expected from momentum conservation . assuming for simplicity that momentum conservation is the only source of correlation , one obtains  @xcite @xmath25 , where the sum runs over all particles emitted in one event , and angular brackets denote an average over events in the centrality class . since experiments measure only charged particles in a restricted phase - space window , only a rough estimate of this quantity can be made , by extrapolating from existing data .",
    "we have used the preliminary identified particle @xmath9 spectra from alice at midrapidity  @xcite , and extrapolated them outside the @xmath9 acceptance of the detector using levy fits  @xcite . in order to extrapolate to all rapidities , we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath9 spectra are independent of rapidity , and we have used the total charged multiplicity estimated by the alice collaboration  @xcite .",
    "neutral particles were taken into account assuming isospin symmetry , and the contribution of particles heavier than nucleons was neglected .",
    "the resulting estimate is shown in the last column of table  [ table ] .",
    "the fit result in general has the correct size and increases with % centrality , as expected .",
    "the centrality dependence is steeper than expected from our rough estimate , however  the fit value is larger than the estimated value for the most peripheral bin , while it is significantly smaller for central collisions .",
    "we can not explain this , but overall the agreement is reasonable , and a discrepancy in @xmath22 of this size has a very small effect on the extracted directed flow ; the extracted directed flow curves with @xmath22 fixed to the estimated values were also included in the systematic error band in @xmath0 , but only have a small effect on the two most central bins .    it has been suggested that the correlation from momentum conservation could be larger than our estimate because of approximate conservation of transverse momentum within smaller subsystems of the entire collision system  specifically rapidity slices of roughly unit extent  @xcite .",
    "however , we see no evidence here for such an enhancement .    thus , by taking into account the only obvious non - flow correlation , the factorization seen in higher harmonics is restored , and we can take the resulting @xmath26 as a reliable measurement of directed flow @xmath0 ( presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : alicev1 ] below ) .",
    "relativistic viscous hydrodynamics has been shown to successfully reproduce @xmath27 for @xmath28  @xcite . here , we present the first viscous hydrodynamic calculation for directed flow , @xmath0 . in hydrodynamics , @xmath0 and the corresponding event - plane angle @xmath29",
    "are defined by @xmath30 , where angular brackets denote an average over the momentum distribution at freeze - out  @xcite .",
    "a collision of identical nuclei at mid - rapidity has @xmath31 symmetry except for fluctuations , hence @xmath0 at midrapidity is solely due to event - by - event fluctuations in the initial state .    in event - by - event ideal hydrodynamic calculations , @xmath0 was found  @xcite to be approximately proportional to the dipole asymmetry of the system @xmath32 defined as  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes an average value over the initial energy density after recentering the coordinate system ( @xmath35 ) .    , scaled by the initial dipole asymmetry @xmath32 , in a central pb - pb collision at 2.76  tev , for different values of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath36 . ]    here , in order to make a systematic study , we use a smooth , symmetric density profile which we deform to introduce a dipole asymmetry of the desired size and orientation .",
    "specifically , our calculation is a 2 + 1 dimensional viscous hydrodynamic calculation which uses as initial condition the transverse energy density ( @xmath37 ) profile from an optical glauber model  @xcite , which is deformed in a way analogous to the previous study of @xmath38 and higher harmonics in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a small parameter .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath32 are proportional to @xmath40 for @xmath41 . for noncentral collisions , @xmath0 depends mildly on the orientation of the dipole asymmetry @xmath42 with respect to the impact parameter .",

    "[ fig : v1hydro ] presents the ratio @xmath43 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath9 for central collisions . unlike higher - order harmonics , which are usually positive for all @xmath9 , @xmath0 changes sign",
    "the reason is that the net transverse momentum of the system is zero by construction , which implies @xmath44 : low-@xmath9 particles tend to flow in the direction opposite to high-@xmath9 particles .",
    "the harmonics @xmath27 tend to probe smaller length scales with increasing @xmath45 , and as a result are expected to have an increasing sensitivity to viscosity .",
    "our results show that , indeed , @xmath0 is less sensitive to viscosity than @xmath46  @xcite and higher harmonics  @xcite .",
    "this insensitivity to viscosity combined with the approximate proportionality @xmath47 provides a unique opportunity to place a direct constraint on the dipole asymmetry of the early - time system .    in a realistic pb - pb collision",
    ", @xmath32 varies from event to event .",
    "the contribution of directed flow to @xmath7 scales like @xmath48 . therefore the experimentally measured @xmath0 scales like the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of @xmath32 in the centrality bin . as we shall see below , there is a wide range of predictions for this quantity . with these new data we can now quickly discern which are compatible with experiment by identifying an allowed range of values for the rms dipole asymmetry .     in pb - pb collisions at 2.76  tev extracted from correlation data  @xcite , in various centrality windows .",
    "the shaded band represents the systematic uncertainty from the choice of @xmath9 window used for the fit .",

    "the magnitude and @xmath9 dependence of @xmath0 are similar at lhc and at rhic  @xcite , and the mild centrality dependence , reminiscent of @xmath38  @xcite , is expected since both are generated purely from fluctuations in the initial state .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath0 in lhc data bears a striking resemblance to that predicted by hydrodynamics , fig .",
    "[ fig : v1hydro ] . in a given centrality window and for a given value of the viscosity",
    ", one can tune the value of the dipole asymmetry @xmath32 in the hydrodynamic calculation so as to obtain reasonable agreement with data . if one chooses to match data at the lowest @xmath9 , calculation overpredicts data at high @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , if one matches data at high @xmath9 , calculation underpredicts data at low @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath32 can be considered upper and lower bounds on the actual value .",
    "the values of @xmath36 ( the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density ) implied by comparisons of elliptic flow data to hydrodynamic calculations all lie in the range @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath36 lies in this range , we can extract an allowed range for the dipole asymmetry , using the extremal values of @xmath36 and @xmath32 that still give a reasonable fit to data .",
    "( the extremal curves used are shown in fig .",

    "the shaded bands indicate the allowed regions using alice data in combination with viscous hydrodynamics , assuming either @xmath49 ( lighter shade ) or @xmath50 ( darker shade ) .",
    "also shown are the prediction of several monte - carlo models of initial conditions : dipsy  @xcite , mc - kln ( obtained from mckt v1.00 )  @xcite , mckt v1.25  @xcite , and two different implementations of the glauber model utilizing point - like nucleons  @xcite or uniform disks @xcite .",
    "the binary collision fraction for both glauber models was taken to be @xmath51  @xcite . ]",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] displays the allowed values of @xmath32 as a function of centrality , together with the rms @xmath32 from various monte - carlo models of initial conditions . the allowed range assuming @xmath50 , representing the most common values extracted from @xmath46 data , are also shown in a darker band , to illustrate the small effect of viscosity .",
    "both the order of magnitude and the centrality dependence of @xmath32 from monte - carlo models resemble the allowed values from lhc data . however , there are significant differences between the models .",
    "lhc data already exclude dipsy  @xcite above 10% centrality , and the phobos glauber model  @xcite as well as a recent improved mckt model with kno fluctuations  @xcite over the entire centrality range .    note , however , that since hydrodynamics is expected to be more reliable at low transverse momentum , the actual value of @xmath32 is most likely to lie very close to our upper bound .",
    "thus it is possible that the two models with the largest dipole asymmetry may only need a slight tuning to achieve a correct value , while the value from the others may in fact be too low .",
    "we prefer here to be conservative in our claimed region of allowed values and leave it to future study for more stringent conclusions .     in au - au collisions at 200 gev in various centrality windows .",
    "]    models such as those presented here do not in general predict a significant change in dipole asymmetry with collision energy . by extracting a best value of @xmath32 from these lhc data combined with hydrodynamic calculations of lower energy collisions ,",
    "we can make predictions for au - au collisions at rhic assuming little change in the average dipole asymmetry in a centrality bin . since the change of @xmath32 with collision energy predicted by each current monte carlo model is much smaller than the range spanned by the various models , this prediction is more reliable than any obtained by assuming a particular model for the initial conditions .",
    "these are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] .",
    "the value of @xmath32 at lhc is obtained by taking the best fit to the experimental @xmath0 for @xmath52  gev / c , which is the range where hydrodynamics agrees best with data  @xcite .",
    "our calculations use @xmath53 both at lhc and at rhic , but the extrapolation from lhc to rhic depends very weakly on the assumed value of @xmath36  @xcite .    these predictions are compatible with the attempted extraction of @xmath0  @xcite from a much more limited set of correlation data at 2060% centrality released by the star collaboration , but a dedicated analysis by one of the experimental collaborations at rhic will allow for a much more precise test , including centrality dependence .",
    "we have shown that the first fourier component of the two - particle azimuthal correlation measured at lhc , @xmath7 , can be explained by collective flow , much in the same way as higher harmonics , after the correlation from momentum conservation is accounted for .",
    "we have thus obtained the first measurement of directed flow , @xmath0 , at midrapidity at the lhc .",
    "this experimental result was compared with the first viscous hydrodynamic calculation of directed flow .",
    "@xmath0 was found to have a weaker dependence on viscosity than @xmath46 and @xmath38 , which allows for the first time a tight constraint to be placed directly on the geometry and fluctuations of the early - time system , and which rules out certain current theoretical models .",
    "the extracted values of the dipole asymmetry of the initial conditions then allow for predictions to be made for directed flow at midrapidity in lower - energy collisions at rhic , which were presented .    for providing experimental data from the alice collaboration we would like to thank andrew adare and mateusz ploskon .",
