    "the study on the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been extended from finite temperature and baryon density to finite isospin density . the physical motivation to study qcd at finite isospin density and the corresponding pion superfluidity",
    "is related to the investigation of compact stars , isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , and heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies . in early studies on dense nuclear matter and compact stars",
    ", it has been suggested that charged pions and even kaons are condensed at sufficiently high density  @xcite .",
    "it is in principle no problem to do lattice simulation at finite isospin density  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that  @xcite there is a phase transition from normal phase to pion superfluidity at a critical isospin chemical potential which is about the pion mass in vacuum , @xmath0 . the qcd phase structure at finite isospin density is also investigated in many low energy effective models , such as chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , random matrix method  @xcite , ladder qcd  @xcite , and strong coupling lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "one of the models that enables us to see directly how the dynamic mechanisms of spontaneous symmetry breaking and restoration operate is the njl model  @xcite applied to quarks  @xcite . in this model , quarks are elementary particles and mesons are quantum fluctuations . at mean field level to quarks and in random phase approximation ( rpa ) to mesons , one can express the fluctuation contribution to the thermodynamics of the quark - meson system in terms of the bound states and scattering phase shifts of quark - antiquark pairs  @xcite .",
    "this result appears to be more general than for just the njl model : it resembles the beth - uhlenbeck formula for the second virial coefficient for a gas of non - relativistic particles  @xcite , and its relativistic generalization by dashen et al .",
    "a non - relativistic approach including medium effects in a nuclear physics content was used by schmidt et al .",
    "recently , the relativistic approach was extended to describe the thermodynamics of color superconductivity by blaschke et al .",
    "@xcite . at finite isospin density , by taking into account all the possible channels in the bubble summation in the rpa , the njl model describes successfully the pion superfluid phase , especially the goldstone mode corresponding to the spontaneous isospin symmetry breaking  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quark - antiquark scattering phase shift and its relation to the meson spectral function in pion superfluid phase in the njl model .",
    "when isospin symmetry is spontaneously broken , the new eigenmodes of the superfluid system are no longer the ordinary mesons with fixed isospin quantum numbers but their linear combinations .",
    "such strong meson mixing makes it impossible to define quark - antiquark scattering phase shift and meson spectral function for a fixed channel , and the whole phase shift and spectral function are not a simple sum of all the possible meson channels .",
    "we will discuss the relation among the meson propagator pole , quark - antiquark scattering phase shift and meson spectral function in the njl model in section [ s2 ] , and show numerical calculations in normal and pion superfluid phases and analyze the physics behind in section [ s3 ] .",
    "finally we summarize in section [ s4 ] .",
    "the lagrangian density of the two flavor njl model at quark level is defined as  @xcite @xmath1\\ ] ] with scalar and pseudoscalar interactions corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 excitations , where @xmath4 is the current quark mass , @xmath5 is the four - quark coupling constant with dimension ( gev)@xmath6 , @xmath7 are the pauli matrices in flavor space , and @xmath8 is the quark chemical potential matrix with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the @xmath11- and @xmath12-quark chemical potentials and @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the baryon and isospin chemical potentials .    at zero isospin chemical potential , the lagrangian density has the symmetry of @xmath15 corresponding respectively to baryon number symmetry , isospin symmetry and chiral symmetry . at finite isospin chemical potential but without pion condensation , the isospin symmetry @xmath16 and chiral symmetry @xmath17 are explicitly broken to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the chiral symmetry restoration at finite isospin chemical potential means only degeneracy of @xmath2 and @xmath20 mesons , the charged @xmath21 and @xmath22 behave still differently .    introducing the chiral and pion condensates @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are the order parameters to describe respectively the spontaneous chiral and isospin symmetry breaking , @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and taking both condensates to be real ,",

    "the two gap equations ( [ gap ] ) determine self - consistently the two order parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 in medium . in chiral limit with vanishing current quark mass @xmath39 , the critical point of chiral symmetry restoration is determined by the first gap equation ( [ gap ] ) at @xmath40 , and the pion superfluid starts at @xmath41 . in real case with @xmath42 , while there is no more strict chiral phase transition , the pion superfluid starts at @xmath43 at @xmath44  @xcite , where @xmath45 is the pion mass in vacuum .",
    "the above treatment at mean field level is clearly incomplete , it misses the meson contribution which should dominate the system at low temperature and chemical potential . in the njl model ,",
    "the meson modes are regarded as quantum fluctuations above the mean field .",
    "the quark - antiquark scattering via meson exchange can be effectively expressed at quark level in terms of quark bubble summation in rpa  @xcite .",
    "considering all the possible quark bubbles between two interaction vertexes , the meson propagator can then be written as a matrix in the meson space @xmath46  @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the meson four momentum with the matsubara frequency @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the meson polarization matrix with elements @xmath51\\ ] ] with the meson vertexes @xmath52 in eq.([element ] ) the quark momentum integration is at finite temperature , and the trace is over color , flavor and spin degrees of freedom of quarks .",

    "the quark propagator is diagonal in flavor space , and therefore all the off - diagonal elements of the polarization matrix @xmath55 in the meson space disappear automatically . in the pion superfluid , while there is no mixing between @xmath20 and other mesons , @xmath56 , the other three mesons @xmath57 and @xmath22 are coupled to each other with nonzero elements @xmath58  @xcite .",

    ", it can be explicitly separated into a meson part and a background part , and the latter is independent of the meson itself and controlled by the quark properties  @xcite .    the meson spectral function",
    "which is also controlled by the complex structure of the meson propagator is closely related to the quark - antiquark scattering phase shift . in the case without meson mixing , the spectral function for the meson @xmath63 in the njl model",

    "this means that in the quark - meson plasma described by the njl model , the meson spectral function is governed by not only the meson characteristics but also the quark properties .",
    "before doing numerical calculations , we first fix the parameters of the model . since there is no confinement in the njl model and the model is non - renormalizable , we should regularize the model . for simplicity , we choose a hard cutoff @xmath68 for the quark three momentum .",

    "the @xmath2 meson is always in the resonant state in the njl model , the width is however rather small in the chiral symmetry breaking phase and increases rapidly when the symmetry is gradually restored .",
    "different from the case at @xmath41 where the three pions are degenerate , the meson mass splitting at @xmath90 leads to different mott phase transition points for different pions .    in the normal phase with only chiral condensation , the quark propagator is diagonal and",
    "the summation of bubbles in rpa selects its specific channel by choosing at each stage the same proper polarization function .",
    "therefore , a meson mode which is determined by the pole of the corresponding meson propagator is related to its own polarization function only .",
