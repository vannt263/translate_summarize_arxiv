    "the concept of an active frequency standard in the optical domain was recently proposed and studied by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to create a `` superradiant '' laser operating deep in the bad cavity regime where the decay rate @xmath0 of the cavity field significantly exceeds the linewidth @xmath1 of the lasing transition .",
    "then the fundamental linewidth @xmath2 of the steady - state operating laser can be described by the generalized schawlow - townes formula that can be written as @xmath3 in the practically interesting range @xmath4  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the difference between the cavity resonance frequency @xmath6 and the frequency @xmath7 of the lasing transition , @xmath8 is the coupling coefficient , @xmath9 is the steady - state occupation of the upper lasing level , @xmath10 is an average number of photons in the cavity mode .",
    "the frequency @xmath11 of the emitted radiation is connected with the resonance frequency @xmath6 of the cavity and with the frequency @xmath12 of the atomic transition via cavity pulling , namely @xmath13 in the bad cavity regime , any fluctuation ( thermal or mechanical ) of the cavity length has much less influence on the spectrum of the output light than in conventional lasers , operating in the good cavity regime .",
    "fluctuations of the cavity length are currently the main limiting factor for the performance and even more for the transportability of modern passive optical frequency standards .",
    "an active optical frequency standard could help to overcome these limitations .",
    "two main approaches towards an active optical frequency standard are proposed today : the _ optical lattice laser _",
    "@xcite and the _ atomic beam laser _",
    "the first approach suggests to use trapped atoms with narrow optical transitions [ such as @xmath14 transitions in divalent atoms ] confined to the lamb - dicke regime inside an optical lattice potential as a gain medium to build the laser .",
    "the necessary population inversion can be provided by additional repumping fields , coupling the lower lasing state with some higher levels from which the atoms decay to the upper lasing level ( three - level laser scheme ) .",
    "the general operation principle of such an optical lattice bad cavity laser has been demonstrated experimentally using a raman system to mimic a narrow linewidth optical transition  @xcite .",
    "the main limitation to the performance of this optical lattice laser is the limited lifetime of the atoms in the optical trap .",
    "a laser whose gain medium is a single ensemble of trapped atoms can not keep the phase longer than the atom trap lifetime .",
    "another problem emerges from the pumping laser which can shift the frequency of the lasing transition .",
    "although the authors of  @xcite claim that ac stark shift - induced fluctuations of the atomic transition frequency are negligible at the mhz level for repumping rates of the order of @xmath15 s@xmath16 and for a pumping laser intensity - stabilized to 1 % , also the frequency of the laser depopulating the low lasing level needs to be quite well stabilized . in @xcite , it is proposed to use a four - level lasing scheme with a non stable lower lasing state to avoid the pumping - induced shift , however this scheme still suffers from the problem of limited trap lifetime .",
    "the atomic beam approach allows us to overcome the atom lifetime limitation .",
    "here , a continuous beam of active atoms , previously pumped to the upper lasing state , passes through the cavity .",
    "the theory of laser generation for this system was presented in  @xcite and the generalization to ramsey - type interaction between the atoms and the intracavity light was performed in  @xcite . in  @xcite the author claimed that laser radiation with @xmath17hz linewidth and 120nw power can be attained with a beam of hot @xmath18sr atoms prepumped to the @xmath19 upper lasing state ( natural linewidth 7.6khz ) , with a cavity of 800@xmath20 m waist and @xmath21mhz .",
    "the flux required for the lasing is @xmath22 atoms per second . at the same time",
    ", the theory developed in  @xcite does not take into account the motion of the atoms along the cavity axis while passing through the resonator .",
    "this motion will lead to additional line broadening and a first - order doppler shift .",
    "the latter will fluctuate together with the mean transversal atomic velocity which depends on the environment , thermal fluctuation of the nozzle etc .",
    "accurate compensation of all these effects appears to be a very challenging task . in  @xcite ,",
    "a similar idea is proposed for the creation of an extreme ultraviolet laser using metasable noble gas beams .",
    "we note that for lasing transitions with longer wavelengths ( such as infrared transitions in some molecules ) it may be possible to combine the ramsey - type lasing scheme  @xcite with mechanical blocking of the particles that would pass through the interaction regions with different phases of the field , similarly to  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate an intermediate , alternative approach to the schemes presented above , consisting in dynamically moving trapped atomic ensembles into ( and out of ) the cavity .",
    "these ensembles will be prepared in the upper lasing state outside the cavity , circumventing perturbations due to ac stark shifts .",
    "transport will be realized by means of a moving red - detuned one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice , transport of more than @xmath23 ultracold atoms over a distance of up to 20 cm with fast transport velocities of up to @xmath24 and strong accelerations of up to @xmath25 have already been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite . to confine the atoms to the lamb - dicke regime inside the cavity ,",
    "an auxilary blue - detuned stationary optical lattice is used in our scheme . both , the red - detuned and blue - detuned optical lattice should have `` magic frequencies ''  @xcite providing equal light shift for both states of the lasing transitions .",
    "the operational sequence for two ensembles consists of four stages . in the first stage",
    ", one atomic ensemble is positioned inside the cavity and starts to emit light into the cavity mode , whereas a second ensemble is trapped outside the cavity , pumped into the upper lasing state , and transported towards the cavity ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] . in the second stage ,",
    "when a significant part ( but not all ) of the atoms in the first ensemble are transferred to the ground state , the second ensemble is introduced into the cavity .",
    "the atoms of the second ensemble start to emit photons into the cavity mode mainly via stimulation emission , maintaining the optical phase . in the third stage",
    "the first ensemble is extracted from the cavity and a new inverted ensemble is prepared ( either by loading new atoms or by repumping ) while the second ensemble emits the light .",
    "the fourth stage is identical to the second one up to permutation of the ensembles . to avoid the time - dependent second - order doppler effect",
    ", one should keep a constant velocity of the moving optical lattice while atoms cross the cavity waist .",
    "this process can be repeated as many times as necessary to keep the phase of the laser field .    in the following , we model the lasing process using the heisenberg - langevin approach and",
    "study the phase stability of the emitted light .",
    "we employ a model based on the set of quantum langevin equations following  @xcite .",
    "one or two ensembles @xmath26 and @xmath27 of homogeneously broadened two - level atoms with transition frequency @xmath28 are held in a cavity characterized by a cavity damping constant @xmath29 .",
    "the finesse of the cavity is assumed to be sufficiently high to justify the mean - field approximation .",
    "the atoms interact with the radiation field of a single excited mode of the cavity which we consider as a plane wave with frequency @xmath6 . by adding up the individual atomic operators",
    ", we define the macroscopic atomic operators @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the index of the corresponding atomic ensemble , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the upper and lower lasing states , respectively .",
    "the equation for the photon annihilation operator @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 describes the time dependence of the coupling of the @xmath40th atomic ensemble with the cavity mode , @xmath41 is the langevin force . here",
    "we suppose for the sake of simplicity that all the atoms have the same coupling coefficient @xmath8 and that @xmath42 .",
    "the last approximation is valid if @xmath43 .    in our model",
    "we suppose that when a certain atomic ensemble starts to interact with the cavity field , all the atoms of this ensemble have been pumped into the state @xmath35 . during the interaction time , the set of equations for the macroscopic atomic operators ( [ eq:3 ] ) of the @xmath40th ensemble is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spontaneous decay rate of the upper lasing state , @xmath1 is the decay rate of atomic coherence , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the langevin forces . here",
    "we neglect loss of atoms from the trap during the interaction time .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath49 in this case .",
    "the mean values of the langevin forces are  @xcite @xmath50 correlation functions of the langevin forces corresponding to the intracavity field are @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of thermal photons in the cavity mode .",
    "we suppose that the temperature is low enough to set @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the correlations between the langevin forces for a specific atomic ensemble are @xmath54 langevin forces corresponding to different atomic ensembles are uncorrelated .      as a next step",
    "we introduce the stochastic @xmath55-number langevin equations which are equivalent to the operator langevin equations ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) . to establish a unique relation between operators and @xmath55-number variables we have to define the correspondence between products of @xmath55 numbers and products of operators . in  @xcite and in a number of subsequent papers  @xcite ,",
    "the normal ordering @xmath56 is chosen and the @xmath55-number langevin equations were derived in such a way that the equations for first and second moments of @xmath55-number variables @xmath57 are identical to corresponding equations for normally ordered operator variables @xmath58 .",
    "this choice leads to a redefinition of correlation functions for @xmath55-number langevin forces @xmath59 . in our case",
    "this choice of normal ordering leads to self - contradicting correlation functions , see appendix a for details .",
    "moreover , the choice of normal ordering for atomic operators @xmath60 is ambiguous , in contrast to the choice of normal ordering of field operators @xmath37 and @xmath61 .    to overcome these difficulties we use here the following rules : ( 1 ) the equations for first moments of operators and @xmath55-number values should be identical ; ( 2 ) the equations for second moments of @xmath55-number field variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 should be identical to the corresponding mean values of normally ordered field operators @xmath37 and @xmath61 ; ( 3 ) the equations for second moments of @xmath55-number atomic variables @xmath64 should be identical to corresponding equations for mean values of _ symmetrized _ products of operator variables @xmath65 .",

    "we now simulate the lasing process and study the dependence of intracavity field phase fluctuations on the temporal parameters of the lasing cycle , summarized in the ratio @xmath113 which describes the temporal overlap of different atomic ensembles inside the cavity .",

    "an ideal system would be a continuous delivery of inverted atoms trapped in the optical conveyor belt , however such a device remains to be realized experimentally . if the experimental setup traps the atoms in a pulsed regime and if it contains only two moving optical lattices , then the atomic ensemble should be loaded into the optical lattice , prepared in the upper lasing state , and transferred into the cavity during the time @xmath111 .",
    "therefore @xmath111 ( and @xmath114 ) can not be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this difficulty could in principle be overcome by scaling to more than two moving optical lattices in one setup , however , significantly enhancing the experimental complexity .",

    "an important feature of any realistic preparation and trapping of the atomic ensembles is that the number of trapped atoms fluctuates .",
    "we suppose that the dispersion of the number of atoms in one ensemble is 10% .    for all lasing stages",

    "we then trace the intracavity field variable @xmath62 over 1500 lasing cycles .",
    "this process is repeated several times which allows us to study the allan dispersion @xmath122 of the phase @xmath123 of the laser field : @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the phases averaged over the @xmath106th and @xmath127th adjanced time intervals , each of which has a duration of @xmath128 . in our case",

    ", the laser operates in the pulsed regime and the spectrum has a more complicated shape , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] . here , @xmath134 is the linewidth of the narrow central peak corresponding to the main carrier component of the spectrum .",
    "dependencies of the phase diffusion coefficient @xmath131 on the duration @xmath135 of the lasing cycle for different values of @xmath114 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] . to discuss these results ,",
    "let us consider the time dependencies of amplitude @xmath136 and phase @xmath123 of the intracavity field @xmath62 for some particular realizations ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "we see that if the lasing cycle is too short , the atoms have not enough time to develop a significant polarization .",
    "therefore almost all the atoms leave the cavity before they can transfer their energy to the cavity mode , and the intracavity field is extremely weak ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](a ) .",
    "weakness of the intracavity field leads to a comparatively large contribution of langevin forces which in turn leads to a large phase diffusion coefficient . on the other hand , if the lasing cycle is too long , the atoms of the first ensemble transfer all their energy to the intracavity field during stage 1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ( c ) .",
    "therefore at the beginning of stage 2 , when the `` fresh '' ensemble is introduced into the cavity , the first ensemble has already lost the polarization .",
    "of course , any transfer of polarization and passing on of the phase is impossible in this case .    for the optimal duration of the lasing cycle ,",
    "atoms have enough time to develop significant polarization , and this polarization survives until the introduction of the next atomic ensemble into the cavity , see fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ( b ) . in this case , during the first few lasing cycles , the amplitude of the pulses grows from pulse to pulse [ see inset in the upper graph in fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ( b ) ] , and the phase fluctuates considerably [ see the lower graph in fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "after several cycles , a quasi stationary regime with phase - linking between successive ensembles is established , and only weak phase diffusion remains [ see inset in the lower graph in fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ( b ) ] . note that for non optimal regimes presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](a ) and  [ fig : f4](c ) , the phase fluctuations in the first few pulses are practically the same as in the quasi stationary regime ; the phase can not be kept longer than a few cycles .",
    "we obtain optimal values for the lasing cycle of about @xmath137@xmath138 s length for the experimental parameters introduced above .",
    "this result can be understood intuitively by comparing it to the characteristic duration @xmath139 of a single superradiance pulse of an atomic ensemble coupled to the cavity , see appendix b. for a single ensemble ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) we estimate @xmath142 s. in the dynamic implementation discussed here , this time should be increased following the time dependence of @xmath143 .",
    "because one lasing cycle consists of two superradiation pulses , one understands that the optimal timing of these pulses corresponds to about 23@xmath139 .",
    "also we note that the optimal lasing cycle duration decreases with smaller @xmath114 because the simultaneous coupling of two atomic ensembles with the cavity mode results in a shorter radiation pulse .",
    "finally , let us consider the one - sided power spectral density @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "the power spectral density for @xmath146 ( which corresponds to a total duration of one lasing cycle of 0.5s ) , @xmath147 , averaged over 60 realizations , each with 1500 cycles , is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] .",
    "one can observe a high central peak corresponding to the main lasing component with the frequency @xmath148 , and a number of sufficiently lower sideband peaks at frequencies corresponding to multiples of the repetition frequency of the transport cycles ( 2 hz in our case ) .",
    "we proposed to keep the phase coherence between pulses of a bad - cavity active optical frequency standard by sequential coupling and decoupling of prepumped atomic ensembles with the optical cavity mode .",
    "we studied the phase diffusion of the intracavity field and demonstrated that for the optimal duration of the lasing cycle ( about a few durations of the superradiation pulse of a single atomic ensemble ) , a phase diffusion coefficient @xmath131 as low as a few @xmath149 can be realized .",
    "we found that this phase relay process is robust to 10% fluctuations of the atom number introduced into the cavity .",
    "we conclude that the method of sequential coupling may be a promising approach towards the creation of an active optical frequency standard .",

    "of course such simplification obstructs the correct behavior _ when _ the superradiance pulse starts . however , this model can reproduce the shape of the pulse because the interaction of the atomic ensemble with the thermal bath will play a significant role only in the very beginning , or in the very end of the pulse .",

    "<S> here we study how phase coherence between pulses can be maintained by using several inverted atomic ensembles , introduced into the cavity sequentially by means of a transport mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the light emission process using the heisenberg - langevin approach and study the frequency noise of the intracavity field .    </S>",
