    "the measurement of the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation paramaters has provided compelling evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles .",
    "massive active neutrinos can be naturally accounted for in see - saw type extensions of the sm , where new fermion and/or scalar representations are introduced in the theory with suitable yukawa couplings to the sm lepton doublets @xcite .",
    "the mass of the new physical states is in general unrelated to the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking scale and , therefore , can assume arbitrary large values up to the planck scale . on the purely phenomenological side ,",
    "it is interesting to study see - saw scenarios in which new physics is manifest at the tev scale and can be probed in collider searches , lhc included . in this physical context , the phenomenology of type i see - saw extensions has been studied in detail in @xcite , in a model independent way .",
    "the new particle states in such scenarios consist of at least two heavy sm - singlet fermions , which are conventionally denoted as right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , and give rise , when ew symmetry is broken , to the following mass terms in the lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the @xmath6 majorana mass matrix of the rh neutrinos and @xmath7 provides the @xmath8 neutrino dirac mass term .",
    "the majorana mass @xmath9 for the active left - handed neutrinos is given by the well known see - saw relation : @xmath10 .",
    "after the diagonalization of the full mass matrix given in ( [ typei ] ) , the charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) weak interactions involving the heavy majorana mass eigenstates @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath14 at leading order in the see - saw expansion and @xmath15 . the couplings @xmath16 can in principle be sizable , typically @xmath17 for @xmath18 gev .",
    "then , in order to reproduce small neutrino masses via the see - saw mechanism , a `` large '' contribution to @xmath9 from @xmath19 is _ exactly _ cancelled by a negative contribution from a second rh neutrino , say @xmath20 , provided : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the rh neutrino @xmath23 . barring accidental cancellations ,",
    "relation ( [ rel0 ] ) is naturally fulfilled in models where an approximately conserved lepton charged exists . in such scenarios _ @xmath19 and @xmath20 form a pseudo - dirac pair and the neutrino oscillation parameters fix the flavour structure of their weak cc and nc couplings to gauge bosons and charged leptons , up to an overall constant @xmath24 _ ( see @xcite for a details ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the light active neutrino masses in the case of a normal / inverted hierarchical ( nh / ih ) mass spectrum .",
    "the mass splitting of the two rh neutrinos is highly constrained from the experimental upper limits set in neutrinoless double beta ( - ) decay experiments .",
    "indeed , in this case the effective majorana mass @xmath29 , which controls the -decay rate , receives an additional contribution from the exchange of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath30 , which may be sizable / dominant for `` large '' couplings @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "given a nucleus @xmath33 , one has ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath34 where for @xmath35 gev : @xmath36 , @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ rel0 ] ) , the @xmath30 contribution to the effective majorana mass is simply @xmath39 with @xmath40 . in the case of _ sizable _ couplings of rh neutrinos to the charged leptons , @xmath41 @xmath42 , this contribution can be even as large as @xmath43 ev for @xmath44 and @xmath45 gev @xcite .   and",
    "@xmath20 form a pseudo - dirac pair .",
    "notice that this conclusion is valid even in the case in which there is no conserved lepton charge in the limit of zero splitting at tree level between the masses of the pair @xcite . ]  an effective majorana mass of this order of magnitude may take place in both types of neutrino mass spectrum and can be accessible in ongoing experiments looking for -decay ( @xmath41 the gerda experiment @xcite , which can probe values of @xmath29 up to @xmath46 ev ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the scenario under discussion , lepton flavour radiative decays allow to put further constraints on the size of the mixing between light and heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the strongest bounds are obtained from the current upper limit on @xmath47 branching ratio @xcite : @xmath48_{\\mu j}^ { * } \\,\\left[\\left(1+\\eta\\right)u \\right]_{e j } g\\left(\\frac{m_{j}^{2}}{m_{w}^{2}}\\right ) + \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{2 } \\left ( rv\\right)_{\\mu k}^ { * } \\left ( rv\\right)_{e k } g\\left(\\frac{m_{k}^{2}}{m_{w}^{2}}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\cong\\;2\\left [ ( rv)_{\\mu 1}^{*}\\ , ( rv)_{e1}\\right ] \\left [ g(m_1 ^ 2/m_w^2 ) - g(0)\\right]\\ , , \\label{t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "the last relation arises from ( [ rel0 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath50 , because of @xmath29 upper limit .",
    "therefore , taking @xmath51 at 90% c.l . from meg experiment @xcite , the following constraint for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 tev )",
    "is derived @xcite @xmath54 this can be recast as an upper bound on the neutrino yukawa parameter @xmath24 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) @xcite : @xmath55",
    "vs @xmath29 for @xmath56 gev and @xmath57.[fig1],width=434,height=283 ]    since the flavour structure of the neutrino yukawa couplings is fixed in the present scenarios , correlations among different low energy leptonic observables may be a relevant signature of tev scale type i see - saw mechanism .",
    "indeed , in the simple extension of the standard model considered , with the addition of two heavy rh neutrinos @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the tev scale , which behave as a pseudo - dirac particle , _ a sizable ( dominant ) contribution of @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the @xmath58-decay rate would imply a `` large '' enhancement of the muon radiative decay rate_. in fact , if @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is given in eq .",
    "( [ mee3 ] ) , it is easy to show that @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for the nh ( ih ) light neutrino mass spectrum . the analytic relation in eq .",
    "( [ bmeg ] ) is confirmed by the results of the numerical computation reported in figure  [ fig1 ] , where it is shown the correlation between the @xmath47 branching ratio and the effective majorana mass in the case of sizable couplings between the rh ( pseudo - dirac pair ) neutrinos and charged leptons . in general , a lower bound on @xmath64 within the meg experiment sensitivity reach is set for both light neutrino mass hierarchies ( normal and inverted ) if a positive signal is detected by gerda , @xmath65 for @xmath66 ev .    in conclusion , the observation of @xmath58-decay in the next generation of experiments , under preparation at present , and of the @xmath67 decay in the meg experiment ,",
    "could be the first indirect evidence for the tev scale type i see - saw mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
