    "recent advances in the trapping and cooling down to degeneracy of ultracold fermi gases have revived interest in the ground state phases of these systems.@xcite in a two - component fermi system with equal densities attractive interactions between different species lead to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing in the weak coupling limit and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the strong coupling limit.@xcite when the densities are imbalanced more exotic phases are expected to follow , such as the sarma phase@xcite with zero center - of - mass momentum and fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase@xcite with finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "there is a growing literature on the possible phases of two - component fermi gases with population and mass imbalance .",
    "@xcite the experimental efforts in ultracold fermi gases are in their beginning stage and so far only phase separation between a superfluid and a normal phase has been observed.@xcite    semiconducting electron - hole bilayer systems offer another realization of a two - component fermi system with which the exotic phases can be studied .",
    "formation of excitons between spatially separated electrons and holes and their subsequent condensation have long been predicted@xcite and arguably observed nearly 30 years later experimentally.@xcite the phase diagram of symmetric electron - hole bilayer systems ( equal mass and layer density ) is most reliably calculated by quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite recent success in fabricating closely spaced semiconducting electron - hole bilayer structures@xcite and the ability to control the densities of individual layers make the investigation of sarma and fflo phases very timely .",
    "in fact , experiments supporting evidence of a transition from the fermi liquid phase to an excitonic condensate have been recently reported through coulomb drag measurements@xcite in such structures .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in an electron - hole bilayer system with unequal electron and hole densities was recently studied in ref .   within a bcs mean field approach .",
    "sarma and fflo phases were found to be stable in some range of densities ; electron - hole bilayers appear thus promising candidates for the detection of such elusive phases .    in this paper",
    "we extend the work of ref .   by including the in - plane coulomb interactions , that were neglected there , as well as some screening effects .",
    "we find that the effect of intra - layer fock energy quantitatively changes the phase diagram moving the normal - condensed phase boundary to lower densities .",
    "comparing energy of the condensed phase with that of the normal phase , we map out the phase diagram in the average density - population polarization plane .",
    "we check the `` local '' stability of the sarma phase with respect to competing fflo order by calculating the superfluid mass density and identify a negative superfluid mass density with an instability towards an fflo phase .",
    "we calculate also the compressibility matrix in order to investigate possible instabilities towards phase separation .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of gate layer screening , which proves especially important in the discussion of the local stability of the sarma phase . at zero temperature , the simultaneous presence of the singularity in the coulomb potential and of a sharp fermi surface produces in fact a logarithmic divergence in the momentum dependence of the bcs gap function which makes the sarma phase always locally stable against the fflo phase .",
    "the inclusion of some form of screening removes this peculiar behavior , thus recovering the instability towards the fflo phase in some region of the phase diagram .",
    "the intra - layer interactions and screening effects give therefore rise to a rich phase diagram in the crossover region between the bcs - like high density state and the bec of low density excitons , showing the possibility to observe exotic superfluid phases as the population polarization is changed .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we outline the mean - field theory for electron - hole bilayers and provide the set of self - consistent equations for the quasiparticle energies and gap function . in section iii , after a brief remark about our computational procedure , we present our results for the quasiparticle properties and phase diagram of the system .",
    "we conclude in section iv with a summary and outlook .",
    "the hamiltonian describing electrons and holes in a bilayer system interacting with the coulomb potential can be written as    @xmath1    the basis states for electrons and holes are chosen to be plane wave states labeled by two - dimensional wave vectors @xmath2 as is conventional for a uniform system .",
    "the operators @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are creation / annihilation operators for electrons ( holes ) respectively .",
    "the single particle energies are denoted by @xmath5 and the matrix element @xmath6 with respect to plane wave states becomes the fourier transform of the corresponding two - body coulomb interaction @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denote the electron - electron , hole - hole and electron - hole coulomb interactions , respectively , @xmath11 is the area of a layer and @xmath12 is the inter - layer separation .",
    "we disregard the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the bilayer system is characterized by the electron and hole densities , or equivalently by the average density parameter @xmath13 ( average distance between particles in the plane in units of bohr radius @xmath14 ) , the population polarization @xmath15 ( characterizing population imbalance in terms of the ratio of density difference and total density ) defined by @xmath16 and the inter - layer separation @xmath12 .    the solution of the mean - field hamiltonian at zero temperature ( @xmath17 ) is given by the following coupled integral equations @xmath18\\label{csik } \\\\",

    "@xmath31 is just the average of the free electron and hole dispersions ( with respect to the corresponding chemical potentials ) .",

    "these effects are described by a screening function which usually decreases the strength of the bare coulomb interaction for electrons and holes in the normal phase . however , the 2d screening due to intra- and inter - layer interactions is difficult to take into account properly for the condensed phase.@xcite in order to see the qualitative effects of screening we consider the mechanism of gate screening which can be taken into account in a simple way . in this mechanism",
    "the coulomb potential of a point charge is replaced by that of a dipole consisting of the point charge and its image behind the metallic gate .",
    "we have approximately modelled the screening by the gate potential by taking the intra- and inter - layer interactions to be @xmath34 respectively , where the parameter @xmath35 is a screening wave number . in recent experiments with metallic gates to control the charge densities , the separation between the gate and 2d layer is about @xmath36 nm @xcite .",
    "thus , the image charge is @xmath37 nm away from the real charge and we may assume that for distances larger than 500 nm , the coulomb potential will be screened . in our calculations",
    "we take the screening length associated with gate screening to be @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "we have also checked other values of @xmath35 and found that the results are largely insensitive in the range @xmath40 .",
    "we solve the gap equations by representing the unknown functions on a grid of @xmath41-points ( after angular integration ) and using a non - linear root finding scheme for the function values on grid points . for balanced populations",
    "an iterative scheme provides a robust method of solution . for imbalanced populations we employ a root finding scheme for the function values on grid points and chemical potential values .",
    "we start with the equal density solution at the same average density and create imbalance first at a small finite temperature and then decrease the temperature ( using the solution from the previous step as input ) until results do not change with temperature any more .",
    "the integrals are evaluated using gaussian quadrature .",
    "the finite temperature is necessary to obtain smooth functions and gradients for the newton - raphson root finding algorithm .",
    "we found it necessary to introduce up to three different grids for integration to handle `` discontinuities '' at low temperatures , when one type of occupation number becomes equal to unity @xmath42 ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) in a region of @xmath41-space ( and causing the integrands to vanish there ) .",
    "the so - called sarma states obtained in this way are of the following bcs form @xmath45 where the resulting wave function has a certain range of @xmath2 states ( the set denoted by @xmath46 ) occupied with quasi - particles of the bcs theory giving rise to population imbalance .",
    "the region @xmath46 is where the quasi - particle energy @xmath30 becomes negative , i.e. less than that of the ground pair energy and the corresponding quasi - particle occupation becomes unity .",
    "incidentally , the quasi - particles of bcs theory are just electron or hole states at that wave vector @xmath2 . outside the set",
    "@xmath46 we have pairs @xmath0 of electrons and holes.@xcite therefore , at @xmath17 there can be one or two fermi surfaces depending where the set of @xmath47 vectors are .",
    "these topologically different phases will be called sarma-1 ( s1 ) and sarma-2 ( s2 ) .",
    "these states have also been called breached pair states  @xcite displaying a fermi surface together with a condensate .",
    "the gap function is non - zero but there are gapless excitations .      in the following we present physical quantities in rydberg units ,",
    "i.e. length is measured in effective ( excitonic ) bohr radius @xmath48 , momentum in @xmath49 and energy in effective rydberg ( ryd= @xmath50 ) .",
    "the reduced mass @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the band mass of the electron and hole , respectively . in the numerical calculations we specialize to gaas system parameters with mass ratio @xmath55 and background dielectric constant @xmath56 .",
    "representative solutions with one and two fermi surfaces at @xmath17 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ( bare coulomb interaction ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : gapscr ] ( screened interactions ) for @xmath57 .",
    "the figures show the gap function @xmath29 , the quasi - particle energies @xmath30 and their average @xmath58 on the left panels , and the electron and hole occupation numbers @xmath59 on the right panels . at @xmath17 in the ground state ,",
    "the quasi - particle levels with negative energy are occupied , positive energy levels are empty .",
    "the two different type of excitation branches are split both due to different electron - hole mass and chemical potential values .",
    "when one of the spectra crosses the zero energy axis , population imbalance is created .",
    "if the negative energy region includes the origin at @xmath60 , the ground state has one fermi surface , otherwise it has two .",
    "the two cases are denoted by s1 and s2 respectively .",
    "the top panel in each figure shows an s2 phase and the bottom panel shows an s1 phase .",
    "since the quasi - particle energy branch is continuous the system still has gapless excitations . a close investigation of the gap function @xmath29 in the absence of screening ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ) shows that it has a cusp at the zero crossings of the quasi - particle energy , corresponding to a divergence in the derivative of @xmath29 .",
    "this divergence has important consequences on the stability of the sarma phase at @xmath17 , as discussed below .",
    "the `` local '' stability of the sarma phase with respect to phases of the fflo type is usually assessed by calculating the superfluid mass density ( phase stiffness).@xcite this quantity should be positive in a stable state and a negative value is identified with an instability towards an fflo phase.@xcite clearly , the positivity of the superfluid mass density guarantees only that the sarma phase is a local minumum of the energy with respect to fluctuations of the gap parameter associated with pairing of the fflo type , and does not exclude the possibility that an fflo phase with finite pair momentum can be a global mimimum of the energy .",
    "when this happens , the local stability of the sarma phase actually corresponds to metastability .",
    "the superfluid mass density is given by  @xcite @xmath61\\phantom{aa }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the inverse temperature .",
    "at @xmath17 this expression can be written as  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the roots of @xmath65 with @xmath66 . at zero temperature",
    "the last expression involves the derivative of @xmath67 ( through the derivative of @xmath68 ) at the zero crossings of @xmath68 .",
    "as mentioned above , our calculations are carried out at nonzero but small temperature .",
    "we have found that this derivative diverges logarithmically as @xmath69 . in particular , we have demonstrateed analytically that for the bare coulomb interaction one has @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the zero crossing point at @xmath17 as @xmath72 @xmath73 which we have also checked numerically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deldiv ] ) .",
    "this divergence is due to the simultaneous presence of the long range coulomb interaction , which is singular at @xmath74 , and the discontinuity of the fermi function at @xmath17 .",
    "finite temperature and/or screening effects , smear out these singularities thus removing the divergence .",
    "the presence of this divergence at @xmath17 was overlooked in the previous mean field study of the imbalanced electron - hole bilayer system  @xcite . as a matter of fact , making this divergence emerge from the numerical calculation requires the achievement of very low temperatures in the calculations and an extreme precision in the numerical integration .",
    "the presence of this divergence is particularly meaningful for the analysis of the local stability of the sarma phase at strictly @xmath17 .",
    "the diverging derivative makes in fact the negative contribution to @xmath75 vanish , thus implying that for the unscreened coulomb interaction the sarma phase is always locally stable at @xmath17 .",
    "this result is interesting as a matter of principle , as it offers an `` extreme '' example , where the argument by forbes _",
    "et al_. @xcite that mass ratio and momentum structure of the interactions should favor the stability of sarma phase is completely effective . on the other hand",
    "we expect it to have few practical consequences , since the stability of the sarma phase induced by this divergence is very fragile with respect to finite temperature and/or screening effects . as fig .",
    "[ fig : deldiv ] clearly shows , quite small temperatures suffice to smear out the divergence in the derivative .",
    "alternatively , the simple screened interaction makes the divergence to disapper even at @xmath17 , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deldiv ] . as a result ,",
    "in the presence of screening , the sarma phase will indeed be locally unstable in certain regions of the @xmath76 plane , as discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the mechanical stability of the system with respect to phase separation requires the compressibility matrix @xmath77 to be positive definite .",
    "we have therefore calculated the compressibility matrix across our phase diagram to check also this stability .",
    "when the intra - layer coulomb interaction is neglected , the compressibility matrix develops negative eigenvalues across most of our phase diagram ( restricting the stable region only to small values of @xmath13 ) in agreement with the findings of the recent work by yamashita _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "however , as it was already argued in ref .",
    ", this apparent dominant instability towards phase separation is an artifact occurring when the intra - layer coulomb repulsion is artificially excluded from the calculation .",
    "it should therefore not be taken seriously .",
    "in particular , we have verified explicitly that in our calculations _ with _",
    "coulomb intra - layer repulsion , the hartree term , which increases linearly with the distance @xmath78 between the metallic gates and the electron / hole layers , washes out completely phase separation from our phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phased1 ] already for distances @xmath78 of the order of 5 - 10 @xmath14 , well below the typical gate - to - layer distances in current devices .",
    "we thus conclude that , contrary to what happens in cold atom systems , phase separation is not an issue in electron - hole bilayer systems .",
    "in this section we present the phase diagram resulting from the comparison of the energies of the sarma and normal phases and from the stability analysis discussed in the previous section .",
    "we set the inter - layer separation equal to one effective ( excitonic ) bohr radius @xmath57 . to make contact with previous literature , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : phased1 ] the phase diagram for progressively refined approximations corresponding to the inclusion in the calculations of : ( i ) bare inter - layer interactions only , ( ii ) bare inter- and intra - layer interactions , ( iii ) screened inter - layer interactions only and ( iv ) screened inter- and intra - layer interactions .    for bare interactions ,",
    "the superfluid density is always positive and the sarma phase is `` locally '' stable , due to the mechanism explained in sec .",
    "[ stability ] .",
    "therefore , in the top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : phased1 ] we do not show any fflo phase , but our calculations do not rule out the possibility of a first order transition to an fflo phase with a finite fflo modulation momentum @xmath79 as found in ref .  .",
    "two topologically distinct sarma phases , sarma-1 with one fermi surface and sarma-2 with two fermi surfaces , are present in the phase diagrams .",
    "the effect of the intra - layer repulsive interactions is to favor the normal phase with respect to the condensed phases , thus shifting to higher vaues of @xmath13 the boundary between normal and condensed phases ( right panels ) .",
    "the two bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : phased1 ] presents the phase diagram when the gate screening is taken into account . with inter - layer interactions only",
    ", the sarma phase becomes unstable for a large portion of the phase diagram , especially with excess holes , i.e. @xmath80 .",
    "( bottom left panel ) there is no stable s2 phase in this case .",
    "switching on the intra - layer interactions reduces the space occupied by the fflo phase in our phase diagram and restores the s2 phase in some region of the phase diagram .",
    "this result is physically quite sensible , as the fflo modulations of the gap parameter should be unavoidably accompanied by some modulations of the density in real space . in the presence of the coulomb intra - layer repulsion",
    "such density modulations are energetically expensive , thus hindering the fflo phase with respect to the sarma phase.@xcite    a quite rich phase diagram is therefore obtained when both intra - layer and screening effects are present .",
    "the presence of locally stable sarma phases confirms the expectation that isotropic translationally invariant gapless superfluid states can be stable with momentum dependent interaction.@xcite we note in this context that in recent work , sarma phases were found to be stable also in two - dimensional , two - band neutral fermi systems.@xcite",
    "we have studied a bilayer system of electron and hole layers spatially separated by an insulating barrier , where the electron and hole densities can be controlled independently and have analyzed @xmath81-wave pairing between electrons and holes as a function of average density and population difference using mean - field theory . by solving the relevant energy gap equations we have compared the energy of the condensed phase called the sarma phase with that of the normal state which is the sum of the electron and hole fermi liquid energy described by the hartree - fock solution .",
    "we have included both inter- and intra - layer interactions generalizing earlier work which did not include in - plane interactions .",
    "@xcite in this way the phase boundary for the ground state is established in the density - population polarization ( @xmath76 ) plane .",
    "the `` local '' stability of the sarma phase was checked by calculating the superfluid mass density , whereas the stability with respect to phase separation was assessed by calculating the compressibility matrix .",
    "we have found that with bare coulomb interactions the sarma phase is always locally stable due to a peculiar momentum structure of the gap function originating from the singular infrared behavior of the coulomb potential , and the simultaneous presence of a sharp fermi surface at zero temperature .    employing a simple model of screening which introduces an infrared cut - off in the coulomb interaction",
    ", we have found that some regions in the phase space become unstable .",
    "we interpret this as an instability towards an fflo phase .",
    "together with intra - layer interactions , the phase diagram in the crossover regime from the weakly interacting high density bcs limit to the strongly interacting bec of dilute excitons has room for various phases .",
    "the topologically different s1 and s2 sarma phases and fflo are present with the inclusion of screening and intra - layer interactions . on the other hand , without any screening there is no instability towards fflo and turning off intra - layer interactions the phase diagram does not show an s2 state .",
    "currently , the experimental situation allows these systems to be realized .",
    "@xcite quantitative comparison would require a more realistic model of screening , accounting for the condensed phase and finite width of the quantum wells , incorporating the disorder effects , and inclusion of spin degrees of freedom which may enter non - trivially when there are spin dependent interactions such as spin - orbit coupling . with the renewed mean - field phase diagram at hand",
    ", it would also be interesting to perform qmc simulations to probe the predicted phases .",

    "<S> we study excitonic condensation in an electron - hole bilayer system with unequal layer densities at zero temperature . using mean - field theory </S>",
    "<S> we solve the bcs gap equations numerically and investigate the effects of intra - layer interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the stability of the sarma phase with @xmath0 pairing by calculating the superfluid mass density and also by checking the compressibility matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with bare coulomb interactions the superfluid density is always positive in the sarma phase , due to a peculiar momentum structure of the gap function originating from the singular behavior of the coulomb potential at zero momentum and the presence of a sharp fermi surface . introducing a simple model for screening , we find that the superfluid density becomes negative in some regions of the phase diagram , corresponding to an instability towards a fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) type superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , intra - layer interaction and screening together can lead to a rich phase diagram in the bcs - bec crossover regime in electron - hole bilayer systems . </S>"
