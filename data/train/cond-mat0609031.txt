    "transport in many random structures is `` anomalous , ''",
    "i.e. , fundamentally different from that in regular space @xcite .",
    "the anomaly is due to the random substrate on which transport is constrained to take place .",
    "random structures are found in many places in the real world , from oil reservoirs to the internet , making the study of anomalous transport properties a far - reaching field . in this problem , it is paramount to relate the structural properties of the medium with the transport properties .",
    "an important and recent example of random substrates is that of complex networks .",
    "research on this topic has uncovered their importance for real - world problems as diverse as the world wide web and the internet to cellular networks and sexual - partner networks @xcite .",
    "networks describe also economic systems such as financial markets and banks systems @xcite .",
    "transport of goods and information in such networks is of much interest .",
    "two distinct models describe the two limiting cases for the structure of the complex networks .",
    "the first of these is the classic erds - rnyi model of random networks @xcite , for which sites are connected with a link with probability @xmath5 and are disconnected ( no link ) with probability @xmath6 ( see fig . [ er_diag](a ) ) . in this case",
    "the degree distribution @xmath7 , the probability of a node to have @xmath8 connections , is a poisson @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average degree of the network .",
    "mathematicians discovered critical phenomena through this model .",
    "for instance , just as in percolation on lattices , there is a critical value @xmath11 above which the largest connected component of the network has a mass that scales with the system size @xmath12 , but below @xmath13 , there are only small clusters of the order of @xmath14 . at @xmath11 ,",
    "the size of the largest cluster is of order of @xmath15.another characteristic of an erds - rnyi network is its `` small - world '' property which means that the average distance @xmath16 ( or diameter ) between all pairs of nodes of the network scales as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the other model , recently identified as the characterizing topological structure of many real world systems , is the barabsi - albert scale - free network and its extensions @xcite , characterized by a scale - free degree distribution : @xmath17 , \\label{degree}\\ ] ] the cutoff value @xmath18 represents the minimum allowed value of @xmath8 on the network ( @xmath19 here ) , and @xmath20 , the typical maximum degree of a network with @xmath12 nodes @xcite .",
    "the scale - free feature allows a network to have some nodes with a large number of links ( `` hubs '' ) , unlike the case for the erds - rnyi model of random networks @xcite ( see fig .  [ er_diag](b ) ) .",
    "scale - free networks with @xmath21 have @xmath22 , while for @xmath23 they are `` ultra - small - world '' since the diameter scales as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "here we extend our recent study of transport in complex networks @xcite .",
    "we find that for scale - free networks with @xmath25 , transport properties characterized by conductance display a power - law tail distribution that is related to the degree distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the origin of this power - law tail is due to pairs of nodes of high degree which have high conductance .",
    "thus , transport in scale - free networks is better because of the presence of large degree nodes ( hubs ) that carry much of the traffic , whereas erds - rnyi networks lack hubs and the transport properties are controlled mainly by the average degree @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we present a simple physical picture of the transport properties and test it through simulations .",
    "we also study a form of frictionless transport , in which transport is measured by the number of independent paths between source and destination .",
    "these later results are in part similar to those in @xcite .",
    "we test our findings on a real network , a recent map of the internet .",
    "in addition , we study the properties of the transport where several sources and sinks are involved .",
    "we find a principal difference between the two forms of transport mentioned above , and find an optimal number of sources in the frictionless case .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ transport ] concentrates on the numerical calculation of the electrical conductance of networks . in sec .",
    "[ theory_section ] a simple physical picture gives a theoretical explanation of the results .",
    "section [ frictionless ] deals with the number of link - independent paths as a form of frictionless transport . in section [ multiple ]",
    "we extend the study of frictionless transport to the case of multiple sources . finally , in sec .",
    "[ summary ] we present the conclusions and summarize the results in a coherent picture .",
    "most of the work done so far regarding complex networks has concentrated on static topological properties or on models for their growth @xcite .",
    "transport features have not been extensively studied with the exception of random walks on specific complex networks @xcite .",
    "transport properties are important because they contain information about network function @xcite . here",
    "we study the electrical conductance @xmath0 between two nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 of erds - rnyi and scale - free networks when a potential difference is imposed between them .",
    "we assume that all the links have equal resistances of unit value @xcite .",
    "we construct the erds - rnyi and scale - free model networks in a standard manner @xcite .",
    "we calculate the conductance @xmath0 of the network between two nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 using the kirchhoff method @xcite , where entering and exiting potentials are fixed to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "first , we analyze the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath31 which comes from @xmath32 , the probability that two nodes on the network have conductance between @xmath0 and @xmath33 . to this end",
    ", we introduce the cumulative distribution @xmath34 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fg_lamb2.5 - 3.3-er_n8000 ] for the erds - rnyi and scale - free ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath19 ) cases .",
    "we use the notation @xmath4 and @xmath37 for scale - free , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 for erds - rnyi .",
    "the function @xmath37 for both @xmath35 and 3.3 exhibits a tail region well fit by the power law @xmath40 and the exponent @xmath41 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath39 decreases exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "we next study the origin of the large values of @xmath0 in scale - free networks and obtain an analytical relation between @xmath3 and @xmath42 .",
    "larger values of @xmath0 require the presence of many parallel paths , which we hypothesize arise from the high degree nodes .",
    "thus , we expect that if either of the degrees @xmath43 or @xmath44 of the entering and exiting nodes is small ( e.g. @xmath45 ) , the conductance @xmath0 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is small since there are at most @xmath8 different parallel branches coming out of a node with degree @xmath8 .",
    "thus , a small value of @xmath8 implies a small number of possible parallel branches , and therefore a small value of @xmath0 . to observe large @xmath0 values",
    ", it is therefore necessary that both @xmath43 and @xmath44 be large .",
    "we test this hypothesis by large scale computer simulations of the conditional pdf @xmath46 for specific values of the entering and exiting node degrees @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "consider first @xmath47 , and the effect of increasing @xmath44 , with @xmath43 fixed .",
    "we find that @xmath46 is narrowly peaked ( fig .",
    "[ pgka750_kb4 - 128_n8000_ab7_lamb2.5](a ) ) so that it is well characterized by @xmath48 , the value of @xmath0 when @xmath49 is a maximum .",
    "we find similar results for erds - rnyi networks .",
    "further , for increasing @xmath44 , we find [ fig .",
    "[ pgka750_kb4 - 128_n8000_ab7_lamb2.5](b ) ] @xmath48 increases as @xmath50 , with @xmath51 consistent with the possibility that as @xmath52 , @xmath53 which we assume henceforth .",
    "for the case of @xmath54 , @xmath48 increases less fast than @xmath44 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ g_over_kb_vs_ka_over_kb_combi_n8000_lamb2.5_ab7_m2 ] where we plot @xmath55 against the scaled degree @xmath56 .",
    "the collapse of @xmath55 for different values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicates that @xmath48 scales as @xmath57 below we study the possible origin of this function .",
    "the behavior of the scaling function @xmath58 can be interpreted using the following simplified `` transport backbone '' picture [ fig .",
    "[ g_over_kb_vs_ka_over_kb_combi_n8000_lamb2.5_ab7_m2 ] inset ] , for which the effective conductance @xmath0 between nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 satisfies @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the resistance of the `` transport backbone '' while @xmath61 ( and @xmath62 ) are the resistances of the set of links near node @xmath27 ( and node @xmath28 ) not belonging to the `` transport backbone '' .",
    "it is plausible that @xmath63 is linear in @xmath43 , so we can write @xmath64 . since node @xmath28 is equivalent to node @xmath27 , we expect @xmath65 .",
    "hence @xmath66 so the scaling function defined in eq .  ( [ g_max_scaled ] ) is @xmath67 the second equality follows if there are many parallel paths on the `` transport backbone '' so that @xmath68 . the prediction ( [ e4b ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ g_over_kb_vs_ka_over_kb_combi_n8000_lamb2.5_ab7_m2 ] for both scale - free and erds - rnyi networks and the agreement with the simulations supports the approximate validity of the transport backbone picture of conductance in scale - free and erds - rnyi networks .    within this `` transport backbone '' picture",
    ", we can analytically calculate @xmath37 .",
    "the key insight necessary for this calculation is that @xmath69 , when @xmath70 , and we assume that @xmath71 is also valid given the narrow shape of @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that the probability of observing conductance @xmath0 is related to @xmath44 through @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the probability that , when nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are chosen at random , @xmath44 is the minimum degree .",
    "this can be calculated analytically through @xmath74 performing the integration we obtain for @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "\\label{phig}\\ ] ] hence , for @xmath37 , we have @xmath77 . to test this prediction",
    ", we perform simulations for scale - free networks and calculate the values of @xmath78 from the slope of a log - log plot of the cumulative distribution @xmath37 . from fig .",
    "[ fg_g_lamb2.5 - 3.5_8000](b ) we find that @xmath79 thus , the measured slopes are consistent with the theoretical values predicted by eq .",
    "( [ phig ] ) .",
    "in many systems , it is the nature of the transport process that the particles flowing through the network links experience no friction . for example , this is the case in an electrical system made of super - conductors @xcite , or in the case of water flow along pipes , if frictional effects are minor .",
    "other examples are flow of cars along traffic routes , and perhaps most important , the transport of information in communication networks .",
    "common to all these processes is that , the quality of the transport is determined by the number of link - independent paths leading from the source to the destination ( and the capacity of each path ) , and not by the length of each path ( as is the case for simple electrical conductance ) . in this section ,",
    "we focus on non - weighted networks , and define the conductance , as the number of link - independent paths between a given source and destination ( sink ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we name this transport process as the _ max - flow model _ , and denote the conductance as @xmath80 .",
    "fast algorithms for solving the max - flow problem , given a network and a pair @xmath81 are well known within the computer science community @xcite .",
    "we apply those methods to random scale - free and erds - rnyi networks , and observe similarities and differences from the electrical conductance transport model .",
    "max - flow analysis has been applied recently for complex networks in general @xcite , and for the internet in particular @xcite , where it was used as a significant tool in the structural analysis of the underlying network .",
    "we find , that in the max - flow model , just as in the electrical conductance case , scale - free networks exhibit a power - law decay of the distribution of conductances with the same exponent ( and thus very high conductance values are possible ) , while in erds - rnyi networks , the conductance decays exponentially ( fig .",
    "[ flow_cumulative_distribution](a ) ) . in order to better understand this behavior",
    ", we plot the scaled - flow @xmath82 as a function of the scaled - degree @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ flow_cumulative_distribution](b ) ) . it can be seen that the transition at @xmath84 is sharp . for all @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) , while for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 ) . in other words ,",
    "the conductance simply equals the minimum of the degrees of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the symbols of eq .",
    "( [ gh ] ) , this also implies that @xmath93 ; i.e. scale - free networks are optimal for transport in the max - flow sense .",
    "the derivation leading to eq .",
    "( [ phig ] ) becomes then exact , so that the distribution of conductances is given again by @xmath94 .",
    "we have so far observed that the max - flow model is quite similar to electrical conductance , both have similar finite probability of finding very high values of conductance .",
    "also , the fact that the minimum degree plays a dominant role in the number of link - independent paths makes the scaling behavior of the electrical and frictionless problems similar .",
    "only when the conductances are studied as a function of distance , some differences between the electrical and frictionless cases begin to emerge . in fig ,",
    "[ flow_distance](a ) , we plot the dependence of the average conductance @xmath95 with respect to the minimum degree @xmath96 of the source and sink , for different values of the shortest distance @xmath97 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and find that @xmath95 is independent of @xmath97 as the curves for different @xmath97 overlap . this result is a consequence of the frictionless character of the max - flow problem .",
    "however , when we consider the electrical case , this independence disappears .",
    "this is illustrated in fig ,  [ flow_distance](b ) , where @xmath98 is also plotted against the minimum degree @xmath96 , but in this case , curves with different @xmath97 no longer overlap . from the plot we find that @xmath98 decreases as the distance increases .    to test the validity of our model results in real networks",
    ", we measured the conductance @xmath99 on the most up to date map of the autonomous systems ( as ) level of the internet structure  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ flow_internet ] we find that the slope of the plot , which corresponds to @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ phig ] ) , is approximately 2.3 , implying that @xmath100 , in agreement with the value of the degree distribution exponent for the internet observed in  @xcite .",
    "thus , transport properties can yield information on the topology of the network .",
    "in many cases it is desirable to explore the more general situation , where the transport takes place between _ groups _ of nodes , not necessarily between a single source and a single sink .",
    "this might be a frequent scenario in systems such as the internet , where data should be sent between a group of computers to another group , or in transportation network , where we can consider the quality of transport between e.g. countries , where the network of direct connections ( flights , roads , etc . ) between cities is already established .",
    "the generalization of the above defined models is straightforward . for the electrical transport case ,",
    "once we choose our @xmath101 sources and @xmath101 sinks , we simply wire the @xmath101 sources together to the positive potential @xmath102 , and the @xmath101 sinks to @xmath103 . for the max flow case , we connect the @xmath101 sources to a _ super - source _ with infinite capacity links , the same for the sinks .",
    "we then consider the max flow between the super - source and the super - sink .    for simplicity of notation , in this section",
    "we denote the electrical conductance with @xmath0 and the max - flow with simply @xmath104 ( instead of @xmath105 ) .",
    "the interesting quantity to consider in this case is the average conductance , or flow , _ per source _ , i.e. @xmath106 or @xmath107 ( the averaging notation will be omitted when it is clear from the context ) , since this takes into account the obvious increase in transport due to the multiple sources .",
    "considering the transport per source gives thus a proper indication of the network utilization .    in fig .",
    "[ per_source ] we analyze the dependence of the transport on @xmath101 .",
    "consider first the case of max flow , in [ per_source](a ) .",
    "it is seen , that the flow first _",
    "increases _ with @xmath101 , and then decreases , for both network models and network sizes .",
    "this observation is consistent with the transport backbone picture described above , if we generalize the definition of the transport backbone to include now all nodes in the network that are nor sources neither sinks . for small @xmath101 ( or more precisely , @xmath108 ) ,",
    "the transport backbone remains as large , and hence as a good conductor , as it is in the case of a single source ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect again the flow to depend only on the degrees of the sources and the sinks . with one source and sink ,",
    "the flow is confined by the smaller degree of the source and the sink . with multiple sources and sinks",
    ", the flow will be the minimum of + @xmath110}~$ ] .",
    "the more sources we have ( larger @xmath101 ) , the more chances for the sum of the degrees to be larger ( since for a sum of many degrees to be smaller , we need _ all _ the degrees to be small , which is less probable ) .",
    "thus for small @xmath101 , @xmath107 increases . an exact theory for this region",
    "is developed below .",
    "as @xmath101 grows larger , not only that the transport backbone becomes smaller , but the number of paths that need to go through it grows too .",
    "therefore , many paths that were parallel before now require the simultaneous usage of the same link , and the backbone is no longer a perfect conductor .",
    "in other words , the _ interaction _ between the outgoing paths causes the decrease in the backbone transport capability .    from these two contradicting trends emerges the appearance of an _ optimal _",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath111 . which is the @xmath101 for which the flow per source is maximized .",
    "this has an important consequences for networks design , since it tells us that a network has an optimal `` number of users '' for which the utilization of the network is maximized .",
    "increasing or decreasing the number of nodes in each group , will force each node , on average , to use less of the network resources .    in fig .",
    "[ per_source](b ) , we plot the same for the electrical conductance case .",
    "but , in contrast to the flow case , here the conductance per source only _ increases _ with respect to the number of sources @xmath101 .",
    "the reason is , that for large @xmath101 , the _ number _ of parallel paths decrease , but their _ lengths _ decrease ( since for so many sources and sinks , there is more probability for a direct or almost direct connection between some source and some sink ) , and therefore the conductance of each path significantly increase , such that the total flow increases too . all this did not affect the flow , since there , as mentioned in section [ frictionless ] ,",
    "the total flow do not depend on the distance between the source and the sink .",
    "this fact , that electrical conductance improves with more sources , while flow only degrades , actually points out a fundamental difference between the two types of transport phenomena .",
    "this actually is a consequence of the arguments given in section [ frictionless ] as for the distance dependence , and completes the picture considering the comparison between the models .    for the max - flow model ,",
    "a closed form formulas for @xmath112 and the probability distribution of the flow @xmath113 ( for a given n ) can be derived analytically in the region where @xmath108 , where we can assume there is no interaction at all between the paths of the @xmath101 pairs , such that the flow is just the minimum of + @xmath114}~$ ] .",
    "a comparison between the theoretical formula and the simulation results will enable us to directly test this hypothesis ; moreover it will mark the region ( @xmath101 values ) where `` no interaction '' between flow paths exist .",
    "next , we present the analytic derivation for small n. denote by @xmath115 the sum of degrees of @xmath101 nodes . the total flow between @xmath101 sources and @xmath101 sinks",
    "is then given by @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "to calculate the distribution of flows ( from which the average flow is found easily ) one has first to calculate the distribution of the sum of @xmath101 iidrv s @xmath117 : @xmath118 $ ] , for sf graphs , or @xmath119 for er graphs . for @xmath120 , this is easy with the central limit theorem .",
    "however , for very large @xmath101 , the effect of the interactions will begin to appear .",
    "therefore , one should calculate the distribution of the sum directly , using convolution .",
    "if we consider the sf degree distributions to be discrete , the pdf of a sum of degrees of 2 nodes is then given by - @xmath121 which can be computed exactly in a computer , for a given @xmath122 .",
    "the calculation can be easily extended to @xmath101 equals other pairs of 2 . for er networks",
    ", it is known that the sum of @xmath101 poisson variables with parameter @xmath3 is also a poisson variable with parameter @xmath123 .",

    "( [ e_min ] ) , together with the simulation results , for er and sf networks .",

    "[ scaling ] ) , all curves with different values of @xmath12 collapse .",
    "thus we conclude the scaling form : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a function of a single variable only .",
    "the same scaling appears for the flow as well ( data not shown ) .",
    "in summary , we find that the conductance of scale - free networks is highly heterogeneous , and depends strongly on the degree of the two nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we also find a power - law tail for @xmath133 and relate the tail exponent @xmath42 to the exponent @xmath3 of the degree distribution @xmath7 .",
    "this power law behavior makes scale - free networks better for transport .",
    "our work is consistent with a simple physical picture of how transport takes place in scale - free and erds - rnyi networks , which presents the transport backbone as an explanation to the fact that the transport virtually depends only on the smallest degree of the two nodes .",
    "this scenario appears to be valid also for the frictionless transport model , as clearly indicated by the similarity in the results .",
    "we analyze this model and compare its properties to the electrical conductance case .",
    "we also compare our model results on a real network of the as internet and obtain good agreement .",

    "we find that this mode arises a fundamental difference between the behavior of the electrical and frictionless transport models .",
    "we also find an optimal number of sources in which the transport is most efficient , and explain its origin .    finally , we point out that our study can be further extended",
