    "one of the outstanding problems in modern astrophysics concerns the formation of globular clusters .",
    "long thought to constitute a simple , homogeneous class of object , each one consisting of stars of a uniform age and elemental composition , it is now recognised that these systems harbor multiple stellar populations displaying a wide variety of unexpected characteristics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "all galactic globular clusters for which large samples of members have been studied spectroscopically at sufficiently high resolution and signal - to - noise are found to be comprised of stars exhibiting a characteristic chemical signature  a strong anti - correlation between the abundances of the light elements o - na , as well as",
    "c - n and mg - al in many cases , even while remaining homogeneous in iron content ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since this pattern is observed in stars on the main sequence as well as in red giants , it must be primordial rather than being the result of nucleosynthesis and mixing within the observed giant stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pattern is also seen in ancient globular clusters in nearby galaxies  for example , in the large magellanic cloud @xcite and the fornax @xcite and sagittarius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dwarfs  but not observed in old open clusters ( with the recent exception of ngc 6791 , * ? ? ? * ) or for the vast majority of the milky way field halo ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , implying that it is a product specifically linked to globular cluster formation processes .    beyond the anti - correlated light element abundance variations many globular clusters exhibit various additional levels of inhomogeneity , such as split main sequences or multiple sub - giant branches on their color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , internal dispersions in the abundance of iron or other elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or subpopulations enhanced in helium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the overall picture is of a huge wealth of complexity that poses serious challenges for models of globular cluster formation and evolution .",
    "the pervasive light element anti - correlations require material processed at high temperatures via proton capture reactions . at @xmath2",
    "k the cno and nane cycles serve to alter the carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and sodium abundances , while at somewhat higher temperatures the mgal cycle also becomes active , leading to enhanced aluminium and reduced magnesium abundances . in the presently favored model ,",
    "material processed in this way in a first generation of stars pollutes or forms a central accumulation of gas in a young globular cluster , and a second generation of stars bearing the characteristic light element signature is subsequently formed from this reservoir ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that because the iron content in most clusters is observed to be homogeneous , the gas should typically not have undergone supernova enrichment .",
    "leading suggestions for the sites of the high temperature processing are intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and fast - rotating massive stars ( frms ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both cases helium enhancement",
    "may also be introduced to the gas reservoir as a result of main sequence hydrogen burning in the polluting stars .",
    "a generic prediction of this model is that the second generation of stars in a globular cluster ought to be more centrally concentrated than the first generation , and this seems to have been observed in some cases @xcite .",
    "however , the model also suffers from a number of difficulties , chief among which is that the second generation stars in globular clusters require significantly more gas for formation than can have been available based on the presently - observed numbers of first generation members .",
    "ideas invoked to circumvent this issue include the accretion of large amounts of pristine interstellar material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a first generation @xmath3 times more massive than present - day globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a first generation with a top - heavy initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a variation in which globular clusters are formed as part of initially larger systems such as low - mass dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . beyond this difficulty ,",
    "it is also unclear how clusters with internal dispersions in iron - peak elements , or that include populations with very high helium abundances ( @xmath4 ) fit into the model .",
    "the unavoidable conclusion from the scenario outlined above is that the formation of individual globular clusters must have spanned a period of tens to hundreds of myr , depending on the nature of the stars responsible for the high temperature processing . with presently available facilities ,",
    "however , we are unable to directly resolve age differences of this magnitude given that galactic globular clusters are typically @xmath5 gyr old .",
    "in addition , since the time - scale for dynamical relaxation in the majority of galactic globular clusters is much shorter than the cluster age ( see * ? ? ? * ) any detailed information imprinted on the internal kinematics of these systems as a result of the formation process will have long since been seriously diluted or possibly erased altogether .",
    "star clusters in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) offer an important new piece of this puzzle .",
    "these two galaxies possess extensive systems of clusters spanning the full age range @xmath6 years ; many of the members of these systems are comparable in mass to present - day galactic globular clusters lying at or below the peak of the luminosity function ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "using images taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we recently demonstrated that several rich intermediate - age clusters ( @xmath7 gyr ) in the lmc display markedly unusual cmds @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we found that while the cmds for ngc 1783 , 1806 and 1846 have very narrow main sequences and red giant branches , the main - sequence turn - offs for these clusters are much broader than can be explained by the photometric uncertainties ( see figure [ f : cmds ] ) . after considering various possibilities for the origin of these extended main - sequence turn - offs ( emstos ) , such as confusion due to unresolved binary stars or field contamination",
    ", we concluded that the simplest viable interpretation of our observations is that each of the three clusters is comprised of two or more stellar populations with very similar iron abundance but spanning an age interval of @xmath0 myr .",
    "subsequent work has reinforced this interpretation and revealed that an emsto is apparently not an unusual feature for intermediate - age magellanic cloud clusters .",
    "photometric analysis of hst imaging by @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that , of the @xmath8 intermediate - age lmc clusters with suitable data , @xmath9 possess emstos ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite discovered that the intermediate - age smc cluster ngc 419 possesses an emsto .",
    "each of these studies concluded that an internal age spread was the most likely explanation for these features , with the full sample of emsto clusters encompassing the range @xmath10 myr for this spread .",
    "additional support has come from several directions .",
    "@xcite noted the presence of a dual red clump in ngc 419 and in a number of the rich lmc emsto clusters , while @xcite used the complete observed cmds for ngc 419 and ngc 1751 to reconstruct their star - formation histories  finding that these may have spanned an incredible @xmath11 myr ( out of a mean age of @xmath12 gyr ) in ngc 419 , and @xmath13 myr in ngc 1751 .",
    "@xcite noted that in their best - fitting models the dual red clumps in both ngc 419 and ngc 1751 arise as a direct result of the age dispersions in these systems .",
    "@xcite posited that rather than reflecting an internal age spread , a cluster emsto might instead arise if a wide range in stellar rotation is present at the msto .",
    "however , models by @xcite demonstrated that the effects of stellar rotation fail to reproduce the emsto morphology ; in addition , as emphasised by @xcite , this scenario does not seem able to account for the dual red clumps observed in ngc 419 , ngc 1751 , and some other emsto clusters .",
    "@xcite also tested the effects of star - to - star variations in the degree of convective overshooting on a cluster cmd , but found that this too failed to accurately reproduce the characteristic emsto shape .",
    "the global properties of emsto clusters provide some clues as to how these systems may arise .",
    "@xcite made the simple observation that it is only the intermediate - age clusters with present - day masses greater than @xmath14 that exhibit emstos .",
    "@xcite further observed that the known emsto systems are , without exception , the most diffuse , spatially extended clusters for their age . in the framework of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "magellanic cloud clusters exhibit an increasing spread in size ( defined by either the core or half - light radius ) with age ;",
    "@xcite showed that at intermediate ages the emsto clusters all fall towards the upper envelope of this distribution , while clusters without an emsto appear systematically more compact .",
    "@xcite used detailed @xmath15-body models to explore the origin of the increasing spread in magellanic cloud cluster sizes with age .",
    "they found that if very young massive clusters are formed as compact dense systems , as is seen to be the case in both the lmc and smc , the only viable way for them to evolve along the upper envelope of the observed age - size distribution on a @xmath16 gyr time - scale is due to mass - loss from stellar evolution _",
    "if they were initially highly mass segregated _  that is , with the highest mass stars preferentially located towards the cluster centers gyr .",
    "note also that @xcite found that a flat , or top - heavy imf can lead to cluster expansion along the upper envelope of the age - size distribution ; however such clusters rapidly become unbound ( after just a few@xmath17 yr ) . in addition , young magellanic cloud clusters are seen to have quite normal imfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this in turn implies that , in addition to being the most massive intermediate - age clusters in the magellanic clouds , emsto systems were also probably the most strongly mass segregated clusters at early times .",
    "there is clearly a link between cluster mass and structure , and the presence of an emsto .",
    "there are two additional observations of relevance .",
    "if a cut is made on the cmd across a cluster s emsto in a direction perpendicular to the locus of the upper main sequence , then groups of `` younger '' and `` older '' msto stars may be defined .",
    "these groups have distinct properties .",
    "first , as noted by @xcite , the younger population consists of at least as many stars as the older population  in fact the ratio is typically more like @xmath18:@xmath19 in the richest clusters .",
    "second , as described in detail by @xcite , the younger population is often more centrally concentrated than the older population .",
    "the strongest difference between the two concentrations is seen in the clusters possessing the largest estimated _ initial _ escape velocities ( i.e. , @xmath20  km@xmath21s@xmath22 at an age of @xmath23 myr ) ; systems in which @xmath24  km@xmath21s@xmath22 do not show this difference in central concentrations , or are not seen to possess an emsto at all ( note that the limiting velocity here is comparable to the velocities of winds from frms or agb stars ) .",
    "this picture is fully consistent with the idea discussed above that emsto clusters were both the most massive and the most strongly mass segregated clusters at the time when they were formed .    as speculated by a number of authors",
    "@xcite , the properties of emsto systems suggest a formation process remarkably similar to that inferred for the multi - population galactic globular clusters  specifically , that prolonged star formation has occurred at the centres of these objects because their masses and initial structures allowed the retention or accumulation of a suitable reservoir of gas at the bottom of the cluster potential well .",
    "the observed internal age spreads of several hundred myr in emsto clusters , and the apparently minimal dispersions in iron abundance inferred from their narrow rgb sequences are both consistent with the scenario invoked for galactic globular clusters in which much of this reservoir comes from the slow winds of a first generation of agb stars .",
    "furthermore , the number ratio of younger to older groups of stars in emsto clusters is comparable to that seen for the two generations in galactic globular clusters .",
    "note that it has not been clearly assessed how early ideas for the formation of emsto systems , such as the merging of two bound clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the merger of a cluster and a giant molecular cloud @xcite , fit with the observed properties of emsto systems .",
    "however , if the star formation has indeed progressed unbroken over several hundred myr as suggested by @xcite or @xcite , these scenarios are likely disfavored .",
    "if , as hypothesized , emsto clusters and galactic globular clusters share a common formation process , a key prediction is that emsto clusters ought to harbor similar star - to - star variations in the abundances of light elements as seen in the galactic systems .",
    "a complicating factor is the comparatively high overall metallicity of the emsto clusters ( @xmath25m@xmath26h@xmath27\\approx -0.4 $ ] ) , along with the possibility that their central gas resevoirs may have been augmented by an unknown amount of accreted pristine material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  so the scale of these variations is difficult to predict .",
    "very few light element abundance measurements exist for emsto systems .",
    "the most extensive study is that by @xcite who targeted between @xmath28 and @xmath9 stars in each of four intermediate - age lmc clusters , of which only one ( ngc 1783 ) unambiguously features an emsto .",
    "for all four systems , mucciarelli et al . assert that the star - to - star scatter in each of the @xmath29 elemental abundances they measure is negligible ; in particular , there are no o - na or mg - al anti - correlations evident .",
    "however , the interpretation of these measurements is somewhat controversial  both @xcite and @xcite note that the star - to - star scatter in the listed abundances of sodium is larger than the observational uncertainties at a statistically significant level ( up to @xmath30 ) for some clusters .",
    "even so , the sole emsto cluster in the study , ngc 1783 , does not seem to exhibit elemental abundance patterns which are strikingly distinct from those of the other three systems .",
    "additional high resolution spectral data , for a larger sample of stars in a larger ensemble of emsto clusters , are clearly required to assess the viability of the link between these systems and the multi - population galactic globular clusters .",
    "such data possess an extra benefit beyond exploring elemental abundance patterns . because emsto clusters are diffuse , low - density stellar systems , their two - body relaxation times are typically comparable to , or longer than their ages ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , unlike for galactic globular clusters , the internal dynamics of emsto systems should still reflect the conditions present early on in their lives  so that any signature imparted onto the cluster kinematics by the formation process should be both detectable and straightforward to interpret .",
    "this paper is the first in a series devoted to a detailed study of medium and high resolution spectra for @xmath1 giant stars and one planetary nebula in the most massive known emsto cluster , and one of the best studied photometrically ",
    "ngc 1846 in the lmc .",
    "stellar populations in this cluster span the age range @xmath31 gyr , and its iron abundance is @xmath25fe@xmath26h@xmath27 \\approx -0.4 $ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aim of our study of ngc 1846 is two - fold : first , to characterise the internal dynamics of the cluster and search for any signatures of its formation that might be present ; and second , to place constraints on any star - to - star elemental abundance variations , especially for light elements . here , we present a detailed description of our target selection and data analysis ( sections [ s : data ] and [ s : member ] ) , and focus on the cluster kinematics ( sections [ s : kinematics ] and [ s : discuss ] ) .",
    "subsequent work will cover the elemental abundance analysis .",
    "we obtained spectra of stars in the vicinity of ngc 1846 using the flames instrument at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) on cerro paranal , chile , under programme 082.d-0387 ( pi : mackey ) .",
    "flames @xcite is a fiber - fed multi - object spectrograph mounted at the naysmith a platform of the 8.2 m unit telescope 2 ( kueyen ) .",
    "we employed the medusa - giraffe mode , allowing up to @xmath32 stars to be targeted across the @xmath33 diameter field of view in a single pointing .",
    "our target selection is discussed in detail in section [ ss : targets ] .",
    "we used just a single flames fiber configuration but observed at three high - resolution giraffe settings ( hr11 , hr13 , and hr14b ) and one low - resolution setting ( lr02 ) .",
    "the nominal wavelength coverage and spectral resolution for each of these set - ups is listed in table [ t : flames ] .",
    "this paper and the next in the series ( paper ii ) are dedicated to analysis of the observations obtained at the three hr settings ; results from the blue lr set - up will be reported in a separate future work .",
    "we obtained our data in visitor mode on the three nights 2008 november 29  december 01 .",
    "conditions were clear and stable , with seeing typically in the range @xmath34 . on each night",
    "we observed a given hr setting at the beginning and end of the night , and reserved an hour either side of ngc 1846 crossing the meridian for observing the blue lr set - up with minimal differential atmospheric refraction . for all four gratings we obtained @xmath35  min exposures . due to the faintness of our targets we switched the simultaneous calibration lamps off , instead bracketing each long science exposure with short calibration lamp exposures to ensure we could achieve an accurate wavelength solution .",
    "targets for our flames observations were drawn from the archival hst / acs imaging of ngc 1846 described in the introduction @xcite for the crowded central regions , and the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ) catalogue of the lmc @xcite for the surrounding field .        for work such as this",
    ", one would ideally directly target stars spread across the cluster emsto so that elemental abundances and dynamical properties can be correlated directly against position on the cmd .",
    "unfortunately , however , at @xmath36 , obtaining sufficient signal - to - noise for a high precision abundance analysis of ngc 1846 msto stars is beyond the capabilities of presently - available high - resolution spectrographs , even on the largest telescopes .",
    "instead , we are forced to target the brightest giant stars in the cluster .",
    "there is , however , no major disadvantage in doing so ",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the relative numbers of `` younger '' and `` older '' stars across the emsto are not too dissimilar ( a ratio of @xmath37:@xmath19 ) .",
    "this means that , providing a sufficiently large ensemble of giant stars is observed , the full spread in population parameters ( age and , if they exist , elemental abundance variations ) ought to be well sampled .",

    "the former is a `` snapshot '' program , where the imaging consists of just two exposures  @xmath53s in the f555w filter and @xmath54s in the f814w filter .",
    "the second program comprises a more extensive set of observations  three exposures in each of the f435w , f555w , and f814w filters , where two of the exposures were long ( @xmath55s each ) and one short ( @xmath56s , @xmath57s , and @xmath58s in the three filters , respectively ) .",
    "the two programs were observed with differing orientations , meaning that their footprints only partially overlap on the sky . in the interests of covering as much of the area around ngc 1846 as possible with high quality acs imaging and photometry , and hence maximising the number of objects in our input catalogue for flames target selection",
    ", we used the multidrizzle software @xcite to combine the complete set of f555w observations into a `` master '' reference image .",
    "this image increases the sky coverage near ngc 1846 by @xmath59 over what would have been available using only one of the hst programs .",
    "we next used the dolphot software @xcite , and in particular its acs module , to photometer all the available images . details of this procedure may be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , dolphot performs point - spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry using model psfs especially tailored for the acs camera .",
    "it works on images for which basic reduction steps have been applied ( bias and dark current subtraction , and flat - field division ) but which have not been distortion corrected ( drizzled ) .",
    "the software can photometer multiple images in multiple filters simultaneously , matching detections across images and deriving coordinates relative to an input reference frame  in our case the master drizzled f555w image .",
    "output photometry is on the calibrated vegamag scale of @xcite and has been corrected for charge - transfer efficiency degredation .",
    "where possible , transformations are also made into the standard johnson - cousins system . to obtain a clean list of stellar detections with high quality photometry we filtered our dolphot measurements using the classification , sharpness and crowding parameters ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "cmds , in both the @xmath60 and @xmath61 planes are shown in figure [ f : cmds ] .",
    "ngc 1846 is set against a relatively dense background of lmc field stars , so care was necessary in selecting our input catalogue for flames .",
    "we used cmds for stars within @xmath62 of the cluster center to filter out most of the field contamination , allowing us to define regions encompassing the upper red - giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) on both colour - magnitude planes .",
    "the colour and luminosity of a star on the rgb is sensitive to elemental abundances , especially that of iron , as well as to age .",
    "given that the primary aim of our vlt program was to test for possible star - to - star abundance variations , and that we also strongly suspect the presence of an internal age spread in ngc 1846 , we were particularly mindful not to define our target regions too restrictively .",
    "the red side of the ngc 1846 rgb is sharply defined on both cmd planes ; however to the blue there is potential for significant overlap between the rgb and agb sequences .",
    "hence we set the blue side of our target region rather conservatively , with the result there are likely a few agb stars in our flames sample .",
    "as long as these are early - agb objects ( i.e. , which have not yet undergone third dredge - up ) the composition of the atmospheres of these stars should not have been altered substantially through the addition of newly - processed material .",
    "this issue is not relevant to the cluster kinematics , but is discussed in more detail in paper ii .",
    "we set an absolute red limit to our target region of @xmath63 in order to exclude very cool giants for which it is more difficult to do a reliable abundance analysis .",
    "note that this also excluded the most luminous ( and evolved ) agb stars in the cluster .",
    "at the faint end we set a limit of @xmath64 , as spectra for stars fainter than this would not have sufficiently high signal - to - noise . on the @xmath60 plane , the corresponding limits were @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "having defined our target regions we selected as our cluster input catalogue all stars across the full acs field of view which lay within these regions on both colour - magnitude planes .",
    "as noted above , nearly a third of the field is not covered by f435w imaging  we filtered objects in this area using only the @xmath61 plane .",
    "the very outer parts of the acs field were only sparsely populated with suitable stars , so we supplemented the input catalogue in this region with stars lying up to @xmath67 mag to the red of our target region on the cmd .",
    "we also added to the catalogue a nearby planetary nebula likely belonging to ngc 1846 , mo-17 ( see section [ ss : pn ] ) .",
    "we searched for , and removed from the catalogue any stars with neighbours within a radius of @xmath68 that were sufficiently bright as to be likely to interfere with the spectrum of the target .",
    "we used eso s fibre positioner observation support software ( fposs ) to determine the optimal medusa configuration for our flames observations .",
    "a few trial runs using our acs input catalogue demonstrated that we would be able to observe , at most , @xmath69 stars within @xmath70 of the center of ngc 1846  the limiting factor being the minimum fiber - to - fiber separation of @xmath71 . even allowing for @xmath72 sky fibers and @xmath73 fibers allocated to hot blue stars to allow correction of telluric absorption ( see below ) ,",
    "this left roughly @xmath74 fibers unused .",
    "rather than waste these we decided to allocate them to bright field rgb stars spread evenly over the non - cluster regions of the @xmath33 diameter flames field of view .",
    "we selected these objects from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ) catalogue of the lmc ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this catalogue provides precise astrometry and @xmath75 photometry of stars in the central @xmath76 deg@xmath77 of the lmc , and , for some subset of successfully cross - matched stars , @xmath78 photometry from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue @xcite .",
    "there were a sufficiently large number of mcps stars with 2mass matches across our field of view that we were able to draw targets exclusively from this subset .",
    "the 2mass measurements were particularly useful for distinguishing between field rgb and agb stars , as shown in figure [ f : mcps ] ( left panel ) .",
    "we selected rgb stars brighter than @xmath79 for our mcps input catalogue ( figure [ f : mcps ] , right panel ) .",
    "available literature measurements suggested that the ngc 1846 radial velocity of @xmath80 km@xmath21s@xmath22 @xcite would bring the forbidden @xmath25oi@xmath27 $ ] line at @xmath81  into close proximity with telluric absorption features due to atmospheric o@xmath82 .",
    "we planned to derive our oxygen abundances using primarily this line ( see paper ii ) ; in order to be able to account for the telluric absorption we required spectra of hot , preferably fast - rotating stars at high s / n . to this end , we selected a number of target stars from the mcps catalogue that appeared to be bright members of the young blue lmc field main sequence ( see figure [ f : mcps ] ) .    to aid in the subtraction of atmospheric emission lines from our science spectra",
    ", we also decided to allocate @xmath83 fibers to blank sky .",
    "we placed these such that for a given sky fiber there were no objects in the mcps catalogue lying within @xmath84 .",
    "ideally these sky positions would be local to our highest priority targets ( i.e. , ngc 1846 members ) ; however the very tightly packed nature of the fiber configuration in the middle of the flames field meant that it was impossible to allocate any other fibers within @xmath85 of the cluster center .",
    "this ultimately led to some problems achieving a high quality sky subtraction for many of our targets ; however it was not difficult to accommodate these issues in our analysis ( section [ ss : reduction ] ) .    finally , we merged our acs and mcps catalogues for input to fposs .",
    "the critical step was to transform the acs coordinates onto the mcps ( fk5 ) astrometric frame .",
    "although the relative astrometry of targets measured from the acs imaging is extremely precise ( of order milli - arcseconds ) , the hst fits header information from which the absolute astrometry is derived can be in error by up to several arcseconds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  more than enough for",
    "the medusa fibres to miss these targets entirely .",
    "we cross - matched @xmath86 stars across the acs master reference image with stars in the full mcps lmc catalogue , excluding the crowded central cluster region , and used these to derive a suitable coordinate transformation onto the mcps frame .    having",
    "successfully merged our two lists of potential targets , we used fposs to determine the optimal fiber configuration . in doing so",
    ", we assigned priorities to the various classes of target  for example , acs stars received higher priority than mcps stars and sky positions .",
    "the acs stars themselves were graded in priority by luminosity ( the brighter the better ) , distance from the center of the cluster ( the smaller the better ) , and , weakly , by colour on the rgb ( the redder the better ) .",
    "our final configuration targeted @xmath87 acs stars ( @xmath9 within @xmath88 of the cluster center ) , the planetary nebula mo-17 , @xmath89 mcps field rgb stars , @xmath90 mcps stars for correcting telluric absorption , and @xmath8 blank sky positions .",
    "we observed our blue lr setting using flames fiber positioner plate 1 and the three hr settings using plate 2 . on both plates ,",
    "spectra from two fibers ( both targeting mcps stars ) fell off the edge of the ccds and were lost .",
    "additionally , two of the plate 2 fibers were broken leading to the loss of another mcps star and one acs target .",
    "hence , the hr observations presented here resulted in spectra for @xmath91 mcps stars and @xmath92 acs stars , as well as the other targets and sky positions listed above .",
    "we used the eso public giraffe pipeline recipes v2.8.1 , operating under the graphical front - end software gasgano , to perform a basic reduction of all our science frames  that is , bias subtraction , fiber localization , optimal extraction of spectra , division by a normalized flat - field image ( i.e. , including correction for fiber - to - fiber transmission differences ) , an initial wavelength calibration , and rebinning to a uniform linearized dispersion scale ( @xmath93  per pixel for the spectra considered here ) . for each of the four instrumental set - ups ,",
    "the science frames included the six on - target exposures as well as the short bracketing exposures with the calibration lamps on . for science frames belonging to a given set - up ,",

    "after the basic data reduction had been completed , we used the measured positions of emission lines in the bracketing calibration frames to check for small residual wavelength drifts in each of the on - target exposures individually .",
    "next , we intended to perform a sky subtraction on each individual spectrum of an object , along with a correction for telluric absorption , before combining these spectra into a final product .",
    "we note that sky subtraction is only marginally important for the hr11 set - up , which covers a handful of weak emission lines ; however the hr13 and hr14b set - ups both cover numerous bright emission lines .",

    "improved the results marginally , but not to a satisfactory level . the origin of the problem is unclear , but it may well be linked to our inability to place sky fibers very locally to the ngc 1846 targets , as described in section [ ss : targets ] .    to work around this issue",
    "we used the iraf task scombine to merge all @xmath97 sky spectra for a given set - up ( @xmath8 sky fibers from each of @xmath90 exposures ) into a high s / n `` master '' spectrum , and used this to generate a mask specifying all of the narrow wavelength intervals affected by sky lines . across the wavelength range of the hr13 set - up",
    "there were @xmath98 such intervals in the mask , covering @xmath99 of any given spectrum , while for hr14b there were @xmath100 sky - line intervals excising @xmath101 of the coverage and for hr11 there were @xmath58 intervals masking @xmath102 . when detecting and measuring stellar absorption features for our kinematic and chemical abundance analysis , we simply ignored any lines lying within one resolution element ( @xmath103 ) of a masked sky region .",
    "as described in paper ii , this procedure did not reject any lines critical for examining the abundance of a given element , but did ensure that any lines impacted by sky emission did not adversely influence our measurements .",
    "we encountered a similar problem when attempting to correct for telluric absorption in the hr13 set - up .",
    "four of our six bright blue targets turned out to be suitable stars for this type of correction ; however despite trying a similar variety of techniques as for the sky subtraction , we could not consistently achieve a high quality correction across the full affected wavelength range . ultimately , we adpoted an identical approach to our sky - line solution  we normalised then combined the @xmath104 telluric star exposures into a high s / n master spectrum and used this to generate a mask specifying the intervals affected by atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "there were @xmath105 such intervals covering @xmath106 of the hr13 wavelength range ; we note some overlap between the telluric and sky - line masks . again , during our kinematic and chemical abundance analysis we simply ignored any stellar lines lying within one resolution element of a masked telluric - line region .",
    "as described in more detail in paper ii , the only critical stellar line rejected by this procedure was the @xmath25oi@xmath27 $ ] line at @xmath81 , which , for ngc 1846 targets , is redshifted onto a telluric feature near @xmath107 . in order to use this line , we applied our master spectrum and the iraf task telluric to obtain a high - quality correction to only the @xmath107  feature , and then used these specially tailored spectra when deriving oxygen abundances .    finally , we corrected all on - target spectra to the heliocentric frame using the iraf tasks rvcorrect and dopcor .",
    "we then median - combined the six exposures of a given target in a given set - up using the iraf task scombine . best results ( including cosmic ray removal )",

    "we applied our sky and telluric masks to cull affected lines from the list .",

    "typically , @xmath128 lines were identified in each hr11 spectrum , @xmath129 lines in each hr13 spectrum and @xmath130 lines in each hr14b spectrum ; however significant variation was seen as a function of s / n and the effective temperature of the target . in the majority of cases",
    "the line - by - line variance for each individual radial velocity estimate was in the range @xmath131  km@xmath21s@xmath22 ; we conservatively adopted this quantity to represent the uncertainty on each such measurement .    while checking our results we noticed the presence of small systematic offsets between velocities measured for a given star from different settings .",

    "the origin of these offsets is not clear , but they were straightforward to correct . for each setting we precisely measured the positions of all the atmospheric emission features in each of the @xmath8 blank sky spectra .",

    "the magnitude of the rotation we infer in ngc 1846 is roughly comparable to the mean velocity dispersion in the system , which is quite unusual for a stellar cluster ( see section [ s : discuss ] , below ) . because of the potential significance of this observation , it is important to thoroughly assess the robustness of our kinematic analysis .",
    "there are two main reasons why it is necessary to undertake such a check .",
    "first , our sample of dynamical probes is comparatively small and so it is not inconceivable that , for example , a chance arrangement of velocity and position angle among a few stars could lead to a false rotation detection .",
    "second , ngc 1846 has a non - neglibigle binary star fraction ( note the strong binary star main sequences seen in the two cmds in figure [ f : cmds ] ) and so for a subset of stars in our ensemble the observed velocities likely possess extra components due to stellar companions rather than constituting a pure representation of the cluster kinematics .    to investigate these issues we developed @xmath515 sets of @xmath516 random realizations of our measured sample , and calculated for each set ( i ) how frequently we detected a rotation signal comparable to that observed for ngc 1846 ; and ( ii ) the mean ensemble velocity dispersion .",
    "we characterized a given set of models according to the assumed properties of its binary star population .",

    "each realization consisted of @xmath417 targets at identical radii to our real sample , but at random position angles and with random velocities generated according to a well - defined set of rules .",
    "it could be argued that the radius assigned to each star should also be randomly selected , according to the density profile of ngc 1846 .",
    "however , our measured sample is not solely defined by this density profile  rather it is the profile convolved with some complex and essentially unknown selection function for input to flames ( see section [ ss : targets ] ) . in the absence of this information , we felt the most sensible option was to maintain the radial distribution of the observed sample for each mock system .",
    "for each target we first assigned a base velocity by selecting randomly from a gaussian distribution of width specified by equation [ e : plummer ] with @xmath462 and @xmath517  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , evaluated at the appropriate radius . to this we added a random gaussian",
    "deviate to represent the observational uncertainty , exactly as in section [ ss : rotation ] .",
    "next , we randomly assigned the star to be an unresolved binary , or not , according to the assumed binary fraction for the overall set to which the mock realization belonged . if a star was selected to be a binary we randomly generated a set of parameters to characterize the system , again according to the properties of the overall set , leading to an additional component to add to the base velocity .",
    "if , however , a star was not selected to be a binary , no further modification of its base velocity was made .",
    "note that the planetary nebula mo-17 was never selected to be a binary ( since our velocity for this object comes from the nebula itself rather than the central star ) , but was otherwise treated identically to the other @xmath1 stars in the sample .",
    "binary systems are characterized by the masses of the two components , @xmath518 and @xmath519 ( where the mass of the primary @xmath520 ) , the orbital period @xmath521 , and the orbital eccentricity @xmath522 .",

    "next , we determined the orientation of the binary by selecting the angles @xmath412 and @xmath526 from uniform distributions . finally , we selected a number in the range @xmath635 , also according to a uniform distribution , to represent the elapsed fraction of the binary s orbital period since periastron , and converted this into the phase @xmath527 by numerically solving kepler s equation .",

    "[ e : binvel ] . to mimic our original identification of cluster members ( section [ ss : memstar ] ) , if the resulting velocity of the star was separated from the systemic cluster velocity by more than five times the velocity dispersion at that radius , we returned and regenerated all its binary parameters .",
    "the results for all @xmath515 sets of realizations are presented in table [ t : mocks ] . to illustrate our analysis procedure we consider set 1  the control set with zero binary fraction .",
    "we quantified whether the inferred rotation of a mock system matched that observed for the real cluster , by using the amplitude of rotation and two quality of fit parameters .",
    "as described in section [ ss : rotation ] , the rotation velocity implied by the ngc 1846 curve shown in the top panel of figure [ f : rotate ] is @xmath636  km@xmath21s@xmath22 .",
    "the curve is , further , a high quality sinusoid , suggesting that the inferred rotation is not simply due to stochastic deviations from zero at a few position angles .",
    "the rms residual for the best - fitting model is @xmath637 , and the coefficient of determination @xmath638 .",
    "just @xmath639 of our mock systems in set 1 had inferred rotation of matching or greater amplitude than that measured for ngc 1846 ; however only about a tenth of these ( @xmath640 of all systems ) also had an rms residual value equal to or smaller than the best - fit model for ngc 1846",
    ". a slightly larger fraction ( @xmath641 of all systems ) had matching or greater rotation amplitude together with an @xmath642 value equal to or greater than our best - fit model . considering the lower bound on our ngc 1846 rotation amplitude of @xmath643  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , defined by the uncertaintly on the measurement , the fraction of mock systems with matching or greater amplitude rose to @xmath644 .",
    "again , however , only a small subset of these also had an equivalently high - quality rms value ( @xmath645 of all systems ) or @xmath642 value ( @xmath646 of all systems ) .",
    "to give a visual indication of the goodness - of - fit criteria , we show in figure [ f : mocks ] several examples ( taken from set 17 , see below ) where a rotation amplitude greater than that measured for ngc 1846 is inferred , but where the rms and/or the @xmath642 values indicate a poor quality sinusoid .",
    "it is quite clear that these systems would not be mistaken for one in which a strong rotation signal had been reliably detected .",
    "we also show one example where stochastic fluctuations have resulted in a rotation curve that passess all our tests , and would have led to a false positive detection of rotation in the cluster . fortunately ,",
    "as outlined in table [ t : mocks ] , this is a rare occurrence .",
    "for each random realization of our sample we also calculated the mean velocity dispersion using the maximum likelihood technique described previously .",
    "we then found the average dispersion across all random realizations in a given set , along with the standard deviation in this value .",
    "the mean systemic velocity for each random realization is a natural by - product of the maximum likelihood calculation , and for completeness we determined the average value for this quantity across each set as well .",
    "the results of this process are visible in table [ t : mocks ] . for the control set 1 ,",
    "we recover an average systemic velocity and velocity dispersion precisely matching those values derived for ngc 1846 , including the uncertainties .",
    "this is to be expected , since the control run is the trivial case of re - measuring systems generated according to the velocity dispersion profile seen in figure [ f : dispersion ] , with no contribution from binary stars .",
    "we now consider the results for sets @xmath647 , which possess binary population characteristics as outlined in table [ t : mocks ] .",
    "as expected , the additional velocity components due to the orbital motions of binary pairs do have some influence on our kinematic measurements .",
    "however , the effects do not appear to be strongly dependent on the adopted distributions for the orbital period or eccentricity . changing the distribution for the mass ratio , @xmath630 ,",
    "has a more significant effect ; however this is most likely due to the resulting change in the inferred binary fraction in the cluster  more binaries imply a stronger influence on the kinematic measurements .",
    "in terms of the inferred rotation , an increased percentage of the mock systems have amplitudes of matching or greater amplitude than our ngc 1846 measurement . for @xmath648",
    "these values lie in the range @xmath649 , while for @xmath650 they are higher , @xmath651 . as before ,",
    "however , only a very small subset of these systems possess high quality sinusoidal rotation curves  the overall fractions are less than @xmath652 for both goodness - of - fit criteria in all cases .",
    "once again considering the conservative case defined by @xmath653  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , the percentages all rise ; however the overall fraction of systems in each set with a high amplitude and high - quality rotation curve is again always close to or below @xmath654 .",
    "the mean kinematics of each set of models are interesting .",
    "binaries have no effect on the average systemic velocity , which always comes out at the measured ngc 1846 value .",
    "this is because the extra binary component of an individual radial velocity is equally likely to be pointing towards , or away from , the observer .",
    "however the binary stars do appreciably inflate the mean cluster velocity dispersion . in the case where @xmath648 the mean dispersion goes from @xmath655  km@xmath21s@xmath22 to nearly @xmath656  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , while for @xmath650 the dispersion is typically just above @xmath657  km@xmath21s@xmath22 . as with the rotation measures ,",
    "these values are not strongly dependent on the adopted distributions for the orbital period or eccentricity .",
    "( see text ) . in the lower panel",
    "we show one rare example of a high quality curve arising purely by chance .",
    "this particular realization had the best quality fit of all @xmath516 mock systems in set 17.[f : mocks],width=325 ]    in summary , we draw the following conclusions from our monte carlo simulations . first , while it is not impossible for rotation signals comparable to that which we measured for ngc 1846 to arise stochastically , it is a very unusual occurrence with @xmath658 of systems in any given set exhibiting such characteristics .",
    "the presence of unresolved binary stars increases the number of systems for which a high amplitude of rotation could be inferred ; however the rotation curves for such systems would invariably not be mistaken for the expected sinusoidal variation of velocity with position angle .",
    "thus , while we can not rule out that the rotation we have observed in ngc 1846 is simply down to statistical fluke , we are better than @xmath659 confident that it is a genuine signal .",
    "second , it is likely that our measured velocity dispersion for ngc 1846 , @xmath442 , along with our inferred central velocity dispersion @xmath451 , are both inflated above their true values due to the presence of unresolved binary stars in our sample . in our simulations , an input value of @xmath660  km@xmath21s@xmath22",
    "is increased to at most @xmath661  km@xmath21s@xmath22 . since the various sources of dispersion add in quadrature , this implies the true @xmath442 could be as low as @xmath662  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , and the true @xmath451 as low as @xmath663  km@xmath21s@xmath22 . by comparison ,",
    "our typical measurement uncertainty of @xmath664  km@xmath21s@xmath22 on each individual velocity inflates the true dispersions by less than @xmath665  km@xmath21s@xmath22 ( note that this contribution is accounted for by the maximum likelihood technique we employed to measure the cluster dispersion ) .",
    "the key point of interest arising from our analysis of the internal kinematics of ngc 1846 concerns the degree of systemic rotation , which appears high compared with , for example , many milky way globular clusters , or indeed the few magellanic cloud clusters for which such measurements exist .",
    "we find a ratio @xmath666 if we adopt the mean amplitude of rotation @xmath667  km@xmath21s@xmath22 .",
    "however , we also demonstrated that the maximum amplitude of rotation in ngc 1846 might well be as high as @xmath37  km@xmath21s@xmath22 ( especially since there is the additional unknown factor @xmath411 required to deproject our rotation measurement  note that the mean value of @xmath411 assuming a uniform distribution of inclination angles is @xmath668 ) . in this case , @xmath669 .",
    "we also showed that unresolved binary stars in our sample probably inflate the measured velocity dispersion by up to @xmath670  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , implying that the fraction of ordered motion with respect to pressure support is likely to be even larger still , @xmath671 .",
    "these latter two estimates are commensurate with the highest ratios measured in the sample of @xmath104 galactic globular clusters compiled by @xcite ; indeed even our lower limit of @xmath672 would place ngc 1846 in the top @xmath673 of this sample .",
    "they are also somewhat larger than the values measured for young magellanic cloud clusters .",
    "@xcite found @xmath674 in the @xmath129 myr old cluster ngc 1866 , while @xcite measured a comparable degree of rotation in the @xmath675 myr old cluster ngc 1850 .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured @xmath676 for the very young ( @xmath677 myr ) massive cluster r136 at the centre of 30 doradus .",
    "notably , however , the only other intermediate - age lmc cluster investigated on a star - by - star basis , ngc 1978 , shows no significant evidence for rotation @xcite .    when comparing the degree of internal rotation in ngc 1846 with rotation seen in galactic globular clusters , it is important to bear in mind that ngc 1846 is still dynamically quite young .",
    "as demonstrated in section [ ss : relax ] , its central and median relaxation times are greater than the cluster age .",
    "it is possible , even likely , that these time - scales were much shorter early on in the cluster s evolution ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however it is clear that in the ancient galactic globular clusters any ordered motions have had far more opportunity to become randomized , thus surpressing @xmath678 relative to ngc 1846 .",
    "this is not the case for the young lmc clusters ngc 1850 and 1866 , and r136 , which , like ngc 1846 , should be dynamically unevolved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that the degree of rotation observed in ngc 1846 is , arguably , greater than in these young systems is a striking result . if , as we suspect , @xmath679 then ordered rotation is comparable in importance to random motions in providing support against gravitational collapse . following the discussion in @xcite , for this range in @xmath680 , between @xmath681 of the total cluster kinetic energy would be in rotation .",
    "ngc 1846 is only mildly elliptical ",
    "@xcite measure @xmath682 . however , a cluster s ellipticity is not necessarily a good indication of its degree of internal rotation .",
    "@xcite found no correlation between these two quantities in their sample of galactic globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , the lone globular cluster associated with the isolated local group dwarf irregular galaxy wlm , shows no evidence for strong internal rotation despite displaying a high degree of ellipticity @xcite .",
    "ngc 1978 , for which @xcite found no evident signs of rotation , also has a very flattened shape with @xmath683 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for galactic globular clusters @xmath678 correlates quite strongly with @xmath25fe@xmath26h@xmath27 $ ] , such that more metal - rich systems have stronger internal rotation . with @xmath25fe@xmath26h@xmath27 \\approx",
    "-0.4 $ ] , ngc 1846 fits this correlation well , although we again caution that we are comparing dynamically evolved systems with a dynamically young system .",
    "the suggestion made by @xcite is that the observed correlation between @xmath25fe@xmath26h@xmath27 $ ] and @xmath678 may hint that dissipative gas dynamics plays a significant role in the process of cluster formation , due to the fact that a larger metal content in a gas should imply a higher efficiency in energy dissipation via atomic transitions .",
    "this idea is particularly relevant to the present case , where we strongly suspect the presence of multiple stellar generations in ngc 1846 .",
    "@xcite uses hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of a second generation of stars at the centre of a globular cluster following the accretion of gas ( including agb ejecta ) into its potential well ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "he finds that if the first generation of stars possesses even a very small net angular momentum , gaseous dissipation during accretion onto the cluster center leads to a dynamically cold , rapidly rotating second generation with @xmath684 .",
    "the second generation is initially very centrally concentrated but this nested structure , and the strong rotational signature , ought to be smoothed out as a result of relaxation processes during the subsequent long term evolution of the cluster .",
    "since ngc 1846 is , dynamically speaking , still quite young , both the central concentration of the younger generation ( as measured by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the rotational kinematics ( as seen in the present work ) , are apparently still evident . our possible detection of increasing rotation towards the cluster center is also consistent with this picture .    a more sensitive test of the model described above would be achieved if we could split our kinematic sample into earlier and later generations ; however , to presage the results of our chemical abundance analysis somewhat ( see paper ii ) , there is no obvious marker for achieving this  and in any case the present ensemble is probably too small for useful subdivision .",
    "the most reliable method would be to target a large number of stars across the emsto in order to directly correlate kinematics against position on the cmd and within the cluster .",
    "such measurements , if at all possible , would require a considerable investment of telescope time but would provide critical information to test the different formation hypotheses .    nonetheless , the fact that we have detected strong rotation in the first emsto cluster subjected to detailed dynamical examination is suggestive that this may be an important feature of these systems . in future",
    "it will be critically important to enlarge the sample of intermediate - age magellanic cloud clusters for which internal kinematics have been measured , including both systems with and without an emsto .",
    "realistic @xmath15-body modelling of clusters such as those predicted by hydrodynamic simulations , in which there is a centrally - concentrated , strongly - rotating second generation of stars embedded in a more diffuse , pressure supported first generation , would also be extremely useful ( although we recognize the current limitations placed on such models due to the maximum particle number of @xmath685 ) .",
    "an issue of particular interest is how the spatial and kinematic distinctions between the different generations propagate through the dynamical evolution of the system , especially where the cluster is strongly mass segregated at early times such that violent relaxation due to rapid stellar mass - loss drives significant expansion , as appears to be necessary for the intermediate - age emsto clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we have described a detailed set of vlt / flames observations of red giant stars in the peculiar intermediate - age lmc star cluster ngc 1846 , along with the data reduction procedure we employed to extract and process individual spectra . in total , we targeted @xmath92 stars within the nominal boundary of ngc 1846 , of which @xmath1 possess radial velocities indicating their membership of the cluster at high confidence .",
    "in addition , we targeted the planetary nebula mo-17 , and the radial velocity of this object indicates that it too is a member of the cluster .",
    "we have used our spectra to investigate the elemental abundance patterns present in ngc 1846 , including the possibility of star - to - star variations in light element abundances .",
    "these results will be presented in a forthcoming work ( paper ii ) . in the present paper",
    "we took the radial velocity measurements for our sample and used these to conduct a thorough analysis of the internal kinematics of the cluster , with the following results :    * ngc 1846 exhibits a significant degree of systemic rotation .",
    "the mean amplitude is @xmath667  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , with the rotation axis oriented at @xmath686 east of north .",
    "there are indications that the rotation signal may vary with position in the cluster such that the amplitude increases towards the center and peaks somewhere within the half - light radius .",
    "the maximum amplitude may well be as high as @xmath687  km@xmath21s@xmath22 , especially considering that there is also a correction factor @xmath411 for the unknown inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight .",
    "an extensive suite of monte carlo models suggests that , because of the relatively small size of our sample and the presence of a significant population of unresolved binary stars in ngc 1846 , stochastic fluctuations could reproduce the observed rotation curve ; however this only occurs very rarely  less than @xmath688 of the time if no binaries are present , or less than @xmath689 of the time for a cluster binary fraction of up to @xmath650 . *",
    "we measure a mean velocity dispersion @xmath449  km@xmath21s@xmath22 . assuming a simple parametrization of the velocity dispersion fall - off with radius , the implied central velocity dispersion in the cluster is @xmath463  km@xmath21s@xmath22 .",
    "our monte carlo modeling suggests that the presence of unresolved binary stars in our sample could substantially inflate these quantities . if the binary fraction @xmath650 , the true values could be as low as @xmath690  km@xmath21s@xmath22 and @xmath691  km@xmath21s@xmath22 . *",
    "the ratio of ordered motion to pressure support is formally @xmath666 ; however , accounting for the probable maximum amplitude of rotation in the cluster , the inclination factor @xmath411 , and the contribution of binary stars to inflating the observed velocity dispersion , this quantity is likely to be as high as @xmath692 . in this case , between @xmath681 of the total cluster kinetic energy",
    "would be in rotation .",
    "* under the assumption that mass follows light in the cluster , the mass of ngc 1846 is @xmath693 and the implied mass - to - light ratio is @xmath694 , consistent with predictions made purely on consideration of its consitutent stellar populations .",
    "note , however , that these quantities are derived assuming a `` dispersion - only '' cluster ( eq . [ e : plummer2 ] ) .",
    "if internal rotation provides an important contribution against gravitational collapse , as seems probable , more sophisticated modelling will be required to obtain reliable estimates of mass and @xmath499 . *",
    "the median relaxation time for ngc 1846 is @xmath513 gyr , indicating that the cluster is dynamically youthful .",
    "hence any kinematic signatures encoded during its formation ought to remain present .",
    "the observation that substantial rotation is present in ngc 1846 , at a magnitude comparable to that of the velocity dispersion , is consistent with the predictions of simulations modeling the formation of multiple generations in globular clusters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it would be of significant interest to improve our knowledge of the internal kinematics of this cluster by extending the present work to a much larger sample , ideally one in which the multiple generations could be easily identified .",
    "similarly , by extending our analysis to additional intermediate - age magellanic cloud clusters , both with and without the extended main - sequence turn - off morphology , we could hope to learn whether strong internal rotation is a key signature of the formation of clusters with multiple constituent stellar populations .",

    "<S> in this paper we present high resolution vlt / flames observations of red giant stars in the massive intermediate - age large magellanic cloud star cluster ngc 1846 , which , on the basis of its extended main - sequence turn - off ( emsto ) , possesses an internal age spread of @xmath0 myr . </S>",
    "<S> we describe in detail our target selection and data reduction procedures , and construct a sample of @xmath1 stars possessing radial velocities indicating their membership of ngc 1846 at high confidence . </S>",
    "<S> we consider high - resolution spectra of the planetary nebula mo-17 , and conclude that this object is also a member of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> our measured radial velocities allow us to conduct a detailed investigation of the internal kinematics of ngc 1846 , the first time this has been done for an emsto system . </S>",
    "<S> the key result of this work is that the cluster exhibits a significant degree of systemic rotation , of a magnitude comparable to the mean velocity dispersion . using an extensive suite of monte carlo models </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , despite our relatively small sample size and the substantial fraction of unresolved binary stars in the cluster , the rotation signal we detect is very likely to be genuine . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of simulations modeling the formation of multiple populations of stars in globular clusters , where a dynamically cold , rapidly rotating second generation is a common feature . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 1846 is less than one relaxation time old , so any dynamical signatures encoded during its formation ought to remain present . </S>"
