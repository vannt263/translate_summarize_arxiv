    "<S> we introduce a self - passivation of single lead ( pb ) and oxygen ( o ) vacancies in the @xmath0-pbo compound through formation of a pb - o vacancy pair . </S>",
    "<S> the preferential mechanism for pair formation involves initial development of the single pb vacancy which , by weakening the covalent bonding , sets up the crystal lattice for an appearance of the o vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> binding of the pb and o vacancies occurs through the ionization interactions . </S>",
    "<S> since no dangling bonds appear at the pb - o pair site , this defect has a minor effect on the electronic properties . in such </S>",
    "<S> , vacancy self - passivation offers a practical way to improve the transport properties in thermally grown pbo layers .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.5truecm    polycrystalline lead oxide ( pbo ) is one of the few photoconductive materials with a long- more than 60 years - history of employment in imaging devices . </S>",
    "<S> although pbo is extensively used as a photoconductor , very little is known about the electronic properties and charge transport in this material . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed that transport in pbo is controlled by trapping in defects and that trapping is a cause of low mobility - time product @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nature of defects is not fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> emerging applications of pbo in the direct conversion flat panel radiation medical imaging detectors revived the interest in studying defects in this material as defects can significantly affect imaging performance @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our recent modeling of the native point defects in @xmath0-pbo @xcite has shown that thermally deposited pbo layers should contain a significant concentration of single vacancies due to their moderate formation energies . </S>",
    "<S> single vacancies are amphoteric defects appearing in the different charge states . in the neutral charge state , </S>",
    "<S> the o vacancy ( @xmath1 ) holds two electrons and forms the deep donor level . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral pb vacancy ( @xmath2 ) is filled with holes , and is a shallow acceptor . </S>",
    "<S> it was established that these vacancies prefer to appear doubly ionized , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , acting as compensating centres to each other . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , two compensating vacancies have a lower formation energy than neutral ones , such as @xmath5- @xmath6=0.78 ev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that vacancies prefer to appear in charge states suggests that we have to consider the ionization interactions between them and the formation of a neutral vacancy pair @xmath7 instead of two separate compensating vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> this should further decrease the formation energy , approximately speaking , the free energy required to insert a defect in a lattice is reduced by the energy liberated due to ionization of the donor and acceptor . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the formation of the defect complexes in favor over the single defects is often observed during material deposition @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present our study of the formation mechanism of @xmath7 pair in pbo layers and its effect on the electronic properties .    </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the formation of @xmath7 vacancy pair was performed using the density functional theory ( dft ) available in the wien2k package @xcite which utilizes the full - potential augmented plane - wave method . </S>",
    "<S> the perdew - burke - ernzerhof parameterization @xcite of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to dft has been implemented . </S>",
    "<S> we assigned only @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons of the pb atom and @xmath12 and @xmath13 electrons of the o atom to the valence states , while the lower energy electrons were included into the core shells . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell approach was applied in which the supercell was taken of 120 atom size ( 5@xmath143@xmath142 array of the primitive cells shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> for some calculations , the supercell of 108 atom size has been used ( 3@xmath143@xmath143 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell has been optimized with respect to the internal degrees of freedom , for which minimization based on the forces has been applied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the following parameters have been used : @xmath15=7 ( product of the atomic sphere radius and the plane - wave cut - off in k - space ) , and standard monkhorst - pack mesh of size 4@xmath144@xmath142 in k - space for brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that pbo layers are composed primarily of @xmath0-pbo single crystals @xcite , we have considered it as a model compound . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-pbo single crystal is of the tetragonal symmetry ( 129p4/nmm ) , its crystal structure is layered and the layers are held together due to interlayer orbital overlap of the pb:@xmath16 lone pairs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed information on structure and parameters used in our investigation of the vacancy defects can be found elsewhere @xcite .    upon formation of the vacancy pair , </S>",
    "<S> deficiency of two electrons at the pb vacancy is compensated by two electrons occupying the o vacancy and dangling bonds are closed on each other . </S>",
    "<S> since pb vacancy state is delocalized beyond the vacancy site ( its wavefunction is spread over at least five nearest - neighbours ) , it is not required for o and pb vacancies to be located at the nearest sites to form a pair : schematic presentation of a position of the interacting vacancies relative to each other is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic interactions between vacancies are calculated as function of separation distance . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis has revealed that an extra electron or hole added to the pair is delocalized implying that @xmath7 has only zero charge state for which the formation energy is @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total energy of the system containing the defect and defect - free , respectively ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are the chemical potentials of removed atoms ( o and pb atoms ) where @xmath22 is the energy required to move atom from vacuum to the conditions of growth ( @xmath23 - 2.92 ev @xcite is defined for the stable compound ) .     </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) the crystal structure of @xmath0-pbo is shown for supercell of size 5@xmath143@xmath142 . </S>",

    "<S> have been placed into the same supercell , but in different layers . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between such vacancies are absent and each vacancy creates its own localized state , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energy under typical growth conditions ( @xmath28 - 2.92 ev ) is found to be @xmath29=5.41 ev . to initiate the interaction between vacancies , </S>",
    "<S> they have been placed in the same supercell and the same layer . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energies of the vacancy pair @xmath30 as function of the vacancy separation are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ( in the following we assume that @xmath30 is saturated at position 4 ) .     </S>",
    "<S> the formation energy of the vacancy pair as a function of the vacancy separation ( @xmath24 position is referred to positions 1,2,3 and 4 in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) ) : ( a ) formation of the @xmath7 vacancy pair . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) binding of @xmath24 to previously formed @xmath25 ( @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) binding of @xmath25 to already existing @xmath24 ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energy of the single charged vacancies are calculated elsewhere @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the total lowering in the formation energy upon vacancy binding is found to be @xmath33=-1.47 ev ( vacancies are located next to each other ) which suggests that @xmath7 is extremely energetically favored . </S>",
    "<S> there are two primary parts contributing to @xmath33 : interaction energy @xmath34 and lattice relaxation @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 is the energy change induced by the electron exchange between @xmath26 and @xmath27 causing their ionization to @xmath3 and @xmath4 states which is followed by lattice relaxation @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath34 can be determined through the difference between the considered position and the point of saturation ( position 4 is considered here to be the saturation point ) , is equal to 0.55 ev for @xmath24 in position 1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 gradually decreases as oxygen vacancy is moved away ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) thus increasing the formation energy of a pair . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath34=0.55 ev is foreseen to be underestimated because the state formed by the @xmath25 vacancy is largely delocalized and when @xmath24 is placed at position 4 , it already may interact with the periodic copies of @xmath25 . to eliminate this effect </S>",
    "<S> , the supercell of larger size has to be implemented which is not computationally affordable for us . </S>",
    "<S> for all positions depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) , @xmath35 is constant and equals to 0.92 ev as the charge state within @xmath25 is not changed .    </S>",
    "<S> although vacancy binding lowers the formation energy , its value is still high ( @xmath36 4 ev ) because the pb and o vacancies are considered to appear simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the more realistic case appears to be settling as the compensating vacancy originates near already existing vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce notation @xmath32 when @xmath25 is formed nearby existing @xmath24 , and @xmath31 for the opposite case . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energies are : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the total energy of the system containing the single vacancy @xmath25 or @xmath24 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the results on the formation energy of the vacancy pairs , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the different growth conditions have been considered : @xmath41=0.0 ev and @xmath42=-2.92 ev are defined for pb - rich / o - poor limit , while @xmath41=-2.92 ev and @xmath42=0.0 ev for pb - poor / o - rich limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a very important trend to be observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) : the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are significantly lower than the formation energy of the corresponding single vacancies in their doubly ionized state @xcite . taking into account that binding energy is only @xmath33 = -1.47 ev , this trend indicates that the lattice distortion induced by the single vacancy reduces the energy required to generate another vacancy nearby . </S>",
    "<S> the single vacancy disturbs the lattice periodicity that alters the atomic forces between atoms and weakens the covalent bonds around the vacancy site .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the pb vacancy sets up a lattice to accommodate the o vacancy , thus causing a reduction in the formation energy @xmath45=4.52 ev ( @xmath24 is in position 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> negative @xmath44 means that the lattice containing @xmath25 tends to `` suck in '' o vacancy and formation of @xmath31 pair becomes spontaneous . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the pb vacancies to be completely passivated by o vacancies , as even for o - rich limit the formation energy @xmath44 is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the formation of pb vacancy in close proximity to pre - existing o vacancy is energetically more favorable than single double ionized @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gain in energy is smaller than in the previous case : @xmath46=1.96 ev and because @xmath47 0 , the lattice distortion induced by o vacancy is not sufficient to make a process of origin of the pb vacancy spontaneous .    to understand an effect of passivation on the transport properties , the next step is to examine alteration in the electronic properties induced by the neutral vacancy pair . </S>",
    "<S> we found , since the uncompensated dangling bonds are absent at the @xmath7 defect site , the vacancy pair has a little effect on the band formation as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the vacancy pair does not seems to generate any localized state within the band gap , but rather induces a slight modification into the band behavior . the top valence band and its dispersion are almost unaffected by the appearance of the vacancy pair and , therefore the hole microscopic mobility is predicted to remain the same ( it is already low as a result of heavy holes @xmath48=2.44 @xmath49 @xcite ) . in the conduction band , the vacancy pair induces a shift of the lowest band down on the energy axis . </S>",
    "<S> this band is a product of closing of the dangling bonds of vacancies on each other , i.e. its antibonding orbital . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it shows a slightly weaker dispersion at the @xmath50 point that is anticipated to cause a reduction in the electron mobility .     </S>",
    "<S> band diagram for ideal supercell ( black solid line ) and for the same supercell containing the @xmath7 defect ( red dashed line ) . ]    to gain insight the band behaviour we have plotted the electron density map for bottom of the conduction band ( @xmath51 ) and top of the valence band ( @xmath52 ) in fig .  [ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the o vacancy was created next to the pb vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density map is plotted for the narrow energy range ( @xmath51 + 0.076 ev ) and ( @xmath52 - 0.076 ev ) to catch @xmath51 and @xmath52 in vicinity of the @xmath50 and @xmath53 points , respectively . for the conduction band , </S>",
    "<S> the electron density shows the pronounced localization in the layer containing @xmath7 and , in particular , on the atoms around the defect site : continuity of the electron network is disturbed that should affect the electron microscopic mobility . for the valence band , an alteration in the electron density </S>",
    "<S> is confined entirely to the vacancy site where density vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> although such hole in the electron density can affect the carrier transport locally in the vicinity of the defect , beyond that density remains undisturbed , suggesting that the hole mobility is not altered .     </S>",
    "<S> colour on - line . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density map ( e / a@xmath54 ) plotted with xcrysden @xcite for 3@xmath143@xmath143 supercell : the cutting plane is perpendicular to layers and passes through the vacancy site . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the conduction band ( @xmath51 + 0.076 ev ) , ( b ) the valence band ( @xmath52 - 0.076 ev ) . ]    from our study , one can conclude that pb vacancies in pbo layers are passivated by o vacancies to form the neutral vacancy pair . </S>",
    "<S> it seems reasonable to assume that negative effect of the vacancy pairs on the transport properties of pbo photoconductive layers would be minimized as the @xmath7 pair can not act as trapping center ( dangling bonds are absent and extra electron or hole is delocalized ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as pair formation involves merging of single pb and o vacancies ( @xmath33 = -1.47 </S>",
    "<S> ev ) which otherwise are active traps , it is foreseen to suppress the carrier trapping . </S>",
    "<S> as the concentration of o vacancies is higher than that of pb vacancies , the large fraction of @xmath26 is left uncompensated to be filled with two electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental evidence of @xmath55-type conductivity in pbo layers @xcite supports this observation . </S>",
    "<S> our finding offer a practical way to improve the transport properties of thermally deposited pbo layers . </S>",
    "<S> the post - growth annealing ( in vacuum or oxygen atmosphere ) would initiate migration of the o vacancies towards pb vacancies with driving forces defined by the vacancy interaction @xmath34=0.55 ev and facilitates their merging . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to reduce an amount of ionized centres in pbo thus improving drift mobilities of electrons and holes as well suppressing recombination . </S>"
