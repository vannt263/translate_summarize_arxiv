    "modifications of hadrons in dense nuclear matter are currently in the center of theoretical studies @xcite . in particular",
    ", the multiple pion production in heavy - ion collisions offers an interesting possibility to look at the properties of the baryon resonances in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it is well established ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) that at beam energies of @xmath0 a gev pions are produced mostly in the two - step process @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for the @xmath4 or higher baryon resonances .",
    "however , there is an overall tendency of transport models explicitly propagating resonances to overpredict the pion multiplicity in heavy - ion collisions at the beam energy @xmath5 a gev ( c.f .",
    "furthermore , taking into account in - medium pion dispersion relations even increases the pion yield @xcite .    in the present work we study the effect of possible in - medium modifications of the reaction rates @xmath6 on pion production .",
    "a description of the experimental data on the pion multiplicities requires an _ in - medium reduction _ of the rates ( [ nnnr ] ) .",
    "we propose , therefore , a density - dependent modification of the transition rates ( [ nnnr ] ) , which gives a reasonable description of the pion multiplicities in the systems c+c , ni+ni and au+au at the beam energy of 1@xmath72 a gev .",
    "we will show , moreover , that this modification is consistent with other pion observables , i.e. transverse mass and kinetic energy spectra , angular distributions and in - plane collective flow .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we discuss the effect of the resonance production / absorption quenching on the pion production . sect .",
    "iii contains the results on the collective pion flows , while in sect .",
    "iv the summary and conclusions are given .",
    "in our numerical calculations we have used the buu model in the version described in ref .",
    "the nucleons , @xmath4 and higher ( up to @xmath9 ) baryon resonances , @xmath10 and @xmath11 hyperons , mesons @xmath12 are explicitly propagated in this buu implementation .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to the calculation of nucleon collective flow observables in heavy - ion collisions at energies from @xmath13 amev up to @xmath14 a gev @xcite .",
    "a good description of `` more elementary '' @xmath15 and @xmath16 induced reactions has been also reached within the model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on pion production in nucleus - nucleus collisions continuing the studies initiated in refs .",
    "all calculations in the present paper are performed using the soft momentum - dependent mean field ( sm ) with incompressibility @xmath17 mev , which gives the best overall description of the nucleon collective flow variables @xcite .",
    "the buu set of parameters , which includes the sm mean field as well as vacuum resonance parameters and vacuum elastic and inelastic cross sections , will be denoted as `` standard '' below .",
    "the modifications of the standard set will be discussed in the text explicitly .",
    "first , we compare the calculated pion multiplicities in central au+au collisions at 1 a gev with the experimental data . in fig .",
    "1 the dashed line shows the pion number vs time in the case of the standard calculation . the pion multiplicity asymptotically reaches a value of @xmath18 which is almost a factor of 2 larger than the experimental value of @xmath19 ( c.f . ref .",
    "pions are produced dominantly by the baryon resonance decays .",
    "therefore , the pion multiplicity is very sensitive to the number of resonances present in the system",
    ". the differential production cross section of a resonance @xmath3 with mass @xmath20 in a nucleon - nucleon collision , averaged over the spins of initial particles and summed over the spins of final particles , is given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a spin - averaged matrix element squared , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are c.m .",
    "momenta of incoming and outgoing particles , @xmath25 is the total c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath26 is the spectral function of the resonance , and @xmath27 is the spin of the resonance .",
    "the inverse reaction cross section is @xmath28 where , due to detailed balance , the same matrix element appears as in eq .",
    "( [ signnnr ] ) , @xmath29 if the nucleons @xmath30 and @xmath31 are identical and @xmath32 otherwise .",
    "the matrix element which appears in eqs .",
    "( [ signnnr]),([signrnn ] ) should be evaluated in nuclear matter . instead of using any model dependent parametrizations for the in - medium matrix element",
    ", we adopt a simple relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the vacuum matrix element squared and @xmath35 is some density - dependent function to be determined by comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the in - medium matrix elements for the non - resonant ( background ) one - pion production / absorption @xmath36 , double @xmath37(1232 ) production / absorption @xmath38 and resonance scattering on nucleons @xmath39 are also related to their vacuum values by eq .",
    "( [ muinmed ] ) with the same universal function @xmath35 .",
    "we address now the pion multiplicity in central au+au collisions at 1.06 a gev using various choices of the function @xmath35 . as a first trial",
    ", we simulate an enhancement of resonance production in nn collisions @xcite assuming a linear dependence on density as in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 is the equilibrium nuclear matter density .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "1 ( dotted line ) , that the amplified matrix element with @xmath43 leads to an about 20% reduction in the final pion multiplicity which , however , is still above the experimental abundance .",
    "this decrease originates from the amplified  by detailed balance ",
    "absorption of resonances in the expansion stage of the system .",
    "a further increase of the parameter @xmath44 practically does not reduce the pion number any further ( see fig . 3 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "an essential reduction of the pion multiplicity can only be reached by a _ quenching _ of the resonance production / absorption processes in nuclear matter at high density . to this aim",
    "we apply a piece - wise linear function of the form @xmath46 which is shown by the solid line in fig . 2 for the particular case @xmath47 . within the parametrization ( [ kappafit ] ) ,",
    "the in - medium effects vanish at subnuclear densities ( @xmath48 ) , but above @xmath49 the nuclear medium creates the shadowing of binary collisions involving resonances leading , effectively , to a quenching of these collisions for @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "3 ( see the part of the buu curve for @xmath51 ) we report the number of produced negative pions vs @xmath44 in the case of the parametrization ( [ kappafit ] ) .",
    "the proper pion multiplicity is reproduced for @xmath47 ; we will denote this calculation as `` quenched '' in the following . for this calculation",
    ", resonances do not experience any elastic or inelastic scatterings in high density nuclear matter .",
    "they can , however , decay or be produced in the processes @xmath52 . in the quenching scenario , the resonance production in nn collisions happens only at relatively low density @xmath53 , i.e. dominantly in the overlapping tails of the density profiles of colliding nuclei .",
    "this reduces the maximum number of @xmath37-resonances to about @xmath54 as compared to a standard calculation ( c.f . solid and dashed lines in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 ) .    before discussing other pion - related observables",
    "we check , how the resonance quenching influences the underlying nucleon dynamics .",
    "4 shows the proton rapidity distribution and the transverse momentum of protons in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity . due to a lower nucleon inelasticity within the quenching scenario ,",
    "the nuclei show less stopping , i.e. the rapidity distribution becomes somewhat wider and , since also the pressure is decreased , a slightly smaller transverse in - plane flow is generated making the agreement of the standard sm calculation @xcite with the proton flow data worse ( see also fig .",
    "this problem , however , can be resolved by either increasing the incompressibility or the stiffness of the momentum - dependent interaction .",
    "the latter modifications influence only weakly the pion multiplicity and , therefore , are not studied in this work .    in fig .",
    "5 we present the pion multiplicity as a function of the participant number @xmath55 for au+au collisions at 1.06 a gev in comparison with the fopi and taps data collected in ref .",
    "we have determined the participant number for a given impact parameter using the participant - spectator model with sharp nuclear density profiles .",
    "the quenched calculation is in a good agreement with the data for central collisions ; in peripheral collisions the medium effects are smaller , the difference between the standard and the quenched calculation vanishes gradually and , thus , the multiplicity is still somewhat overpredicted .",
    "this discrepancy in peripheral collisions could arise from different definitions of the participant number @xmath55 in our calculations and in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the impact parameter can not be measured directly in the experiment .",
    "6 shows the beam energy dependence of the charged pion multiplicity for central ni+ni collisions compared with the fopi data from ref .",
    "the quenched calculation describes the data rather well . with increasing beam energy",
    "the difference between standard and quenched calculations reduces , since the nonresonant string mechanism for pion production becomes dominant , which is the same in both calculations .",
    "we recall that in our transport approach strings are excited in nn collisions for invariant collision energies @xmath56 gev corresponding to the beam energy of @xmath57 a gev if the fermi motion is neglected .",
    "7 shows the c.m .",
    "kinetic energy spectra of charged pions at @xmath58 for au+au at 1.06 a gev .",
    "the quenching improves the agreement with the data somewhat producing a more concave shape of the spectrum for @xmath59 gev .",
    "however , the calculated cross sections in this region are still too large , while at low kinetic energy the experimental data are underpredicted by the quenched calculation .",
    "a similar tendency is visible in the case of @xmath60-spectra at midrapidity shown in fig . 8 : the improvement by the quenching mechanism at high @xmath60 is evident , but at low @xmath60 too few pions are produced .",
    "this leads also to the underprediction of the midrapidity pion yield by the quenched calculation .",
    "therefore , since the total pion multiplicity agrees with the data ( or slightly overpredicts for peripheral collisions , see fig .",
    "5 ) , the quenched calculation will produce some excess of pions at projectile / target rapidities .",
    "we will , however , discard here the comparison of our results with the fopi data on the pion rapidity distribution from ref .",
    "this comparison would require the treatment of our buu - events in exactly the same way as the data , which is out of scope of this work .",
    "the reason for the underprediction of the low-@xmath60 pion yields by the quenched calculation is , probably , an overdamping of the low mass resonance production in nn collisions at high density by the quenching factor ( [ kappafit ] ) .",
    "indeed , a smaller medium effect is expected for higher kinetic energies of the final particles in analogy to pauli blocking @xcite . in this exploratory work we are not aiming at a detailed description of the pion energy spectra , but , rather , want to demonstrate the gross effect of the density modified matrix element on various pion observables .",
    "it is straightforward , however , to introduce a @xmath61 and resonance - mass - dependent modification factor @xmath62 in eq.([muinmed ] ) .",
    "another physical effect is the off - shellness of the pion in the nuclear medium due to large @xmath63 cross section , which leads to a broad pion spectral function .",
    "thus a dynamical evolution of the hadron spectral functions in buu will modify the low momentum spectra sensitively @xcite .    in fig .",
    "9 we present the c.m .",
    "polar angle distributions of charged pions .",
    "the shape of these spectra is similar to the one for free - space pion production in nn collisions .",
    "there is a good overall agreement of the quenched calculation with the data .    for the collisions c+c at 0.8@xmath72 a gev ( fig .",
    "10 ) the calculated @xmath64-spectra of @xmath65 s are practically identical in the standard and quenched calculations .",
    "this is expected , since the in - medium modifications are smaller in the lighter system .",
    "in earlier studies ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , the pion antiflow and squeeze - out have been explained by the rescattering of pions on the spectator nucleons , which leads to the shadowing phenomenon .",
    "11 shows the proton , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in - plane flow ( @xmath68 at @xmath69 ) for the au+au system at 1.15 a gev as a function of impact parameter in comparison to the data @xcite . the best overall agreement with the data",
    "is reached within the standard sm calculation . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the quenched and standard results are almost indistinguishable within statistics .",
    "however , the proton flow is underpredicted by the quenched calculation ( see discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "the difference in flows for @xmath66 and @xmath67 is due to the coulomb interaction with protons which increases ( decreases ) the antiflow for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for large impact parameter .    in fig .",
    "12 we show the squeeze - out ratio @xmath71 as a function of the transverse momentum for positive pions at midrapidity in comparison to the data @xcite .",
    "the squeeze - out ratio grows with @xmath60 since faster moving pions in transverse direction reach the spectators earlier and rescatter in analogy to the case of the nucleon squeeze - out @xcite .",
    "a peculiar feature of the @xmath72-dependence for positive pions is its saturation at relatively low @xmath73 gev / c , while the nucleon squeeze - out ratios increase monotonically with @xmath60 ( c.f .",
    "this behaviour of the pion squeeze - out ratio is related to the resonance nature of @xmath74 scattering @xcite .",
    "our calculations , both standard and quenched , underpredict the absolute value of @xmath75 , but the shape of the function @xmath72 is in a qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy lies , most probably , in the absence of any momentum dependence in the pion potential .",
    "within the transport buu model @xcite we have studied the influence of the in - medium modifications of the reaction rates ( [ nnnr ] ) on pion production in heavy - ion collisions around 1 a gev .",
    "the pion multiplicity in the system au+au at 1 a gev can be consistently described assuming a quenching of the resonance production / absorption in nn collisions at high nuclear densities .",
    "the quenching generally improves the description of standard buu calculations with experiment on other pion observables : @xmath60- , @xmath64- and kinetic energy spectra , in - plane and out - of - plane collective flows .",
    "the physical reason for the in - medium reduction of the resonance production rates , that seems to be needed to describe the pion data , remains open .",
    "this is in particular so because there are theoretical predictions that the @xmath37 excitation cross section should increase with density @xcite .",
    "a collisional broadening of the @xmath37-resonance , that was not taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite , could , in principle , provide the obviously needed reduction , but the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , that were based on reasonable collision rates , have shown that this broadening is too small .",
    "all these models have in common that they work with free coupling constants and thus neglect any in - medium vertex corrections . good calculations of inelastic nucleon - nucleon scattering in nuclear matter would be needed to clarify this problem .    99    c.m .",
