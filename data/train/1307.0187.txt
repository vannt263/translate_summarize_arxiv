    "in wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) , the fundamental task is to broadcast data from the origin sensor to the destination .",
    "however , due to the limited size , power and cost of these sensors , a low power signal is often transmitted to the destination  @xcite . this low power signal is further attenuated due to the propagation loss . to combat this problem ,",
    "the signal is sometimes measured by as many sensors as possible  @xcite . these sensors",
    "form a distributed cooperative sensor network , enabling them to achieve spatial diversity which will help combat fading effects and extend network coverage  @xcite .",
    "low - complexity cooperative diversity protocols have been developed and analyzed for cooperative communications in different operating conditions and environments . according to  @xcite ,",
    "the family of fixed relaying arrangements have the lowest complexity as compared to all the other families . the family of fixed relaying consists of decode - and - forward ( df ) and amplify - and - forward ( af ) protocols .",
    "it has been proved that the af protocol has the ability to achieve similar bit error rate ( ber ) performance as compared to that of the df protocol , while maintaining a lower complexity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only the af protocol is considered in our contribution .",
    "the design of low - complexity detectors at the destination plays a significant role in wsns , as the sensor nodes are powered by batteries  @xcite . the maximum likelihood ( ml ) detector is the optimal detector in terms of ber for equally likely symbols  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the high computational complexity of the ml detector , suboptimal linear detectors are often considered for wsns  @xcite . in suboptimal linear detectors ,",
    "minimum mean square error ( mmse ) detection is preferred due to its improved ber performance  @xcite .",
    "it can be observed that , as the number of sensors increases , the complexity of the mmse detector becomes extremely high  @xcite .",
    "recently , in order to solve this problem , channel shortening ( cs)-based technique has been proposed for cooperative networks  @xcite .",
    "a preprocessing matrix in cs - based technique is designed where only @xmath1 sensors are chosen out of @xmath0 sensors .",
    "the idea is to maximize the energy reception of the selected @xmath1 sensors while minimizing the energy leakage of the remaining sensors and the ambient noise power .",
    "as only @xmath1 sensors are selected and processed at the destination , the computational complexity will be lower than the ideal mmse detector .",
    "in cooperative communications , the best relay is selected and then the transmit power of that relay is maximized  @xcite .",
    "there are two major problems when applying this approach to wsns .",
    "firstly , no power adaptation is applied .",
    "secondly , the sensors are powered by batteries , therefore , it is not rational to transmit the signal with more power . in such scenarios ,",
    "cs - based techniques can be adopted and they outperform the technique of best relay selection in terms of ber as shown in  @xcite . by employing cs - based techniques , the destination captures @xmath1 strongest signals out of the @xmath0 received ones . as the receiver tries to maximize the energy of @xmath1 sensors , the energy in @xmath3 sensors is lost .",
    "therefore , a loss in the ber is observed when comparing the cs - based techniques with the approach involving all participating sensors .    in order to solve this problem ,",
    "a design of the preprocessing matrix with the assistance of reduced - rank techniques is proposed in this paper .",
    "reduced - rank techniques have been widely applied to array processing  @xcite , radar signal processing , direct - sequence code divison multiple access ( ds - cdma )  @xcite , space - time coded space - division  @xcite and ultra - wide band ( uwb ) systems  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in this contribution three types of rank reduction techniques are considered , which derive their detection subspaces based on the concepts of principal component ( pc )  @xcite , cross - spectral metric ( csm )  @xcite and taylor polynomial approximation ( tpa )  @xcite .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows : ( i ) arrangement of the sensors according to signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ordering , as an improvement over cs - based techniques ; ( ii ) application of reduced - rank techniques for providing the compromise between computational complexity and performance ; and ( iii ) development of a diversity - order analysis for reduced - rank techniques .",

    "if the selection is more than @xmath145 sensors , it is better to deploy ideal mmse detection as compared to the ocs - based detector . thirdly , the complexity saving of pc - based preprocessing matrix becomes larger than that of csm - based preprocessing matrix , although this advantage in complexity saving results in more difference in snr as compared to ideal mmse detector .",
    "finally , it can be concluded that designing tpa - based preprocessing matrix gives us more computational saving as well as less difference in snr as compared to all the other considered techniques .",
    "in this paper , channel - shortening ( cs ) and rank - reduction techniques have been proposed for cooperative wsns to reduce the complexity of the ideal mmse detector while maintaining the ber performance .",
    "the proposed cs technique outperforms the previously known cs techniques by more than @xmath144db when @xmath143 .",
    "the performance and complexity of the proposed reduced - rank techniques are superior to the cs technique when deploying fixed - gain amplification factor .",
    "however , a tradeoff can be observed between the complexity and ber performance when the sensors utilize variable - gain amplification factor . the cross spectral metric ( csm)-based technique outperforms the principal component ( pc)-based technique in terms of ber , but with a modest increase in complexity . while , the taylor polynomial approximation ( tpa)-based technique reaches the same ber performance as the ideal mmse for @xmath146 .",
    "our future research will concentrate on implementing adaptive rank - reduction schemes when the channel knowledge is not available .      in this appendix",
    ", we carry out a case study for the diversity order of pca- and csm - based rank reduction using @xmath142 .",
    "the correlation matrix can be given as @xmath150 and we can asymptotically approximate @xmath151 as the snr goes to infinity ( i.e. , @xmath152 ) , where @xmath153 denotes asymptotic value in high snr . then , the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue is approximately @xmath154 which is the preprocessing matrix @xmath55 when @xmath142 in pca - based reduced rank technique ( it is also a preprocessing vector in tpa - based technique with @xmath142 . ) .",
    "multiplying this preprocessing vector by the received signal , the output signal can be given as @xmath155 and the received snr can be computed as @xmath156 the diversity order of the received snr can be defined as  @xcite @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes the snr and @xmath159 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath160 . without loss of generality , we set @xmath161 by assuming @xmath162 and @xmath163 for all @xmath164",
    ". then , let us look at the diversity order for fixed- and variable - gain amplifications . throughout this appendix ,",
    "the diversity gain is calculated with the help of the cdf of the received snr which is equivalent to the outage probability of the received snr .",
    "applying fixed - gain amplification factor in high snr , i.e. , @xmath165 , and substituting it and @xmath166 into ( [ eq-41 ] ) yields @xmath167 it is also intractable to compute the exact cdf of @xmath168 and we first find the tractable lower bound of @xmath168 .",
    "the lower bound on the diversity order in terms of snr will emphasize that the system will have at least the diversity order of lower bound of @xmath168 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath168 is bounded by @xmath169 which is represented as @xmath170 defining two random variables , @xmath171 and @xmath172 , we can easily observe that the random variable @xmath173 is irrelevant of @xmath158 and @xmath174 is the central chi - square random variable with @xmath175 degrees of freedom with probability density function ( pdf )  @xcite @xmath176 by substituting the taylor expansion of @xmath177 into the above pdf , the cdf can be represented as @xmath178 the cdf of @xmath169 can be represented as @xmath179\\nonumber\\\\ \\!&\\ ! = \\ ! & \\ !",

    "hence , full diversity is achieved when employing fixed gain amplification even with @xmath142 .      applying variable - gain amplification factor in high snr ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath183 , and substituting it and @xmath184 into ( [ eq-41 ] ) yields @xmath185 due to the intractability of the exact cdf of @xmath186 , we should find the upper - bound of @xmath186 which does not affect the diversity order of @xmath186 . by omitting some parts of denominator",
    ", @xmath186 is upper - bounded such that @xmath187 using the inequality , for any @xmath188 , @xmath186 is further bounded as @xmath189 defining @xmath190 and @xmath191 temporarily , we can say that @xmath192 is irrelevant of the snr @xmath158 and @xmath193 is exponentially distributed with @xmath194 .",
    "the cdf of @xmath195 can be represented as @xmath196\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\mathrm{pr}\\big[x_\\ell y_\\ell",

    "\\mathrm{pr}[x_\\ell y_\\ell < x],\\label{cdflb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality holds because both probabilities in summation are equally probable over @xmath164 .",
    "this conditional cdf is cumbersome to calculate because of the correlation between random variables in order over @xmath197 . by omitting the condition",
    ", the third inequality holds . by using the taylor expansion of the cdf of @xmath193 , @xmath198 , the probability in ( [ cdflb ] )",
