    "several solid state physical implementations of quantum computing have been proposed both from experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite points of view . in solid state physics",
    "many approaches have been used ranging from quantum dots , to donor - atom nuclear spins or electron spins . a characteristic common to all the scenarios is a tunable heisenberg exchange interaction between spins to generate two - qubit quantum gate operations .    in the last decade",
    "electron spins confined in quantum dots have become an attractive basis for quantum computing because of their relatively long coherence times and potential for scaling @xcite . in the simplest proposal ,",
    "single spins form the logical basis , with single qubit operations via spin resonance @xcite .",
    "an alternative scheme , with logical basis realized with singlet and triplet states of two spins requires inhomogeneous static magnetic field for full single - qubit control @xcite . using three spins to represent each qubit removes the need for an inhomogeneous field @xcite .",
    "exchange interactions between adjacent spins suffice for all one- and two - qubit operations @xcite . here",
    "we study a pair of double dot exchange only qubits in which three electrons are distributed in a double quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the logical states are defined adopting linear combination of singlet - triplet states of a pair of electrons in one dot with single electron states of the electron in the other dot .",
    "the schrieffer - wolff method has already been applied to a single qubit @xcite .",
    "we employ the method to treat the two qubits case in order to express the hamiltonian in terms of effective heisenberg exchange and to exploit it to generate cnot gates .",
    "the effective hamiltonian explicitly express the dynamical behavior of the system and determines the conditions to realize gate operations .",
    "the most efficient sequences of interactions realizing cnot gates have been consequently calculated in two different geometrical configurations . a numerical calculation based on a simplex method mixed with",
    "a genetic algorithm has been used .",
    "device designs featuring different geometrical sizes are compared by exploiting a spin density function theory ( sdft)-based simulator , presenting design rules for fast cnot gates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the derivation of the effective hamiltonians for the pair of interacting qubits in the two configurations under study .",
    "section 3 contains the main results on the sequences that realize cnot gates in the case in which all the interactions are controllable from the external and in the realistic situation in which the intra - dot interactions are fixed by the geometry of the system . finally in section 4 an analysis on the gate performance in a silicon nanowire double quantum dot is presented",
    "in this section we derive the schrieffer - wolff effective hamiltonian to describe in a simple and intuitive way a couple of interacting qubits by combining a hubbard - like model with a projector operator method . as a result ,",
    "the hubbard - like hamiltonian is transformed into an equivalent expression in terms of the exchange coupling interactions between pairs of electrons .",
    "the method has been recently applied to derive the effective hamiltonian of the single qubit in ref.@xcite .",
    "the turning point in this case is represented by the way in which the two qubits are put into connection .",
    "since the two dots composing the qubit are asymmetric , it follows that there are different possible configurations . for the purpose of our analysis",
    "we consider the two configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        generally speaking the hamiltonian model",
    "is always expressed as the sum of three contributions : @xmath0 the first two terms , common to all the cases under study , are the free hamiltonians of the two qubits hereafter called @xmath1 and @xmath2 , written in terms of the creation and annihilation fermionic operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively @xmath5 where @xmath6 and with @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 for every pair of spins considered .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 describe respectively the single electron energy level of each dot and the tunneling energy .",
    "the last two terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 constitute the intra - dot and inter - dot coulomb interactions .",
    "more in details , the parameters appearing in eq.([hj ] ) are : the spin exchange @xmath14 , the pair - hopping @xmath15 and the occupation - modulated hopping terms @xmath16 .",
    "the last term appearing in eq.([h ] ) is the interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 , whose explicit form depends case by case by the interaction mechanism , but always expressed as : @xmath18    in the next subsections we are going to present the final form of the effective hamiltonians in the two cases depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the configuration a in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to the situation in which the right dot of the first qubit is put into direct connection with the left dot of the second qubit in such a way that the principal mechanism of interaction is between one orbital of one dot with two orbitals of the other .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian ( [ int ] ) is given by the sum of the following terms @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined as in eq.([hj ] ) .",
    "following the same procedure reported in ref.@xcite , we calculate the projected hamiltonian .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , concerning the low energy excitation , appears as the sum af all the exchange interactions between pairs of spins @xmath21 the effective coupling constants , considering that intra - dot coulomb energies are larger than all the other contributions are explicitly given in appendix a.      the second configuration b under study , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , corresponds to the situation in which the direct interaction is between the dots that present two orbitals .",
    "this structure create a greater number of interconnections between qubits than in configuration a. we assume that energy detuning between the double occupied quantum dots is small enough with respect to energy difference between levels @xmath22 and @xmath23 in each quantum dot . as a result ,",
    "terms of the hamiltonian containing tunnelling rates and exchange interactions between energy levels in different quantum dots with different indexes ( i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) are negligible .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian terms are finally given by @xmath26 where @xmath20 is defined as in eq.([hj ] ) .",
    "analogously to the previous case , the effective hamiltonian appears as the sum of exchange interactions : @xmath27 the effective coupling constants , under the assumption of larger intra - dot energies with respect to inter - dot ones are explicitly given in appendix a.",
    "this section presents the gate sequences which realize cnot operations in both configurations a and b. the effective hamiltonians , in which only exchange interactions between pairs of spin with effective coupling constants appear , allow to represent the unitary evolution between the i - th and j - th spins with the operator @xmath28 after having introduced the mathematical background in appendix b , we examine the simplified toy model in which all the interactions between spins are assumed controllable from the external in appendix c. in particular we follow the procedure delineated in ref.@xcite composed by two steps : in the first one we use the central sequence found in ref.@xcite that give a gate operation that is locally equivalent to a cnot operation ; in the second step , single qubit operations , to be applied before and after the central sequence in order to obtain an exact cnot gate , are found .    in this section",
    "we solve the realistic problem in which only inter - dot interactions are tunable from the external , while the intra - dot ones are fixed by the geometry of the system . to this end",
    "we adopt a search algorithm with a variable number of steps , showing how it is possible to obtain directly the exact cnot for the configurations a and b.      let s now concentrate on the realistic physical situation in which the unavoidable intra - dot interactions are fixed and not tunable from the external .",
    "in fact @xmath29 does not depend on the tunnelling rates ( see eqs .",
    "[ couplinga ] and [ couplingb ] ) whose values can span several order of magnitudes and strongly control @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we assumed max(@xmath30 ) = max(@xmath31 ) = @xmath32 and we set a realistic constant value for @xmath29 = @xmath32/2 to model the control ineffectiveness .",
    "moreover , the exchange interactions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assumed to have instantaneous turn - on and turn - off . in these hypothesis we derive for both configurations the sequences of unitary operations generated by exchange interactions as in eq.([u ] ) , whose product gives the cnot operation in the total angular momentum basis .      the interaction sequence for an exact cnot operation for the configuration a is calculated by using the search algorithm in the case of fixed intra - dot interaction with a final objective function value of 0.001 ( see eq .",
    "[ func ] ) .",
    "the resulting sequence is reported in tab.[tab : seqandtimescnotv1 ] @xcite .",
    "after the cnot sequence , the resulting transformation matrix which couples initial and final quantum states in the @xmath35 subspace is shown in fig.[v1 ] .",
    "the @xmath36 block in the up - left corner corresponds to the graphical representation of the cnot matrix reported in eq.([eq : cnot ] ) .",
    "same correspondence is obtained for the @xmath36 block in the @xmath37 subspace ( not shown ) .",
