    "two photon interactions are instrumental to extract the hadronic structure function of the photon , which is related to the quark densities in the photon . it is measured in single tagged events , which means that one of the photons is real , and the other has a large momentum transfer much larger than @xmath2 . this process can be viewed as deep inelastic electron e-@xmath3 scattering , where a quasi real photon is probed by a virtual photon with high q@xmath4 . the differential cross section @xmath5 is related to the hadronic structure function : @xmath6\\frac{2\\pi\\alpha^2}{xq^2}$ ] with @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the longitudinal term can usually be neglected since y@xmath4 is small .",
    "the lep2 data has considerably extended the reach towards small x. the present level of precision starts to challenge current structure function parameterizations .",
    "the newest result comes from aleph in the q@xmath4 range of 17.3 and 67.2 gev@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "heavy quark production , provides important tests of perturbative qcd as well as probing the partonic densities in the photon .",
    "recent results include a d * measurement of aleph  @xcite and a muon semileptonic measurement by delphi  @xcite .",
    "aleph shows that besides w , also the transverse momentum and the differential cross section in p@xmath9 and @xmath10 are in good agreement with nlo qcd .",
    "delphi added a preliminary third measured point of the total bottom cross section , which agrees well with results from opal and l3 .",
    "the large quark mass should allow good accuracy in perturbative calculations .",
    "however the current status of nlo qcd underestimates the cross sections by about a factor of 3 .",
    "this discrepancy can not be tuned away by changing the b - quark mass .",
    "l3 has complemented their earlier result in inclusive @xmath11 production with an inclusive charged pion and kaon production measurement  @xcite , using the lep2 data in the region of @xmath125 gev and q@xmath138gev@xmath4 , see figure  [ fig : ppbar]a ) .",
    "there is a good agreement between data and nlo qcd below a p@xmath9 of 3 gev , but above about 5 gev the data clearly surpass the expectation similar to the excess previously observed in the @xmath11 and @xmath14 spectra . in the inclusive single jet production the data is compared to a nlo qcd calculation  @xcite , which agrees well with many inclusive observables for the older opal data .",
    "however for the l3 data , see figure  [ fig : ppbar]b ) , which go to a higher @xmath15 , there is again a clear deviation observed  @xcite .",
    "for small photon virtualities , large s and large momentum transfer from the photons to the hadrons , treating the @xmath16 system in leading twist perturbation theory , the transition amplitude factorizes into a hard scattering amplitude @xmath17 + a single hadron distribution for each hadron  @xcite .",
    "the hand bag model adds a soft 2-hadron distribution amplitude in what is basically a power correction .",
    "the handbag model predicts the ratio @xmath19=1  @xcite , while the leading twist calculation would predict a ratio of 2 .",
    "aleph , delphi  @xcite , and with higher statistics , but still preliminary , belle  @xcite have measured these decays and find indeed that the ratio is around 1 over the full w range .",
    "the handbag model also predicts a 1/sin@xmath20(@xmath21 ) behavior for the differential cross section , which agrees well with the data .",
    "comparing predictions made in the framework of the hard scattering approach  @xcite with the @xmath22 baryon - antibaryon cross section one is sensitive to the quark structure of the baryon .",
    "reasonable agreement with the quark - diquark model  @xcite is found by the l3 , opal , cleo and belle  @xcite experiments in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 final states , see figures  [ fig : ppbar]c)-[fig : ppbar]e ) , although the belle data starts to challenge the diquark model , while three - quark model  @xcite predictions are too low .",
    "the @xmath26 spectra can be used to fit the parameters of the handbag model , and hence make predictions for the cross sections of all other baryon octet members  @xcite , using one additional parameter @xmath27 - a ratio of form factors of the proton .",
    "they agree with the @xmath24 and @xmath25 measurement by cleo and l3  @xcite , see figure  [ fig : ppbar]c ) ,  [ fig : ppbar]d ) .",
    "one notes that for @xmath28 below 2.6 gev there are experimental discrepancies between the belle and cleo experiments for the @xmath23  [ fig : ppbar]e ) and between the l3 and cleo experiments for the @xmath24  [ fig : ppbar]c ) final states , which should be resolved .      the l3 experiment measured @xmath30 and @xmath31 processes  @xcite .",
    "a simple partial wave analysis was performed on the 4-pion final states , including only @xmath32 partial waves plus a 4 @xmath33 isotropic background , fitting the data separately for each w bin .",
    "the only contributing waves have a @xmath34 of @xmath35 and @xmath36 as shown in figure  [ fig : rhorho ] . from this result",
    "one would conclude , that the isospin ratio of the @xmath32 cross sections is incompatible with either i=0 or i=1 .",
    "the l3 experiment also analyzed the two - photon production of @xmath37 in the single tagged mode at @xmath38 = 89 - 209 gev  @xcite , which allow a test of the qq , gg @xmath39 meson - pair mechanism .",
    "the @xmath37 signal was separated from the @xmath40 and 4@xmath33 backgrounds with the box method .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhorho]c ) shows the @xmath41 differential cross section as a function of @xmath42 , which agrees well with the generalized vector dominance model .",
    "in tagged two - photon decays the process @xmath44 in the region of large @xmath42 but small @xmath45 factorizes into a perturbatively calculable part dominated by short distance scattering  @xcite : @xmath46 or , @xmath47 and non perturbative matrix elements measuring the transitions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , called generalized distribution amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "cleo has a preliminary measurement of the @xmath43 cross sections for different @xmath42 and w bins shown in figure  [ fig : rhorho]d ) .      until recently @xmath51 has only been seen in gluon rich environments such as @xmath52 annihilation or j/@xmath53 decay .",
    "although quenched lattice calculations indicate a mass of the @xmath54 glueball around 2gev , some glueball content of the @xmath51 can presently not be excluded .",
    "the l3 experiment reported a first observation of the @xmath51 in two - photon collisions  @xcite with a @xmath55 = 49 @xmath56 12 ev . since two - photon partial width of glueballs should be very small",
    ", this would indicate that the @xmath51 is mostly not a glueball .",
    "cleo has analyzed 13.8fb@xmath57 of data collected around the @xmath58 energies and searched for @xmath59 decays  @xcite .",
    "there is no @xmath51 resonance observed and an upper limit for the two - photon partial width of 14.4 ev is obtained .",
    "this result , which includes all systematic errors , is 2.9 @xmath60 below the l3 result .",
    "figure  [ fig : etacprime]a ) shows the cleo data with the fit result and overlayed the signal ( line ) with errors ( dashed ) , as expected from the l3 result .",
    "the total existing experimental knowledge of the hyperfine splitting in any meson system is the @xmath61 = m(j/@xmath53)-m(@xmath62 ) = 117 @xmath56 2 mev .",
    "the measurement of @xmath61 = m(@xmath63)-m(@xmath1 ) is important for the understanding of the spin - spin interaction in the confinement region .",
    "theoretical predictions based on potential model calculations are m(@xmath1 ) @xmath64 3594 - 3629 mev , with a two - photon partial width ratio of @xmath65 0.7 .",
    "a crystal ball measurement  @xcite at 3594 @xmath56 5 mev could not be confirmed by other searches  @xcite .",
    "recently the belle experiment published an @xmath1 observation in @xmath66  @xcite with a mass of 3654@xmath566@xmath568 mev and a significance of more than 6@xmath60 .",
    "the belle experiment also observed a @xmath1 signal in the mode @xmath67  @xcite with a mass of 3622@xmath5612 mev and a significance of 3.4@xmath60 . the babar experiment has presented a preliminary @xmath1 signal  @xcite in two - photon decays with a mass of 3633@xmath565@xmath561.8 mev .",
    "the cleo experiment has analyzed 13.9fb@xmath57 taken with the cleo ii detector  @xcite , see figure  [ fig : etacprime]b ) and finds a signal at a mass of 3642.7@xmath564.0 mev with a significance of 4@xmath60 , a significance which assumes the mass or width of the resonance not to be known .",
    "cleo confirmed this observation using 9.2fb@xmath57 of data from the cleoiii detector  @xcite , see figure  [ fig : etacprime]c ) , finding a mass of 3642.5@xmath563.4 mev ( no systematic error included ) and a significance of 5.7@xmath60 .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 ( cleo ii ) @xmath69 ( cleo iii ) , with statistical errors only .",
