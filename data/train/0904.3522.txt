    "thermodynamics of small quantum objects coupled to quantum environments in the low temperature regime has attracted considerable interest as the need for a better theoretical understanding increases in response to novel experimental manipulation of such systems . in particular ,",
    "the finite coupling strength between system and environment gives rise to some quantum subtleties and so can no longer be neglected ( calling for methods addressed by ` quantum thermodynamics ' @xcite ) whereas ordinary quantum statistical mechanics is intrinsically based on a vanishingly small coupling between them .    at the heart of quantum thermodynamics ,",
    "the foundational question as to the validity of the second law of thermodynamics comes up .",
    "in fact , with its challenge the applicability of thermodynamics is at stake .",
    "so far , the validity of this basic law has extensively been examined in the scheme of a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to an independent - oscillator model of a heat bath ( quantum brownian oscillator ) in equilibrium at a low temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it has been argued here that there is a violation of the clausius inequality representing the second law @xcite in such a way that @xmath5 at @xmath6 with respect to a variation of a hamiltonian parameter of the coupled oscillator , namely , either its mass or spring constant . in the above relation ,",
    "@xmath7 is the heat and @xmath8 is the entropy change .",
    "however , following the second law in its kelvin - planck form , which states that it is impossible to devise a machine ( _ i.e. _ , a heat engine ) which , operating in a cycle , produces no effect other than the extraction of heat from a thermal energy reservoir and the performance of an equal amount of work @xcite , it has been demonstrated that an apparent excess energy in the coupled oscillator at zero temperature @xmath9 is less than the minimum value of the work ( equivalent to the helmholtz free energy at a constant temperature ) to couple the free oscillator to a bath so that the second law is not violated down to zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this result has been generalized to a cyclic process of coupling and decoupling between the oscillator and a bath at an arbitrary temperature by obtaining the positive - valuedness of the minimum work needed for the coupling minus the maximum useful work obtainable from the oscillator in the decoupling ( the second law with respect to a variation of the coupling strength ) @xcite .",
    "this positive - valuedness is actually at its maximum at zero temperature and asymptotically vanishes with increasing temperature , whereas the classical counterpart would identically vanish at an arbitrary temperature ( even for a non - vanishing coupling ) .",
    "it was further claimed here that this quantum behavior is associated with the system - bath entanglement induced by the finite coupling strength between them ( clearly , the coupled total system ( _ i.e. _ , the coupled oscillator plus bath ) is in a thermal state with ( partial ) entanglement whereas the decoupled total system is simply in a separable state ) .",
    "it has , indeed , been found that at zero temperature the energy fluctuation in the coupled oscillator can provide entanglement information @xcite .",
    "this claim was supported by the numerical analysis of the system - bath negativity as an exact entanglement measure @xcite that the negativity behavior versus temperature is in accordance with the above quantum behavior of the second law up to the existence of the critical temperature above which the negativity vanishes",
    ".    it has also been shown @xcite that the clausius inequality ( in terms of the equilibrium temperature of the _ total _ coupled system and the von - neumann entropy of the coupled oscillator ) is actually violated with respect to a variation of the mass of the coupled oscillator ( not a variation of the coupling strength ) ; the behavior of this violation versus the temperature is essentially different from that of the system - bath negativity so that it has been concluded that the system - bath entanglement is not responsible for the violation of the clausius inequality .",
    "however , as the reduced equilibrium density operator of the coupled oscillator is not in form of the canonical thermal state @xmath10 , there is not a well - defined _ local _ temperature of the coupled oscillator ( especially in the low temperature limit ) so that applying the equilibrium temperature of the _ total _ coupled system for the violation of the clausius inequality for the subsystem ( actually with respect to a variation of a _ local _ parameter of the coupled oscillator , namely , either its mass or spring constant ) is not justified .",
    "further , this violation was actually based on the numerical findings @xcite that the heat @xmath7 exchanged with a bath in a reversible variation of the local parameter is always strictly greater than @xmath11 , which , however , does not satisfy the equality condition of a well - defined clausius inequality for the reversible process .    on the other hand , introducing some generalized entropic measure and using its maximum condition @xcite it has been shown that the clausius inequality obtained in some operational form is valid under such a generalization @xcite . however , this approach is not directly applicable for the quantum brownian oscillator since the reduced density operator of the coupled oscillator in equilibrium ( _ cf_. equations ( [ eq : united_expression1 ] ) and ( [ eq : united_expression12 ] ) ) is not in form of the stationary state obtained from the maximum condition of this generalization .    in this paper",
    "we intend to resolve the above controversial issue by introducing an effective clausius inequality with no violation , well - defined in the scheme of quantum brownian oscillator .",
    "to do so , we begin with considering the reduced density operator of the coupled oscillator .",
    "the quantum brownian motion in consideration is described by the model hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the spring constants are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . from the hermiticity of hamiltonian ,",
    "the coupling constants @xmath16 are obviously real - valued .",
    "the total system is assumed to be in the canonical thermal equilibrium state @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the partition function . from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite ,",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath20 in terms of the susceptibility @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the normal - mode frequencies of the total system @xmath23 . for an uncoupled oscillator",
    ", @xmath24 obviously reduces to @xmath25 and thus @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for the well - known drude model ( with a cut - off frequency @xmath28 and a damping parameter @xmath29 ) , which is a prototype for physically realistic damping",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath30 in terms of the digamma function @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the coefficients @xmath35 here we have adopted , in place of @xmath36 , the parameters @xmath37 through the relations @xcite @xmath38 and then @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the equilibrium density operator of the coupled oscillator is known as @xcite @xmath42 for an uncoupled oscillator this easily reduces to a well - known expression @xcite @xmath43 where the parameter @xmath44 let us now derive a closed form of the matrix elements @xmath45 in the basis composed of the eigenstates @xmath46 of an uncoupled oscillator to confirm its deviation from a ( diagonal ) form of the canonical thermal state @xmath47 . after making lengthy calculations ,",
    "every single step of which is provided in a detail in appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] , we arrive at the closed expressions    @xmath48    in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath49 @xcite . here , the four dimensionless quantities @xmath50 as shown , the reduced density matrix @xmath51 is symmetric with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "subsequently we also find ( _ cf_. appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] ) that for @xmath53    @xmath54    in terms of the jacobi polynomial @xcite and for @xmath55 the matrix elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond , respectively , to ( [ eq : prob20 ] ) and ( [ eq : prob21 ] ) with exchange of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "on the other hand , from ( [ eq : prob01_zero ] ) , @xmath69 where either @xmath70 or @xmath71 . as seen , the reduced density matrix @xmath72 is , in general , not in diagonal form of the canonical thermal state @xmath73 being valid for an uncoupled oscillator , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this confirms that there is not a well - defined _ local _ temperature when one keeps starring at the oscillator @xmath76 , hence ignoring that it ( strongly ) couples to a bath ( _ cf_. section [ sec : eigenvalue ] , in which , on the other hand , a well - defined effective local temperature is introduced ) .",
    "we note here , however , that by using @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the matrix elements ( [ eq : united_expression12 ] ) with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as is the case for an uncoupled oscillator , @xmath81 and likewise @xmath82 . actually , it can straightforwardly be verified that @xmath83 with @xmath84 odd .",

    "we will next consider the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the reduced density operator @xmath85 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem to be solved reads @xmath97 where the matrix element @xmath98 is given in ( [ eq : density_operator1 ] ) , and the eigenvalue @xmath99 is the probability of finding the @xmath66th eigenstate of the _ coupled _ oscillator .",
    "following the idea used in @xcite , we put an ansatz @xmath100 ( _ cf_. ( [ eq : eigenfunction1 ] ) ) into the integral in ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem1 ] ) , which will yield @xmath101 here @xmath102 with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 where the dimensionless quantities @xmath105 the integral in ( [ eq : integral_hermite1 ] ) can be evaluated in closed form of @xcite @xmath106 for @xmath107 to be an eigenstate of the operator @xmath85 , from equations ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem1])-([eq : eigenvalue_problem2 ] ) with ( [ eq : integral_hermite2 ] ) we need to require the argument of the hermite polynomial , @xmath108 to equal @xmath109 , which immediately gives @xmath110 and subsequently the probability for the @xmath66th eigenstate @xmath107 as @xmath111 as a result , we obtained the eigenvalues @xmath99 and the eigenstates @xmath107 in closed form .    from comparison between ( [ eq : parameter_c ] ) and ( [ eq : effective_c ] )",
    ", we introduce an effective mass @xmath112 and an effective frequency @xmath113 , which satisfy the relationship @xmath114 for an uncoupled oscillator , this obviously reduces to @xmath115 . for a later purpose ,",
    "it is useful to note that either @xmath112 or @xmath113 is not yet determined . the probability in ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem5 ] )",
    "can then be rewritten as @xmath116 in terms of @xmath117 with an effective temperature @xmath118 and subsequently as @xmath119 in terms of an effective partition function @xmath120 .",

    "we can easily confirm that @xmath128 which can subsequently be used for the internal energy @xmath129 ( note again , though , that since @xmath113 is not yet determined , @xmath130 ) .",
    "further , choosing the effective frequency @xmath131 from ( [ eq : mass_frequency_rel1 ] ) , we then have @xmath132 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath133 and @xmath134 here @xmath135 is the spring constant of the uncoupled oscillator @xmath76 .",
    "all effective parameters are now uniquely determined in terms of the starred quantities , namely , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , the effective temperature @xmath138 , and the internal energy @xmath139 where @xmath140 ( _ cf_. note , on the other hand , that clearly @xmath141 ) . with the aid of ( [ eq : x_drude ] ) and ( [ eq : p_drude ] ) , figure [ fig : fig1 ]",
    "demonstrates that @xmath142 , which leads to @xmath143 from @xmath144 .",
    "we will use the effective oscillator with @xmath145 in section  [ sec : clausius ] for a generalization of the clausius inequality .",
    "let us consider the thermal entropy of the effective uncoupled oscillator @xmath146 ( of course , @xmath147 , too , as its special case ) , which is @xmath148 we can immediately verify that this is identical to the von - neumann entropy of the coupled oscillator , @xmath149 @xcite ( note again that @xmath150 ) . from figure [ fig : fig2 ] , it is shown that @xmath151 increases with the magnitude of the damping parameter and also with the temperature of the total system .",
    "now we briefly comment on the introduction of effective parameters : first , it has been shown in @xcite that the coupled oscillator with @xmath152 at zero temperature of the total system @xmath153 can be interpreted as an uncoupled one with @xmath154 in a thermal state with a finite effective temperature @xmath155 ( with @xmath156 ) , where @xmath157 . using the very same technique",
    ", we have generalized this result into @xmath158 in ( [ eq : mass_frequency_rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : effective_temperature1 ] ) for an arbitrary temperature of the total system .",
    "it is interesting to note here that @xmath159 though , where @xmath160 .",
    "secondly , it is also known @xcite that the coupled oscillator can exactly be seen as an uncoupled oscillator with an effective frequency @xmath161 and an effective mass @xmath162 in the canonical thermal state @xmath163 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath164 ) , which can be well understood simply as a special case of @xmath158 in ( [ eq : mass_frequency_rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : effective_temperature1 ] ) ( note again that these are not the starred quantities ) .",
    "however , @xmath165 , either , whereas @xmath166 introduced below equation ( [ eq : special_effective_frequency1 ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the internal energy @xmath167 of the coupled oscillator with an alternative definition @xcite @xmath168 where the partition function @xmath169 . here",
    ", @xmath170 denotes the partial trace for the bath alone ( in the absence of a coupling between system and bath , the function @xmath171 would exactly correspond to the partition function of the system only ) .",
    "then it immediately follows that @xmath172 where @xmath173 .",
    "therefore the energy @xmath174 is not valid for the reduced system alone .",
    "the entropy @xmath175 can also be introduced here @xcite , which is , however , different from the von - neumann entropy @xmath176 for the reduced density matrix @xmath85 of the coupled oscillator .",
    "actually , the entropy @xmath177 can not be derived from the jaynes maximum entropy principle @xcite applied for the reduced system whereas the entropy @xmath178 can be so with the effective temperature @xmath0 . as a result , all thermodynamic quantities resulting from the partition function @xmath179 are not appropriate for the well - defined _ local _ thermodynamics of the reduced system .",
    "we will discuss the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the clausius inequality . to do so , we need the relationship obtained from ( [ eq : hamiltonian_internal_energy1 ] ) , @xmath180 where @xmath181 corresponds to an amount of heat added to the coupled oscillator , and @xmath182 an amount of work on the oscillator @xcite . for a later purpose ,",
    "we first consider the well - defined clausius inequality for a weakly coupled oscillator @xmath183 for a typical reversible process we have either a variation of the mass of the oscillator or a variation of its spring constant in such a way that @xmath184 respectively ( _ cf_. it is also noted that @xmath185 and @xmath186 ) .",
    "we thus confirm the equality sign in equation ( [ eq : second_law2_0 ] ) .",
    "next we consider the clausius inequality in the process of coupling between oscillator and bath .",
    "the coupling process can be represented in terms of a variation of the damping parameter such that for a reversible process , @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 equation ( [ eq : coupling_variation_second_law1 ] ) can be evaluated in closed form with the aid of equations ( [ eq : x_drude])-([eq : parameter_change0 ] ) such that @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 and @xmath193 in terms of the digamma function @xmath194 and the trigamma function @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "here we obtained equations ( [ eq : derivative_x_drude_gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : derivative_x_dot_drude_gamma ] ) for the overdamped case @xmath196 , which is , still , found to hold for the underdamped case @xmath197 as well , being expressed in terms of the functions with complex - valued arguments .",
    "then we get a violation of the clausius inequality , @xmath198 as seen from figure [ fig : fig3 ] .    we , however , argue that this violation results from an inappropriate choice of temperature @xmath4 being defined for the _ total _ system . we now propose a well - defined form of the clausius inequality pertaining to the coupling process in such a way that @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the heat exchanged between the effective ( weakly coupled ) oscillator with @xmath201 in ( [ eq : special_effective_spring_constant1 ] ) and a bath at the equilibrium temperature @xmath202 with ( [ eq : special_effective_frequency1 ] ) . for an reversible process",
    "we then have @xmath203 which can be shown to be identical to @xmath204 with the aid of ( [ eq : coupling_variation_entropy1 ] ) and ( [ eq : coupling_variation_entropy2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , there is no violation of the clausius inequality ! from @xmath132 , we note that @xmath205 , in which @xmath206 for an uncoupled oscillator , and @xmath207 , where @xmath208 represents a cyclic process of the coupling and decoupling . from the first law @xmath209 with @xmath210 and thus @xmath211",
    ", it also follows that @xmath212 where , with the aid of ( [ eq : special_effective_spring_constant1 ] ) , @xmath213 figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows that @xmath214 , which immediately leads to no violation of the inequality @xmath215 . here",
    "it should be noted that we have appropriately selected the effective oscillator @xmath147 with @xmath216 from ( [ eq : mass_frequency_rel1 ] ) to introduce an effective temperature @xmath0 without any ambiguity , which is now a critical element for the well - defined clausius inequality in ( [ eq : effective_second_law00 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are now in a position to understand , by means of the clausius inequality ( [ eq : effective_second_law00 ] ) , the validity of the second law in a cyclic process of the coupling and decoupling between oscillator and bath at an equilibrium temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the validity has actually been shown for zero temperature @xmath217 in @xcite and later for an arbitrary temperature in @xcite by verifying the second law in its kelvin - planck form @xcite ; it states that the minimum work @xmath218 needed to couple the oscillator to a bath ( in a reversible process ) , being equivalent to the helmholtz free energy of the _ coupled _ total system minus the free energy of the _ uncoupled _ total system , can not be less than the maximum useful work obtainable from the oscillator when it decouples from the bath such that @xmath219 ( note the strict inequality and see below ) .",
    "here we have on the left hand side the internal energy @xmath220 as the maximum useful work obtainable from the oscillator on completion of the decoupling process .    for the coupling - decoupling process ( with a varying damping parameter @xmath221 ) , inequality ( [ eq : effective_second_law00 ] ) can be transformed to @xmath222 , which means , according to the kelvin - planck form , that the net work obtainable from the effective uncoupled oscillator ( with an accordingly varying parameter @xmath223 ) on completion of this cyclic process can not be greater than zero . for a reversible process",
    ", this inequality then reduces to @xmath224 which means that the minimum work @xmath225 done onto the oscillator for @xmath226 on completion of the coupling exactly equals the maximum useful work releasable from the oscillator on completion of the decoupling . for comparison , on the other hand , the free energy @xmath218 is , by definition , the minimum work done on _ both _ oscillator and bath so that we get the inequality in ( [ eq : kim_oconnell1 ] ) .",
    "anyhow , the second law holds in the coupling - decoupling process .",
    "now we consider the clausius inequality ( with a fixed coupling strength ) after completion of the coupling , which has been discussed so far , e.g. , in @xcite . note that we are now with the effective oscillator with @xmath227 at temperature @xmath228 . we can then show that for a reversible process , @xmath229 which follow from ( [ eq : effective_temperature1 ] ) , ( [ eq : effective_q_p_sqr ] ) , ( [ eq : special_effective_frequency1 ] ) and ( [ eq : special_effective_spring_constant1 ] ) , respectively .",

    "effective thermodynamic relations , see appendix [ sec : comment2 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have found a well - defined effective clausius inequality appropriate for the quantum brownian oscillator with _ any _ coupling strength .",
