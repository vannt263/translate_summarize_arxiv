    "its optical brightness ( @xmath6 ) indicates that the system has a massive companion . from optical spectroscopic observations ,",
    "its mass function was estimated to be @xmath7 m@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",

    "if the effect of soft x - ray irradiation on the surface of the secondary star is taken into account , a mass function @xmath11 m@xmath8 is obtained instead ( @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a lower limit for the mass of the compact object @xmath12 m@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the system is a black - hole candidate ( bhc ) .",
    "most bhc show transitions between soft and hard x - ray spectral states . in the soft state ,",
    "their x - ray spectrum consists of a thermal component and a power - law component ; in the hard state , the thermal component is insignificant and the power law is harder .",
    "the thermal component , which can be fitted by a blackbody or disk - blackbody spectrum with a temperature @xmath13  kev , is interpreted as thermal emission from the inner accretion disk .",
    "the power - law component is believed to be comptonised emission from a disk corona ( @xcite ) or from the high - speed infalling plasma near the black - hole event horizon ( @xcite ) .",

    "a rare transition to the hard state occurred in 2000 april  may ( @xcite ) .",
    "other short - duration transitions to a hard state were observed in 1997 and 1998 ( @xcite ) .",
    "lmc x-1 , another high - mass bhc in the lmc , has been seen in the soft state only .",
    "in contrast , cyg x-1 , the high - mass bhc in our galaxy , tends to be in the hard state for the majority of the time .",

    "the foreground galactic interstellar absorption in the direction of lmc x-3 is @xmath45  @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the intrinsic column density is @xmath0  @xmath46  @xmath2 .",
    "this holds both in the low - hard and in the high - soft state , and is in contrast to the larger intrinsic column density expected for a companion with a strong stellar wind .",
    "the non - detection of obvious emission lines in the rgs spectra also indicates the absence of wind matter ejected in previous epochs ( cf .",
    "the p cygni lines seen in cir x-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the _ xmm - newton _ spectral data rule out wind accretion from a massive companion .",
    "the high luminosity observed in the x - ray bands therefore requires the companion to overflow its roche lobe .",
    "observations of lmc x-3 in its x - ray low state allowed us to determine the mass and spectral type of the companion .",
    "the system was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_/om on 2000 april 19 .",
    "we obtained an average brightness @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 in the three _ xmm - newton / om _ optical bands . using the latest available matrix of colour transformation coefficients ( sas version 5.1 , file om_colortrans_0005.ccf )",
    ", we find that this corresponds to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "this implies a temperature @xmath53 @xmath0  @xmath54 @xmath0  @xmath55 and a spectral type b5 ( figure 5 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we infer that the companion is a slightly evolved star of mass @xmath56 @xmath0  @xmath20 @xmath0  @xmath57 m@xmath8 .",
    "no significant wind is expected from such a star , in agreement with the low column density inferred from the x - ray data .",
    "it has been suggested ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that the companion is a main sequence b3 or b2.5 star ( @xmath20 @xmath9  @xmath10 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "such a star could also have the observed absolute magnitude @xmath58 but would have much higher bolometric luminosity and temperature ( bluer colors ) .",
    "however , their observations were carried out when the surface of the companion star was stronly heated by the x - ray source , and are therefore less reliable than our _ xmm - newton_/om observation for a spectral classification .    the mean mass density in the roche lobe of the companion star is uniquely determined by the binary period ( @xcite ) : @xmath59 we plot in figure 6 the evolutionary tracks in the ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) plane for a typical lmc metallicity @xmath62 ( eg , @xcite ) , compared with the mean density inside the roche lobe .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a radius of @xmath63 .",
    "stars with a mass @xmath3 m@xmath8 would be very close to filling their roche lobe .",
    "hence , mass transfer would occur mainly via roche lobe overflow , in agreement with our x - ray observations .",
    "a more massive companion would not fill its roche lobe .",
    "in particular , a b3v companion would only fill less than half of the volume of its roche lobe . in that case , the mechanism of mass transfer would have to be a stellar wind .",
    "this is ruled out by the uv / optical colours and by the low column density inferred from the rgs data .",
    "we have shown that the x - ray spectrum of lmc x-3 in the low - hard state is consistent with a simple power law . as the system returns to the high - soft state ,",
    "the disk - blackbody component ( interpreted as emission from an accretion disk ) becomes more prominent .",
    "the luminosity in the low - hard state was @xmath64  erg  s@xmath26 ( 0.310.0  kev band ) .",
    "in the high - soft state , @xmath40  erg  s@xmath26 , higher than the eddington luminosity limit of an accreting neutron star , and consistent with the classification of lmc x-3 as a bhc .",
    "the low line - of - sight column density , even at such a high luminosity , rules out wind accretion from a massive companion , and requires that mass is transferred via rl overflow . in turns",
    ", this implies that the companion star is close to filling its rl .",
    "we have shown that the optical / uv brightness and colours of the companion star suggest that it is a slightly evolved b5 star of mass @xmath65 m@xmath8 , rather than a main - sequence b3 star as previously thought .",
