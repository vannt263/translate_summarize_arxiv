    "to study the behaviour of viscoelastic materials , one often uses rheological models that can be of voigt or maxwell type or a combination of these basic models @xcite .",
    "for example , the classical phenomenon of creep , in its simplest form , is known to be governed by a linear ordinary differential equation of order one , given by the linear voigt model : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the viscosity coefficient and @xmath2 is the modulus of the elasticity . for a given stress history @xmath3 ,",
    "the solution of ( [ 1111 ] ) is given by @xmath4 where for @xmath5 the material is at rest , without stress and strain .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is called the retardation time and has an analogous meaning to relaxation : it is an estimation of the time required for the creep process to approach completion .",
    "the expression @xmath7 is known as the creep function . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we generalize .",
    "fractional calculus has recently become an important tool in the analysis of viscoelastic phenomena , such as stress - strain relationships in polymeric materials : in @xcite the connection between the fractional calculus and the theory of abel s integral equation is shown for materials with memory , while a fractional order voigt model is proposed in @xcite to better simulate the surface wave response of soft tissue - like material phantoms . for an historical survey of the contributions on the applications of fractional calculus in linear viscoelasticty , see @xcite . in 1996 , mainardi investigated linear fractional relaxation - oscillation and fractional diffusion - wave phenomena @xcite .",
    "several other works in the same direction of research followed : for an introduction to the linear operators of fractional integration and fractional differentiation , accessible to applied scientists , we refer to @xcite ; for a comprehensive overview of fractional calculus and waves in linear viscoelastic media see @xcite ; for a book devoted to the description of the properties of the mittag - leffler function , its numerous generalizations and their applications in different areas of modern science , we refer to @xcite ; for a generalization of the partial differential equation of gaussian diffusion , by using the time - fractional derivative , in both the riemann  liouville and caputo senses , see @xcite .",
    "heymans and podlubny have given a physical interpretation of initial conditions for fractional differential equations with riemann ",
    "liouville fractional derivatives @xcite . here , motivated by such results , we examine fractional creep equations involving caputo derivatives of order @xmath8 .",
    "caputo derivatives were chosen because they have a major utility for treating initial - value problems for physical and engineering applications , where initial conditions are usually expressed in terms of integer - order derivatives @xcite .",
    "precisely , we begin by considering in section  [ sec:2 ] the following extension to : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a continuous function defined on @xmath12 $ ] . while the solution ( [ simple ] ) of ( [ 1111 ] ) is described by an exponential function , we show that the solution of ( [ pb1 ] ) is expressed in terms of the mittag - leffler function ( see theorem  [ z ] ) , which is a generalization of the exponential function and was introduced by mittag - leffler in @xcite , where he investigated some of their properties .",
    "the mittag - leffler function @xmath13 with @xmath14 is defined by the series representation @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the gamma function , valid in the whole complex plane . a straightforward generalization of the mittag - leffler function ( [ * * * ] ) , due to wiman @xcite and used here ,",
    "is obtained by replacing the additive constant @xmath17 in the argument of the gamma function in ( [ * * * ] ) by an arbitrary complex parameter @xmath18 : @xmath19 mittag - leffler functions are considered to be the queen functions of fractional calculus and they play a fundamental role in the solution to ( [ pb1 ] ) .",
    "details about the mittag - leffler function and their importance when solving fractional differential equations can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "here we transform ( [ pb1 ] ) as a volterra integral equation to obtain an explicit solution involving the mittag - leffler function ( see proof of theorem  [ z ] ) .",
    "moreover , we give a physical interpretation to the fractional order voigt model ( [ pb1 ] ) as a creep phenomenon , by finding the corresponding creep function ( theorem  [ thm:1 ] ) . under some assumptions on @xmath3 ,",
    "when it depends on @xmath20 ( nonlinear voigt model ) , in section  [ sec:3 ] we address the question of existence of positive solutions , which also contributes to the physical interpretation of the model ( theorem  [ result ] ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the existence of nontrivial positive solutions is obtained by means of the guo - krasnoselskii fixed point theorem .",
    "we end with an illustrative example and section  [ sec:4 ] of conclusions .",
    "viscoelastic relations may be expressed in both integral and differential forms .",
    "differential forms are related to rheological models and provide a more direct physical interpretation of the viscoelastic behavior .",
