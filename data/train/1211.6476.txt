    "the development of attosecond extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) laser technology in recent years has offered the opportunity to observe and control the dynamics of electrons and the coupling to nuclear dynamics in atoms and molecules on their natural time scale . in particular , the capability to lock xuv pulses to a near - infrared ( near - ir ) pulse has initiated the development of techniques in which the dynamics is triggered by the attosecond pulse and observed as a function of the delay between the xuv and the near - ir pulses .",
    "experimental observations include , among others , the time resolution of the auger decay @xcite , the dynamics of electrons in valence shell @xcite and excited states @xcite , shake - up processes @xcite , and delays in the photoemission of electrons from different bands in a solid @xcite or different sub - shells in an atom @xcite .",
    "in particular , observations of substantial time delays during photoionization of atoms have generated significant theoretical interest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements are often analyzed in terms of the so - called wigner - smith ( ws ) time delay ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ws time delay accounts for the delay in the propagation of a particle in a potential as compared to that of a corresponding free particle towards infinity in space in an atomic or molecular scattering scenario @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite , that this definition leads to a well - defined time delay as long as the potential vanishes quickly enough at large distances . in contrast , for long - range potentials , such as the coulomb potential , the ws time delay is an intrinsically ill - defined concept . in view of this deficiency of the ws time delay concept ,",
    "sometimes short- and long - range parts of a potential are considered separately ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a given problem",
    "it may however be unclear where such a separation is justified .",
    "furthermore , the ws time delay is often calculated via the derivative of the phase shift of the wavefunction with respect to the energy of the particle ( e.g. , @xcite).this time - independent approach does not enable an analysis of the delay as a function of time during the interaction .",
    "we therefore seek for an alternative time - dependent theoretical approach to calculate time delays in photoionization , which addresses some of the concerns regarding the ws time delay and its determination via the phase derivative outlined in the previous paragraph .",
    "we further attempt to apply such an approach in time - dependent numerical grid simulations which are known to be a powerful tool in calculating and analyzing processes on an ultrashort time scale .",
    "the present theoretical analysis of a time delay is intended to be general and not focused , in particular , on the recent streaking experiments .",
    "once formulated , tested and established this may turn out in future as a useful step towards understanding the physics of time delays in streaking experiments and other precise measurements of ultrashort time scales .",
    "our proposal is based on the quantum mechanical expression for the time a particle spends inside a certain region @xmath2 of a potential . by comparing this time to the corresponding time for a free particle , a time delay",
    "is given , which is well - defined for any finite region .",
    "this approach is also known to be the basis for the ws time delay itself , that is nothing else than the limit , if it exists , as the region @xmath2 grows to infinity @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , this fundamental definition of a time delay has not been applied in the analysis of time - dependent processes initiated or driven by ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "it however offers a few interesting features : first , as mentioned above , for any finite region @xmath2 the time delay is well - defined for any physical relevant potential and independent whether or not the limit for an extension of the region towards infinity exists .",
    "this enables a theoretical analysis in particular for long range potentials without any restriction of the potential .",
    "second , in the limit to infinity , if well - defined , the time delay should converge to the ws delay .",
    "third , the time delay can be determined as a function of time after the emission of the photoelectron , in case of a streaking experiment even during the interaction with the probe pulse .",
    "this expands the options for a theoretical analysis of ultrashort time - dependent processes .",
    "fourth , there is no a - priori separation of short- and long - range parts in the potential necessary and the influence of both contributions can be studied .    in this paper",
    "we present and discuss the application of the above - mentioned time delay concept to the photoionization process .",
    "we further show how the concept can be utilized in time - dependent numerical simulations on a grid using the back - propagation technique .",
    "while the theoretical approach is developed and formulated in 3d , we restrict ourselves to an implementation in 1d calculations .",
    "this is done in the present proof - of - principle study in order to carefully investigate the convergence of the results with respect to the grid parameters , which appears to be appropriate in view of the required resolution of time delays on the order of a few attoseconds .",
    "an application of the approach to more dimensions is straightforward .",
    "we also show that in our application of the concept the numerical results indeed agree with the ws time delay , in case the appropriate limit exists .",
    "we may emphasize that any time delay determined in the present context is well - defined , even in case of the coulomb potential , since we consider delays over finite ranges in space only .",
    "besides the introduction of this complementary concept and the demonstration of its application to photoionization , we consider one aspect of the recent observations of time delays using attosecond xuv pump and near - ir probe pulses , namely the impact of the probe pulse on the time delay introduced here .",
    "we may note that this time delay does not necessarily correspond to or fully include the time delay observed in recent streaking experiments , since our method calculates ( or measures ) the time delay directly in the time domain while , in contrast , in the streaking technique a time delay is determined indirectly via a momentum ( or energy ) measurement .",
    "since the probe pulse is usually ultrashort , the effect occurs over a finite time and , hence , during the propagation of the electron over a finite distance @xmath2 in the potential only .",
    "thus the present concept appears to be well suited and can therefore be used to analyze the impact of the probing pulse for short- as well as long - range potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first provide the basic definitions for the calculation of a time delay with and without a strong probing field and discuss the application in numerical simulations .",
    "we then show that the numerical results for single xuv photoionization are well - defined over finite distances but clearly do not converge as @xmath3 in the coulomb case , in agreement with the discussion given in the early work by smith @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical results are in good agreement with those for the original ws time delay in case of a short - range potential .",
    "finally , we investigate the impact of an ultrashort near - ir probing pulse on the results for the time delay .",
    "our results indicate that the effect is small as long as the intensity of the probe pulse does not exceed @xmath0 w/@xmath1 .",
    "in this section we introduce the theoretical method , which we use to obtain time delays associated with the ionization of a target system in numerical simulations . to this end",
    ", we will first provide a set of basic definitions used in the method before we discuss its use in numerical simulations .      for a particle in a given state @xmath4 the time spent inside a region @xmath2 with a potential @xmath5",
    "can be expressed as ( hartree atomic units , @xmath6 are used throughout the paper ) @xcite : @xmath7 while @xmath8 is , in general , finite for finite regions and any @xmath4 , it is useful to compare @xmath8 to the time spent by the free particle in @xmath2 ( or another reference time ) : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the free particle state corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath11 defines the time delay associated with @xmath4 , the region @xmath2 and the potential @xmath5 : @xmath12 the quantity @xmath13 is known to have a finite limit as the radius of @xmath2 grows to infinity if the interaction vanishes quickly enough @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath14 ( and the associated quantum mechanical operator ) is well - defined for short - range potentials @xmath5 only .",
    "provided that the limit exists , @xmath14 can be also expressed as the energy derivative of the phase shift @xmath15 induced by the potential @xmath5 : @xmath16 which is commonly known as the wigner - smith ( ws ) time delay .    the definition given above provides a useful concept to calculate time delays in time - dependent processes , in particular on an ultrashort time scale . while it is known as the basis for a derivation of the ws time delay in scattering scenarios , to the best of our knowledge it has not been applied for the theoretical analysis of processes initiated or driven by ultrashort intense laser pulses . as an application , we intend to obtain time delays in the form of the time difference , given in eq .",
    "( [ num_delay ] ) , for a photoionization process .",
    "physically , we are interested in the time that an - initially bound - electron needs to leave a certain region ( centered about the location of the residual target ) following ionization due to the interaction with an external light field . to this end",
    ", we note that the expressions above can be readily applied to a particle in a superposition of states and therefore consider the ionizing part ( i.e.  the continuum parts ) of the wavefunction @xmath17 in our adoption of eq .",

    "we renormalize the wavefunction via division by @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ time_ion ] ) in order to be able to compare times and time delays arising for the ionization from different initial bound states @xmath21 .",
    "we can then define the time delay associated with the ionization from a specific initial bound state analogous to eq .",
    "( [ num_delay ] ) as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the free particle state corresponding to the ionizing part of the wavefunction after transition from the initial state @xmath21 .",
    "according to this definition we expect negative values for the time delays , since a free wave packet should spend more time in a given region @xmath2 than the corresponding wave packet that has the same asymptotic energy propagating in an attractive potential .",
    "we expect that @xmath24 has a well - defined finite limit ( for @xmath3 ) , i.e.  the wigner - smith time delay , for short - range potentials , but not necessarily for long - range potentials such as the coulomb interaction . in view of the intrinsic negative time delays for finite regions ,",
    "we expect that the limit value is negative as well .",
    "we also consider the difference in the time delays for the ionizations from two different initial states @xmath21 and @xmath25 as : @xmath26      in order to use the above definitions in a numerical simulation of a photoionization process we need to identify the ionizing part of the wavefunction @xmath17 as well as the corresponding free particle state @xmath27 . since it is not straightforward to obtain e.g.  the time of ionization ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the form of the wave packet after the transition into the continuum , it appears to be difficult to make use of eq .",
    "( [ ion_delay ] ) in a numerical simulation directly .",
    "we circumvent this obstacle by using the back - propagation technique .",
    "we first solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) of the system , initially in the state @xmath21 , under the interaction with the external light field on a space - time grid : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the momentum operator and @xmath30 represents the interaction with the ionizing light field .",
    "after the end of the interaction with the light field we separate the ionizing part of the wavefunction from the remaining bound parts , either via projection onto analytically or numerically known states or via spatial separation of the ionizing part at large distances on the grid .",
    "after removal of the bound parts we propagate the remaining ionizing part of the wavefunction backwards in time without taking account of the interaction with the light field using two different hamiltonians , once including the potential @xmath5 : @xmath31 and once as a free particle : @xmath32 in order to calculate the time delay @xmath24 for a given region @xmath2 , the wavepacket has to be located outside of @xmath2 at the start of the back - propagation and the propagation needs to be terminated as the wavepacket reaches the center of @xmath2 , i.e.  the location of the residual target ion .",
    "the latter point will be further discussed in the application of the method below .",
    "the theoretical method outlined above is , in general , applicable to ionization of an atom or molecule in any light field .",
    "here we present results for the application to photoionization of an electron initially bound in two different model potentials .",

    "it is necessary to point out that for the coulomb potential the time delay also depends on the distance that the ionizing wave packet is propagated in forward direction .",

    "the absolute value of the time delay decreases towards zero as the frequency of the ionizing xuv pulse and , hence , the final kinetic energy of the emitted electron increases ( cf .  panel a ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the effect of the potential on the motion of the electron becomes negligible in the limit of infinitely large kinetic energy of the electron ( i.e.  infinite large xuv frequency ) and therefore the time spent in the potential approaches that of the free particle in this limit .",
    "we further find that the absolute value of the time delay decreases with an increase of the xuv pulse duration ( panel b ) .",
    "this dependence is closely related to that presented in fig .",
    "[ delay_omega_pulseduration](a ) and can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "due to the finite pulse duration the ionized electron wave packet has a certain bandwidth about a central kinetic energy .",
    "consequently , the time delay obtained for the wave packet can be considered as an average over contributions at particular electron energies within the bandwidth ( weighted by the ionization probability at a given energy ) .",
    "as indicated by the results in panel ( a ) the time delay does not change linearly with the kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the time delay obtained for a wave packet will be smaller than its contribution at the central kinetic energy or the expectation value of the kinetic energy .",
    "this difference decreases and , thus , the time delay for the wave packet increases as the energy bandwidth of the wave packet decreases , i.e.   as the pulse duration increases .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the ionizing wavepacket increases as the xuv pulse duration increases , which also causes the time delay to increase .    for each of the results from the time - dependent simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ delay_omega_pulseduration ] we also calculated the ws time delay for photoionization , as described in the previous subsection .",

    "we may note parenthetically , that our simulations results also agree well with those of classical calculations ( not shown ) in which the time delays are determined by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the expectation value of the kinetic energy @xmath105 of the electron for a given ionized wave packet .",
    "in an attosecond streaking experiment @xcite , an ir field is used to map time information to the momentum space .",
    "one of the questions that arise in this context is whether or not the streaking field influences the observed quantities .",
    "although the time delays introduced here do not necessarily correspond to those observed in recent streaking experiments , we can show , in general , how the effect of the streaking field can be studied with our present method . to this end , we will first discuss how the streaking field can be included in the numerical simulations of time delays and then study the impact of a streaking ir field on the time delays for the short - range yukawa as well as the long - range coulomb potential by varying the parameters of the streaking field .",
    "the streaking field is represented by an additional potential @xmath106 which we consider as part of the potential @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) .",
    "thus , in the present calculations the streaking field is considered on equal footing with the atomic potential .",
    "after ( forward ) propagation of the wavefunction from its initial state and separation of the bound and ionizing part of the wavefunction , we then propagate the ionizing part of the wavefunction backwards once within the combination of the atomic potential and the streaking field and once as a free particle .    as a result",
    "we obtain the time delay , associated with the ionizing part of the wavefunction in the combined potential of the short- or long - range interaction and the streaking field as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the time the ionizing wave packet spends in region @xmath2 in the presence of the ( short- or long - range ) potential and the ir streaking field , and @xmath11 is the time for the free particle case .    here , the forward propagation of the wavefunction has to be continued as long as the ir streaking field is present .",
    "as noted above , for the long - range coulomb potential the time delay depends on the distance the wavepacket is propagated in forward direction . in order to keep the corresponding error small in our current analysis we used a large grid of @xmath109 a.u . to @xmath110 a.u . and stopped the forward propagation when the expectation value of the ionizing wave packet reaches 8000 a.u .. we increased the spatial step to @xmath111 and the time step to @xmath112 as compared to the previous calculations .",

    "the same argument applies to the weak dependence of the coulomb results on the distance of forward propagation in our simulations .",
    "for both potentials , we see that the time delay difference @xmath87 oscillates for @xmath123 .",
    "this oscillation is due to the presence of the ir field , since the ionized wave packet propagated up to about @xmath124 before the ir streaking field ceased in the present simulations .",
    "we note that the differences @xmath87 are small , less than 3% for the yukawa potential and less than the numerical error of 1% for the coulomb potential , compared to the time delays induced by the atomic potentials themselves .",
    "in the present calculations we therefore do not find a significant effect of the streaking field , neither for a short - range nor for a long - range potential . before we continue to further study the influence of the ir streaking field , we note a subtle point in the results obtained for the coulomb potential , which are presented in fig .",

    "while neither the time delays with and without streaking field converge as a function of the outer boundary @xmath81 , we find a converged result ( within the numerical error ) for the time delay difference @xmath87 , if the xuv pulse is centered about the zero of the vector potential of the streaking field ( see green solid line in fig .",
    "[ ir_delay_r](d ) ) .",
    "this occurs since in this case the momentum distribution of the ionizing wave packet at the end of the forward propagation is the same as that of the no streaking field case . in contrast , if the xuv pulse is applied at the maximum of the vector potential of the streaking field , the final momentum distribution is shifted and thus no convergence of the time delay difference within the range of present boundaries is found ( see blue dashed line in the inset of fig .  [ ir_delay_r](d ) ) .    .",

    "[ ir_delay_xuv_omega ] we present the results for the time delay obtained in ( a ) the yukawa potential and ( b ) the coulomb potential with ( blue open squares ) and without ( blue filled circles ) streaking field as a function of the xuv frequency .",
    "since the results are in close agreement we also show the relative difference between them ( green filled triangles ) , which does not exceed 5% and 2% in the yukawa and coulomb case , respectively .    as one would expect , the relative difference between the results for the time delay obtained with and without streaking field do increase with an increase of the ir streaking field intensity .",
    "this can be clearly seen from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ delay_difference_ir_intensity ] .",
    "it appears that for ir intensities up to @xmath130 w/@xmath1 the relative difference between the results is small enough such that there is no significant effect on the time delay .",
    "while the relative difference quickly increases beyond 10% in the case of the yukawa potential with a further increase of the ir intensity , the 10%-limit is not reached for an ir intensity of @xmath0 w/@xmath1 in the case of the coulomb potential .",
    "in summary , we have applied a fundamental definition of time delay to time - dependent numerical simulations on the grid . to this end , we have obtained the difference between the time a particle spends in a finite region of a potential and the time a free particle spends in the same region using a back - propagation technique .",
    "our method expands the options for a theoretical analysis of ultrashort time - dependent processes . for any finite region in space",
    "the time delay introduced here is well - defined , even for long - range potentials , and time delays can be determined as a function of time after the emission of the photoelectron .",
    "the method is applied to photoionization of an electron in a short - range yukawa as well as a long - range coulomb potential by an attosecond xuv pulse .",
    "it is found that the numerical results are in excellent agreement with those for the ( asymptotic ) ws time delay , obtained as the derivative of the phase shift with respect to the energy , for the short - range potential .",
    "in contrast , the numerical results in the case of the coulomb potential are finite for any finite region , but they do not converge as the region increases to infinity , as expected .",
    "the well - defined time delays for a finite region enabled us to study the impact of a near - infrared streaking ( or probing ) pulse for both potentials .",
    "for the time delays introduced in this paper , our results show that the effect is small as long as the intensity of the probing field is below @xmath0 w/@xmath1 .",
