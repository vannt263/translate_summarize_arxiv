    "let us suppose we are given a medium containing sensitive information which , for some reason , we want to dispose of in a secure way , i.  e. in such a way that neither we nor anyone else can have access to  or be deemed to possess  that information anymore . in many everyday situations , particular precautions have to be taken in advance in order to counter unwanted _ data remanence _",
    ", i.  e. the persistence of data that were nominally erased or removed .",
    "when dealing with macroscopic objects , the irreversibility of dissipative processes is generally enough to provide a _ practically secure _ erasure of data ( think of e.  g. shredding the medium ) .",
    "however , such a conclusion is _ in - principle _ completely inadequate .",
    "let us suppose in fact that the medium carrying the information is represented by the state of a microscopic object obeying the laws of quantum mechanics . since quantum evolutions are globally reversible , also information has to be globally preserved , and any sort of _ true _ information erasure is thus forbidden  @xcite .",
    "even so , information could be , if not erased , _ hidden _ or encoded in such a way to achieve what a secure disposal of information is meant to achieve .",
    "our aim here is to introduce and analyze a model - independent paradigm of secure information disposal , suitable to describe both classical and quantum information disposal , and naturally encompassing the ideal situation in which the only limitations to data processing are those imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics .    in order to do so ,",
    "let us consider the following protocol : let @xmath0 denote the initial bipartite state shared between two parties  the active player ( or _ receiver _ ) @xmath1 and the passive and inaccessible reference system ( or _ remote sender _ ) @xmath2 . according to a common understanding , the amount of correlations existing in @xmath0 between subsystems @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 can be interpreted as the amount of information that @xmath1 carries or possesses _ about _ @xmath2 .",
    "since the content of the message is assumed to be private ( otherwise there is no reason to require security in its disposal ) , we suppose that the state @xmath0 is decoupled from other accessible quantum systems , in particular from the local environment  i .",
    "e. the ` trash ' system  of @xmath1 .",
    "the goal for @xmath1 is to securely dispose of the information she has about @xmath2 . by identifying information with correlations ,",
    "this means that she has to reduce her correlations with @xmath2 by applying local operations on her share only ( as @xmath2 is not accessible ) , _ and _ without transferring any of these correlations into her local environment ( as this is assumed to be accessible to adversaries ) .",
    "we name this protocol _",
    "( local ) private quantum decoupling _ ( pqd ) .",
    "pqd constitutes a novel instance of the general task of producing , under various constraints , an uncorrelated ( or , equivalently , ` factorized ' ) state out of a correlated one .",
    "the importance of studying decoupling protocols lies in the fact that , with appropriate constraints , it is possible to quantitatively characterize diverse properties of quantum correlations with respect to their robustness _ against _ decoupling .",
    "such an approach has been introduced independently in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , and contributed in recognizing the central role that decoupling plays in quantum information processing : for example , the primitives of state merging  @xcite , state redistribution  @xcite , and the ` mother ' protocol  @xcite , are all based on decoupling arguments , and decoupling procedures form the building blocks of many recently constructed coding theorems achieving quantum capacity  @xcite .",
    "hence , pqd offers a new point of view on the study of quantum correlations , with possible implications in entanglement theory and quantum cryptography .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , previous approaches to quantum decoupling are described and the new paradigm of pqd is motivated through simple examples .",
    "the rigorous definition of pqd is given in section  [ sec:3 ] by defining eliminable and ineliminable correlations , and the concept of private local randomness as a resource is introduced . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we prove general bounds on pqd when acting on an arbitrary mixed state , and show that ineliminable correlations are in fact monogomous correlations , in the sense that they can not be freely shared .",
    "this is a feature common to many distinctively quantum correlations , like e.  g. entanglement ( when suitably measured ) .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] deals with the asymptotic limit where infinitely many identical and independent copies of a given state are available : in this case , the optimal rate for pqd is explicitly calculated as being expressed by the coherent information . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we discuss some examples for which pqd assumes a particularly simple form .",
    "a connection between pqd and random - unitary channels is exhibited , together with an open question concerning the latter .",
    "finally , section  [ sec:7 ] describes the relations existing between ineliminable correlations , quantum entanglement , and other ` quantum ' correlations present in an arbitrary bipartite quantum state .",
    "here we show that ineliminable correlations represent an entanglement parameter , in the sense given by  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec:8 ] concludes the paper with a brief summary of the results obtained and possible directions to investigate in future .",
    "all quantum systems considered in the following are finite dimensional , in the sense that their attached hilbert spaces @xmath3 are finite dimensional .",
    "we use greek letters like @xmath4 for pure quantum states , while letters like @xmath5 are reserved for mixed states .",
    "the usual ket - bra notation @xmath6 denoting the rank - one projector onto the state @xmath7 is generally abbreviated simply as @xmath8 .",
    "roman letters label the systems sharing a quantum state : for example , @xmath0 is a mixed state defined on the composite system @xmath9 , carrying the hilbert space @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the shannon entropy , is known to measure both the degree of correlation existing between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , iff @xmath17 and @xmath18 iff @xmath19 , namely , @xmath20 is a function of @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite . ] as well as `` the reduction in the uncertainty of @xmath12 due to the knowledge of @xmath13 '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite p.20 ) .",
    "we hence say that @xmath13 carries a total of @xmath22 bits of information about @xmath12 .",
    "the classical arguments given above can be straightforwardly generalized to the quantum case as follows .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , given a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 , the _ quantum mutual information _ ( qmi )",
    "@xcite defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the von neumann entropy of a state @xmath25 and @xmath26 $ ] , provides a sound and operationally meaningful measure of the total amount of correlations present in @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 , while @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 is purified by @xmath1 . moreover , when systems @xmath2 and @xmath1 are classical , qmi coincides with its classical counterpart .",
    "it makes sense then to say that the system @xmath1 carries a total of @xmath31 ( quantum ) bits of information about @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the information content , as we defined it , turns out to be positive and symmetric , that is , the amount of information @xmath1 carries about @xmath2 equals the amount of information @xmath2 carries about @xmath1 , since @xmath32 .",
    "when the state @xmath0 is clear from the context , we will simply write @xmath33 to indicate @xmath31 , and , in case the state is multipartite like , for example , @xmath34 , we will denote @xmath35)$ ] simply by @xmath36 or even by @xmath37 .",
    "we finally recall here also the notion of _ coherent information _",
    "@xcite which is well - known in the literature to play a fundamental role in entanglement theory and quantum shannon theory and is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "contrarily to qmi , coherent information can be negative and it is not symmetric as there is a preferred directionality in its definition .",
    "suppose two players , alice ( @xmath1 ) and a referee ( @xmath2 ) , share a bipartite quantum state @xmath39 .",
    "we say that they are _ decoupled _ if and only if @xmath40 .",
    "if the initial state is not decoupled , a decoupling procedure aims at transforming the initial state @xmath39 into ( something close to ) a factorized state .",
    "it is clear that , without imposing any constraint on the decoupling procedure , the whole task is trivial : one can always _ prepare _ , even _ locally _ , an exactly decoupled state after having discharged the input into the environment .",
    "if we want to probe some property of quantum correlations using decoupling , the main point is then to choose appropriate constraints making the best decoupling strategy non - trivial . in the following , before presenting our decoupling task , we will review two different types of decoupling tasks adopted in the literature .",
    "a first decoupling task is introduced through information - theoretical arguments .",
    "@xcite , with analogous though inequivalent arguments , prove that quantum mutual information @xmath41 provides an _ operational _ measure of total ( both classical and quantum ) correlations shared between @xmath1 and @xmath42 , in that @xmath41 quantifies the cost of erasing initial correlations . in particular , the decoupling protocol adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite is related with the theory of _ private quantum channels _",
    "@xcite and aims at constructing a local map @xmath43 of the form @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is close to some factorized state @xmath46 .",
    "the additional requirement posed in  @xcite is to use in  ( [ eq : e - rand ] ) the smallest possible number @xmath47 of unitary operators ( indeed , the average over the whole special unitary group @xmath48 achieves perfect decoupling , but it requires an infinite amount of randomness to be added ) .",
    "clearly , the number @xmath47 can in general depend both on the input state @xmath39 and on the degree of approximation required of the decoupling .",
    "@xcite proves that , in the i.i.d .",
    "asymptotic limit , exact decoupling can be achieved for values of @xmath47 as small as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the ( large ) number of copies of @xmath39 provided . following landauer s principle ,",
    "quantum mutual information is then interpreted as the total amount of correlations _ per copy _ , being the minimum cost ( measured in bits of extra - randomness borrowed from a randomness reservoir ) needed in the i.i.d .",
    "limit to achieve exact decoupling . a similar ,",
    "though not equivalent , conclusion can be drawn as a special case of the general setting introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a class of transformations different from  ( [ eq : e - rand ] ) is considered ( in particular , classical communication between the two parties is taken into account in an essential way ) .",
    "@xcite interprets quantum mutual information as a particular type of _ quantum deficit _ , being the minimum cost , measured in bits of entropy production , required by a decoupling process consisting of local unitaries and local orthogonal measurements only .    a second , quite different",
    ", definition of decoupling task is adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite : here the input state @xmath39 is drawn from a non - trivial set of possible input states ( constructed as the orbit of different seed states under the action of a unitary representation of a group ) , while the decoupling map can act _ globally _ and is required to achieve exact decoupling _ always _",
    "( there is no approximation here ) .",
    "it is then shown that some seed states induce orbits for which the optimal decoupling map can not be different from the completely depolarizing channel which transforms every state into the maximally mixed one .",
    "correspondingly , such correlations are called _ unerasable _ , as opposed to _ erasable _",
    "correlations , which are those that can be decoupled by a non - trivial map . such a distinction hence arises as an algebraic / geometrical property of the set of quantum states analyzed , depending on the seed state and the group acting on it .",
    "the decoupling task we propose here is independent of both previously mentioned approaches .",
    "in fact , as anticipated in the introduction , when performing pqd , we monitor not only the decrease of correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , but also the corresponding _ increase _ of correlations between @xmath2 and the environment ( causing the decoupling ) .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to see that the group - averaging channel @xmath43 of the form @xmath51 of which eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - rand ] ) aims at being a faithful approximation , when applied on @xmath1 , does not _",
    "truly destroy _ correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but simply _ transfers _ them to the environment , so that @xmath2 is no more correlated with @xmath1 , but is correlated with the environment .",
    "this can be explicitly seen by writing the stinespring purification  @xcite of the channel @xmath52 as an ( essentially uniquely defined ) isometry @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , acting as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a maximally entangled state .",
    "one can check that indeed it holds @xmath57,\\qquad\\forall\\sigma.\\ ] ] on the other hand , @xmath58=\\frac{\\openone_{e_1}}d\\otimes\\sigma_{e_2},\\qquad\\forall\\sigma.\\ ] ] in other words , the induced channel @xmath59 is _ noiseless _ : all correlations initially shared with @xmath2 are now _ perfectly _ transferred to the environment subsystem @xmath60 .",
    "( in fact , the same phenomenon happens with all channels preparing some fixed state regardless of the input . )",
    "we conclude that the approach adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite constitutes the opposite of what we want to achieve with pqd : in defining the latter , in fact , we will impose an upper bound on the amount of correlations transferred into the environment as a consequence of the decoupling process .    at this point ,",
    "the natural question arises  is the constraint we are going to impose well balanced ?",
    "in other words , does it induce some non - trivial situations where we can truly eliminate correlations , without merely ` jettisoning ' them into the environment , and some non - trivial situations where we can not ? as a first motivating example , let us consider the extreme case where the initial shared state is a pure state @xmath61 .",
    "again , due to stinespring s theorem  @xcite , whatever deterministic transformation alice could engineer can always be represented by an isometry @xmath62 , with @xmath54 , the share @xmath42 being alice s output , the share @xmath63 being the environment .",
    "in other words , the initial bipartite pure state @xmath61 gets transformed into the tripartite pure state @xmath64 thanks to the identity  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a tripartite pure state , we see that @xmath67 that shows that , if the initial state is pure , total correlations can not be eliminated but only moved from one system to another : pure state correlations constitute a _ conserved quantity_.    as a second motivating example , for which correlations are instead truly eliminable , let us consider the classically @xmath43 correlated state  @xcite @xmath68 where vectors @xmath69 s are orthonormal .",
    "then , by applying on @xmath1 the stinespring s isometry @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and the vectors @xmath73 s are orthonormal vectors such that @xmath74 for all @xmath75 , the resulting tripartite output state @xmath76 satisfies @xmath77 in other words , by applying @xmath78 , we obtained perfect decoupling between @xmath42 and @xmath2 ( since the state @xmath79 is factorized ) , however without correlating @xmath2 with @xmath63 ( since also the state @xmath80 is factorized ) . in this case , we say that the initial correlations in @xmath39 have been _ perfectly eliminated_.    in the rest of the paper we will study what happens when initial correlations belong to a general bipartite quantum state .",
    "the general situation will turn out to lie in between the two preceding examples , in the sense that we will be able to divide total correlations into those which are _ eliminable _ and those which are _ ineliminable _ , the latter representing some sort of conserved quantity behaving like the correlations present in pure bipartite states .",
    "according to the fact that in our scenario @xmath2 acts as the passive reference system with respect to which information is measured , the goal of approximate pqd is to minimize correlations with @xmath2 by acting with a channel ( i.  e. with a completely positive , trace - preserving map ) only on subsystem @xmath1 of @xmath0 , in such a way that the amount of correlations transferred to the environment during the decoupling process is upper bounded by a privacy parameter @xmath81 .",
    "we call this task @xmath82-pqd . the appropriate tool to analyze such a task",
    "is provided by the stinespring dilation of a channel  @xcite : given an input hilbert space @xmath83 ( of finite dimension @xmath84 ) , a channel @xmath85 , and an output hilbert space @xmath86 ( of finite dimension @xmath87 ) , there always exists a finite dimensional auxiliary hilbert space @xmath88 ( of dimension @xmath89 ) and an isometry @xmath90 , @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 $ ] , for all states @xmath25 on @xmath83 .",
    "such an isometric extension @xmath93 is unique up to local unitary transformations on @xmath88 , which represents the environment interacting with the system during the open evolution described by @xmath85 . before proceeding we",
    "shall notice that since everything here is finite - dimensional , minima and maxima appearing in the following are all achievable .    in practise",
    ", @xmath1 applies the isometry @xmath93 on her share , keeps the @xmath42 part and discards @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath82-pqd is mathematically characterized by the following quantity : @xmath94 where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the set of isometries @xmath97 such that @xmath98 and , without loss of generality since the roles of output subsystems @xmath42 and @xmath63 in the definition  ( [ eq : definition ] ) can be exchanged , @xmath99 in formula , @xmath100 the non - negative quantity @xmath101 , which we call @xmath82-_ineliminable information _ ( or , equivalently , @xmath82-_ineliminable correlations _ ) , measures the amount of correlations with the referee that alice can not eliminate , without discharging into the environment more than @xmath82 bits of them .",
    "we will refer to the parameter @xmath82 as the _ privacy level parameter _ : the two extreme cases , that is , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , correspond to _ perfect _ pqd and to _ advantage preserving _",
    "pqd , respectively . in the following , for sake of clarity",
    ", we will denote @xmath104 simply as @xmath105 .",
    "notice that @xmath106 if and only if @xmath107 .      already from the definition  ( [ eq : definition ] )",
    ", we can see that @xmath108 is invariant under local unitary operations , that is @xmath109 moreover , for all @xmath110 , @xmath111 since all the values of @xmath36 that are achievable with the constraint @xmath112 are also achievable with the looser constraint @xmath113 , but not viceversa , while the upper bound @xmath31 is trivially achieved when alice does nothing at all , in such a way that @xmath114 .",
    "implicitly , by giving alice the possibility of performing local isometric embeddings , we are providing her with free access to local pure states : indeed , an isometric embedding is nothing but a unitary interaction of the system with some pure ancillary state .    on the contrary ,",
    "let us think for a while to the opposite situation , like the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of local purity distillation , where alice is granted unlimited access to local randomness , that is , she can freely create maximally mixed states . in particular ,",
    "let us consider such a local randomness as being _ private _",
    ", i.  e. factorized from all other parties taking part  either actively or passively  into the protocol ( including the adversary eve ) . within this alternative scenario ,",
    "suppose that alice and the referee initially share some bipartite two - qubits state @xmath0 .",
    "since we allow local private randomness for free , we can actually consider the state @xmath115 where @xmath116 belongs to alice , namely , alice happens to be provided with two extra - bits of private randomness .",
    "the idea is now simple : alice can use these two extra - bits in order to securely decouple @xmath1 from @xmath2 .",
    "the decoupling isometry @xmath117 alice has to perform is given by @xmath118 where the @xmath119 correspond to the pauli s matrices @xmath120 .",
    "written @xmath121 , it is easy to check that @xmath122 that implies @xmath123 , for all @xmath82 . then , two extra - bits of private randomness in @xmath124 suffice to securely decouple any two - qubit state @xmath0 shared between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , no matter how correlated is the state @xmath0 .",
    "notice that this is in agreement with ref .",
    "it is important at this point to stress that , in order to eliminate correlations , the randomness in @xmath124 has to loose its privacy , since in general @xmath124 has to get correlated with @xmath1in fact , @xmath125 .",
    "this means that , even if the reduced state of @xmath124 still looks maximally mixed after the decoupling process , it does not represent anymore a fresh source of _ private _ randomness : in other words , there is no _ catalysis _ occurring here",
    ".    we can conclude saying that , if private local randomness is provided for free , correlations can always be perfectly eliminated : in this sense , the framework of pqd implicitly assumes that local private randomness has to be considered as a _",
    "resource_.    one final remark : from the preceding example , one should not jump to the conclusion that , in order to perfectly eliminate @xmath50 bits of total correlations , at least @xmath50 bits of extra - randomness are _ always _ needed .",
    "it is indeed possible to securely decouple a maximally pure state of two qubits , hence carrying _ two bits _ of total correlations , using only _",
    "one bit _ of extra randomness .",
    "see subsection  [ sec : economy ] for details .",
    "we now face the general problem of quantifying the amount of ineliminable correlations present in a given state @xmath0 which is neither pure nor simply classically correlated .",
    "the following proposition exhibits a useful lower bound on ineliminable correlations :    [ prop:1 ] for any given state @xmath0 , it holds that @xmath126 and @xmath127    * proof .",

    "if so , does it admit an easier characterization ?",
    "we already saw , in subsection  [ sec:4a ] , that there exist entangled mixed states that can be securely decoupled for all @xmath81 .",
    "there , we needed two extra - bits of private randomness in order to securely decouple whatever two - qubits state , in agreement with the fact that a two - qubits state contains at most two bits of total correlations . however , before rushing to the conclusion that we _ always _ need at least @xmath50 extra - bits of randomness to perfectly eliminate @xmath50 bits of total correlations , we should consider the following example where _ just one _ extra - bit of randomness is required to securely decouple a maximally entangled pure state of two qubits ( hence carrying two bits of total correlations ) .",
    "let us consider indeed the state acting on @xmath220 defined as @xmath221 where @xmath222 . for this state , even if @xmath124 carries only _",
    "one _ bit of extra - private randomness , one can show that @xmath223 .",
    "the proof is easy , as the null value is achieved by the isometry @xmath224 , with @xmath225 , defined as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is coherently performing the measurement needed to teleport the maximally mixed state @xmath228 from @xmath124 to @xmath2 .",

    "we already saw how random - unitary noise , that is classical noise in the sense explained in subsection  [ subsec : randu ] , only induces perfectly eliminable correlations between the reference and the environment .",
    "moreover , ineliminable correlations satisfy the two axioms required in ref .",
    "@xcite for a measure of quantumness : they are zero for classically correlated states  ( [ eq : abcc ] ) and they are invariant under local unitary transformations  ( [ eq : uni - inv ] ) .    also , being upper bounded by one half of the quantum mutual information and being equal to the entropy of entanglement for pure states , ineliminable correlations fall under the hypotheses of theorem  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which proves that , for an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath39 with @xmath238 , it holds @xmath239 where @xmath240 is a fannes - type function  @xcite , that is a positive , concave , continuous , monotically increasing function which depends on the dimension of the underlying hilbert space only logarithmically and satisfies @xmath241 .",
    "( [ eq : reverse ] ) shows that , whenever the amount of ineliminable correlations in a bipartite state is sufficiently large , then such a state is necessarily entangled , since also coherent information has to be correspondingly close to the upper bound @xmath242 .    in this sense",
    ", ineliminable correlations can be considered ` genuinely quantum ' correlations , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : reverse ] ) tells us that they constitute an entanglement _ parameter _ , in the sense explained in  @xcite , namely , the more ineliminable correlations are present , the more the state is entangled ( coherent information is the paramount example of an entanglement parameter ) , even though ineliminable correlations do not satisfy many natural requirements to be a proper entanglement _",
    "measure_. in reinforcing this interpretation , it stands the fact , expressed by corollary  [ coro : monog ] , that ineliminable correlations indeed satisfy a monogamy constraint , which is another strongly distinctive feature of quantum correlations versus classical ones .",
    "another interesting feature of ineliminable correlations is that , for every state @xmath39 , they always represent ( already at the level of a single copy ) _ at most one half _ of the total amount of correlations , that is , @xmath243 always .",
    "this fact is to be compared , once again , with what happens for different measures of ` quantum vs classical ' correlations : according to different definitions , there exist quantum states exhibiting quantum correlations _ without _ classical correlations , hence representing a strikingly counterintuitive situation  . on the contrary , assuming for a while the definition of quantum correlations as the ineliminable ones , every quantum state would turn out to be always more correlated classically than quantum , hence reinforcing the common - sense intuition about correlations .",
    "however , in spite of this encouraging list of properties , the existence of entangled  even maximally entangled  states with perfectly eliminable correlations only ( recall the examples analyzed in subsections  [ sec:4a ] and  [ sec : economy ] ) seems to stand as an insurmountable argument against the maybe naive statement ` what is ineliminable is quantum ' .",
    "we however think that the dichotomy proposed here can contribute to the program of understanding the structure of total correlations , as coming from the _ operational _ paradigm of distant laboratories , versus the notion of entanglement , which is the _ formal _ property of not being separable .",
    "we introduced the operational task of private quantum decoupling ( pqd ) , which naturally arises as a model - independent description of secure disposal of information .",
    "partial results suggest that there may be a deep connection between the theory of pqd and the theory of quantum entanglement .",
    "further research in this direction would be in order .",
    "moreover , it could be useful to generalize the asymptotic results presented here to the one - shot scenario , by exploiting some recently introduced tools  @xcite .",
    "also , pqd could turn out to be useful in designing quantum cryptographic protocols , where the possibility of securely erasing old data and keys is required  @xcite .",
