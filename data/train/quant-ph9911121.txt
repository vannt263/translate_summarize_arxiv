    "<S> introduction . * the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) problem @xcite is concerned with the analysis of schrdinger type operators where the small electron to nucleon mass ratio , plays the role of the semiclassical parameter . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theory identifies distinct energy scales : the electronic scale which , in atomic units , is of order one and the scale of nuclear vibrations which is of order @xmath1 in these units . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the nucleus to electron mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the electrons as the fast degrees of freedom is central to the theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the clean splitting between fast and slow degrees of freedom fails near eigenvalue crossing of the electronic hamiltonian where there is strong mixing between electronic and vibrational modes . </S>",
    "<S> this lies at the boundary of the conventional bo theory . </S>",
    "<S> since the coupling between different electronic energy surfaces becomes infinite near a crossing , the nuclear wave function does not reduce to a solution of a scalar ( second order ) schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the ( double surface ) nuclear wave function near an isotropic conical crossing , for energies close to the energy of the crossing .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong mixing of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom near crossing leads an anomalous zeeman effect . to describe the anomaly recall that the zeeman splitting in molecules </S>",
    "<S> is reduced compared to the zeeman splitting of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to parameterize the reduction by a parameter @xmath3 so that the zeeman splitting is of the form ( and order ) @xmath4 with @xmath5 the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the low lying vibrational levels have large reduction , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is what one expects from nuclei whose magnetic moments are by factor @xmath2 smaller than the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> levels _ near the crossing energy _ can have a small reduction expressed by the fact that @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for the isotropic situation we calculate @xmath8 , so that the zeeman shift is anomalously large , by a factor of about 2000 , than the normal zeeman splitting of molecular levels . more precisely , we find that the zeeman splitting near isotropic crossing is @xmath9 the sign @xmath10 means equality in the limit @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is proportional to the magnetic field , with a coefficient dependent only on the electronic wave functions at the crossing . </S>",

    "<S> .    one can formulate the bo problem in the following way @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , the electronic hamiltonian , depends parameterically on the nuclear coordinates @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> when time reversal is not broken , @xmath18 is a real symmetric matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner von neumann crossing rule @xcite says that @xmath18 has generically a crossing point for two modes of vibrations , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall consider the simple scenario where @xmath18 is a @xmath21 matrix of and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we shall treat only the restriction of the electronic hamiltonian to the two dimensional subspace spanned by the two degenerate eigenstates at the crossing point . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that @xmath18 has a single crossing point at @xmath22 , and set the crossing energy at @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that the crossing is conic , that @xmath18 is isotropic about the origin , and that the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath18 is smooth near the origin . </S>",
    "<S> this is a common model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first recall why the standard bo theory fails near a crossing . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath18 is symmetric it can be diagonalized by an _ orthogonal _ </S>",
    "<S> transformation @xmath24 . in the @xmath21 case , and when @xmath18 is non - degenerate , @xmath24 is uniquely determined , up to an overall sign , by requiring @xmath25 . hence , away from crossing , @xmath26 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the two eigenvalues of @xmath18 . </S>",

    "<S> crossing , @xmath30 as @xmath19 surrounds the origin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this forces a @xmath31 singularity of the vector potential for small @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> far from the origin , to leading order in @xmath32 , the two components of the wave function decouple and are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a semiclassical solution of the schrdinger equation with potential @xmath35 in the cut plane with antiperiodic boundary conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this decoupling holds provided @xmath36 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall henceforth denote @xmath37 , and refer to the region @xmath38 as `` far from the crossing '' . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the divergence of the off diagonal part of @xmath39 near the crossing prevents such a decoupling near the crossing . our aim is to analyze the bo theory , to leading order in @xmath40 , near the crossing of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason one can still hope to say something useful near the crossing is that the asymptotic form of @xmath18 near the crossing , i.e. for @xmath42 , is universal @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the pauli matrices </S>",
    "<S> . we shall refer to @xmath42 as `` close to the crossing '' . notice that our notions of close and far from the crossing have a nonempty intersection . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to match the solution close to the crossing with the standard , decoupled , bo solution , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> everything to be said from now on is true in the limit of @xmath11 , to leading order in negative powers of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that zero is an eigenvalue of ( [ hbo ] ) , since there is always an eigenvalue that is close enough to zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out to be convenient first to unitary - transform ( [ can2 ] ) with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this will replace @xmath46 in ( [ can2 ] ) by @xmath47 . in this representation , </S>",
    "<S> close to the crossing the zero energy wave function satisfies approximately the differential equation @xmath48 @xmath49 stands for a two component column matrix and @xmath50 is a scaled variable .    the operator @xmath51 commutes with the operator on the l.h.s .  of ( [ scaled2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it does not have the meaning of total angular momentum , since the pauli matrices do not represent spin . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider solutions of the differential equation ( [ scaled2 ] ) which are eigenfunctions of @xmath52 with an eigenvalue @xmath12 , namely : @xmath53 @xmath54 are the polar coordinates related to @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 must be _ half odd integer _ </S>",
    "<S> , for the wave function to be single valued . separating variables , the radial equation obtained from ( [ scaled2 ] ) , in the @xmath12-th sector , takes the form : @xmath56 of the four linearly independent solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaled ] ) , basically due to boundary conditions , only one linear combination is fit to represent a wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we denote it by @xmath57 and its components by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 is to a crossing point what the airy function is to a classical turning point @xcite : it interpolates between the near region where the wave function is intrinsically a two component spinor , and the far region where the wave function is highly oscillatory and given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 has a closed expression in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions of the kind @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it has the asymptotic ( for @xmath61 ) form @xmath62 solving ( [ scaled ] ) asymptotically near the origin gives@xcite @xmath63 solving ( [ scaled ] ) asymptotically at infinity we obtain @xmath64 the four dimensional family of solutions can be parameterized by either @xmath65 or @xmath66 . requiring the solution to be bounded at the origin and at infinity means ( for positive @xmath12 ) that @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> imposing three homogeneous conditions on a four dimensional linear space leaves us with one dimensional subspace , i.e.  a certain function times an arbitrary constant . </S>",
    "<S> this is the celebrated @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> while the reason we require @xmath69 to be bounded at the origin is obvious , the reason we require it to be bounded at infinity is a bit subtle , since ( [ scaled ] ) is meaningful only close to the crossing . </S>",
    "<S> however , `` close to the crossing '' , @xmath70 , extends farther and farther in terms of @xmath71 as @xmath2 gets large . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 at ( [ infinity ] ) should be exponentially small , and can set to zero to leading order .    </S>",
    "<S> the solutions which are regular at the origin can be obtained from the fourth order differential equations , one for each component @xmath73 , obtained from ( [ scaled ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are related to the differential equation that defines the generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the two linearly independent solutions that are regular at the origin are @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 are generalized hypergeometric functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the linear combination @xmath76 is bounded at infinity provided @xcite : @xmath77 we have set the global coefficient in front of ( [ f ] ) such that ( [ cos ] ) will be true . </S>",
    "<S> formulae ( [ hyper_solutions1]-[a ] ) are correct only for positive @xmath12-s . their negative counterparts can be obtained by interchanging the lower and upper components , as can be seen from ( [ scaled ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * the anomalous zeeman shift . </S>",
    "<S> * let us now turn to the zeeman shift . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field breaks time reversal symmetry , which means that it adds an the imaginary term to @xmath18 , in the representation where @xmath18 is real . </S>",
    "<S> generically the magnetic field will remove the conical intersection of @xmath18 at @xmath22 and create a gap between the two energy sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the gap will be proportional to the magnetic field in atomic units , and the coefficient will be in general of order one . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore introduce the magnetic field into our model by adding the term @xmath78 to @xmath18 at ( [ can2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no harm in taking @xmath5 to be independent of @xmath19 , since only the value of @xmath5 in the origin will be of importance to us . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is therefore a constant , proportional to the magnetic field in atomic units . </S>",
    "<S> we shall not minimally couple the magnetic field directly to the vibrations for this turns out to be a weaker effect , of order @xmath79 , while the shift mediated by the electrons , in the rotationally invariant case , is @xmath80 , as we shall see .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the case where the rest of @xmath18 , namely the @xmath81 part in ( [ can2 ] ) , does not break the full rotational symmetry of its linear part , so that @xmath12 is still a good quantum number .    in the rotational invariant case , the model has , for @xmath82 , a two - fold degeneracy : the states @xmath12 and @xmath83 are degenerate . the magnetic field @xmath5 breaks this degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting is twice the zeeman shift in the energy for the two states @xmath84 move in opposite directions .    </S>",
    "<S> equipped with approximants to the wave function near and far from the crossing , with a degenerate perturbation theory one can calculate , to leading order in @xmath32 , the zeeman splitting and obtain ( [ main2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we describe this calculation in details elsewhere @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we would only like to sketch the derivation of the power in ( [ main2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> far from the crossing , one can neglect the vector potential in ( [ shbo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wkb approximant to the radial part of @xmath85 is @xmath86 where we have employed the linearity of the energy surfaces near the crossing . it is a general property of the wkb approximation , that the normalization coefficient @xmath87 is independent of @xmath2 , to leading order in @xmath32 . from ( [ cos ] ) and ( [ psi_cl ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the interpolation of the bo radial wave function towards the crossing is @xmath88 @xmath5 removes the degeneracy of the electronic levels at @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap created there due to @xmath5 is equal to @xmath89 . intuitively , the zeeman shift of a vibrational level will be proportional to the amount of probability density in the vicinity of the crossing times @xmath5 . by  </S>",
    "<S> vicinity \" we mean a neighbourhood of order @xmath90 of the origin , the area of which is of order @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the density associated with the wave function is large there and by ( [ interp ] ) is proportional to @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the weight is proportional to @xmath93 which gives the power of the zeeman splitting in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ main2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of proportion will include an integral over the components of @xmath94 , @xcite , which gives @xmath14 @xmath95 n gives the factor @xmath96 , where @xmath13 is @xmath97 the integration is carried out between the two turning points of @xmath98 , the negative energy sheet ( [ shbo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ period ] ) is proportional to the time in takes a particle with a unit ( electronic ) mass to travel classically across the potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is independent of the nuclear mass , and @xmath99 has the order of magnitude of electronic energies . from the invariance under @xmath100 of @xmath101 it follows that @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> one motivation for this work was an attempt to gain some understanding of the different status of crossing in theory and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> theory puts crossing and avoided crossing in distinct baskets : conic crossings come with fractional azimuthal quantum numbers while avoided crossings come with integral quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , measurements of molecular spectra normally can not tell a crossing from near avoided crossing . only with _ precision _ </S>",
    "<S> measurements @xcite and _ precise _ quantum mechanical calculations @xcite can one tell when molecular spectra favor an interpretation in terms of crossing and half integral quantum numbers or avoided crossing with integral quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> zeeman splitting appears to be a useful tool to study crossing . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly of crossing is characterized by a fractional power @xmath3 of the molecular reduction of the zeeman splitting , @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> a system of choice for studying crossing is molecular trimers @xcite . since trimers are not rotationally invariant eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ main2 ] ) does not apply and we can not conclude that near crossing @xmath8 for trimers . however , it is natural to expect that the qualitative features of our results carry over also to the non - isotropic case where crossing will manifest itself by an anomalously large zeeman splitting and a _ fractional _ @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting challenge to calculate or measure the value of @xmath3 for ( other ) molecular crossings , and trimers in particular . </S>"
