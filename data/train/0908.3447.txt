    "since the early stages of quantitative nonlinear sciences , numerous conceptual approaches have been introduced for studying the characteristic features of dynamical systems based on observational time series @xcite .",
    "popular methods that are increasingly used in a variety of applications ( see , for example , @xcite ) include ( among others ) lyapunov exponents , fractal dimensions , symbolic discretisation , and measures of complexity such as entropies and quantities derived from them .",
    "all these techniques have in common that they quantify certain dynamically invariant phase space properties of the considered system based on temporally discretised realisations of individual trajectories .    as a particular concept the basic ideas of which originated in the pioneering work of poincar in the late 19th century @xcite ,",
    "the quantification of recurrence properties in phase space has recently attracted considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "one particular reason for this is that these recurrences can be easily visualised ( and subsequently quantified in a natural way ) by means of so - called recurrence plots obtained from a single trajectory of the dynamical system under study @xcite . when observing this trajectory as a scalar time series @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , one may use a suitable @xmath2-dimensional time delay embedding of @xmath0 with delay @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 , for obtaining a recurrence plot as a graphical representation of the binary recurrence matrix    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the heaviside function",
    ", @xmath7 denotes a suitable norm in the considered phase space , and @xmath8 is a threshold distance that should be reasonably smaller than the attractor diameter @xcite . to simplify our notation ,",
    "we have used the abbreviation @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 being the point in time associated with the @xmath11-th observation recorded in the time series ) wherever appropriate .",
    "experimental time series often yield a recurrence plot displaying complex structures , in particular , with different properties of the non - interrupted diagonal and vertical structures ( `` lines '' ) .",
    "a variety of statistical characteristics of the length distributions of these lines ( such as maximum , mean , or shannon entropy ) can be used for defining additional quantitative measures that characterise different aspects of dynamic complexity of the studied system in more detail .",
    "this conceptual framework is known as recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa )  @xcite and is nowadays frequently applied to a variety of real - world applications of time series analysis in various fields of research  @xcite . however , most of these rqa measures are sensitive to the choice of embedding parameters , which are found to sometimes induce spurious correlations in a recurrence plot  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have revealed that the fundamental invariant properties of a dynamical system ( i.e. , its correlation dimension @xmath12 and correlation entropy @xmath13 ) are conserved in the recurrence matrix  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the estimation of these invariants is independent of the particular embedding parameters .",
    "the recurrence plots preserve all the topologically relevant phase space information of the system , such that one can completely reconstruct a time series from its recurrence matrix ( modulo some rescaling of its probability distribution function )  @xcite .    a further appealing paradigm for analysing structural features of complex systems is based on their representation as complex networks of passive or active ( i.e. , mutually interacting ) subsystems .",
    "for this purpose , classical graph theory has been systematically extended by a large variety of different statistical descriptors of the topological features of such networks on local , intermediate , and global scales @xcite .",
    "these measures have been successfully applied for studying real - world networks in various scientific disciplines , including the structural properties of infrastructures @xcite , biological @xcite , ecological @xcite , and climate networks @xcite , to give some prominent examples .",
    "the corresponding results have triggered substantial progress in our understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics of such complex networks @xcite .",
    "the great success of network theory in various fields of research has recently motivated first attempts to generalise this concept for a direct application to time series @xcite . however ,",
    "a substantial number of the recently suggested techniques have certain conceptual limitations , which make them suitable only for dealing with distinct types of problems . as an alternative that may provide a unifying conceptual and practical framework for nonlinear time series analysis using complex networks",
    ", we reconsider the concept of recurrences in phase space for defining complex network structures directly based on time series . for this purpose ,",
    "it is straightforward to interpret the recurrence matrix @xmath14 as the adjacency matrix @xmath15 of an unweighted and undirected complex network , which we suggest to call the _ recurrence network _ associated with a given time series .",
    "to be more specific , the associated adjacency matrix is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the kronecker delta introduced here in order to avoid artificial self - loops .",
    "a corresponding conceptual idea has recently been independently suggested by different authors @xcite , but not yet systematically studied . in this work , we however aim to give a rigorous derivation and detailed interpretation for a variety of quantitative characteristics of recurrence networks .",
    "it shall be noted that a generalisation to weighted networks ( as partially studied in @xcite ) is straightforward if the recurrence matrix is replaced by the associated distance matrix between pairs of states . in any case ,",
    "recurrence networks referring to the mutual phase space distances of observational points on a single trajectory are spatial networks , i.e. fully embedded into an @xmath2-dimensional space , which has important implications for their specific topological features .",
    "we will raise this point in detail within this paper .",
    "the consideration of recurrence plots as graphical representations of complex networks allows a reinterpretation of many network - theoretic measures in terms of characteristic phase space properties of a dynamical system . according to the ergodicity hypothesis",
    ", we suppose that one may gain full information about these properties by either ensembles of trajectories , or sufficiently long observations of a single trajectory . following this line of ideas",
    ", we may approximate the ( usually unknown ) invariant density @xmath18 ( which is related with the associated invariant measure @xmath19 by @xmath20 ) of the studied system by some empirical estimate @xmath21 obtained from a time series , where @xmath8 defines the level of coarse - graining of phase space involved in this procedure . transforming the time series into a recurrence network then allows to quantitatively characterise the higher - order statistical properties of the invariant density @xmath18 by means of complementary methods , i.e. , network - theoretic measures .    according to the above argumentation",
    ", quantitative descriptors of the topological features of recurrence networks can be considered as novel measures within the framework of rqa .",
    "our technique therefore exhibits additional deep insights into the phase space properties of dynamical systems directly related to their complex dynamics .",
    "additionally , we will emphasise that we may also take seriously the duality of adjacency matrices of complex networks on the one hand , and recurrence matrices of dynamical systems on the other hand , which would also allow transferring concepts from dynamical systems theory ( given that the corresponding recurrence plot based estimates are invariant under temporal reordering ) to complex network theory . in this work , however , we will concentrate on a detailed discussion of how phase space properties can be further quantified in terms of network theory .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : section [ sec : review ] presents a critical review of existing approaches for extracting complex networks from time series , including a comprehensive discussion of their potentials and potential problems ( with a special emphasis on how to interpret the resulting networks topological properties ) .",
    "the concept of recurrence networks as a natural alternative is further discussed in section [ sec : recnet ] . in particular , it is demonstrated that many network - theoretic measures yield sophisticated quantitative characteristics corresponding to certain phase space properties of a dynamical system that have not yet been explicitly studied in terms of other dynamical invariants or measures of complexity based on rqa . in order to support our theoretical considerations ,",
    "section [ sec : examples ] provides some examples of how different network - theoretic measures reveal certain phase space properties of various dynamical systems .",
    "finally , we summarise our main results and outline some future directions of further methodological developments based on our proposed technique .",
    "in this section , a review and classification of existing approaches for studying the properties of time series by means of complex networks approaches is presented ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : methods ] ) .",
    "in particular , strengths and possible limitations of the existing approaches will be briefly discussed .",
    ".[vertexedgetable]summary of the definitions of vertices and the criteria for the existence of edges in existing complex network approaches to time series analysis ( given in chronological order ) . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]        as a first measure that allows to quantify the importance of a vertex in a complex network , the degree centrality of a vertex @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is defined as the number of neighbours , i.e.  the number of vertices @xmath24 that are directly connected with @xmath22 : @xmath25 note that in general , the sum is taken over all @xmath24 .",
    "however , according to our definition ( [ def : adjacency ] ) , we skip the corresponding condition in the following . normalising this measure by the maximum number of possible connections , @xmath26 , one gets the local connectivity @xmath27 which , from the recurrence plot point of view , corresponds to the local recurrence rate @xmath28 of the state @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the degree centrality and local connectivity yield an estimator for the local phase space density , since for a vertex @xmath22 located at position @xmath29 in phase space , @xmath30 ( when using the maximum norm ) and , hence , @xmath31    in complex network studies , one is often interested in the frequency distribution of degree centralities , @xmath32 , in particular , the presence of an algebraic scaling behaviour , which is characteristic for scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "however , although several authors have recently focussed their attention on this characteristic obtained from different types of complex networks derived from time series @xcite , we would like to underline that for a complete characterisation of the phase space properties of a dynamical system , one should prefer studying not only degree centralities , but also other higher - order statistical measures .      in some situations , it is useful not to consider the full distribution of degree centralities in a network , but to focus on the mean degree of all vertices @xmath33 as a simple characteristic quantity of this distribution , where @xmath34 is the total number of edges in the recurrence network .",
    "the mean degree centrality @xmath35 is directly proportional to the edge density @xmath36 of the network or , alternatively , its recurrence plot equivalent , the global recurrence rate @xmath37 , @xmath38 note that the recurrence rate coincides with the definition of the correlation integral @xmath39 , which is commonly used to estimate the correlation dimension @xmath12 , for example , using the grassberger - procaccia algorithm @xcite .",
    "the connection between the edge density and the correlation dimension can be understood by the fact that the local recurrence rate @xmath28 of a vertex @xmath22 corresponds to the measure of a @xmath2-dimensional ball @xmath40 of radius @xmath8 centered at the point @xmath29 in the @xmath2-dimensional phase space in the limit that time goes to infinity ( @xmath41 ) . when considering the euclidean norm as a distance measure in phase space ,",
    "these balls are defined as hyperspheres , for the maximum norm as hypercubes etc .",
    "then , the pointwise ( information ) dimension of the probability measure @xmath19 at @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 @xcite . due to the heterogeneity of the phase space visited by the trajectory ( i.e. , the non - uniform phase space density that results in different degree centralities @xmath23 in different parts of this space ) ,",
    "the proper estimation of @xmath44 is a nontrivial task and often requires expensive computational power and a high data quality and quantity .",
    "thus , one may expect a better statistics for @xmath12 , since it more heavily weights regions of the phase space which have a higher probability measure @xmath19 .",
    "though the correlation integral has been well established in the literature for estimating the correlation dimension , we point out the improvement in estimating @xmath12 based on the diagonal lines in @xmath45 , which yields an algorithm that is independent of the embedding parameters  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the recurrence network representation @xmath46 of a time series fully conserves the geometric properties of the phase space of the underlying dynamical system .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a vertex @xmath22 , @xmath47 , characterises the density of connections in the direct neighbourhood of this vertex in terms of the density of connections between all vertices that are incident with @xmath22 . in many networks ,",
    "such loop structures formed by three vertices occur more often than one would expect for a completely random network .",
    "hence , high clustering coefficients reveal a specific type of structure in a network , which is related to the cliquishness of a vertex @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the definition of clustering coefficient proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total number of closed triangles including vertex @xmath22 , which is bound by the maximum possible value of @xmath50 . for vertices of degree @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( isolated or tree - like points , respectively ) ,",
    "the clustering coefficient is defined as @xmath53 , as such vertices can not participate in triangles by definition .",
    "equation ( [ cc_local ] ) can be rewritten in terms of conditional probabilities as @xmath54 using bayes theorem , with @xmath55 and a similar expression for @xmath56 . as for a recurrence network ,",
    "the value of @xmath46 depends only on the phase space distance and the choice of @xmath8 , the latter relationship may be used to derive analytical results at least for one - dimensional systems based on their invariant density .",
    "corresponding details can be found in [ app_1dmap ] , including the corresponding treatment of the bernoulli and logistic maps as specific examples .      as for the degree centrality",
    ", one may consider the average value of the clustering coefficient taken over all vertices of a network , the so - called global clustering coefficient @xmath57 as a global characteristic parameter of the topology of a network .",
    "one expects that the value of @xmath58 is  for a given dynamical system with a phase space density @xmath18  in the asymptotic limit @xmath59 exclusively determined by the choice of @xmath8 , which determines the scale of resolution .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the corresponding effects and their implications for certain model systems will be given in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the mean nearest neighbour degree @xmath60 of vertex @xmath22 gives the average degree in the neighbourhood of @xmath22 , @xmath61 the degree centrality @xmath23 is a measure of the density of states in the immediate neighbourhood of state @xmath22 , whereas @xmath60 can be interpreted to indicate the mean density of states in the next neighbourhood ( next topological shell of neighbours ) of state @xmath22 .",
    "hence , both measures taken together contain information about the local density anomaly in the vicinity of @xmath22 , which we propose to measure by the local degree anomaly @xmath62 vertices with a positive degree anomaly ( @xmath63 ) hence indicate local maxima of phase space density , while such which @xmath64 correspond to local density minima .",
    "hence , the local degree anomaly may be considered as a proxy for the local heterogeneity of the phase space density . in a similar way",
    ", the average absolute value of the local degree anomaly , @xmath65 , serves as a measure for the overall spatial heterogeneity of the phase space density profile .",
    "a network is called assortative if vertices tend to connect preferentially to vertices of a similar degree @xmath66 . on the other hand",
    ", it is called disassortative if vertices of high degree prefer to connect to vertices of low degree , and vice versa .",
    "hence , assortativity can be quantified by the pearson correlation coefficient of the vertex degrees on both ends of all edges @xcite , @xmath67 ^ 2}{\\frac{1}{l } \\sum_{j > i } \\frac{1}{2 } ( k_i^2+k_j^2)a_{i , j } - \\left [ \\frac{1}{l } \\sum_{j > i } \\frac{1}{2 } ( k_i+k_j)a_{i , j } \\right]^2}.\\ ] ] if the density of states in phase space hardly varies within an @xmath8-ball , the degrees on either ends of an edge will tend to be similar and hence the assortativity coefficient @xmath68 will be positive .",
    "this means , that the more continuous and slowly changing the density of states is , the closer @xmath68 will be to its maximum value one . within the framework of recurrence networks , @xmath68 can hence be interpreted as a measure of the continuity of the density of states or put differently , of the fragmentation of the attractor .",
    "note that this aspect has not yet been specifically addressed by other nonlinear measures , in particular , within the rqa framework .",
    "the overlap of the neighbourhood spaces of two vertices @xmath69 is measured by the matching index    @xmath70    where @xmath71 if there are no common neighbours , and @xmath72 if the neighbourhoods coincide @xcite . using the notion of @xmath8-balls around points in phase space",
    ", one may alternatively write @xmath73    due to the spatial constraints of the recurrence network , the neighbourhood spaces of @xmath69 can only overlap if @xmath74 i.e. , @xmath71 for all pairs of vertices @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the matching index @xmath77 decreases on average with an increasing spatial distance @xmath78 between the two considered states . note that",
    "since @xmath79 already for @xmath80 , there may be unconnected points with a matching index @xmath81 .",
    "the matching index of pairs of vertices in a recurrence network is closely related to the concept of _ twins _ @xcite , which has recently been successfully applied for constructing surrogate data ( twin surrogates ) in the context of statistical hypothesis testing for the presence of complex synchronisation @xcite .",
    "twins are defined as two states of a complex system that share the same neighbourhood in phase space , i.e. , the two vertices of the recurrence network representing these states have a matching index @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the matching index can be used for identifying candidates for twins . note that pairs of vertices @xmath11 and @xmath82 in a recurrence network with @xmath83 can still be considered as _ potential _",
    "twins , since @xmath72 may in some cases be approached by only slight changes of the threshold @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , we suggest interpreting the matching index as a measure of the _ twinness _ of @xmath11 and @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that adjacent pairs of edges @xmath75 ( @xmath84 ) with a low matching index @xmath85 connect two distinct regions of the attractor and may therefore be indicative of geometrical bottlenecks in the dynamics ( cf .",
    "our discussion of the betweenness centrality in section [ sec : bc ] ) .        as we consider recurrence networks as undirected and unweighted , we assume all edges to be of unit length in terms of graph ( geodesic ) distance .",
    "consequently , the distance between any two vertices of the network is defined as the length of the shortest path between them .",
    "note that time information is lost after transforming the trajectory into a network presentation .",
    "therefore , the terminology of the shortest path length @xmath86 in the recurrence network reflects the minimum number of edges that have to be passed on a graph between a vertex @xmath11 to a vertex @xmath82 . in the same spirit",
    ", @xmath86 is related to the distance of states @xmath11 and @xmath82 in phase space .     ]     for a general non - periodic trajectory @xmath87 embedded in a two - dimensional phase space @xmath88 .",
    "[ nonperiodic_list ] ]    in order to better understand the meaning of shortest path lengths , let us study their calculation for two toy model series : first , we consider a periodic trajectory @xmath89 , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 , i.e.  there are @xmath92 points in the phase space ( fig .",
    "[ periodic_list](a ) ) .",
    "the corresponding recurrence plot is shown for @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ periodic_list](b ) ) . as it has already been mentioned above , the recurrence matrix @xmath94 and the adjacency matrix @xmath46 of the associated recurrence network",
    "are basically equivalent . adopting a common visualisation of connectivity patterns from the literature on complex networks ,",
    "we illustrate the recurrences of the considered model time series by placing the individual observations ( vertices ) on a circle with equal common distances ( fig .",
    "[ periodic_list](c ) ) . in this representation ,",
    "the shortest path length ( in the network sense ) between two vertices @xmath11 and @xmath82 corresponds to the smallest number of `` jumps '' in phase space via pairs of neighbours ( i.e. recurrences ) in phase space .",
    "obviously , the number of such jumps is determined by the prescribed value of @xmath8 and the spatial distance between @xmath11 and @xmath82 .",
    "for instance , the shortest path from vertex @xmath95 to @xmath96 is @xmath97 as indicated by the matrix of mutual shortest path lengths ( fig .",
    "[ periodic_list](d ) ) .",
    "note that this list is symmetric by definition , i.e. @xmath98 ) .",
    "the same heuristic analysis can also be performed for a general nonperiodic trajectory in phase space as shown in fig .",
    "[ nonperiodic_list](a - d ) .",
    "we wish to underline that the terminology of shortest path lengths in networks does not have a direct relevance to the dynamical evolution of the observed system .",
    "in contrast , @xmath86 measures distances in phase space ( among a discrete set of points on the attractor ) in units of the neighbourhood size @xmath8 . for example , in the periodic case displayed in fig .",
    "[ periodic_list ] , it takes @xmath99 iterations ( time points ) from vertex @xmath52 to @xmath100 in the time domain , while the shortest path to cover the phase space distance has only a length of @xmath101 .",
    "hence , shortest paths do not allow to infer the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "even more , for the path concept in a recurrence network , no information about the temporal order of the individual observations is considered ( for example , the shortest path between vertices @xmath52 and @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ periodic_list ] is given by the sequence ( 1,8,5,2 ) , which is not ordered in time ) .",
    "one should note that if the phase space is strongly fragmented ( for instance , in the period-3 window of the logistic map , which has been discussed elsewhere @xcite , the phase space consists of three discrete points ) , the resulting recurrence networks may be composed of different disconnected clusters .",
    "furthermore , there might be more than one shortest path connecting two nodes .",
    "for example , in the aperiodic example in fig .",
    "[ nonperiodic_list ] , the shortest path from node @xmath52 to node @xmath103 , ( @xmath104 as shown in fig .  [ nonperiodic_list](d ) ) , can be obtained by three different choices , that are , ( 1,2,6,7 ) , ( 1,5,3,7 ) , and ( 1,5,6,7 ) .",
    "the average path length @xmath105 is defined as the mean value of the shortest path lengths @xmath86 taken over all pairs of vertices @xmath75 , @xmath106 here , for disconnected pairs of vertices , the shortest path length is set to zero by definition .",
    "note that in most practical applications , this has no major impact on the corresponding statistics .",
    "the average phase space separation of states @xmath107 serves as an @xmath8-lower bound to @xmath105 , since @xmath108 due to the triangular inequality , and hence @xmath109 interpreted geometrically , this inequality holds because @xmath105 approximates the average distance of states along geodesics on the recurrence network graph ( which can be considered as the geometric backbone of the attractor ) in multiples of @xmath8 , while @xmath107 gives the mean distance of states in @xmath110 as measured by the norm @xmath111 .      by a similar argument as used in eq .",
    "( [ path_distance_inequality ] ) for the average path length , the diameter @xmath112 of the recurrence network ( i.e.  the maximum path length ) serves as an @xmath8-upper bound to the estimated diameter @xmath113 of the attractor in phase space : @xmath114      the inverse average shortest path length of vertex @xmath22 to all others in the recurrence network is measured by the closeness centrality @xcite @xmath115 if @xmath11 and @xmath82 are not connected , i.e. , @xmath79 , the maximum shortest path length in the graph , @xmath26 , is used in the sum by definition . in a recurrence network , @xmath116 can be geometrically interpreted as measuring the closeness of @xmath22 to all other states with respect to the average length ( in units of @xmath8 ) of geodesic connections on the recurrence network graph . in other words",
    ", @xmath116 is large if most of the other vertices are reachable in a small number of @xmath8-jumps from state to state .    from eqs .",
    "( [ path_distance_inequality ] ) and ( [ closeness_equation ] ) , we can see that the inverse closeness @xmath117 is bounded from below by the average phase space distance of vertex ( state ) @xmath22 to all other vertices ( states ) @xmath118 in units of @xmath8 ( geometrical closeness ) , as measured by the norm @xmath111 ,    @xmath119    put differently , geometrical closeness provides an upper bound for topological closeness ,    @xmath120      the betweenness centrality @xmath121 has been originally introduced for characterising the importance of individual vertices for the transport of information or matter in general complex networks @xcite . unlike the degree centrality @xmath23 , it is defined locally but depends on global adjacency information .",
    "let us assume that information travels through the network on shortest paths .",
    "there are @xmath122 shortest paths connecting two nodes @xmath11 and @xmath82 .",
    "we then regard a node @xmath22 to be an important mediator for the information transport in the network , if it is traversed by a large number of all existing shortest paths .",
    "betweenness centrality is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 gives the number of shortest paths from @xmath11 to @xmath82 , that include @xmath22 . here the contribution of shortest paths is weighted by their respective multiplicity @xmath122 , the physical rational for this normalisation being that the total volume of information flow between two vertices , when summed over all shortest paths connecting them , should be the same for all pairs in the network .",
    "hence , in addition to degree and closeness centralities , betweenness centrality yields another possibility to identify especially relevant vertices .    for a recurrence network , the notion of information transfer is not useful anymore .",
    "however , one may still argue in a geometric way that high betweenness states are typical for regions of sparse phase space density that separate different high - density clusters ( refering to the information flow analogy mentioned above , one may consider the corresponding vertices as _ geometric bottlenecks _ ) .",
    "thus , the occurrence of high betweenness values can be a sign of highly fractionated attractors ( on the scale resolved by the considered threshold @xmath8 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the corresponding implications for some simple model systems will be given in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "while betweenness centrality refers to vertex properties of a network , one may define an equivalent measure also based on the number of shortest paths on the network that include a specific edge @xmath75 .",
    "we refer to the corresponding property as the edge betweenness @xmath125 .",
    "note that though there is a conceptual difference between vertex - related and edge - related betweenness , both quantities are indicators for regions of low phase space density that separate regions with higher density ( or , to say it differently , of regions of high attractor fractionation ) and thus have practically the same dynamical meaning .",
    "in the following , we will show the potentials of the network - theoretic measures discussed in the previous section for recurrence networks obtained from three paradigmatic chaotic model systems .",
    "basic results for one - dimensional maps have already been described for the logistic map ( see @xcite ) based on numerical calculations and are supplemented by some further computations in the appendix . at this point",
    ", we prefer to discuss in some more detail the properties of systems that are defined in somewhat higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , we consider the hnon map @xmath126 as an example for a chaotic two - dimensional map , and the rssler system @xmath127 as well as the lorenz system @xmath128 as two examples for three - dimensional chaotic oscillators . in all following considerations",
    ", no additional embedding will be used .",
    "note , however , that for the continuous systems , temporal correlations between subsequent observations have been excluded by removing all sojourn points @xcite .",
    "[ p2p_henon ] and [ p2p_rossler ] show examples of typical trajectories of these three model systems .",
    "in addition , the shortest paths between the first and last point of the individual realisation are indicated , underlining the deep conceptual differences between the concepts of trajectory ( in phase space ) and path ( in a recurrence network , see section [ sec : recnet ] ) .    ) , indicated by circles . the initial condition is marked by a square the size of which corresponds to the neighbourhood threshold @xmath129 ( maximum norm ) considered in the derivation of the corresponding recurrence network .",
    "the shortest path ( with @xmath130 ) between the first and the last point is indicated by a continuous red line . ]",
    "let us first consider the dependence of the global network measures @xmath105 , @xmath58 and @xmath68 on the choice of the threshold @xmath8 for our three model systems .",
    "the variations of @xmath105 with the threshold @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ avg_path_all ] and verify the existence of an inverse relationship of a corresponding lower bound postulated in eq .",
    "( [ avgl_eq ] ) .     +   +     for the global clustering coefficient , the dependence on @xmath8 is more complicated and depends on the specific properties of the considered system ( fig .",
    "[ avg_path_all ] ) .",
    "in particular , while for too small @xmath8 , problems may occur , since the recurrence network may decompose into different disconnected clusters for a length @xmath131 of the considered time series , for intermediate threshold values , an approximately linear increase of @xmath58 with @xmath8 seems to be a common feature of all three examples .",
    "following the discussion of the behaviour of one - dimensional maps in [ app_1dmap ] , we may argue that this increase is most likely related to the effect of the attractor boundaries .",
    "finally , concerning the assortativity coefficient @xmath68 , we observe that for small @xmath8 , the recurrence networks are highly assortative ( e.g.  @xmath68 is close to 1 ) .",
    "this behaviour can be related to the fact that in case of small neighbourhoods , these phase space regions are usually characterised by only weak variations of the phase space density , so that neighbouring vertices have a tendency to obey a similar degree . as @xmath8 becomes larger , larger regions of the phase space",
    "are covered , where the density may vary much stronger , which implies that the degrees of neighbouring vertices become less similar .",
    "note , however , that since in this case , the mutual overlap of the different neighbourhoods becomes successively larger , there is still a significantly positive correlation between the degrees of neighbouring vertices .",
    "one may further observe that the decrease of @xmath68 with @xmath8 may be interrupted by intermediate increases , which are probably related to some preferred spatial scale of the separation of certain dynamically invariant objects such as unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) .",

    ", we will study the interrelationships between local network properties and structural features of the phase space for the three considered chaotic model systems .",
    "when considering the degree centrality @xmath23 or , equivalently , the local density @xmath132 for all vertices of the network , a broad range of variability is found ( fig .",
    "[ degree_all ] ) .",
    "in particular , the behaviour follows the expectation that regions with a high phase space density ( for example , the merger of the two scrolls of the lorenz oscillator ) also reveal a high density of vertices and , hence , high degree centralities .",
    "note that the calculation of a recurrence plot depends on the parameter @xmath8 , which should be tailored to the considered system under study and the specific questions one wishes to address .",
    "several `` rules of thumb '' for the choice of the threshold @xmath8 have been advocated in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the choice of @xmath8 to achieve a fixed recurrence rate @xmath37 is helpful for the estimation of dynamical invariants in many systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , this procedure will be adopted here to obtain an overall visualisation of the degree centrality @xmath23 in phase space , with @xmath133 ( which lies within the typical scaling region of the correlation integral ) . however , as we will see later , for the local clustering coefficients ( sec .",
    "[ cluster_spatial ] ) disclosing local fine structures of the phase space density , it is necessary to choose smaller @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ closeness_all ] reflects the spatial distribution of the closeness centrality @xmath116 . in good agreement with our previous theoretical considerations on the geometric meaning of this measure ( sec .",
    "[ closeness ] ) , we find high values of @xmath116 near the centre of gravity of the attractor in phase space , and low values at phase space regions that have large distances from this centre .",
    "( eq .  ( [ closeness_equation ] ) ) in phase space ( a ) hnon map , ( b ) rssler , and ( c ) lorenz systems ( @xmath131 and @xmath8 as in fig .  [ degree_all ] ) . ]      concerning the local clustering coefficient",
    ", one may suppose that in the case of high - density regions in phase space , there are many vertices located in the vicinity of a specific vertex , in particular , in a distance that does not exceed @xmath134 . by definition",
    ", these vertices must then also be adjacent to each other , which gives considerable contributions to the clustering coefficient .",
    "in contrast , for low - density regions , one may argue that even if there are more than one vertices in some @xmath8-neighbourhood of a vertex ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) , it is less likely that these are also separated by a distance that is smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "following these considerations , one might expect some relationship between the degree centrality and the local clustering coefficient .",
    "however , as figs .",
    "[ kvcv_all ] ,  [ cc_henon ] , and [ cc_ros ] demonstrate , @xmath47 does clearly reveal more and different structural properties than the degree centrality alone ( note that here , a smaller value of @xmath8 has been chosen to disclose the local fine structures of the phase space density ) .",
    "in particular , a visual comparison with fig .",
    "[ degree_all ] reveals that the clustering coefficient characterises some specific higher - order characteristics of the phase space density .     and the local clustering coefficient @xmath47 for typical realisations of ( a ) hnon map , ( b ) rssler , and ( c ) lorenz system . the inserted values @xmath136 give the corresponding rank - order correlation coefficient ( spearman s rho ) .",
    "]            beside the effect of the local phase space density , we argue that the local clustering coefficient does also depend on the spatial filling ( i.e. , the homogeneity of the phase space density ) in the neighbourhood of the considered point . in particular , in the case of a two - dimensional system , an alignment of vertices along a one - dimensional subspace will produce a clearly lower clustering coefficient than a homogeneous filling of the neighbourhood .",
    "this behaviour is underlined in fig .",
    "[ cc_henon ] for the hnon map , where maximum values of @xmath137 can be particularly found at the two tips of the attractor .",
    "hence , the local clustering coefficient can be considered as an entropy - like characteristic in that it quantifies the homogeneity of the phase space density in the neighbourhood of a vertex . from the theory of spatial random graphs @xcite , which may be assumed to yield the lowest possible clustering coefficients among all spatial networks ,",
    "it is known that for a given dimension @xmath2 of the considered system , in the asymptotic limit @xmath59 and @xmath138 , the possible values of @xmath47 are bound between the corresponding theoretical value and @xmath52 .",
    "note that this lower bound systematically decreases with increasing @xmath2 , which appears to be reasonable if one interpretes @xmath47 as an entropy - like quantity . to be more specific , according to dall and christensen @xcite , this decay follows an exponential function for sufficiently large embedding dimensions .",
    "the presence of distinct structures in the spatial profile of the local clustering coefficient is related to the emergence of specific dynamically invariant objects in the considered model systems . in the case of hnon map ( fig .",
    "[ cc_henon ] ) , there is a clear tendency that points that are close to the stable manifold associated with the system have remarkably higher values of @xmath47 .",
    "note , however , that because of finite size effects , this coincidence can not be found for all corresponding regions of the phase space .",
    "for the two continuous systems ( fig .",
    "[ cc_ros ] ) , points close to the trapping regimes of upos have higher clustering coefficients .",
    "it is , in some sense , trivial to understand the role of upos in forming such regimes of higher clustering .",
    "whenever the trajectory of the corresponding systems visits the neighbourhood of an upo , it is captured in this neighbourhood for a certain finite time , during which the probability of recurrences is increased . furthermore , once the trajectory is trapped , the local divergence rate becomes smaller .",
    "this smaller local divergence rate is captured by the clustering coefficient ( in terms of higher - order correlations between neighbours of a vertex ) .",
    "as for the finite-@xmath8 effect in the hnon map , the regions with increased clustering coefficients in most cases only coincide with upos of lower periods . therefore , in fig .  [ cc_ros ] , only a few upos of low order are shown for comparison .",
    "note that if two upos are separated by a distance smaller than @xmath8 in phase space , the clustering coefficient is not able to distinguish between these two structures and , hence , shows a broad band with increased values . following this argumentation",
    ", @xmath47 is a useful measure for detecting phase space regions with a high density of low - order upos , which is in good agreement with corresponding considerations in @xcite .",
    "our interpretation of the betweenness centrality in sec .",
    "[ sec : bc ] implies that @xmath121 is a rather sensitive measure of the local fragmentation of the attractor and thus may give complementary information especially on very small scales .",
    "unfortunately , numerical limitations in the calculation of this measure did not allow us to explore the limit of small neighbourhoods ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "however , from our computations with somewhat larger thresholds ( see fig .  [ bc_ros ] ) , we can already derive some general statements about the behaviour of betweenness centrality for the considered model systems .",
    "first , note that regions close to the outer boundaries of the attractor ( in contrast to those in the vicinity of the inner boundaries , e.g. , of the rssler oscillator ) are not important for many shortest path connections on the recurrence network .",
    "hence , vertices settled in the corresponding parts of the phase space are characterised by low betweenness values .",
    "second , if there are pronounced regions with rather few isolated points in between high - density regions ( for example , between two upos in the rssler or lorenz systems ) , there is an increasing number of shortest paths crossing these vertices , which leads to higher values of @xmath121 . in turn , vertices in the vicinity of upos ( i.e. , high - density regions ) show lower betweenness values .",
    "therefore , betweenness centrality provides a complementary view on the attractor geometry in comparison to the local clustering coefficient @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ cc_ros ] ) .          similarly to the local vertex properties",
    ", one may also study the characteristics of different edges in the recurrence networks . since the resulting structures are more pronounced than for the three model systems considered so far , fig .",
    "[ mi_eb ] shows the matching index and edge betweenness for one realisation of the logistic map @xmath139 in the intermittent chaotic regime ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of intermittent dynamics can be clearly seen from the recurrence plots in terms of extended square recurrence patterns , which hence lead to mutually connected vertices of the associated recurrence networks that correspond to subsequent points in time .",
    "figures  [ mi_eb ] and [ mi_dist ] show the complex dependence between phase space distance @xmath78 , matching index @xmath77 , and edge betweenness @xmath125 .",
    "for the matching index , the results are consistent with our theoretical considerations presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : mi ] .",
    "in particular , for @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 , while for @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "concerning the temporal evolution during the laminar ( intermittent ) phase , one may recognise that at the beginning , there is hardly any change in the state of the system , hence , @xmath78 is very small for subsequent points in time ( vertices of the recurrence network ) , which relates to large values of the matching index near @xmath52 .",
    "as the laminar phases are close to their termination , chaotic variations emerge and rise in amplitude , which leads to a subsequent increase of @xmath78 and , hence , decrease of @xmath77 .",
    "concerning the edge betweenness @xmath125 ( the spatial pattern of which is very similar to that of the vertex - based betweenness centrality @xmath121 due to the spatial proximity of edge and corresponding vertices ) , the overall behaviour is opposite to that of @xmath77 . during laminar phases",
    ", we find that since all states are very close to each other , possible shortest connections may alternatively pass through a variety of different edges , leading to low values of the edge betweenness .",
    "close to the termination , there is in turn an increase of this measure .",
    "however , the most interesting feature of the edge betweenness is presented by isolated edges with very high values of @xmath125 , which correspond to rarely visited phase space regions between intervals of higher phase space density .",
    "more specifically , the average edge betweenness of vertices in such low - density regions may exceed that of high - density regions by orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ mi_eb ] ) .",
    "this paper has reconsidered the analysis of time series from complex systems by means of complex network theory .",
    "we have argued that most existing approaches for such an analysis suffer from certain methodological limitations or a lack of generality in their applicability . as an appealing solution ,",
    "we have suggested recurrence networks as a unifying framework for studying time series as complex networks , which is based on the idea of recurrence plots . as we have argued ,",
    "this specific approach is applicable to univariate as well as multivariate time series without or with embedding .",
    "in addition , recurrence networks can be applied for studying time series with non - equidistant time - scales and allow the construction of simple significance tests with respect to the associated network - theoretic measures @xcite .    as a main achievement ,",
    "we have provided a thorough reinterpretation of a variety of statistical measures from network theory computed for recurrence networks in terms of phase space properties of dynamical systems . since all time ordering information",
    "is lost in this approach , all complex network characteristics are dynamically invariant , i.e. , they are only sensitive to certain properties of the invariant density of the considered dynamical system . from this invariance , it follows that specific measures such as the local clustering coefficient may be used for detecting dynamically invariant objects like unstable periodic orbits or chaotic saddles . on the other hand",
    ", this feature also implies that the proposed method can not be used to distinguish between deterministic ( chaotic ) and stochastic systems , which is exemplified by our comparison between bernoulli map and uniform noise in [ app_1dmap ] . as a possibility to overcome this potential point of criticism to our method , we emphasise that an additional embedding should change the properties of deterministic systems in a different way than for a stochastic system , hence , studying complex network properties in dependence on the embedding dimension might help solving this interpretation problem .",
    "we will further elaborate this idea in future research .",
    "using wide - spread statistical characteristics of complex networks such as the `` trinity '' of centrality measures ( degree , closeness , betweenness ) and the clustering coefficient , we were able to provide a detailed interpretation of the corresponding results for recurrence networks in terms of higher - order phase space properties .",
    "in particular , degree centrality relates to the local density , closeness centrality to the average geometrical proximity of an observation to all other observations , and betweenness centrality to the local fragmentation of points in phase space . for the clustering coefficient",
    ", the consideration of different model systems has revealed that apart from possible density effects , the clustering properties are related to the spatial filling of the phase space , which become important close to the attractor boundaries and certain dynamically invariant objects such as invariant manifolds or unstable periodic orbits .",
    "additionally , we have presented a rigorous analytical treatment of the local and global clustering coefficients of the recurrence networks of one - dimensional chaotic maps , which perfectly matches our numerical results ( see [ app_1dmap ] ) . a possible further relationship between the local clustering coefficient of a recurrence network and the local lyapunov exponent of the underlying dynamical system",
    "remains a topic for future work .    with respect to existing recurrence plot based methods of time series analysis , e.g. , recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa )",
    ", we would like to emphasise that our approach yields a complementary view on the phase space properties of the underlying dynamical system .",
    "in particular , one should note that nearly all of the considered network - theoretical measures have no direct equivalents in traditional rqa and vice versa .",
    "hence , one may think of situations when either one of the two frameworks ( i.e. , rqa or recurrence networks ) may provide better results than the other . in turn",
    ", there have been some recent approaches on applying methods of time series analysis to general complex networks ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to underline that due to the duality between the recurrence matrix of a time series and the adjacency matrix of the associated recurrence network , rqa might be another promising candidate for this purpose ( as long as one restricts oneself to measures that are invariant under re - ordering of time ) , which might yield interesting complementary insights on complex networks in a variety of different situations",

    "<S> this paper presents a new approach for analysing structural properties of time series from complex systems . starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space </S>",
    "<S> , the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points in time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar . </S>",
    "<S> a critical comparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is presented , revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other methods as special cases .    </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the topological properties of recurrence networks and the statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the network description yields new quantitative characteristics of the dynamical complexity of a time series , which substantially complement existing measures of recurrence quantification analysis . </S>"
