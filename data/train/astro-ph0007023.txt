    "weak lensing provides a unique method to directly measure the mass fluctuations on large scales in the universe ( see mellier 1999 ; kaiser 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 1999 for recent reviews ) .",
    "this method relies on the measurement of small , coherent distortions produced by lensing upon the shapes of background galaxies .",
    "this effect is now routinely used to map the mass of clusters of galaxies ( see reviews by fort & mellier 1994 , schneider 1996 ) .",
    "recently , the technique was extended to the field by several groups who reported the statistical detection of weak lensing by large - scale structure ( wittman et al .",
    "2000 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 ; bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ( bre ) ; kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000 ) .",
    "more precise measurements of this `` cosmic shear '' from upcoming observations will provide invaluable cosmological information ( eg .",
    "kaiser 1992 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; kamionkowski et al . 1997 ; kaiser 1998 ; hu & tegmark 1998 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "because the distortions induced by lensing are only of the order of 1% , these measurements are very challenging . in particular , they require tight control of systematic effects and a precise method for the measurement of the shear .",
    "one of the potential weaknesses of the cosmic shear programme is the step leading from the measurement of the shapes of galaxies to the estimation of the lensing shear , in the presence of an anisotropic psf .",
    "the first method proposed to treat this problem was that by bonnet & mellier ( 1995 ) .",
    "a more general , and now widely used , method was proposed by kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( 1995 , ksb ) and further developed by luppino & kaiser ( 1997 ) and hoekstra et al .",
    "variations and alternatives to the ksb method have since been presented by kaiser ( 1999b ) , rhodes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kuijken ( 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we address the ellipticity - to - shear problem using numerical simulations of artificial images .",
    "the numerical simulations which have been used for this purpose in the past have been derived either from hst images , degraded to match ground - based observations ( eg .",
    "ksb , wittman et al .",
    "2000 ) , or by using ab - initio artificial galaxy catalogs ( eg .",
    "kaiser 1999b ) .",
    "the former approach provides accurate shape statistics for the simulated galaxies , but can only produce a small simulated area .",
    "the latter approach allows the simulation of arbitrarily large areas , but is not necessarily as realistic .",
    "because we are aiming at the demanding cosmic shear regime , we thus use a hybrid method in which large realisations of artificial galaxy images are drawn to reproduce the statistics of existing hst surveys .    because it is widely used and more documented , we focus on the ksb method , and",
    "test its reliability in realistic observational conditions .",
    "for definitiveness , we consider the weak - lensing survey of bre , who used ground based observations with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "we produce artificial galaxy catalogs generated from random realisations based on the hst groth strip ( groth et al .",
    "1994 , rhodes 1999 ) . by applying artificial shears to the simulated images , we test both the systematic and statistical uncertainties of the method .",
    "we also investigate how the shear signal degrades as a function of seeing , exposure time and pixel size .",
    "this is of considerable practical interest for the design of future weak lensing surveys .",
    "in addition , we examine the impact of overlapping isophotes on the shear signal , an effect which can potentially limit weak lensing measurements on small scales .",
    "an independent study of the shear measurement method using numerical simulations is presented in erben et al .",
    "( 2000 )    the paper is organised as follows . in  [ cat ] , we describe how we generate the artificial galaxy and star catalogues . in ",
    "[ i m ] , we show how these are used to produced realistic images , which are compared to observed wht images .",
    "this is followed in  [ ksb ]",
    "be a brief description of our implementation of the ksb method . in  [ results ] , we present our results ; the accuracy of recovery of shear with the ksb method is discussed , and the occurrence of an anti - correlation of shear with star ellipticity at low level is noted .",
    "we demonstrate the degradation of signal - to - noise with increasing seeing , exposure time and pixel size , and also discuss the level at which overlapping isophotes will enhance the cosmological shear signal .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the first step in these simulations is to construct an object catalogue .",
    "to do so , we used the image statistics from the groth strip , a deep survey taken with the hubble space telescope ( groth et al .",
    "1994 , rhodes et al 1999 ) .",
    "this hst survey is sampled at 0.1 arcsec and thus effectively gives us the unsmeared ( i.e. before convolution with ground - level seeing ) ellipticities and diameters of an ensemble of galaxies suitable for simulations of ground - based observations .",
    "the survey consists of a set of 28 contiguous pointings in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with an area of approx .",
    "108 arcmin@xmath2 in a 3.5 @xmath3 44.0 region .",
    "the magnitude limit is @xmath4 ( wfpc2 i band , f814w ) , and the strip includes about 10,000 galaxies .",
    "we use a sextractor ( bertin & arnoults 1996 ) catalogue derived from the entire strip by ebbels ( 1998 ) .",
    "it contains , for each object , a magnitude determined by aperture photometry , and a diameter and ellipticity derived from second - order moments using a top - hat weight function .",
    "armed with this catalogue , we model the multi - dimensional probability distribution of galaxy properties ( ellipticity - magnitude - diameter ) sampled by this catalogue .",
    "we find that the differential galaxy counts as a function of @xmath1-magnitude are well described by @xmath5 galaxies deg@xmath6 mag@xmath7 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9=1.64 and @xmath10 ; the radius distribution is modelled as @xmath11 arcsecs with @xmath12 and with @xmath13 a gaussian distribution with mean 3.75 and rms 0.098 .",
    "ellipticity components @xmath14 and @xmath15 are described by gaussian probability distributions of rms 0.34 , and the position angle is randomly chosen .",
    "we draw from this modeled distribution a catalogue of galaxies statistically identical to the groth strip distribution by monte carlo selection .    for definiteness",
    ", we aim to reproduce the conditions of our weak lensing survey derived from observations with wht ( see bre ) .",
    "this survey consisted of 14 independent blank fields observed the wht prime focus ccd camera ( field of view 8 @xmath3 16 , pixel size 0.237  , eev ccd ) in the @xmath16 band .",
    "a relevant issue is the number of stars obtained : by tuning the galactic latitude ( @xmath17 ) , we required the fields to contain @xmath18 stars with @xmath19 in order to map carefully the psf and the camera distortion across the field of view .",
    "the integration time on these fields was 1 hour , affording a magnitude limit of @xmath16=25.2 ( all @xmath16 magnitudes quoted as vega magnitudes ) .",
    "given that the groth strip is in @xmath1 while our data is in @xmath16 , we allowed a slight increase ( multiplication by 1.2 ) to radius with magnitude to better model the wht images ; this factor has been included in the described model above .",
    "the number density - magnitude dependence was found to fit very well without alteration .",
    "we spatially distribute the galaxies with a uniform probability across the field of view .",
    "since the groth strip does not contain enough stars to create a good model , star counts with @xmath16-magnitude are modeled as a power law ( @xmath20 ) which is found to be a good fit to the wht data .",
    "we assign a morphological class ( elliptical , spiral or irregular ) for future image realisation to each galaxy using the results of abraham et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "specifically , we use their measured fraction for each class as a function of magnitude .",
    "after application of all of the above procedure , we obtain our unlensed object catalogues .    to produce the lensed object catalogue , we sheared the galaxies in the catalogue by calculating the change in the object ellipticity due to lensing .",
    "this was done using the relation ( rhodes et al 1999 ) : @xmath21 since we are primarily interested only in the mean shear measured on the field , we chose the imposed shear to be uniform over a given field .",
    "stellar ellipticities ( simulating tracking errors , atmospheric effects , etc ) are similarly chosen as uniform over a given field .",
    "the ellipticity for each field is taken from a gaussian probability distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath22 .",
    "this is conservatively chosen to be slightly worse than the rms stellar ellipticity of the stars in our wht survey , for which @xmath23 .",
    "we create the artificial images using the iraf artdata package .",
    "this takes the star and galaxy catalogues , and plots the objects with specified positions , ellipticity , magnitude , diameter and morphology .",
    "only exponential discs and de vaucouleurs profiles are supported .",
    "we model ellipticals and irregulars as de vaucouleurs profiles , and spirals as exponential discs .",
    "each pixel in these simulations is subdivided into a @xmath24 grid of subpixels .",
    "the appropriate subpixel flux for a star or galaxy is calculated from the analytical intensity profile , and the psf convolution is similarly performed at the subpixel level .",
    "we use the package to recreate several wht - specific details : the magnitude zero point is chosen to match the telescope throughput , the stars and galaxies are convolved with the chosen elliptical psf ( seeing chosen to be 0.8  unless otherwise specified , ellipticity dispersion 0.08 ) , the image is appropriately pixellised ( 0.237  per pixel ) , poisson photon noise for objects and sky background are included , and gaussian ccd read noise ( 3.9 electrons ) are added . the appropriate gain ( 1.45 electrons / adu )",
    "is included , and an appropriate sky background ( 10.7adu per sec ) is imposed . the psf profile chosen is the moffat profile , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 = 2.5 and @xmath27 is the seeing radius .",
    "the generalised radius @xmath28 is the distance from the centroid , transformed so that the profile is elliptical .",
    "this profile has wings which fall off more slowly than for a gaussian profile , and provides a good description of our seeing - dominated psf .",
    "an example 4 @xmath3 4 portion of a @xmath29 simulated field is shown in figure [ fig : simimage ] .",
    "it can be compared to an observed wht image shown in figure [ fig : cirsi2 ] .",
    "a global impression can be obtained from the full @xmath29 fields plotted in bre .",
    "the simulated image lacks saturated stars ( @xmath30 ) ; these are , by construction absent from the simulated catalogue ( see size - magnitude figure in bre ) , since such stars can not be used in our weak lensing analysis , and would be immediately excised if present .",
    "the galaxy images appear to be very similar in the simulations as compared with the data .    to compare these images quantitatively , we derived a measured object catalog using the imcat routines ( see  [ ksb ] below for details ) .",
    "they provide the position , magnitude , half - light radius , ellipticity and polarisability tensors for each object detected on the image .    the resulting distribution on the radius - magnitude plane is shown in section 7 of bre for both a simulated field and the observed wht field ; the running mean and standard deviation of @xmath31 with magnitude is shown on figure [ fig : magrg ] .",
    "the distributions are similar , with mean radius agreeing to within 0.2 pixels throughout the magnitude range .",
    "the rms scatter in radius is somewhat larger at faint magnitudes for the real data , due to the response of the measurement software to the simple smooth profiles used in the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : n ] compares differential number counts with @xmath16-magnitude for the simulations and real data .",
    "the counts derived from the simulated image and from our real @xmath16-band fields agree very well ; the simulated image counts also agree well with the simulated catalogue counts , with an unsurprising turn - over near the expected magnitude completeness limit for the 1 hour exposure time ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the simulations close impersonation of real data number counts is of importance for obtaining realistic results for , eg , overlapping isophotes in section [ results ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : e]a shows the ellipticity ( @xmath33 ) distributions @xmath34 for the _ initial _ simulated catalogue , and the _ smeared _ simulated and real objects .",
    "the distributions were normalised so that @xmath35",
    ". as expected , smearing reduces the ellipticity dispersion .",
    "the simulated and real smeared distributions are remarkably similar .",
    "see section [ results ] for further discussion on this point .",
    "our shear measurement method is a version of the ksb method and was described in detail in bre . here",
    "we summarize it and then describe the relevant details of our specific implementation .",
    "the ksb method derives the shear from the ellipticity of galaxies , after correcting for the smearing by the psf .",
    "we use the implementation of the ksb method achieved by the imcat software kindly provided to us by nick kaiser .",
    "the routine hfindpeaks first finds objects in each field by convolving the image with smoothing kernels of different sizes .",
    "the object radius @xmath36 is defined by the size of the kernel which maximizes the signal - to - noise @xmath37 of the object .",
    "the routine getshapes then takes @xmath36 as the size of the gaussian weight function used to measure quadrupole moments @xmath38 of the object about its center of light .",
    "the ellipticity of the object is then defined as @xmath39 .",
    "the next step in the ksb algorithm is to correct for the anisotropy of the psf .",
    "the corrected ellipticity of a galaxy @xmath40 is related to the observed smeared ellipticity @xmath41 by @xmath42 where the ellipticities are understood to denote the relevant 2-component spinor @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a measure of psf anisotropy .",
    "the tensor @xmath45 is the smear polarisability , a @xmath46 matrix with components involving higher moments of surface brightness . since for stars",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath44 can be measured using @xmath48    the lensing shear takes effect before the circular smearing of the psf .",
    "luppino and kaiser ( 1997 ) showed that the _ pre_-smear shear @xmath49 averaged over a field can be recovered using @xmath50 where @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the shear polarisability tensor for the galaxy involving other higher order moments of the galaxy image . the quantities",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the shear and smear polarisabilities calculated for a star interpolated to the position of the galaxy in question . with the smear and shear polarisabilities calculated by imcat",
    ", we can therefore find an estimator for the mean shear in a given cell .",
    "firstly , we need to remove noisy detections .",
    "we applied a size limit @xmath55 to reject extraneous detections of very small objects claimed by imcat .",
    "we also applied a signal - to - noise @xmath56 limit ( see  [ ani_test ] for justification of this apparently very conservative cut ) . to reduce the noise in our measurement",
    ", we also remove highly elliptical objects with @xmath57 .",
    "stars were identified using the non - saturated stellar locus on the magnitude@xmath58 plane ( see figure 11 in bre ) , typically with @xmath59 19 - 22 . in the data ,",
    "the stellar ellipticity is a smooth function of position on the field .",
    "we thus adopted an iterative interpolation scheme to model this variation .",
    "specifically , we first fitted a 2-d cubic to the measured stellar ellipticities , plotted the residual ellipticities @xmath60 and re - fitted after the removal of extreme outliers ( caused by galaxy contamination , blended images and noise ) . the stellar ellipticity was kept constant in the simulations , but we nevertheless fit the 2-d cubic for correction , as a means of retaining potential systematic effects induced in this step .    in order to correct galaxies for anisotropic smear , we not only need the fitted stellar ellipticity field , but also the four component stellar smear and shear polarisabilities as a function of position . here",
    "a 2-d cubic is fit for each component of @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "galaxies are then chosen from the magnitude-@xmath58 diagram by removing the stellar locus and objects with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , as described above . from our fitted stellar models",
    ", we then calculate @xmath64 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 at each galaxy position , and correct the galaxies for the anisotropic psf using equation ( [ eq : ecorrect ] ) . as a result , we obtain @xmath65 for all selected galaxies in each cell .",
    "we then calculate @xmath66 for the galaxies .",
    "we opt to treat @xmath53 and @xmath54 as scalars equal to half the trace of the respective matrices .",
    "this is allowable , since the non - diagonal elements are small and the diagonal elements are equal within the measurement noise ( typical @xmath67 = 0.10 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 = 1.1 , @xmath70 ) .    with this simplification ,",
    "we calculate @xmath66 according to equation  ( [ eq : p_gamma ] ) .",
    "@xmath66 is typically a noisy quantity , so we fit it as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "we choose to treat @xmath66 as a scalar , since the information it carries is primarily a correction for the size of a given galaxy , regardless of its ellipticity or orientation .",
    "we thus plot @xmath71 and @xmath72 together against @xmath31 , and fit a cubic to the combined points .",
    "moreover , since @xmath66 is unreliable for objects with @xmath31 measured to be less that @xmath73 , we remove all such objects from our prospective galaxy catalogue . finally , we calculate a shear measure for each galaxy as in equation  ( [ eq : gamma_est ] ) , where the @xmath66 is the fitted value for the galaxy in question .    because of pixel noise , a few galaxies yield extreme , unphysical , shears @xmath49 . to prevent these from unnecessarily dominating the analysis ,",
    "we have removed galaxies with @xmath74 .",
    "this entire procedure provides us with an estimator of the shear @xmath49 for each galaxy .",
    "we can also calculate the mean shear @xmath75 in a cell and its associated error @xmath76=\\sigma[\\gamma]/\\sqrt{n}$ ] , where @xmath77 is the number of galaxies in a cell .",
    "we first compare the distribution of ellipticities and shear estimators within a field . as we noted above",
    ", the uncorrected ellipticity distribution of the simulated objects is very similar to that of the data ( figure  [ fig : e]a ) .",
    "the distribution of the shear estimators @xmath78 after all corrections is shown on figure  [ fig : e]b , for each case .",
    "the agreement is good , showing that the simulations faithfully reproduce the shape statistics of the data , the central concern for weak lensing",
    ".    in general , the variance of the shear estimators results from several effects : the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion , pixelisation , and pixel noise .",
    "the latter effect is enhanced by the correction for the isotropic smearing .",
    "the ellipiticity and shear rms dispersion , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , at different stages of the correction algorithm are listed in table  [ tab : variance ] . the ellipticity dispersion observed in the simulated image",
    "is reduced by the psf smearing as compared to the input ellipticity dispersion .",
    "( pixel noise and pixelisation tends to increase the observed dispersion , but the smearing dominates ) .",
    "the smearing is corrected for by the ksb method , leading to a re - increased dispersion @xmath81 in the corrected shear estimator .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      spurious lensing signals could also be produced on small scales by overlapping isophotes of neighboring galaxies .",
    "van waerbeke et al . ( 2000 ) suggested that this effect could explain the excess small scale power observed in their cosmic shear surveys . to understand this effect ,",
    "consider two galaxies which , for simplicity , are assumed to be circular . if the galaxies are separated by an angular distance comparable to their angular sizes , their combined isophotes will have a dumb - bell shape rather than be the simple sum of two disjoint circular isophotes . as a result",
    ", their ellipticity will tend to be aligned along the separation axis , leading to a spurious ellipticity correlation .    to test the impact of this effect",
    ", we performed 10 simulations without lensing shear ( with seeing 0.8  and exposure time of 1 hour ) .",
    "for these simulations , we measured the shear correlation functions defined as ( eg .",
    "kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 run from 1 to 2 . here ,",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 are the shear estimates of each member of a galaxy pair with a separation @xmath87 .",
    "these ellipticities are measured in a coordinate system whose x - axis is along the separation angle of the galaxy pair ( see heavens , refregier & heymans ( 2000 ) for an illustration ) . after measuring these correlation functions for each of the 10 simulations separately , we computed the mean and error in the mean over all simulations .",
    "the resulting correlation functions are shown on figure [ fig : cfn ] . as a comparison ,",
    "the correlation function expected from lensing for a cluster - normalised @xmath88 model is also shown ( see ibid for details of the calculation ) . in the null simulation",
    ", we weakly detect a correlation on scales smaller than about 1. the amplitude of the overlapping isophote effect is @xmath89 corresponding to an rms shear of about 1% . as can be seen on the figure , this is smaller , but comparable to the lensing signal expected on these scales .",
    "the exact amplitude of the overlapping isophote effect will depend on the precise conditions of the observation ( or simulation ) .",
    "it is nevertheless likely that the excess power observed by van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on small scales ( @xmath90 ) is indeed due to this effect .",
    "apart from residual systematic effects , another explanation for this excess power could be the intrinsic alignment of galaxies .",
    "theoretical studies however indicate that this effect is small for a survey of this depth ( heavens , refregier & heymans 2000 ; metzler & croft 2000 ; see also catelan , kamionkowski & blandford 2000 , and pen , lee & seljak 2000 ) .",
    "we have tested our shear measurement method using numerical simulations of artificial images .",
    "the object catalogues were created by generating realisations of the hst groth strip ; the resulting artificial images include observational effects such as noise , seeing , and anisotropic psf .",
    "we compare our realised catalogues to those observed with wht and find good statistical agreement .",
    "we used these simulations to test the ksb shear measurement method .",
    "overall , we find that this method is rather accurate , but with several provisos : we find a residual anti - correlation between the psf ellipticity and the corrected ellipticities of faint galaxies .",
    "this effect can be made negligible if faint galaxies ( with @xmath91 ) are removed from the catalogue .",
    "we also find that the recovered shear is linearly related to the input shear , but with a coefficient of about 0.8 which must be used to calibrate the final shear . with these precautions ,",
    "the ksb method is sufficient for the current weak lensing surveys .",
    "however , the method is neither optimal nor necessarily extendable to superior observing conditions . it should therefore be replaced with more accurate methods such as that of kaiser ( 1999b ) , rhodes , refregier & groth ( 2000 ) , and kuijken ( 1999 ) , in future , more sensitive surveys .",
    "we also used our simulations to study the effect of seeing , exposure time and pixelisation on the sensitivity to the shear .",
    "we found that increased seeing fwhm increases the noise almost linearly , with the primary loss being the decreased number of usable galaxies . in the seeing - dominated regime ,",
    "the sensitivity to shear is only weakly dependent on exposure time .",
    "as long as this regime holds , it is therefore more efficient to tend towards wide rather than deep weak lensing surveys .",
    "increased pixel scale hardly affects the sensitivity until the pixel scale is comparable to the seeing fwhm , at which point the method fails for typical ground - based seeing .",
    "thus , extreme oversampling of the psf does not seem to be necessary .",
    "we also tested the claim by van waerbeke et al .",
    "that spurious shear signals on small scales ( @xmath90 ) could be produced by overlapping isophotes of neighboring galaxies . using simulated images without input shear",
    ", we weakly detect this effect on scales @xmath92 .",
    "the rms amplitude of this effect is of about 1% , which is smaller but comparable to that expected for lensing .",
    "overlapping isophotes are thus likely to explain the excess power found on small scale by this group .",

    "<S> weak gravitational lensing induces distortions on the images of background galaxies , and thus provides a direct measure of mass fluctuations in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion signature from large - scale structure has recently been detected by several groups for the first time , opening promising prospects for the near future . since the distortions induced by lensing on the images of background galaxies are only of a few percent , a reliable measurement demands very accurate galaxy shape estimation and a careful treatment of systematic effects . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a study of a shear measurement method using detailed simulations of artificial images . </S>",
    "<S> the images are produced using realisations of a galaxy ensemble drawn from the hst groth strip . </S>",
    "<S> we consider realistic observational effects including atmospheric seeing , psf anisotropy and pixelisation , incorporated in a manner to reproduce actual observations with the william herschel telescope . by applying an artificial shear to the simulated images , we test the shear measurement method proposed by kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( 1995 , ksb ) . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find the ksb method to be reliable with the following provisos . </S>",
    "<S> first , although the recovered shear is linearly related to the input shear , we find a coefficient of proportionality of about 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a residual anti - correlation between the psf ellipticity and the corrected ellipticities of faint galaxies . to guide future weak lensing surveys , </S>",
    "<S> we study how seeing size , exposure time and pixelisation affect the sensitivity to shear . </S>",
    "<S> we find that worsened seeing linearly increases the noise in the shear estimate , while the sensitivity depends only weakly on exposure time </S>",
    "<S> . the noise is dramatically increased if the pixel scale is larger than that of the seeing . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we study the impact of overlapping isophotes of neighboring galaxies , and find that this effect can produce spurious lensing signals on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the prospects of using the ksb method for future , more sensitive , surveys . </S>",
