    "gene expression_. the stochastic characterisation of the gene expression in the protein production process has been theoretically studied by means of stochastic models in the late 70s by berg  @xcite and rigney  @xcite and reviewed recently by paulsson  @xcite . for a long period of time , it has not been possible to compare the theoretical results to real data , because of the lack of appropriate laboratory techniques . in the last two decades , the introduction of reliable expression reporter techniques and the use of fluorescent reporters , as the gfp ( green fluorescent protein ) , has allowed observations in live cells and the experimental quantification of the protein production at single cell level .",
    "see taniguchi et al .",
    "@xcite for the experimental characterization of a large number of messengers and proteins of e. coli .",
    "the good qualitative agreement observed between experiments and the predictions of these earlier stochastic models have stimulated further investigations to take into account the statistical characteristics of the phenomena involved in the protein production process . in this domain ,",
    "the variance of the number of the cellular components in the cell is a key indicator of the efficiency of a production strategy , since it gives a measure of the fluctuation of resources of the cell consumed by the production process .",
    "clearly enough , this characteristic is directly affected by model design and statistical assumptions .    as in the previous works ,",
    "see paulsson  @xcite and swain  @xcite , it is especially important to derive explicit analytical formulas for the variance to assess the impact of the key parameters and , consequently , to get a biological interpretation of the obtained results .",
    "as it will be seen , the introduction of more realistic statistical assumptions leads to several technical difficulties , the main one being that the classic pde approach ( fokker - planck equations ) used in the literature can no longer be used . in the present paper , using an approach based on marked poisson point processes , we relax some statistical assumptions of the earlier stochastic models and obtain general results for a large class of stochastic models . in the biological context , we are then able to derive closed form expressions of the mean and variance of the main characteristics of the production process .      we first provide few biological insights about the protein production in living organisms .",
    "the _ gene expression _ is the process by which the genetic information is synthesised into a functional product , the proteins .",
    "the production of proteins is the most important cellular activity , both for the functional role and the high associated cost in terms of resources ( in prokaryotic cells it can reach up to @xmath0% of the cellular resources ) . in particular , in a _",
    "e. coli _ bacterium there are about @xmath1 proteins of approximately @xmath2 different types with a large variability in concentration , depending on their types : from a few dozen up to @xmath3 .    the information flow from dna genes to proteins is a fundamental process , common to all living organisms and is composed of two main elementary processes : _ transcription _ and _ translation_. during the transcription process , the _ rna polymerase _ binds to an active gene relative to a specific protein and makes a complementary copy of a specific dna sequence , a _ messenger rna _ ( mrna ) .",
    "each mrna , which is a long chain of nucleotides , is a chemical `` blueprint '' for a particular protein .",
    "the translation of the messenger into a polypeptide chain is achieved by a large complex molecule : the _ ribosome _ with the help of some accessory factors like the elongation factor to cite a few . during translation",
    ", the ribosome binds to the messenger and builds the polypeptide chain using mrna as a template .",
    "more in detail , to each mrna _ codon _ , a triplet of nucleotides , corresponds a specific amino acid , which is the fundamental component of proteins .",
    "the polypeptide chain of amino acids , folds spontaneously or with the help of _ chaperons _ , into its functional three - dimensional structure .",
    "the gene expression is a highly stochastic process and results from the realization of a very large number of elementary stochastic processes of different nature .",
    "the thermal excitation affects many processes , since it implies for example the free diffusion in the cytoplasm in which particles behave basically as if they were plunged into a viscous fluid . in first approximation ,",
    "three fundamental mechanisms are combined in the protein production .",
    "the first is the pairing of two cellular components freely diffusing through the cytoplasm and is a direct consequence of the diffusion .",
    "the second mechanism is the `` spontaneous '' rupture of the binding and the release of the two components as the result of thermal excitation .",
    "the last main stochastic process involved is an active one , since it requires / uses energy , and corresponds to the processing capability of both polymerase and ribosome .",
    "the active processes associated to polymerases and ribosomes are highly sophisticated steps , including for example dedicated proof reading mechanisms . in order to proceed to transcription initiation",
    ", gene expression needs a successful binding of the polymerase to a specific dna motif . after the initiation step",
    ", the messenger chain is built through a series of specific stochastic processes , in which the polymerase recruits one of the four nucleotides in accordance to the dna template .",
    "a similar description is associated to the translation step .",
    "in particular the protein elongation results in an iterative energy - consuming procedure in which each codon of the messenger chain is coupled with a particular trna , which adds a new amino - acid to the growing protein chain by means of ribosome .    in summary , most of the elementary processes can be schematically seen as the encounter of two components in a viscous fluid .",
    "however , the classic approach to gene expression modeling is to group those elementary processes into critic steps as initiation , elongation and degradation , which are common to both transcription and translation .",
    "the corresponding mathematical model is now described .",
    "for all the reasons given so far , the total number of copies of a given protein in the cell is a _ random _ variable @xmath4 .",
    "the cell can thus be thought as a system that produces a given protein with average concentration @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 $ ] denotes the expected value of a random variable @xmath7 .",
    "the protein concentration , which can vary of several orders of magnitude depending on the protein type , is in direct connection with the various parameters through a quite simple formula , as will be shown in the sequel .",
    "the main objective of the paper is to derive an explicit representation of the variance of the number of proteins in terms of the various parameters of the protein production process .",
    "* gene activation*. the gene activation involves complex processes among which the main ones are the association / dissociation of a repressor .",
    "usually the whole process is described as a telegraph process for which a transition from inactive state @xmath8 to active state @xmath9 occurs at rate @xmath10 and , similarly from state @xmath9 to state @xmath8 at rate @xmath11 .",
    "here the fundamental assumption is that the distribution of these steps is exponential . in a prokaryotic cell , there may be several copies of a specific gene and this fact has been included in few models in the past years , see paulsson  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since we are interested in the variance of the number of proteins , we will assume in the following sections that there is only one copy of the gene .",
    "the analogous result for the case with multiple copies is straightforward to obtain since , by independence , the variance of protein number is proportional to the number of copies of the gene . * transcription*. a rna polymerase binds on an active gene in an exponential time with rate @xmath12 . this effective rate measures the frequency of transcription initiation and takes into account several physical parameters , including , for example , the _ affinity _ between the specific gene and the polymerase .",
    "the distribution @xmath13 on @xmath14 of the lifetime @xmath15 of a mrna is assumed to be general .",
    "* translation*. similarly , the binding of a ribosome on an mrna occurs in an exponentially distributed time with rate @xmath16 , which measures the frequency of translation initiation and includes also the affinity between messenger and ribosome .",
    "the distribution @xmath17 of the lifetime @xmath18 of the protein is also general .",
    "the decay of the protein concentration occurs for two main reasons : by _ proteolysis _ , _ i.e. _ the protein degradation into amino acids , or by cellular dilution , due to the cellular volume increase of the bacterium during the exponential growth phase .",
    "this paper is focused in the process of the production of a given protein .",
    "for this reason , the interaction with the production process of other proteins is not considered .",
    "this is the fundamental model used to describe gene expression in the literature .",
    "we can already find these key steps in the first systematic and accurate studies of stochastic models for gene expression , as rigney  @xcite and berg  @xcite .",
    "in recent years the three - stages model has been used as the fundamental structure in most well - known works of shahrezaei and swain  @xcite , paulsson  @xcite and peccoud and ycart  @xcite .    the promoter of the gene , corresponding to the specific protein of interest , can be in one of two possible states : active or inactive . in these studies",
    "transcription , translation and the degradation of proteins and messengers are modeled as first - order chemical reactions , _",
    "i.e. _ they are supposed to be exponentially distributed ( or geometrically distributed in case of a discrete time setting ) .",
    "see paulsson  @xcite for an extensive survey on the subject . with the above notations ,",
    "this amounts to say that @xmath15 and @xmath18 are exponentially distributed .",
    "the assumption of exponentially distributed durations of the various phases of the three - stage model leads naturally to a markovian modeling .",
    "the overall dynamic of gene activation can be described , see paulsson  @xcite , by the random variable @xmath19 , where @xmath20 indicates that the gene is active at time @xmath21 , while @xmath22 if it is inactive .",
    "recall that we consider , without loss of generality , only the one gene case .",
    "if we denote by @xmath23 the number of mrnas and by @xmath24 the number of proteins , then it turns out that @xmath25 is a markov process with values in @xmath26 .",
    "this representation is common to most of the models of the literature . some of them have , in fact , a lower dimensional state space because of assumptions on the number of mrnas for example . as a consequence ,",
    "the general theory of markov processes gives a system of linear differential equations of order @xmath9 , the fokker - planck equations , for the functions @xmath27 , the probability that @xmath28 is in state @xmath29 at time @xmath21 .",
    "the system of equations has the general form @xmath30 the solution of the system has a unique stable point @xmath31 , the invariant distribution of the markov process , whose explicit expression is not known to the best of our knowledge .",
    "nevertheless , since the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 are linear with respect to @xmath34 , the moments of the invariant distribution satisfy a recurrence equation .",
    "this equation is not completely simple , but gives an explicit expression for the first two moments and , in particular , for the variance , which is the key quantity to investigate these stochastic models .",
    "this is the main theoretical result used in many papers in literature , see rigney  @xcite .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this approach is possible only under the assumption that _ all _ the duration of the main steps ( like the production time of an mrna or of a protein ) are exponentially distributed .",
    "this assumptions is now discussed .",
    "we refer to _ exponential assumption _ when the time to produce a particular cellular component and its lifetime , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath18 , are assumed to be exponentially distributed .",
    "the exponential assumption is natural in the following simple situation : if a large number of trials are necessary to achieve some goal ( like the binding of some elements on a the dna of an mrna ) and each trial requires some duration @xmath35 and succeeds with probability @xmath36 . if @xmath37 is the total number of attempts to succeed , i.e. @xmath38 , then @xmath39 in other words , if @xmath36 is small then @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an exponential random variable with mean @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the total duration of time necessary to realize the objective is , due to the averaging of the law of large numbers ( @xmath37 is large ) , @xmath42 and is therefore exponentially distributed with mean @xmath43 .",
    "as it is seen , this scheme may describe correctly the duration of time to establish a binding of a polymerase or , of a ribosome .",
    "this scheme may properly describe the time required for a successful binding of rna polymerase to the gene and of ribosome to mrna .",
    "it should be noted that this assumption may not be true if one considers the elongation time of an mrna or a protein chain . in particular during the polypeptide elongation , each trna , transporting a specific amino acid , should bind to the ribosome .",
    "if the distribution of the duration of this step is indeed exponential , nevertheless the fact that elongation steps requires an average number of 100 - 300 steps , one for each amino acid , then the resulting distribution of the duration of the whole process is not anymore exponential . in first approximation , because of the large number of elongation steps , a deterministic elongation time with a small gaussian perturbation should be considered .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is to show , via convenient mathematical tools , that the assumption on the distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath18 has an important impact on the qualitative properties of the protein production process .",
    "if the distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath18 are not exponential , a markovian description of the system is no longer possible , since the residual lifetimes of all the components have to be included in the state variable . in this case , to get a possible analogue of the pde  , an infinite dimensional state space would be required .",
    "for this reason , there is little hope to use , as it has been done up to now in the literature , the equivalent of fokker - planck equations to get explicit results like the first moments at equilibrium .",
    "our approach consists in representing the state of the system as a functional of several marked point process .",
    "see the appendix for the general definitions and results concerning these processes .",
    "if it may be difficult to have a pde formulation to the problem , we can have a quite detailed description of the distribution of the number of proteins without solving recurrence equations by using an alternative method , which use some nice properties of the point processes .",
    "see robert  @xcite .",
    "the method is presented in the next section .",
