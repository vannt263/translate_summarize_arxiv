    "experimental and theoretical studies of high-@xmath2 materials with correlated pinning centers have led to the discovery of many novel phases of vortex matter , nonexistent in the pristine materials .",
    "these new phases arise from the complex interplay between intrinsic point disorder , correlated disorder , vortex - vortex interaction , and temperature . correlated disorder in high-@xmath0 crystals",
    "is often introduced by heavy ion irradiation along the crystallographic c - axis , which leads to a random distribution in the a - b plane  @xcite .",
    "the effects of such random correlated disorder on the high-@xmath2 phase diagram are relatively well - understood , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . measurements of crystals with periodic correlated disorder are limited , since it is not yet known how to physically realize periodic correlated disorder in thick samples . experimental studies of periodic disorder must therefore choose between two options : study of thin samples , or study of artificial pins located at the sample surface .",
    "efforts have focused mainly on the study of thin superconducting films with periodic pinning centers  @xcite .",
    "however , thin films do not necessarily retain the thermodynamic properties of the bulk crystal , due to enhanced point disorder .",
    "comparison of the resulting vortex phases to the thermodynamic phases of the pristine material is thus usually not possible .",
    "theoretically , the thermodynamics of vortices in the presence of _ random _ correlated disorder have been studied extensively .",
    "nelson and vinokur  @xcite mapped the pinned vortex matter onto a system of quantum 2d bosons .",
    "they predicted the bose glass transition from the low - temperature bose glass phase , in which vortices are localized , to a higher - temperature delocalized vortex phase .",
    "they also discussed the possibility of an incompressible mott insulator ( mi ) phase , when the magnetic induction of the sample @xmath3 exactly equals the matching field @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the density of the columnar defects .",
    "radzihovsky  @xcite extended this model to include additional phases for @xmath6 : a low - temperature weak bose glass phase , in which both vortices residing at pins and those at interstitial sites are localized , an interstitial liquid phase at intermediate temperature , in which interstitial vortices are free to move but those at pinning sites are still pinned , and a homogenous liquid phase at higher temperature , in which all vortices are delocalized . for _ periodic _ pinning centers ,",
    "the various bose glass phases may be modified  @xcite . for periodic surface holes ,",
    "even such a modified description is expected to be valid only within some finite depth from the surface of the superconductor .",
    "simulations of two - dimensional systems containing periodic pinning centers that allow only single - vortex occupancy demonstrate commensurate states at integer matching fields @xmath7 , with permitted values of @xmath8 depending on the geometry of the pinning centers  @xcite",
    ". solutions of ginzburg - landau theory reveal additional commensurate states with multi - quanta vortices  @xcite for more general sample and pinning center parameters .",
    "different melting scenarios have been demonstrated for triangular and kagom arrays at low matching fields  @xcite , and for square pinning arrays both at and in - between matching fields  @xcite . the square pinning array at the first matching field displays three phases : a low - temperature pinned solid with square geometry , an unpinned (  floating \" ) solid with triangular geometry , and a high - temperature liquid that lacks long - range order . at higher commensurate matching fields , the floating solid phase is not found , but an intermediate phase with mobile interstitial vortices similar to the liquid is observed .",
    "incommensurate fields display a pinned phase at low temperatures with extra vortices located at interstitial positions , a phase at intermediate temperatures in which some vortex motion is present with both interstitials and pinned vortices participating , and a phase at higher temperatures , in which all vortices are mobile .",
    "the temperature at which mobility is observed for incommensurate fields is lower than the melting temperature at the commensurate matching fields  @xcite . for the triangular and kagom geometries , melting at the first matching field involves a low - temperature pinned solid and a high - temperature liquid only .",
    "intermediate - temperature phases , in which some or all of the interstitial vortices are mobile , are observed at higher matching fields  @xcite .",
    "these melting transitions are expected to be most relevant to high-@xmath0 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "direct imaging experiments of low-@xmath0 thin films with artificial periodic disorder have shown that highly ordered vortex states exist at integer @xmath7 and fractional @xmath9 matching fields , with @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 integers  @xcite .",
    "due to these ordered vortex states , such films have demonstrated commensurate effects in critical current  @xcite , magnetization  @xcite , magneto - resistance  @xcite , and magnetic susceptibility measurements  @xcite .",
    "possible phases and phase transitions of the vortex matter have been inferred from these measurements .",
    "enhanced flux creep rate for @xmath6 was thought to be evidence of a transition from an incompressible mi state to an interstitial liquid state  @xcite .",
    "shapiro steps in transport measurements were understood to be a result of the coexistence of vortices pinned to artificial pinning sites and mobile interstitial vortices  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the critical current was interpreted as evidence of two depinning energies , corresponding to the upper boundaries of the weak bose glass and interstitial liquid phases  @xcite .",
    "onsets of nonzero real and imaginary parts of the magnetic susceptibility were tentatively identified as the lower and upper phase boundaries of an interstitial liquid phase  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these states , the possibility of a saturation number @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath13 vortices at each pinning site , leads to multiple - quanta pinned vortex states , which have been observed in many samples  @xcite .",
    "there are fewer experimental data regarding the thermodynamic phases of high-@xmath0 superconductors with periodic artificial pinning centers .",
    "the critical current in @xmath14 ( ybco ) thin films exhibited integer commensurate effects  @xcite over a large temperature range .",
    "scanning hall probe measurements indicated that trapping of @xmath15 flux quanta is possible for @xmath16m - diameter holes close to @xmath0 in ybco  @xcite .",
    "thin crystalline @xmath1 ( bscco ) samples with fully - penetrating periodic holes exhibited integer  @xcite and rational  @xcite matching effects , in magneto - resistance and transport measurements , respectively .",
    "similar samples with surface holes also displayed matching effects in magneto - resistance and critical current  @xcite .",
    "a single study using thick bscco samples with surface holes displayed integer matching in local magnetization  @xcite . in these studies of bscco , the matching effects were visible in the field and temperature ranges at which the vortex matter is known to be in a liquid state in pristine crystals .",
    "no first - order melting step  @xcite was measured in these samples , and a full description of thermodynamic phases and transitions is lacking .",
    "in this work , we present an investigation of a thick bscco crystal , partially patterned with periodic surface holes created by a focused ion beam , measured using differential magneto - optics ( dmo )  @xcite accompanied by shaking with transverse ac field  @xcite .",
    "we observe step - like behavior of the irreversibility line ( il ) , which may be a result of multi - quanta pinning to holes .",
    "we see a reduction in the dmo signal at integer matching fields , evidence of mi phases .",
    "we find a first - order melting transition ( fot ) in the patterned regions that is not shifted with respect to the pristine melting line .",

    "the plateau - like behavior indicates that this shaking - induced hopping is roughly independent of the number of vacancies that exists .",
    "instead , the degree of hopping or depinning is dependent on the balance between the roughly field - independent pinning energy of the @xmath138th vortex and the activation energy of the applied shaking . within the single - vortex pinning scenario , above the il",

    "note that eq .",
    "[ eq : n0 ] was derived from the pinning energy of a _ single _ hole . in the case of an _ array _ of holes ,",
    "one should compare the free energy of a pinned @xmath8th vortex to its free energy at the midpoint between two neighboring holes . at this midpoint",
    ", there are positive contributions to the free energy from the neighboring occupied holes .",
    "thus a higher free energy of the pinned vortex , or @xmath168 , would still be an equilibrium state of the system .",

    "[ fig : pd](c ) ) , with @xmath169  k , @xmath170  k , and @xmath171  k. according to the schematic phase diagram plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenarios](d ) , the values of @xmath146 are lower than the temperatures @xmath131 at which the @xmath8-th multi - quanta vortex depins in the absence of thermal fluctuations . from the schematic description in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenarios](c ) , we see that the difference @xmath172 may be estimated from the difference in the @xmath60 at , and slightly away from , @xmath136 . from figs .",
    "[ fig : meltmatch](c ) and [ fig : meltmatch2](c ) , we estimate this difference to be @xmath173k . @xmath174 and @xmath175 are thus @xmath176 and @xmath177k , respectively , or equivalently , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "we find that the extracted @xmath138 values are much lower than the estimated @xmath13 , and slightly higher than the estimated @xmath158 .",
    "thus the equilibrium multi - quanta pinning scenario described by eq .",
    "[ eq : n0 ] is more plausible .",
    "note , however , that eqs .",
    "[ eq : ns ] and [ eq : n0 ] are based on the assumption of fully penetrating holes ; the number of vortices trapped by surface holes may be lower  @xcite .",
    "summarizing our discussion of the il , the multi - quanta scenario provides a more consistent explanation as compared to single - vortex pinning , both for the steps in the il and for the similar mi fingers at both commensurate and incommensurate matching fields .",
    "indeed , recent simulations of bscco with surface holes similar to those in the experiment  @xcite indicate that multiple - quanta occupation of surface holes does occur , and that depinning may occur directly from holes .",
    "finally , we address the apparent contradiction of observing a fot within the patterned regions _ at matching fields _ @xmath182 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : meltmatch ] and [ fig : meltmatch2 ] .",
    "the observed fot occurs at the same field and temperature values as the pristine solid - liquid transition @xmath49 , and we therefore assume that both transitions are of similar nature .",
    "this , however , seems to contradict the existence of mi phases at matching fields , since in the mi phase the vortex lattice is ordered , pinned , and incompressible , up to temperatures well above the pristine @xmath49 .",
    "the observed fot can be understood qualitatively by taking the bulk beneath the surface holes into account .",
    "the surface holes are only @xmath183 m deep , whereas the sample is @xmath184 m thick .",
    "although the depth at which vortices are still sensitive to surface patterning is not known exactly , magnetic decorations of bscco crystals with square fe periodic surface patterns indicate that the hexagonal structure of the lattice is recovered fully just @xmath185 m beneath the pinning potential at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "thus one may expect that sufficiently deep below the upper surface , the vortex ",
    "tails \" will undergo a first - order melting transition at the pristine @xmath49 . at matching fields , however , the  tips \" of the vortices at the surface are pinned to the periodic surface holes , and therefore behave as an incompressible solid . the resulting situation immediately above @xmath49 is rather unique : the vortex  tips \" are in a solid mi state , while the vortex  tails \" are liquid . at the fot , the vortex density in the bulk increases by @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the typical step in @xmath3 at @xmath49 . if the  tips \" of the vortices were fully incompressible , this @xmath187 in the bulk would be completely shielded and unobservable at the top surface .",
    "our data indicate , however , that within our experimental range of parameters the compressibility is high , but finite .",
    "hence the mi top layer is sufficiently transparent to allow observation of the paramagnetic peak at the fot of the underlying vortex",
    " tails \" .",
    "we conclude that upon increasing temperature , the fot observed within the patterned region at matching fields indicates a transition from a solid bulk with an incompressible solid surface to a unique state of an essentially incompressible solid crust of vortex  tips \" concealing a vortex liquid in the bulk .",
    "it is interesting to note that this solid crust could be used as a tool to study the interesting possibility of surface melting that was suggested to exist in the vortex lattice  @xcite , similar to surface wetting in atomic solids .",
    "this will require investigating crystals of different thicknesses and samples patterned with holes at both the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "no additional fots were observed , even in the presence of shaking .",
    "this indicates that the depinning line of the interstitial vortices , and the delocalization line of the vortices pinned to holes , are apparently _ not _ fots .",
    "more accurate magnetization measurements in the presence of shaking are needed to check for the existence of second - order thermodynamic transitions .",
    "bscco crystals with arrays of surface holes were measured using differential magneto - optics accompanied by an in - plane shaking field .",
    "we observe reduced @xmath42 of the patterned regions at integer matching fields @xmath188 .",
    "these features are extremely narrow , with a width in @xmath34 of less than @xmath189oe .",
    "the region of reduced @xmath42 extends up to @xmath190 for the first matching field , terminating @xmath191 below @xmath0 .",
    "shaking allowed the equilibrium matching feature to be observed both above and below the pristine melting line of the sample .",
    "this observation is in contrast to previous dynamic measurements of bscco crystals with periodic surface holes  @xcite , in which matching effects were observed only well above the pristine melting line .",
    "our finding of a sharply suppressed compressibility of an equilibrated vortex lattice at the matching fields is a strong evidence of the existence of mott insulator phases .",
    "we observe a first - order melting transition within the patterned areas , both away from matching and at the first and second matching fields .",
    "surprisingly , this transition is not shifted with respect to the pristine melting transition .",
    "we interpret this transition as first - order melting of the vortices in the pristine bulk beneath the patterned surface , that results in a step in vortex density . the added vortex ",
    "tails \" beneath the patterned surface force vortex  tips \" through the surface , even in regions of reduced compressibility .",
    "we emphasize that this is an extremely unusual situation , in which the vortex tails located in the bulk are in a liquid phase , while their tips located near the surface are in a pinned , ordered phase , and therefore solid .",
    "the irreversibility line of the patterned regions is found to be shifted upward in @xmath34 and @xmath33 to above the pristine melting line @xmath49 , and displays step - like behavior , with almost no temperature dependence between matching fields @xmath188 .",
    "these steps are consistent with a multi - vortex pinning scenario , with an estimated maximum value of @xmath192 flux quanta pinned to each surface hole at @xmath193 and @xmath194  k.    applied shaking shifts the irreversibility line to lower field and temperature , enabling the observation of the first - order transition . however , no first - order transitions related to the surface holes , corresponding to depinning lines of interstitial vortices , or delocalization of vortices pinned to holes , were observed .",
    "further transport measurements are necessary to determine if an additional delocalization line exists at higher temperatures , in analogy to the delocalization line of the vortices residing on columnar defects , that separates the interstitial liquid from a homogeneous liquid  @xcite .",
