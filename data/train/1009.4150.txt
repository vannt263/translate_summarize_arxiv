    "the radio emission of solar flares and transients includes a plethora of emission processes which serve as diagnostic tools for the analysis of non - thermal electron distributions , plasma waves and turbulence ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "they are caused by plasma instabilities driving various wave modes that in turn may emit observable radiation .",
    "some of the processes are reasonably well understood others are open research issues .",
    "solar radio spectrographs have revealed a large variety of solar radio  bursts taking place in the solar corona .",
    "as observations at different wavelengths sample different heights and physical conditions in the solar atmosphere , with longer wavelengths referring to higher heights above the photosphere , these phenomena can in principle be probed from the bottom of the corona to large distances in the interplanetary medium .",
    "this report is a brief account of a decade of the artemis ",
    "iv solar radiospectrograph operation in the field of observational analysis of solar radio bursts .",
    "the solar radiospectrograph of the university of athens ( artemis - iv ) is in operation at the thermopylae satellite communication station since 1996 .",
    "the observations extend from the base of the solar corona ( 650 mhz ) to about 2 solar radii ( 20 mhz ) it offers high quality recordings with time resolution 1/10 - 1/100 sec , in the form of dynamic spectra ; which is radio flux as a function of height in the corona .",
    "the radio emission is collected by two antennas .",
    "firstly , a 7-meter parabolic antenna with equatorial mounting covering the frequency range 100650 mhz ; it tracks the sun in declination and hour angle .",
    "secondly , a stationary _ inverted v _",
    "antenna is used for the 20 to 110 mhz range . the incoming signal from the two antennas",
    "is combined and then shared between two receivers ( figure [ configuration ] ) . the sweep frequency receiver ( analyseur de spectre globalor asg ) , covers the range of 20 - 650 mhz at 10 samples / sec , with a dynamic range of 70 db . the acousto - optical receiver ( spectrographe acousto optique or sao ) , which covers the range of 270 - 450 mhz at 100 samples / sec , with a dynamic range of 25 db .",
    "a detailed description of the receivers can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data acquisition is performed by two pcs ( equipped with 12 bit , 225 ksamples / sec dac , one for every receiver ) , connected through ethernet .",
    "the daily operation is fully automated .",
    "the recordings are in the form of dynamic spectra from the asg and the sao .",
    "the asg gives good observations of strong , broad band events , such as type iii groups and type ii / type iv bursts .",
    "the sao , on the other hand , has a higher sensitivity and lower noise compared to classic sweep ",
    "frequency receivers , although its dynamic range is rather limited ; there is a wealth of fine structure comprising of weak , small time scale as well as narrow band features observable at this resolution .    in order to enhance small fluctuations and features which are usually undetected as they are superimposed on high level activity the time derivative of the intensity for each frequency channel is often used .",
    "positive derivatives are coded in black , negative in white and all intermediate grey levels have been adjusted to obtain an optimal presentation of the events .",
    "the daily spectra of the asg with a reduced time resolution of 5 seconds ( quick looks ) are available on line from the artemis - iv web page ( cf figure [ quicklook01 ] for an example ) .",
    "higher resolution data are available on request .",
    "in the following subsections , we review in brief , observational results of solar radio bursts , recorded by artemis - iv and , mostly combined with data from other sources :      the sa electrons constitute a class of intense interplanetary type iii bursts closely associated to meter - wave ( coronal ) type ii bursts .",
    "the acronym sa is interpreted either as _ shock accelerated _ or as _ shock associated _ ; thus expressing an uncertainty on the origin of the electrons responsible for the sa events .",
    "they are thought to be produced by electrons accelerated by shock waves in the solar corona as an extension of _ herringbone structures _ or by electrons accelerated in the chromosphere in the same energy release that has launched the shock .",
    "an almost complete frequency coverage of an sa radio event and related phenomena observed on may 6 , 1996 at 9:27 ut was presented for the first time ( @xcite , cf . also figure [ may96 ] ) .",
    "it was observed from the base of the solar corona up to almost 1 au from the sun by the following radio astronomical instruments :    * the ondrejov spectrometer operating in 4.51 ghz ( radiation produced near the chromosphere ) * the artemis - iv spectrograph operating in 600110mhz ( 1.11.4r from sun center ) * the nanay decametric array decameter array in 7525 mhz ( 1.42 r ) * the rad2 and rad1 radio receivers on the wind spacecraft covering the range from 14 mhz20 khz ( 3r1au ) .",
    "the observations show that the sa event starts from a coronal type ii radio burst which traces the progression of a shock wave through the corona above @xmath0 from the sun center .",
    "this sa event had no associated radio emission in the decimetric - metric range , thus there is no evidence for electron injection in the low / middle corona and , as a case study , corroborates the shock acceleration .",
    "disappearing transequatorial loops have been observed on several occasions in association with the onset of coronal mass ejections .",
    "the opening of the cme magnetic field can be revealed by radio observations since the radio emission sources trace the propagation paths of electrons ( along the loops before they open up completely ) .",
    "a multi  wavelength analysis of two events ( february 8 , 2000 , cf .",
    "@xcite & may 2 , 1998 cf .",
    "@xcite ) was performed in order to test the transequatorial loop disappearance association with the cme lift off .",
    "observational data were obtained from :    * soho lasco ,  in white light ) . *",
    "soho eit ,  in euv * yohkoh ,  in sxr * the artemis ",
    "iv * the nanay radioheliograph ( nrh ) .",
    "this study provided combined observations of large ",
    "scale loop  like sxr & euv dimmings coincident , on disk , with type iii ( j ) family bursts tracing the abovementioned loops and type iv emission marking the cme lift  off .",
    "this evidence in support of large scale field line opening preceding the lift  off of material corroborates the _ breakout _ model of cme launch formulated by @xcite .",
    "the question whether a given coronal wave was driven by a cme or it was ignited by a flare is an open   research issue ; this issue was addressed in a _",
    "case study_(@xcite ) of the large flare / cme event that occurred close to the west solar limb on 3 november 2003 .",
    "the comprehensive multi  wavelength coverage of this event , from radio to hxr , marked this event as an appropriate candidate for this type of analysis .",
    "the data included :    * ha filtergrams from the kanzelhohe solar observatory ( kso ) * x  ray images in sxr from goes-12 and in hxr from the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager * euv images from soho eit * dynamic spectra from : the artemis ",
    "iv , the radiospectrograph of the solar radio laboratory of izmiran , the potsdam  tremsdorf radiospectrograph , the rt4/5 spectrograph of ondrejov , the phoenix - spectroghraph of eth zurich & the rad1 radio receiver on the wind spacecraft . * the nanay radioheliograph . *",
    "magnetograms from the michelson doppler imager onboard soho * white light observations from soho lasco .",
    "the analysis indicated that the physical relationship between cme / flare and the coronal wave ( shock ) may be quite complex .",
    "in this case it was found that the coronal shock that produced the moreton wave and the associated type ii burst was generated by the energy release in the flare rather than by the cme expansion ; this evidence in support of the flare initiated shock however does not preclude the cme initiation scenario .",
    "a catalogue of the type ii and type iv solar radio bursts in the 110687 mhz range , observed with artemis - iv in 19982000 was presented ( @xcite ) ; these were compared with the lasco archives of coronal mass ejections and the solar geophysical reports of solar flares ( ha & sxr ) and examined for possible associations . the main results of this work corroborating previous works ( @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are :    * 68% of the catalogue events were associated with cmes . * 67% of the type ii events",
    "were associated with cmes , in accordance with previous results .",
    "t his percentage rises to 79% in the case of composite type ii / iv events . * 77% of the type iv continua",
    "were associated with cmes , which is higher that the cme  type ii association probability .",
    "* the type ii associated cmes had an average velocity of @xmath1 , while the cmes without type iis had an average velocity of @xmath2 . * all events , but one , were well associated with ha and/or sxr flares .",
    "* most of the cme launch times precede by 560 min ( 30 min on average ) the associated sxr flare peak ; an important fraction ( 72% ) precede the flare onset as well . *",
    "most of the type ii associated cmes have velocities greater than 400 km / sec .    in figure [ cmeshockflare ]",
    ", we present a _ comprehensive _ schematic of the cme , flare and radio burst sequence of events for the total of our data set .",
    "an efficient algorithm for the detection of linear and quasi ",
    "linear structures in grey - scale images was developed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this algorithm introduces the _ angular energy density _ and detects angular distribution of these structures in images ; this statistical approach proves to be of value in case of a great number of line segments .",
    "as is based on fast fourier transform methods , the computational efficiency and , in turn , the rate of estimation are high .",
    "as regards solar radio burst fine structure the method proposed appears quite sensitive in slope detection .",
    "due to the correspondence between frequency and height in the corona the slopes of bursts on the time - frequency dynamic spectra provide direct estimation of exciter speed .",
    "this algorithm is a useful tool in the study of solar radio bursts wih a drift , such as type iii , fibers etc ; an example is demonstrated in figure [ fe ] .",
    "a new type of super  short structures ( ssss ) recorded during metric type iv bursts is reported in @xcite .",
    "their duration , at half power ranges from 4 - 50 ms , almost 10 times shorter than spikes at corresponding frequencies .",
    "the solar origin of the ssss was confirmed by one - to - one correspondence between spectral recordings of artemis  iv and high time resolution single frequency measurements ( trieste  italy ) .",
    "the recorded of _ sss _ were divided in three categories :    * _ simple broad - band ssss _ ; characterized by a bandwidth @xmath3 .",
    "they are further subdivided in : * * _ sss - pulses _ have duration 1020 ms , and bandwidth @xmath4 .",
    "they appear in groups and , occasionally , exhibit quasi - periodic behaviour . * * _ drifting ssss _ have duration 30 - 70 ms .",
    "their bandwidth in general exceeds the 100 mhz , and measured frequency drift rates ( @xmath5 400 - 1000 mhz / sec ) . *",
    "_ simple narrow - band ssss _ are distinguished by their narrow bandwidth @xmath6 .",
    "they are , also , subdivided into : * * _ spike - like ssss _ are the shortest _ ssss _ with duration 4 - 30 ms . their bandwidth is mostly @xmath7 20 mhz .",
    "if measurable , frequency drifts are @xmath8 . *",
    "* _ patch  like ssss _ exhibit , due to their morphological diversity , a rather broad range of duration varying between 4 and 50 ms .",
    "the frequency bandwidth is @xmath7 15 mhz , and it can be as low as a few mhz . this qualifies _",
    "like sss _ as the _ ssss _ of the narrowest bandwidth .",
    "their spectral appearance varies ; they can resemble dots , sails or flags and were further subdivided accordingly to : _ dot  like sss _ , _ sail - like sss _ and _ flag  like sss_. * _ complex super short structures _ are characterised by an emission and an absorption element .",
    "two subcategories could be distinguished : * * _ rain - drop bursts _ consist of a narrow - band emission _",
    "( @xmath9 ) and a broad - band absorption _ tail _ ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the durations are approximately 50 ms for the _ head _ and 30 ms for the _ tail_. both the _ head _ and the _ tail _ exhibit frequency drift which is @xmath11 mhz / sec and @xmath12 mhz / sec , respectively . * * _ blinkers _ are drifting bursts ( @xmath5 650 mhz / sec ) consisting of absorption element that is switching abruptly to emission element .",
    "opposite cases have also been found ( emission in the high - frequency part , and absorption in low - frequency part of the burst ) . the duration @xmath13 .",
    "they are the _ ssss _ with the largest bandwidth @xmath14 .",
    "artemis  iv is characterized by high time and frequency resolution as well as autonomous operation .",
    "we have obtained high quality data which are used in improving our understanding of solar radio bursts and of the underlying physics of the corona and the interplanetary medium .",
    "the particular areas of interest have been , transient activity and flares , energy dissipation , electron acceleration and transport during flares , radio signatures of cmes and coronal radio radiation amongst others .",
    "the most comprehensive results have been obtained from coordinated studies of radio observations and data recorded in other spectral ranges .",
    "further comparisons with observations of hxr , energetic electrons , euv and sxr imaging can put coherent emissions into context and may open exciting new possibilities for radio diagnostics unfolding their full potential as a tool for understanding plasma processes and energy release in the solar corona .    the use of industry standard hardware and the modular architecture of the system provide a significant potential for further expansion . in our future plans three acusto ",
    "optic receivers are envisaged for full spectral coverage .",
    "we also intend to develop and integrate processing algorithms for supervised learning and pattern recognition , in an attempt to minimize recording of inactive periods and to automate classification of observational data ."
