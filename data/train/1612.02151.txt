    "in this work , we have employed the higher - order mesonic potential to study its effect on the chiral symmetry breaking in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "so , the novelty of this work , that the effect of the magnetic field is not investigated in the framework of higher - order sigma model .",
    "this model applied only to calculate the hadron properties at low energy without considering magnetic field as in refs . @xmath6",
