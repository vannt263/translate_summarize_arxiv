    "reaching the ultimate precision limits in the estimation of parameters is an important challenge in science .",
    "usually , this estimation is made by measuring the state of a probe that has undergone a parameter - dependent process .",
    "post - selection techniques , stemming from the pioneering work of y. aharonov and collaborators @xcite , have been proposed with the aim of amplifying the signal obtained from the probe . in this formulation ,",
    "the quantum system being analyzed gets coupled to a measuring apparatus ( usually called `` meter '' ) through a unitary operation , which involves operators @xmath0 for the system @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the meter @xmath3 , and depends on the parameter @xmath4 to be estimated .",
    "the goal is to estimate @xmath4 by measuring the change of an observable of the meter after the joint unitary evolution , given that a specified state of @xmath1 was successfully post - selected .",
    "for a small coupling constant @xmath4 , the shift of the mean value of the relevant meter observable is modified by a prefactor , known as the weak - value @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the initial and the post - selected states of @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this quantity allows one to observe amplification effects provided the initial and the final state of the system are almost orthogonal , so long as the weak - value regime remains valid .",
    "the regime of validity of this result has been analyzed in several publications @xcite .",
    "the possibility of amplifying a tiny displacement of the meter ",
    "weak - value amplification ( wva )  has been envisaged as a valuable resource for the estimation of the coupling constant @xmath4 , eventually circumventing technical thresholds that may hinder the evaluation of this parameter @xcite .",
    "wva experiments have been performed with this metrological purpose @xcite , while claiming practical advantages . moreover , alternative protocols have been proposed @xcite to enhance the precision of the technique . however , there has been a long debate in the literature whether this post - selection process can actually be beneficial for parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the amplification of the signal comes at the cost of discarding most of the statistical data , due to the post - selection procedure .    .",
    "see text for complete description of the experiment .",
    "[ fig : setup],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    here we experimentally investigate the estimation of a small deflection @xmath4 of a mirror inside a sagnac interferometer within the framework of quantum metrology .",
    "we employ two post - selection protocols , which were shown @xcite to lead to the ultimate quantum limits for precision , for sufficiently small @xmath4 . in the first one , related to the wva approach , we explore the region of validity of wva and show that , beyond this region , when the meter does not give useful information on @xmath4 , estimation of this parameter can be obtained from the statistics of post - selection @xcite .",
    "we also experimentally demonstrate a post - selection procedure which , even though not leading to wva , may also reach the fundamental limits of precision , but with a much larger post - selection probability .",
    "this implies that the number of events registered by measuring the meter is much larger than that in the wva scheme , for the same amount of resources .",
    "this reflects in our experimental results , which clearly show that this second procedure leads to a more efficient determination of probabilities regarding the meter , in terms of frequencies of clicks in the measurement apparatus .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] . a red diode laser ( @xmath8 nm )",
    "is sent through a single - mode optical fiber ( sm - fiber ) and decoupled by an objective lens , producing , in good approximation , a collimated free - space gaussian beam with a width @xmath9 m .",
    "a 650@xmath1013 nm bandpass filter removes unwanted light .",
    "the polarization degree of freedom corresponds to the _ system _ , while the transverse spatial degree of freedom of the beam stands for the _ meter_. a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs1 ) and a half wave plate ( hwp1 ) are used to prepare a linear - polarization state @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , the system - meter input state for the interferometer is well described by : @xmath12\\ ! \\otimes\\ ! |\\phi_i\\rangle , \\label{eqtheta}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the horizontal and vertical polarization states , respectively , and @xmath15 stands for the initial transverse spatial state .",
    "the sagnac interferometer is composed of three mirrors ( m4 , m5 and m6 ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs2 ) .",
    "the horizontal polarization component of the input beam propagates through the interferometer in the clockwise direction , while the vertical one circulates in the counterclockwise direction , recombining again at pbs2 .",
    "a stepper motor controls the deflection angle of mirror m5 .",
    "this results in transverse momentum shifts in opposite directions for the horizontal- and vertical - polarized components , respectively .",
    "therefore , the overall effect of the interferometer on the input beam can be represented by the unitary operator : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 represents the transverse position operator and @xmath4 is the shift in transverse momentum , which is much smaller than the wavenumber @xmath19 of the light beam . after the interferometer , a @xmath20 mm lens ( l ) implements a fourier transform of the transverse spatial field at mirror m5 onto the detection plane , defined by the detection aperture of a single - photon avalanche detector ( apd ) .",
    "the polarization measurement setup consists of a half - wave plate ( hwp2 ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs3 ) , which allows for post - selecting any linear polarization state @xmath21 .",
    "a sliding beam - blocking stage ( bbs ) is used for the meter measurement after post - selection .",
    "this system works like a quadrant detector .",
    "the detection aperture of the apd is 8 mm diameter , much larger than the beam . by counting photons while blocking half of the detector",
    ", we can determine the center of the beam , as will be discussed below .",
    "the cramr - rao inequality provides the lower bound on the uncertainty @xmath22 in the estimation of the parameter @xmath4 : @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the number of repetitions of the measurement and @xmath25 is the fisher information , defined by @xmath26[dp_j(g)/dg]^2 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the probability of obtaining experimental result @xmath28 , given that the value of the parameter is @xmath4 .",
    "the maximization of @xmath25 over all possible measurements on the system yields the _ quantum _ fisher information @xcite , which provides the ultimate precision bounds .",
    "for pure initial states and unitary evolutions , it is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the generator of the unitary transformation , and the averages are taken with respect to the initial quantum state . from eq .",
    ", @xmath31 , so , assuming that initially @xmath32 ( balanced - meter condition ) , one has @xmath33 , where the average is taken in the initial state @xmath15 of the meter . therefore , the larger the variance of position in the initial state of the meter , the more information about the parameter is imprinted by the unitary evolution on the state of system+meter .    under post - selection on a state @xmath21 of the system",
    ", the fisher information about @xmath4 can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fisher information associated to measurements on the state of the meter after post - selection , and @xmath36 is the probability that the post - selection succeeds , while @xmath37}\\left[\\frac{dp_f(g)}{dg}\\right]^2\\ ] ] is the fisher information on @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath36 .    in @xcite , it was shown that , for sufficiently small @xmath4 , and for optimal measurement on the meter , post - selection on either the state @xmath38 or @xmath39 leads to a value of @xmath40 that coincides with the quantum fisher information @xmath41 , up to terms of @xmath42 . therefore , under these conditions , this procedure yields optimal information on the parameter .",
    "these results , developed in @xcite , differ from the standard wva approach in two important features : ( i ) the best post - selection _ is not _ on a state of @xmath1 quasi - orthogonal to the initial state ; and ( ii ) one should consider , in general , the statistics of post - selection , in addition to the results stemming from measurements on the meter . the choice @xmath39 does not lead to wva , but implies a probability of post - selection much higher than the wva procedure",
    ". we will show in this paper that this results in a more reliable determination of the probability distribution of the displacement of the meter , which is used for the estimation of @xmath4 .",
    "the experiment consists in applying a small misalignment @xmath4 to mirror m5 , sending light in the state @xmath43 into the interferometer , recording the statistics of post - selection events on the polarisation state @xmath21 , and measuring the mean transverse momentum of the light beam , after successful post - selection on @xmath21 . from the data",
    ", one finally extracts an estimation for @xmath4 , using a maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the post - selection probability @xmath36 is obtained by measuring , without the bbs , the photon counts @xmath44 reaching the apd when the setup is adjusted for post - selecting the state @xmath21 , as well as the photon counts @xmath45 corresponding to the state orthogonal to @xmath21 . for a large number of counts , @xmath36 is given by : @xmath46 the corresponding theoretical model leads to ( see appendix [ appx - pf ] ) @xmath47 where the @xmath48 sign corresponds to the post - selection @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 is the visibility of the interferometer and @xmath52 is related to the extinction ratio of the polarization optics.in our experiment , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "all of the information about @xmath4 that is encoded in the meter state @xmath55 can be retrieved via an optimal projective measurement . as described in @xcite , measurement of the observable @xmath56 , conjugate to @xmath57 ,",
    "is optimal for both post - selection procedures , as long as the meter state remains gaussian after the post - selection .",
    "in fact , in the region of validity of the wva , the distribution of the eigenvalues of the observable @xmath58 in the final meter state remains gaussian , with the same variance as in the initial state and shifted mean  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , measurement of the mean value @xmath59 is equivalent to measurement of @xmath58 . at the focal plane of lens",
    "l , a shift in the mean transverse momentum @xmath59 of the beam at mirror m5 is converted into a displacement of the beam center , given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , while the beam is resized to @xmath62 . for this reason , in order to measure a shift in @xmath59 , the beam center is measured with the bbs positioned at the focal plane of lens l. information about the beam displacement is then obtained via measurement of the number of photons reaching the two halves of the transverse plane during a given sampling time , which is equivalent to a split detector technique @xcite . for a gaussian beam with diameter @xmath63 ( at the focus ) ,",
    "subjected to a displacement @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 where @xmath66(@xmath67 ) is the number of photons detected on the left ( right ) half - plane . the corresponding theoretical model , taking into account the imperfect visibility , yields for the mean momentum deflection ( appendix [ appx - meter ] ) @xmath68",

    "notice that , in contrast to traditional wva approaches , the post - selection is not , in general , in a state quasi - orthogonal to @xmath11 . as @xmath21 approached orthogonality to @xmath11 , we could not provide reliable estimates for @xmath74 based on measurements on the meter alone . in our experiment this corresponds to the region @xmath76 , due to the value of @xmath77 used in the experiment .",
    "there are both fundamental and practical reasons for this .",
    "first , the wave packet of @xmath55 begins to distort and lose its gaussian shape . as a result ,",
    "direct measurement of the mean value @xmath59 is no longer optimal , and the the split detector is unable to measure the displacement of the non - gaussian beam correctly .",
    "finally , the quantity of information about @xmath4 encoded in the meter drops sharply to zero .",
    "however , in exactly this region where there is almost no information about the parameter @xmath4 in the state of the meter and the wva approach is no longer applicable , we have obtained excellent estimates of @xmath74 by considering only the post - selection probability @xmath36 .",
    "thus , by taking into account information from both the meter and the post - selection statistics , we are able to provide consistent estimates of @xmath74 for all values of @xmath75 .     as function of the initial state @xmath11 , for the post - selection @xmath78 .",
    "the measured uncertainties ( stars ) are shown for estimation via the statistics of post - selection events ( top figure ) and measurement on the meter state ( bottom figure ) .",

    "no other experimental imperfections are considered .",
    "this figure shows that our approach , based on the prevalence of the meter and the post - selection statistics in different regions , leads to uncertainties very close to the theoretical bounds .",
    "it is important to notice also that the mean number of photons used to estimate @xmath59 from the meter decreases steadily as @xmath75 decreases from @xmath79 to @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "since the maximum likelihood estimator is only asymptotically consistent , the reduction in the number of photons used in the estimation of the parameter @xmath74 via measurement on @xmath55 impairs the performance of the estimator , increasing its biasness and uncertainty .",
    "this is a drawback of post - selection procedures related to wva when compared to other strategies , if the total resources used in the experiment ( photon number in our case ) are kept constant .     from the experiment , for post - selection in @xmath39 .",
    "blue circles correspond to estimates from measurements on the meter , red squares correspond to estimates obtained via the statistics of post - selection events while black triangles correspond to estimates using information of both the meter and the statistics of post - selection events .",

    "information about @xmath4 encoded in the statistics of post - selection events begins to decrease for @xmath82 , and is zero for @xmath83 .",
    "this explains the increase in the error bars of the corresponding estimates for this range of values of @xmath75 . on the other side ,",
    "information about @xmath4 encoded in the meter dwindles when @xmath75 decreases from @xmath84 to @xmath80 , but never goes to zero .",
    "the degradation of the corresponding estimates in the region between @xmath85 and @xmath80 is due to the fact that measuring @xmath59 is no longer optimal and , in fact , the information about @xmath4 extractable via @xmath59 does goes to zero as the value of @xmath75 approaches @xmath80 .",
    "this behaviour is clearly displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare - qcrb - psi ] , which compares the experimental uncertainties in the estimation of the dimensionless parameter @xmath74 . as before",
    ", the qcrb takes into account the slighlty reduced visibility of the interferometer , and no other experimental imperfection .",
    "figure [ fig : compare - qcrb - psi ] also shows that the experimental uncertainty in the estimates produced from information of both the meter and the statistics of post - selection events are very close to the theoretical quantum bounds for all values of @xmath75 .",
    "it is important to notice that , contrary to the wva post - selection procedure , the probability of successful projection onto @xmath39 is close to unity for the whole range of values @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the mean number of photons used to estimate @xmath86 from the meter remains very close to the total number of photons injected into the interferometer , and does not lead to the degradation of the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator , as was the case for the wva - related strategy .",
    "furthermore , the fisher information corresponding to @xmath36 is now relevant over a wider range of initial states , as compared to the previous post - selection scheme , which is yet another advantage of the present procedure , since measuring @xmath36 is simple to implement and is always optimal , independently of the initial state .",
    "this is in stark contrast to optimal measurements on the meter , which depend on the initial state , and are therefore more challenging to implement .",
    "these two facts lead to the consistency of the estimates for any initial state @xmath11 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - psi ] , which result in a highly effective and robust metrological protocol that can , in principle , reach the ultimate precision bounds on parameter estimation .     as function of the initial - state parameter @xmath75 , for the post - selection @xmath39",

    "[ fig : compare - qcrb - psi],scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "we have experimentally investigated two post - selection - based measurement procedures from a quantum metrology point of view .",
    "one of these is a new post - selection procedure , which presents considerable advantages over the weak - value amplification ( wva ) scheme .",
    "the first method considered in this paper , related to the wva procedure , fails to provide a reasonable estimation of the parameter ( tilt of a mirror in the interferometer , described by @xmath4 ) from the state of the meter alone when the post - selection is around the region of highest amplification . in this same region ,",
    "the non - gaussian profile of the wave packet describing the meter makes it difficult to implement an optimal measurement on it .",
    "furthermore , the reduction in the number of photons that remain , due to the post - selection on a nearly orthogonal state , impairs the performance of the corresponding estimator .",
    "we show that accurate estimation of @xmath4 can be performed in this case when the statistics of the post - selection of the system are taken into account . in the new method",
    ", there is almost no reduction in detection events due to post - selection , since the corresponding probability remains close to one for all initial states .",
    "this leads to better performance of the meter estimator .",
    "in addition , information on @xmath4 is now distributed between the meter and the post - selection statistics over a wider range of initial states , which allows one to benefit from the information encoded in the post - selection statistics , which is simple to obtain experimentally from a measurement procedure that is always optimal , regardless of the initial state .",
    "this method leads to uncertainties in the estimation of @xmath4 that are closer to the quantum cramr - rao bound , particularly in the region where the information from the post - selection statistics is dominant .",
    "our experiment serves as a proof - of - principle demonstration that post - selection protocols can be metrologically efficient , as long as the information encoded in the post - selection statistics is also taken into account .",
    "it also throws new light on the subtle connection between post - selection procedures and quantum metrology , offering a viable and easy - to - implement procedure that can be easily generalized to other parameter estimation tasks .",
    "this research was supported by the brazilian agencies faperj , cnpq , capes , and the national institute of science and technology for quantum information .",
    "as described in the main text , the expected interaction implemented between the system and the meter by the sagnac interferometer would correspond to an unitary operator @xmath87 , as in eq.(2 ) .",
    "this leads to a probability of post - selection given by    [ pf ] p_f(g)=|@xmath88@xmath89|^2=(1+^2e^-2g^2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ) ,    where the + ( - ) sign correspond to the post - selected state @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , one can easily seen that , before the interaction takes place ( @xmath90 ) the post - selection probability onto the same initial state ( @xmath49 ) is @xmath91 irrespective of the initial state on the bloch sphere .",
    "this implies that the visibility of the interferometer should be 100% , whatever the initial state is , which does not correspond to the real experimental conditions , where tiny unwanted misalignment of the interferometer may affect the quality of the interference .    to account for a small relative misalignment in the @xmath92 direction ( perpendicular to @xmath93 , in the transverse plane ) ,",
    "it is enough to consider the same interaction , but now being implemented by @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the complete evolution would be described by :    [ evolucao - desalinhamento ] u_wu_g@xmath95@xmath89@xmath96 ,    where it is supposed that the spacial state is a product state between the directions @xmath93 and @xmath92 , represented by @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    the probability of post - selection is then given by    [ pf - desalinhamento ]    p_f(g)&=tr ( p_f u_wu_g@xmath95@xmath99@xmath89@xmath100@xmath96@xmath101u_w^u_g^ ) + & = tr_x ,    where @xmath102 . however , we have that    [ canal - defasagem1 ]    & tr_y(@xmath96@xmath101u_w^p_f u_w ) = @xmath101u_w^p_f u_w@xmath96 + & = p_f(dy|(y)|^2 ^ 2(wy ) ) + i[p_f , _ 3](dy |(y)|^2(wy)(wy ) ) + _ 3p_f_3 ( dy    & = ( 1-p/2)p_f + p/2_3p_f_3 ,    where @xmath103 , since the wave - function is gaussian and the second term in eq . vanishes .",

    "<S> post - selection strategies have been proposed with the aim of amplifying weak signals , which may help to overcome detection thresholds associated with technical noise in high - precision measurements . </S>",
    "<S> here we use an optical setup to experimentally explore two different post - selection protocols for the estimation of a small parameter : a weak - value amplification procedure and an alternative method , that does not provide amplification , but nonetheless is shown to be more robust for the sake of parameter estimation . </S>",
    "<S> each technique leads approximately to the saturation of quantum limits for the estimation precision , expressed by the cramr - rao bound . for both situations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that information on the parameter is obtained jointly from the measuring device and the post - selection statistics . </S>"
