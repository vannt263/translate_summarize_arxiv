    "transverse coronal loop oscillations were discovered by the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) in 1998 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these oscillations were initiated shortly after a solar flare that disturbed the loops . since their first observation , transverse oscillations have been routinely observed and studied . much before trace observations , the theory of loop oscillations was developed and the different kinds of oscillations were studied .",
    "the observed transverse motions have been interpreted in terms of the fundamental kink mode of the fast magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) oscillation @xcite , which is the only mode that can produce the observed transverse loop displacement .    in many cases the observed coronal loops belong to complex active regions and are not isolated but forming bundles or arcades of loops .",
    "for example , in @xcite antiphase transverse oscillations of adjacent loops were reported .",
    "in addition , in @xcite phase and antiphase motions were observed in a post - flare arcade . on the other hand , it is currently debated whether active region coronal loops are monolithic or multistranded ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the multistranded model , it is suggested that loops are formed by several tens or hundreds of strands considered as miniloops for which the heating plasma properties are approximately uniform in the transverse direction @xcite .",
    "most analytical studies about transverse loop oscillations have only considered the properties of individual loops . however , from the information provided by the observations , it is necessary to study not only individual loops but also how several tubes can oscillate as a whole , since their joint dynamics can be different from that of a single loop . only a few works",
    "have considered composite structures .",
    "@xcite studied the mhd normal modes of a periodic magnetic medium . @xcite and",
    "@xcite studied numerically the propagation of fast waves in two slabs unbounded in the longitudinal direction . in @xcite",
    "the oscillations of the prominence thread structure were investigated .",
    "these authors found that in a system of equal fibrils the only non - leaky mode is the symmetric one , which means that all the fibrils oscillate in spatial phase with the same frequency .",
    "@xcite studied a system of two coronal slabs and found that the symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be trapped .",
    "a more complex system of two coronal cylinders was studied in @xcite .",
    "four trapped normal modes were found and the interchange of energy between loops was shown by solving the time - dependent problem . in @xcite a multistranded loop formed by ten strands was considered .",
    "the composite loop oscillates transversely as a whole with a global motion of the strands after an external disturbance .",
    "this work shows that the bundle of strands oscillates with a combination of collective modes . on the other hand ,",
    "an analytical approximation to the normal modes of a loop pair has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "the authors assume the long wavelength approximation and obtain an analytical dispersion relation for two different tubes together with the four kink mode polarizations described in @xcite .    in this work we aim to study the normal modes of a loop set with different physical and geometrical properties by using the scattering theory .",
    "the scattering theory , or its matricial formulation called t - matrix theory , was first applied to magnetic tubes by .",
    "these authors studied the interaction of acoustic plane waves with an ensemble of parallel magnetic fibrils distributed uniformly in the so - called spaghetti sunspot model .",
    "the authors derived and solved the dispersion relation in the long wavelength limit . in the frequency shifts and velocity eigenfunctions",
    "were calculated for the case of random fibril distributions of up to 100 flux tubes .",
    "many other papers were published studying the cross section of a fibril spot insonified by external acoustic waves . in all these papers a non - magnetized external medium was considered and the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the acoustic oscillations were obtained .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the method to a system with an external magnetized medium , in order to extend previous works to coronal loop conditions .",
    "our model consists of an ensemble of parallel cylinders , without gravity and curvature .",
    "we consider uniform magnetic field in the internal loop medium and in the external or coronal medium .",
    "this assumption allows the interaction of the tubes through fast mhd waves .",
    "in addition , we explicitly calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the normal modes of the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ model ] the loop ensemble model and the equations for its dynamics are presented . in  [ normal_modes ]",
    "we briefly describe the t - matrix theory and apply it to our model . with this theory",
    "the exact eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of two non - identical loops are investigated in  [ 2loops ] .",
    "we study the dependence of the interaction with the relative density and radii of the loops .",
    "the study of three identical aligned loops is presented in  [ 3loops ] . in the same section",
    "the interaction between three non - identical loops is considered . finally in ",
    "[ disc_conc ] the results are summarized and the main conclusions are drawn .",
    "the equilibrium configuration used to model the loop set is a system of @xmath1-cylindrical , parallel homogeneous flux tubes , with the @xmath2-axis pointing in the direction of the loop axes .",
    "all loops have the same length , @xmath3 , and each individual loop , labeled @xmath4 , is characterized by the position of its center in the @xmath5-plane , @xmath6 , its radius , @xmath7 , and its density , @xmath8 .",
    "the density of the coronal environment is @xmath9 .",
    "the tubes and the external medium are permeated by a uniform magnetic field along the @xmath2-direction ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the alfvn speed , @xmath11 , takes the value @xmath12 inside the @xmath4-th loop and @xmath13 in the surrounding corona ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "limit these equations can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total pressure perturbation @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the @xmath2-component of the magnetic field perturbation .",
    "the other perturbed quantities , namely the velocity , @xmath20 , the magnetic field perturbation , @xmath21 , and the density perturbation , @xmath22 , can be derived from @xmath17 . we have assumed a @xmath2-dependence of the perturbations of the form @xmath23 .",
    "the line - tying effect is incorporated by setting @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an integer number .",

    "we only consider problems for which the time dependence is a simple harmonic oscillation with frequency @xmath27 .",
    "then , the total pressure perturbation can be written in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a function that includes the dependence on @xmath30 and @xmath31 . inserting this expression in equation ( [ wave_eq_pt ] ) , we obtain the scalar helmholtz equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 refers to the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath34 , i.e. to the @xmath2-axis , and @xmath35 is @xmath36 hereafter",
    ", the @xmath33 symbol is dropped for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the scattering theory , or its matricial formulation called t - matrix theory , provides an scheme to find analytically the normal modes of a system of scatterers in which waves are described by a helmholtz equation @xcite .",
    "we fulfill the t - matrix theory requirements because our ensemble of @xmath1 loops can be considered a collection of scatterers and the perturbed total pressure is described by equation ( [ helm_eq ] ) .    the t - matrix scheme states that the @xmath4-th flux tube generates an outgoing scattered wave , @xmath37 , in a field position @xmath38 ( in the two - dimensional @xmath5-plane ) that adds to the waves scattered from the other loops to produce the following net external field @xmath39 the scattered wave by the @xmath4-th loop is produced as a response of an exciting wave produced by the external field minus the contribution of the mentioned loop , @xmath40 with equations ( [ net_field ] ) and ( [ excitation_field ] ) the exciting field , @xmath41 , may be written entirely in terms of the scattered field , resulting in the self - consistency field equation .",
    "this system of equations may then be closed by noting that the exciting and scattered fields are further related by linear operators , @xmath42 , that describe the scattering properties of the individual flux tubes @xmath43",
    "the key point is that the linear operators @xmath42 depend exclusively on the individual loop and external medium properties and can be directly computed through the boundary conditions on the loop - external medium interphase as we will see below .",
    "the external field to the @xmath4-th loop can be decomposed with equation ( [ excitation_field ] ) as an excitation field on this loop and a scattered field by this loop .",
    "the excitation field has no sources in the @xmath4-th loop , i.e. it is the scattered field of the other loops , so it can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the expansion coefficients of order @xmath46 , that depend on the @xmath47 wave number and the frequency @xmath27 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the local polar coordinates centered at @xmath50 , defined through @xmath51 and @xmath52 . here",

    "as we will see below with this equation we can find the @xmath45 coefficients and the frequencies @xmath27 , from which the spatial structure of the normal modes can be determined . from equation ( [ problem_solution ] ) , we see that the expansion coefficient of order @xmath46 of the @xmath4-th loop , @xmath45 , is coupled to all expansion coefficients of the other loops .",
    "this fact reflects the collective nature of the normal modes . with the @xmath45 and equations ( [ net_field ] ) and ( [ scattered_field_explicit ] ) we find the net external field .",

    "the bessel functions of the second kind , @xmath66 , are not considered in the expansion of the internal field ( eq.~[[tansmited_field_explicit ] ] ) because they are singular at the loop axes . the transmitted field ( eq.~[[tansmited_field_explicit ] ] )",

    "the zeroes of the denominator correspond to the dispersion relation of the individual loop ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the frequencies of oscillation of these four modes as a function of @xmath96 are displayed in figure [ ratio_densities ] .",

    "the opposite situation takes place when @xmath85 is sufficiently different from @xmath101 : the collective frequencies are closer to the individual kink frequencies and the system behaves as a pair of independently oscillating loops . in this regime ,",

    "the results discussed so far in this subsection correspond to different densities of loops @xmath0 and @xmath110 .",
    "nevertheless , if the densities of loops @xmath0 and @xmath110 are similar , their interaction is more important and the description of the dispersion diagram and the normal modes of the system is much more complex . in this case",
    ", there are eight kinklike normal modes .",
    "in this situation there are not only interactions between pairs of loops but also interactions between three loops .",
    "there are modes associated to the ensemble formed by tubes @xmath0 and @xmath110 , individual oscillations of the cylinder @xmath130 and the ensemble of the three loops depending on @xmath122 .",
    "a particular case of this situation is the three identical loops previously discussed (  [ eq_loops ] ) in which all modes are associated to the collectivity .",
    "in this work we have investigated the kinklike normal modes of a system of several loops with the help of the t - matrix theory .",
    "the results of this work can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in the system of two non - identical loops , we have found four kinklike normal modes @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the frequencies of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 solutions are very similar as well as the frequencies of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 modes .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite , who considered thin tubes ( i.e. long wavelength approximation ) . for fat loops",
    "the @xmath88 and @xmath89 modes , as well the @xmath90 and @xmath91 , have different frequencies , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "2 .   for a system of two loops",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the interaction between kink oscillations as a function on the relative density of the loop pair .",
    "for @xmath84 we have found that the oscillations of the loops are coupled in the range of @xmath85 between @xmath139 to @xmath140 and that the coupling is maximum at @xmath141 . outside this density",
    "range the loops are essentially decoupled and oscillate independently .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the behavior of the anomalous modes described by @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the interaction with the relative radii of the loops .",
    "we have seen that in the range of radii for which transverse loop oscillations have been observed the interaction depends very little on this parameter and the loops strongly interact for all the radii considered .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is that in our loops the thin loop approximation can be applied and in this situation the kink frequency depends on the tube density and not on the radii .",
    "4 .   in the case of a system of three equal , aligned loops",
    "there are eight kinklike normal modes .",
    "the lower frequency mode corresponds to the three loops oscillating in phase in the @xmath94-direction , i.e. along the direction in which their axes are aligned , in agreement with the results of two identical loops . on the other hand",
    ", the upper frequency mode corresponds to the three loops oscillating in phase in the @xmath95-direction .",
    "this does not agree with the two identical loops situation , in which the upper mode corresponds to the two loops oscillating in antiphase in the @xmath94-direction .",
    "in fact , this property of the three - loop system is also true for ensembles of four or more aligned loops .",
    "we have made a parametric study of the kinklike modes in a system of three loops with equal radii and different densities by changing the density of loop @xmath130 , @xmath122 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath84 and @xmath102 so that the interaction between loops @xmath0 and @xmath110 is negligible .",
    "we have found that the oscillations of loop @xmath130 are coupled with loop @xmath110 when @xmath142 , whereas loop @xmath0 oscillates independently .",
    "furthermore , loop @xmath130 couples with loop @xmath0 when @xmath143 with loop @xmath110 oscillating independently .",
    "if @xmath122 takes different values , the system is decoupled and the three loops oscillate independently .    in this work",
    ", we have found that the interaction between loops regarding kinklike motions depends strongly on the their individual kink frequencies .",
    "if these frequencies are similar , loop motions are coupled and the normal modes are collective . on the other hand , if the loop kink frequencies are quite different their motions are not coupled .",
    "since the individual frequencies depend on the loop density and radius , we have studied separately the influence of the two parameters .",
    "we have found that if the densities are quite similar , loops are coupled and the oscillations are collective . on the other hand ,",
    "if the densities are quite different , the tubes oscillate independently .",
    "the range of densities for which the loops are coupled depends on the system properties and in the configuration of three loops this range is narrower than in the two tubes configuration .    from the results shown in this paper we suggest that the antiphase motions reported in @xcite and @xcite are collective motions and , therefore , that the individual kink frequencies are similar but different from the collective observed frequency",
    ". if the loop model presented here is valid , both loop densities are also similar .",
    "in addition , in @xcite a loop arcade is studied and three groups of tubes oscillating with similar frequencies can be appreciated .",
    "the dynamics of each group of tubes can be interpreted as collective , although a detailed study of such configuration is needed to relate the loop characteristics and the frequency of oscillation of the group .",
    "on the other hand , loops not belonging to these three groups do not share their frequencies with other loops , and so oscillate independently .",
    "this has to be interpreted as a sign that these loops have different densities from those of the rest of the loops .",
    "it must be mentioned that in @xcite all the oscillations are assumed as individual , but this is only true in the case of loops that do not share their frequency . if this assumption is applied to loop with a collective behavior it produces wrong results for the loop parameters .",
    "for example , if the loops actually oscillate with the lowest frequency collective mode , the assumption of these authors produces an underestimation of the magnetic field or an overestimation of the loop density .",
    "the t - matrix method shown in this paper can be easily applied to more complex configurations with gas pressure and tubes with flows or more complex systems of loops , i.e. arcades with myriads of loops or multistranded loops .",
    "it is expected that in such systems loops oscillate essentially independently except for loops with similar individual oscillation frequencies .",
