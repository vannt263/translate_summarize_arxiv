    "chemical abundances of gaseous nebulae are among the most frequently used astrophysical tools for measuring the rates of heavy element formation , inferring the history of star formation , and gauging the effects of internal stellar nucleosynthesis and mixing . in this paper",
    "we subject the most common method of measuring heavy element abundances , the `` ionization correction factor '' ( `` @xmath0 '' ) method , to a simple but rigorous examination .",
    "the @xmath0 method was initially developed by torres ",
    "peimbert & peimbert ( 1979 ) as a method for converting measured nebular emission line fluxes into chemical abundances .",
    "the application of the method is straightforward : using standard diagnostic techniques , the electron density , @xmath3 , temperature , @xmath4 , and the ionic abundances ( relative to h@xmath5 ) of species with visible lines ( e.g. he@xmath5 , he@xmath6 , n@xmath5 , o@xmath5 , o@xmath6 , ne@xmath6 , s@xmath5 , s@xmath6 , ar@xmath6 ) are derived from observed line ratios .",
    "total chemical abundances are then derived by correcting the ionic abundances for unseen ionization stages using @xmath0s .",
    "the many untestable assumptions used to formulate these correction factors render them the weakest link in this methodology ; however , the resulting errors have never been stringently assessed .",
    "various statistical studies of nebulae have been used to refine the various correction factors of the @xmath0 method , the latest and most exhaustive study being that of kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) ( hereafter , kb ) .",
    "however , these studies all rely on observations of nebulae whose assumed chemical properties are based on @xmath0 techniques  a somewhat circular process . more recently ,",
    "et  al_.  ( 1996 ) , kwitter & henry ( 1996 ) , and kwitter & henry ( 1997 ) have developed a method in which @xmath0 abundances are only used as a starting point for cloudy models ( see ferland _",
    "et  al_.  1996 or ferland _",
    "et  al_.  1994 for a description of cloudy ) . making certain assumptions about the nebular structure and stellar properties , henry _",
    "al_.  ( 1996 ) vary the input abundances to cloudy until its predicted line ratios match their observed ones .",
    "they find that averaged over the nebula , @xmath0 abundances differ by @xmath7 from those used in their most successful cloudy models .",
    "if this were the entire story then this paper would not have been submitted .",
    "however , balick _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1994 ) observed several planetary nebulae ( pne ) with @xmath8 resolution along a slit .",
    "using the @xmath0 method they derived radial increases in nitrogen abundances as high as a factor of 7 , whereas other elemental abundances remain constant .",
    "in addition , guerrero _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1995 ) have drawn similar conclusions about nitrogen variations in the bipolar nebula m1 - 75 while corradi _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1997 ) found radial increases for helium , neon , sulfur , and argon in their long  slit studies of ic  4406 .",
    "based on such abundance variations with radius some authors have proposed the recent ejection of high  velocity , element  enriched material by the central star . if real , these interpretations suggest some bizarre stellar enrichment process for which no theoretical understanding exists",
    ".    alternately , the @xmath0derived abundance gradients could be erroneous . investigating this possibility is the goal of the present paper .",
    "as we shall see , cloudy simulations show that there are important regions , such as all low  ionization zones , in which the @xmath0 abundances of some elements can be highly discrepant ( a factor of three or more ) .",
    "other total abundances befall similar though less extreme fates .",
    "we denote elements by standard abbreviations , h , he , c , etc .",
    "unless implied otherwise in context , we shall use the following abbreviations for specific emission lines : [ nii ] = [ nii]@xmath96583 , [ oi ] = [ oi]@xmath10 , [ oii ] = [ o ii]@xmath11= [ oii]@xmath12 , [ oiii ] = [ oiii]@xmath13 , [ neiii ] = [ ne iii]@xmath14 , [ ariii ] = [ ariii]@xmath15 , [ ariv ] = [ ariv]@xmath16 , [ arv ] = [ ar v]@xmath17 , [ sii ] = [ s ii]@xmath18 , and [ siii ] = [ s iii]@xmath19 . generally speaking , total abundances are relative to h and ionic abundances are relative to h@xmath5 , so that `` ne '' means the ne / h abundance and `` o@xmath6 '' is equivalent to o@xmath6/h@xmath5 , etc .",
    "`` profile '' implies the radial distribution of some quantity , e.g.  an emission line profile . the electron density , @xmath20 ,",
    "is determined using the 6717  and 6731  lines of s@xmath21 and the electron temperature is determined two ways ; @xmath22 using the [ nii ] 6583 , 6548  and 5755  lines and @xmath23 using the [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007  and 4363   lines using standard methods .    in the present study we used cloudy ( version 90.02 ) in order to conduct a controlled study of @xmath0derived abundances and their sensitivity to changes in nebular conditions such as nebular geometry , stellar temperature , luminosity and emergent spectrum , and abundances .",
    "this procedure bypasses all observational problems ( e.g.  reddening corrections and flux calibrations ) and does not rely on a statistical or empirical analysis of the observations of a heterogeneous sample of observed objects .",
    "based on a set of `` _ assumables _ '' , namely , the chemical abundances @xmath24 relative to h , along with a nebular density structure , @xmath25 , and a standard star model , @xmath26 or @xmath27 , cloudy was used to compute the profiles of the ionization structure , electron density , electron temperature , and the emissivities of bright optical lines .",
    "cloudy s emissivity profiles were summed over different `` apertures '' to synthesize a set of `` _ observables _ '' , i.e.  emission lines fluxes in relatively bright nebular lines .    the original profiles and these observables were normalized to h@xmath28 and then used to determine a set of `` _ derivables _ '' ( denoted with a prime ) from ratios of observable lines  @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and ionic abundances @xmath32  using standard techniques .",
    "the expressions for this process were obtained by fits to output from the ionic and temden tasks in the iraf / stsdas program nebular ( shaw & dufour 1995 ) .",
    "these fits , which are generally accurate to 2% or better , are listed in appendix a. in all cases we used @xmath33 and @xmath23 for computing the abundances of ions emitted from low and high  ionization regions , respectively .",
    "the derived ionic abundances , @xmath32 , were used as input to the @xmath0 method used by kb in order to derive the resultant total abundances @xmath34 . to this end",
    ", the @xmath32 are multiplied by certain @xmath0 corrections , @xmath35 , which are based on geometric assumptions about the relative volumes occupied by the unseen ionization stages .",
    "expressions for the @xmath0 correction factors for various atoms are also listed in the appendix .",
    "finally , the `` discrepancy ratios '' , @xmath36 are computed .",
    "( note that our @xmath37 of henry _",
    "et  al_.  1996 ) .    as an example of this process , in many nebulae the dominant ionization stages of nitrogen",
    "are n@xmath5 and n@xmath6 .",
    "although n@xmath5 emits several bright optical lines ( rendering n@xmath5/h@xmath5 readily measurable ) , n@xmath6 does not .",
    "hence we must estimate n by correcting n@xmath5 with an @xmath0 where @xmath38n@xmath39n@xmath40n@xmath5 , recalling of course that",
    "n is not directly measurable . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0 method assumes that both nitrogen and oxygen have the same ionization structure ; i.e. the fractional ionizations @xmath41n@xmath42o@xmath43 and @xmath41n@xmath44o@xmath45 at all radii .",
    "thus @xmath0(n ) = o / o@xmath5 , where ( o / o@xmath5 ) can be derived from observables , as shown in appendix a. note that no explicit knowledge of the nebular physical conditions or the excitation source is required beyond that needed to determine ionic abundances .    using this technique , an assessment of the global @xmath0 nebular abundances",
    "was made by integrating the line emissivity profiles computed by cloudy over four regions or apertures : the entire model nebula ( truncated where @xmath41h@xmath46 ) ; a `` high - ionization '' region ( in which @xmath41o@xmath47o@xmath48 ) , a `` low - ionization '' region ( in which @xmath41o@xmath49 ) , and a `` neutral '' region ( in which @xmath41o@xmath50 and @xmath41h@xmath51 ) .",
    "the high  ionization region is typical of density  bounded nebulae observed with a large aperture .",
    "the low  ionization and neutral regions are characteristic of low ",
    "ionization features , such as ansae and fliers , commonly found in planetary nebulae .",
    "the computations stop at @xmath41h@xmath52 since the assumptions of ionization and thermal equilibrium become poor at about that point and the use of cloudy is not appropriate .",
    "( even at @xmath41h@xmath53 the detailed results are probably uncertain . )",
    "the procedure was applied to a `` baseline model '' in which the total density is 0 @xmath54 within a radius @xmath55 cm , and 3000 @xmath54 beyond it .",
    "abundances @xmath56h@xmath57he@xmath57c@xmath57n@xmath57o@xmath57ne@xmath57s@xmath57ar@xmath58 were used .",
    "a star with @xmath59 ( erg s@xmath60)and a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath61 ( @xmath62k ) was adopted .",
    "this baseline model is representative of typical bright galactic planetary nebulae such as ngc 3242 and 7662 .",
    "several input parameters were then varied in order to ascertain how the derived abundances @xmath34 and @xmath0 discrepancies @xmath63 are affected .",
    "the parameter variation studies are intended to explore reasonable ranges of structural and chemical conditions .",
    "these parameter variation sets , @xmath64 , are summarized in the left column of table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the @xmath65 sequence probes the effect of nebular geometry through changes in the size of the empty central cavity .",
    "for @xmath64o , @xmath64n , and @xmath64(n+o ) , abundances were varied to determine the extent to which nebular abundances affect the @xmath0 abundance discrepancies .",
    "we computed ten models , @xmath66 ) , in which a `` star '' moves along a typical harman ",
    "seaton sequence in its pn evolution .",
    "that is , a range of stellar uv flux distributions ( assumed to be blackbodies ) and luminosities was considered . for comparison , we also considered seven nonlte models , @xmath67 ) , which were chosen to approximate models from the @xmath68 ) sequence to examine the effects of changes in the shape of the input spectrum .",
    "these nonlte models are interpolations of a set of models from klaus werner ( werner _ et  al_. 1991 ) included in the cloudy package .",
    "the model  computed ionization structure and emission line profiles of the baseline model are shown in the top and center panels of figure  [ fig1 ] , respectively .",
    "the figure is characteristic of nearly all of the model nebulae .",
    "the resulting abundance discrepancies , @xmath69 , are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "shaded regions show the areas integrated for the low  ionization and neutral regions .",
    "note that the differences between the ionization volumes for o@xmath6 and ne@xmath6 and o@xmath21 and n@xmath21 are cross  hatched in the left and right panels , respectively .",
    "the resultant radial profiles of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the ionic abundances @xmath73 are found to be in such close agreement with their `` real '' counterparts computed by cloudy that we need not distinguish between them hereafter .",
    "this agreement is in spite of different atomic constants in the codes used in both methods which only serves to reassure us that the errors in the @xmath0 method are real and measurable .",
    "one exception is the ar@xmath6 abundance determined from the 7136  line for which ionic s results consistently differ from cloudy s computed values by a factor of two .",
    "other exceptions occur , but only in extreme circumstances .",
    "the emission line profiles were integrated over each of the four types of regions ( entire nebula , high  ionization , low  ionization , and neutral ) using both volume and line  of  sight weighting .",
    "these results mimic observations using apertures that isolate and average over the corresponding volumes or lines of sight . from these integrated observables",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath75 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the @xmath0 correction factors , the derived abundances @xmath34 , and @xmath0 abundance discrepancies @xmath63 were derived for each zone separately .",
    "a grid of the line flux ratios integrated over the full nebular volume and corresponding to each of the present model sequences is presented in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the nebular h@xmath28 luminosity and radius for each model ( relative to the baseline ) are tabulated , as are the densities and temperatures that would be derived directly from full  volume integrated emission line ratios .",
    "it is interesting to note how the brightnesses of all of the low  ionization lines increase ( relative to h@xmath28 ) along the harman ",
    "seaton sequence through all ten of the @xmath68 ) models . by the end of this sequence , the [ nii]/h@xmath76 line ratio exceeds 1.5 ( assuming a standard balmer decrement value of 2.8 for the h@xmath76/h@xmath28 line ratio ) . similarly , [ o i]/h@xmath76 approaches 25% .",
    "these are global integrated values , not just local ones near the nebular edge . comparing these resulting flux ratios to shock models",
    ", we note that pure photoionization models can give rise to low  ionization line strengths comparable to many planar shock models with shock velocities @xmath77 km s@xmath60 ( e.g.   hartigan _ et  al_.  1994 ) . within the potential uncertainties of abundances determined with @xmath0 methods , the line ratios in the low  ionization portion of a planetary nebula",
    "can not reliably be distinguished from shock models without additional information .",
    "the h@xmath28 luminosities are relevant for studies of the pn luminosity function . in the case that the nebulae are ionization bounded , these luminosities are insensitive to the assumed nebular geometry or abundances ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . however ,",
    "as expected , they are excellent discriminators of the ultraviolet photon flux of the central star , i.e.  its evolutionary state .    the nebular densities and temperatures in table  [ tbl-1 ] exhibit some curious features . the [ sii ]",
    "lines are weighted in favor of regions that are typically only partially ionized .",
    "consequently @xmath78 underestimates the true nebular electron density ( 3300 @xmath54 in this case ) by more than 20% .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 can differ from @xmath23 by more than 1000 @xmath79k ( @xmath80 ) due to changes in the nebular temperature profile through the n@xmath5 and o@xmath6 regions .",
    "accordingly , observed @xmath33 and @xmath23 can be expected to differ in real nebulae in which no small  scale temperature fluctuations occur ( cf fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the sign of the @xmath4(n@xmath5 ) ",
    "@xmath4(o@xmath6 ) temperature difference reverses at stellar temperatures around 10@xmath81 @xmath79k .    on the one hand ,",
    "abundance errors are exacerbated unless @xmath33 and @xmath23 are used for the computation of low and high  ionization species , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the errors which derive from problems in measuring @xmath29 , @xmath75 and @xmath31 are often small compared to other potential problems which are inherent to the @xmath0 method .",
    "a key assumption in the @xmath0 method is that the ionization structure of n and o ( and hence n@xmath5 and o@xmath5 ) is identical . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , _ these ionization zones are obviously not cospatial ! _ although charge transfer locks o@xmath5 to h@xmath5 , charge transfer is far less important in the ionization structure of n@xmath5 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "hence the ionization structures of n@xmath5 and o@xmath5 are only weakly coupled .",
    "similarly , the ionization fractions he@xmath5 , o@xmath6 , and ne@xmath6 are assumed to be roughly equal in the @xmath0 method . in the cloudy models these deviate from one another , especially near the edge of the high  ionization region . here",
    "too , charge transfer affects o@xmath6 to a greater degree than ne@xmath6 .",
    "these potential errors in the @xmath0 method have long been recognized ( e.g. pquignot _ et  al_.  1978 ) .",
    "the substantive issue in this paper is a quantitative analysis of their effect on @xmath0 abundances , i.e. the magnitude of the discrepancy , @xmath63 .",
    "the results of @xmath63 are summarized in table  [ tbl-2 ] for the @xmath65 and @xmath82 ) sequences of models .",
    "results for the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 sequences show only small departures from those of the baseline model and are not shown .",
    "similarly , the nonlte model atmospheres do nt change the resulting @xmath0 abundances to any great degree .",
    "in general , the new discrepancies differ from the blackbody case by @xmath1 for unresolved nebulae and @xmath86 for resolved observations . in cases where the blackbody abundances were",
    "good ( discrepancies @xmath1 ) the nonlte result tends to differ by @xmath87 .",
    "several interesting conclusions can be drawn from inspection of the table .",
    "the abundances derived for he , n , and o from entire  volume observations ( i.e. , large  aperture observations of ionization bounded nebulae ) are generally good .",
    "a similar result was found by henry _ et  al_.  ( 1996 ) .",
    "s and ar are generally not fitted well ( errors @xmath88 ) with ar systematically overestimated by @xmath88 in volume integrals .",
    "errors for ne can exceed @xmath89 or more and vary greatly with the properties of the central star .",
    "but the apparent accuracy of the @xmath0 method can be deceptive .",
    "note in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the degree to which @xmath90 varies with radius . in a volume  average over the entire nebula , these variations tend to cancel ; however , many of the local values of @xmath90 deviate from unity . in regions of low ionizations",
    "the @xmath0 discrepancies of he , n , ne , and ar often approach 20% , and sometimes even exceed 100% . local @xmath0 abundance discrepancies",
    "are considered in ",
    " 3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "we next consider the abundances derived from observations in which the baseline nebula is spatially resolved .",
    "refer to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the baseline model results shown in table  [ tbl-2 ] . in the outer parts of the nebula where the @xmath0 approximation n / o = n@xmath5/o@xmath5 breaks down , @xmath91n@xmath92 increases from 0.7 in the nebular interior to 2 in the neutral zone .",
    "if the emission lines of the baseline model were observed using a long slit , _ the use of the @xmath0 approximation would lead to the erroneous conclusion that both n / o and n / h increase by a factor of three or more ! _    the abundances determined solely or largely from lines of high ionization , he and ne , also show large discrepancies in low ",
    "ionization regions ; however , unlike [ nii ] , only a small fraction of the helium and neon line fluxes arise outside the high  ionization zone",
    ". therefore the magnitude of the abundance discrepancy will not be noticeable in practice . nonetheless",
    ", @xmath0 abundance errors in he and ne will certainly arise in isolated low  ionization ansae , lobes , or halos .",
    "similarly , the derived abundances of s and ar using only the standard [ sii ] and [ ariii ] lines are affected .",
    "however , their @xmath0 discrepancies can be ameliorated if lines of [ siii ] and [ ariv ] are detected and included in the @xmath0 abundance analysis",
    ".    clearly , except for o , all @xmath0 abundances are vulnerable to large systematic errors with nebular radius , especially in or near the ionization front .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the @xmath0 discrepancies for other models show some interesting trends from region to region . here",
    "we point out only a few of them .",
    "consider first the @xmath65 sequence .",
    "as the radius of the central hole grows and the impinging stellar radiation becomes more dilute ( i.e.  the ionization parameter decreases ) , the relative size of the low  ionization zone grows and the boundary between the high and low ",
    "ionization regions becomes less distinct .",
    "this has a profound effect on abundances measured in the high  ionization zone , as seen in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "hollow pne such as abell 39 and halos such as ngc 6826 , ionized by highly dilute stellar radiation , are likely to be the most affected .",
    "consider the @xmath82 ) sequence .",
    "abundance discrepancies are very sensitive to the assumed temperature of the excitation source , as is easily seen in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the first model in the sequence represents a cool stellar ionizing source , @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the high  ionization zone occupies less than half of the nebular volume , and the boundary between it and the low  ionization zone is not sharply defined . in this transition region",
    "the various @xmath63 s are large . only oxygen , for which both important ionization stages are visible , has a reliably measurable abundance .",
    "this serves as a warning for abundance measurements of h ii regions as well as low ",
    "ionization pne such as ic418 and bd@xmath94 .    as the stellar temperature increases in the sequence the ionization patterns seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are quickly established .",
    "the low  ionization zone becomes smaller in radius , and the lines that are emitted from it drop in overall importance . as a result ,",
    "the abundance discrepancies @xmath63 are closest to unity for the second through fifth models in the sequence .    as the stellar luminosity drops ( seventh through tenth models ) , the low  ionization zone again fills more of the nebular volume . correspondingly , the @xmath63 s increase . as discussed earlier , the emission line ratios of low  ionization species such as o@xmath79 , s@xmath21 , o@xmath21 , n@xmath21 , and ar@xmath6 resemble values found in low  velocity shocks ( hartigan _ et  al_.  1994 ) . at the same time",
    ", high  ionization lines from he@xmath5 , he@xmath6 , o@xmath6 , and ne@xmath6 remain bright . except for oxygen ,",
    "the ionization correction factors become large and the corresponding abundance discrepancies mount .",
    "ionization correction techniques have long been used in both galactic and extra  galactic astronomy . as early as 1985 , bob rubin recognized problems with derived nitrogen abundances .",
    "our work bears out his assertions .",
    "we confirm that as electron temperature drops the ratio n@xmath6/o@xmath6 rises .    while the present models focus on pne , the @xmath0 abundance discrepancies are important for observations of galactic and extragalactic hii regions ( gonzalez  delgado _ et  al_.  1994 , martin 1996 , and storchi  bergmann _ et  al_.  1996 to name only a few recent examples ) .",
    "et  al_.  ( 1996 ) , in their examination of the central regions of agns , assume that @xmath0 assumptions can lead to an under  estimate in the nitrogen abundance of 20% ; however , our results suggest that the discrepancy could be 4050% based on the nebular temperatures and densities that they find .",
    "nitrogen in radiation ",
    "bounded objects like planetary nebulae can be easily overestimated , particularly in lines of sight that largely or exclusively sample the low  ionization portion of the nebula where the n@xmath21 profile extends beyond both those of h@xmath21 and o@xmath21 .",
    "a slit which lies across an ionization  bounded nebula should clearly show a rise in n relative to both o and h due to the form of the @xmath0 for nitrogen .",
    "this effect certainly contributes to the results of balick _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1994 ) and guerrero _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1995 ) , although it is unclear whether or not it can completely account for the reported variation in n / o . similar , although less pronounced , problems with ne and s also exist .",
    "surprisingly , the recent results of corradi _ et  al_.  ( 1997 ) show the expected radial increase in all species _ except _ nitrogen .",
    "these radial abundance discrepancies will be exaggerated for highly extended nebulae such as bipolars in which the flux of radiation striking most of the lobe walls is both dilute and incident at high obliquity ( see the values for the @xmath65 series in table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "since 1967 , peimbert , torres  peimbert and their collaborators have been examining the physical effects of both large and small  scale temperature fluctuations on abundances determined by the @xmath0 method .",
    "recently , peimbert _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1995b ) used emission line temperatures from different elements to attempt to measure the temperature fluctuations in 17 type i pne . to quantify the fluctuations , they measured temperatures for numerous emission lines and compared them to one another .",
    "our work clearly shows that this is not a sound test as the lines originate at different points in the nebula due to different sensitivity to temperatures and densities .",
    "an examination of the temperatures in table  3 of peimbert _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1995b ) shows that roughly half of the objects ( notably including all of the minkowski objects in their sample ) have @xmath95 values that are within the differences that one should expect to measure in a smooth , homogeneous pn with no small  scale temperature fluctuations .",
    "recently , a puzzling factor  of  three  to  five disagreement in the oxygen abundances measured from forbidden and recombination lines has arisen ( liu & danziger 1993 , peimbert _",
    "et  al_.  1993 , liu _",
    "et al_.  1995 , mathis 1995 ) .",
    "the present study shows that o abundances measured using the @xmath0 method are generally accurate to @xmath96 measured globally , and 10% measured with a pencil beam near the nebular center ( before observational errors ) .",
    "thus our results do not resolve this controversy .",
    "the present model results show that use of @xmath0 techniques for abundance analysis for spatially unresolved objects gives results accurate to @xmath97 as found by henry _",
    "et  al_.  ( 1996 ) .",
    "larger discrepancies can occur for some nebular conditions including cool ionization sources or highly dilute incident stellar uv radiation .    for spatially resolved nebulae",
    ", @xmath0 abundance errors can be high locally , especially for n , ne , and ar in or near an ionization front .",
    "these errors have led to probable overestimates of n / o abundance variations in fliers and bipolar pne .",
    "further , the emission line ratios predicted for the low  ionization species in or near ionization fronts in resolved observations resemble those predicted for shocks .",
    "this is the cause of some ambiguity , if not confusion , in the interpretation of line ratios .",
    "the magnitudes of errors in the @xmath0 method differ for nebulae of various sizes and excitation / ionization sources .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 errors depend on the extent to which ionizing photons are absorbed or escape ( i.e.  whether the nebula is ionization or density bounded ) . consequently , statistical studies of abundances in many objects need to account for these types of conditions",
    ".    nebulae excited by stars with @xmath98 have relatively large @xmath0 discrepancies .",
    "our work has concentrated on conditions typical in pne and thus suggests that a detailed study of @xmath0 abundances in galactic and extragalactic hii regions needs to be undertaken in order to assess the veracity of @xmath0derived abundances and gradients in the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the developer of cloudy , gary ferland .",
