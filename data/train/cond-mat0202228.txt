    "in recent years , the field of nonequilibrium surface growth has been investigated using various discrete models and continuous equations@xcite .",
    "the comprehension of nonequilibrium surface growth plays an important role in understanding and controlling many interesting interface processes , such as vapor deposition@xcite , crystal growth@xcite , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe)@xcite , and so on . during the mbe growth process",
    ", the conserved growth condition is applied without defects , such as overhangs and vacancies .",
    "various discrete conserved models for mbe , describing the kinetic properties of this type of surface growth , have been proposed and studied by intensive numerical simulations .",
    "the main purpose of studying discrete models is to measure scaling exponents for the kinetic roughening , which determines the asymptotic behavior of surface growth on a large length scale in a long time limit .",
    "the important result of the kinetic roughening studies is that a large variety of different discrete growth models can be divided into only a few universality classes .",
    "the surface width @xmath2 , which measures the root - mean - square fluctuation of the surface height , scales as w(l , t ) ~l^f(t / l^z ) , where the asymptotic behavior of the scaling function @xmath3 is constant for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the growth is characterized by three exponents : the roughness exponent @xmath8 , the growth exponent @xmath9 , and the dynamical exponent @xmath10 .",
    "these exponents determine the universality class .    in the coarse - grained picture , evolution of the growing surface",
    "is usually described by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) for the height variable @xmath11 as a function of the surface coordinate and time . for discrete models of mbe growth ,",
    "several sdes were suggested and it was generally believed that there is a correspondence between discrete growth models and continuum sdes . the common way of establishing the link between discrete models and continuous equations is a simple comparison of critical exponents determined from computer simulations of the discrete model with exponents for the continuous equation .",
    "there have also been attempts to establish the correspondence in an explicit way .",
    "the systematic procedure for establishing a continuous equation corresponding to discrete models , starting from the master equation in discrete space was proposed by vvedensky _",
    "et al._@xcite and has been successfully applied to the derivation of growth equations for some discrete models , including the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model , the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model , as well as the wolf - villain and das sarma - tamborenea models@xcite .",
    "however , there are several difficulties with this procedure ; in particular , in converting from the equation system for a discrete set of heights to an equation for a continuous function @xmath11 , the procedure requires the regularization step , in which the nonanalytic quantities are expanded and replaced with analytic quantities , i.e. , the step function is approximated by an analytic shifted hyperbolic tangent function expanded in a taylor series .",
    "however , the form of the regularized function is uncertain , and different choices of this function lead to different results .",
    "some forms of the regularized function have been suggested , but the problem of a proper choice of a regularization scheme has not been discussed .    to overcome this kind of uncertainty , the authors proposed a new schematic formalism@xcite , deriving the continuous equations , such as the edwards - wlikinson ( ew)@xcite and kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz)@xcite equations , from the body centered solid - on - solid model and the rsos model . in this paper , we apply our formalism to a new kind of mbe growth model proposed by kim , park , and kim@xcite .",
    "this model allows the deposited particle to relax to the nearest site where the rsos condition on neighboring heights is satisfied and has the conserved growth condition constraint , which means the deposited particles are possible to hop for an infinite distance until they eventually find the site with the rsos condition satisfied .",
    "applying our formalism to the above conserved rsos ( crsos ) model , we not only derive the villain - lai - das sarma ( vld ) equation@xcite for the model which belongs to a different universality class from the ew and kpz equations , but also we are able to predict the coefficients in the vld equation , which was not possible by other methods .    observing that the rsos model belongs to the kpz class and",
    "the crsos model belongs to the vld class , we went one step further to study the rsos model with the finite range hopping ( rsos / h ) . in this rsos / h model",
    ", it is possible for the deposited particles to hop a finite distance @xmath12 until they find the site with the rsos condition satisfied . if they fail to find the site with the rsos condition satisfied within the distance @xmath12 in both directions , the deposition process is rejected .",
    "the rsos model corresponds to the rsos / h model with @xmath13 and to the crsos model with @xmath14 .",
    "we apply our formalism to the rsos / h model with @xmath12 finite and find that this model belongs to the kpz class , contrary to the previous report by kim and yook@xcite , who concluded that there is a phase transition between the kpz class to the vld class along the parameter @xmath12 .    in sec .",
