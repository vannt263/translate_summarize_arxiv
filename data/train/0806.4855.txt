    "entanglement is an essentially new resource for communication that lies at the very heart of quantum information theory . among several other exploits ,",
    "it has been shown to permit information transfer at higher rates than classically expected , thank to the existence of quantum correlations between separated parties @xcite .",
    "thus , a theory of entanglement which offers a qualitative description as well as quantitative measures is highly desirable .    for pure states , a satisfactory theory exists and there are procedures both to detect and quantify the entanglement of a given state . for instance , the _ von neumann entropy _ of any of the reduced density operators gives a measure of the entanglement contained in the whole system , being zero if and only if the state is separable , and is directly related to the _ schmidt decomposition _ of the density operator . for mixed states of dimension",
    "less or equal than 6 , i.e. for @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems , _ positivity under partial transposition _ ( ppt ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for separability @xcite .",
    "however , in the general case , things are more involved , and it has been shown that , for dimension greater than 6 , the problem of checking whether a mixed state is entangled or separable is np - hard @xcite .",
    "thus , one should not expect to find an exact solution to the separability problem .",
    "in the recent years some approximations based on different relaxations of the problem have been suggested .",
    "doherty _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite proposed a test based on nested semidefinite programs to search for symmetric extensions of a given bipartite system , which is a stronger condition for separability than the ppt criterion .",
    "brando and vianna showed that the separability problem can be cast as a robust semidefinite program , which is an np - hard problem , and proposed both probabilistic and deterministic relaxations @xcite .",
    "note that these tests only provide bounds to the certainty of the answer to the question  is the state @xmath3 separable or entangled ? \" , but they do nt offer a quantification of the entanglement contained in @xmath3 .",
    "our method relies on the concept of the _ minimum volume covering ellipsoid _",
    "( also known as the lwner - john ellipsoid ) of a given set of vectors in vector space @xmath4 , isomorphic to the space of density operators of dimension n. we show that , for vectors representing separable bipartite density operators , it is possible to identify this ellipsoid with the boundary of the set of bipartite separable states , up to some accuracy .",
    "interestingly , this approach can be used to estimate the amount of entanglement contained in @xmath3 .    in next section",
    ", we briefly review fundamental issues concerning geometric entanglement measures . in section 3",
    "we introduce our method and apply it to @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems . in section 4 , we show that it allows for detection of bound entanglement .",
    "the study of entanglement from the geometrical point of view offers insightful ways both to detect and to quantify quantum correlations between different systems .",
    "first one is known as _ entanglement witnesses _ ( ew ) , which split the space of states in two parts in such a way that the set of separable states lies strictly inside one of the resulting half - spaces .",
    "we denote the set of all density operators by @xmath5 , and the set of separable states by @xmath6 .",
    "it follows from probability theory that both sets are convex @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be an ew , then :    @xmath8    @xmath9    clearly this defines a hyperplane dividing @xmath5 : @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the inner product for matrices @xmath12 .",
    "this product naturally defines the frobenius norm @xmath13    another measure is the _ hilbert - schmidt distance _ , @xmath14 , of a density operator to the set of separable states @xmath6 :    @xmath15    note that computing @xmath14 involves the obtention of @xmath16 , the projection of @xmath3 onto @xmath6 . an optimal entanglement witness , that is , an ew for which ( [ rho ] ) holds for the largest number of states in @xmath17 , will be tangent to @xmath6 at this point .      any density operator @xmath3 of dimension n can be written in vectorized form :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the unit matrix of dimension n and @xmath20 is some basis of self - adjoint , trace - free matrices , such that :    @xmath21    @xmath22    and @xmath23 is chosen to normalize @xmath24 .",
    "the frobenius norm induces an euclidean norm in @xmath25 . for pure states , @xmath26 , while for mixed states @xmath27 .",
    "this illustrates the convexity of the set of states .",
    "thus , a one - to - one relation between density operators of dimension n and vectors in @xmath25 can been established .",
    "this allows us to switch from the matrix space picture to the real vector space picture , which will prove useful for our method .",
    "it is a general result from geometric optimization that the problem of finding a separating hyperplane between a point @xmath28 and a convex set @xmath29 is dual to the problem of finding the distance between @xmath29 and @xmath28 @xcite . in matrix space language ,",
    "this duality can be illustrated as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath6 be an arbitrary density operator and the set of separable states .",
    "the problem ( [ distance ] ) can be posed as :    @xmath30    with variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the lagrangian of ( [ distance2 ] ) is :    @xmath33    where w is the lagrange multiplicator associated to the equality constraint .",

    "this result , also known as the bertlmann - narnhoffer - thirring theorem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , will let us trace a link between the entanglement detection and quantification problems ( compare also with refs .",
    "the basic premise of our method is that the set of separable states @xmath6 can be approximated by a _",
    "minimum volume covering ellipsoid _",
    "( mvce ) of an ensemble of vectors corresponding to some separable density operators .",
    "then , the following classification scheme can be adopted : if a vector falls inside the mvce , it will be taken as separable , and if it falls outside , it will be regarded as entangled .    an ellipsoid centered at @xmath39 can be expressed as :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a positive definite matrix of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the volume of this ellipsoid is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "since in matrix space quadratic forms are not defined , we need to work in a real vector space to build this ellipsoid .",
    "we first obtain an ensemble of  separable vectors \" by means of tensorially multiplying states along all directions specified by some canonical basis .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath1 case , this ensemble would be @xmath43 .",
    "later on we will see that it is convenient to vary the norm @xmath44 of these vectors .",
    "this procedure ensures that all vectors will lie as spaced as possible in the separable set @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , we minimize the volume of an ellipsoid , constrained to have all generated  separable vectors \" falling inside it . one way to obtain the mvce of this ensemble would be to solve the following problem :    @xmath45    with variables a and @xmath39 . here , logarithm was taken in order to drop off proportionality terms . despite the exponential growth of the dimension of the associated vector space ,",
    "interior point methods used for minimization still converge polynomially to a solution in dimension as large as 1000 , or more @xcite . throughout this work",
    ", we used the disciplined convex programming rule - set implemented in the matlab package cvx @xcite .",
    "+      the separability problem is solved for @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems , thanks to the ppt criterion .",
    "we use this fact to benchmark our method . for a sample of 1000  separable vectors \" and 1000  entangled vectors \" , we solved two different problems : first one is the original problem ( [ distance ] ) casted as :    @xmath46    which gives the true results .",
    "the variable is @xmath32 , and @xmath47 denotes partial transpose in subsystem a. the second problem was to find the mvce through ( [ mvce ] ) , and compute the distance to this ellipsoid in a similar way :    @xmath48    where @xmath24 and @xmath49 stand for the vectorized counterparts of @xmath3 and @xmath32 .",
    "the results obtained for pure vectors ( @xmath50 ) are rather discouraging : whereas none of the generated  separable vectors \" fell outside the mvce , only 12.7% of the  entangled vectors \" were detected .",
    "this led us to shrink our ellipsoid by reducing the norm of the generated ensemble @xmath51 . at the expense of letting some  separable vectors \" fall outside the ellipsoid",
    ", we increase the number of correctly classified  entangled vectors \" .",
    "this recalls a _",
    "binary hypothesis test _ , and we shall adopt the corresponding terminology to expose our results . the event that a true  separable vector \" falls outside the mvce will be a _",
    "false positive _ , while if an  entangled vector \" falls inside the mvce , it will be _ false negative_. stepwise reducing the norm of the vectors belonging to the separable ensemble we obtained tables 1 and 2 .     norm & false positives & false negatives + 0.1 & 962 & 0 + 0.2 & 868 & 0 + 0.3 & 687 & 0 + 0.4 & 484 & 0 + 0.5 & 287 & 15 + 0.6 & 180 & 184 + 0.7 & 92 & 410 + 0.8 & 32 & 600 + 0.9 & 5 & 755 + 1.0 & 0 & 873 +     norm & false positives & false negatives + 0.1 & 949 & 0 + 0.2 & 812 & 0 + 0.3 & 597 & 0 + 0.4 & 427 & 52 + 0.5 & 269 & 196 + 0.6 & 160 & 389 + 0.7 & 80 & 572 + 0.8 & 34 & 699 + 0.9 & 11 & 807 + 1.0 & 0 & 900 +     systems , showing that there exists an area where the probability of wrongly classifying a vector can be brought down to 15.1% , between @xmath52 and @xmath53,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +     systems . the error probability can be reduced to 23.2% , between @xmath53 and @xmath54,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    there is a trade - off between the number of correctly classified states and non - ambiguousness of the test .",
    "the relevant area of @xmath1 systems is between norms @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fnfp22 ] .",
    "a measure of entanglement should be as unambiguous as possible , and thus we argue that the best choice is @xmath53 , since for this case only about 1.5% of the  entangled vectors \" are misclassified . for this choice , in general , a vector will be misclassified 15.1% of the time . for @xmath2 systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fnfp23 ] ) , the mcve approximates somewhat less efficiently the separable set . however , still 76.8% of the vectors are correctly classified , in the area comprised between @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in these systems",
    ", it misclassifies at least 5.2% of the  separable vectors \" .      for a vector space endowed with the euclidean norm",
    ", there is a simple way to construct a tangent hyperplane to a given ellipsoid .",
    "we can use this fact to build realistic observables amenable to a laboratory setting .",
    "the tangent hyperplane to the ellipsoid can be expressed as :    @xmath55_{s_{0}}(\\mathbf{r } - \\mathbf{s}_{0 } ) = 0\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the projection of the vectorized density operator under study onto the mvce .",
    "it can be expressed in affine form as :    @xmath57    ( compare with ref .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , although the hyperplanes introduced in ( [ tangent2 ] ) very much resemble an entanglement witness , they are not so in general .",
    "this is because our mcve may in general be a proper subset of the separable set @xmath6 , and no tangent hyperplane to this mvce will strictly separate @xmath6 from any entangled state .",
    "nevertheless , these _ pseudo_-ew can be used to estimate the amount of entanglement contained in a given entangled matrix @xmath3 via ( [ dualproblem ] ) , which at the optimal value will be equal to ( [ distance2])@xcite . for an illustration of entanglement estimation see fig .",

    "other criteria to detect and quantify be have been proposed , such as non - decomposable ew @xcite , schmidt number witnesses @xcite , and , more recently , a geometric approach based on separating hyperplanes @xcite .",
    "our approach is in the spirit of the latter of the aforementioned methods , but instead of hyperplanes , we shall use the mvce in order to detect be . intuitively , the ellipsoid covering a set of  separable vectors \" should leave bound entangled states on its outside . this fact is studied in 3x3 systems , where a parametrization of bound entangled states , due to p. horodecki , is available @xcite .",

    "[ bedist ]    although , for sufficiently small norms , all be states are detected , one should keep in mind that , in these cases , an unacceptable number of false positives is introduced .",
    "this fact precludes a truly reliable criterion . on top of this",
    ", not all types of be states were tested , so no complete evidence for detection of be is provided .",
    "nevertheless , this gives a quantitative picture to the intuitive idea that , since be states lie outside the separable set , some of them will necessarily be detected by our mvce method .",
    "our method presents some drawbacks .",
    "first important one is ambiguousness , since false positives must be necessarily introduced , to some extent . also , the efficiency of the mvce decreases as @xmath62 as the dimensionality of the problem grows .",
    "this can be compensated reducing the norm of the  separable vectors \" belonging to the generated ensemble .",
    "although the reduction of the norm is geometrically justified , we are still lacking a qualitative physical argumentation , if there is any .",
    "on the other hand , it presents at least two appealing advantages .",
    "interior point methods behave well in very high dimensions , so in principle any discrete quantum system can be accounted for .",
    "for this reason the method is _",
