    "classical thermodynamics does not give us all the details about a nonequilibrium process .",
    "for example consider a nonequilibrium process during which we perform work @xmath1 on a system kept in contact with a heat bath at some fixed temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the system starts from an equilibrium state described by the temperature @xmath2 and some other parameter , say @xmath3 ( e.g. volume ) . during the process",
    "the parameter changes from its initial value @xmath4 to a final value @xmath5 . at the end of the process",
    "the system need not be in equilibrium but will eventually relax to an equilibrium state described by @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "the second law then tells us that w f [ ineq ] where @xmath6 is the difference of free energy between the two equilibrium states .",
    "the equality holds if the process is reversible . for an irreversible process",
    "what other information can one extract from a measurement of the work done ?",
    "first note that for specified initial and final values of the parameter @xmath3 and a fixed path @xmath7 connecting them , the work done will not have a unique value .",
    "every time we repeat the process we will get a different work done because : ( a ) the initial microscopic state we start from may be different and ( b ) for a given initial microscopic state the time evolution is not unique since the system is in contact with a heat bath . thus we will get a probability distribution for the work done and it is of interest to examine the properties of this distribution .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest on issues related to properties of such distribution functions .",
    "two very interesting results involving universal properties of these distributions have been proposed .",
    "the first is a very surprising _ exact equality _ obtained by jarzynski",
    "@xcite which states that : e^-w = e^-f where the average is over the work distribution function .",
    "this result seems to hold very generally and should be compared with the _ inequality _ in eq .",
    "[ ineq ] that one obtains from usual thermodynamics .",
    "the second set of results are obtained when one looks at the probability distribution of various non - equilibrium quantities ( including @xmath1 ) such as , for example , the entropy production . in this case",
    "some new fluctuation theorems have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these theorems were originally derived for deterministic systems but have also been proved for stochastic systems@xcite these theorems look at the ratio of the probabilities of positive to negative entropy production during a nonequilibrium process and thus give some measure of `` second law violations '' which can be significant if one is looking either at small systems or at small time intervals .",
    "there are two versions of the fluctuation theorem , the steady state fluctuation theorem ( ssft ) and the transient fluctuation theorem ( tft ) . in the former case one",
    "looks at a system in a nonequilibrium steady state and the average entropy production rate is examined . in the transient fluctuation theorem",
    "a system is initially prepared in thermal equilibrium and one looks at the entropy produced in a finite time @xmath8 . an important point",
    "to note is that the definition of entropy production in small ( non - thermodynamic ) systems and in a nonequilibrium situation is somewhat ad - hoc and various definitions have been used .",
    "a number of authors @xcitehave looked , both theoretically and in experiments , at fluctuations of quantities such as work , power flux , heat absorbed , etc . during a nonequilibrium process . in an interesting work it was shown by crooks @xcite that the jarzynski equality and the tft are connected .",
    "finding universal properties of various nonequilibrium distribution functions is of obvious interest . at the same time",
    "the explicit forms of the distributions for different systems is clearly of interest too .",
    "infact for systems such as polymers these are experimentally accessible @xcite and it seems plausible that they can give information on the dynamics of the system . there has not been much work in this direction . in a recent paper @xcite speck and seifert",
    "have shown that in the limit of slow driving the work distribution becomes a gaussian .",
    "they consider systems ( which could be nonlinear ) evolving through langevin dynamics .",
    "apart from this work , most other explicit calculations of nonequilibrium distribution functions have considered single particle systems .    in this paper",
    "we consider the well - known model of a flexible polymer whose motion is governed by rouse dynamics .",
    "we look at the work done when the polymer is stretched at a finite rate .",
    "the work distribution functions in different ensembles ( constant force and constant extension ) are computed explicitly and the dependence of the distributions on switching rates and system sizes is examined .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of jarzynski s equality and the fluctuation theorems ( tft ) .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional gaussian polymer whose energy is given by : @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 which is a specified function of time . for the moment we take the spring constants @xmath12 to be arbitrary .",
    "we assume the following rouse dynamics for the chain : @xmath13 which can be written in matrix notation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the noise satisfies @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 is tridiagonal with elements @xmath21 .",
    "the general solution of this equation is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",

    "the parameter values are chosen so that the change in equilibrium free energy given by @xmath50 is of the order of @xmath51 .",

    "next we compute the work distribution in the constant - force ensemble . instead of constraining the end of the polymer",
    "we apply a time - dependent force @xmath56 on it .",

    "in this case we note that the the generalized work @xmath58 , as defined by jarzynski , is given by @xmath59 and is not equal to the true mechanical work done on the system which is @xmath60 . in this paper",
    "we will compute the distribution of the true mechanical work @xmath1 .",
    "we again find that @xmath1 has a gaussian distribution with the following mean and variance : w = _ 0^dt",

    "h^t(t ) & & + ( t - t ) h(t ) for @xmath61 , we get @xmath62 which means that @xmath63 satisfies the fluctuation theorem .",
    "it is then natural to again ask if @xmath1 is some measure of entropy production .",
    "if this was so then @xmath1 should vanish for an adiabatic process . to check this we first express @xmath64 in terms of the rate @xmath65 .",
    "we get w = [ h^t ( ) ^-1 h()-h^t(0 ) ^-1 h(0 ) ] & & + -h^t ( ) _ 0^dt ^-1 ( - t ) ( t ) + _ 0^dt _ 0^t dt ^t(t ) & & + ^-1 ( t - t)(t )  & & hence for an adiabatic process we get @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the polymer free energy in the constant force ensemble .",
    "thus in this case @xmath68 _ is not zero _ for an adiabatic process and so it is not an obvious measure of entropy production _ even though it does satisfy the fluctuation theorem_.    interestingly , since @xmath69 , thus even for an adiabatic process , the work - distribution _ does not tend _ to a @xmath70 function as one might naively expect . however in the thermodynamic limit @xmath71 the width approaches zero as @xmath72 so in this limit the usual expectation is indeed satisfied .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we have computed explicitly the distribution of work done when a polymer is stretched at a finite rate .",
    "we examine different ensembles and look at different definitions of work . as has been noted by earlier authors , for different definitions of the work , the corresponding distributions can have quite different properties . in the constant extension ensemble the generalized work @xmath58 is the same as the true mechanical work @xmath1 and jarzynski s identity is satisfied . in this case , the fluctuation theorem is satisfied by a different quantity @xmath37 which does seem like a quantity which gives some measure of entropy production . in the constant force ensemble , @xmath58 is different from the true work @xmath1 which does not satisfy the jarzynski identity . on the other hand",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 satisfies a fluctuation - theorem like relation . however in this case we find that it is not possible to identify the work as a measure of entropy production .    as a practical use , the jarzynski identity has been proposed as an efficient method for computing equilibrium free energy profiles from nonequilibrium measurements , both in simulations and experiments @xcite . for the specicific case of polymers",
    ", we expect that a combination of simulations and our exact results on the work distribution , should lead to better estimates on efficiency and of errors @xcite ( and how they depend on rates and system sizes ) involved while using the nonequilibrium methods in free energy computations .    for non - gaussian models of polymers such as , for example , semiflexible polymers ,",
    "the work distribution function is likely to be non - gaussian . for small pulling rates",
