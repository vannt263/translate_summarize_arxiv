    "such a study has only recently been presented in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper , we report on both cathodoluminescence ( cl ) and micro - photoluminescence ( @xmath0pl ) measurements on single nws from the sample characterized in ref .   to learn more about the mechanism governing the observed green luminescence band .",

    "these values seem appropriate also for ( in , ga)n , as the values of @xmath16 for gan and inn differ less than those for gan between different theoretical and experimental studies.@xcite figure  [ fig : fem ] shows that there is a considerable piezoelectric polarization in the ( in , ga)n insertions . in the center of the insertion , @xmath6",

    "as these authors observe luminescence from localization centers , our much longer lifetimes suggest a transition where the wave - function overlap is significantly reduced , consistent with our belief that the emission originates from a spatially indirect inter - well transition . for the present sample , the long decay time alone thus does not provide evidence for the presence of electric fields . however , we observe that the decay becomes faster with increasing excitation density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trpl ] ) . such a behavior would not be expected for a transition being merely spatially indirect , but may very well be caused by a progressive screening of electrostatic fields .",
    "note that the carrier sheet density giving rise to @xmath21  c / m@xmath13 is @xmath22  @xmath23 and therefore close to the maximum excitation density @xmath17 ( _ cf . _  fig .",

    "figure [ fig : trpl3 ] displays this pl transient on a double - logarithmic scale . clearly , the decay essentially follows a power - law .",
    "this dependence is characteristic for disordered systems in general@xcite and for ( in , ga)n in particular.@xcite regardless of the details , the interpretation of this peculiar decay type always relies on a spatial separation of charge carriers induced by the individual localization of electrons and holes in separate potential minima .",
    "recombination is _ not _ excitonic in this case , but occurs between electrons and holes with varying spatial separation .",

    "their lateral separation will not influence the transition energy , but the overlap .",
    "energy as well as overlap will depend sensitively on carrier density due to both a saturation of low - energy states and a screening of the internal fields at high excitation density .",

    "at the same time , the ( in , ga)n band exhibits a significant blue - shift with increasing excitation density .",
    "note that the spectra are basically _ rigidly _ blue - shifted , with little symmetric broadening and no asymmetric broadening towards higher energies except for the highest excitation density .",
    "also note that the low - energy tails of the spectra are parallel to each other .",
    "these findings rule out band filling as the cause of the blue - shift , render the saturation of low - energy localized states unlikely , and thus leave the progressive screening of internal electrostatic fields as the most likely cause of the blue - shift observed.@xcite to further confirm this conclusion , we performed power - dependent measurements for eight different single nws as shown in fig .",

    "the magnitude of the peak shift is very similar for all investigated nws .",
    "looking at the more detailed measurement highlighted in this semi - logarithmic plot , it is clear that the dependence is weaker than logarithmic .",
    "this peculiar dependence follows the behavior predicted by @xcite and by @xcite for free carrier screening of the qcse .",
    "the saturation of the peak shift with excitation density simply arises from the fact that the lifetime decreases once screening is effective , thus requiring disproportionately higher excitation densities to further increase the carrier density .",
    "contrary to expectation,@xcite we do not observe a saturation of the transition energy for low excitation densities .",
    "we believe this finding to be a consequence of the very long carrier lifetime and the resulting high carrier densities for cw excitation . at the same time , this high carrier density even for our lowest excitation density is probably also responsible for the lack of any fine - structure in the spectra due to individual localized states , which we would otherwise expect to emerge in single - wire spectroscopy .",

    "an example of such a spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plsingle2 ] .",
    "the positions of these sharp pl peaks are insensitive to the excitation density as emphasized by the vertical lines .",
    "this fact and their small fwhm of down to 36  mev are fingerprints of zero - dimensional localized states .",
    "in fact , localized states originating from compositional fluctuations are known to manifest themselves in spectrally narrow transitions in planar ( in , ga)n / gan qws when measured using nano - apertures@xcite as well as in ( in , ga)n / gan nw heterostructures.@xcite    provided that the spatial extent of the associated potential minima is on the order of one nm , the resulting localized states facilitate spatially direct transitions and are thus not affected by the polarization field .",
    "note that these direct transitions are related to localized _ excitons _ , in contrast to the individually localized electrons and holes discussed above .",
    "taking into account the strong confinement in the nm - scale potential minima , the energy of the corresponding localized states would be only slightly below that of the surrounding ( in , ga)n matrix , which was measured to have an in content of 0.2 . according to the in@xmath1ga@xmath2n band gap ( neglecting excitonic effects ) of @xmath25 with the parameters taken from ref .",
    "corrected for temperature , this in content corresponds to an energy of 2.67  ev , i.e. , right at the high energy cutoff of the sharp lines visible in fig .",

    ", the inter - well transition appears in all nws , while strong exciton localization within one insertion occurs in most but not all nws .",
    "our results show that both the qcse and localization play an important role in the ( in , ga)n / gan nw heterostructure under investigation .",
    "we believe , however , that our results are of significance for ( in , ga)n / gan nw heterostructures in general .",
    "in fact , ( in , ga)n insertions of about 10  nm thickness being embedded within the gan nw are evident from the tem images presented in at least two other studies.@xcite our fem simulations reveal the elastic relaxation of such structures to be marginal , causing strong piezoelectric fields to reside within the insertions .",
    "the associated drastic decrease of the electron - hole overlap renders a regular qw transition unlikely .",
    "in fact , the green ( in , ga)n band seen in the present work is a result of an _",
    "inter - well _ transition due to the two closely spaced insertions , enabling us to experimentally observe the qcse .",
    "moreover , three - dimensional band - structure calculations for ( in , ga)n segments in nws presented recently by @xcite conclusively show that the elastic relaxation may even result in a complete _ lateral _ separation of electrons and holes , inhibiting recombination entirely . in light of these complications ,",
    "emission from strongly localized states is a likely candidate for the luminescence observed from these structures .",
    "in particular , we have shown in the present work that emission energy of strongly localized excitons may be entirely insensitive to excitation density even in the presence of a strong electrostatic field .",
    "the absence of an excitation - dependent blue - shift observed by other groups@xcite thus may be due to localization and not to an absence of polarization fields .",
