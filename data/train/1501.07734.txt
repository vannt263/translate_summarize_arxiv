    "interstellar magnetic field plays significant roles on the dynamics of molecular clouds .",
    "magnetic field supports molecular cloud against gravitational collapse if it is strong enough .",
    "it is well known that the mass to flux ratio , i.e. , the amount of gas contained in a magnetic flux tube , is the key parameter for the magnetic support .",
    "@xcite pointed out from the viral analysis that magnetic force reduces gravity by a constant factor independent of the size of the cloud .",
    "they evaluated the critical magnetic flux to support a cloud of mass , @xmath1 , to be @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the virial theorem provides the correct scaling law but not quantitatively correct value for the critical mass .",
    "one needs equilibrium models to evaluate the critical value .",
    "@xcite for the first time obtained a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium for a disk like cloud supported in part by magnetic field .",
    "he evaluated magnetic pressure and tension as well as self - gravity and gas pressure consistently .",
    "he confirmed that the mass to flux ratio is one of the key parameters .",
    "he also noticed that the equilibrium depends also on ratio of the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure and the flux function , i.e. , the amount of gas contained in each magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite obtained a fitting formula for the critical equilibrium from their numerical results .",
    "it reads @xmath5 .",
    "finite electrical conductivity changes the flux function through ambipolar diffusion and induces quasi - static contraction . when the magnetic field is weaker than the critical one , the gravitational collapse continues to form stars .",
    "thus magnetohydrostatic equilibria help our understanding of the gravitational collapse to form stars .",
    "magnetohydrostatic equilibria depend on the configuration .",
    "we need to consider filamentary clouds in magnetohydrostatic equilibria since observed molecular clouds are often filamentary and associated with either longitudinal or perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is parallel to elongation of the molecular cloud in the ophiuchus star forming region while it is perpendicular in the taurus ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the musca @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite obtained equilibrium model having the density distribution , @xmath6 for an isothermal filamentary cloud in the cylindrical coordinate , ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 and @xmath3 denote the isothermal sound speed and gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the line density defined by @xmath9 does not depend on the filament width , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , this model is neutrally stable against radial contraction .",
    "@xcite showed that filamentary clouds having a larger line density can be sustained by purely longitudinal or partially helical magnetic field .",
    "these models are unstable against fragmentation , i.e. , sinusoidal perturbation in the @xmath11-direction ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fragmentation and its further evolution were studied extensively by @xcite , @xcite and others .    on the contrary , filamentary clouds permeated by magnetic field perpendicular to the axis",
    "have been studied little .",
    "its structure was obtained only recently by @xcite referred to paper i in the following .",
    "this is mainly because the structure is obtained only by extensive numerical computation solving the poisson and grad - shafranov equations simultaneously .",
    "the latter is highly nonlinear since it describes force balance in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "it requires high spatial resolution especially when the filamentary cloud is condensed .",
    "paper i showed that the maximum line density increases in proportion to the magnetic flux . in this paper",
    "we show analytical models which reproduce the main features of the 2d models obtained in paper i.    when the line density is higher than @xmath12 and thus supported mainly by magnetic field , the filamentary cloud is flattened like italian pasta fettucine .",
    "the magnetic force is dominated by the magnetic tension .",
    "then we can use the thin disk approximation to analyze the structure and stability of filamentary cloud permeated by perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we derive an analytical model for an isolated filamentary cloud .",
    "the mass to flux ratio is uniform in the model . in ",
    "3 we use the fourier series for filamentary clouds arranged periodically .",
    "it is shown that the solution approaches to that obtained in  2 when the filament thickness is much smaller than the distance to the neighboring filaments .",
    "it is also shown that the ratio of the thickness to the distance can be regarded as the model parameter specifying the quasi - static evolution . in ",
    "4 we confirm that our 1d models reproduce the main features of the 2d model obtained in paper i. in  5 the model obtained in  2 is proved to be unstable against fragmentation . in  6 we discuss the stability of the models obtained in  3 .",
    "in this paper , we consider an isothermal flattened filamentary cloud having infinite length and infinitesimal thickness .",
    "this simplification is justified for observed filamentary clouds since their lengths are much larger than the widths and the magnetic fields are often perpendicular to cloud elongation on the sky . it is well known that self - gravitating clouds are flattened in the direction perpendicular to the global magnetic field . in the following we use the cartesian coordinates in which the cloud is confined in the plane of @xmath13 and elongated in the @xmath14-direction .",
    "both the gas and magnetic fields are uniform in the @xmath14-direction .    from the above assumptions we can express the gas density distribution as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the surface density and the dirac s delta function , respectively .",
    "the poisson equation reduces to @xmath18 we obtain the boundary condition , @xmath19 by integrating equation ( [ poisson ] ) in the vertical direction over the infinitesimal interval around @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for the derivation ) .",

    "the condition for magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium requires that the magnetic field should be force free and hence current free outside the disk , @xmath23 since both the gravity and pressure thereof are negligibly small .",
    "the symbols , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , denote the speed of light and the electric surface current running in the @xmath14-direction inside the cloud per unit length in the @xmath22-direction , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field is kinked on the disk , @xmath26    note that the gravity and magnetic field can be perfectly aligned outside the cloud .",
    "both of them are divergence and rotation free , i.e. , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , outside the cloud , @xmath31 . in the following we focus on the case that the magnetic field is proportional to the gravity , @xmath32 in @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes a non - dimensional constant .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the constant mass to flux ratio ( isopedic in the terminology of * ? ? ?",

    "( [ criticalb ] ) ) , we can not construct an equilibrium model .",
    "when it is close to the critical value , the mass to flux ratio is nearly constant also outside the cloud as in the model shown in  2 .",

    "differences in the numerical factors come from the assumptions used . in this paper",
    "we neglected the finite thickness of the cloud and hence pressure force acting in the @xmath11-direction for simplicity .",
    "thus the critical line density is evaluated to be @xmath120 in case of no magnetic field ( @xmath121 ) in this paper while it should be @xmath12 in paper i. another difference comes from the assumed mass to flux ratio ; it is uniform in the model shown in  2 while it is not in paper i.    the following equation , @xmath122 was derived from equation ( 45 ) of paper i as well as equation ( [ lined ] ) is derived from equation ( [ filament ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ tomisaka46 ] ) has an asymptotic form , @xmath123 which resembles equation ( 38 ) of paper i , @xmath124 equation ( [ tomisaka38 ] ) is useful since it provides an upper limit on the line density supported against gravity by magnetic field and gas pressure . the upper limit increases in proportion to the magnetic flux contained in the cloud .",

    "the right panel of figure [ type1 ] shows that obtained by applying type ii trial function in which the values of @xmath194 are taken to be @xmath195 .",
    "our model filamentary clouds are unstable against fragmentation as well as the filamentary clouds threaded by longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "the most unstable mode has the wave number , @xmath196 , and the growth rate , @xmath197 , irrespectively of @xmath46 .",
    "as shown in the previous sections , our 1d model based on the thin disk approximation reproduces the main features of 2d model shown in paper i. the maximum mass sustained by magnetic field is roughly proportional to the magnetic flux .",
    "the critical mass to flux ratio depends on the mass loading , i.e. , the distribution of @xmath198 . when the mass loading is uniform ( @xmath199 const . ) , it is slightly larger than @xmath200 . the same critical ratio is obtained for disks in equilibrium and slabs stable against fragmentation .",
    "remember that @xcite obtained a similar value from the viral analysis on the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the critical ratio seems to depend little on the cloud geometry .",
    "remember that filamentary clouds with a longitudinal field are unstable against fragmentation even if the magnetic field is very strong .",
    "the instability is due to the fact that the mass to flux ratio is infinitely large since the clouds are highly extended in the direction of magnetic field .    given the critical mass to flux ratio depends little on the cloud geometry , then it can be applied to the stability of periodically arranged filamentary clouds .",
    "they are almost isolated each other in the limit of @xmath88 .",
    "thus they are unstable against fragmentation as well as the isolated filamentary clouds since the mass to flux ratio is larger than the critical value at the cloud center ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "when @xmath113 , our 1d model reduces to a slab of which stability was already investigated by @xcite .",
    "the slab is stable as far as @xmath202 . in short",
    "the models shown in figure [ sc_ratio ] are stable / unstable for small / large value of @xmath203 .",
    "we surmise that the models of @xmath204 are stable against fragmentation .",
    "most of the 2d models shown in figure [ sc_ratio2d ] are also likely to be stable against fragmentation since @xmath205 .",
    "the above argument brings us an interesting result .",
    "filamentary clouds supported by longitudinal magnetic fields are unstable against fragmentation while those supported by perpendicular fields can be stable .",
    "the latter can collapse quasi - statically through ambipolar diffusion , while the former can not .",
    "our models are still idealistic since turbulence and other dynamical effects are not taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , they provide physical insights on the dynamics of filamentary clouds .",
    "filamentary clouds with perpendicular magnetic field are likely to be able to sustain their forms as far as they are subcritical at the cloud center .",
    "they may fragment after the mass to flux ratio exceeds the critical value by ambipolar diffusion or by mass accretion along the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by jsps kakenhi grant number 24540226 .",
    "we used the mathematical formula , @xmath206 for @xmath207 in order to derive equation ( [ period1 ] ) from equations ( [ psigma ] ) and ( [ seriesa ] ) .",
    "the gravitational potential , @xmath56 , and the @xmath14-component of the vector potential , @xmath208 , are expressed as @xmath209 , \\\\ a _ y & = & \\frac{\\phi x}{\\ell } + \\sum _ { n=1 } ^\\infty   \\frac{\\phi}{\\pi n } \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi n x}{\\ell } \\exp \\left [ - n \\left ( w + \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\ell } |z|",
    "\\right ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , for the solution specified by equations ( [ period1 ] ) through ( [ period3 ] ) .",
    "they are also expressed as @xmath210 , \\\\ a _ y & = & \\frac{\\phi}{\\pi } \\tan ^{-1 } \\left [ \\frac{\\tan \\left ( \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi x}{\\ell } \\right ) } { \\tanh \\left ( \\displaystyle \\frac{w}{2 } + \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi |z|}{\\ell } \\right ) }   \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , since @xmath211 for @xmath212 .",
    "for a given @xmath213 we obtain @xmath179 and @xmath181 by the following procedure .",
    "first we rewrite equations ( [ xix2 ] ) and ( [ irrotational ] ) as @xmath214 we consider the case in which @xmath213 and @xmath215 are symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "this choice is rational since the unperturbed state is symmetric and we are interested in the gravitational instability .",
    "an eigenmode perturbation should be either symmetric or antisymmetric and the fragmentation of a filamentary cloud is symmetric with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "thus we obtain the boundary condition , @xmath176 at @xmath106 .",
    "we assume that the displacement diminishes in the form , @xmath216 in the limit of @xmath217 .",
    "this choice is based on the fact that the relative change in the surface density is proportional to @xmath218 in the limit .",
    "equations ( [ asympto ] ) and ( [ asympto2 ] ) are valid also when @xmath219 decreases more steeply with increase in @xmath22 .",
    "we integrate equations ( [ per6 ] ) and ( [ per7 ] ) from @xmath106 to @xmath220 with stepsize @xmath221 by the 4th order runge - kutta method to obtain two sets of solutions .",
    "one has initial condition @xmath222 .",
    "the other is the solution of equations ( [ per6 ] ) and ( [ per7 ] ) without the source term , i.e. , the homogenous one and has the initial condition @xmath223 .",
    "we obtain the solution satisfying the boundary conditions at @xmath106 and @xmath224 as a linear combination of them .",
    "the outer boundary is set at @xmath225 .",
    "the @xmath14-component of the displacement , @xmath226 , is derived from equation ( [ irrotational ] ) .",
    "now we can evaluate the right hand side of equation ( [ var2 ] ) for a given @xmath178 .",
    "consequently the growth rate is evaluated to be a function of @xmath227 in type i trial function .",
    "we searched for @xmath227 which maximizes the growth rate in the interval of @xmath228 with the interval @xmath229 .",
    "both the denominator and delimiter of the right hand side of equation ( [ var2 ] ) are the quadratic expressions of @xmath230 , when type ii trial function is used .",
    "we used lapack , a mathematical library for linear algebra installed in idl , the interactive data language , for minimizing @xmath188 .",
