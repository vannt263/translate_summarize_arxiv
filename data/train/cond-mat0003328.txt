    "the question of how linear polymers behave in a disordered medium has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "the problem is not only interesting from a theoretical point of view , but may also be relevant for understanding transport properties of polymeric chains in porous media , such as in enhanced oil recovery , gel electrophoresis , gel permeation chromatography , etc.@xcite . in this context , it is useful to learn about the static or conformational properties of linear chains , modelled by self - avoiding walks ( _ saw_s ) , in the presence of quenched disorder , e.g.  how the surrounding structural disorder influences their spatial configuration . as a quite general model of a random medium ,",
    "percolation   may be considered as the paradigm for a broad class of disordered systems and has therefore been mostly used so far .",

    "_ all _ _ saw _ configurations on a given cluster are taken into account , but only relatively short chains can be evaluated . in a mc simulation , longer chains can be studied , but inherently the ensemble of configurations remains incomplete .",
    "here , we use the ee technique in combination with an appropriate finite - size scaling procedure to determine the relevant exponents .",
    "since ` infinitely ' long chains can only exist on the backbone of the cluster , where dangling ends are absent on all length scales , we study the _ saw_s directly on the backbone .",
    "this enables us to generate longer chains on a given cluster and to average over a larger set of different cluster configurations .    specifically , we enumerate all possible _ saw _ configurations of @xmath1 steps for a single backbone and study different moments of the total number of _ saw_s and of their end - to - end distance by averaging over many different backbone configurations .",
    "our analysis shows that the critical exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 do not depend on the order @xmath2 of the moments , while the enhancement exponents and the effective coordination numbers do depend on @xmath2 , leading to multifractal behavior .",
