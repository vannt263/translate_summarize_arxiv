    "the peculiar nature of electrons in a half - filled landau level , and anomalies in the normal state transport properties of the high - temperature cuprate superconductors , have stimulated great interest in systems of strongly interacting fermions moving in spatial dimensions greater than one .",
    "in addition to methods such as mean - field theory@xcite , rpa@xcite and 1/n perturbation theory@xcite , a number of non - perturbative theoretical tools such as the renormalization group,@xcite the eikonal approximation,@xcite and ward identities@xcite have been used to study fermion liquids .",
    "bosonization@xcite is another powerful tool for understanding the effects of both regular and singular interactions on fermion liquids as the realm in which it is applicable , for low - energy excitations near the fermi surface , is precisely where these interactions are most important .",
    "bosonization does not rely upon a fermi liquid form for the quasiparticle propagator ; consequently non - trivial zero temperature quantum critical fixed points are accessible . in an appropriate limit , bosonization reduces complicated many - body hamiltonians to quadratic forms which possess infinite @xmath6 symmetry and which can be diagonalized exactly .",
    "a general theory of fermion liquids in two and three spatial dimensions requires the consideration of a variety of fermi surface geometries and interactions . in this paper",
    "we study only the simplest fermi surface geometries : a circle in spatial dimension @xmath7 or a sphere in @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the symmetries of these surfaces do not break spontaneously when the interactions between fermions are turned on .",
    "the bosonization formalism applies , without significant modification , to more complicated fermi surfaces provided there are no van hove singularities and nesting does not occur .",
    "however , the added technical complications of describing these more complicated surfaces would make detailed discussion of their properties cumbersome and , given this caveat , would not lead to any qualitative changes in the physics .",
    "we do consider a variety of two - body interactions between the fermions . in accord with expectations , we find , barring superconducting instabilities , that short - range and coulomb interactions do not destroy the landau fixed point .",
    "novel fixed points are found , however , in the cases of super - long range interactions and transverse gauge interactions .",
    "the latter case is particularly significant as gauge fields play an important role in the physics of the half - filled landau level@xcite and may be important in the cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "the effects of transverse gauge fields , which are not screened , are particularly interesting as perturbative expansions in the coupling constant break down@xcite .",
    "earlier work on multidimensional bosonization showed that it is an accurate calculational framework for understanding landau fermi liquids@xcite . here",
    "we address the question of whether the approximations inherent in bosonization are adequate for the method to apply to a wider range of fermion liquids with singular or transverse gauge interactions .",
    "three questions in particular must be answered in order to check that bosonization does not break down .",
    "first , the assumed current algebra must be consistent : it is derived for the free system , and it must continue to hold when interactions are turned on .",
    "second , we examine whether or not the neglect of quadratic terms in the fermion quasiparticle spectrum due to fermi surface curvature is an innocuous approximation .",
    "finally , we need to check whether certain vertex corrections are significant by returning to the fermion basis to examine their contribution . in this paper , we examine systems which meet all three of the above conditions .",
    "the fixed points of these systems therefore can be accessed and studied via bosonization .",

    "[ sec : longit ] , we demonstrate how to incorporate any two - body density - density interaction by introducing longitudinal gauge fields which mediate the interaction . as examples , we reproduce the luttinger liquid in one spatial dimension and solve the problem of a single , but general , landau parameter @xmath9 in two and three spatial dimensions .",
    "in appendix a we use the numerical method of fast - fourier - transforms ( fft ) to extract the spectral function of a two - dimensional fermi liquid with landau parameter @xmath10 . and in appendix",
    "b we present details of our solution for more complicated landau parameters .",
    "then we turn to the problem of long - range longitudinal interactions .",
    "we show that screening of the coulomb interaction occurs naturally within the bosonization framework . by considering fermions with spin ,",
    "we show that spin - charge separation does not occur in @xmath11 . in the case of super - long range interactions in @xmath12 ,",

    "<S> we develop a general theory of fermion liquids in spatial dimensions greater than one . </S>",
    "<S> the principal method , bosonization , is applied to the cases of short and long range longitudinal interactions , and to transverse gauge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> all the correlation functions of the system may be obtained with the use of a generating functional . </S>",
    "<S> short - range and coulomb interactions do not destroy the landau fermi fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> novel fixed points are found , however , in the cases of a super - long range longitudinal interaction in two dimensions and transverse gauge interactions in two and three spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider in some detail the 2 + 1-dimensional problem of a chern - simons gauge action combined with a longitudinal two - body interaction @xmath0 which controls the density , and hence gauge , fluctuations . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gauge interaction is irrelevant and the landau fixed point is stable , while for @xmath2 the interaction is relevant and the fixed point can not be accessed by bosonization . </S>",
    "<S> of special importance is the case @xmath3 ( coulomb interaction ) which describes the halperin - lee - read theory of the half - filled landau level . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the full quasiparticle propagator which is of a marginal fermi liquid form . using ward identities , </S>",
    "<S> we show that neither the inclusion of nonlinear terms in the fermion dispersion , nor vertex corrections , alters our results : the fixed point is accessible by bosonization . </S>",
    "<S> as the two - point fermion green s function is not gauge invariant , we also investigate the gauge - invariant density response function . near momentum @xmath4 , in addition to the kohn anomaly we find singular behavior . in appendices we present a numerical calculation of the spectral function for a fermi liquid with landau parameter @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how kohn s theorem is satisfied within the bosonization framework .    </S>",
