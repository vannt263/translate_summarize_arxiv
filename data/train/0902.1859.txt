    "bardeen and wagoner @xcite observed in numerical tests in 1971 that the quadrupole moment of a rigidly rotating disk of dust is always greater than that of the kerr metric with the same angular momentum and mass except in the extreme relativistic case , when they become the same , @xmath0    as already concluded by bardeen and wagoner , the general expectation is that this also holds for other spacetimes containing a central rigidly rotating perfect fluid .",
    "the recent work of bradley and fodor @xcite lends support for this in the slowly rotating case .",
    "it is now interesting to ask the question whether this holds not only for the quadrupole moment but for every moment , @xmath1 in this paper , based upon @xcite , we will formulate this conjecture and collect evidence in favor of it from numerical and analytical results .",
    "we will make use of geometrical units with @xmath2 .",
    "the multipole moments calculated by fodor et al . in @xcite are equivalent to the invariantly defined ones by geroch and hansen @xcite for axially symmetric and stationary spacetimes . because of the form of the ernst potential on the axis , the mass- and rotation moments are in this context given by @xmath3 in accordance with relation ( [ eq : q - equation ] ) we state :    * generalized quadrupole - conjecture . * _ for axially symmetric , stationary and asymptotically flat spacetimes with angular momentum @xmath4 , mass @xmath5 and multipole moment @xmath6 @xmath7 always holds if the spacetime is that of a rigidly rotating perfect fluid body in equilibrium , surrounded by vacuum . _    furthermore , in accordance with our experience , the equality is only reached in the case of a black hole limit , which is then necessarily an extreme kerr black hole , see @xcite . in general , the exterior spacetime differs from the kerr metric .",
    "in the newtonian limit , a rigidly rotating object has angular momentum @xmath8 with moment of inertia @xmath9 and angular velocity @xmath10 . in this limit",
    "we can compute a kinetic energy and define a characteristic velocity via @xmath11 restricting ourselves to axial and equatorial symmetry , relation ( [ eq : gen.eq .",
    "] ) becomes for @xmath12 @xmath13 which should always hold under the condition of small velocities @xmath14 provided @xmath15 is limited .",
    "with help of the numerical program described in @xcite we were able to test the conjecture for different equations of state and different topologies in the case of the quadrupole and octupole moments .",
    "exemplarily we will show some of the results to underline the conjecture .",
    "the tests covered three equations of state for spheroidal stars containing homogeneous matter , an mit - bag model equation of state for quark matter following @xcite and a model for a completely degenerated ideal neutron gas following @xcite and additionally a quadrupole - test for thin rotating rings .",
    "figures [ fig : mit - bag , quadrupole ] and [ fig : rings : quadrupole ] show @xmath16 for the cases of a star with an mit - bag model equation of state and homogeneous rings , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 for quadrupole moments of strange stars with an mit - bag model equation of state and varying masses depending on the ratio of polar to equatorial radius . ]    rotating homogeneous rings for different ratios of radii depending on the redshift parameter @xmath17 , see @xcite . ]",
    "figure [ fig : octupole : homogeneous ] shows a test in the case of the octupole moment for homogeneous stars with different masses .",
    "@xmath18 for homogeneous stars with different masses . ]      the rigidly rotating disk of dust was solved analytically by neugebauer and meinel @xcite .",
    "the associated multipole moments were derived shortly thereafter by kleinwchter et al .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite . figure [ fig : disk ] shows that in this case the conjecture is true for @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , it is interesting that we have @xmath20 .     the rigidly rotating disk of dust :",
    "the conjecture has been verified up to @xmath21 .",
    "the solution depends on a parameter @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 corresponds to the newtonian limit and @xmath24 leads to the black hole limit , see @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "since it is easy to construct solutions of the vacuum einstein - equations violating the conjecture , e.g. with the algorithm presented by manko and ruiz in @xcite , it will be interesting to investigate , which requirements on the sources are necessary to ensure @xmath25 and which are not necessary ."
