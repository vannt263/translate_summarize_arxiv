    "the behavior of global spectral invariants of laplace - type operators under various deformations plays an important role in different areas of mathematics and physics . for example , the behavior of effective actions under conformal transformations has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "the main reason for these studies is that exact results for a given operator may sometimes be obtained by transforming to a simpler operator where the answer is known @xcite .",
    "this has applications in quantum field theories in curved space times @xcite and in finite temperature theories in static spacetimes @xcite . also the change of the effective action when deforming the boundary of a region",
    "can be studied this way @xcite .",
    "mathematically the analysis of effective actions amounts to the evaluation of functional determinants as they have been introduced by ray and singer @xcite to give a definition of the reidemeister - franz torsion @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned conformal transformation properties have been crucial in the proof of extremal properties of determinants @xcite .",
    "but also completely different transformation properties have been analyzed .",
    "in particular , the behavior of determinants of laplace - type operators with respect to certain singular deformations has been analyzed in great detail .",
    "one type of deformation is a literal _ cut and paste _ decomposition formula for the determinant when the underlying manifold is cut along a dividing hypersurface into two manifolds with boundary .",
    "this was initiated by burghelea , friedlander and kappeler @xcite with further developments in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on a different type of deformation , called _ analytic surgery _",
    "( although we do have something to say about `` cutting and pasting ''  see section [ sec - glueform ] ) .",
    "this method was introduced to study the behavior of the eta and functional determinant invariants of dirac- and laplace - type operators when a collar neighborhood of a dividing hypersurface of a closed manifold is stretched to a cylinder of infinite length , or when a collar neighborhood of the boundary of a manifold with boundary is stretched to an infinite cylinder .",
    "the limit manifolds under analytic surgery are noncompact complete manifolds and there are additional complications due to the presence of a continuous spectrum , which can be addressed using techniques such as melrose s @xmath0-calculus @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "analytic surgery was first discussed geometrically , in the context of the eta invariant , by singer @xcite , and the first papers to systematize the analysis of such degenerations for the eta invariant and functional determinant were provided by douglas and wojciechowski @xcite ( who named the process _ taking the adiabatic limit _ ) and by hassell , mazzeo and melrose @xcite , from which we get the terminology _ analytic surgery_. later related developments are given by various authors in @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite and @xcite are quite different .",
    "the former is based on heat kernel estimates with a systematic use of the duhamel principle for the heat kernel .",
    "the latter is based on encoding the degeneracy of the schwartz kernel of the resolvent uniformly as the cylinder is stretched in an appropriate blown - up manifold @xcite .",
    "it is this latter method on which the present paper is based , with the exception that a gluing - type formula is used to bypass the surgery calculus of hassell - mazzeo - melrose to directly analyze resolvents using the @xmath0-calculus @xcite .",
    "a seemingly different area where the change of spectral properties is relevant is the casimir effect ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "calculations of casimir energies are often plagued by divergencies and suitable subtractions need to be made .",
    "this need is based on the fact that only energy differences between two states have a physical meaning . by comparing suitable configurations",
    "infinities cancel and finite answers are obtained . in this context",
    "it would be most desirable to know how the casimir energy changes when one of these configurations is deformed into the other , where typical deformations would be a change in the geometry of an object or a boundary condition .",
    "the change between configurations in suitable classes would be finite by construction and no ambiguities would arise @xcite .",
    "several approaches to analyze the casimir energy are available .",
    "technically closest related to the topic of functional determinants is the zeta function method . assuming a discrete spectrum @xmath1 of the laplace - type operator @xmath2 , the zeta function",
    "is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 of the complex parameter @xmath5 needs to be sufficiently large such as to make this sum convergent @xcite .",
    "the determinant is then defined by @xmath6 , whereas the casimir energy is related to ( the finite part of ) @xmath7 .",
    "if in addition to the above mentioned transformation properties for determinants analogous properties were to exist for the casimir energies , it would seem natural to assume that suitable relations should not just hold at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but in fact for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is exactly what the present article is about .",
    "although our initial goal was to find relations between casimir energies for different configurations , the just mentioned observation led us to analytic surgery formulas for zeta functions valid for all values of the complex parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the results obtained are described and summarized in the following .",
    "let @xmath2 be a laplace - type operator on @xmath10 , a compact riemannian manifold with boundary , and let @xmath11 . throughout this paper , `",
    "laplace - type ' means a symmetric ( formally self - adjoint ) , nonnegative , second order differential operator acting between sections of a hermitian vector bundle whose principal symbol is the underlying riemannian metric . for notational simplicity we will always leave out vector bundles from our notations and pretend our operators are acting on functions .",

    "let @xmath352 be a sectorial region , which recall means that outside some neighborhood of the origin , @xmath353 equals a sector ( solid angle ) .",
    "we define the space @xmath546 as the space of @xmath354-valued schwartz functions on @xmath547 that are exponentially decreasing in @xmath98 ; more precisely , @xmath548 means that for some @xmath181 , we have @xmath549 where the space on the right consists of @xmath354-valued schwartz functions on @xmath547 .",
    "equivalently , we can put @xmath353 as another parameter space and write @xmath550 here is a useful lemma concerning this space of operators .",
    "[ lem - ideal ] the space @xmath546 is an ideal in the space of parameter dependent operators in the sense that if @xmath548 and @xmath356 is parameter dependent in @xmath357 of any given weight , then @xmath551 .",
    "since the spaces of parameter dependent operators are closed under taking adjoints , we just have to check the result for @xmath552 ( since the result for @xmath553 would follow from the result for @xmath554 by taking adjoints ) . by definition of parameter dependent operators ( see the discussion around ) , if the schwartz kernel of @xmath356 vanishes near the diagonal in @xmath164 , then @xmath356 is an element of @xmath354 and in this case it is easy to prove that @xmath555 .",
    "thus , we may assume that the schwartz kernel of @xmath356 ( and @xmath556 ) is supported on some coordinate patch @xmath557 where @xmath558 is a coordinate patch on @xmath15 , in which case we can write @xmath360 where @xmath559 satisfies the symbol estimates . therefore with @xmath560 , we have @xmath561 where @xmath562 since @xmath563 is smooth in all variables and rapidly decreasing as @xmath544 , @xmath564 has the same properties and , by well - known results on the fourier transform ,",
    "is rapidly decreasing as @xmath565 .",
    "it follows that @xmath566 has the same properties as @xmath563 .",
    "this completes our proof .",

    "let @xmath577 and write @xmath578 where @xmath579 and where the @xmath318 depends on the sign of @xmath184 .",
    "thus , @xmath580 , so @xmath581 by the half - angle formula , @xmath582 an elementary exercise shows that for @xmath577 , @xmath583 and @xmath584 and @xmath585 .",
    "thus , @xmath586 this proves our claim .    using ( [ starstar ] )",
    ", one can verify that for all @xmath569 , @xmath570 and @xmath571 we have @xmath587 note that there is a constant @xmath588 with @xmath589 such that for all @xmath590 and @xmath591 we have @xmath592 ( just take @xmath593 ) . putting @xmath594 and @xmath595 shows that @xmath596 this completes our proof .",
    "let @xmath598 be the eigenvalues of @xmath14 , with @xmath599 the smallest one , and let @xmath600 be the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors .",
    "then it follows directly from the properties of the topology on @xmath349 that a parameter dependent operator @xmath556 on @xmath601 defines an element @xmath602 if and only if for each @xmath603 , the function @xmath604 is smooth in @xmath605 and rapidly decreasing , with all derivatives in @xmath606 , as @xmath607 .",
    "indeed , one can prove this from the fourier series representation of the schwartz kernel of @xmath556 : @xmath608 in our situation the schwartz kernel @xmath545 is of the form @xmath609 so we just have to prove that @xmath610 is rapidly decreasing , with all derivatives in @xmath611 , as @xmath612 .",
    "observe that any such derivative is a linear combination of terms of the form @xmath613 where @xmath614 and @xmath615 .",
    "now according to lemma [ lem - estimate ] there is a constant @xmath399 such that for all @xmath357 , @xmath571 , and all @xmath616 , @xmath617 and @xmath618 hence , for all @xmath357 , @xmath571 , and all @xmath616 , @xmath619 which is rapidly decreasing as @xmath612 .",
    "thus , @xmath620 . moreover , because of the @xmath621 term in the previous inequality it follows that @xmath622 where @xmath623 .",
    "this completes our proof .      assuming that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we need to prove that there is an @xmath35 such that @xmath624 belongs to @xmath524 and is an entire function of @xmath36 that vanishes exponentially fast as @xmath38 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath39 .",

    "we know that @xmath528 where @xmath545 is the operator given in proposition [ prop - rrinfty ] .",
    "hence , @xmath627 where @xmath628 , provided that @xmath478 is invertible . now comes the assumption @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath629 is invertible it follows that ( see the discussion around ) @xmath630 exists and even more , @xmath631 exists for all @xmath632 for some @xmath461 . let @xmath633 where @xmath634 is the minimum of @xmath635 or @xmath636 with @xmath599 is the smallest positive eigenvalue of @xmath14 . then @xmath631 is analytic for all @xmath357 .",
    "moreover , we already know that @xmath631 is parameter dependent of weight @xmath369 ( cf .  proposition [ prop - r ] ) , so by proposition [ propcr ] , @xmath597",
    ". hence , by lemma [ lem - ideal ] , we have @xmath637 . thus there is an @xmath35 such that for all @xmath46 , the operator norm of @xmath638 on @xmath639 is less then @xmath640 for all @xmath46 and @xmath357 .",
    "thus , from it follows that @xmath626 exists for all @xmath46 and @xmath357 , and @xmath641 now @xmath642 so @xmath643 from this we see that for all @xmath46 , @xmath644 where we can put @xmath645 , a contour which is independent of @xmath46 . finally , recalling that @xmath646 and the definition of the space @xmath647 it follows immediately that @xmath488 is , for @xmath46 , an entire function of @xmath36 that vanishes exponentially fast as @xmath38 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath39 .",
    "the assumption @xmath33 is important for the following reason .",
    "if @xmath648 then @xmath631 would have a pole at @xmath649 .",
    "thus , @xmath628 may have , for any @xmath80 no matter how large , an arbitrary large norm for small @xmath650 . hence for any @xmath80 , @xmath626 may fail to exist for some @xmath650 sufficiently small .",
    "now recall that @xmath398 is such that @xmath626 must be defined for @xmath439 $ ] .",
    "thus , if @xmath648 , then it is possible that @xmath651 would depend on @xmath98 .",
    "this would make the analysis of highly nontrivial .",
    "we first claim that for @xmath59 \\times y$ ] , we have @xmath655 to prove this we first note that given @xmath656 , @xmath657 solves @xmath533 and @xmath658 and @xmath659 .",
