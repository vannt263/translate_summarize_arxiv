    "after many years of pure academic research , the casimir effect @xcite is presently of much interest in connection with applications in nanomechanical devices @xcite , noncontact friction @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite and for constraining predictions of modern unification theories of fundamental interactions @xcite .",
    "these areas of application were made possible by extensive experimental investigation of the casimir force @xcite and the generalization to real materials of field - theoretical methods which were applicable to only idealized boundaries ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the basic theory of the casimir and van der waals forces at nonzero temperature proposed by lifshitz @xcite allows one to calculate all quantities of physical interest using the dielectric permittivity of boundary materials along the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "this theory was originally developed for the configuration of two semispaces and was later extended for any layer structure @xcite . using the proximity force theorem @xcite , lifshitz - type formulas for the configuration of a sphere or a cylinder above a plate were obtained and successfully used for the interpretation of experimental data @xcite . for a long time , the lack of exact results for these configurations made it possible to question the validity of the comparison of experiment and theory based on the proximity force theorem .",
    "recently , however , both the exact analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite results for the casimir force between a sphere ( cylinder ) and a plate were obtained demonstrating that at small @xmath0 the corrections to the proximity force theorem for both configurations are in fact less than @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is the separation between a cylinder or a sphere of radius @xmath2 and a plate ) , i.e. , less than it was supposed in the comparison of experiment with theory .",
    "thus , the use of the proximity force theorem in refs .",
    "@xcite and below is substantiated on the basis of first principles of quantum field theory .",
    "the vital issue in many applications of the casimir effect is how to control the magnitude of the force by changing the parameters of the system . in this respect",
    "the possibility that the casimir force can change sign from attraction to repulsion depending on system geometry is of much importance .",
    "it may be used to prevent collapse of small mechanical elements onto nearby surfaces in nanodevices @xcite .",
    "however , the casimir repulsion has yet to be observed experimentally .",
    "an alternative method to control the magnitude of the casimir force is to change the material properties of the interacting bodies . in ref .",
    "@xcite the casimir force was measured acting between a plate and a sphere coated with a hydrogen - switchable mirror that become transparent upon hydrogenation . despite expectations ,",
    "no significant decrease of the casimir force owing to the increased transparancy of the plates was observed .",
    "the negative result is explained by the lifshitz theory which requires the change of the reflectivity properties within a wide range of frequencies in order to markedly affect the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "this requirement is not satisfied by the hydrogenation .",
    "all modern experiments on the measurement of the casimir force mentioned above @xcite used metallic test bodies .",
    "metallic surfaces are necessary to reduce and compensate the effects of residual charges and work function differences .",
    "it is , however , hard to modify their reflectivity properties over a sufficiently wide range of frequencies .",
    "the appropriate materials for the control , modification and fine tunning of the casimir force are semiconductors .",
    "the reflectivity properties of semiconductor surfaces can be changed in a wide frequency range by changing the carrier density through the variation of temperature , using different kinds of doping or , alternatively , via the illumination of the surface with laser light . at the same time ,",
    "semiconductor surfaces with reasonably high conductivity avoid accumulation of excess charges and , thus , preserve the advantage of metals .",
    "in addition as semiconductors are the basic fabrication materials for nanotechnology , the use of semiconductor surfaces for the control of the casimir force will lead to many applications .",
    "the modification of the casimir force between a gold coated plate and sphere , attached to the cantilever of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) , through the variation of temperature was considered in ref .",
    "while changing the temperature to modify the carrier density in semiconductors is a good method in theory , it leads @xcite to large systematic errors in the measurement setup using the afm . in ref .",
    "@xcite the casimir force between a gold coated sphere and a single crystal b - doped si plate was measured in high vacuum .",
    "it was found that the force between a metal and a semiconductor decreases with increase of separation more quickly than between two metals . in ref .",
    "@xcite the experimental data for the casimir force between a gold coated sphere and b - doped si plate were compared with two different theoretical computations , one made for the b - doped si used and another one for high - resistivity si .",
    "it was shown that the computation using the tabulated optical data for high - resistivity si is excluded by experiment at 70% confidence while the theoretical results computed for the plate used in experiment are consistent with data . in ref .",
    "@xcite the difference in the casimir forces between a gold coated sphere and two p - doped si plates with different charge - carrier densities was directly measured at a 95% confidence level .",
    "this demonstrates that the change of carrier density due to doping leads to noticeable modification of the casimir force .",
    "the most suitable method to change the carrier density in semiconductors is through the illumination of the surfaces by laser light ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an early attempt to measure the van der waals and the casimir forces between semiconductors and modify them with light was reported in ref .",
    "attractive forces were measured between a glass lens and a si plate and also between the glass lens coated with amorphous si and the si plate . however",
    ", the glass lens is an insulator and therefore the electric forces such as due to work function potential differences could not be controlled .",
    "this might also explain that no force change occured on illumination at separations below 350 nm @xcite where it should have been most pronounced .",
    "the present paper contains the detailed results of our experiments on the modification of the casimir force by the irradiation of a si membrane with laser pulses .",
    "the first observation of this effect at only one absorbed power was briefly reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we report new measurements performed at different absorbed powers and the theoretical analysis on the accuracy of the obtained results and on the comparison of experiment with theory . in our experiments",
    "the carrier density in the si membrane is changed by the incident light , and the difference in the casimir force acting between that membrane and the gold coated sphere in the presence and in the absence of light is measured .",
    "the experimental error of difference force measurements for the different absorbed powers determined at a 95% confidence level varies between 10 to 20% at a separation of 100 nm and increases with the increase of separation .",
    "the measurement data collected at different powers of the incident light at the laboratory temperature @xmath3k were compared with the lifshitz theory at both zero and at laboratory temperatures .",
    "the data are shown to be consistent with theory at laboratory temperature if in the absence of light the static dielectric permittivity of si is assumed to be finite .",
    "the lifshitz theory at laboratory temperature taking account of the dc conductivity of high - resistivity si in the absence of light is excluded experimentally at a 95% confidence level .",
    "thus , our experiments not only demonstrate the modification of the casimir force through the irradiation of a semiconductor surface , but also lead to the important result that the inclusion of zero - frequency conductivity of high - resistivity si in the model of dielectric response results in a contradiction between the lifshitz theory at laboratory temperature and experiment .",
    "this contradiction is caused by different contributions from the reflection of the transverse magnetic mode on a si surface at zero frequency in the absence and in the presence of conductivity .",
    "the obtained conclusion supports recent theoretical results that the inclusion of dielectric dc conductivity for the dielectric - dielectric @xcite and dielectric - metal @xcite configurations at nonzero temperature leads to contradiction between the lifshitz theory and the nernst heat theorem , and thus such inclusion is impermissible . at the same time , the experimental data are shown to be consistent with the lifshitz theory at zero temperature , irrespective of whether the dc conductivity of high - resistivity si is included or not .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the experimental setup and sample preparation are described .",
    "iii contains the description of the measurement procedure and obtained experimental results .",
    "this includes the calibration of the setup , the measurement of the lifetime of excited carriers , the measurement of the difference in the casimir force when the light is on and off , and the analysis of the experimental errors . in sec .",
    "iv the experimental results are compared with the theory . here",
    "the difference in the casimir force with and without incident laser light is calculated and the theoretical errors are analyzed . by combining the experimental and theoretical errors , the quantitative measure of agreement between experiment and theory at 95% confidence is presented .",
    "v analyzes the role of the dc conductivity of high - resistivity si in the casimir force .",
    "vi contains our conclusions and discussion .",
    "here we discuss the experimental setup used to demonstrate the modification of the casimir force through the radiation induced change in the carrier density .",
    "the general scheme of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "a high vacuum based afm was employed to measure the change in the casimir force between a gold coated sphere of diameter @xmath4 m and a si membrane ( coloured black ) in the presence and in the absence of incident light .",
    "an oil free vacuum chamber with a pressure of around @xmath5torr was used . the polystyrene sphere coated with a gold layer of @xmath6 nm thickness",
    "was mounted at the tip of a 320@xmath7 m conductive cantilever ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "the si membrane ( see below for the process of its preparation ) was mounted on top of a piezo which is used to change the separation distance @xmath0 between the sphere and the membrane from contact to 6@xmath7 m .",
    "the excitation of the carriers in the si membrane was done with 5ms wide light pulses ( 50% duty cycle ) .",
    "these pulses were obtained from a cw ar ion laser light at 514 nm wavelength modulated at a frequency of 100hz using an acousto - optic - modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the aom is triggered with a function generator .",
    "the laser pulses were focused on the bottom surface of the si membrane .",
    "the gaussian width of the focused beam on the membrane was measured to be @xmath8 mm .",
    "the cantilever of the afm flexes when the casimir force between the sphere and the membrane changes depending on the presence or the absence of incident light on the membrane .",
    "this cantilever deflection is monitored with a 640 nm beam from an additional laser ( see fig",
    ".  [ setup ] ) reflected off the top of the cantilever tip .",
    "an optical filter was used to prevent the interference of the 514 nm excitation light with the cantilever deflection signal .",
    "the transmission of this filter at 514 nm is 0.001% . including the less than 1% transmission through the si membrane and the diode solid angle of @xmath9 , the impact of the 514 nm light leakage leads to less than @xmath10pn changes in the force difference .",
    "these changes are negligibly small as compared with the measured cantilever deflection signal .",
    "the latter leads to a difference signal between the two photodiodes .",
    "the resulting modification of the casimir force in response to the carrier excitation is measured with a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the same function generator signal used to generate the ar laser pulses is also used as a reference for the lock - in amplifier .",
    "the most important part of the setup is the si membrane",
    ". it should be sufficiently thin and of high resistivity to ensure that the density of charge carriers increases by several orders of magnitude under the influence of the laser pulses .",
    "the si membrane should be thick enough to make negligible the photon pressure of the transmitted light , as the illumination is incident on the bottom surface of the membrane ( see sec .",
    "ivb for details ) .",
    "the thickness of the si membrane has to be greater than 1@xmath11 m , i.e. , greater than the optical absorption depth of si at the wavelength of the laser pulses",
    ". fabrication of the few micrometer thick si membrane with the necessary properties is described below .",
    "a commercial si grown on insulator wafer ( soi ) was used as the initial product .",
    "the insulator in this case is sio@xmath12 which is the native oxide of si and thus leads to only small reductions of the excited carrier lifetime in si . a layout of the wafer is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the wafer consists of a si substrate of 600@xmath7 m thickness and a si top layer of 5@xmath7 m thickness ( both are single crystals and have a @xmath13 crystal orientation ) with the buried intermediate sio@xmath12 layer of thickness 400 nm ( see fig",
    "the si is p - type doped with relatively high nominal resistivity of about 10@xmath14 cm .",
    "the corresponding carrier density is equal to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the si substrate is reduced to about 200@xmath7 m through mechanical polishing . then , after rca cleaning of the surface , the wafer is oxidized at @xmath16k in a dry o@xmath12 atmosphere for a duration of 72 hours . as a result , in addition to the buried sio@xmath12 layer , a thermal oxide layer with a thickness of about 1@xmath7 m is formed on both ( bottom and top ) sides of the wafer ( fig .",
    "this oxide layer serves as a mask for subsequent tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide ( tmah ) etching of the si .",
    "first , a hole with the diameter of 0.85 mm is etched with hf in the center of the bottom oxidation layer ( fig .",
    "this exposes the si substrate .",
    "next , tmah is used at 363k to etch the si substrate through the hole formed in the oxide mask ( fig .",
    "note that tmah selectively etches si as its etching rate for si is 1000 times greater than for sio@xmath12 .",
    "tmah etching leads to the formation of a hole through the si substrate .",
    "given the selectivity of the etching , the buried 400 nm oxide is the stop etch layer .",
    "finally , all the thermal oxidation layers and buried oxidation layer in the hole are etched away in hf solution to form a clean si membrane over the hole as in fig .",
    "the thickness of this membrane was measured to be @xmath17 m using an optical microscope . in order for voltages to be applied to the si membrane , an ohmic contact is formed by a thin film of au deposited on the edge of the membrane followed by annealing at 673k for 10 min .",
    "the si membrane was cleaned with nanostrip and then passivated by dipping in 49% hf for 10s .",
    "the passivated si membrane was then mounted on top of the piezo as described above .",
    "all calibrations and other measurements are done at the same period of time as the measurement of the difference of casimir forces and in the same high vacuum apparatus .",
    "the calibration of the deflection signal of the cantilever from the photodiodes , @xmath18 , and the determination of the separation on contact and residual potential difference between the gold coated sphere and si membrane is done by measuring the distance dependence of an applied electrostatic force . for this purpose the same function generator ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) is used for applying voltages to the membrane . for an attractive force @xmath19 and can be measured either as a current or a voltage .",
    "in addition , a small correction has to be applied to the separation distance between the gold sphere and the si membrane due to the movement of the cantilever .",
    "the actual separation distance @xmath0 between the bottom of the sphere and the membrane is given by @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the distance moved by the piezo , @xmath22 is the deflection coefficient in units of nm per unit deflection signal , and @xmath23 is the average separation on contact of the gold surface and si membrane .",
    "@xmath23 is nonzero due to the stochastic roughness of the surfaces .",
    "the complete movement of the piezo was calibrated using a fiber optic interferometer . to extend and contract the piezo , continuous triangular voltages between 0.010.02hz",
    "are applied to it .",
    "given that the experiment is done at room temperature , applying of static voltages would lead to piezo creep and loss of position sensitivity .",
    "the deflection coefficient @xmath22 can also be measured by the application of electrostatic forces between the sphere and the membrane .    in our measurements ,",
    "the gold sphere was kept grounded .",
    "the electric contact to the sphere was accomplished by applying a very thin gold coating to the cantilever .",
    "the electrostatic force between the sphere and the membrane is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the voltage applied to the si membrane , @xmath26 is the residual potential difference between the grounded sphere and membrane , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the permittivity of vacuum . the nonzero value of @xmath0 at contact , @xmath23 , is due to the surface roughness . in the complete measurement range of the electrostatic force from contact to 6@xmath11 m , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can be rearranged to the following more simple form within the limits of relative error less than @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30    first , 30 different dc voltages between 0.65 to 0.91v are applied to the si membrane .",
    "the cantilever deflection signal is measured as a function of the distance .",
    "the 0.02hz triangular wave was applied to the piezo to change the distance between the sphere and the membrane over a range of 6@xmath11 m .",
    "larger applied voltages lead to more cantilever deflection and , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , to a contact of the two surfaces at larger @xmath21 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath21 at contact of the sphere and the membrane on the applied voltage can then be used to measure the deflection coefficient @xmath22 . in order to determine the contact of the two surfaces",
    "precisely , 32768 data points at equal time intervals were acquired for each force measurement ( i.e. , the interval between two points was about 0.18 nm ) . in cases , where the contact point was between two neighboring data points ,",
    "a linear interpolation was used to identify the exact value .",
    "the deflection coefficient was found to be @xmath31 nm per unit deflection signal .",
    "the difference in the value of @xmath22 from previous measurements @xcite is due to the use of the 514 nm filter which reduced the cantilever deflection signal .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath22 was used to correct the separation distance in all measurements in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",

    "an improved method , rather than simple application of the dc voltages to the membrane was used .",
    "this was done to avoid systematic errors due to scattered laser light .",
    "in addition to the application of the dc voltage to the membrane , described above , square voltage pulse of amplitudes from 1.2 to 0.6v and time interval corresponding to a separation distance between 1 to 5@xmath11 m was also applied to the membrane . fig .",
    "[ deflsignal ] shows the deflection signal of the cantilever in response to both the applied dc voltage and the square pulse as a function of the separation distance between the gold sphere and si membrane . by measuring only the difference in signal during the pulse",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) leads to the value of the signal calibration constant @xmath35nn per unit deflection signal .",
    "the same fit was used to determine the residual potential difference between the sphere and the membrane which was found to be @xmath36v .",
    "the large width of the pulse applied in addition to the dc voltage allowed confirmation of the distance independence of the obtained values of the calibration constant and the residual potential difference .",
    "an independent measurement of the lifetime of the carriers excited in the si membrane by the pulses from the ar laser was performed .",
    "for this purpose a non - invasive optical pump - probe technique was used @xcite .",
    "the same si membrane and ar laser beam modulated by the aom at 100hz to produce 5ms wide square light pulses , as used in the casimir force measurement , were employed as the sample and the pump , respectively .",
    "the diameter of the pump beam on the sample was measured to be @xmath37 mm .",
    "a cw beam with a 1mw power at a wavelength of 1300 nm was used as a probe .",
    "the probe beam photon energy is below the band gap energy of si and is thus not involved in carrier generation .",
    "this beam was focused to a gaussian width size @xmath38 mm .",
    "thus the focal spot size of the probe beam is much smaller than the focal spot size of the pump light .",
    "this allowed one to measure the lifetime in a homogeneous region of excited carriers .",
    "the change in the reflected intensity of the probe beam in the presence and in the absence of ar laser pulse was detected with a ingaas photodiode .",
    "the change in reflected power of the probe beam was monitored as a function of time in an oscilloscope and found to be consistent with the change of carrier density .",
    "near normal incidence for the pump and probe beams was used , with care taken to make sure that the ingaas photodiode was isolated from the pump beam .",
    "the time decay of the reflected probe beam in response to the square ar light pulses is shown in fig .",
    "[ lifetime ] .",
    "the change of the reflectivity of the probe is fit to an exponential of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective carrier lifetime . by fitting the whole 5ms decay of the change in reflected power ,",

    "note that this time represents both surface and bulk recombination and is consistent with that expected for si .",
    "some dependence of the lifetime of the excited carriers on their concentration was observed . in the first 0.5ms , while the concentration is still high enough , the average value of the excited carrier lifetime was measured to be @xmath42ms .",
    "the measured values of the carrier lifetime will be used in sec .",
    "iva in the theoretical computations of the casimir force differences for the comparison with several measurements having varying power of ar laser .      here",
    "we present the determination of the difference in the casimir force resulting from the irradiation of the si membrane with 514 nm laser pulses .",
    "in fact it is the difference in the total force ( casimir and electric ) which is measured .",
    "as was indicated above , even with no applied voltages there is some residual potential difference @xmath26 between the sphere and the membrane .",

    "the small change of around 78mv in the residual potential difference between the sphere and the membrane in the presence and in the absence of excitation light is primarily due to the screening of surface states by few of the optically excited electrons and holes .",

    "although we are still lacking a fundamental explanation of why the lifshitz theory does not admit inclusion of the conductivity properties of high - resistivity materials at zero frequency , this prescription on how to perform computations in an experimentally and thermodynamically consistent way is topical for numerous applications of the van der waals and casimir forces ranging from condensed matter physics and nanotechnology to the theory of fundamental interactions .",
    "the experimentally demonstrated phenomenon of modulation of the casimir force through optical modification of charge - carrier density will be used in the design and function of micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices such as nanoscale actuators , micromirrors and nanotweezers .",
