    "background estimation is one of the crucial steps in video analysis systems .",
    "the celebrated eigen - background model proposed in @xcite was the first case when principal component analysis  ( pca ) was used in background modeling .",
    "recently , using a sparse model for the foreground and a low rank model for the background , @xcite proposed a robust principal component analysis  ( rpca ) model .    for an integer @xmath1 and a matrix @xmath2",
    ", the classical pca can be cast as : @xmath3   + where @xmath4 denotes the rank of the matrix @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the frobenius norm of matrices . the solutions to  ( [ pca ] )",
    "are given using the singular value decompositions  ( svds ) of @xmath7 through the hard thresholding operations on the singular values : @xmath8   + where @xmath9 is a svd of @xmath7 and @xmath10 is the diagonal matrix obtained from @xmath11 by hard - thresholding :  keeping only the largest @xmath12 entries and replacing the others by 0 .  in literature",
    "this is also referred to as eckart - young - mirsky s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the solutions to  ( [ pca ] ) as given in  ( [ hardthresholding ] ) suffer from the fact that none of the entries of @xmath7 is guaranteed to be preserved in @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this could be a limitation of pca , as in many real world problems one has good reasons to keep certain entries of @xmath14 unchanged while looking for a low rank approximation .",
    "for example , if we know that certain frames of the input video matrix @xmath7 , say frames # 1 and # 5 , are pure background , then we may insist on preserving columns # 1 and # 5 when looking for a low rank approximation .  in 1987 ,",
    "golub , hoffman , and stewart proposed the following _ constrained _ low rank approximation problem  @xcite : given @xmath15 find @xmath16 such that   + @xmath17 that is , golub , hoffman , and stewart required that the first few columns , @xmath18 of @xmath7 must be preserved when one looks for a low rank approximation of @xmath19 as in the standard low rank approximation , the constrained low - rank approximation problem of golub , hoffman , and stewart also has a closed form solution .",
    "+    @xcite [ theorem 1 ] if @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 then the solutions to  ( [ golub s problem ] ) are given by @xmath23   + where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the projection operators to the column space of @xmath26 and its orthogonal complement , respectively .    instead of requiring exact matching in the first few columns ,  as in  problem  ( [ golub s problem ] )",
    ", we may only be interested in the case when the first few columns are close to the given ones .",
    "for example , for background estimation , we may have prior knowledge that some frames ( say , represented by the columns of @xmath26 ) are _ almost _ pure background .",
    "so , @xmath27",
    "+ for some true background frames @xmath28 and _ small _ noise @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we need to recover @xmath28 instead of matching @xmath26 exactly .",
    "so , we consider the following problem : given @xmath30 and @xmath31 , solve : @xmath32   + where @xmath33 denotes the entrywise multiplication .  problem  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) is a special case of weighted low rank approximation  @xcite :  consider the following problem with @xmath34 of non - negative terms @xmath35   + unlike classical ( unweighted ) low rank approximation , problem  ( [ hadamard problem ] ) has no closed form solution in general  @xcite .",
    "so , numerical methods must be employed .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated in  @xcite that a method based on solving  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) can outperform the rpca methods .  in this paper",
    "we propose a faster algorithm by exploiting an interesting property of the solution to problem  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) .",
    "our algorithm is capable of achieving the desired accuracy faster as compared to  @xcite and outperforming rpca methods  @xcite in background estimation problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .  in section  [ property ]",
    ",  we make an important observation on the solution to  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) .  based on this observation",
    ", we propose a new algorithm to solve problem  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) in section  [ algorithm ] .",
    "numerical results demonstrating the performance of the proposed algorithm are given in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "we will design our algorithm using the observation as stated in the following result .",

    "in this section we propose a numerical algorithm to solve  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) .",
    "we do not use the general algorithm as in  @xcite for solving  ( [ hadamard problem ] ) , since we focus on the special weight where @xmath47 , a matrix of all 1s .  in  @xcite ,  the authors proposed an algorithm wlr to solve  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) which takes advantage of the special weight and performs much faster than the general weighted algorithm .",
    "a rigorous comparison of accuracy and efficiency of wlr compare to the general weighted low rank approximation algorithms is discussed in  @xcite .  in this section ,",

    "this special choice of the weight is justified as follows :  in background subtraction , we only need to put large weights on the columns ( frames ) that are more likely to be the background and leave the rest of the columns unweighted  ( and thus with weight @xmath49 ) .",
    "our new algorithm is not based on matrix factorization to address the rank constraint  @xcite .",
    "instead , we exploit the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath51 in the optimal solution .",
    "we will use  theorem  [ theorem 7 ] to device an iterative process to solve  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath52 then any @xmath50 such that @xmath53 can be given in the form @xmath54   + for some arbitrary matrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 .",
    "therefore ,  ( [ 2nd approximate golub s problem ] ) becomes an constrained weighted low - rank approximation problem : @xmath58   + denote @xmath59 as the objective function .",
    "assume that at the @xmath60-th step we have @xmath61 .",
    "we need to find @xmath62 by solving @xmath63 then theorem  [ theorem 7 ] suggests   + @xmath64 so , if @xmath61 has its qr decomposition :   + @xmath65 then @xmath66 and   + @xmath67 with @xmath68 being a svd of @xmath69 .",

    "let @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 is a solution to  ( [ main problem 2 ] ) .",
    "we denote @xmath86 as our approximation to @xmath87 at @xmath60th iteration .",

    "the algorithm performs the best when we initialize @xmath51 as a random matrix and takes 510 iterations to converge .",

    "( rpca ) method for background estimation problems uses the fact that the background frames , @xmath14 , have a low - rank structure and the foreground @xmath95 is sparse  @xcite and solves : @xmath96 for rpca , we use the inexact augmented lagrange multiplier  ( iealm ) method proposed by lin et .",

    "we perform our experiments on  the stuttgart synthetic video data set  @xcite .",
    "it is a computer generated video sequence , that comprises gradual or sudden change of illumination , a dynamic background containing non - stationary objects and a static foreground , camouflage , and sensor noise or compression artifacts .",
    "we perform qualitative and quantitative analysis on two different test scenarios of the sequence : ( i ) _ basic _ and  ( ii ) _ noisy night_. each scenario has 600 frames with identical foreground and background objects .",
    "frame numbers 551 to 600 have static foreground , and frame numbers 6 to 12 and 483 to 528 have no foreground .  additionally , the foreground comes with high quality ground truth mask for each video frame .      in figure  [ weight_435 ]",
    ", we demonstrate the effects of using big weights on the frames in the first block @xmath100 for swlr . with proper choice of @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath101 the large weights in @xmath102 produces a better background estimation .  in figure",
    "[ basic ] , we present qualitative comparison between the background estimated by swlr and rpca algorithms . since apg and iealm both have same reconstruction we only present apg here .  in both scenarios , swlr provides a substantially better background estimation than apg .    for quantitative comparison between different methods we use  the most advanced measure structural similarity index  ( ssim ) in figure  [ ssim](a ) and  ( b ) .  according to  @xcite",
    ",  the ssim index can be viewed as a robust quality measure of a recovered image , compare to the other image that is regarded as of perfect quality .",
    "it compares the luminance change , contrast change , and structural change in the recovered image and agree with human visual perception the most compare to any other standard measures .",
    "our background estimation experiments for swlr are based on a prior knowledge of the background frame indexes .  from the ground truth ,",
    "we know that the entire sequence has 60 foreground frames that has less than 10 pixels .  given 60 pure background frames we choose @xmath103 by random sampling , where @xmath104 .",

    "_ noisy night _ @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively , are the best choice .",
    "since the qualitative and quantitative results for background estimation are same for both wlr and swlr we only provide their runtime comparison  ( see figure  [ ssim ]  ( c ) ) .  in figure  [ ssim](c ) , the increment in time for the rpca algorithms",
    "as we increase the dimension of the test matrix by adding more frames can be attributed by computation of a larger rank svd in each step of their iteration . on the other hand",
    ", swlr performs a fixed rank svd once the background frames are learned .",
    "in this paper we presented a simple and fast numerical algorithm to solve a weighted low rank approximation problem for a special family of weights .  to demonstrate its use in the real world problems we performed background estimation from video sequences when a prior knowledge of approximated background fames is available .",
    "we did not address the question on how to automatically learn the weight from the data which is treated in  @xcite .",
    "the performance of our weighted low - rank approximation algorithm over the existing rpca algorithms shows the fact that a weighted frobenius norm can be made robust to sparse outliers .  with additional knowledge of some approximate frames learned from the data , our algorithm can outperform the rpca algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency"
