    "[ sec : intr ] while luminous models for the central parts of galaxies do not usually require a dark matter ( dm ) component , massive halos of dm must be taken into account if one wants to construct realistic potential - density pairs for an entire galaxy , in order to reproduce the observed nearly - flat galactic rotation curves .",
    "curiously , there is a considerable body of evidence that the galactic mass profiles of baryonic and dark matter are not uncorrelated ( mcgaugh 2005 ) .",
    "the correlation between the newtonian gravity of the baryons @xmath1 and the overall gravity @xmath2 ( baryons plus dm ) can be loosely parameterized by milgrom s ( 1983 ) empirical relation @xmath3 where the interpolating function @xmath4 is a function which runs smoothly from @xmath5 at @xmath6 to @xmath7 at @xmath8 with a dividing gravity scale @xmath9 at the transition .",
    "it is a very serious challenge for cold dark matter simulations to reproduce this empirical relation . on the other hand ,",
    "this relation can be interpreted as a modification of the newton - einstein gravitational law in the ultra - weak field regime , with no actual need for dark matter ( at the galaxy scale ) .",
    "this provocative idea was taken as the basis for the mond theory : however , using eq.(1 ) alone to transform @xmath10 into @xmath2 does not provide a respectable gravitational force preserving energy and angular momentum .",
    "bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) then suggested modifying the poisson equation in order to produce a non - relativistic mond potential .",
    "this proposal was recently refined by bekenstein ( 2004 ) who presented a lorentz - covariant theory of gravity , dubbed teves , yielding mondian behaviour in the appropriate limit .",
    "however , there is a subtle difference between the non - relativistic formulation of mond and the relativistic teves , namely the number of fields involved : in mond , the potential is modified directly in order to trigger the mond phenomenology , while in teves , a scalar field is added to the traditional newtonian potential .",
    "these two descriptions are equivalent only in highly symmetric systems ( spherical or cylindrical symmetry ) . for disk galaxies , eq.([eqn : mueq ] ) is a good approximation of the mond and teves gravitational theories since the additional curl field ( see  [ sec : montev ] ) is small when solving the modified poisson equation for the potential or the scalar field ( brada & milgrom 1995 ) .",
    "for this reason , eq.([eqn : mueq ] ) has been used with confidence to fit the rotation curves of an impressive list of external galaxies with remarkable accuracy ( sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) . however , very little work has been carried out to study the actual effect of the curl field in the non - relativistic mond theory ( brada & milgrom 1995 , 1999 ; ciotti , londrillo & nipoti 2006 ) , while the quantitative difference between the predictions of mond and teves has not been studied at all . the issue has become urgent as recent evidence against mond is largely based on multi - centred systems such as satellites of the milky way ( zhao 2005 ) and the bullet cluster of merging galaxies ( clowe et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "after recalling some basic formulae of mond and teves (  [ sec : montev ] ) , we propose a set of parametric interpolating functions that are physical in teves (  [ sec : inter ] ) .",
    "then we present spherical analytical potential - density pairs for the baryon distribution in early type galaxies , galactic bulges and dwarf spheroidals , valid in mond as well as in teves (  [ sec : spherpot ] ) . for this model",
    "we work out the density , potential , circular velocity , isotropic and anisotropic distribution functions .",
    "we also show a simple analytical expression for the gravitational bending angle",
    ". then we present the combination of such models in multi - centred systems for the classical mond approximation([sec : twocenter ] ) ; this provides an indication of the kind of result we could expect from a rigorous modelling of the bullet cluster of galaxies ( clowe et al .",
    "more generally , we then show how to extend those spherical models to oblate ones (  [ sec : flatmond ] ) . in those non - spherical situations , the density corresponding to a given potential differs in the classical mond and in teves . to illustrate this , we study the effects of the flattening of the potential in the special case of scale - free oblate one - dimensional models (  [ sec : scalefree ] ) , and we explicitly show the subtle differences between the different theoretical frameworks .",
    "note that milgrom ( 1994 ) has also suggested that mond could have a modified inertia basis rather than a modified gravity basis ; in that case the original mond formula is correct for circular orbits in galaxies , the theory would become strongly non - local , the conservation laws would become unusual , and the potential - density approach used hereafter would not apply to that framework .",
    "in the aquadratic lagrangian theory of mond by bekenstein & milgrom(1984 ) , the poisson equation reads @xmath11 = \\grad^2 \\phi_n = 4 \\pi g \\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the same interpolating function as in eq.([eqn : mueq ] ) .",
    "we then have @xmath13 the value of the curl field depends on the boundary conditions , but vanishes in spherical symmetry where gauss theorem applies and eq.([eqn : mueq ] ) is recovered . in realistic geometries , the curl field is non - zero but small ( see brada & milgrom 1995 , 1999 ; ciotti et al .",
    "2006 ) , leading to small differences when computing the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , bekenstein s relativistic mond ( bekenstein 2004 ) is a tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory : the tensor is an einstein metric @xmath14 out of which is built the usual einstein - hilbert action .",
    "@xmath15 is a dynamical normalized vector field ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is a dynamical scalar field .",
    "the action is the sum of the einstein - hilbert action for the tensor @xmath18 , the matter action , the action of the vector field @xmath15 , and the action of the scalar field @xmath17 .",
    "einstein - like equations are obtained for each of these fields by varying the action w.r.t .",
    "each of them .    in teves ,",
    "the physical metric near a quasi - static galaxy is given by the same metric as in general relativity , with the newtonian potential @xmath19 replaced by the total potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the scalar field @xmath17 plays the role of the dark matter gravitational potential .",
    "the einstein - like equation for the scalar field relates it to the newtonian potential @xmath19 ( generated by the baryonic density @xmath22 ) through the equation @xmath23 = \\grad^2 \\phi_n = 4 \\pi g \\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a function of the scalar field strength @xmath25 , and derives from a free function in the action of the scalar field .",
    "[ sec : inter ]    in spherical symmetry , we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the interpolating function of mond , thus related to @xmath24 by @xmath28 the standard interpolating function that has been used for twenty years to fit the rotation curves with eq.(1 ) is ( x ) = x .",
    "however , zhao & famaey ( 2006 ) have shown that this function , or rather the corresponding function @xmath24 derived from eq.([eqn : mus ] ) , is not physical in the framework of teves ; the function @xmath24 is multi - valued .",
    "for this reason , we will use hereafter a parametric set of interpolating functions that are physical in teves : [ eqn : mux ] ( x ) = 2x 1 + ( 2- ) x + ,   0 1 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding scalar field functions are [ eqn : musalph ] _",
    "s(s ) = s 1-s , where @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 case corresponds to the toy model proposed by bekenstein ( 2004 ) in weak and intermediate gravity . under the approximation of eq.(1 ) , the @xmath32 model has been shown by famaey & binney ( 2005 ) and zhao & famaey ( 2006 ) to be a better fit to the rotation curves of galaxies than the @xmath31 case .",
    "the values @xmath33 have not yet been explored in real galaxies , and will be the subject of another paper ( famaey , gentile & zhao 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "these functions @xmath27 and @xmath24 will lead to the same gravitational behaviour in spherical symmetry .",
    "however , note that eq.([eqn : mus ] ) is not valid in a more general geometry : the newtonian force , the mond force of bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) and the teves force are no longer parallel .",
    "the curl field obtained when solving the equation for the scalar field @xmath17 ( eq . [ eqn : poisson ] ) will be different than the one obtained when solving for the full @xmath34 in eq.([eqn : modpoi ] ) .",
    "this will be illustrated in  7 .",
    "[ sec : spherpot ]    in this section , we consider only the @xmath32 case , known to yield excellent fits to the rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "potential - density pairs ( e.g. , hernquist 1990 , dehnen 1993 , zhao 1995 ) have long been acknowledged to be very useful in model building and in checking numerical simulations .",
    "it is even more interesting to find simple spherical and non - spherical models in mond and teves .",
    "we explore a spherical model with a scalar field of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a dimensionless number , and @xmath37 then we have , according to the equation for the scalar field ( eq .

    "this mondian density distribution is realistic : the model mimics the sersic profile of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "it also mimics a hernquist ( 1990 ) model with scalelength @xmath41 : @xmath42 we can then also easily derive @xmath43 , and from eq.([eqn : mus1 ] ) calculate the newtonian and total potential of the model : _",
    "n(r ) = - ( r ) , ( r ) = v_0 ^ 2 ( 1 + r p r_0 ) .",
    "[ eqn : phirho ] thus , for the gravity we have @xmath44 the corresponding matter density ( baryons + dm ) in the newtonian framework is [ eq : density ] ( r ) + _ dm(r)= m_0 ( 1 + 2pr_0 r)4r_0 ( pr_0+r)^2 .",
    "the asymptotic circular velocity is @xmath45 , and the maximum gravity @xmath46 occurs at small r ( near the origin ) , where @xmath47 ( note that in the flattened models of  7 @xmath46 will be related to p by @xmath48 ) .",
    "given this , it is interesting to show the spherical model with p=0.5 and 2.0 , hence the intermediate gravity range @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( figs . 1 - 4 ) .",
    "most bulges and ellipticals , gravitational lenses and galaxy clusters should go through this intermediate regime , while dwarf spheroidal galaxies have very low @xmath51 .",
    "although a detailed fit to observed light profile is beyond the scope of the present paper , we will show an application in galaxy clusters in  5 .",
    "[ sec : bardist ]    it is interesting to ask if the mondian potential - density pairs presented in the previous section can be realised by some equilibrium configurations described by certain baryonic distribution functions self - consistently .",
    "this can be done in exactly the same way as in newtonian gravity .",
    "this is particularly simple for a system with constant radial anisotropy such that the radial velocity dispersion @xmath52 is related to the tangential dispersions by @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the baryonic phase - space distribution @xmath54 for the distribution function must take the form : f ( e , l ) = a(e ) 4 l , a(e ) -d ( r ) d |_=e .",
    "knowing from eq.([eqn : phirho ] ) that r()= p r_0 ( -1 ) , we obtain @xmath55 \\protect\\label{eqn : sigr } \\eeq where $ s \\equiv 1 + 2 p + { 2 r \\over r_0}$.   a likewise expression can be found by calculating the moments from the distribution function $ f(e , l)$.",
    "an interesting feature of this model is that it has { \\it nearly isothermal } velocity dispersions everywhere for any value of the parameter $ p$.   fig.(\\ref{fig : asig1 } ) shows $ \\sigma_r(r)$ for the two limiting cases of $ p=0 $ and $ p=\\infty$.   to understand this note that at large radii $ \\rho \\sim r^{-4}$ , $ v_{\\rm c } \\rightarrow v_0 $ and $ \\sigma_r^2 \\rightarrow { v_0 ^ 2 \\over 3}$.   at small radii , $ r \\rho \\rightarrow cst$ , and $ \\sigma_r^2(0 ) = ( p+1)v_0 ^ 2\\left [ 3/4+p/2 + p(p/2 + 1 ) \\ln{p \\over p+1 } \\right ] =   0.75v_0 ^ 2,~0.470v_0 ^ 2,0.421v_0 ^ 2,0.383v_0 ^ 2,0.333v_0 ^ 2 $ for   $ p=0,0.5,1,2,\\infty$.   so for all plausible values of p , $ \\sigma_r^2 $ is very comparable at the center and at large radii .",

    "we showed that the lensing and the orbits in these spherical or flattened models are rather similar to the expectation in einstein - newton gravity , but still trigger a few surprises in extreme geometries . in multi - centred models , the convergence map does not always reflect the projected matter in the lens plane in mond .",
    "this cautions simple interpretations of the analysis of weak lensing in the bullet cluster 1e 0657 - 56 ( clowe et al .",

    "however , the differences are probably not sufficient to solve the mondian mass discrepancy in galaxy clusters ( sanders 2003 ) as suggested by bekenstein ( 2005 ) , unless other parameters of the teves theory , e.g. , @xmath88 ( see eq .",
