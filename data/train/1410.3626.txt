    "there are several suggested systems hosting mbss such as @xmath4 wave superconductors@xcite , topological insulator / superconductor heterostructures@xcite , semiconductor / superconductor junctions with strong spin - orbit interaction@xcite , helical superconductors@xcite , and superconducting topological insulators@xcite .",
