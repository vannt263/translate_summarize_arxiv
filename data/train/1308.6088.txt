    "it is well established that a sizable fraction of the integrated light of stellar populations comes from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase @xcite . however , the size of this fraction has been subject of much discussion in the recent literature , with evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models of galaxies favouring either `` heavy '' @xcite or `` light '' @xcite flux contributions from tp - agb stars .",
    "efforts to account for the tp - agb contribution to the integrated light of galaxies are based on two different techniques :    \\1 ) eps models based on the isochrone method @xcite start by adopting the best - available sets of evolutionary tracks and isochrones including the tp - agb phase . since this phase is notoriously challenging to model  due to difficulties and uncertainties in the description of mixing , energy transport by convection , mass loss , and numerical aspects  at present",
    "there is no set of widely - accepted tp - agb model grids in the literature .",
    "therefore , in general , the choice falls on models which at least try to reproduce basic observables of tp - agb stars in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this approach has been adopted in the popular @xcite and @xcite models , with some subtle technical differences and a posteriori corrections  to consider e.g.  circumstellar dust @xcite or shifts in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 of tp - agb models @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) eps models by @xcite , based on the fuel consumption theorem ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter fct ) , bypass the use of tp - agb evolutionary tracks and stellar isochrones , since they are rooted in the belief that detailed modelling of the tp - agb evolution is hopelessly uncertain to be useful in this context .",
    "each single - burst stellar population is simply assigned , as a function of age , the tp - agb `` fuel '' that appears to best reproduce the tp - agb luminosity contribution measured in mc clusters .",
    "besides the integrated fuel as a function of stellar age , the fct method employs other prescriptions , such as the fraction of fuel burnt by c- and m - type stars , and some rough dependence on metallicity .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling and disturbing that , despite the efforts of calibrating these eps models on tp - agb data in the mc clusters ( albeit with different approaches ) , when taken without their `` corrections '' , the same eps models tend to overestimate the contribution of the tp - agb to the spectral energy distributions of galaxies .",
    "for instance , @xcite models , based on the fct recipe , show an excess of tp - agb flux which is not observed in post - starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "likewise , @xcite evolutionary tracks predict @xmath5 more agb stars than observed in a sample of nearby galaxies observed with hst , which translates to a factor @xmath0 excess in their integrated near - infrared flux @xcite .",
    "in this study we analyse a specific evolutionary effect which we identify as the likely reason for this unexpected incongruity .",
    "we start describing in detail how the tp - agb integrated luminosity is predicted to vary with age ( sect .",
    "[ models ] ) .",
    "we find a significant boosting of the tp - agb contribution  not predicted by the fct  at ages @xmath6  gyr , that coincides with the age interval populated by some of the most massive clusters in the mcs ( sect .",

    "the far - reaching consequences and implications in the context of the tp - agb calibration are discussed in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "to explore the detailed contribution of tp - agb stars to the integrated light of a ssp , we have computed a dense grid of stellar evolutionary tracks , assuming an initial composition with metallicity @xmath7 , helium abundance @xmath8 , and a scaled - solar distribution of metals ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath9}}={\\mbox{\\rm [ { \\rm m}/{\\rm h}]}}=-0.40 $ ] , which is suitable to describe intermediate - age clusters in the lmc .",
    "stellar evolutionary tracks were computed with the parsec code @xcite until the first thermal pulse on the tp - agb , and then followed with the colibri code @xcite until the complete ejection of the stellar envelope .",
    "tracks are closely distributed in initial mass @xmath10 , with a spacing @xmath11  in the proximity of the limiting maximum mass , @xmath12 , for a star to develop an electron - degenerate he - core after the main sequence ( ms ; with @xmath13  in this case ) . for low - mass stars ( those with @xmath14 ) , the evolution from the he - flash to the initial stage of quiescent he core - burning ( cheb ) is skipped by means of a standard and well - tested algorithm that preserves the stellar core mass and chemical profile , while converting part ot the helium in the core into carbon to take into account the nuclear energy necessary to lift the electron degeneracy .",
    "convective core overshooting is adopted with an efficiency as detailed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we completely suppress breathing pulses towards the end of cheb phase , so as to avoid erratic track - to - track fluctuations in the cheb lifetimes .",
    "evolutionary tracks are shown in the initial mass versus age (  vs. @xmath15 ) plots of fig .",
    "[ fig_taum ] , color - coded as a function of the evolutionary phase ( left panel ) or luminosity ( right panel ) .",
    "the inverse power - law relation between the initial mass and ms lifetime is clearly recognizable in the plot , as is the presence of a long - lived red giant branch ( rgb ) for masses @xmath16 .",
    "also evident is that the cheb lifetime suddenly gets longer at @xmath17 , passing from the @xmath18  yr typical of low - mass stars to at least twice this value at @xmath19  .",
    "this abrupt growth reflects the onset of cheb at significantly lower core masses and luminosities , compared to the case of low - mass stars .",
    "these features are well - established and their consequences to the cheb phase are thoroughly discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we notice how brief the typical lifetime of the tp - agb phase ( a few @xmath20  yr ) is compared to the cheb lifetime , and its relatively narrow dynamical range over the relevant mass interval .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_taum ] a few horizontal lines are drawn to highlight the evolutionary phases intersected by the stellar _ isochrones _ at some selected ages :    * the youngest isochrone , of @xmath21  gyr , crosses the ms , a very short section of `` rgb '' ( actually , this is just the quick core contraction phase that precedes he - ignition in a non - degenerate core ) , a long section of cheb , the early - agb ( e - agb ) , and the tp - agb . * similarly , the same phases are crossed by the 1.68-gyr isochrone , with the difference that its rgb is somewhat longer ( in terms of the spanned  interval ) and more luminous , while the cheb is shorter . * at 1.55 gyr , the isochrone intercepts both a section of low - mass and bright cheb , and a section of higher - mass ( and fainter ) cheb .",
    "this is the age range in which the most rapid changes in cheb morphology take place .",
    "* at 1.63 gyr , the isochrone crosses three distinct tp - agb phases ( as well as three e - agbs ) , the first at @xmath22  , the second ( somewhat shorter ) at @xmath23  , and the third at @xmath24  .",
    "the second tp - agb section raises quickly from below to above the 1.63  gyr line , so it is likely less populated than the other two .",
    "it is somewhat obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig_taum ] that the numbers of tp - agb stars will be `` boosted '' in isochrones with ages between 1.57 and 1.66  gyr , since they will all contain at least two well populated tp - agbs .",
    "since the two branches have similar ( and high ) luminosities , their total integrated fluxes will be boosted as well .",
    "a rough estimate of the boosting factor comes from the integral of @xmath10 , weighted by the imf , along the sections of the isochrone lines that correspond to the tp - agbs . given the limited range of masses involved",

    "let us now look at this problem in terms of the luminosity contribution of tp - agb stars , @xmath25 , to the integrated bolometric light of a single - burst stellar population ( ssp ) as a function of its age @xmath15 .    as a first step ,",
    "let us consider the integrated emitted energy of stellar tracks from their birth line on the pre - ms , up to any given evolutionary stage @xmath26 : @xmath27 figure  [ fig_fuelm ] shows this quantity as a function of the initial stellar mass , as obtained from our set of evolutionary tracks , and it is color - coded as a function of the main evolutionary stages .",
    "we can appreciate that the total emitted energy is a quite well - behaved function of .",
    "the most notable feature in this plot is the presence of a significant contribution from the rgb at masses @xmath16 , which is counterbalanced by an increase in the cheb and tp - agb contributions at @xmath17 . except for these aspects ,",
    "the run of the emitted energy with mass is quite smooth and covers a remarkably limited range .",
    "for this particular set of tracks , the total post - ms emitted energy amounts to @xmath28  gyr , with the tp - agb contribution ranging from @xmath29 to @xmath30  gyr , depending on the stellar mass .",
    "let us now look at the ssp integrated luminosity as derived from the isochrones , @xmath31 where @xmath32 initial mass function ( in this case",
    "the * ? ? ?",
    "* with a low - mass cut at @xmath33  ) . this quantity is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelt ] , as a function of age , and again separating the contribution from different evolutionary stages . notice the significant increase of the total tp - agb luminosity contribution at ages between @xmath34 and 1.66  gyr , the unequivocal evidence of the `` agb boosting '' that originates from the multiple tp - agbs at those ages .",
    "moreover , notice that there is a period between 1.40  gyr and 1.55  gyr during which the increase in luminosity due to the appearance of the rgb is not compensated by a decrease in the tp - agb luminosity , so that also in this interval there is a temporary but more modest increase in the total emitted luminosity . only for",
    "ages older than 1.66  gyr the evolution of the total luminosity seems to recover again the smooth trend defined by ages younger than 1.40  gyr .",
    "the figure also contains some mild irregularities , especially at the end of the tp - agb phase , which derive either from the small variations in the rate at which agb stars are produced after the cheb phase , or from the variable numbers of thermal pulses occurring in the single tp - agb evolutionary tracks .",
    "anyway , these fluctuations are small and not of concern here .",
    "the most significant point , in the context of this study , is the presence of the agb - boosting period between @xmath34 and 1.66  gyr .",
    "as already mentioned , the agb - boosting period derives from the sudden increase of the cheb lifetime at @xmath35 , that causes single isochrones to cross multiple sections of the tp - agb phase experienced by stars with slightly different initial masses .",
    "approximations which do not take into account these different cheb lifetimes and how they reflect into isochrones , are not expected to show this feature . in particular , the fct ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) approximates the evolution of @xmath36 with the following equation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the integrated luminosity of the ms .",
    "all the subsequent evolutionary stages are described by a single track of mass equal to the turn - off one , @xmath39 , uniformly weighted by the evolutionary rate at which stars with @xmath40 leave the ms , @xmath41 .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelt ] shows the result of applying equation  [ ltpagb_fct ] , where the functions @xmath42 ( equivalent to `` tables of fuel '' ) are obtained from the evolutionary tracks , and are shown in our previous fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelm ] .",
    "we adopt the same layout as in the left panel , showing the contribution of every evolutionary phase to the integrated light with a different color .",
    "evidently there is no sign of an agb - boosting period in this case .",
    "the reason of such a remarkable difference in the predictions between the isochrone and fct methods can be easily caught considering that , to describe the post - ms phases of a ssp , the fct assumes a perfectly one - to - one correspondence between age - index and mass - index ( ms lifetime of a star with mass @xmath43 ) , while the isochrone method populates each phase by a finite range of initial stellar masses .",
    "it follows that the fct approximation constrains any ssp to cross a given post - ms phase not more than once ( exemplified by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_taum ] ) , while multiple crossings may , in principle , take place with the isochrone method ( represented by e.g.  the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_taum ] ) .    of the two approaches shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelt ] , the one based on isochrones ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is certainly best suited to represent the time evolution of single - burst stellar populations  defined as generations of stars born at the same time and sharing the same age @xmath15  alike small - mass star clusters .",
    "it is also the one that turns out to capture most details of the ssp luminosity evolution .",
    "this is not the first time that the agb boosting at ages close to 1.6  gyr has been noticed . using isochrones derived from evolutionary tracks computed with a coarser mass resolution",
    ", @xcite already noticed a temporary increase in the tp - agb production rate due to the flattening of the @xmath44 versus  relation ( where @xmath44 is the age at the end of the cheb phase ) close to .",
    "the increase was in proportion to @xmath45 , and appeared as a sharp , short - lived peak in the time evolution of integrated colors such as @xmath46 .",
    "this feature has been present in many sets of the padova isochrones distributed since 2000 @xcite , and often is considered to be a bug by external users . by conveniently sampling a grid of isochrone ages one could completely eliminate it from the data .",
    "the feature we identify and discuss in this work is essentially the same one , but this time it has been derived from a much more detailed and denser grid of stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "what was seen as a sharp peak in the production of agb stars appearing at a precise age by @xcite , it now appears as a triple tp - agb over a relatively wide age interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelt ] ) .",
    "let us give a closer look at this point .",
    "[ fig_resolu ] illustrates essentially the same features as in the previous figs .",
    "[ fig_taum ] and [ fig_fuelt ] , but now using grids of evolutionary tracks of progressively worse mass resolution .",
    "these degraded grids are obtained from the high - resolution grid already described , by progressively eliminating tracks in the vicinity of the 1.76  one .",
    "interpolated tracks and isochrones are then obtained using exactly the same algorithms as before .",
    "four different resolutions are presented , namely @xmath11 , 0.02 , 0.04 and 0.08  , the first one being the original case already presented in previous figs .",
    "[ fig_taum ] to [ fig_fuelt ] .",
    "the presence of the 1.76  track ensures that , in all cases , we sample the maximum of he - burning lifetimes that occurs slightly above .    for the @xmath47 and @xmath48  cases ,",
    "the mass resolution is still good enough for a triple tp - agb to appear in the isochrones ( top - middle panels ) , although for a reduced age interval . as a consequence",
    ", the agb - boosting period continues to appear in the integrated light ( bottom - middle panels ) , but confined to a smaller age range , _ and with a larger amplitude_. the larger amplitude is simply caused by the fact that tp - agb stars from a wider range of initial masses now appear in a narrower range of isochrone ages . in the case of the @xmath47  resolution , the effect is not dramatic , and the evolution of integrated light resembles very much the one obtained for the @xmath11  case . for @xmath48  , however , the agb - boosting appears over an age range of just @xmath49  gyr , and with a amplitude about 2.5  times larger than the one seen at @xmath11  .    for the @xmath50  case , instead",
    ", the situation is apparently very different .",
    "there is no longer any single isochrone crossing three different tp - agb sections ( as seen in the top - right panel ) .",
    "but anyway , an intense agb - boosting period still appears , and at slightly later ages than before .",
    "this happens because there is an age interval ( between 1.66 and 1.73  gyr ) in which the isochrones cross a larger interval of  while on the tp - agb phase .",
    "this is actually the situation which was found by @xcite , and explained by means of the higher production rate of agb stars ( proportional to @xmath45 ) occurring in this age range .",
    "it is obvious that , in addition to the four cases illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_resolu ] , all sorts of intermediate situations may be created , depending on how well the mass interval around  is sampled by the stellar evolutionary tracks that are used to build isochrones .",
    "it may also be that different sets of evolutionary tracks , when produced at a @xmath51  resolution as our own , will reveal a more gradual change in the evolutionary features across .",
    "this does not imply that such tracks will avoid the agb - boosting phase , since as demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_resolu ] , the agb - boosting period can be generated even if the cheb burning lifetimes change over a mass interval as wide as @xmath50  .",
    "more generally , we can affirm that _ as long as the cheb burning lifetime increases with mass above , in a way that largely compensates for the decrease in main - sequence and rgb lifetimes over the same interval , the agb - boosting period has to occur_. fig .",
    "[ fig_resolu ] , and the simpler arguments in @xcite , show this clearly .",
    "this effect can be eliminated only if we get rid of the increase in cheb burning lifetimes occurring above , or , alternatively , if incomplete descriptions of the light evolution of ssps ( as the one provided by the fct ) are adopted , as shown in our previous fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelt ] .      from the previous discussion ,",
    "it is clear that the present results are a consequence of the abrupt changes in the evolutionary features at @xmath35 , as the electron degeneracy no longer develops in the core before he ignition : over a small interval of , the shortening of the rgb lifetime is followed by an abrupt reduction in the luminosity at which the he - burning phase takes place , that in turns causes a sharp increase of its lifetime .",
    "these changes in the cheb lifetime and luminosity have been found in many other sets of evolutionary tracks since @xcite , as in e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the appendix provides a more extensive comparison between different sets of tracks , revealing that the large increase on the cheb burning lifetimes above  is not only a common feature in the tracks where the he - burning evolution is computed , but is also expected from the conditions at the stage of he - ignition , in nearly all sets of tracks computed up to that stage .",
    "indeed , it seems well accepted @xcite that the longer cheb burning lifetimes slightly above  derive from the smaller core masses ( and hence smaller initial he - burning luminosities ) at he - ignition , in these stars .    in addition",
    ", we recall that the same changes in core masses and he - burning luminosities at  are at the origin of the appearance of secondary and dual red clumps , that are nowadays well observed in the milky way and other local group galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and even in a few populous mc star clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , the agb - boosting effect is not a feature that pertains to a single , isolated set of evolutionary tracks .",
    "moreover , our estimates of the emitted light ( or fuel ) _ as a function of the stellar initial mass _ are well in line with the behaviour suggested by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the agb - boosting feature does not take place when we consider the behaviour of the evolutionary tracks as a function of the initial stellar mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelm ] ) .",
    "it only shows up if we look at the emitted light _ as a function of the age _ ,",
    "provided we can count on stellar isochrones with a high age ( and mass ) resolution ( as in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuelt ] , and in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_resolu ] ) .",
    "the previous analysis has demonstrated the expected appearance of triple tp - agb branches at ages @xmath2  gyr .",
    "we designate this effect with the generic name of `` agb boosting '' instead of simply `` agb triplication '' , because details about its duration and `` boosting factor '' may well change as more detailed evolutionary tracks are computed .",
    "but we emphasize that  as demonstrated in the previous section  as long as the cheb lifetimes sharply increase above , an agb - boosting period _ has _ to occur .",
    "the agb - boosting phase is a temporary feature , preceded and followed by a smoothly - varying light contribution from tp - agb stars .",
    "it can not last much longer than 0.1  gyr ( again depending on details of evolutionary tracks ) , as we can infer from figs .",
    "[ fig_taum ] and [ fig_resolu ] . in the wider context of galactic evolution , this is a short - lived feature , and one may wonder whether it could be affecting the conclusions of eps models in any significant way .",
    "should not this feature be completely smeared out when convolved with the continuous star - formation histories typical of star - forming galaxies ?    and indeed , we believe this feature _ is _ smeared out in most nearby galaxies .",
    "its critical importance resides in the fact that it affects , in a significant way , the mc clusters which are _ the classical calibrators _ of the contribution of tp - agb stars to eps models .     vs.  age plane ,",

    "on the other hand , removing these clusters from the calibration sample used to constrain tp - agb models would be detrimental , since this would dramatically reduce the numbers of observed tp - agb stars at our disposal .",
    "moreover , the remaining clusters in the @xcite catalog ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically contain very few tp - agb stars per cluster ( less than 5 , except for ngc  1978 which has 12 , at an age of 2  gyr ) , and hence are strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations in their star counts and integrated colors .",
    "the broad implication of our findings is that present models calibrated on mc clusters may be significantly overestimating the tp - agb flux contribution to models of distant galaxies .",
    "precise numerical estimates of the excess factors are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "anyway , the way for improving this situation is quite clear to us :    \\(1 ) the data for tp - agb stars in intermediate - age star clusters in the magellanic clouds should be carefully revised , in view of re - deriving the lifetimes and integrated flux of their tp - agb stars . simply making plots of",
    "agb star counts normalized to the @xmath53-band cluster luminosity @xcite and integrated colours @xcite versus a rough estimate of cluster age , with clusters binned into wide age bins , is not enough .",
    "it is necessary to locate the exact position of each cluster with respect to the agb - boosting period .",
    "approximations based on the fuel - consumption theorem are also to be avoided . describing the post - ms evolution of a given age with a single track with initial mass @xmath43 , the fct is not able , by construction , to cross any evolutionary phase more than once  nor , more generally , to take into account any temporary increase in the rate of production of stars in post - ms stages due to changes in the post - ms lifetimes ( as in the effect described by * ? ? ?",
    "in order to correctly take into account the agb - boosting effect , it is absolutely necessary ( a ) to model every cluster cmd using detailed isochrones calculated from tracks with a very fine mass resolution , ( b ) to precisely identify the actual turn - off mass , and its distribution in the clusters with multiple turn - offs .",
    "this may not be an easy task .",
    "hst - quality photometry is needed , as well as a careful consideration of effects such as incompleteness , crowding , mass segregation , and the field contamination .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrate that such an accurate work of model fitting is not beyond reach .",
    "\\(2 ) in the absence of a representative sample of star clusters well distributed in age and containing large numbers of tp - agb stars , the use of galaxy fields to estimate the tp - agb contribution appears legitimate  at least , their more continuous star formation history ( sfh ) would ensure that they are less affected by the agb - boosting effect than the present samples of mc clusters .",
    "the basic requirement for a quantitative work is having reliable estimates of the galaxy sfhs .",
    "this is the case of post - starburst galaxies @xcite , and of many nearby galaxies presently sampled with deep ground - based and hst photometry ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is also clear that when looking at entire galaxies , one will inevitably miss many of the details of the tp - agb evolution that we would like to constrain .",

    "the best mass resolution available in the literature .",
    "any comparison with other authors is very much limited by this fact .",

    "in addition , the luminosities provided by the he - burning core at different stages of the cheb evolution are plotted with dotted lines ( for @xmath65 , 0.7 , 0.5 , 0.3 , and 0.1 , from bottom to top ) . *",
    "top panel : * the mass of the h - exhausted core at the beginning of the cheb phase ( red ) .",
    "the dotted lines denote the increased core mass at successive stages of the cheb evolution ( for @xmath66 decreasing from 0.95 to 0.1 from bottom to top , as before ) . ]",
    "as already discussed , the agb - boosting owns its origin to the sharp increase in cheb burning lifetimes at masses close to .",
    "this increase is further illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ourlifetimes ] , which details how the relevant lifetimes change with the stellar initial mass .",
    "more specifically , we plot the run of the `` rgb lifetime '' , @xmath67 , measuread as the time span between the h - exhaustion in the core ( @xmath68 ) and the maximum luminosity reached soon after he - ignition , and the run of the he - burning lifetime , @xmath69 , measured as the time span between the he - ignition and the he - exhaustion in the core ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "it can be seen that both quantities gradually change as  approaches the  limit , but the change becomes rather abrupt as  is crossed .",
    "similar changes occur also in the maximum and minimum luminosities reached at the initial stages of he - burning , denoted as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "it is remarkable that the quantities at the rgb tip , @xmath67 and @xmath63 ( both marked in red ) , are derived from stellar models computed on a consistent way from the pre - main sequence up to the he - ignition , therefore they are _ not affected _ by the artificial method performed to build quiescent he - burning models of masses @xmath16 .",
    "the same applies to the core mass at he - ignition , which is measured at a stage in which it is still not altered by the he - burning .",
    "nonetheless , all models indicate the same discontinuity at @xmath71 , namely a sharp decrease in both @xmath67 , @xmath63 , and @xmath72 . this sharp decrease is clearly indicating a discontinuity caused by the stellar physics , rather than by the numerical algorithms adopted to skip the he - flash in low - mass models .      and",
    "indeed , the diagram of central temperature vs.  central density shown in fig .  [ fig_bifu ] shows a clear bifurcation in the evolutionary paths , that sharply separates the models with @xmath74  from those with @xmath75  .",
    "the former ignite helium in non - degenerate conditions , while the latter decisely cool at increasing density , delaying he - ignition to a stage further along in the rgb .",
    "this bifurcation has been found in numerous sets of published stellar tracks in the past .",
    "what is unusual is just to show it with a mass resolution as small as @xmath11  , as in our case .",
    "after he - ignition , low - mass models have their evolution interrupted and continued from a zero - age - horizontal branch model built with a suitable mass and chemical composition ( see sect .  [ models ] ) , while intermediate - mass models are continuously computed until the tp - agb phase .",
    "this dichotomy in the way models are evolved could create additional differences between the two mass ranges ( in addition to those caused by the onset of electron degeneracy ) , because the convective regions developed in the core during he - ignition could have been treated differently in the two cases . especially worrying would be if the overshooting scheme adopted in the tracks were to extend the convective cores in the models just massive enough to survive the he - flash . however ,",
    "inspection of the models shows that the convective cores of low - mass cheb models are larger than those of he - burning stars above the @xmath71 discontinuity ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ourlifetimes ] ) .",
    "this is simply due to the larger h - exhausted cores of the former models , which are a common feature , irrespective of the adopted efficiency of core overshoot and of the way they have been computed . in spite of that , in models with mass just above the discontinuity the he - burning lifetimes is about twice that of the @xmath14 models .",
    "again this feature is common to all models  irrespective of the efficiency of core overshooting  and due to the lower he - burning luminosity which is needed to sustain a smaller he core , i.e.  to the he - core mass  luminosity relation .",
    "the latter can be appreciated by looking at the luminosity coming from he - burning reactions , @xmath76 , at several stages of the cheb evolution ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ourlifetimes ] ) .",
    "@xmath76 is indeed dramatically smaller for the cheb models with the core mass close to the @xmath77  minimum , soon after he - ignition ( as for the curves with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) . at later stages of cheb ,",
    "the core masses grow and the differences between the @xmath76 values between tracks of varying masses become smaller ( as seen in the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_ourlifetimes ] ) ,",
    "but anyway the very different @xmath76 at the start of the cheb ensure the much longer lifetimes of the models slightly above @xmath17 .",
    "thus , no matter the way the models have been computed , a discontinuity in the he core masses gives rise to a discontinuity in the he - burning lifetimes , with models possessing smaller cores having significantly prolonged @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig_otherlifetimes ] .",
    "the comparison is performed as a function of @xmath83 , because convective overshooting has the effect of systematically increasing the core masses and hence of reducing the value of  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , we will be using @xmath83 as a proxy for the core mass developed after the main sequence , so that we can directly compare  at least in the vicinity of   models which naturally develop very different core masses .",
    "since the definition of  might slightly differ from author to author , we simply redefine  for each set , as being the mass value that presents the fastest variation of the quantity @xmath63 with mass .",
    "@xcite were the first to explore the issue of how fast is the transition in evolutionary features across , in the context of the long - sought `` rgb phase transition '' defined by @xcite .",
    "they computed a series of canonical ( without overshooting ) models at a typical separation of @xmath84  , but only up to the he - ignition .",
    "it can be seen that the behaviour of the present models is quite similar to those of @xcite , apart from modest offsets in the plotted luminosities and lifetimes , and for @xcite models suggesting a more gradual variation of the stellar properties for masses above @xmath12 .",
    "the offsets in luminosities and lifetimes are no surprise , given the differences in the initial chemical composition , and the large changes in the physical input adopted by stellar models in the last two decades .",
    "particularly interesting is the comparison presented at the top panel , which presents the maximum mass coordinate of the maximum temperature reached inside the star before the he - flash , @xmath85 .",
    "a value larger than zero is usually interpreted as the signature of an electron - degenerate core , with its temperature inversion caused by the efficient conduction and by neutrino cooling .",
    "the mass at which @xmath85 becomes null has sometimes been used as a definition for  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that in our models @xmath85 becomes null already at @xmath86  , which is at least 0.03  smaller than the mass value for which the evolutionary features more rapidly change , .",
    "such a distinction between limiting masses could not have been detected in @xcite models , given their @xmath84  resolution .",
    "apart from this fine detail , the run of @xmath85 with mass is surprisingly similar between these two sets of models .",
    "the behaviour of @xcite models seem to be confirmed by those from @xcite and @xcite , although the latter are computed with a slightly worse resolution in mass . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite compute the complete he - burning evolution for models below and above the @xmath12 limit , finding that the cheb lifetime more than doubles for stars slightly more massive than @xmath12  as also found in our models .",
    "very similar behaviour is also presented by the garstec tracks from @xcite .",
    "also suggestive is the comparison between our models and some recent ones such as the yale - yonsei @xcite , basti @xcite , and dsep @xcite .",
    "these sets of models predict a quite similar evolution of the quantities at the he - ignition , although , in all these cases , the finest details of the transition at  are missed because of the limited mass resolution ( of about @xmath84  in the best case ) .    in the case of basti models",
    ", the comparison can be extended to the he - burning luminosities and lifetimes , which compare quite well . in basti ,",
    "the longest cheb burning lifetimes are found just a few hundredths of solar masses above   although this trend is not very clear give the scarcity of tracks computed in the immediate vicinity of .",
    "another interesting point is that the basti tracks present the same trend of presenting the smallest luminosities at he - ignition in the mass interval immediately above .",
    "this behaviour is probably reflecting the minimum in the core mass at he - ignition , which is also found in the same interval .",
    "similar trends are also observed in the dsep models , which behave in a way very similar to basti ones .",
    "unfortunately , dsep does not contain he - burning models in the immediate viciniy of , and largely fail to sample the mass interval for which he - burning lifetimes are expected to exceed 100  myr .",
    "overall , we find a good level of agreement between the behaviour of our models and others found in the literature , despite the great differences in parameters such as the overshooting efficiency , initial metallicity and helium content . since our models have by far the best mass resolution among these different sets , and are the most complete in the calculation of he - burning phases , it is natural that they provide the most detailed description of the @xmath87 interval .",
    "as surprising as it can be , they also provide the sharpest transition in the stellar evolutionary features across this mass interval ."

    "<S> in the recent controversy about the role of tp - agb stars in evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models of galaxies , one particular aspect is puzzling : tp - agb models aimed at reproducing the lifetimes and integrated fluxes of the tp - agb phase in magellanic cloud ( mc ) clusters , when incorporated into eps models , are found to overestimate , to various extents , the tp - agb contribution in resolved star counts and integrated spectra of galaxies . in this paper , we call attention to a particular evolutionary aspect , linked to the physics of stellar interiors , that in all probability is the main cause of this conundrum . as soon as stellar populations intercept the ages at which rgb stars first appear , a sudden and abrupt change in the lifetime of the core he - burning phase causes a temporary `` boost '' in the production rate of subsequent evolutionary phases , including the tp - agb . for a timespan of about 0.1  gyr , </S>",
    "<S> triple tp - agb branches develop at slightly different initial masses , causing their frequency and contribution to the integrated luminosity of the stellar population to increase by a factor of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the boost occurs for turn - off masses of @xmath1 , just in the proximity of the expected peak in the tp - agb lifetimes ( for mc metallicities ) , and for ages of @xmath2  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> coincidently , this relatively narrow age interval happens to contain the few very massive mc clusters that host most of the tp - agb stars used to constrain stellar evolution and eps models . </S>",
    "<S> this concomitance makes the agb - boosting particularly insidious in the context of present eps models . </S>",
    "<S> as we discuss in this paper , the identification of this evolutionary effect brings about three main consequences . </S>",
    "<S> first , we claim that present estimates of the tp - agb contribution to the integrated light of galaxies derived from mc clusters , are biased towards too large values . </S>",
    "<S> second , the relative tp - agb contribution of single - burst populations falling in this critical age range can not be accurately derived by approximations such as the fuel consumption theorem , that ignore , by construction , the above evolutionary effect . </S>",
    "<S> third , a careful revision of agb star populations in intermediate - age mc clusters is urgently demanded , promisingly with the aid of detailed sets of stellar isochrones . </S>"
