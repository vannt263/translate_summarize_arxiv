    "our assumptions on @xmath11 and @xmath13 imply that @xmath702 .",
    "given @xmath241 we write @xmath703 it follows easily from the definitions that @xmath338 is an interval of length @xmath704 .",
    "if @xmath705 , then we denote by @xmath21 a marked interval in @xmath697 with length @xmath706 where we mark the left ( respectively right ) vertex if and only if the left ( respectively right ) vertex of @xmath332 is marked .",
    "after possibly translating @xmath21 by an integer we then have @xmath707 .",
    "now we consider the case that @xmath708 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath263 are alternating between @xmath639 and @xmath709 . since @xmath702",
    "we deduce that @xmath293 is even .",
    "it follows easily from corollary  [ cor : distinct ] that both end points of @xmath332 are not marked unless @xmath710 and at least one of @xmath711 or @xmath712 is equal to @xmath713 .",
    "but this case does not occur , since such a group would be isomorphic to a baumslag - solitar group of the form @xmath691 .",
    "summarizing , we showed that @xmath332 is an interval of length one such that both end points are not marked . in this case",
    "we take @xmath21 to be the polytope which consists of a single not marked point .",
    "it is clear that this @xmath21 has the desired property and that it is unique up to translation .    for a @xmath1presentation as in proposition  [ prop : foxpolytope - b1 ]",
    "we now define @xmath7 to be the marked polytope that we found in that proposition .",
    "finally let @xmath179 be any @xmath1presentation where @xmath5 is non - trivial and cyclically reduced and with @xmath689 .",
    "we can apply the proof of lemma  [ lem : splittings1 ] verbatim to @xmath3 and we obtain a simple presentation @xmath714 where @xmath180 is non - trivial and cyclically reduced . if @xmath489 is not isomorphic to @xmath691 , then we define @xmath715 .",
    "now it is straightforward to verify that the statements of theorems [ mainthm ] , [ mainthm2 ] and [ mainthm3 ] also hold in this context .",
    "we leave the details to the reader .",
    "finally , note that it is not possible to find a marked polytope for the baumslag - solitar groups @xmath716 which satisfies the conclusions of theorems [ mainthm ] and [ mainthm3 ] . indeed , for theorem  [ mainthm3 ] to hold",
    "the polytope would have to consist of a single point .",
    "but the bieri  neumann ",
    "strebel invariant contains one epimorphism @xmath694 but not the other .",
    "so the one vertex of the polytope would have to be marked and not marked at the same time .",
    "given a group @xmath19 with a nice @xmath1presentation @xmath3 we used fox calculus to define a marked polytope @xmath7 that in particular determines the bieri  neumann ",
    "strebel invariant of @xmath4 .",

    "it remains an open problem to relate the polyhedral structure of the polytope @xmath512 to properties of the group @xmath717 and to extend the construction to more general classes of groups .",
    "we conclude this paper with several questions aimed at this .",
    "in theorem  [ mainthm3 ] we proved that if @xmath19 is residually a torsion - free elementary amenable group , then the thickness of @xmath512 for any epimorphism @xmath57 can be described purely in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath29 .",
    "this does not give an intrinsic definition of the polytope since by lemma  [ lem : addth ] ( 2 ) the thickness only determines the _ symmetrization _ of @xmath512 .",
    "the bieri  neumann ",
    "strebel - invariant @xmath28 can be identified with an open subset contained in the interior of the faces of @xmath718 moreover , the set of all points in @xmath28 corresponding to homomorphisms with finitely generated kernel is symmetric and open . in this way ,",
    "given an asymmetric marked polytope , the vertices determine a natural subdivision of some of the opposite faces , and hence a possibly finer polyhedral structure , with some open regions corresponding to finite generation .",
    "is it possible to assign to any finitely presented group a marked polytope which satisfies the conclusions of theorems [ mainthm ] and [ mainthm3 ] ?",
    "more modestly , one could ask for a marked polytope for groups with a presentation of deficiency one .",
    "if @xmath19 is a group with a 2dimensional eilenberg - maclane space of zero euler characteristic , then the approach of section  [ section : tg ] together with a variation on proposition  [ prop : invtofg ] will assign to @xmath19 a ( possibly empty ) polytope .",
    "however , if @xmath19 is not residually @xmath719 then it is unlikely that the polytope will have the desired properties .    over the last years a lot of effort has been put into understanding free - by - cyclic groups , i.e.   groups of the form @xmath720 where @xmath219 is a free group and @xmath721 is an isomorphism .",
    "these groups have a presentation of deficiency one , and they are residually @xmath37 by lemma  [ lem : zbyfree ] . the construction of section  [ section : tg ] will then actually give a non - empty polytope and it should be interesting to relate it to aspects of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath27 has the property that both @xmath29 and @xmath279 lie in @xmath28 , then both approaches ` see ' the function @xmath722 in a neighborhood of @xmath29 .    finally , let @xmath3 be a presentation such that each generator appears at least twice in the relators .",
    "( note that a nice @xmath1presentation is of that type . )",
    "given such a presentation @xmath3 turaev @xcite defined a seminorm on @xmath723 .",
