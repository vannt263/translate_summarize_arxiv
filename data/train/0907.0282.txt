    "in the current @xmath5cdm cosmological scenario , dark matter dominates the matter density in the universe , and luminous galaxies are thought to be formed within dark matter halos . however , detailed physical processes of galaxy formation , such as star formation and supernova feedback , are very complicated",
    ". different prescriptions of galaxy formation may lead to different relations between luminous galaxies and the underlying dark matter , or equivalently , different galaxy biases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the key to our understanding of galaxy formation is to study the galaxy bias both in theories and observations . if galaxy formation is mainly determined by local physical processes ( such as hydrodynamics ) , the galaxy bias is then a constant on large scales @xcite . in the first order ,",
    "the galaxy density fluctuation is proportional to that of the dark matter on large scales , @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficient here is usually called as the linear bias factor , @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to study its dependence on the luminosity , morphology , mass , and redshift of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , because this information provides important clues to how galaxies are formed .",
    "the bias factor @xmath2 and its relation with the scale @xmath7 can be determined directly from the ratios between the power spectra of galaxies ( @xmath8 ) and those of the underlying dark matter ( @xmath9 ) ,    @xmath10    where the higher - order terms are negligible .",
    "but it is important to note that the power spectrum of dark matter is usually not known in observations .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of @xmath11 can not be obtained through the above relation , unless the power spectrum of dark matter is measured from observations , such as future weak lensing surveys . from equation ( [ eqn : b1p ] )",
    ", we note that the bias factor @xmath2 actually couples with the properties of the large - scale matter density field , such as the linear rms fluctuation , @xmath12 . and",
    "it is impossible to break such degeneracy only by using the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "it is then challenging to determine the galaxy bias purely in observations .",
    "fortunately , there is a way of doing this by involving the second - order statistics , the bispectrum @xmath13 , or more conveniently the reduced bispectrum @xmath14 , which is defined by    @xmath15    where ( @xmath16 ) are the three sides of a triangle and @xmath17 is the corresponding power spectrum ( galaxy or dark matter ) . on sufficiently large scales where the density fluctuation is small , we can expand the galaxy density field @xmath18 in the taylor series of @xmath19 , which up to the second order can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath2 is the linear bias factor and @xmath3 is the first nonlinear bias factor .",
    "if we assume that the bias factors are deterministic , i.e. , constant @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we can derive the following relation from equation ( [ eqn : taylor ] ) by utilizing the reduced bispectra @xmath21 of galaxies and @xmath22 of dark matter(e.g . , @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath23    according to the second - order perturbation theory , the reduced bispectrum of dark matter @xmath24 can be predicted on large scales based on the measurement of galaxy power spectrum . in the second - order perturbation",
    "theory(hereafter pt2 ) , it gives @xcite    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denotes the mild dependence on cosmology and @xmath27 is the linear dark matter power spectrum .",
    "it is easy to see that within the tree - level pt , the reduced bispectrum @xmath24 does not depend on redshift or amplitude of the matter density fluctuation , but weakly depends on the cosmology , thus depends almost solely on the shape of the matter power spectrum .",
    "therefore , the reduced bispectrum @xmath24 , on large scales , can be predicted from the measurement of galaxy power spectrum , since the galaxy power spectrum @xmath8 has the same shape as the matter power spectrum @xmath9 ( they are proportional to each other on large scales ) .",
    "the bias factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 can then be determined from the measurement of @xmath21 and the prediction of @xmath22 , with at least two independent triangle configurations from the galaxy distribution .",
    "many more configurations are actually used in the real measurement , because the measurement errors are present . with the value of @xmath2",
    ", one can determine the amplitude of the linear density fluctuation from the galaxy distribution alone , which can thus become a potentially powerful way for dark energy study if the density fluctuation amplitude can be measured in this way for a few redshifts .",
    "the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 also contain very important information about the formation of galaxies .    with this method",
    ", @xcite measured the galaxy bias parameters using the observational data of 2df galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs ) .",
    "they found that the linear bias factor @xmath2 is consistent with unity and the quadratic bias parameter @xmath3 is consistent with zero .",
    "though the error bars of their measurements are also large , the results may still indicate that galaxies follow the distribution of dark matter .",
    "the range of scales assumed , however , was in the quasilinear and nonlinear regime ( @xmath28 ) . on these scales ,",
    "the second - order perturbation theory is already not accurate enough to predict the dark matter bispectrum , and even the bias expansion ( equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) ) may have already broken down , as we will show below .",
    "considering the potential applications of this method to constrain the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , the amplitude of the dark matter density distribution , the equation of state of dark energy ) from the measurement of @xmath2 , and to constrain theories of galaxy formation from measuring @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it is important to test whether and on which scale this method can produce an unbiased measurement of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . because the bias factors are generally dependent on the scale @xmath7(against the assumption of scale - invariant @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , we need to check the range of validity of equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) and at the same time , we have to make sure whether it is consistent with equation ( [ eqn : b1p ] ) .",
    "we should keep in mind that for this method to be valid , the prediction of @xmath22 must be accurate(i.e .",
    ", pt2 must be precise on large scales ) and the number density of galaxies can be expanded as in equations ( [ eqn : taylor ] ) and ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) .    in our companion paper@xcite , we have studied the accuracy of pt2 for the bispectrum of dark matter and we found that the pt2 prediction is not very accurate even on scales @xmath29 , and high - order loop corrections are needed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the current paper , we will focus on the second point , i.e. , on which scale @xmath18 can be expanded as in equation ( [ eqn : taylor ] ) .",
    "we generate a set of catalogs of mock galaxies from a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation",
    ". then we measure @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the galaxy reduced bispectrum .",
    "the obtained linear bias factor @xmath2 is compared with the expected value determined by the ratio of power spectra ( equation ( [ eqn : b1p ] ) ) in the numerical simulations .",
    "we will also demonstrate that an accurate prediction of the dark matter bispectrum is necessary for obtaining correct bias factors .",
    "we constrain our discussion only in the real space(relative to the redshift space ) to avoid the complicated observational effects .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows .",
    "we describe our simulations and galaxy mock catalogs in section [ simulations ] .",
    "the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias factors using bispectrum is displayed in section [ galaxybias ] .",
    "we use the halo model to study the influence of different components in section [ halomodel ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the cosmology considered here is a canonical spatially flat cold dark matter model with the density parameter @xmath30 , the cosmological constant @xmath31 , the hubble constant @xmath32 , and the baryon density parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the primordial density field is assumed to be gaussian with a scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath34@xmath7 .",
    "for the linear power spectrum , we generate it with the cmbfast code @xcite , and the normalization is set to @xmath35 , where @xmath12 is the present linear rms density fluctuation within a sphere of radius @xmath36 .",
    "cccccc 600 & @xmath37 & 3 & @xmath38 + 1200 & @xmath37 & 4 & @xmath39 [ tab : simu ]    we use an upgraded version of the particle - particle - particle - mesh ( @xmath40 ) code of @xcite to simulate structure formation in the universe .",
    "the code has now incorporated the multiple level @xmath40 gravity solver for high - density regions @xcite . in order to have a large mass resolution range , we run a total of @xmath41 simulations with @xmath37 particles in different simulation boxes , which we hereafter denote by @xmath42 and @xmath43 by different box sizes(table [ tab : simu ] )",
    "the simulations were run on an sgi altix 350 with 16 processors with openmp parallelization in shanghai astronomical observatory .",
    "dark matter halos are identified using the standard friends - of - friends(fof ) algorithm with a linking length @xmath44 equal to @xmath45 times the mean particle separation .",
    "unbound particles ( with positive binding energy ) are excluded to avoid contamination .",
    "the different resolutions of the simulations enable us to check the consistency among the results from simulations of different @xmath46 , as well as to investigate the behavior of bispectrum over a large dynamical range . here , we choose the fourier space bin scheme as @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 when measuring the bispectrum .    for the galaxy samples , we build our catalogs on the semi - analytical model of @xcite .",
    "they have generated the galaxy distribution in the millennium simulation with the box size @xmath51 on a side@xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in @xcite(@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath33 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) are not exactly the same as ours .",
    "but the slight difference in the parameters is not the focus in this paper , since an approximate relation connecting galaxies to dark matter is sufficient here . for each dark matter halo in our simulations ,",
    "we randomly choose a corresponding galaxy host halo of the same mass from the galaxy catalog of @xcite .",
    "one thing to note is that the virial masses of the halos in @xcite are defined by the spherical overdensity approach , which makes their final halo masses about @xmath56 times smaller than those of our corresponding fof halos .",
    "we adjust the masses of @xcite halos , so they would match our halo definitions .",
    "after the adjustment , we put those galaxies of the host halos of @xcite into our corresponding dark matter halos , while preserving the same relative positions to the halo centers . finally , we obtain the corresponding distributions of galaxies in our simulations , as well as their properties , such as the luminosity and velocity .",
    "we use the r - band magnitude for the luminosity of galaxies , @xmath57 , which is defined to be @xmath58 , that is , the absolute magnitude @xmath59 when @xmath60 .",
    "we show in the top panel of figure [ fig : pdfmh ] the probability distribution of the virial mass @xmath61 of our simulation dark matter halos .",
    "@xmath43 has more massive halos than @xmath42 , thus @xmath43 can be used to investigate the distribution of more luminous galaxies while @xmath42 for ordinary galaxies with moderate luminosity .",
    "the sharp cut for each @xmath46 represents the minimum mass of the dark matter halos that consist of at least @xmath62 particles in our definition .",
    "the host halo mass distributions of the central and satellite galaxies in the galaxy catalog of @xcite are also shown in the middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : pdfmh ] , respectively .",
    "we divide the galaxy samples into subsamples of different luminosity , and the probability distribution of host halo masses are shown as the different lines in the figure .",
    "to avoid incompleteness , the available galaxy sub - samples are actually limited for each @xmath46 simulation .",
    "as it is shown in figure [ fig : pdfmh ] , we can use all those galaxies with @xmath63 for @xmath42 ( however , the most luminous galaxies with @xmath4 are not abundant in @xmath42 , which will cause large fluctuations in their bispectrum statistics .",
    "that is why we do not consider this luminosity subsample for @xmath42 ) . for @xmath43 , because dark matter halos have high mass of @xmath64 , only those galaxies of @xmath65 will be analyzed .",
    "to obtain the galaxy bias factors by fitting equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) , one needs an accurate error estimation for the galaxy bispectrum @xmath21 . since we do not have enough independent fourier space k modes on large scales of @xmath48 ( finite - volume effect ) , and the number of realizations for each @xmath46 simulation",
    "are also limited , the large fluctuations among different realizations on large scales would prevent us from making an accurate error estimation of @xmath21 .",
    "so we use the gaussian uncertainties , instead of the simulation fluctuations , as the errors for @xmath21 .",
    "the uncertainty of bispectrum for a gaussian density field reads ( e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the number of independent triangle configuration modes in the fourier space , and @xmath68 includes the shot noise in the galaxy power spectrum for the case of @xmath69 objects .",
    "although we measure @xmath67 directly from the simulations , it can be estimated theoretically as @xcite    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 for equilateral , isosceles and general triangles . by assuming that the variance of bispectrum dominates over that of the power spectrum , variance of the reduced bispectrum",
    "is then given by ,    @xmath73 ^ 2}. \\label{eqn : gerr}\\ ] ]    the fluctuation of @xmath21 is thus directly determined by the number of independent triangle modes , @xmath67 , which are actually related to the simulation box size , @xmath46 .",
    "the larger box simulation has higher precision in the determination of bispectrum on large scales , especially for @xmath48 .",
    "in addition to the considerable fluctuations , the finite - volume effect is also significant for the bispectrum on large scales . because the bispectrum essentially reflects the influence of the gravitational instability , the existence of large - scale structures , such as filaments , will significantly affect the final bispectrum estimation(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "overall , large @xmath46 simulations are essential if we want to determine the bispectrum on such large scales with unerring accuracy , as we have processed in this paper .",
    "figure [ fig : sigrg ] shows the ratios between the errors on the mean of @xmath74 averaged over the realizations and the corresponding uncertainties based on the gaussian assumption .",
    "the ratios for galaxies of different luminosity ( symbols ) are compared with those ratios for dark matter ( solid lines ) for both @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "given that triangles with a side in common will correlate with each other , we alleviate this problem by defining the scale @xmath7 in figure [ fig : sigrg ] to be the longest side of the triangle and by including all the triangle configurations in each @xmath7 bin .",
    "the remaining correlations are ignored .",
    "so , each data point in figure 2 represents the mean of all the triangle configurations whose longest sides are in the same k bin , and the @xmath75 error shown is the fluctuation among the different triangle configurations .",
    "the small discrepancies of dark matter ratios between @xmath43 and @xmath42 are caused by the different simulation resolutions , with @xmath43 more reliable on large scales and @xmath42 on small scales .",
    "as for galaxies of @xmath76 , the reduced bispectrum errors can be well described by the gaussian errors on large scales of @xmath48 .",
    "the galaxies have similar error ratios to those of dark matter , implying that the deviation of the bispectrum error from the gaussian field error is slim in the linear clustering regime . for the galaxy samples of @xmath4 ,",
    "the simulation variances deviate rapidly from the gaussian uncertainties even on large scales .",
    "this is because these galaxies are highly biased , and the non - gaussianity already plays an important role in determining @xmath77 for such luminous galaxies .",
    "since we are interested in the behavior of the bias factors at @xmath78 , we will use equation ( [ eqn : gerr ] ) to estimate the errors for the galaxy reduced bispectrum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : b112 ] ( @xmath43 ) and figure [ fig : b16 ] ( @xmath42 ) , we show the @xmath79 fitting results of equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) for the linear bias factor @xmath11 .",
    "the left panels show the fitting results with @xmath22 measured from simulations , and the middle panels show the results with @xmath22 determined by pt2 . as in observations",
    ", we also use the nonlinear power spectrum @xmath80 in equations ( [ eqn : qbp ] ) and ( [ eqn : bk ] ) for the pt2 estimation of @xmath22 , and the results are shown in the right panels .",
    "the solid lines denote the predictions derived from the power spectrum ratios as in equation ( [ eqn : b1p ] ) .",
    "again , the scale @xmath7 in the figures is defined as the maximum triangle size of ( @xmath16 ) . and",
    "for each @xmath7 bin , we have included all types of triangle shapes to make the fittings .",
    "the jump in the errors of @xmath42 at @xmath81 is caused by our change of fourier space bin scheme at this scale .    in the left panels , the bias factor @xmath11 determined by equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) is well consistent with that of the power spectrum ratio ( equation([eqn : b1p ] ) ) on large scales of @xmath82 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath11 can be reconstructed from bispectrum observations of galaxies without significant systematic bias .",
    "however , when @xmath22 is calculated from pt2 ( the middle panels ) , the fitted @xmath11 are overestimated on most scales except for the largest one of @xmath83 where the fluctuation is dramatic .",
    "the main reason is that pt2 overestimates @xmath22 for colinear configurations ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) and underestimates for triangles of @xmath86 even on large scales of @xmath87 @xcite . using the nonlinear power spectrum for the pt2 prediction of @xmath22 does not improve the fitting results , as shown by the right panels .",
    "our results clearly show that it is necessary to have an accurate estimation of the dark matter bispectrum if equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) is used to get the galaxy bias factors .",
    "when the scale goes down to @xmath88 , the nonlinear effects become important .",
    "the linear bias @xmath11 does not keep a constant on these small scales .",
    "then the premise of the fittings that @xmath2 and @xmath3 both are scale - invariant in equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) breaks down .",
    "we would expect that these bias factors from the power spectrum ratios and from the bispectrum fittings will be different , though we note that they agree well on scales down to @xmath89 for galaxy samples of @xmath90 , which could be a coincidence . as pt2 breaks down for the prediction of dark matter bispectrum even on scales slightly larger than that of @xmath1 ,",
    "our results show the expansion of the galaxy density fields in equation ( [ eqn : taylor ] ) is valid on the smaller scales ( @xmath91 ) .    to verify the conclusions above",
    ", we also show the scale dependence of @xmath92 in figure [ fig : b212 ] ( @xmath43 ) and figure [ fig : b26 ] ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath92 is nearly a constant on large scales of @xmath82 . with the scale independence of @xmath2 on these scales",
    ", we infer that the nonlinear bias @xmath3 is also scale invariant for small @xmath7 .",
    "it again confirms the feasibility of deriving @xmath2 and @xmath3 from equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) through direct @xmath79 fittings .",
    "but @xmath3 deviates from such constancy as the scale goes to the nonlinear scales , similar to the case of the linear bias @xmath2 . in general",
    ", the nonlinear bias @xmath3 is nonvanishing on large scales and plays an important role in the determination of the linear bias factor @xmath2 when using equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the most luminous samples have positive values of @xmath3 ( @xmath93 for @xmath4 and @xmath94 @xmath95 ) on large scales , but fainter samples have negative values of @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 ) .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath92 for galaxy samples with @xmath100 are nearly the same with @xmath101 at @xmath48 , which might be a coincidence for this particular semi - analytical model of galaxy formation .",
    "the general behavior that @xmath3 increases with the luminosity at the high luminosity end , and decreases with increasing luminosity at fainter luminosity , is consistent with the change of nonlinear halo bias @xmath102 with the dark matter halo mass @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the middle and right panels of figure [ fig : b212 ] and figure [ fig : b26 ] clearly demonstrate the failure of the fittings for the bias factors when using pt2 to calculate @xmath22 .",
    "( since the error bars are much too large for @xmath103 , we do not show those data points here . )",
    "thus pt2 is actually not a good estimator for the reduced dark matter bispectrum @xmath22 when we want to use it to fit the bias factors with equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) .",
    "@xcite used pt2 as the preferred choice for the estimation of @xmath22 and they determine the bias factors for @xmath104 . as we showed above , on these scales ,",
    "the pt2 is not accurate enough(see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the fitting results of the bias factors are biased even if the measurement of @xmath21 from galaxy surveys is accurate .",
    "since the pt2 as well as the taylor expansion breaks down quickly on quasilinear scales ( @xmath50 ) , we want to explore if the halo occupation distribution(hod ) model of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can extend the theoretical modeling to quasilinear and even nonlinear scales .",
    "the hod model has been used to predict the bispectrum of galaxies in numerical simulations @xcite and in analytical modeling @xcite . in this section , we check if the bispectra of galaxies on quasilinear scales can be modeled with the latter method .",
    "the necessary halo model ingredients are described as follows .",
    "the dark matter halos are defined as objects with a mean density @xmath105 times that of the background universe@xcite where @xmath106 for our cosmology parameters , and their density distributions follow the navarro ",

    "therefore , the framework of the halo model , including its important ingredients , needs to be further digested in future studies .",
    "we use a set of numerical @xmath0-body simulations to study the large scale behavior of the galaxy bias parameters with the bispectrum method . we first determine the dark matter distribution from our simulations and then construct our mock galaxy catalogs from the semi - analytical model of @xcite .",
    "the galaxy bias parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be simply obtained by fitting the relation of equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) given the knowledge of the dark matter and galaxy bispectra .",
    "we find that on large scales down to @xmath143 , the bias factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nearly constant .",
    "more importantly , @xmath2 obtained from the bispectrum method is consistent with that from the power spectrum ratio ( equation ( [ eqn : b1p ] ) ) , indicating that the linear bias factor @xmath2 can be obtained from the distribution of galaxies .",
    "also in general , the nonlinear bias @xmath3 is not zero ; it is of a negative value for galaxies of typical luminosity , and increases to a positive value for the most luminous galaxies . on scales of @xmath88 ,",
    "the bias factors rapidly deviate from the constancy shown on large scales .",
    "this is because the nonlinear effects become important on these quasilinear and nonlinear regimes . on these scales , the simple relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) or the assumption that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constant is not valid .",
    "it is therefore not effective to use this relation to obtain the bias factors on small scales .",
    "we also try pt2 to estimate the dark matter bispectrum in the bias equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) .",
    "but the poor agreement with the known linear bias factor shows that it is very important to accurately estimate the dark matter bispectrum when using equation ( [ eqn : bfit ] ) .",
    "this indicates that pt2 is still not accurate enough for the dark matter bispectrum estimation even on fairly large scales .",
    "thus , it again implies that higher - order corrections , such as the one - loop correction@xcite in the perturbation theory , are necessary for more precise estimation of the bispectrum in the further studies .",
    "because of the simple structure of the halo model method , we also incorporate hod from our mock galaxy catalogs to model the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum , as shown in figure [ fig : png ] and figure [ fig : qg ] .",
    "overall , the analytical halo models are not accurate enough to describe the power spectrum and bispectrum of galaxies on the requirement of current precision studies .",
    "more work is needed to improve the analytical halo model .",
