    "we set @xmath19 if @xmath20 are not on the boundary . for simplicity",
    "sometimes we only write @xmath21 .",
    "then we define a projection operator @xmath22 as follows ( see figure 1 ) : @xmath23 note at @xmath24 in the interior , @xmath22 is an identity map on @xmath25 .",

    "our results of part one are mainly motivated by the previous work by carrillo , slepcev and wu @xcite , where they show the well - posedness of equation in stationary , non - convex domains with compactly supported initial data .",

    "this result is significant since it provides a natural justification for the first - order system .",
    "let us outline the proof for the well - posedness of with compactly supported initial data and illustrate the difficulties involving time - dependent domains .",
    "as in @xcite , we use particle approximations . take a sequence @xmath31 which converges to @xmath28 in 2-wasserstein metric ( see preliminaries [ 1.1 ] or readers can refer to @xcite ) where @xmath32 is a sum of dirac masses .",

    "the novelty in this paper is that , for space - time domains an extra term ( the last term in ) appears in the  curve of maximal slope \" : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "intuitively @xmath41 comes from the moving boundary constraints and the possible situation that particles attempt to move out of the domain with potential velocity @xmath42 but end up moving with the boundary with velocity @xmath43 . according to the definition of @xmath22 , it is not hard to see that @xmath41 is only nontrivial if @xmath4 is singular with mass concentrating on the boundary .",
    "alternatively if the domain is stationary , this term vanishes , since if the boundary speed @xmath44 , @xmath45 is to the normal direction while @xmath46 is tangential .",
    "this additional term requires careful analysis when dealing with the limit as @xmath47 : see the proof of theorem [ thmu ] , where we study the integral on the boundary of positive speed and negative speed separately .",

    "the scheme is slightly different from the standard version that we minimize each movement among probability measures with support contained in @xmath0 ( see ) . to obtain the continuum time limit of the discrete - time solutions ,",

    "after establishing the well - posedness of weak solutions , we send @xmath30 .",
    "we show that if the domain is bounded and spatially convex , equations are indeed the vanishing viscosity approximation of the first order equation in the first part .",

    "was studied in the case when @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the newtonian potential .",
    "their proof heavily relies on the specific choice of kernel @xmath9 , and also the fact that the domain is @xmath77 which eliminates the task of determining the limiting boundary condition .",
