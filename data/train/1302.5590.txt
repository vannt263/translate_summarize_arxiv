    "the nature of the neutrino , dirac or majorana , is still an open question today .",
    "this notwithstanding , these are not the only options . for example , neutrinos may be pseudo - dirac ( pd )  @xcite or quasi - dirac ( qd )  @xcite .",
    "the former pd neutrinos arise when two active majorana neutrinos are mass degenerate . in the qd neutrinos case",
    "the mass degeneration occurs with an active and a sterile neutrino  @xcite .",
    "this sort of neutrinos is called sterile because they do not couple to the @xmath10 and neither to the @xmath11 .",
    "they only couple , in the context of the known physics , to gravity . in both cases",
    "the two majorana mass degenerate neutrinos are equivalent to a dirac one .",
    "the qd neutrino also may be generated if the majorana mass term of the sterile neutrinos is smaller than the dirac mass term . in both cases ,",
    "pd and qd neutrinos , corrections at the tree level or at the loop level will break the mass degeneracy .",
    "generally , in models in which one of these options are implemented they are applied to all neutrinos . for instance , all the three active neutrinos are dirac , majorana , pd or qd particles .",
    "an interesting qd situation happens when only one of the active neutrinos together with a sterile one are mass degenerated at tree level . in this case the three flavor states are , also at tree level , a linear combination of two massive majorana neutrinos and the left component of a dirac neutrino .",
    "this possibility naturally arises when @xmath12 symmetry is implemented in the neutrino yukawa interactions  @xcite . in the qd scheme of refs .",
    "@xcite the pmns matrix is , at tree level , the tribimaximal ( tbm )  @xcite and the scheme is not in agreement with the recent result of a non - zero @xmath13 angle  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can ask ourselves if in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite quantum corrections may induce an appropriate value for that mixing angle . at tree level",
    "this is possible if the @xmath12 symmetry is not implemented in the charged lepton yukawa interactions and an appropriate value for @xmath13 is obtained  @xcite . however ,",
    "quantum corrections imply , in principle , a departure from the tbm that breaks the mass degeneracy and the pmns matrix becomes a @xmath14 matrix .",
    "this implies oscillations of active neutrinos into the sterile one and , for this reason , it is mandatory to analyze how the solar neutrino data constrain the quantum corrections .",
    "the case of a qd with small majorana masses for the sterile neutrinos was considered in ref .",
    "however , those authors analyzed in detail only qd @xmath8 and @xmath9 schemes .",
    "it is not obvious if a qd @xmath0 scheme  @xcite , as the present one , satisfies the same constraint as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    we know at present more about the parameters of neutrino oscillations and such knowledge is crucial for us to restructure the standard model . for a recent statistical analysis of all experimental neutrino data available see  @xcite",
    ". moreover , since the lep data , we know that there are only three active neutrinos  @xcite . thus , an extra neutrino has to be sterile in the sense explained above .",
    "once sterile neutrinos are added they can be of several types depending on the mass scale related with them . for a recent review of this sort of neutrinos see refs .",
    "@xcite . they may be or not related to some anomalies  @xcite in neutrino data  @xcite or with the results of wmap-7  @xcite , which indicates the existence of four relativistic species ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "we will apply the available solar neutrino data in a more realistic qd @xmath0 case , considering the possibility of electronic neutrinos ( @xmath16 ) oscillating to sterile neutrinos ( @xmath17 ) . for the statistical analysis",
    ", our model has two parameters : one mass eigenstate ( @xmath3 ) and the radiative correction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is an important difference if we compare our analysis with the one made by de gouva _ et al . _ in section ( iii.a 2 + 1 case )  @xcite . despite the differences in the model building ,",
    "we have obtained an allowed region for @xmath2 that is similar to the corresponding values found in  @xcite , which is @xmath18 .",
    "we stress the fact that the mass splitting of the would - be dirac neutrinos do not solve the experimental anomalies presented in  @xcite , however it is consistent with wmap-7 results  @xcite , since the calculated fourth mass eigenstate , @xmath6 , varies in the interval 0.01 - 0.2  ev , at 2@xmath7 level .",

    "[ sec : final ] .",
    "recently it was shown that it is possible that all neutrino flavors are part dirac and part majorana  @xcite .",
    "the latter occurs because two of the four majorana neutrinos are mass degenerate and have opposite parity , so they are equivalent to one dirac neutrino . as we said before , when these two neutrinos form a dirac state and they are active , we call them pseudo - dirac neutrinos . when there is one active and one sterile , they are called quasi - dirac neutrinos . the other two have distinct majorana masses . in our particular model , we point out that there are initially three right - handed neutrinos",
    ". two of them are integrated and we obtain a model qd `` @xmath0 '' - three active neutrinos and one sterile .    in this section",

    "[ subsec : qcorrections ] , we show the main interactions that are going to be used to obtain the radiative corrections for the neutrino masses .",
    "these radiative corrections are very important to our analysis : we study their effects on the break of the degeneracy between the two majorana neutrinos that form a dirac neutrino at tree level . for more details of the model building that we have used here ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the model we are going to present here is based on a gauged @xmath20 symmetry with a quasi - dirac neutrino in which the right - handed neutrinos carry exotic local @xmath20 charges  @xcite .    when the @xmath12 symmetry is added to the model ,",
    "the left - handed leptons belong to the reducible triplet representation ( @xmath21 ) since all of them have the same @xmath20 charge .",
    "however , unlike the usual case when the three right - handed neutrinos have @xmath22 , in this model they have different @xmath20 charge , so they can transform under @xmath12 only as a singlet @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and a doublet , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "in the neutrino yukawa sector , the @xmath12 triplet , @xmath27 , can be decomposed into irreducible representations as @xmath28 , then we can write the singlet and doublet as follows : @xmath29    the scalar sector has two scalar doublets of @xmath30 with weak hypercharge @xmath31 that are denoted by @xmath32 .",

    "the mass matrix is diagonalized by the following @xmath14 matrix : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the tribimaximal matrix and @xmath46 denote the matrix row or column with entries equal to zero .",
