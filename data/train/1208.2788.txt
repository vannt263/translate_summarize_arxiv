    "in view of missing ( to date ) new physics signals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is of utmost importance to exploit precision calculations together with precise experimental results in order to look for deviations from the standard model ( sm ) . in this context",
    ", the rare decay @xmath2 constitutes one of the most important processes .",
    "it is a loop - generated flavour - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transition , which makes it very sensitive to contributions from beyond - sm particles .",
    "moreover , its branching ratio can be measured with an uncertainty of a few percent and , at the same time , the result can be predicted within perturbation theory with a similar uncertainty .",
    "the current average of the measurements by cleo  @xcite , belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite reads  @xcite @xmath5 it includes the recently updated babar data analysis  @xcite .",
    "the measurements have been performed with various photon energy cutoffs @xmath6 ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8gev .",
    "their average in eq .",
    "( [ exp.aver ] ) involves an extrapolation to @xmath9gev .",
    "it can be confronted with the sm prediction based on the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd calculations which reads @xmath10  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider extensions of the sm higgs sector by a second higgs doublet , namely the so - called two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) .",
    "they are constructed in such a way that no fcnc occur at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "such models have five physical scalar degrees of freedom , among which there is a charged higgs boson @xmath11 that plays an important role for @xmath12 .",
    "we shall consider two versions of the model , usually denoted by 2hdm type - i and type - ii where , respectively , either the same or two different higgs doublet fields couple to the up- and down - type quarks . in these models , both higgs doublets acquire vacuum expectation values @xmath13 such that @xmath14gev determines the @xmath15 and @xmath16 boson masses in the same way as in the sm .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "comparison of the experimental results for @xmath19 to predictions within the 2hdm type - ii leads to the strongest constraint on the charged higgs boson mass for @xmath20 $ ] ( see , e.g. , sec .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ; the precise range depends on the treatment of uncertainties ) .",
    "so far , the constraint has been derived using only the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) expressions for the 2hdm contributions at the electroweak scale , while the sm contributions were treated at the nnlo  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we compute the missing two- and three - loop nnlo matching coefficients in the 2hdm , and re - do the analysis to extract a lower bound on @xmath21 from the new experimental average ( [ exp.aver ] ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we discuss the matching coefficients up to the three - loop order .",
    "besides considering the 2hdm , we also re - compute the sm matching contribution , and improve the three - loop results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section  [ sec::br2hdm ]",
    ", we use the new results to evaluate @xmath19 to the nnlo accuracy , and to extract a lower bound on @xmath21 .",
    "section  [ sec::conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the formalism to compute the wilson coefficients in the 2hdm can be taken over from the sm case  @xcite .",
    "we shall follow the regularization and renormalization conventions of those papers .",
    "in particular , we adopt the effective lagrangian and the definition of the operators @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) from eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) and  ( 2.2 ) of ref .",
    "one should note that the dipole operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 are normalized there with inverse powers of the qcd coupling constant .    since the additional degrees of freedom of the 2hdm are all heavy , they only influence the wilson coefficients @xmath26 of the operators @xmath27 . in order to incorporate the 2hdm contribution in a manner that is analogous to the sm analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , we split the wilson coefficients as @xmath28 where @xmath29 marks contributions from loop diagrams with virtual charm and top quarks , respectively .",
    "our matching calculation is performed at the renormalization scale @xmath4 .",
    "it is chosen to be of the same order of magnitude as masses of the particles that are being decoupled ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "for the nlo calculations within the sm we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . the nnlo sm contributions to @xmath32 have been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . suppression by @xmath33 makes @xmath34 negligible . in the following",
    ", we shall consider @xmath35 only .",
    "it is convenient to decompose them as follows @xmath36 where @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath38-loop diagrams . for @xmath39 , the tree - level coefficients @xmath40",
    "vanish , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 have been found in refs .  @xcite . in the present paper , we compute the three - loop corrections @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which constitutes the last missing element of the 2hdm wilson coefficient evaluation that matters for @xmath45 at the nnlo .",
    "furthermore , we reproduce the two - loop corrections @xmath42 for @xmath46 that have been originally found in ref .  @xcite and belong to the necessary nnlo matching in the 2hdm .    in the following two subsections ,",
    "we discuss our results for the wilson coefficients in the sm and 2hdm .",
    "several variables turn out to be of convenience in this context : @xmath47      let us begin with recalling three - loop corrections to the matching coefficients in the sm .",
    "they depend on two masses : @xmath31 and @xmath30 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , expansions of the three - loop diagrams for @xmath48 and @xmath49 have been performed .",
    "the final numerical results of that paper @xmath50 have been obtained for @xmath51 .",
    "they relied on convergence behaviour and agreement of the two expansions for intermediate values of @xmath31 and @xmath30 .    the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig::c7c8sm ] show expansions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 around @xmath54 up to @xmath55 .",
    "results of the expansion around @xmath56 are shown as dashed and solid lines .",
    "the thick dashed lines include terms up to @xmath57 that have been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present calculation , we have added eight more expansion terms for @xmath49 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::c7c8sm ] as thin dashed lines and a solid curve that includes terms up to @xmath58 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let us now shortly discuss the 2hdm of type - i . in fig .",
    "[ fig::type1](a ) , we show the branching ratio for @xmath59 as a function of @xmath21 , including the uncertainties .",
    "the meaning of the curves is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig::type2](b ) .",
    "contrary to the type - ii model , the branching ratio gets suppressed with respect to the sm , and the effect becomes larger for lower values of @xmath21 , which implies increased discrepancy with respect to the experimental results .",
    "thus , it is possible to set a lower bound on @xmath21 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::type1](b ) where the shaded area represents the part of the @xmath18-@xmath21 plane that is excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "similar results based on the partial nnlo predictions and the previous experimental average have been presented in ref .",
    "applying the method of expansion in mass ratios , we have evaluated three - loop matching conditions for the dipole operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the 2hdm . in effect , wilson coefficients of all the operators that matter for @xmath2 in this model at the leading order in electroweak interactions are now known to the nnlo accuracy in qcd .",
    "this is true not only at the matching scale @xmath4 but also at the low - energy scale @xmath60 because the renormalization group evolution is the same as in the sm  @xcite .    the main effect of including the nnlo matching is a significant reduction of @xmath4-dependence of the charged higgs contribution to the @xmath12 branching ratio .",
    "it is particularly transparent when considering a lower bound on @xmath21 in the type - ii model . before taking our correction into account ,",
    "the bound varies by around @xmath61  gev when @xmath4 is varied in a reasonable range @xmath62\\,{\\rm gev } \\sim [ \\frac12 m_t,{m_{h^+}}]$ ] . including the correction reduces the variation by more than a factor of 3 .    with the updated experimental average , we find that the 95%  c.l .",
    "( 99%  c.l . )",
    "lower limit on @xmath21 amounts to 380  ( 289 )  gev in the 2hdm type - ii .",
    "this is a universal ( @xmath18-independent ) bound that can only get stronger when @xmath18-dependence is taken into account . in practice ,",
    "noticeable modifications occur for @xmath18 smaller than around 2 .    in the 2hdm type - i , a 95%  c.l .",
    "lower limit on @xmath21 from @xmath63 can be derived for low @xmath18 only , currently for @xmath64 when @xmath21 is above the lep bound of around @xmath65gev  @xcite . in this case , considerable reduction of @xmath4-dependence is observed , too .    with the semi - analytical results presented in this paper , constraints on the 2hdm at the nnlo level",
    "can easily be updated in the future , along with developments in the measurements and in calculations of the low - energy matrix elements ( that are identical in the sm and in the 2hdm ) .",
    "more precise measurements are expected in a few years from belle - ii  @xcite and super - b  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the main challenges are improvements in analyses of non - perturbative effects  @xcite together with perturbative calculations of the nnlo on - shell amplitudes beyond the large-@xmath66 limit . in the latter case",
    ", new results should become available soon  @xcite .",
