    "nowadays , people of various professions use different cad systems .",
    "there are many ways to represent curves and surfaces , therefore , the exchange of geometric data between those systems often requires approximate conversion .",
    "as it was stated in  @xcite , there are two main operations that should be considered : degree reduction and merging . in the past @xmath1 years , both problems have been extensively investigated . in this paper , we focus on the constrained merging of segments of a composite bzier curve , i.e. , we look for a single bzier curve that approximates multiple adjacent bzier curves and satisfies certain conditions .",
    "we propose the so - called _ box constraints _ , which appear for the first time in the context of the merging problem .",
    "a conventional problem of merging is to approximate multiple adjacent bzier curves with a single bzier curve which minimizes a selected error function and satisfies some continuity constraints at the endpoints .",
    "most of the papers deal with merging of only two bzier curves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , to merge more than two curves , one could use those algorithms repeatedly .",
    "however , such an approach increases the error of the approximation as well as the computational cost ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "there are three methods that specialize in merging of more than two bzier curves at the same time ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of how many curves are merged , the most frequently used strategy is to solve a system of normal equations ( see ,  e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in  @xcite",
    ", one can observe a different approach which is based on the properties of the so - called constrained dual bernstein basis polynomials ( to our knowledge , this method is the fastest one available ) .",
    "the parametric ( see ,  e.g. ,  @xcite ) or geometric ( see ,  e.g. ,  @xcite ) continuity at the endpoints is preserved .    in  @xcite",
    ", one of us proposed a new approach to the problem of degree reduction of bzier curves .",
    "the author noticed that as a result of the conventional degree reduction , the computed control points can be located far away from the plot of the curve .",
    "he also explained why this is a serious defect .",
    "next , to eliminate this issue , he solved the degree reduction problem with constraints of a new type . in this paper , we show that the same observations may apply to the control points of the merged curve .",
    "therefore , the main goal of this paper is to formulate a new problem of merging of bzier curves . as in  @xcite",
    ", the new approach requires completely different methods than in the case of the conventional one .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "further on in this section , we give necessary definitions and notation . in section  [ sec : pre ] , we formulate the problem of merging of bzier curves with box constraints .",

    "as it turns out , the observations on the degree reduction problem ( see  @xcite ) also apply to the merging problem . in order to see the issue clearly ,",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "[ ex:1 ] we give the planar composite bzier curve `` ampersand '' , with three fifth degree bzier segments ( see figure  [ figure1a ] ) , defined by the control points @xmath50",

    "figure  [ figure1b ] shows the original composite curve and the merged curve .",
    "clearly , the result of the approximation is very accurate .",
    "the errors are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 with @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "observe also that the original control points are quite close to the plot of the curve ( see figure  [ figure1a ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the resulting control points are located far away from the plot of the curve ( see figure  [ figure1c ] ) . note that we are unable to see the curve and its control points in one figure . because of the non - intuitive location of the control points , further modeling of the merged curve is hard to imagine . a  designer that modifies the control points uses a convex hull property , which gives an intuition on shape and location of the curve . as it was stated in  @xcite ,",
    "the size of the convex hull is a  measure of _ predictability _ of the curve .",
    "furthermore , let us recall that a small convex hull can be helpful while checking that two curves do not intersect , a curve and a surface do not intersect , a point does not lie on a curve .",
    "observe that the convex hull of the resulting curve is huge , therefore , completely useless .",
    "comparing this result with the ones from  @xcite , we see that the defect seems to be even more significant ( cf .",
    "* figures 1b , 4b and 5b ) ) .",
    "now , let us impose some box constraints .",
    "we want the searched control points to be inside the specified rectangular area ( including edges of the rectangle ) .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] presents the solution of problem  [ p : problem ] for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",

    "first , we notice that some observations concerning the box - constrained degree reduction are also true in the case of the box - constrained merging .",
    "clearly , a bzier curve being the solution of problem  [ p : problem ] can be obtained in a componentwise way ( cf .",
    "* remark  3.3 ) ) .    therefore , it is sufficient to describe our method in the case of @xmath84 .",

    "one can see clearly that @xmath90 is a quadratic function .",
    "therefore , in the following subsection , we are dealing with the so - called _ box - constrained quadratic programming problem_.      in this subsection , we use the quadratic programming approach to solve problem  [ p : problem ] .",
    "quadratic programming is an _ optimization problem _ of minimizing or maximizing a quadratic _ objective function _ of several variables subject to linear constraints on these variables .",

    "for that reason , the examples given in this paper are much more demanding than the ones presented in  @xcite .",

    "these positive attributes make the new problem worth of consideration , despite the inevitably longer running times and the larger approximation errors , which are also unavoidable .",
