    "recurrence plot ( rp ) was initially introduced by eckman _ et al_. ( 1987 ) @xcite as a tool for analyzing experimental time series data , especially useful for finding hidden correlations in highly complicated data and determine the stationarity of the time series .",
    "this method allows the identification of system properties that can not be observed by the linear and nonlinear usual approaches it is worth to mention the simplicity of the algorithms during numerical calculations too .",
    "a rp is an injective application of a single reconstructed trajectory to the boolean matrix space , each pair @xmath0 , @xmath1 coming from the time series is related with a pair @xmath2 , called recurrence points .",
    "let us consider @xmath3 values of a time series given by    @xmath4    with @xmath3 large enough in order to evaluate the embedding dimension by using the false nearest neighborhood @xcite ( @xmath5 ) and the time delay ( @xmath6 ) by looking at the relative minimum in the mutual information @xcite following takens embedding theorem @xcite , the dynamics can be appropriately represented by the phase space trajectory reconstructed by using the time delay vectors    @xmath7    and the recurrence matrix is :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the heaviside function and the matrix is symmetric .",
    "that means a rp is built by comparing all delayed vectors with each other .",
    "a dark dot is plotted , ( @xmath10 ) with integer coordinates @xmath2 when @xmath11 , otherwise a white dot is plotted ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the interval @xmath13 $ ] it is known as _ threshold corridor_. the choice of this interval is critical , too large produces a saturation of the rp including irrelevant points , and too narrow losses information . since up to now in the literature there are not a satisfactory solution , an educated guess should be appropriate . in this work we used",
    "@xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the standard deviation .",
    "et al_. @xcite in order to characterize and analyze recurrent plots introduced a set of quantifiers , which are collectively called _ recurrence quantified analysis _ ( rqa ) .",
    "the first of this quantifiers is the _ % recurrence _ ( % rec ) , defined as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 ( every possible points ) and @xmath18 is _ number of recursive points _ given by :    @xmath19    the slope of the linear region in the s - shaped % rec vs. corridor width is the correlation dimension . the second rqa quantifier is called _",
    "% determinism _",
    "( % det ) ; and it is defined as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is called the _ number of periodic dots _ given by :    @xmath22    and a periodic line with length @xmath23 , origin @xmath24 and zone @xmath25 is defined as :    @xmath26    the % det is related with the organization of the rp .",
    "the third rqa quantifier , called _ entropy _ ( s ) , is closely related to % det .",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 is the length of the maximum periodic line , @xmath29 is the relative frequency of the periodic lines with length @xmath30 .",
    "the label entropy is just that , a label , not to be confused with shannon s entropy since there is not a one to one correspondence between this quantifier and the shannon s entropy .",
    "this quantity should be labeled more properly as _ first rate cumulant _ since is related with the relative frequency fluctuations . moreover , for periodic orbits they are mapped onto diagonals with different lengths and uniformly distributed , giving values of @xmath31 , with a maximum value .",
    "[ t:1 ] webber assumes that @xmath32 is related with shannon s entropy if and only if the system is chaotic and the embedding dimension large enough .",
    "the fourth quantifier is the longest periodic line found during the computation of % det given by @xmath33 .",
    "et al_. claim that line lengths on rp are directly related to inverse of the largest positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "short lines values are therefore indicative of chaotic or stochastic behavior .",
    "the peroxidas - oxidase ( po ) reaction is an important bridge between the chemical excitable oscillators beluzov zabotinsky reaction and biological oscillators such as intracellular @xmath34 oscillators @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that po reactions shows a wide spectrum of interesting behaviors including simple oscillations , bistability , quasiperiodicity and chaos @xcite .",
    "these behavior have all been observed _ in vitro _ under well controlled laboratory conditions .",
    "this reaction appears in plants as part of the process of lignifications @xcite with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nadh ) as electron donor .",
    "its estequeometric formulae is :    @xmath35    in 1983 , a model of po reaction , now commonly referred to the * olsen s model * @xcite , was proposed .",
    "simulations with the olsen model quantitatively reproduce both the simple and chaotic oscillations of po reactions . studies with this model showed that increasing the parameter @xmath36 caused the system to undergo a transition from simple oscillations to chaos via a cascade of periodic doubling bifurcations .",
    "the olsen s model involves four variable , molecular oxygen * a * , nadh * b * and two intermediate species .",
    "one of the intermediates is very likely @xmath37 * x * , while other is oxyferrous peroxidase * y * , also know as _ compound iii_. the complete mechanism corresponds system of four differential equations are given below :    @xmath38    we use @xmath36 as control parameter which induces a transition to chaos type i @xcite .",
    "if we wisht to use the rqa method to a time series long enough for reliability , we face with the usual difficulties , memory capacity and calculus complexity .",
    "most of the codes were developed in c under linux operating system .",
    "this language does not implement the boolean data type using integer type instead , so the required memory amount to store the recurrence matrix coming from a typical time series of @xmath39 data points is 128 gbits and , the algorithm complexity is quadratic , which implies huge time consuming . in order to solve these problems we propose to reduce the dimension of the matrix @xmath40 , but then the mapping may not be one to one and a whole region of the reconstructed space would have the same points as an image . therefore @xmath40 as defined in ( [ eq:1 ] ) is modified as : @xmath41 if and only if at least a pair of indexes exists    @xmath42 , \\ ,   l=[j \\frac{n}{m } ] \\}\\ ] ]    for @xmath24 y @xmath43 given , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the amount data points , such as    @xmath46    and zero otherwise .",
    "due to hardware limitation we use recurrence matrices 10240 x 10240 values , although this fact was discussed before , and means a loss in the matrix resolution , the obtained results are quite satisfactory taking into account an adjusting of the corridor width and studying the parameters asymptotic behavior as a function of the number of the data .",
    "another problem concers the rqa high sensibility with the number of cycles during a time interval .",
    "as is depicted in figure-[fig:1 ] % det has an asymptotic value when the number of cycles is greater than 30 . if we are dealing with a sub - harmonic cascade or in the intermittency region an abrupt change in the number of cycles",
    "is observed , giving us false transitions associate to the change in the cycles number .",
    "but the number of cycles can not be so big because produces a graphics saturation then % det falls on minor values .",
    "a reason is an increment in vectors amount mapped to same @xmath47 matrix component .",
    "so when this amount goes too far a heuristic limit ; determinism is lost .",
    "taking this into account the parametric measurements associate to the rqa were done in such a way to use the half cycles on the plateau .",
    "since rp is not quite sensible to the election of the embedding dimension , @xmath48 , we use @xmath49 which this value allow us to eliminate the non diagonal points in the rp plots without affecting its general structure @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no difference is observed neither @xmath50 , or any rqa parameters within a range @xmath51 , so we use the value which recommended by takens theorem @xcite . as can be seen in figures-[fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , and [ fig:4 ]",
    "it was no found any direct proportion between @xmath50 , and the maximum lyapunov exponent , @xmath52 , by using the aurell s algorithm _",
    "et al_. in tisean package @xcite calculated with a thieler s window @xcite with 500 time units .",
    "different algorithms associate with the evaluation of @xmath52 were used with unsatisfactory results due to the time consuming for getting a reliable slope in the graphical methods , so we developed our own software that allow us to apply the rqa methods for the calculation of the relevant parameters which characterize in any dynamical system independently of the size of the data .",
    "it is important to note as depicted in figure-[fig:2 ] the chaos transition characterization since @xmath50 increase its value towards a plateau for the @xmath36 values which correspond to a sub - harmonic cascade , as well as a peak in the neighborhood of the first bifurcation value .",
    "% det(@xmath36 ) is associated with the existence of stable and unstable periodic orbits . in general",
    "the probability density related with periodic orbits is uniform , but for a dense family of unstable it orbits has an exponential distribution since it is more probable to find our systems orbits with shorter period . for us , % det@xmath5399% always , see figure-[fig:5 ] , and the behavior in the chaotic region is the same as @xmath50 , that means the increasing number of periodic orbits due to the sub - harmonic cascade from @xmath54 up to reach a maximum in the chaotic region densely populated by unstable orbits . for @xmath55 the number of orbits is considerably reduced after an intermittent behavior .",
    "this is intrinsic to our dynamical system since it is not observed in the lorentz system , used as a toy model @xcitein this trail .",
    "on the other hand , by analyzing % rec(@xmath36 ) we may appreciate the scarce population of recurrent points in the rp .",
    "% rec holds a constant value and is reduced at the beginning of the cascade with a minimum in the chaotic region .",
    "this behavior is different of that observed with % det and @xmath32 augmenting the value up to get a lower plateau .",
    "we assume this can be due to the changes in the shape of the attractor , since the same results is obtained for the lorentz system @xcite .    by a simple inspection in the rp",
    "the increasing number of periodic orbits is clear , because more parallel lines to the diagonal appear , but the changes in the attractor shape are less impressive and only can be appreciate as alabeated curves when the embedding dimension is near @xmath56 .",
    "in spite of webber s assertion we do not observed any difference in the @xmath50 graph neither for high embedding dimension , @xmath57 , nor the lower ones , @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath50 shows a direct proportionality with the maximum lyapunov exponent measured by other methods @xcite . by the observation of the @xmath59 ,",
    "its behavior indicate the chaotic transition because is directly related with the maximum lyapunov exponent besides an afin mapping .",
    "this is in agreement with eckman _",
    "et al_. @xcite statements",
    ". moreover , the algorithms developed and used in this work allow us a systematic rqa analysis efficiently .",
    "we wish to thank the useful comments and discussions with prof . c. webber which allow us to clarify issues regarding the rqa method .",
    "we also acknowledge the `` _ laboratiore de physique des milieux ionises et applications _ '' and we wish to express our gratitude to prof .",
