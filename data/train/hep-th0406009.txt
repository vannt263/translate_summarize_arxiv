    "the calculation of the nll corrections was extended to supersymmetric gauge theories in ref .",

    "it was shown how in a n  =  4 sym theoretical playground the kernel of the bfkl equation is simplified .",
    "in particular , the analyticity of the eigenvalues in terms of the conformal spins allowed the study of the connection between the dglap and bfkl equations in this model , this being possible mainly due to the lack of coupling constant renormalisation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the anomalous dimension matrix of the wilson twist2 operators in this maximally supersymmetric theory in four dimensions was calculated at two loops .",
    "very recently these results were extended to three loops in ref .",
    "@xcite using the calculation for the non  singlet case first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in agreement , in the supersymmetric limit , with the results for the singlet case derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present study , the method for solving the bfkl equation at nll accuracy developed in ref .",
    "@xcite is applied to n  =  4 sym .",
    "this will serve two purposes .",
    "firstly , since the method solves the bfkl equation with full angular information , it can be used to test the results in the literature @xcite for the dependence of the eigenvalues of the kernel on conformal spins .",
    "secondly , due to the conformal invariance of the theory also at higher orders , the analytic solution to the nll bfkl equation is known for n  =  4 sym , and therefore it is possible to directly test the results obtained using the completely independent method described in this work .",
    "the results in the literature for the solution of the n  =  4 sym bfkl equation at nll in terms of conformal eigenfunctions are reviewed in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ transol ] the nll bfkl equation is solved directly in momentum space using the iterative method of ref.@xcite .",
    "[ sec : analys - traj - emiss ] is devoted to a study of the numerical structure of the trajectory and the real emission kernel arising in this approach . in sec .  [",

    "in the bfkl formalism the high energy limit of a scattering process factorizes as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the regge scale .",
    "the energy dependence is determined by the universal process",
    " independent gluon green s function @xmath2 .",
    "the impact factors , @xmath3 , depend on the process under study . in the regge",
    " limit of large centre of mass energy and fixed momentum transfer the effective degrees of freedom are the transverse momenta @xmath4 of the exchanged gluons .",
    "the dynamics of these processes is then two  dimensional evolving with a time variable y. the evolution of the gluon green s function with y is governed by the bfkl equation .",
    "this equation is traditionally written in terms of a mellin transform of y , i.e. @xmath5 with such transformation the equation reads @xmath6 the inhomogeneous term of this integral equation corresponds to a single gluon exchange and the kernel ( in dimensional regularization , @xmath7 ) @xmath8 contains the gluon regge trajectory  @xcite , @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the coupling @xmath10 , which is not running in n  =  4 sym .",
    "the kernel also includes two contributions from the real emissions : @xmath11 where  @xcite @xmath12\\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and  @xcite @xmath13    in n  =  4 sym the bfkl kernel respects conformal symmetry even at nll accuracy , and the eigenfunctions do not change compared to the leading logarithmic ( ll ) ones .",
    "the solution to this equation can therefore be found using the expansion on the known eigenfunctions @xmath14 with @xmath15 the angle defined by the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transverse momenta .",
    "the fourier transform in angles is characterized by the so  called conformal spins @xmath18 .",
    "given that the coupling is fixed it is possible to fully diagonalize the bfkl kernel by simply acting on the ll eigenfunctions , i.e. , in the @xmath19 scheme we have  @xcite @xmath20 in this expression we have defined @xmath21 and @xmath22 \\\\",

    "bremsstrahlung ( gb ) scheme @xmath23 or to the dimensional reduction ( dred ) scheme , which respects susy  @xcite , @xmath24 the results of this work do not change qualitatively .",
    "the analyticity of these expressions , obtained by kotikov and lipatov in  @xcite , for the dependence of the eigenvalues of the nll bfkl kernel on the conformal spins is very important .",
    "it allows the analytic continuation to negative @xmath25 and to find the connection between the bfkl equation and dglap in the n  =  4 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work will be to confirm that these results for the conformal spins are correct using a completely orthogonal method of solution of the bfkl equation , which is developed in the next section .",
    "the starting point of the new method of solution is eq .",

    "( [ xieta ] ) .",
    "the corresponding real emission part will be of the form @xmath38 finally the n=4 sym nll bfkl equation can be expressed as @xmath39 note that the treatment of the kernel is with its full angular dependence , i.e. without angular averaging over the angle between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is therefore possible to extract the contribution to the solution from all conformal spins .",
    "( [ sbfklf ] ) will be solved by iteration , generalising the procedure of ref.@xcite . in order to do so",
    "it is useful to introduce the notation @xmath40 the @xmath41 dependence can go to the denominator of the right hand side of the equation and iterate , generating in this way multiple poles in the complex @xmath41 space , i.e. @xmath42 it is now possible to invert the mellin transform as in eq .",

    "we note that the solution has been expressed as the phase space integral of a product of effective emission vertices connected with no  emission probabilities .    before proceeding further in the numerical study of the solution we present an analysis of the trajectory and real emission kernel in the next section .",
    "in the following we indicate which expressions have been used in the implementation of the solution to the bfkl equation .",
    "firstly , in fig .  [ trajectory ]",
    "it is shown the behaviour of the gluon regge trajectory as in eq .",
    "( [ traj ] ) , @xmath45 , as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ll trajectory always lies below the nll one , for all regularisation schemes .",
    "this is the opposite effect to that found in the qcd case , see ref .",
    "the correction to the trajectory is smallest in the gb scheme , with the dred and @xmath47 being very similar to each other . for the @xmath30 dependence we can see that , at a fixed value of @xmath48 gev , the negative value of the trajectory decreases for lower values of @xmath30 . due to the logarithm",
    ", the trajectory also decreases when , for a fixed @xmath49 gev , @xmath46 increases . for these plots",
    "the coupling was chosen to be @xmath50 for all schemes .",
    "the plots at the right hand side of fig .  [ trajectory ] show the ratio of the nll @xmath45 to its ll value .    secondly , the part of the real emission kernel in eq .",
    "( [ ktilde ] ) , can be written as @xmath51 with @xmath15 being the angle between the two  dimensional vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "for the function @xmath54 we use the expression @xmath55 with @xmath56 as in the qcd case , see ref.@xcite , this kernel has integrable singularities at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this structure is revealed when the kernel is plotted as in fig .",
    "[ kernel ] where @xmath59 is shown for @xmath60 in the @xmath61 scheme .",
    "note how this kernel is positive in a large region of phase space , contrary to the qcd case  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the nll bfkl kernel as in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvaluesf ] ) , @xmath62 , along the line @xmath63 for a value of the coupling of @xmath60 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ kernu ] .",
    "this line parameterises the contour of the @xmath64 integration in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "the ll eigenvalues are compared to those obtained at nll for several values of the conformal spin . at high energies , for @xmath65",
    "the relevant region is the one close to @xmath66 .",
    "the zero conformal spin evolution is governed by the two maxima and is the dominant contribution among all conformal spins .",
    "we will come back to this figure when the evolution with energy of the different contributions to the gluon green s function is studied below .    very importantly , for a regge  like choice of energy scale , the nll kernel in the n = 4 sym theory does not develop an imaginary part along the @xmath67 contour .",
    "this implies that the asymptotic behaviour at large @xmath68 is well controlled and that the gluon green s function is monotonically growing with energy . to illustrate this point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ largey ] the angular averaged gluon green s function up to very large @xmath68 both at ll and nll accuracy .    with the intention to confirm the calculation of the conformal spins in n  =  4 sym of ref .",
    "@xcite the two methods of solution , that in mellin space described in section  [ mellsol ] , and the one proposed in this work directly in transverse momentum space as explained in section  [ transol ] , will be used to calculate the behaviour of the green s function for different conformal spins . to proceed , eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) can be written as @xmath69 and the coefficients in the expansion can be calculated following the solution in mellin space , i.e. @xmath70 or they can be obtained using the solution in @xmath71 space , for this it is needed to project on angles , i.e. @xmath72 therefore the projections on conformal spins can be compared to each other using two completely independent approaches .",
    "the results obtained from both solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ confspinsy ] .",
    "both methods exactly coincide in their predictions .",
    "this confirms the validity of the results calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and it is a very serious test of the method first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the gluon green s function at nll . as expected from fig .",
    "[ kernu ] , the dominant conformal spin is @xmath73 , whose corresponding eigenvalue is the only positive one at @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ kernu ] .",
    "the eigenvalue at @xmath74 for the @xmath75 conformal spin is zero , and thus it is expected to give a constant contribution at large energies .",
    "this behaviour is indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ confspinsy ] . for the rest of conformal spins their contributions to the gluon green s function decrease as the available energy is larger , their eigenvalue being negative at the vecinity of @xmath74 .",
    "a natural question is the convergence in @xmath18 of the angular expansion of eq .",
    "( [ expansion2 ] ) . as",
    "the method of solution proposed in this paper allows for a full determination of the angular dependence it is possible to answer this point in a simple manner .",

    "it can be seen that the conformal expansion reaches good convergence for conformal spins above @xmath76 for the chosen values of @xmath68 .",
    "this plot confirms again that both approaches produce exactly the same results .",
    "the graph is produced for two different energies showing a stronger angular correlation for lower energies ( the curve is flatter in @xmath15 for @xmath77 ) , a consequence of the increasing dominance of the zero conformal spin at larger energies .",
