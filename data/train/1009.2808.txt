    "accretion of matter onto a black hole ( bh ) via an optically thick disc @xcite is widely accepted as the engine to power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) in a bright state . in observation ,",
    "a search of evidence for bh accretion discs has long been pursued , and one important signature to look for is the predicted characteristic multi - temperature blackbody radiation . for bhxbs ( bh masses @xmath5 )",
    "the bulk of the disc blackbody emission , which has a maximum temperature @xmath10.51kev , falls within the readily observable x - ray bandpass , and the disc model has proven to be prevailing ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) . in agns habouring super - massive black holes ( smbh ) with typical @xmath6  and hence much lower",
    ", however , the situation is much less clear .",
    "the main difficulty lies in that the bulk of the disc emission falls within the far - to - extreme uv regime , which is not observable due to galactic absorption . while it is generally thought that the optical / uv `` big blue bump '' of agn is likely associated with disc emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some key issues have not been settled yet , however ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a long - standing puzzle is that , although the ( compton scattered ) wien tail of the disc blackbody emission is expected to plunge into the soft x - ray band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , convincing evidence remains illusive .",
    "indeed , a soft x - ray excess is commonly detected in agns ; however , their thermal temperatures , which appear to fall within a narrow range ( @xmath70.10.2kev ) , are too high to conform the disc model prediction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even with the effects of compton scattering taken into account @xcite . neither the inferred luminosities agree with the model values self - consistently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the independence of temperature on  found recently argues against the disc blackbody origin ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in general , the soft x - ray excess is suggested to have different origins from disc emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although there were limited previous attempts to link the soft x - ray excess with disc emission in a few agns , e.g.  mkn766 @xcite and rej1034 + 396 @xcite , whereby  and accretion rates were constrained from the x - ray ( and optical / uv ) data , the evidence is far from convincing .    in this paper",
    ", we report on an ultra - soft x - ray excess detected in an agn , whose thermal temperature ( @xmath730ev ) is among the lowest ever detected .",
    "we show that this emission is well consistent with blackbody radiation from an optically thick accretion disc around a smbh .",

    "the agn resides in one of a pair of galaxies , with the other a starburst galaxy separated by 4  @xcite .",
    "it is associated with a variable , invert spectrum radio source @xcite with an unresolved vlbi core at milli - arcsec resolution @xcite .",

    "its optical spectrum , acquired in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and analysed in ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus adopt a nominal value @xmath24 , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath25dex @xcite .",
    "the estimated eddington ratio is then = @xmath26 , using the above `` thermal '' bolometric luminosity .",
    "j1633 + 4718 was observed with the rosat pspc - b on axis with a 3732s exposure on july 24th , 1993 , and also detected during the rass ( pspc - c ) with a weighted exposure of 909s .",
    "the reduction and a brief analysis of the  data was presented in @xcite . to summarise",
    ", there are @xmath27 net source counts in the pointed observation and 185 counts in the rass .",
    "the 0.12.4kev spectrum can be well modeled with two components , an ultra - soft x - ray component dominating energies below 0.4kev and a flat power - law ( photon index @xmath28 ) dominating energies above 0.4kev ; the latter was interpreted as inverse compton emission from a relativistic jet @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the ultra - soft x - ray component and revisit the spectrum by performing a more detailed analysis .",
    "we use the pointed observation spectrum ( figure[fig : xspec ] ) to derive spectral parameters , given its much higher data signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) than that of the rass data .",
    "_ xspec _ ( v.12.5 ) is used to perform spectral fit .",
    "neutral absorption with a column density is always added in spectral models concerned .",
    "the galactic = @xmath29  on the line - of - sight , measured from the lab survey @xcite .",
    "the results are summarised in table1 .",
    "we first try a simple power - law model .",
    "the fit is unacceptable for fixing =  ( /d.o.f.=67/30 ) , underestimating severely the fluxes at both the low and high energies . setting  free",
    "still yields a poor fit , since the same systematic structures remain in the residuals and , even worse , resulting in little or no absorption .",
    "fitting the higher - energy ( 0.42.4kev ) spectrum only ( fixing = ) yields a good fit and a flat @xmath30(@xmath31 ) , while extrapolating this power - law to lower energies reveals a prominent soft x - ray excess , as shown in figure[fig : xspec ] ( middle panel ) .",
    "therefore an additional emission component is added to account for the soft x - ray excess , that is modeled by commonly adopted models including blackbody , power - law , thin plasma and thermal bremstrahlung . in general , all these models yield nearly the same excellent fits and the systematic structures in the residuals vanish",
    ". however , they can not be distinguished based on fitting statistics . for most of the models , and particularly blackbody ,",
    "the fitted  values are in good agreement with , albeit large uncertainties .",
    "we thus fix the absorption = when deriving spectral parameters ( table1 ) .",
    "as an example , the best - fit power - law plus blackbody model and the residuals are shown in figure[fig : xspec ] .",
    "we note that the addition of a second , relatively steep power - law continuum as in normal seyferts with fixed @xmath3223 is not required , indicating that it is negligible .",
    "interestingly , the fitted ( rest frame ) thermal temperatures are surprisingly low , e.g.  @xmath33ev for a ( redshifted ) blackbody .",
    "such an exceptionally low temperature is in remarkable contrast to the `` canonical '' @xmath10.10.2kev found for agns @xcite , and is perhaps the lowest with confident measurement known so far in a few objects were reported by @xcite based on _",
    "ipc+mpc data ; however , they were not confirmed in latter observations , e.g.  in mkn766 @xcite . ]",
    "( to our knowledge ) .",
    "in fact , the ultra - softness of this component is evident , as it dominates the emission below 0.4kev only .",
    "the _ overall _ blackbody luminosity is high , @xmath34 , whose confidence contours vs.  @xmath35 are shown in figure[fig : kt - lum ] .",
    "in fact , the blackbody luminosity is comparable to the `` thermal '' bolometric luminosity [ @xmath36 , which is remarkable considering the large uncertainty in the bolometric correction .",
    "hence we assume this ultra - soft x - ray emission as blackbody in nature .",
    "the spectrum measured in the rass has an almost identical spectral shape as that of the pointed observation .",
    "the best - fit parameters are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the pointed observation , with @xmath37 and the blackbody temperature @xmath38ev ( 90% confidence level ) , though the errors are large given the small source counts .",
    "the overall blackbody luminosity is found to be @xmath39 .",
    "there appears to be no detectable variation in either the spectral shape or the luminosity between the rass and pointed observation .",
    "assuming blackbody radiation , the size of the emitting area can be inferred as @xmath40 ( @xmath41 the stefan - boltzmann constant ) . for an assumed geometry of a sphere or a face - on disc , a radius @xmath42(or 7)@xmath43 cm ( @xmath10.30.5au ) is inferred , which is extremely compact for its high luminosity .",
    "in fact , these radii are merely several to ten times the schwarzschild radius of a bh at the mass estimated for ( @xmath44 cm ) .",
    "an immediate conclusion is that the soft x - ray emitting region must be extremely compact , e.g.  most likely in the close vicinity of the central bh .    in the standard bh accretion disc model",
    "the local effective temperature at a radius @xmath45 is @xmath46^{1/4 } \\\\ & = & 6.24\\times 10 ^ 5 \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm s}}\\right)^{-3/4 } \\left(1-\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{\\rm in}}{r}}\\right)^{1/4 } \\left(\\frac{m}{10 ^ 8 m_{\\odot}}\\right)^{-1/4 }   \\dot{m}^{1/4 } { \\rm ( k)}\\nonumber \\label{eq : teff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath47 is the radius of the inner boundary ( assumed to be the last marginally stable orbit ) of the disc , and @xmath48 the scaled accretion rate , with the eddington rate defined as @xmath49 , e.g.@xmath50gs@xmath9 assuming @xmath51 . for a non - rotating bh ( @xmath52 ) , from outer part",
    "inwards @xmath53 reaches its maximum @xmath54 at @xmath55 , and decreases again inwards . for = @xmath56  and assuming  as  ( = 0.69 ) , we find @xmath57 = 25.3ev , that is close to the fitted @xmath58ev . to our knowledge , this is by far the most convincing case where the soft x - ray excess temperature is well compatible with the predicted maximum disc temperature .",
    "we fit the spectrum with the commonly adopted multi - colour disc ( mcd , _ diskbb _ in _ xspec _ ) model @xcite .",
    "this model has been widely used in fitting the x - ray spectra of bhxbs , and found to provide reasonably good descriptions to the observed spectra at the high / soft state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with an approximation to the boundary condition",
    ", the mcd model has a monotonic temperature profile , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the effective temperature at the disc inner radius @xmath47 .",
    "this model should be sufficient for our purpose here , considering the moderate spectral s / n and resolution and the limited bandpass of the pspc data .",
    "the emergent mcd spectrum is determined by two parameters : the ( apparent ) radius of the inner boundary of the disc @xmath61 and the maximum ( colour ) temperature , which are related to the disc luminosity via @xmath62  and  can be derived from spectral fitting , where @xmath63 is the disc inclination angle . since the mcd model does not incorporate the redshift effect , which is small for  at @xmath12=0.116 though ,  and  in the object s rest frame are obtained by multiplying the fitted values with ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ( can be shown by using eq.[eq : discbblum ] ) , respectively .",
    "the _ true _ inner boundary radius is related to the apparent radius @xmath61 via @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is introduced to account for the inner boundary condition that is neglected in the mcd model @xcite .",
    "the disc inclination @xmath63 is expected to be a small angle given the blazar - like property of , i.e.  generally @xmath68 assuming disc  jet perpendicularity .",
    "in fact , for a wider range of @xmath63 , say @xmath69 ( as expected for type1 agns ) , the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath63 is weak .",
    "we thus expect @xmath71 , and hence @xmath72 .    to relate the observed spectrum to the true disc parameters corrections should be made to account for the spectral hardening effect , which gives rise to a shifted wien spectrum to a higher colour temperature due to incoherent compton scattering @xcite .",
    "the true effective  is then @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the spectral hardening factor .",
    "consequently , the true inner boundary radius @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath76 is somewhat uncertain , and @xmath77 was suggested @xcite based mostly on consideration of bhxbs and @xmath78 for smbhs with wide ranges of  and  @xcite .",
    "here we adopt @xmath79 .",
    "the spectrum is well fitted with the mcd plus a power - law model , with the fitted  consistent with . fixing =  yields the same excellent fit as using blackbody , giving = @xmath80ev and = @xmath81 cm in the object s rest frame ( table1 ) . applying the corrections in eqs.[eq : t_corr ] and [ eq : r_corr ] with @xmath82",
    ", we find a true maximum effective temperature = @xmath83ev and an inner disc radius = @xmath84 cm .",
    "the confidence contours of  and are shown in figure[fig : kt - rin ] .    assuming a non - rotating bh and @xmath85",
    ", we can derive its mass from x - rays , , and in turn  using  and eq.[eq : tmax ] .",
    "we find the best estimates @xmath86  and @xmath87 .",
    "the contours of confidence intervals for  and , as derived from those of  and  assuming @xmath88 , are shown in figure[fig : kt - rin ] ( right panel ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the x - ray spectrum provides relatively tight constraint on accretion rate .",
    "this is because the uncertainties of the derived  ( ) and , albeit large , are highly inversely coupled ( left panel ) and hence largely canceled mutually .",
    "these derived parameter values can be compared with those estimated from the optical spectrum ,  and  ( assumed as ) , and in turn   and ( using eq.[eq : tmax ] and assuming = 3 ) .",
    "their best estimates and uncertainty ranges are overplotted in figure[fig : kt - rin ] , as @xmath890.3dex in  @xcite and @xmath90 in the bolometric correction @xcite . remarkably , the results derived from the x - ray and optical observations agree strikingly well , albeit the relatively large uncertainties in both the measurements .",
    "this conclusion is basically not affected by the exact value of @xmath74 , provided @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the mcd model is only approximately correct since no general relativistic ( gr ) effects are taken into account .",
    "we make further corrections to the derived disc parameters due to the gr effects following the approach of @xcite .",
    "eqs.[eq : t_corr ] and [ eq : r_corr ] are then @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are temperature and flux correction factors , respectively . for a non - rotating bh and @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table1 ) .",
    "therefore the above  and  ( ) values should be further multiplied by a factor of 1.17 and 0.81 , respectively , i.e.  = @xmath99ev , @xmath100 cm , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "these parameter values are still marginally consistent with those derived from the optical spectrum ( figure[fig : kt - rin ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that we might be seeing the direct x - ray emission from an accretion disc around the smbh in , which has been long sought for agns .",
    "we note that , however , for a more realistic modeling , a relativistic disc model taking the gr effects fully into account should be used ( such as the kerrbb model of li et al .",
    "2005 ) . besides",
    ", we did not consider the bh spin here , that is also plausible ; e.g.  for a spinning bh and a prograde disc ,  would extend further inwards within 3 , i.e.  @xmath1033 , and   increases , resulting in an increased  and a reduced . furthermore , since the above found @xmath1040.3 , the effects of a slim disc ( abramowicz et al .  1988 , sadowski 2009 , li et al .",
    "2010 , see chapter10 of kato et al .",
    "2008 for a review ) may start to set in .",
    "we defer all these comprehensive treatments to future work , in a hope that it may shed light on the spin of the bh .",
    "having established the accretion disc emission model from the soft x - ray spectrum , it would be interesting to check whether this model is compatible with the observed broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of . the unfolded pspc spectrum and the fitted mcd plus power - law model ( dotted line )",
    "are shown in figure[fig : sed ] , along with the broad - band sed whose low - energy data are collected from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "interestingly , while the uv - to - infrared spectrum steepens towards lower frequencies , the _ galex _ far - uv measurement ( squares ) agrees roughly with the mcd model prediction .",
    "the lack of an obvious big - blue - bump in optical - uv supports that it is likely shifted to higher frequencies . as for the optical",
    " infrared bump , we interpret it as the high - energy tail of beamed synchrotron emission from the relativistic jets , in light of the blazar - like property of .",
    "we model this component with a parabolic function , a commonly used approximation to the synchrotron emission of blazars .",
    "the sum of this model and the above best - fit mcd model is fitted to the radio 5ghz , near - ir and optical / uv data , excluding the far - ir measurements from  and  ( crosses ; since they are most likely seriously contaminated , or even dominated by thermal emission of dust=0.53 is `` infrared warm '' , typical of starburst in the local universe @xcite . ] from the companion starburst galaxy 4away given the relatively poor spatial resolution of  and ) .",
    "as can be seen , such a synchrotron component ( dashed line ) can generally account for the sed at lower energies .",
    "therefore , the above accretion disc model , together with the other two emission components ( synchrotron and inverse - compton ) , is compatible with the observed broad - band sed of .",
    "moreover , the lack of detectable variation of the ultra - soft x - ray emission between the rass and pointed observations also supports the accretion disc model , since the thermal emission from an accretion disc is generally stable over such a relatively short timescale .",
    "we note that the starburst companion must fall within the source extraction region on the pspc detector plane due to its low spatial resolution .",
    "starburst also produces soft x - rays , which are related to the far - ir luminosity as @xmath105 . for the companion starburst galaxy ,",
    "an upper limit on @xmath106 can be set by the  measurements using @xmath107jy and @xmath108jy @xcite , yielding @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on the soft x - ray luminosity arising from the starburst @xmath111  only .",
    "such a contribution , if any , would be overwhelmed by the x - ray emission from the agn given the observed luminosity @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , the thermal temperatures of x - ray gases of starburst fall within a strict range of 0.30.7kev , far higher than the fitted 50ev for a thin plasma model ( table1 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the  spectrum of  is essentially not affected by any potential contamination from the starburst companion .",
    "an interesting question arises as to why  is so special and unique , in terms of previous unsuccessful attempts to ascribe the soft x - ray excess ( with the canonical temperatures of @xmath10.10.2kev ) to the direct thermal emission of the accretion discs in the vast majority of agns .",
    "this question will not be answered until the origin of the puzzling soft x - ray excess in many other agns is understood . nonetheless , we discuss some possibilities here , albeit somewhat speculative . in any case ,",
    "one important feature of  is its dominance of the disc thermal emission , which is a close analogue to the typical high / soft state in bhxbs ( relatively weak corona ; see above ) .",
    "this is different from many other agns in which the soft excess was investigated , where the spectral state is characterised by strong corona emission .",
    "one of the viable explanations of the soft excess is comptonisation of soft photons ( e.g. from discs ) off a region with electron temperature @xmath113kev and a large optical depth @xmath114 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,  may differ from the other agns in its environment surrounding the central engine , i.e. lacking this comptonisation region and the disc being directly seen in the line - of - sight , which may not be the case for the other agns .",
    "for instance , the difference may be due to the presence of jets ( and the face - on inclination of the disc ) in",
    ". it may be possible that in radio - quiet agns the comptonisation region is formed by aborted jets @xcite whose kinetic energy is converted to internal energy to heat electrons to the required temperature . in the case of ,",
    "the jets are successfully launched , however , clearing the way to the central disc along the line - of - sight .",
    "it is interesting to note that in 3c273 , a well - known agn with relativistic jets , a relatively low blackbody temperature of the soft excess was also reported ( @xmath115ev ; grandi & palumbo 2004 ; although in that work the accretion disc origin was not tested in terms of matching the x - ray data with the predicted temperature and luminosity of the disc , as we did here ) .",
    "whether or not this can be generalised to other radio - loud agns needs further investigations , though it should be reminded that the jets of radio - loud nls1s might be different from those of classical radio quasars , e.g.  with reduced physical size and power @xcite .",
    "an alternative model is disk reflection in which the observed soft x - ray excess can be explained as relativistically blurred line emission of the reflection component from a highly ionized inner disc , that somehow dominates the primary emission @xcite .",
    "the postulation of this model is the presence of the primary x - ray emission , presumably from a disc corona of high - temperature and low - optical depth .",
    "it may be possible that in  the disc corona is significantly suppressed somehow , for instance , due to the formation of the jets ( the energy goes into the jets instead of to the corona ) or to the relatively high mass accretion rate .",
    "this would lead to a week reflection component in  and thus has no significant soft excess in the usual form , while the disc thermal emission stands out . in this line , as mentioned above , the seyfert - like x - ray component in the  spectrum of  is too weak to be detected .    finally , for agns with high black hole masses ( @xmath116 ) and",
    "relatively low accretion rates , even if the other conditions ( jets , corona , etc . ) resemble those of , the thermal disc emission may have too low temperatures to be detectable above the low - energy cutoff of commonly used x - ray detectors ( @xmath117kev ) .",
    "future observations of more agns similar to  may shed light on under what conditions the direct thermal emission of accretion discs can be detected in x - ray .",
    "we have shown that the ultra - soft x - ray excess discovered in can be well and self - consistently described by thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disc around a smbh .",
    "the derived parameters ( , , and ) agree with the independent estimates based on the optical spectrometric data .",
    "we thus consider this emission as a signature of x - rays from an accretion disc around a smbh , presenting possible evidence for bh accretion discs in agns . as such ,",
    "is an agn analog of bhxbs at the high / soft state in a sense that the accretion disc emission dominates the bolometric luminosity .",
    "more importantly , one may infer the spin of the bh , as succeeded in bhxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be achieved with future improved observations , which , if successful , would provide a testbed for studying the link of bh spin and the formation of relativistic jets in agns",
    ". finally , it is intriguing why  is so unique among the many agns observed in the soft x - rays , which may be addressed with future investigations .",

    "<S> the thermal temperature of this emission , when fitted with a blackbody , is as low as @xmath0ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is in remarkable contrast to the canonical temperatures of @xmath10.10.2kev found hitherto for the soft x - ray excess in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and is interestingly close to the maximum temperature predicted for a postulated accretion disc in this object . if this emission is indeed blackbody in nature , the derived luminosity ( @xmath2 ) infers a compact emitting area with a size ( @xmath3 cm or 0.33au in radius ) that is comparable to several times the schwarzschild radius of a black hole at the mass estimated for this agn ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this ultra - steep x - ray emission can be well fitted as the ( compton scattered ) wien tail of the multi - temperature blackbody emission from an optically thick accretion disc , whose parameters inferred ( black hole mass and accretion rate ) are in good agreement with independent estimates using optical emission line spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider this feature as a signature of the long - sought x - ray radiation directly from a disc around a super - massive black hole , presenting observational evidence for a black hole accretion disc in agn . </S>",
    "<S> future observations with better data quality , together with improved independent measurements of the black hole mass , may constrain the spin of the black hole . </S>"
