    "in fact , mid - infrared observations with irac aboard of _ spitzer _ have discovered a lot of new outflows @xcite and plenty new features of previously known outflows @xcite , showing that _ spitzer _ irac imaging is a powerful tool in the survey of outflows , particular for those that are deeply embedded in clouds due to the much less extinction in the mid - infrared compared to the optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the _ spitzer _ legacy program _",

    "[ fig13 ] we can see that the symmetry axis of the ego 41 bowlike structure goes through ego 42 and iras 16293 - 2422 .",
    "this axis coincides well with the axis of the iras 16293 - 2422 ne - sw molecular outflow ( see fig .",
    "12 in @xcite ) , suggesting that egos 41 and 42 may have physical association with this molecular outflow which is attributed to the a component of iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "we note that the ego 41 bow shock points to source iras 16293 - 2422 .",
    "this morphology usually suggests that the driving source is located on the direction opposite to iras 16293 - 2422 .",
    "however , bow shocks are not always in a configuration of facing away from their driving sources . for example , the hh 311 bow shock @xcite and the southeastern bow shock of the v380 ori - ne flow @xcite are in a configuration facing toward their exciting sources . this configuration can be understood if the flow impacts a dense , ambient clump , around which shocked gas is streaming @xcite .",

    "[ fig41 ] . the grey scale image in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] is the irac 4.5  emission and the contours give @xmath3co 1 - 0 emission in the region .",
    "it can be seen that mid - infrared outflows , hh objects , and molecular co outflows roughly have the same spatial distribution and they are in general concentrated in regions with high gas density , particularly in the region of the l1688 dense core",
    ". however , difference in the distribution of mid - infrared outflows , hh objects , and molecular co outflows are apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] .",
    "first , a substantial number of hh objects , 17 out of 46 that are detected in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud @xcite , are located in regions of @xmath3co 1 - 0 emission less than 2k , while none of mid - infrared outflows and molecular co outflows are detected in these regions of relatively low gas density .",
    "this result may indicate that the excitation of mid - infrared and co molecular outflows require more dense surrounding medium than hh objects .",
    "secondly , we can see that in the core of the l1688 cloud mid - infrared outflows are distributed in the northern and southern parts of the core while there are several co molecular outflows detected in the middle of the core . using outflows as a tracer of current star formation , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] that the core of the l1688 cloud is much more active in current star formation than the core of the l1689 cloud .    the distribution of yso candidates in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig42 ] .",
    "ysos in this region are mainly concentrated in the l1688 cloud core .",
    "we note that abundant ysos are located in the region to the northwest of the l1688 cloud core though there is little dense gas in this region .",
    "in fact this part of the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud hosts four class i and two flat - spectrum sources .",
    "however , no mid - infrared outflows are detected in this region ( see fig .  [ fig42 ] ) .",
    "the non - detection of mid - infrared outflows in this region may be due to that little dense gas remains in this region .",
    "several extensive surveys have been made toward the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud for millimeter sources ( mmss ) and sub - millimeter sources ( smms ) @xcite .",
    "the mmss and smms detected in these surveys are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig43 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the detected mmss and smms are exclusively distributed in the l1688 cloud core and the l1689 cloud core .",
    "the l1689 cloud core , hosting about 33 mmss and smms , is comparable to the l1688 cloud core , which hosts about 31 mmss and smms .",
    "however , we have seen that the l1688 cloud core hosts much more outflows and ysos than the l1689 cloud core , which may mean that the mmss and smms in the l1689 cloud core are in general in earlier evolutionary stages than those in the l1688 cloud cores and that they are mainly prestellar cores .",
    "the distributions of ouflows , ysos , and mmss and smms suggest a global star formation history in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud which may be that the star formation in this region took place first in the northwestern part of the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud and most dense gas in this region has been dispersed .",
    "the l1688 cloud core is now undergoing active star formation while most of the dense cores in the l1689 cloud are still at the prestellar stages .",
    "this result is consistent with the suggestion that star formation in ophiuchus is triggered by ionisation fronts and winds from the upper scorpius ob association which is located to the west of the @xmath0 ophiuchi cloud @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we detected 13 new mid - infrared outflows in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud that have not been detected previously at other wavelengths .",
    "in addition , 31 mid - infrared outflows which correspond to previously detected hh objects or near - infrared emission are detected as well .",
    "seven of these mid - infrared outflow features correspond to previously detected hh objects and 30 to near - infrared emission .",
    "most of the detected mid - infrared outflows are concentrated in the dense core of the l1688 cloud , with only twelve of which locating outside of this core . in combination with the distribution of ysos and mmss and smms in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud , the distribution of mid - infrared outflows hints a propagation of star formation in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular complex in the direction from northwest to southeast .",
