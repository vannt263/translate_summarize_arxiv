    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are thermonuclear detonations of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ; @xcite ) . the exact mechanism leading to the explosion",
    "is debated .",
    "four viable scenarios for sne ia are currently considered : ( a ) the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which a wd accretes mass from a non - degenerate stellar companion ; ( b ) the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which a merger of two wds takes place .",
    "recent papers discuss violent merger and collision ( e.g. , @xcite ) as an ignition channel of the dd scenario ; ( c ) the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which a wd merges with a hot core of a massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star ; ( d ) the double - detonation mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd accumulates on its surface a layer of helium - rich material , which can detonate and lead to a second detonation near the center of the co wd ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent paper ) .    in the violent merger model",
    "@xcite it is possible that in the merger process of the two wds the helium is ignited first . in this mechanism",
    "both the dd and the double detonation operate @xcite .",
    "the double detonation might operate in the cd scenario as well , with or without a violent merger . in both the sd and the cd scenarios ,",
    "a circumstellar shell can be formed by ejecting the companion ( to the wd ) stellar envelope close to the explosion time .",
    "this ejection can be accompanied by the formation of jets launched from an accretion disk . in the sd scenario",
    "the disk is formed during the mass accretion process onto the wd , while in the cd scenario the disk is formed either around the core from the destructed wd material , or around the wd from the destructed core .",
    "the formation of a disk as a result of merger of two wds was discussed before , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for recent papers .",
    "another possibility in the cd scenario is that the wd accretes mass from the giant stellar envelope and launches two opposite jets before merging with the giant s core",
    ". such circumstellar matter ( csm ) shells are similar to some planetary nebulae ( pns ) , as the central wd ionizes the csm .",
    "when the sn is finally ignited , the wd mass in the sd scenario and the merger product mass in the cd scenario is expelled by the explosion at high velocities of up to @xmath0 .",
    "if the explosion occurs within @xmath1 from the csm ejection episode , we have a sn ia exploding inside a pn or a pn - like object .",
    "the exploding gas catches up with the dense ( relative to the interstellar medium ; ism ) csm and interacts with it .    in this paper",
    "we study the interaction of sn ia ejecta with a pn ( or pn - like ) shell .",
    "observations show that some of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) exhibit non - spherical morphologies , including axi - symmetrical morphologies resembling the structures of some pne .",
    "an example is the kepler snr that possesses two opposite protrusions which are termed ` ears ' ( after the nomenclature used in @xcite ) .",
    "another example is the g299.2 - 2.9 snr . for the general discussion ( not limited to kepler or g299.2 - 2.9 snrs )",
    ", we will refer to these protrusions as ears.    the motivation for this work comes from the expectation that jets will be formed in some sn ia scenarios , and may suggest an explanation to the observed two ears of the kepler snr and the g299.2 - 2.9 snr .",
    "the ears are marked on an the x - ray images of these two snrs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : observations ] .",
    "we perform 3d hydrodynamical simulations of such sn explosions and study the interaction of the expelled material with the csm .",
    "the numerical code and initial setting and conditions are described in section [ sec : numerical ] , while in section [ sec : results ] we demonstrate that the double ears and similar morphological features can be explained by jets that are launched during the pre - explosion phase .",
    "our discussion and comparison with the snrs kepler and g299.2 - 2.9 are in section [ sec : comparison ] , and a short summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the simulations are performed using the high - resolution multidimensional hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "we employ a full 3d uniform grid ( all cells have the same size ) with cartesian @xmath2 geometry . in all runs but one",
    "each axis has 512 cells and a total length of @xmath3 . in one",
    "run each axis still has 512 cells but @xmath4 .",
    "we use radiative cooling for solar metallicity values , according to @xcite , although radiative cooling has a minor role in our simulations .",
    "the ejected material is metal - rich ( see a recent paper by @xcite ) and the cooling of the shocked ejecta is expected to be more efficient than what the cooling function mentioned above gives . however , this difference in not significant for the duration of our simulations and does not play a significant role in the shaping of the ears.    there are two scenarios for forming various shapes of the csm during the stage prior to sn ia explosion . in the sd scenario the wd grows in mass through accretion from a non - degenerate stellar companion . if the companion is an evolved agb star it might blow large parts of its envelope , as progenitors of pne do .",
    "the accretion onto the wd takes place via an accretion disk , which enables jets to be formed .",
    "the jets can blow two opposite small lobes ( ears ) in the nebula as observed in some pne .",
    "examples of elliptical pne with ears are ngc  6563 @xcite , ngc  7139 , ic  418 , and ngc 3242 ( @xcite ; their images can be seen in the planetary nebula image catalogue ) .",
    "we note that in some cases the two ears are not exactly symmetric to each other . as well , in some pne there are indications that the ears are formed by jets .    in the cd scenario @xcite the common envelope ( ce )",
    "phase is terminated by a merger of a wd companion with the hot core of a massive agb star . however , in the cases where the merger takes place when the wd is denser than the core , the core will be disrupted and accreted onto the cooler wd . in such cases the explosion might occur shortly , months to tens of years , after the merger process .",
    "whereas in the sd scenario the shaping of ears by jets is only of the csm shell , in the cd scenario the shaping can occur both in the csm and/or during the core - wd merger . in the rare cases when the sn explosion occurs within @xmath5 from the formation of the csm",
    ", jets can be formed prior to the explosion and , together with the high - velocity sn ejecta , collide with the csm and lead to formation of specific features in the snr .",
    "this type of interaction might form sn ia remnants that in general possess a large scale spherical symmetry , but have small , notably axisymmteric , departures from sphericity .",
    "we examine whether the formation of the ears in the snrs of kepler and g299.2 - 2.9 can be explained by such process .",
    "we note that protrusions can also be formed by bullets ploughing through the shell , as suggested by recent simulations of tycho s snr and sn 1006 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that knots of sn ejecta can overtake the forward shock and form low density bubbles around the rim of the snr .",
    "however , these features appear only for one specific simulated case having an adiabatic index of @xmath6 , and are absent entirely from other simulations .",
    "we aim at two opposite protrusions in an axisymmetrical structure , rather than at randomly distributed protrusions .    based on the above discussion",
    "we simulate the two scenarios for the formation of protrusions .",
    "one scenario sets the asymmetry in the pn shell long before the explosion , while the other assumes the launching of two opposite jets very shortly before the explosion .",
    "based on these , we conduct simulations with two types of initial setups of explosion inside a csm shell . ( a ) _ csm - lobes model : _ a spherical shell with two hollow small lobes , mimicking the structure of such two opposite small lobes observed in some elliptical pns .",
    "the initial distribution of the sn ejecta is spherically symmetric .",
    "( b ) _ pre - explosion jets ( pej ) model : _ a completely spherical csm shell , with two jets added inside the otherwise spherical sn ejecta .",
    "this can occur only in the cd scenario during the core - wd merger process @xcite .",
    "the sn ejecta density is modeled by an exponential density profile @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant which depends on the mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta , @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a parameter given by @xmath14 the maximum velocity of the sn ejecta is taken to be @xmath15 .",
    "each simulation starts roughly @xmath16 after the explosion took place . by this time the fastest ejecta reached @xmath17 from the center of the explosion .",
    "the total energy of the explosion is set to be @xmath18 , and the mass ejected in the explosion is @xmath19 .",
    "the csm initial profile is set to be a constant density @xcite , @xmath20 , shell within radii @xmath21 , so that the total mass of the csm shell is @xmath22 .",
    "the mass is based on the estimated csm mass in the kepler snr @xcite .",
    "the ambient ism density is taken to be @xmath23 @xcite .    in the small csm - lobes model ,",
    "some of the mass of the csm envelope is pushed outward to form the ears. each small - lobe has an initial half - spherical shell structure within radii @xmath24 from the center of the small - lobe .",
    "we assume that the small csm - lobes are formed by jets with low mass , and hence take the total mass of the csm in the small - lobes to be the same as the csm shell segments they replaced . as",
    "the width of the small lobes is as that of the csm , the density in the small lobes is lower than that in the csm , and amounts to a value of @xmath25 .",
    "the initial setup of the small csm - lobes is shown in fig .",
    "[ subfigure : lobesscheme ] .    in the pej model",
    ", jets are added to the explosion itself .",
    "the reason is that in the cd scenario the jets might occur during the core - wd merger @xcite , and the explosion may occur very shortly after the merger , e.g. , as in the violent merger ignition model of @xcite .",
    "the jets are expected to be launched at about the escape velocity from the massive and compact wd , @xmath26 , not much different from the sn explosion velocity . to make the model simple",
    ", we set the velocity and density radial profiles of the jets to be same as that of the sn ejecta , but take the density in the jets to be 3 times larger that that of the sn ejecta at the same radius .",
    "the mass of each jet is @xmath27 and the half - opening angle of the jets is @xmath28 .",
    "the initial setup of the pej model is shown in fig .",
    "[ subfigure : jetsscheme ] .    to have better understanding of the process of interaction of the sn ejecta with the csm at early times ( up to @xmath29 ) we perform one additional simulation that focuses on the region within the initial radius of the csm shell . in this setup",
    "each axis still has 512 cells but is only @xmath30 in length , so that the effective resolution is increased significantly in comparison to the simulation runs described above .",
    "the numerical @xmath31 @xmath32 plane is taken to be in the plane containing the central explosion and the two ears or jets .",
    "initially this plane is a symmetry plane , but we simulate the entire space , so that we assume no symmetry about the @xmath33 axis at @xmath34 .",
    "as the sn ejecta hits the csm , part of the kinetic energy of the ejecta is deposited in the csm shell , and the csm is accelerated outward .",
    "two shock waves are formed .",
    "the first shock runs outward into the csm , and then passes to the ism .",
    "the second shock is a reverse shock that runs inward into the incoming ejecta .",
    "there are two contact discontinuities in the flow , one between the shocked ejecta and the shocked csm , and the other between the csm and ism ( initially preshock media , later shocked media ) .",
    "the shocks are clearly seen in all panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : densityplots ] and [ fig : densityplots2 ] , and are marked on panel [ subfigure : densears2 ] . by ism",
    "we refer to the medium outside the dense csm shell .",

    "[ fig : otherplots ] , and is marked on panel [ subfigure : jetstemperature ] .    in our flow",
    "setting the shocked csm is denser than the shocked ejecta .",
    "therefore , as the shocked ejecta accelerates the shocked csm , the flow becomes rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) unstable , leading to the formation of ` rt fingers ' and the penetration of the two media into each other .",
    "the fingers are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : densityplots ] , and are marked on panel [ subfigure : densears2 ] .",
    "similar instabilities are present in sn ia simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "the shocked ism is of lower density than the shocked csm .",
    "as the shocked ism slows down the shocked csm this contact discontinuity also becomes rt unstable .",
    "these unstable regions are best presented in panels [ subfigure : jetsrt1 ] and [ subfigure : jetsrt2 ] , as described next .",
    "the post shock csm gas is heated up to temperatures @xmath35 , and slowly cools down mainly via adiabatic cooling . for our initial conditions",
    "the radiative cooling time scale of the shocked csm is @xmath36 , whereas the flow time in our simulation is up to @xmath37 .",
    "the initial departure from spherical symmetry ( see fig . [",
    "subfigure : densears1 ] and [ subfigure : densjets1 ] ) is magnified in absolute size by the sweeping sn ejecta as the lobes are inflated from within by the ejecta - csm interaction ( see fig .",

    "is formed along the symmetry axis .",
    "+   +    the outflow in the inner part of the snr at late simulation times is mostly governed by the low - velocity ejecta that was located close to the center of the sn explosion in the beginning of the simulation .",
    "our modeling of this slow ejecta is not accurate due to numerical limitations ( pixel size ) , thus the simulation results of the innermost regions ( up to @xmath38 at @xmath39 ) of the snr are of limited accuracy .",
    "the overall `` clumpiness '' of the regions dominated by rt fingers resembles the fleecy structure analysed in @xcite for the interiors of type ia snrs .    as the differences between the results of the csm - lobes ( fig .",

    "this ratio is calculated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the typical size of the rt instabilities and @xmath44 is the pressure gradient in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "we scale @xmath43 as a fraction of the initial csm shell width , @xmath45 , and take it to be , somewhat arbitrarily , @xmath46 .",
    "the exact value is of no significance for our analysis .",
    "@xmath43 equals 1.6 times cell size .",
    "+    in addition to the nominal resolution runs whose results are presented above , we perform a high - resolution simulation that focuses on early times ( around the time of the initial interaction of the sn ejecta with the csm shell ) , before the csm shell expanded to higher radii . in this run",

    "we attempt to match some of the features in our numerical results with some morphological features in the snrs kepler and g299.2 - 2.9 .",
    "the x - ray emission from the asymmetrical kepler s snr has been studied in the past , recently by @xcite .",
    "they interpret the observed distribution of csm in kepler s snr as resulting from a disk seen edge - on , which extends from the center of the snr along the line that marks our proposed symmetry axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : observations ] .",
    "our interpretation of the observations is different , in that we propose that the line connecting the two ears is actually a symmetry axis and not the equatorial plane .",
    "our conjecture of the direction of the symmetry axis is based on similar interpretations applied to planetary nebulae that possess similar double - ear morphologies ( see section [ sec : numerical ] ) . following these interpretations we here attribute",

    "in particular , we examine the kepler and g299.2 - 2.9 snrs .",
    "the exact reconstruction of the expected x - ray emission map from our simulations is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , as x - ray emission magnitude is proportional to the square of the density we can make a qualitative comparison by constructing an ` intensity map ' by simply integrating @xmath56 along the line of sight ( a similar approach was used in @xcite ) .",
