    "information about the symmetry energy of hot neutron - rich matter is important for understanding the dynamical evolution of massive stars and the supernova explosion mechanisms , while the symmetry energy at zero temperature is important for determining properties of neutron stars at @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the electron capture rate on nuclei and/or free protons in pre - supernova explosions is especially sensitive to the symmetry energy at finite temperatures .",
    "the electron captures drive the collapsing core towards more neutron - rich matter .",
    "they affect not only the electron degenerate pressure working against the gravity but also the neutrino fluxes carrying away energy from the corebethe79,lat01,heger01,steiner05 .",
    "the larger the symmetry energy , the more difficult it is for the electron captures to happen .",
    "heavy - ion reactions are a unique means to produce in terrestrial laboratories the hot neutron - rich matter similar to those existing in many astrophysical situations .",
    "the possibility of extracting useful information about the symmetry energy from heavy - ion reactions has stimulated much interest in the nuclear physics community @xcite . especially , recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion reactions betty04,chen05,lichen05 and the size of neutron - skin in @xmath1pb steiner , jorge05,chenkl have already put a stringent constraint on the symmetry energy of cold neutron - rich matter at sub - normal densities .",
    "this has led to a significantly more refined constraint on the mass - radius correlation of neutron stars @xcite including the fastest pulsar discovered very recently @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy for hot neutron - rich matter has received so far little theoretical attention .    among the phenomena",
    "/ observables identified as potentially useful probes of the nuclear symmetry energy , the isoscaling coefficients of fragments from heavy - ion reactions @xcite have been most extensively studied , see e.g. , @xcite for a recent review .",
    "very interestingly , it was found recently that the extracted symmetry energy from the isoscaling analyses decreases significantly from its standard value of about @xmath2 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xmath3 to much smaller values with the increasing excitation energy or centrality in heavy - ion reactions at both fermi @xcite and relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "moreover , an increasing temperature of the fragmenting system was found to accompany the decreasing symmetry energy in these reactions .",
    "however , the fundamental origin of this apparent evolution of the symmetry energy is still not clear and it is particularly important and interesting to understand to what degree the evolution is due to the density and/or the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy .    in this work , it is shown that the experimentally observed evolution of the symmetry energy can be well understood within a degenerate fermi gas model at finite temperatures .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the evolution of the symmetry energy is mainly due to the variation in the freeze - out density rather than temperature when the fragments are emitted in the reactions carried out under different conditions .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of hot neutron - rich matter at a temperature @xmath4 and an isospin asymmetry @xmath5 can be written as @xcite @xmath6the temperature and density dependent symmetry energy @xmath7 for hot neutron - rich matter can thus be extracted from @xmath8 .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath7 is the energy cost to convert all protons in symmetry matter to neutrons at the fixed temperature @xmath4 and density @xmath9 . for finite nuclei at temperatures below about @xmath10 mev ,",
    "the shell structure and pairing as well as vibrations of nuclear surfaces are important and the symmetry energy was predicted to increase slightly with the increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , an increase by only about @xmath11 in the symmetry energy in the range of @xmath4 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 mev was found to affect appreciably the physics of stellar collapse , especially the neutralization processes@xcite . at higher temperatures ,",
    "one expects the symmetry energy to decrease as the pauli blocking becomes less important when the nucleon fermi surfaces become more diffused at increasingly higher temperatures @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the thermal model of mekjian , lee and zamick ( mlz ) @xcite .",
    "while all of our results have also been concurrently verified numerically by using the finite temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) approach using both skyrme and gogny forces @xcite , here we utilize the mlz approach because of its analytically transparent properties .",
    "the results obtained within the mlz approach are sufficient for the purposes of this work .",
    "our studies based on the finite temperature hf calculations will be reported elsewhere chen06 .",
    "the degenerate fermi gas limit of the mlz thermal model is appropriate for us to understand quantitatively the experimentally observed evolution of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath14 has a kinetic contribution and an interaction part . in the mlz model with skyrme interactions ,",
    "the interaction part is temperature independent , i.e. , @xmath15 at low temperatures , it is known that all mean field quantities are essentially temperature independent @xcite . with even momentum - dependent gogny forces , at temperatures relevant for fragment formation in heavy - ion reactions , our hf calculations indicate that the interaction part @xmath16 is only slightly @xmath4-dependent . for temperatures much less than the fermi energy , @xmath17 , the kinetic energy per nucleon of a near - degenerate two - component fermi gas is @xcite @xmath18where @xmath19 is the reduced density . the kinetic part of the symmetry energy is thus @xmath20it is interesting to note that the @xmath21 decreases with @xmath22 with a rate depending on the density . on the other hand , for @xmath23",
    "the system becomes a non - degenerate classical gas with a kinetic symmetry energy of @xcite @xmath24,\\]]where @xmath25 is the thermal wavelength of nucleons with an average mass @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen that the symmetry energy decreases approximately according to @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the genuine feature of a decreasing symmetry energy associated with an increasing temperature at both the degenerate and non - degenerate fermi gas limits is consistent with predictions of the microscopic and/or phenomenological many - body theories chen01,zuo03,horowitz , rou , chen06 .    at the typical freeze - out temperatures and densities for the emission of intermediate mass fragments in heavy - ion reactions , the degenerate fermi gas limit is appropriate except at extremely low densities where clustering effects may become important @xcite . to evaluate the relative importance of the @xmath4-dependent part @xmath29 with respect to the total symmetry energy for cold neutron - rich matter",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "1 the ratio @xmath30 . the analyses of the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu @xcite and the study on the size of neutron - skin in @xmath1pb @xcite have recently consistently constrained the symmetry energy of cold matter to be around @xmath31 at sub - normal densities . using the above two limits for the @xmath32 at a typical freeze - out temperature of @xmath33 mev for the fragment emission in heavy - ion reactions , it is seen that the ratio @xmath34 increases quickly with decreasing density .",
    "the @xmath4-dependent part of the symmetry energy becomes increasingly more appreciable , e.g. , up to about @xmath35 at @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , since the ratio increases quadratically with @xmath4 , the effect will be much larger at higher temperatures .",
    "this result also shows the magnitude , especially at low densities and/or high temperatures , of some artificial effects that would be introduced should one attribute the entire evolution of the symmetry energy to its density dependence while neglecting its intrinsic temperature dependence .",
    "corresponding to the above two limits for the @xmath38 , the interaction part of the symmetry energy @xmath39 is constrained between @xmath40 ( labeled as @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( labeled as @xmath43 ) chen05,lichen05 . with this @xmath39 and eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we can now examine the evolution of the total symmetry energy ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) as functions of density and temperature . shown in fig .",
    "2 is the evolution of the normalized symmetry energy @xmath44/e_{sym}(\\rho _ { 0},0 ) $ ] as a function of temperature at sub - saturation densities .",
    "it is seen that in the temperature range considered here , the symmetry energy does not change much with temperature at a given density .",
    "it is interesting to mention that using the same gogny interactions corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath43 @xcite in the finite temperature hf approach , all of the major results discussed above are qualitatively reproduced @xcite .",
    "the major physical features given by the mlz thermal model are thus rather general .",
    "it has been observed in many types of reactions that the ratio @xmath46 of yields of a fragment with proton number @xmath47 and neutron number @xmath48 from two reactions reaching about the same temperature @xmath4 satisfies an exponential relationship @xmath49betty01,shetty , sjy , indra , henz , tsang01,botvina , ono , dorso , ma . in several statistical and dynamical models under some assumptionstsang01,botvina , ono",

    "( [ scaling ] ) and the physical meaning of @xmath55 are in order .",
    "first of all , we notice that eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) is an approximation in equilibrium models and an empirical assumption in dynamical models where isoscaling is observed in generated events . because of the different assumptions used in the various derivations , the validity of this equation is still disputable as to whether and when the @xmath55 is actually the symmetry energy or the symmetry free energy .",
    "moreover , the physical interpretation of the @xmath51 is also not clear , sometimes even contradictory , in the literature .",
    "the main issue is whether the @xmath55 measures the symmetry energy of the fragmentating source or that of the fragments formed at freeze - out .",
    "this ambiguity is also due to the fact that the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) is not unique . in particular , within the grand canonical statistical model for multifragmentation@xcite the @xmath55 refers to the symmetry energy of primary fragments . while within the sequential weisskopf model in the grand canonical limit@xcite it refers to the symmetry energy of the emission source .",
    "based on the grand canonical model for multifragmentation , some experts take the view that the @xmath55 is the symmetry energy of the fragments at the freeze - out .",
    "moreover , they use the finite size effects , such as the surface symmetry energy and its temperature dependence , to explain the observed smaller value of @xmath55 compared to the symmetry energy of about 30 mev for cold nuclear matter at the saturation density .",
    "however , from the very nature of the isoscaling phenomenon itself that isotopes / isotones having very different masses ( sizes ) fall on the same curve described by a single scaling coefficient , it is hard to believe that the finite - size effects have any influence on the @xmath55 at all . in another word , unless the finite size effects on both the @xmath55 and the temperature @xmath4 , if there is any at all , are completely cancelled out , the isoscaling phenomenon should not have been observed in multifragmentation in the first place .",
    "indeed , in the amd analyses of isoscaling in multifragmentation , it was found that `` _ the extracted symmetry energy shows almost no surface effect in it , which suggests that the properties of infinite nuclear matter can be directly obtained from the information of fragmentation_''@xcite .    within the grand canonical model for multifragmentation , another possible reason for the extracted small value of @xmath55",
    "is that fragments themselves at freeze - out are dilute .",
    "this picture , however , seems to contradict the basic fisher hypothesis that correlations inside a dilute medium are exhausted by clusterization .",
    "one possible explanation put forward was that primary fragments formed in heavy - ion reactions are hot and thus also expanded @xcite .",
    "however , this explanation is insufficient to explain the much smaller value of @xmath55 observed in central collisions .",
    "moreover , the isoscaling phenomenon is actually observed experimentally for cold fragments .",
    "the sequential decay of hot primary fragments may not affect much the isoscaling coefficient .",
    "we notice that this is still a matter of hot debate depending on the model calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , with this view the small value of @xmath55 for cold fragments extracted in the isoscaling experiments would indeed indicate that the fragments have dilute internal density .",
    "this would require a deep reconsideration of the statistical models from which eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) was derived .    to this end , it is necessary to repeat here some remarks made by one of us at the wci3 meeting@xcite .",
    "while the eq.([scaling ] ) is a good approximation within the grand canonical statistical model for multifragmentation , the isoscaling coefficient @xmath56 is sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy _ not _ because of the @xmath55 which should be the symmetry energy of normal nuclear matter , _ but rather _ because of the @xmath57 ratios of the fragmentating sources through the dynamical isospin fractionation@xcite in the early stage of the reaction .",
    "this was also pointed out recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , since the @xmath57 ratio of the effective fragmentating source , if exists at all , is not directly accessible experimentally , simplified assumptions are normally made in the data analyses within both statistical and dynamical models .",
    "the efforts are normally misplaced on extracting the @xmath55 as if it is the one depending on the density and temperature .",
    "consequently , the extracted @xmath55 may thus contain some information about the density dependence of the symmetry energy that is actually carried by the @xmath57 ratios of the fragmentating sources .    on the other hand , within the sequential weisskopf model in the grand canonical limit@xcite , all quantities in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) refer to the emission source . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath55 itself in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) reflects the bulk symmetry energy of the low density fragmentating source .",
    "besides , because of the way by which the data is analyzed as we mentioned above , the experimentally extracted @xmath55 also contains information about the symmetry energy through the @xmath57 ratios of the fragmentatig sources . here",
    "we thus use broadly a working assumption that the @xmath55 reflects the symmetry energy of bulk nuclear matter .",
    "we notice that this assumption can be justified only in the sequential weisskopf model . nevertheless , it is interesting and reassuring to note that this assumption is consistent with the statement in ref .",
    "@xcite that _ the @xmath55 is the symmetry energy of uniform nuclear matter at a reduced density_. within this picture it is natural for the @xmath55 to have values smaller than the symmetry energy of normal nuclear matter .",
    "one would thus have no difficulty with the fisher hypothesis for fragment formation . at freeze - out",
    ", fragments are formed at their normal density in a large volume .",
    "only the average density in the freeze - out volume is small .",
    "we would also like to stress here that the @xmath51 extracted from studying the isoscaling coefficient @xmath50 is the total symmetry energy at the finite temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it should be distinguished from the symmetry energy at zero temperature extracted from transport model analyses of dynamical observables , such as the isospin diffusion , or that from studying the neutron - skins of heavy nuclei . in transport models ,",
    "the nucleon mean field or effective interaction for cold nuclear matter is used as an input .",
    "the zero temperature symmetry energy as a function of density can thus be constructed analytically from the particular mean fields or effective interactions used in the calculations .",
    "special cares should thus be taken when comparing the density functions for nuclear symmetry energy extracted from different approaches and/or results from the same approach but for reactions at different temperatures , especially at low densities .    within our working assumption that the extracted @xmath55 from isoscaling analyses is the symmetry energy of the fragmenting source , we can then compare the experimental @xmath55 with our calculations of the symmetry energy for uniform nuclear matter . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the experimental data taken from the sjy group at texas a&m university ( filled circles ) @xcite and the indra - aladin collaboration at gsi ( open squares ) @xcite are compared with the calculations . in the tamu experiments , combinations of projectile - like fragments from peripheral to semiperipheral collisions of @xmath2 mev / nucleon @xmath58kr and @xmath59ni beams on several neutron - rich targets",
    "were used in the isoscaling analyses .",
    "the symmetry energy was found to decrease quickly from about @xmath2 mev to @xmath60 mev as the temperature increases from about @xmath61 mev to @xmath62 mev @xcite .",
    "the indra@gsi data were obtained from the fragmentation of target - like residues following collisions of @xmath63c on @xmath64sn targets at a beam energy of @xmath65 mev / nucleon .",
    "the indra@gsi data indicate that the symmetry energy decreases from about @xmath66 mev to @xmath67 mev as the temperature increases from about @xmath68 mev to @xmath69 mev when the reaction goes from peripheral to central collisions @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to compare the calculations using both the @xmath45 ( upper window ) and the @xmath43 ( lower window ) interactions with the experimental data .",
    "the comparison then allows us to estimate the required density of the fragment emitting source . at the respectively low temperatures reached in the peripheral reactions at tamu and gsi ,",
    "the calculated results indicate that the fragments are emitted from sources at densities only slightly below @xmath3 . in the peripheral reactions ,",
    "either the projectile - like or target - like residue is only slightly excited with little expansion . while at the higher temperatures reached in the more central reactions , the fragments are emitted from significantly diluted sources with densities depending on the interaction used .",
    "this picture is consistent with dynamical model calculations of nuclear multifragmentations in the energy range considered .",
    "more interestingly , it is seen that the experimentally observed evolution of the symmetry energy is mainly due to the change in density rather than temperature . around the typical freeze - out temperatures reached in both the tamu and the gsi experiments ,",
    "the evolution of the symmetry energy due to the change in temperature at a given density is rather small .",
    "it implies that the underlying origin of the observed decrease of the symmetry energy with the apparently increasing temperature or centrality in these experiments is actually due to the accompanying decrease in freeze - out density .",
    "comparing the two sets of data , it is seen that they actually parallel with each other in the common density range .",
    "since the evolution of the symmetry energy is essentially independent of the temperature for the experiments considered , the two sets of date thus indicate the same density - dependence of the symmetry energy as one expects . on the other hand , within the view that the extracted @xmath55 reflects the symmetry energy of the fragments at freeze - out ,",
    "the two data sets are incompatible .    from the above discussions",
    ", we can see that the evolution of the symmetry energy can be useful in exploring the density dependence of the interaction part of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the latter is most uncertain but very important for many interesting questions in astrophysics . with the interaction labeled @xmath45 ,",
    "the hottest point requires an average freeze - out density of about @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the tamu - sjy and the indra@gsi data , respectively . while using the interaction labeled @xmath43 , the corresponding average freeze - out density is about @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the required freeze - out density depends strongly on the interaction part of the symmetry energy .",
    "the effect of using interactions of @xmath45 and @xmath43 is about @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the tamu and the indra@gsi experiment , respectively .",
    "of course , for the purpose of extracting the interaction part of the symmetry energy from the isoscaling analyses , it is necessary to know not only the freeze - out temperature but also the density when the fragments are emitted from the reactions .",
    "fortunately , inferring both the freeze - out temperature and density in isoscaling analyses has been shown feasible very recently by the tamu - jbn group @xcite , albeit largely based on model calculations .",
    "since an independent determination of the freeze - out density will be very useful , observables known to be sensitive to the freeze - out density , such as the fragment correlation functions@xcite or source functions from imaging techniques@xcite , may be explored together with the isoscaling analyses .",
    "in summary , within the degenerate fermi gas model of mekjian , lee and zamick it is shown that the experimentally observed evolution of the symmetry energy can be well understood .",
    "furthermore , the evolution is found to be mainly due to the variation in the freeze - out density rather than temperature in the reactions carried out under different conditions .",
    "the isoscaling analyses are thus useful for probing the interaction part of the nuclear symmetry energy , provided that both the freeze - out temperature and density can also be inferred .",
