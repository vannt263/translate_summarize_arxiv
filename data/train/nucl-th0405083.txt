    "the model is the same as the copenhagen or berlin model .",
    "we therefore embarked upon calculating the multiplicity distributions in the thermodynamic model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",

    "sect.[section : multiplicity ] is devoted to the multiplicity distributions of single or a range of intermediate sized clusters in one and two component model . since decay and feeding process could also affect the multiplicity distributions detected in experiments , we also discussed them in the same section .",

    "the thermodynamic model has been described in many places @xcite . for completeness , to enumerate the parameters and the techniques needed to calculate the multiplicity distributions , we provide some details .",

    "is done next and follows the procedures given in @xcite .",
    "if there are @xmath7 identical particles of only one kind in an enclosure at temperature @xmath8 , the partition function of the system can be written as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the partition function of one particle . for a spinless particle",
    "this is @xmath11 ; @xmath1 is the mass of the particle ; @xmath12 is the available volume within which each particle moves ; @xmath13 corrects for gibb s paradox .",

    "the multiplicity distribution of intermediate sized clusters ( 6 - 40 ) is our primary interest , because these clusters are abundantly produced and are believed to be directly produced from multifragmentation process @xcite .",
    "lighter clusters have multiple origins .",
    "heavier clusters are often less abundant and more difficult to identify in experiments @xcite .",
    "the essential features for multiplicity distribution is already present in a single component model , and we will start from this model first .",
    "we are interested in the multiplicity distribution of single sized clusters as well as the multiplicity distribution of a range of clusters .    as is well known , the current canonical model exhibits features of a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the divergence in the specific heat at the phase transition temperature is replaced by a finite peak due to finite system size effect , and the phase transition temperature @xmath61 is shifted to a lower value @xcite .",
    "the specific heat per particle is plotted as a function of system size in fig.[fig : comp1:cv - peak ] .",
    "the temperature at which the specific heat is maximum is called phase transition temperature @xmath61 for the finite system . as will be shown later ,",
    "some of the fragmentation characteristics change as the temperature of the fragmentation source changes from below phase transition temperature @xmath62 to above phase transition temperature @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the phase transition temperature provides a natural temperature scale for the fragmentation process in the current model .     as a function of temperature for a system of total mass @xmath64 .",
    "the density of the fragmentation source is fixed at @xmath65 .",
    "the peak at @xmath66 mev is defined as the phase transition temperature @xmath61 in the current one component canonical model . ]",
    "fig.[fig : comp1:mdist - singles ] shows the multiplicity distribution of a single cluster with mass @xmath67 , at three different temperatures @xmath62 , @xmath68 , and @xmath63 .",
    "one of the most striking features in fig.[fig : comp1:mdist - singles ] is that the probability of high multiplicity event is exponentially small .",
    "the poisson distribution with same mean as the corresponding canonical distribution can be compared with the canonical results . in the linear scale used in fig.[fig : comp1:mdist - singles ] , it is quite difficult to see any difference between the poisson distribution and the canonical results for multiplicity distribution .",
    "we have tried to fit the canonical result with either a poisson distribution or a binomial distribution as suggested by merotto _",
    "@xcite , the fit is always very good .",
    "the reason for a good fit is easy to understand .",
    "the canonical results for multiplicity distribution have practically only a few relevant terms , probability for all high multiplicity events are exponentially small . so the fitting essentially only need to fit the first few terms of the multiplicity distribution , and the higher multiplicity terms are just too small to affect the fit .",
    "in such fitting , the condition probability distribution sums up to unity is automatically satisfied by the fit distributions .    in the case of @xmath69 mev in fig.[fig : comp1:mdist - singles ] , we can safely neglect terms with @xmath70 , and we are left with only two significant terms in the distribution .",
    "then it is not a surprise to see a good fit with poisson distribution .",
    "since poisson distribution has only one parameter , could fit well the canonical result , we will hereafter only compare the results of the canonical model with the poisson distribution .",
    "even at @xmath71 mev , the multiplicity distribution of a single cluster @xmath67 is well fitted by a simple poisson distribution . and",
    "this result holds for effectively all small clusters as long as the system size is considerably larger than the cluster we are interested in .",
    "this seemingly simple distribution has been the subject of various interpretations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the good fit with a simple poisson distribution is not a coincidence . in a grand canonical model for multifragmentation process",
    ", the single cluster multiplicity distribution is always a poisson distribution .",
    "the total particle number is not conserved in the grand canonical case , and a production of a certain cluster does not affect the yield of a second similar cluster at all @xcite . and each of these processes are simply combined with a factorial factor accounting for statistics , which then yield the poisson distribution . for a canonical result to yield a poisson distribution , we need to require small probability for single cluster formation , so that formation of the first cluster will not significantly affect the formation of a second same cluster .",
    "this condition is fulfilled when the cluster is much smaller than the entire fragmentation source , and there are many similar channels for particles to go into beside the one we are interested . in other words ,",
    "the clusters in the low multiplicity events are effectively produced independently and little correlation exists between them .",
    "such independent production mechanism together with the factorial factor for statistics always yields a near poisson distribution .     of a single cluster with mass @xmath67 as a function of multiplicity of this cluster @xmath72 in one component canonical model .",

    ", the canonical results are shown with square symbols and the poisson distribution with the same mean is shown with solid line .",
    "it is clear that canonical result for a single cluster follows closely poisson distribution , except at large multiplicities .",
    "however , significant difference shows up at large multiplicities . there is a change of super - poissonian distribution to sub - poissonian distribution when temperature changes from below phase transition temperature to above phase transition temperature . ]    despite the good fit with a poisson distribution , there are still significant differences in the canonical results and the poisson distributions .",
    "if we look at the fine details of the multiplicity distribution and the poisson distribution , we find the tails of the distributions differ considerably . in the log plot of the multiplicity distributions ,",
    "fig.[fig : comp1:mdist - singles - log - pstest ] , the canonical results show systematic deviation from the poisson distribution . at below phase transition temperatures ,",
    "the tail of the canonical result is significantly larger than the corresponding poisson distribution with the same mean .",
    "such a trend reverses at temperature above the phase transition temperature .",
    "right at phase transition temperature , @xmath78 , the distribution follows very closely the corresponding poisson distribution .    at below @xmath61 ,",
    "the system is in liquid - gas coexistence phase .",
    "the particles in the system could either choose to reside in the the small clusters ( gas phase ) or in the large clusters ( liquid phase ) , and thus incur large fluctuations in the distribution .",
    "above phase transition temperature , @xmath63 , the system is in gas phase .",
    "the particles are partitioned only in small clusters .",
    "the width of the multiplicity distribution should be reduced due to finite system size constraint . at phase transition temperature , @xmath78 ,",
    "the different factors compete , and we are left with an almost poisson distribution .",
    "so at the phase transition temperature , different constraints on the multiplicity distribution cancel , the system reaches a critical point .",
    "the small clusters suddenly do not feel the boundary of the system , and form according to the unconstrained distribution , that is , the poisson distribution .     for multiplicity distribution of single clusters , @xmath67 , as a function of multiplicity @xmath72 in one component canonical model .",
    "see eq.([eq : sect3:eq1 ] ) for the definition of @xmath79 . by definition ,",

    "the poisson test parameter shows the difference in the multiplicity distribution as the temperature changes from below to above @xmath61 .",
    "right at around phase transition temperature , the poisson test parameter is most close to unity for a large range of multiplicities . while below and above phase transition temperature",
    ", the poisson test parameter is far than from unity for most multiplicities . ]    to get more quantitative description of the differences between the canonical result and the poisson distribution , it is instructive to define a poisson test parameter @xmath81 where @xmath77 is the probability of the multiplicity @xmath72 event , and @xmath82 is the mean multiplicity .",
    "such a ratio was introduced in @xcite in the discussion of multiplicity distributions . for poisson distribution , this test parameter is always exactly one . for canonical results , this",
    "test parameter scales out the obvious power decay factor , and shows the fine details of deviation from poisson distribution without reference to any artificially constructed poisson distributions .",
    "the poisson test parameter @xmath79 for the canonical results are plotted in fig.[fig : comp1:mdist - singles - pstest ] .",
    "with multiplicity distributions such as obtained for @xmath67 , the deviation from exact poisson distribution is mostly in the high multiplicity tail .",
    "the poisson test parameter reveals the quantitative deviation from poisson distribution and such difference is readily seen at the high multiplicity tail .",
    "when we are dealing with a single sized cluster formed in the fragmentation process , @xmath77 reflects not only the single formation factor associated with the production of such cluster , it also is constrained by the weight factor for phase space of other clusters . with a change of @xmath83 , as we can see from eq.([eq : sect2:eq8 ] ) , the first weight factor related to the formation of the interested cluster changes @xmath84 , and is exactly cancelled by the ratio eq.([eq : sect3:eq1 ] ) ; the second weight factor related to the partition of the rest of the particles in the system also changes , @xmath85 .",
    "when the poisson test parameter @xmath79 is nearly constant for small @xmath72 , we infer that there is a rough scaling in the second partition weight when multiplicity @xmath72 changes .",
    "the second weight factor is just the partition of @xmath86 particles with the condition of not producing the pre - selected cluster @xmath28 . with the understanding that the formation of the pre - selected cluster is",
    "one of the many channels the system could select , ignoring such a channel will not significantly change the total phase space .",
    "then it became clear that the scaling in @xmath87 simple suggests a system size scaling in the total partition function . at",
    "any given temperature , the partition pattern is not expected to change significantly when system size changes by a small number as long as @xmath88 , so that the partition function will scale roughly with the system size .",
    "such a scaling is of course going to break down when the size @xmath86 does not remain large anymore , and thus finite system size effect kicks in .",
    "while the production of a single cluster @xmath28 is only a small fraction of the phase space , the production of a range of clusters is a much more sizable fraction of the phase space , and could reveal the bulk structure of the partition phase space . for single component model ,",

    "but when the imfs are abundantly produced , @xmath92 , the poisson distribution does not describe the canonical result at all .",
    "the narrowing of the imf multiplicity distribution seen at temperatures @xmath93 is significant compared with the multiplicity distribution of a single sized cluster .",
    "such narrow distribution reveals the strong correlations between the imf clusters .",

    ", we should ask why the multiplicity distribution of @xmath112 looks more like that of @xmath110 , as temperature increases . generally , isospin asymmetry in the total system is a small perturbation parameter , so that the total partition function may be expanded in isospin asymmetry , where the coefficient in front of isospin asymmetry will behave like an effective control parameter .",
    "the effect of such control parameter , in general , will get reduced at higher temperatures , so that the isospin difference between @xmath112 and @xmath110 became less important in the partition problem .    in the one component model",
