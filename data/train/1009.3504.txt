    "a major focus in observational astronomy in recent years has been the study of changes in the intrinsic properties of galaxies ( i.e. , absolute luminosity , stellar mass , star formation rate , radial size etc . ) with look - back time .",
    "this requires redshifts to a large number of galaxies detected to deep flux levels .",
    "such galaxy surveys have recently become possible with the advent of sensitive panoramic detectors with large field of view , capable of detecting the faintest objects .",
    "this hints toward the need for techniques to measure accurate redshifts to a large number of faint galaxies . the most accurate and convincing way to do",
    "this is by performing spectroscopic observations .",
    "however , constructing galaxy surveys based on spectroscopic redshifts is severely limited by the large number of galaxies for which redshifts are needed , by their flux limit , and partly by the absence of emission lines in optical spectra ( i.e. , the redshift desert , @xmath11 ) . as a result , spectroscopic surveys are biased against fainter galaxies , suffer from the spectroscopic selection effects ( i.e. , whether the spectroscopic sample is magnitude , color or surface brightness limited ) and , over a range of redshifts , the method fails when the observed spectral lines from the targets are contaminated by sky emission lines ( i.e. , redshift desert ) . to avoid the above problems , we exploit photometric redshift techniques , allowing us to measure redshifts to large number of galaxies to very faint flux levels , with a relatively modest investment in observing time .    in recent years",
    ", photometric redshifts have played a pivotal role in studying different aspects of galaxy evolution .",
    "this includes studies of the evolution , with look - back time , of the luminosity function ( dahlen et al .",
    "2005 ) , mass function ( ilbert et al .",
    "2010 ) , star formation rate ( gabasch et al .",
    "2004 ; dahlen et al .",
    "2007 ) the large - scale structure ( scoville et al . 2007 ) in the universe , and in identifying high - redshift candidates ( steidel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , they are used in selecting sources for follow - up spectroscopic observations , in confirming spectroscopic redshifts that are only based on a single line ( lilly et al .",
    "2009 ) , and in identifying high - redshift galaxy clusters ( adami et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the photometric redshift techniques can be divided into two broad categories , based on template fitting ( e.g. , hyperz ( bolzonella et al . 2000 ) ; bpz ( bentez 2000 ) ; impz ( babbedge et al . 2004 ) ; zebra ( feldmann et al .",

    "2010 ) ; `` empirical-@xmath12 '' ( wolf 2009 ) ; `` random forests '' ( carliles et al . 2010 ) ) . in the former method , a set of observed or synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds )",
    "is used to predict the expected magnitudes and colors of the objects of interest at different redshifts .",
    "these are then compared with the observed seds of galaxies and their respective redshifts , corresponding to the best - fitting solution , are estimated via @xmath12 minimization .",
    "the latter technique uses a training set of galaxies with known redshifts to derive a relation between the observed fluxes and spectroscopic redshifts and then applies this to the objects without spectroscopic redshifts to deriving their photometric redshifts .",
    "no template seds are required in this method , but a large spectroscopic sample is needed for `` training '' purposes . recently ,",
    "`` hybrid '' codes have also been developed which are able to train template seds ( e.g. , ilbert et al .",
    "2006 ) . for comparisons between different publicly available codes ,",
    "see abdalla et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and hildebrandt et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "the accuracy of photometric redshifts depends , to a large extent , on the spectral coverage and resolution ( number of available photometric bands ) of the seds of galaxies in question .",
    "the main source of uncertainty is the photometric errors , especially at faint magnitudes where the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is low ( dahlen et al . 2008 ) .",
    "also , in multi - waveband surveys , magnitudes are measured with different telescopes and instruments .",
    "differences in the point - spread functions ( psfs ) , corresponding to different instrument and seeing conditions lead to fluxes measured over different physical areas of a galaxy , compromising the accuracy of their seds . furthermore , in constructing multi - waveband catalogs , using data with very different psfs , we face the blending problem , where images taken with instruments with broader psfs or bad seeing conditions merge and hence , making photometry ( and in some cases even source identification ) difficult .    in this paper",
    "we measure photometric redshifts for galaxies in the great observatories origins deep survey southern field ( goods - s ) .",
    "there are a number of major improvements here compared to previous measurements .",
    "firstly , the photometric redshifts are estimated for a catalog selected in advance camera for surveys ( acs ) @xmath7  band .",
    "this has the highest spatial resolution ( @xmath13 0.03 arcsec ) and is significantly deeper than previous catalogs .",
    "secondly , the photometry is performed using the new template fitting ( tfit ; laidler et al .",
    "2007 ) technique where high - resolution images are matched to images with significantly lower resolution .",
    "this reduces photometric uncertainties due to blending and provides consistent photometry in all the passbands regardless of the psf size .",

    ", we show the s / n=5 limiting magnitudes for point sources together with the bandpasses for the 12 filters used in this investigation .",
    "maximum transmission is normalized to unity in each filter .      given the various data set we have , the main challenge in performing the photometry is to generate a multi - waveband catalog with consistent photometry , using data with vastly different pixel scales ( from 0.03 arcsec ( acs ) to 0.6 arcsec ( irac ) ) and psfs ( @xmath130.1 arcsec to @xmath132 arcsec ) .",

    "images are thereafter smoothed to a common psf .",
    "we then create a @xmath7-band - selected catalog with magnitudes from the four acs and three isaac bands , derived using sextractor in `` dual image mode '' .",

    "no other matching criteria were used in the counterpart matching . however ,",
    "if two or more spectroscopic redshift measurements were available from the literature for a given acs galaxy , several considerations were used to decide which value would be adopted , or whether the object would be discarded from the photometric redshift comparisons altogether .",
    "first , most of the spectroscopic surveys attach a set of quality flags to their redshift measurements , indicating their nominal level of reliability .",
    "we remapped these different quality flag systems to a single three - level scale .",

    "the remapping for other surveys was somewhat subjective , but in any case , as we will describe below , objects with contentious redshift measurements were excluded from the photometric redshift .",
    "the quality flags only indicate the reported quality of the redshift measurements , and not the reliability of the matching to the counterparts in the photometric catalog .",
    "after remapping , the quality flags were compared for cases with multiple redshift observations , and the measurement with the highest quality was adopted .",
    "if more than one survey yielded a match with equal quality flag values , these were chosen according to an order of precedence based on previous experience concerning the overall reliability of the redshift data . in the end ,",

    "this leaves a sample of 1403 objects with spectroscopic redshifts used for such comparisons .",

    "we require @xmath363 , i.e. , a detection or an upper limit in at least three filters , in order to calculate photometric redshifts .",

    "given the shape of a schechter luminosity function , this works as an exponential cutoff at bright magnitudes .",
    "taking into account the brightening of @xmath42  with redshift , we use a cutoff that gets 1.7 mag brighter from @xmath43  to @xmath44 and thereafter stays constant . at faint limits , @xmath45 , we assume that all absolute magnitudes are equally probable .",

    "also , possible zero - point errors in the photometry introduce systematics that may bias results . finally , if the estimated photometric errors are too small ( or large ) , the weighting by the error in equation ( 1 ) may bias the fit toward ( away from ) some of the filters , which may also cause systematic effects . however , with a large number of spectroscopic redshifts available , it is possible to correct for some of these biases . for example , ilbert et al .",

    "we therefore believe that the object is a star and that the non - zero redshift may be due to a close companion .",
    "besides these three objects , there are also five objects with @xmath57=0 , but with colors in the color  color diagram that are outside the stellar sequence in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "three of these objects have non - points source morphologies , inconsistent with being stars . for one object",
    "there is , however , a nearby star ( @xmath132 arcsec ) , suggesting a possible error in the catalog matching . for the remaining two non - point source objects ,",
    "the morphologies and colors suggest that the spectroscopic redshifts are probably wrong .",
    "finally , two objects with @xmath60  and point source morphologies fall outside the selection criterion .",
    "these objects are the ones that are closest to the dashed line in figure [ fig5 ] ( distance in magnitude @xmath61=0.08 and 0.17 ) and should therefore be consistent with the star selection used considering the photometric errors .",
    "we could have relaxed the selection to include these objects by shifting the line to redder ( @xmath59ch1 ) colors . however , that leads to an increased risk of flagging a larger number of `` non - stellar '' objects in our final catalog . in the results section ,",
    "we give the total number of objects that are flagged as stars .",
    "after safely excluding the three non - point source objects as not being stars , we note that our color  color selection criterion correctly selects 123 of the remaining 125 objects .",
    "while we can flag stars using color  color selections , this is not the case for the qsos .",
    "we could , in principle , also include a set of templates covering different types of qsos and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in our spectral template library .",
    "however , this will lead to increased risk of degeneracy when fitting normal galaxies without agn contribution , resulting in an increased fraction of outliers .",
    "we therefore do not include additional templates to account for these sed types .",

    "this includes correcting for : ( 1 ) zero - point offsets in the photometry ; ( 2 ) systematic biases in the photometric errors ; ( 3 ) template sed deviations from observed seds ; and ( 4 ) dependence of the template seds on redshift . in the first step ,",
    "we use the goodz code and find the best - fit template for each galaxy after fixing the redshift to its known spectroscopic redshift . from this fit , we calculate the flux of the best - fitting sed in each observed filter . this flux is thereafter compared with the observed flux .",
    "deviations between the template and observed flux can be attributed to flux errors in the observed flux , zero - point errors , calibration errors , insufficient knowledge of the filter response functions and deviations in the shape of the template seds from the `` true '' seds . for a single comparison , it is of course not possible to determine which of these effects are in play . however , with sufficiently large sample of spectroscopic redshifts , an iterative approach can be applied to estimate the contributions from different parts , as discussed below .      to determine if there are any biases in the observed fluxes , for each filter , we plot in figure [ fig6 ] the histogram of the magnitude differences between the observed photometry and that predicted by the best - fitting sed template .",
    "any significant offset in the median of this distribution is likely to be due to a zero - point problem , deviations between the template seds and observed fluxes , or possible contributions from other effects such as incorrect aperture corrections . for this comparison ,",
    "we use objects with spectroscopic redshifts of quality 1 and 2 . even though there may be a few incorrect redshifts in the latter category , by using the median as a measurement of the shift",
    ", the effect of such objects would not be significant .    in figure [ fig6 ]",
    ", we show the offsets for all filters before any corrections as gray histograms ( note the different scaling on the @xmath62-axis for the irac bands ) . for clarity",
    "we show the offsets in magnitude space , even though the actual fitting is done in flux space .",
    "positive offsets in the figure indicate that the measured fluxes are brighter than the template fluxes .",
    "there are definitely biases in the observed fluxes .",
    "the offsets for the @xmath0  band and acs bands are relatively small ( at most @xmath130.05 mag in the @xmath18  band ) , increasing somewhat for the isaac bands and irac ch1 and ch2 ( @xmath130.1 mag ) .",
    "significant offsets are noted in irac ch3 and ch4 where fluxes are @xmath130.30.5 mag too bright compared to the templates .",
    "there is a systematic offset between the instruments , particularly isaac and irac , indicating that there may be a problem when directly comparing fluxes from different instruments where e.g. , pixel scales and psfs differ .",
    "however , the relatively large offsets in irac ch3 and ch4 may partly be due to dust emission in the mir regime not accounted for in the template seds .",
    "we discuss this further in section 3.2.3    as a first step in optimizing the photometric redshifts , we correct the flux in each filter by the median offsets in the distributions shown by the gray histograms in figure [ fig6 ] and in table [ table1 ] .",
    "after this first correction , we recalculate the offsets and find that the median shifts have mostly disappeared after applying a zero - point correction to the flux . for the optical , the nir bands , and irac ch1 and ch2",
    "the median shift is typically 0.01 , while for the irac bands ch3 and ch4 the shifts are @xmath630.020.04 .      to account for systematic errors not included in the statistical flux errors assigned , we add , in quadrature , 0.05 mag in the optical bands , 0.1 mag in the isaac bands , and 0.20 mag in the irac channels to the existing statistical errors ( corresponding to 5% , 10% , and 20% additional flux errors , respectively ) . these `` smoothing '' errors",
    "are further discussed in the appendix .",
    "next , we use the offsets between the observed fluxes and those predicted from template sed fluxes , after applying the offsets calculated above , to investigate rest - wavelength dependent systematics . for each photometric point , we plot in figure [ fig7 ] the offset at the rest - frame wavelength : @xmath64 where @xmath65  is the effective wavelength of the filter for which the offset is calculated and @xmath57  is the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the offsets are shown separately for the six different template seds used . in each panel",
    ", we also plot the median offset , which at each point is calculated using 100 measurements .",
    "the median is plotted to @xmath66 m ( @xmath67 m for sb galaxies ) , at longer wavelengths there are too few data points to derive the median .",
    "both from the measurements themselves and the median , it is clear that there are systematic offsets between the template seds and the actual measured photometry .",
    "this effect is most evident at long wavelengths @xmath68 m .",
    "we note that the templates we have adopted are extended to mir wavelengths , as described in bolzonella et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but that they do not include emission from dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . as an initial precaution",
    ", we have not included irac ch4 in the photometric fitting at @xmath69 since here this filter may be affected by the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature at rest frame @xmath70 m .",
    "this means that only rest - frame wavelengths @xmath636.5@xmath6 m are used in the fitting .",
    "however , the results in figure [ fig7 ] show that , in particular for the later type galaxies , the observed fluxes at long wavelengths are brighter than the template fluxes . since late - type galaxies are more likely to have a significant contribution from dust emission , the trends seen in figure [ fig7 ] are consistent with an underestimate of the true galaxy flux in the mir caused by the lack of dust emission in the templates .",
    "the particular features affecting the photometry at the wavelengths @xmath71 m include the pah features at 3.3@xmath6 m and 6.2@xmath6 m .",
    "for the starburst templates , the underestimate of the galaxy flux starts at somewhat shorter wavelengths , @xmath72 m , indicating that these templates may be under representing the flux already at nir wavelengths .",
    "note that a similar trend is seen by brammer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who find a large offset between observed and template fluxes at mir wavelengths and also a significant offset at nir wavelengths .    to account for the differences between the",
    "observed and template fluxes , we construct a new set of template seds where we correct the original seds using the measured median offsets versus wavelength shown in figure [ fig7 ] . at long wavelengths , @xmath73 m to 6.5@xmath6 m",
    ", we assume that the corrections are constant with a value given by the last measured median data point for each template . note",
    "that this procedure makes the choice of input set of template seds less important .",
    "if we had started with a different template set , the corrections would have made the result similar to what found here . for a detailed description on how to reconstruct galaxy template seds using observed photometry of a spectroscopic sample , see budavri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "having corrected the fluxes for median offsets between observed and template fluxes ( section 3.2.1 ) and optimized the template seds ( section 3.2.3 ) , we now consider redshift dependences . in figure",
    "[ fig8 ] , we plot the offset between observed and template fluxes as a function of redshift .",
    "since we include offsets from all available filters for each object , we expect the median offset to be close to zero .",
    "the plot verifies this where the median is shown to be near zero at all redshifts .",
    "more interestingly , we also study the evolution of the rms between template and observed fluxes . in a scenario",
    "were the true seds of galaxies evolve with redshift and are no longer represented by the template set used in the fitting , we expect the rms , shown as the upper curve in figure [ fig8 ] , to increase with redshift .",
    "there is a weak trend of an increasing rms with redshift by  0.07 mag over the redshift range investigated .",
    "however , at the same time we note that the statistical photometric errors increase from a mean 0.06 mag at @xmath74  to a mean 0.12 mag at @xmath75 , which is consistent with the increase in rms between the observed photometry and the template seds .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no significant indication of a redshift evolution in the seds of the observed galaxies that is not represented in the templates used .",
    "there is possibly an indication of an increased scatter at redshifts @xmath76 .",
    "however , at these redshifts the lyman break becomes the most important feature for determining photometric redshifts .",
    "since this feature is independent of galaxy type , deviations between the true galaxy seds and the template seds used in the fitting become less important .",
    "note that at redshifts @xmath77 , the statistics are too poor to extend this investigation .",
    "based on the results from this study , we do not consider any redshift - dependent corrections to the library of template seds .",
    "next , we recalculate the zero - point offsets after having applied the corrections from steps 1 and 3 above .",
    "the additional offsets are typically @xmath130.01 mag for the @xmath0 , acs and isaac bands and @xmath130.02 for the irac bands .      as a final step ,",

    "we rerun the photometric redshift code after adding additional offsets corresponding to @xmath780.01 mag to the fluxes in each band .",
    "after a first run through all filters , we keep the offsets that result in a decrease in the scatter between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts compared to the case with no additional offsets .",
    "we thereafter make a second iteration adding @xmath780.01 mag to the already derived offsets .",
    "the iterations are repeated until no improvement in the scatter is achieved .",
    "the additional shifts resulting from this training do not exceed 0.05 mag in any of the bands , except irac ch4 where the offset is 0.08 mag .",
    "the black curves in figure [ fig6 ] show the resulting offset between the observed and the template magnitudes in each filter after applying magnitude shifts and using the corrected template seds .",
    "the figure shows that the offsets have been corrected and that the widths of the distributions have narrowed ( higher peaks ) .",
    "note that the shifts we have applied ( table [ table1 ] ) were derived to optimize the photometric redshifts , which does not necessarily indicate that the photometry in the goods - s catalogs are affected by the same offsets .",
    "this is because there are many possible sources contributing to the offsets besides pure zero - point errors , including template mismatches , aperture corrections , errors in filter functions , etc .",
    "therefore , we recommend that these offsets be not applied to the goods - s photometry for other purposes than when deriving photometric redshifts .",

    "even though the statistics are relatively small , these results indicate that there may be increased uncertainties when calculating photometric redshifts in this redshift range .",
    "we finally note that before making any corrections to the magnitudes or templates , the scatter was @xmath82=0.044 and @xmath82=0.045 for the two selections ( with 2.9% and 4.0% outliers , respectively ) .",
    "this shows that the scatter and the fraction of outliers decreased as a result of the process described above .",
    "as noted above , the template set we use does not initially include the contribution due to dust emission in the ism . using the method described in section 3.2.3 , we adjust the template seds to account for differences between the observed flux and the template flux . for late - type galaxies , these corrections are consistent with dust emission at @xmath98 m .",
    "when deriving the photometric redshifts , we make use of the corrected template seds , allowing us to include the irac bands in the photometric redshift fitting .",
    "however , to further examine the effect of dust emission , we also calculate the photometric redshifts where we include the mid - infrared bands in the sed fitting process only when they probe rest - frame wavelengths @xmath99 m .",
    "this explicitly excludes the contribution due to dust when fitting the seds . here , after recalculating the filter offsets as presented in table [ table1 ] , we find that they mostly disappear for ch3 and ch4 , suggesting that these offsets are indeed caused by mir dust emission .",
    "however , this does not improve the accuracy of the photometric redshifts as measured in the last sections , with the scatter between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts remaining the same .",
    "finally , we examine the effects of dust on the photometric redshifts by adding dust emission to our templates using the seds from ilbert et al ( 2009 ) , which have incorporated dust emission at mir wavelengths .",
    "we do , however , note that the inclusion of dust emission features to the template seds , and accurate modeling of it for different spectral types of galaxies is difficult and uncertain . moreover , the pah features are also sensitive to metallicity of their host galaxy ( calzetti et al .",
    "2007 ) , making reliable interpretation of these difficult .",

    "nevertheless , when using these templates , the observed offset is reduced but , again , the errors in the estimated photometric redshifts remain the same as before .    given that none of the above procedures improve the accuracy of our estimated photometric redshifts , we choose not to include the dust into our original template seds . instead , we rely on the method described in section 3.2.3 to correct our templates to account for dust emission .",
    "the reddening applied to the template seds in the photometric redshift fitting lies in the range @xmath100 . to investigate",
    "if the width of the allowed range affects results , we have also run the goodz code after expanding the range by a factor 3 to @xmath101 .",
    "we find no significant differences when expanding the range and therefore conclude that the range used is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "when determining the scatter between the spectroscopic and the photometric redshifts , the result will depend on the characteristics of the spectroscopic sample , i.e. , redshift , magnitude , and color distributions . to examine how the results depend on these properties , we divide our sample in both redshift , magnitude , and color space . in figure [ fig10",

    "the figure shows that the scatter is fairly independent of magnitude while the fraction of outliers shows an increase at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the increase in outlier fraction is expected since fainter objects in general have higher spectroscopic redshifts and have larger photometric errors , which increases the risk for misidentifications of spectral features , leading to catastrophic redshifts .",
    "next , we investigate the scatter versus redshift behavior by dividing our spectroscopic sample into redshift bins using a magnitude limit @xmath104",

    "however , in the higher redshift bins , the scatter is reduced to the same level as at low redshifts .",
    "this is due to shifting of the lyman break feature into our observed passbands , making it easily detectable at these high redshifts .",
    "horizontal error bars in the figure represent the bin - sizes .",
    "the fraction of outliers , shown by the histogram and scaling on right - hand side @xmath102-axis , increases with redshift .",

    "there is a strong color magnitude trend in the spectroscopic sample where the faintest galaxies are predominantly the bluest .",
    "black dots in figure [ fig12 ] show the scatter as a function of rest - frame ( @xmath106 ) color for galaxies with @xmath104 .",
    "the figure indicates that the photometric redshift accuracy do not depend strongly on galaxy color .",
    "even though one may expect a higher scatter for later types or bluer colors do to the less pronounced 4000   break in these galaxies , this is not evident from the figure .",
    "one should , however , note that the spectroscopic sample includes relatively more blue galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "since the accuracy of the photometric redshifts increases at high redshifts once it is possible to detect the lyman break , this helps the determination of the photometric redshifts for the population of blue galaxies .    to investigate if there is a redshift - color bias between the spectroscopic redshift sample and the photometric redshift sample , we calculate the fraction of galaxies of different spectral types that have redshifts below and above @xmath44 , i.e. , the redshift where the bluest filter ( @xmath0  band ) starts to probe the redshifted lyman - break . for the @xmath107  subsample , we find that the spectroscopic sample ( @xmath108=1140 ) consists of 13.1% early - types , 38.0% late - type spirals , and 48.9% starbursts . for the photometric redshift sample ( @xmath109=4798 )",

    "we conclude that there is a trend of an increased fraction of starburst galaxies at higher redshift , but that there is no apparent bias in the fraction of spectral types between the spectroscopic redshift sample and the photometric redshift catalog . in this example , we assign a starburst type to galaxies with ( @xmath106)@xmath1100.34 and an early type for galaxies with ( @xmath106)@xmath230.66 , while intermediate color galaxies are called late - types .",
    "note , however , that highly obscured star - forming galaxies may be assigned an early galaxy type by this one color classification .",

    "the only pronounced color trend in the figure is the higher fraction of outliers at the bluest colors . inspecting this population ,",
    "we find that 89% of the outliers have z@xmath111 , indicating that a misidentification between the lyman break and the 4000   break contributes to the higher outlier fraction at the bluest colors .",

    "for the peak photometric redshift , @xmath54 , the corresponding numbers are @xmath82=0.043 ( both selections ) with 3.9% and 2.2% outliers .",

    "there are also a total of 464 objects with point source morphologies according to our selection criteria described in the next section .",
    "about 57% of these objects ( 264 ) have colors consistent with being stars .",
    "the template set we use does not include specific templates for x - ray sources like qsos and agns .",

    ", we find that 91 non - stellar objects have x - ray detection ( for the full magnitude range the number of matched objects is 136 ) .",
    "deriving the scatter when including the x - ray sources does not increase the scatter ( @xmath82=0.039 ) , however , the fraction of outliers increases from 2.1% to 2.9% when including x - ray sources .",
    "the scatter of the x - ray subsample alone is @xmath82=0.048 after excluding 13.2% outliers .",
    "this shows that the template set used here , also fits the seds for x - ray detected galaxies reasonably well .",
    "however , the fraction of outliers is higher for the x - ray sample , with 12 out of the 91 x - ray sources being outliers .",
    "this means that even though only @xmath138% of the objects with spectroscopic redshifts have x - ray flux , @xmath1334% of the outliers belong to this category .",
    "the cdf - s x - ray catalog by alexander et al . ( 2003 ) contains a total of 326 sources , of which @xmath13270 are inside the area covered by the goods - s acs-@xmath7-selected catalog . matching these x - ray sources with the goods - s catalog results in 200 matches , where we require a distance @xmath1101.5 arcsec for a successful match . of these ,",

    "this means that only @xmath13130 x - ray sources are assigned photometric redshifts ( of a total of @xmath1332500 objects in the goods - s catalog ) and we therefore expect the overall impact of these sources to be small .",
    "we further test the possible impact of objects with seds dominated by qso / agn contribution by including an additional set of template seds also covering agns and qsos when deriving the photometric redshifts . for this purpose ,",
    "we use template seds taken from the swire sed library ( polletta et al . 2007 ) .",
    "our extended template set includes our six original templates and seven additional templates , the latter representing seyfert galaxies , type 1 and type 2 qsos as well as composite agns and starburst galaxies .",
    "the photometric redshifts derived with this extended set of template seds show very similar results as with the original set of seds . for the full spectroscopic sample including the 91 x - ray objects , we find @xmath82=0.039 for both the original template set and the extended template set .",
    "the fraction of outliers is slightly higher for the extended set , 3.2% compared to 2.9% for the original set .",

    "contributing to this is the fact that normal galaxies dominate the goods - s field . the number of x - ray sources for which spectroscopic redshift are not available is also expected to be very small .",

    "they find @xmath122 .",
    "contributing to the success of these photometric redshifts is the large number of available filters ( 35 narrow band , intermediate band and broadband ) and spectroscopic redshifts used to `` train '' the template seds .",
    "while these filters , in particular the narrower bands , mainly cover optical wavelengths , we expect the accuracy of the cosmos photometric redshifts to be best at @xmath1231.5 and at magnitudes where galaxies are detected in most of the available filters . at higher redshifts ( @xmath124 ) , ilbert et al .",

    "the goods - music catalog covers @xmath1393% of the area we cover , while including in total @xmath1357% as many objects ( 18,657 versus 32,508 ) and @xmath1346% as many photometric redshifts ( 14,938 versus 32,505 ) .",
    "contributing to this difference is the use of acs data from release v1.0 in goods - music while we in this investigation use the deeper version 2.0 of the data .",

    "the number of objects included is @xmath1320% as many ( 6308 versus 32,508 ) as in our catalog .",
    "this large difference is mainly due to the isaac @xmath4-band selection used in the fireworks catalog which preferentially selects red ir luminous objects and misses many blue objects detectable in the optical with acs .",
    "the larger fwhm of isaac compared to acs may also merge nearby objects that in an acs - selected catalog are listed as individual sources .",
    "other differences are that fireworks uses acs data version 1.0 ( we use version v2.0 ) and isaac data version 1.5 ( while we use the latest version 2.0 ) .",

    ", this may not hold at fainter limits .",
    "also , the fraction of outliers is expected to increase at fainter magnitudes .      to compare our results from the tfit magnitudes with those based on more `` traditional '' sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) magnitudes ,",
    "we have created an alternative catalog as described in section 2.2 .",
    "we derive photometric redshifts for the sextractor catalog using an aperture with 1.5 arcsec diameter for the @xmath0  band , the acs bands , and the isaac bands . for irac , we use 3 arcsec aperture magnitudes due to the larger psf for these data .",
    "we use the same iterative procedure as described above .",
    "this process will adjust the observed fluxes for necessary aperture corrections introduced by different aperture sizes , by matching fluxes with spectral templates using the sample of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we compare the photometric redshift estimates from the tfit and sextractor catalogs using galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts in common between the two catalogs . the resulting scatter for the sextractor catalog",
    "is @xmath82=0.046 and @xmath82=0.045 for the full sample ( @xmath138=1271 ) and for @xmath1024.5 ( @xmath138=1123 ) , respectively .",
    "for the same selection , using the tfit catalog , we find @xmath86=0.039 and @xmath86=0.038 for the two selections , respectively .",
    "the outlier fractions are 7.2% and 3.9% for the sextractor catalog compared to 3.6% and 2.1% for the tfit catalog .",
    "therefore , both the scatter and the fraction of outliers are higher for the sextractor catalog compared to the tfit catalog .",
    "one important difference between the two catalogs which could contribute to the results is that the tfit method gives an estimate of the flux in all the bands that cover the area as given by the detection in the @xmath7  band , even though in some cases only an upper limit can be derived . for the sextractor catalog",
    ", there is always a detection or an upper limit for the four acs bands and the three isaac bands since the photometry for these bands is derived using sextractor in `` dual image mode '' .",
    "only when a particular filter does not cover the full area of the detection band will there be a non - detection so that the particular filter can not be used in the photometric redshift fitting . for the @xmath0  band and irac channels ,",
    "the situation is different since for these bands we coordinate match objects to the acs @xmath7-band - selected catalog , using a 1 arcsec matching radius .",
    "if there is no match between the @xmath7-band - selected objects and the @xmath0-band / irac catalogs , this could be due to the latter not covering the full area of the detection filter .",
    "however , it could also be that the flux is below the detection limit or blending may have caused absence of a match . since we can not distinguish between the latter two scenarios , we always exclude the non - matching filter in the photometric redshift calculation . to quantify this difference",
    ", we note that 75% of the galaxies in the full spectroscopic sample are detected in equal numbers of filters in both catalogs , while 21% are detected in more filters in the tfit compared to the sextractor catalog .",
    "the remaining 4% are detected in more filters in the sextractor catalog .",
    "note that the spectroscopic sample has a relatively bright magnitude limit , which means that objects are , in most cases , detected in all available filters .",
    "however , at fainter magnitudes we expect objects to be undetected in an increasing number of filters . here",

    "comparing the lbg color selected samples to the overall @xmath7-band - selected population of galaxies with photometric redshifts in the same general range gives an idea of the efficiency and completeness of lbg selection .",
    "in particular , we focus on @xmath18- , @xmath19- , and @xmath20-band dropouts . to select the dropout samples , we use galaxy photometry from the sextractor catalog ( using the publicly available acs-@xmath7-selected version 2.0 catalog ) in order to be consistent with previous works that base color selection criteria on sextractor magnitudes .",

    "there is , however , a small low - redshift secondary peak in the photometric redshift distribution in figure [ fig15 ] centered at @xmath1050.5 , as well as galaxies in the wings of the main peak that falls outside the defined redshift range 2.8@xmath1484.4 .",

    "it is important to note that since the simulations do not extend below @xmath153 , we are not able to quantify how many dropout - selected galaxies would fall in the secondary peak .",

    "we find , respectively , that 18.8% , 21.6% , 20.3% , and 31.0% of the dropout galaxies have photometric redshifts outside the @xmath152  range .",
    "this indicates that the contamination fraction is relatively independent of magnitude except at the very faintest limits where there is an indication of an increase of contaminants .",
    "however , if we look only at the fraction of galaxies in the low - redshift peak ( @xmath74 ) , we find fractions 9.5% , 10.8% , 7.6% , and 4.0% .",
    "this indicates that the overall increase of galaxies outside the range in the faintest bin is not due to a misidentification between the lyman and the balmer breaks , but instead due to a general increase in photometric redshift errors , shifting more galaxies outside the defined redshift range .",
    "besides the contamination fraction , it is important to understand the completeness of the dropout selection , i.e. , what fraction of the total number of galaxies within a defined redshift range is expected to be selected with the dropout criteria .",
    "based on photometric redshifts , we find a total of 3318 galaxies in the range @xmath152 , of which 1646 have colors according to the dropout criteria , suggesting a completeness of @xmath1350% .",
    "using the simulated completeness function , we find that 33% of the simulated galaxies within the redshift range are selected with the @xmath18-band dropout criteria , indicating that the simulations somewhat underestimates the completeness compared to the photometric redshifts .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ fig16 ] , which shows the completeness as a function of redshift for both the photometric redshift selected sample and the simulations .",
    "there is a good agreement between the location and shape of the distributions , however , as noted above the completeness is higher for the photometric redshift sample .",
    "there is of course a direct relation between the contamination fraction and the completeness . choosing a narrower photometric redshift range for the @xmath18-band dropouts will increase the contamination and at the same time",
    "also increase the completeness .",
    "e.g. , adopting the redshift range 3.44@xmath1484.12 , used by giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , we find a contamination fraction of 53% ( compared to 23% when using the wider redshift range ) . at the same time",
    ", the completeness for the narrower redshift range is 76% compared to 50% for the wider range .    to illustrate the dropout selection , we show in figure [ fig17 ] a color  color diagram where the @xmath18-band dropout galaxies reside on the top left part of the plot .",
    "dropout galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath152  are shown as crosses .",
    "triangles outside the region defined by the selection criteria show galaxies within the redshift range that are not selected as dropouts .",
    "we note that these galaxies have a similar ( @xmath155 ) color as the dropout - selected candidates and have a median ( @xmath106 ) color that is @xmath130.4 mag bluer than the color selection limits .",
    "we also find that of the total number of galaxies in the redshift range",
    "@xmath152 , not selected by the @xmath18-band dropout criteria , less than 2% ( 25 of 1672 ) are selected as @xmath19-band dropouts in the range @xmath156  ( selection discussed below ) .",
    "finally , @xmath157 of the dropout - selected galaxies that were found to have photometric redshifts outside the above range are shown as filled circles inside the dropout selection criteria region in figure [ fig17 ] .",
    "as expected , most of these are close to the selection boundary .    previously , popesso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have estimated that the @xmath18-band selection criteria from giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2004b ) results in a completeness of @xmath1380% , in good agreement with the 76% found here for the same selection .",

    "( 2009 ) estimate that dropout methods would miss @xmath1380% of the @xmath1583.5 galaxies .",
    "the reason for this high incompleteness is that the majority of the @xmath5  selected @xmath1583.5 galaxies are too faint to be detected in the optical passbands and therefore , are absent from the dropout catalogs .",
    "it should be noted that a relative good agreement between the photometric redshifts and dropout selection is expected since both methods use colors to locate the lyman break and from this derive the redshift .",
    "the main difference is that the dropout technique uses the optical bands only , while the photometric redshift method also uses available nir and mir data to constrain the overall shape of the galaxies seds . to quantify this",
    ", we find that of the @xmath18-band dropout - selected galaxies , 56% are detected in both isaac and irac , while an additional 34% are detected in either isaac or irac , leaving only 10% of the dropout galaxies without ir detection .",
    "the @xmath19-band dropout selection criterion is based on a shorter wavelength baseline , only using an upper limit for the @xmath18  band .",
