    "besides uranium and plutonium , thorium is also one kind of important nuclear materials .",
    "metal thorium and its compounds have been widely investigated both experimentally and theoretically since metal thorium was found in 1828 . among thorium compounds , thorium dioxide tho@xmath0 , which is a stable diamagnetic transparent insulating solid ,",
    "has attracted special attention .",
    "in addition to its usage as an important nuclear fuel material , thorium dioxide has also been used as a solid - state electrolyte . in particular ,",
    "due to its prominent hardness , tho@xmath0 has potential interests as an optical component material and laser host .",
    "recently , there has occurred in the literature a series of experimental reports on pressure - induced phase transition of tho@xmath0 @xcite . at ambient pressure ,",
    "tho@xmath0 crystallizes in the ( caf@xmath0-type ) fluorite structure with space group _",
    "fm@xmath3 m _ ( no .",
    "225 ) . by using the energy dispersive x - ray diffraction ( edxrd ) method , dancausse _",
    "et al_. @xcite reported that at 40 gpa , tho@xmath0 undergo a phase transition to an orthorhombic structure of cotunnite ( pbcl@xmath0 ) type with space group _ pnma _ ( no .",
    "later , through improving experimental measurement technique , idiri _",
    "et al_. @xcite observed that this phase transition really begins around 30 gpa , and the two phases coexist in a wide pressure range of nearly 20 gpa .",
    "additional high - pressure raman spectroscopy measured by jayaraman _ et al_. @xcite also suggested that tho@xmath0 starts to transform into the cotunnite structure around 30 gpa .",
    "in contrast to the above - mentioned extensive experimental investigation , a systematic theoretical study on the phase transition of tho@xmath0 at high pressure is still lacking . in particular , considering the obvious discrepancy between two experimental groups @xcite involving the transition pressure , such a theoretical investigation from basis quantum mechanics is not only complementary but also indispensable .",
    "motivated by this observation , in this paper , we present a first - principles study by calculating the total energies and enthalpies of tho@xmath0 at its experimentally established crystalline phases .",
    "our calculation shows that the transition pressure is around 30 gpa , consistent with the recent experiment by idiri _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "the other task for this paper is to theoretically present a thorough description of physical , mechanical and chemical bonding properties of tho@xmath0 at its ground state of the fluorite phase . to date , theoretical studies of the ground - state behavior of tho@xmath0 are very scarce in literature @xcite and some of them are even inconsistent with the experimental data to a large extent .",
    "for example , without taking into account the @xmath4 state , kelly _",
    "et al_. @xcite calculated the bulk modulus @xmath5 of tho@xmath0 to be 290 gpa , which is far from the experimental value of 198 gpa . on the other hand , based on a purely ionic model , harding _",
    "et al_. @xcite obtained @xmath5=175 gpa , which , compared to the experimental data , clearly underestimate the binding interaction in the material to a large extent .",
    "this as whole encourages us to theoretically report a systematic investigation on the ground - state properties of tho@xmath0 at its ambient phase .",
    "besides the consistency with the existing experimental data , we expect that the new results for the first time predicted in this paper and experimentally inaccessible at present , such as the hardness , the phonon spectrum , and the charge transfer of the th - o bond , will be of great help for a primary understanding of tho@xmath0 .",

    "our total energy calculations are carried out by employing the plane - wave basis pseudopotential method as implemented in vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the exchange and correlation effects are described by the dft within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "the electron and core interactions are included using the frozen - core projected augmented wave ( paw ) approach which combines the accuracy of augmented - plane - wave methods with the efficiency of the pseudo - potential approach @xcite .",

    "2s@xmath62p@xmath9 electrons are treated as valence electrons .",
    "note that although the @xmath4 state are empty in elemental th , this level turns to evolve into a hybridization with o @xmath10 state in the valence band , as well as to prominently contributes to the conduction band ( see fig .",
    "3 below ) .",
    "we use a 9@xmath119@xmath119 _ k_-point grid with monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite for fluorite tho@xmath0 and 9@xmath1115@xmath119 _ k_-point grid for cotunnite structure .",
    "electron wave function is expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 500 ev , and all atoms are fully relaxed until the quantum mechanical forces become less than 0.02 ev /  .    to obtain optimized lattice constants of ground state tho@xmath0 , first , we calculate several total energies at different lattice constants around the experimental value .",

    "[ pnmaelastic ] the following prominent features can be seen : ( i ) the orthorhombic tho@xmath0 at zero pressure is mechanically stable because its elastic constants satisfy the following mechanical stability criteria @xcite .",

    "the mechanical stability criteria is easily satisfied ; ( ii ) although the equilibrium volume of cotunnite - type tho@xmath0 is distinctly compressed , its bulk modulus , shear modulus , and young s modulus are all smaller by approximately 25% than those in fluorite - type tho@xmath0 .",
    "this intriguing behavior has also been observed in the uo@xmath0 system @xcite , which , like tho@xmath0 , will undergo a @xmath22 phase transition . since the @xmath4 orbital band is occupied in uo@xmath0 ,",
    "while it is almost empty in tho@xmath0 , thus this similarity of the softening in moduli upon phase transition for the two systems is clearly unrelated with the @xmath4 orbitals . from this aspect , we speculate that most actinide dioxides share this phase - transition involved similarity . again",
    ", we have confirmed for the _ pnma _ phase that the bulk modulus _",
    "b _ calculated by fitting",
    "the murnaghan equation of state equals to that through vrh approximation ; ( iii ) the poisson s ratio @xmath13 of tho@xmath0 in @xmath23 phase is nearly the same as in @xmath24 phase , i.e. , close to 1/3 .",
    "this is understandable since the shear modulus is much smaller than the bulk modulus in the both two phases .",
    "now let us see the phase transition energetics of tho@xmath0 .",
    "the total energies ( per unit cell ) of the two phases at different volumes are calculated and shown in fig .",
    "[ energy ] . obviously ,",
    "the _ fm@xmath3 m _ phase is stable under ambient pressure while under high pressure the _ pnma _ phase becomes stable . according to the rule of common tangent of two energy curves , a phase transition at 26.5 gpa is predicted by the slope shown in the inset of fig . [ energy ] . besides , we also determine the phase transition pressure by comparing the gibbs free energy as a function of pressure . at 0 k , the gibbs free energy is equal to the enthalpy _",

    "the crossing between the two enthalpy curves in fig .",
    "[ enthalpy ] readily gives phase transition pressure of 26.5 gpa , which is fully consistent with the above result in terms of the common tangent rule .",
    "this value is well close to the experiment measurement by idiri _",

    "et al_. @xcite as @xmath2530 gpa . here",
    ", the minor theoretical underestimation by @xmath255.0 gpa is speculated to be caused by the possible existence of an energy barrier with an amplitude of @xmath26 . to overcome this energy barrier , the external pressure @xmath27 should be larger than the conventional common - tangent - rule determined pressure @xmath28 by an amount @xmath29=@xmath30 . according to the experimentally measured transition pressure @xmath27 @xcite and our theoretically obtained common tangent curve in fig .",
    "[ energy ] , we deduce the energy barrier amplitude to be @xmath250.06 ev ( per formula unit ) .",

    "figure [ pressure ] shows the relative volume _",
    "v / v@xmath31 _ evolution with pressure for tho@xmath0 in both _",
    "fm@xmath3 m _ and _ pnma _ phases . for comparison ,",
    "the experimental data are also shown in the figure .",
    "clearly , our calculated p - v equation of state is well consistent with the experimental measurement for the both two phases of tho@xmath0 .",
    "specially , at the calculated transition pressure ( 26.5 gpa ) , our result in fig .",
    "[ pressure ] gives that the volume collapse upon phase transition is 5.9% .",
    "this value is very close to the experimental data of 6.1% @xcite with a little bit underestimation , which is obviously within the accuracy of gga .",
    "note that unlike the cubic _",
    "m _ phase , in which all coordinated are completely determined at each volume due to the symmetry , the orthorhombic _ pnma _ phase at each volume has two additional internal degrees of freedom that must be fully relaxed to obtain the energy minimum .",
    "thus , we have further calculated and plotted in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] the pressure dependence of the three lattice parameters ( with respect to their equilibrium values ) for the _ pnma _ phase of tho@xmath0 . in the experimentally reported pressure range from @xmath2530 gpa to @xmath2580 gpa , our calculated evolution of the relative lattice parameters in the _ pnma _ phase are well consistent with the experimental observation @xcite . in this pressure region , one can see from fig .",
    "[ lattice ] that the responses of the three relative lattice parameters to the compression are anisotropic in the sense that the compression of the middle axis @xmath32 is most rapid compared to those of the long axis @xmath33 and small axis @xmath34 , which vary upon compression almost in the same tendency .",
    "when the pressure becomes higher to be between 80 and 130 gpa , remarkably , it reveals in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] that all the three relative lattice parameters undergo dramatic variations by the fact that the small axis @xmath34 has a strong rebound and the middle @xmath32 is collapsed .",
    "when the pressure is beyond 130 gpa , then the variations of the three relative lattice parameters become smooth and approach isotropic compression .",
    "this signifies a typical isostructural transition for the _ pnma _ phase of tho@xmath0 .",
    "it should be stressed that this isostructural transition is not unique for tho@xmath0 .",
    "similar phenomenon has also been observed in other actinide dioxides @xcite .",
    "m _ phase ( a ) and _ pnma _ phase ( b ) both at 26.5 gpa .",
    "the fermi energy level is zero .",
    "the energy gaps of _",
    "m _ phase and _ pnma _ phase are 4.584 ev and 3.153 ev , respectively . ]    to see the change of electronic structure of tho@xmath0 under high pressure , we present in fig .",
    "[ twodos ] the orbital - resolved pdos for the _",
    "fm@xmath3 m _ and _ pnma _ phases at the theoretical transition pressure of 26.5 gpa .",
    "one can see that there occurs an understandable narrowing in the band gap ( 4.6 ev for the _",
    "fm@xmath3 m _ phase and 3.15 ev for the _ pnma _ phase ) .",
    "the valence and conduction bands carry a sizeable downward shift to stabilize the high - pressure _ pnma _ phase .",
    "in addition , the valence and conduction bands are more widened and smooth in the _ pnma _ phase .",
    "however , these changes in the electronic structure are trivial and thus can not be associated with the exotic transition - accompanied volume collapse in tho@xmath0 and other actinide dioxides . concerning the 5@xmath35 electron effect , here",
    "we would like to present our viewpoint as follows .",
    "first , the 5@xmath35 orbital is almost empty for both two phases of tho@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the transition - accompanied volume collapse in tho@xmath0 is irrelevant to the 5@xmath35 orbital effect .",
    "second , in other actinide dioxides , such as puo@xmath0 , although taking into account the 5@xmath35 electronic interaction is crucial to obtain more reasonable ground state @xcite , this local correlation effect is not expected to play a role in explaining the transition - accompanied volume collapse in these 5@xmath35-occupied actinide dioxides . the reason is simply because that inclusion of 5@xmath35 electronic localization will weaken the binding of cations and anions , causing an increase instead of a decrease in the volume of system .",
    "therefore , the phenomenon of volume collapse during high - pressure phase transition of the actinide dioxides is mainly attributed to the ionic ( instead of electronic ) response to the external compression .",
    "in summary , the ground state properties as well as the high pressure behavior of tho@xmath0 were studied by means of the first - principles dft - gga method .",
    "the elastic constants and their derived moduli and poisson s ratio were calculated for both the ambient _",
    "m _ and the high - pressure _ pnma _ phases of tho@xmath0 and were shown to accord well with recent reliable experiments . based on these results , mechanical stability of the _ pnma _ phase at zero pressure was predicted .",
    "the hardness , lattice vibration dynamics , and the th - o chemical bond of the ambient phase were calculated and analyzed in order to support the practical application of of tho@xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the th - o bond displays a mixed ionic / covalent character , with the valence of th and o ions represented as th@xmath1 and o@xmath2 . here the ionicity is mainly featured by charge transfer from th @xmath36 states to o @xmath10 states , while the covalency is manifested by hybridization of oxygen 2__s _ _ and thorium 6__p _ _ states .",
    "this mixed ionic / covalent feature makes tho@xmath0 a hard material , with its hardness calculated in this paper to be @xmath2527 gpa . as another main task , we studied phase transition of tho@xmath0 under high pressure .",
    "our calculated _ _",
    "transition pressure is 26.5 gpa , according well with recent experimental results of @xmath2530 gpa .",
    "our calculated transition - accompanied volume collapse of 5.9% is also in good agreement with the experimental data of 6.1% . under more higher pressure",
