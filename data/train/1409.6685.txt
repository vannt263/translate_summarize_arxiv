    "if we restrict our generators ( [ odecoequations2 ] ) to these @xmath380 variables only , the restriction of the term order is the same as the term order in the case @xmath381 , and we have shown that in this case , the restricted generators form a grbner basis . therefore , we can reduce the s - pair of @xmath377 and @xmath378 to @xmath78 using the generators ( [ odecoequations2 ] ) .",

    "the reasoning is similar if @xmath396 .",

    "suppose @xmath431 is not initial , i.e. there exists @xmath439 such that @xmath440 . choose @xmath433 with in@xmath441 as small as possible .",
    "since the elements @xmath383 form a grbner basis of @xmath187 , then , there exist @xmath442 such that in@xmath441 is divisible by in@xmath443 .",

    "therefore , each variable @xmath320 , such that @xmath490 or @xmath491 , contributes a size @xmath495 nonzero block to @xmath477 , so it contributes 1 to the rank .",
    "therefore , the rank of @xmath477 is @xmath496 @xmath497 thus , the rank of the jacobian at a smooth point in the irreducible component of @xmath7 is at least @xmath498 , so the dimension of an irreducible component containing @xmath7 is at most @xmath305 .    since the odeco variety is irreducible , has dimension @xmath305 , contains @xmath7 , and is contained in @xmath453 , then it is one of the irreducible components of @xmath453 .",
