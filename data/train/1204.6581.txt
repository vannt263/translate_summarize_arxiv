    "the quickly evolving field of spintronics has pointed to an increasing need for a complete understanding of contacts between superconductors ( scs ) and spin - polarized materials such as ferromagnets ( fms ) . compared to hybrids between a normal metal and a sc one not only observes the interplay of the two densities of states ( doss ) but also effects of the different spin ordering in the contacted materials .",

    "in the previous section it is mentioned that a realistic description of the interface region is necessary for a complete understanding of sfqpcs .",
    "this can be achieved by considering a more complex model that explicitely includes a spin - dependent scattering potential@xcite at the interface .",
    "this is of special importance when dealing with the experimentally relevant case of strong spin polarisation @xmath50 .",
    "the mechanism of spin - active scattering at the interface is the interplay of the ferromagnetic exchange field in both the bulk and the interface . in the simplest case the two magnetic moments deep in the bulk and at the interface would just be parallel .",
    "however , manifold processes may lead to an interface magnetic moment different from the bulk like using a thin magnetic layer , spin - orbit coupling , magnetic anisotropy or spin - relaxation .",

    "consequently the cgf shows single - electron transmission for the different spins as well as spin - flip transmission processes for energies above the gap , see fig .",
    "[ sar ] ( c ) and ( d ) . for energies below the gap we identify two types of andreev reflection : spin - symmetric andreev reflection ( ar ) and anomalous@xcite or spin - flip andreev reflection ( sar ) ,",

    "[ sar ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we therefore have obtained the fcs of all charge transfer processes that have also been identified in the quasi - classical green s function calculation.@xcite the only difference is the description of spin - active scattering .",

    "use the spin - mixing angle @xmath56 as the phenomenological parameter whereas we use a second tunneling transparency to account for spin flips .",
    "both descriptions are related since both give rise to andreev bound states characterised by @xmath57 from which one can calculate @xmath56 via @xmath58.@xcite         + the sar implies a spin - flip to convert a singlet cooper pair from the sc to a triplet pair in the fm , whereas ar just transfers singlets to the fm .",
    "spin - active scattering therefore gives rise to triplet correlations in the fm@xcite , which are responsible for a long - range proximity effect also in fms .",

    "the result incorporating spin - active scattering may also be compared to the best possible fit without spin - active scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we see that a consistent explanation of the experimental data heavily relies on the inclusion of a complete description of the interface region .",
    "the possibility of sar opens a new transport channel below the gap that leads to an increased conductance for @xmath75 .",
    "indeed the contribution by sar is sizeable since the ratio of sar vs. ar is determined by the ratio of @xmath76 and @xmath77 being of the order of @xmath78 .",
    "this is in accordance with other studies of different point contacts.@xcite + to account for the scaling of the experimental data we express our fit parameter @xmath12 in terms of the btk fit parameter @xmath63 .",
    "both fitting parameters are only identical when we use the cgf including spin - active scattering . also , the experiments on al / co contacts use samples with several transmission channels . the theoretical investigation in [ ]",
    ", however , revealed that the samples may be effectively described by a single - channel model using an effective transmission coefficient .",
    "the fcs allows for the calculation of the noise power given by the second derivative of the cgf @xmath79 . in the case of small interface transparency",
    "we find the smooth transition from andreev reflection noise ( corresponding to a fano factor of 2 ) below the gap to single electron noise above the gap ( corresponding to a fano factor of 1 ) , since these represent the only dominant charge transfer processes in these regimes .",
    "this picture is very similar to the one obtained for nsqpcs since the charge transfer processes in both systems are the same .",
    "in this section we study the generalisation of our results to qd geometries . even in the simplest case",
    "this requires the solution of the anderson impurity model with ferromagnetic leads .",
    "however , for the here analysed f - qd - s experiment@xcite the situation is such that we are clearly in the kondo regime for an odd number of electrons on the qd.@xcite in this case we observe the many - body spin 1/2 kondo resonance@xcite for temperatures below the kondo temperature @xmath80 .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath81 , two scenarios may occur : for small @xmath81 the kondo resonance is weakly coupled to the sc due to the absence of mobile electrons at the fermi edge . for large @xmath81 the kondo resonance couples to the quasiparticles in the sc .",
    "this picture is confirmed both theoretically and experimentally : theoretically the dot spectral density for a normal - qd - sc system has been analysed in [ ] showing a cross - over from a double peak around the fermi energy to a single kondo resonance upon increasing onsite interaction @xmath82 .",
    "it was also found that the double peak is due to the sc proximity effect .",
    "experimentally for two superconducting drains and @xmath83 the kondo effect is suppressed@xcite whereas for a sc hybrid junction and @xmath83 one observes a strong suppression of the effective hybridisation between the dot and the superconducting drain.@xcite + this picture allows for a ad hoc but practicable approach to our more complicated setup , which is supported by comparison to the experimental data . since we are clearly in the kondo regime we may assume to be at the strong - coupling fixed point where a perfectly transmitting channel opens up and the transport properties of the kondo effect can be described as the ones of a pure resonant level system as far as the electronic transport is concerned.@xcite additionally , we want to assume to have @xmath81 small .",
    "our approach will therefore be limited to the constellation of parameters @xmath84 .",
    "in this situation we will encounter a weak coupling of the sc to the kondo resonance and we may use an effective description of the kondo resonance as a resonant level weakly coupled to the sc on top of a ( small ) background conductance@xcite in order to describe the experiment .",
    "the background conductance describes in a first approximation the dos outside the kondo peak , e.g. the hubbard subbands at @xmath85 .",
    "an effective model for the normal - qd - sc case was analysed in [ ] where the resulting transmission coefficients for the kondo resonance are just the product of the transmission coefficient for the tunneling case with the dos of a resonant level .",
    "this simple model has been verified both theoretically and experimentally : we compared the conductance features of our approach to the theoretical calculation in [ ] and observed good agreement in the considered range of parameters . in [ ] the results of this ansatz were compared to the experimental data from [ ] .",
    "such procedure may also be applied to the fm - case as one can see from the calculation for the resonant level.@xcite + addtionally we have to take into account that the kondo resonance splits into a doublet in a magnetic field according to the zeeman energy and is also strongly affected by the exchange field of the fm . using haldane s scaling method for a flat band structure with spin dependent tunneling rates and including a finite stoner splitting of the leads an analytical formula for the energy splitting of the spin-@xmath7 and spin-@xmath8 bands is found@xcite to be that are relevant for the scaling argument given here .",

    "the transmission coefficients for the case of a f - qd - s device can thus be deduced from the transmission coefficients for the sfqpc and the relevant effective dos @xmath94 additionally we have to include the background conductance , which may be done using the standard levitov - lesovik formula@xcite @xmath95\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an energy - independent transmission coefficient @xmath96 for electron transfer .",

    ". however , we checked that in the limit of @xmath103 , that represents the typical experimental case of small hybridisation of the sc with the kondo resonance , the corresponding transmission coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 may safely be neglected since their contribution is marginal .",

    "we did not include a spin - active tunneling term as in eq .",
    "( [ spinflip ] ) .",
    "such a term would couple the tunnel transmission for one spin species to the kondo singlet for the opposite spin , which would reduce the asymmetry in the peaks .",

    "a subgap feature of this type will be discussed in section [ even ] , where we show its relevance for a qd in the even state .",
    "both characteristics are not observed and the value for the polarisation ( @xmath108 ) that reflects the asymmetry of the peaks is in perfect accordance with previous experimental studies of point contacts .",
    "the absence of spin - active scattering even in the presence of a strongly polarized fm is related to the strong asymmetry of the couplings between the dot and the fm or the sc respectively .",
    "the kondo effect is mainly due to hybridized fm bulk states so that specifics of the interface or the sc are hardly seen .",
    "this also explains why the theory in [ ] applies also for the case of a f - qd - s junction even though it has been derived for a qd coupled to two ferromagnetic leads . + the cgf in eq .",

    "the fano factor does not change considerably since andreev reflections are not only suppressed by the small tunneling coupling but also by the kondo peak splitting .",
    "therefore higher order cumulants are necessary to decide the presence of andreev reflections in these devices .",
    "+ it is remarkable that the asymmetry and splitting deduced from the model can be explained with a reasonable choice of the @xmath91-factor of inas and the polarisation of cobalt .",
    "additionally , the asymmetry of the kondo conductance peaks can be traced back to the different spin species which we want to exploit in the next section .",
    "in this section we show that the f - qd - s device can be used for spin measurement .",
    "we take advantage of the above observation that andreev reflection can be neglected as far as conductance is concerned and obtain the fcs for the separate spins as @xmath120 @xmath121 is obtained from @xmath98 by setting @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
