    "the standard model ( sm ) provides an accurate description of all the results from high energy physics experiments , in particular precision electroweak measurements and flavor physics observables .",
    "these experiments put strong constraints on extensions of the sm that have tree - level flavor changing neutral current effects or large custodial symmetry breaking effects .",
    "for renormalizable , weakly interacting theories , where the new exotic particles acquire large gauge invariant masses so that they decouple from the low energy effective theory , these constraints can be avoided .",
    "low energy supersymmetry  @xcite is a particularly attractive example of this kind of theory .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model or mssm ( with gauge invariant susy breaking masses of the order of 1 tev ) predicts an extended higgs sector with a light sm - like higgs boson of mass lower than 135 gev  @xcite@xcite that agrees well with precision electroweak measurements .",
    "however the structure of supersymmetry breaking parameters is not well defined .",
    "if there are no tree - level flavor changing transitions in any gauge or super - gauge interaction , then the deviations from sm predictions are naturally small .",
    "such small deviations can be achieved if the quark and squark mass matrices are block diagonalizable in the same basis .",
    "for instance , this happens when the squark and slepton supersymmetry breaking masses are flavor independent .",
    "for these kinds of models , all flavor violating effects are induced at the loop - level and are governed by the ckm matrix elements , as in the sm .",
    "many studies have concentrated on the properties of these minimal flavor violating scenarios ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .    in this article",
    "we shall analyze their flavor violating effects in two quite generic cases . in the first case",
    ", we consider a low energy effective theory in which the quark and squark mass matrices are aligned in flavor space and can be simultaneously diagonalized in blocks , as described in the next section .",
    "we will remain agnostic about how this effective low energy theory is uv completed .",
    "however , since the yukawa - induced radiative corrections to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters tend to destroy the alignment of the squark and quark mass matrices , this situation may be only naturally realized in models of low energy supersymmetry breaking , where these radiative corrections are small .",
    "we call this low energy scenario minimal flavor violation .    in order to study the possible effect of yukawa",
    "dependent radiative corrections we study a second case , in which we assume a departure from the alignment condition by the presence of flavor violating effects proportional to the ckm matrix elements .",
    "these effects are induced by corrections to the left - handed down squark mass matrices proportional to the product of the up - quark yukawa matrix and its hermitian conjugate ( or , in general , powers of this product ) .",
    "we furthermore assume that the right - handed down squark masses are flavor independent .",
    "as we will discuss in more detail in the next section , these conditions at low energies are achieved , for instance , by yukawa dependent radiative corrections , if one starts from flavor independent squark masses at a high energy scale at moderate values of @xmath6 .",
    "one characteristics of this second scenario is that there are flavor violating down - squark - gluino vertices at tree - level .",
    "since all flavor violating effects are governed by the ckm matrix elements , this scenario would also enter within the general definition of minimal flavor violating models given in ref .",
    "however , due to the presence of flavor violating couplings at tree level , we will denote it as non - minimal flavor violation in order distinguish it from the first scenario of flavor alignment at the weak scale , in which such tree - level effects are absent .",
    "as we will show , the phenomenological predictions in this scenario are similar to those of the flavor alignment case , unless the left - handed squarks and the gluino are very light .",
    "apart from the structure of supersymmetry breaking parameters , the phases associated with them are also important . in minimal flavor violating schemes",
    "there are at least two phases that can not be absorbed by redefining the low energy fields . for real values of the @xmath7 parameter",
    ", these phases can be associated with a universal phase for the gaugino masses and the trilinear mass parameter . in general , however , one can choose independent phases for the different gaugino masses and trilinear mass parameters .",
    "cp - violating phases beyond the ckm one are required , for instance , in models of electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite@xcite . in this scenario",
    ", there could be significant effects on @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 because of the presence of a light stop and extra phases in the chargino , neutralino and gluino sectors .",
    "we shall comment on the effects of these new cp violating phases below .",
    "in this paper we attempt to develop a systematic method of treating the extra sources of flavor violation in the minimal and non - minimal flavor violating models described above .",
    "we show that the usual approach of calculating @xmath10 enhanced fcnc ( flavor changing neutral currents ) effects in the kaon sector does not agree with the exact results one finds in the limit of flavor independent masses .",
    "thus , we develop a perturbative approach that leads to agreement with the exact result in this limit .",
    "we shall emphasize the implications of the present bounds on @xmath11 for future measurements at the tevatron collider , both in higgs as well as in b - physics .",
    "in particular , we shall show that the present bound on @xmath11 leads to strong constraints on possible corrections to both @xmath1 and the kaon mixing parameters in minimal flavor violating schemes .",
    "moreover , we shall show that this bound , together with the constraint implied by the measurement of @xmath12 leads to limits on the possibility detecting light , non - standard higgs bosons in the mssm at the tevatron collider . throughout the paper we always take real values of @xmath13 , and",
    "therefore the higgs sector is approximately cp - invariant  @xcite , and will be treated as such .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define our theoretical setup , giving the basic expressions necessary for the analysis of the flavor violating effects at large values of @xmath6 .",

    "assuming the squark masses are flavor independent at high energies , the only one - loop corrections that violate flavor are induced by the up and down yukawa matrices because the gauge interactions are flavor blind .",

    "the value of @xmath27 on the other hand , is maximized for large values of @xmath174 and values of @xmath7 that are of order two times the overall squark mass value . at the same time",
    ", large values of @xmath7 and/or @xmath174 may induce the presence of color breaking minima  @xcite .",
    "hence , values of @xmath175 maximize @xmath27 , while pushing @xmath41 to large values . for these values of the parameters ,",
    "the loop corrections are given by @xmath176 where we have constrained the trilinear mass parameter @xmath177 , so as not to create color breaking minima  @xcite .",
    "let us stress that the bounds on the parameters coming from color breaking minima may be avoided by assuming metastability of the electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "however , the somewhat extreme values of the parameters given above induce additional anomalies in the low energy spectrum .",
    "for instance , values of @xmath178 , decrease the physical higgs mass to values lower than the current experimental bound on this quantity  @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is also important to stress that for negative values of @xmath179 , the coupling @xmath180 may be enhanced by taking even larger values of @xmath181 .",
    "indeed , @xmath27 only falls off slowly for larger @xmath181 , while @xmath169 increases linearly and therefore @xmath180 grows with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "we shall comment on the effect of taking larger values of @xmath181 below .",
    "in the region of large @xmath14 the heavy cp - even and cp - odd masses are approximately equal and the higgs mixing angle @xmath182 , so that the dominant contribution to @xmath168 is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath416 the infinities present in @xmath417 in @xmath27 s clearly cancel , however the infinities in @xmath41 s need to be absorbed by counter terms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "so that the @xmath417 contributions to the @xmath418 s in the above formulae are purely the finite pieces .",
