    "the cosmological back - reaction problem continues to generate considerable ( and sometimes quite heated ) debate .",
    "@xcite there is significant disagreement as to just how one should split the universe into `` smooth background '' plus `` local perturbations '' , and yet more disagreement as to whether or not these perturbations remain small .",
    "i shall work within the framework of conformally - flrw ( cflrw ) cosmologies ,  @xcite where the mathematics and physics are both firmly under control .",
    "@xcite these cflrw cosmologies are simply generic flrw spacetimes distorted by a ( possibly non - perturbatively large ) conformal factor .",
    "cosmographically  @xcite this is the unique non - perturbative distortion that can be applied to flrw cosmologies without grossly modifying the cmb .",
    "@xcite in counterpoint , when working in this cflrw framework , buchert s coarse - graining procedure simplifies tremendously .",
    "the contribution to the effective stress - energy due to coarse graining can be explicitly calculated .",
    "this coarse - graining contribution to the effective stress - energy need not be traceless , though it will typically satisfy the classical energy conditions .",
    "( further details are in preparation .",
    "let @xmath0 represent a flrw spacetime . adopt conformal time for the flrw . then : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is translation invariant in both space and ( conformal ) time . on this flrw space - time",
    ", define coarse - graining by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is any non - negative translation - invariant normalized kernel in both space and ( conformal ) time .",
    "the high symmetries of flrw are essential to this construction .",
    "in this flrw framework , coarse - graining the gradient of a scalar is the same as taking the gradient of the coarse - grained scalar : @xmath5 \\ ; \\phi(y ) \\;\\d^4 y   \\\\ & = &   + \\oint    [ \\nabla_x f(x - y)]\\ ; \\phi(y ) \\ ; \\d^4 y \\\\ & = &   \\nabla_x   \\oint    f(x - y)\\ ; \\phi(y ) \\;\\d^4 y   \\\\ & = & \\nabla_x \\langle \\phi(x ) \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] translation invariance of the kernel is crucial to establishing this result .    now calculate : @xmath6(x - y ) \\ ;   \\ ; \\phi(y ) \\;\\d^4 y \\\\ & \\neq &   \\langle \\phi(x ) \\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so you have to be very careful . since @xmath7 , then if you insist on using the word `` averaging '' to describe the coarse - graining process , it follows that `` the average of the average is not the average '' .",
    "this is at gross variance with the normal use of the word `` averaging '' , and for this reason i shall eschew this term . furthermore : @xmath8 more precisely @xmath9 for ensemble averages , or indeed any situation where the normal rules of averaging apply , that second line vanishes .",
    "but it does not vanish for a coarse - graining process .",
    "for these reasons the phrase `` coarse - graining '' is more appropriate than the word `` averaging '' . while one can",
    "not now naively assert @xmath10 based on the usual `` averaging '' arguments , this inequality can instead be derived from positivity of the coarse - graining kernel plus an appeal to the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality : @xmath11",

    "\\nonumber   \\\\   & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a specific , ( very high symmetry ) , case of buchert coarse - graining , one where all the technical details are now fully under control .",
    "the coarse - grained spacetime `` sees '' the effective stress - energy @xmath21 the part of the `` effective stress tensor '' due to cflrw coarse - graining is : @xmath22 - g_{ab } [ \\langle|\\nabla\\phi|^2\\rangle - |\\nabla\\langle\\phi\\rangle|^2].\\ ] ] note that this vanishes ( as it should ) in the limit where the smearing kernel becomes a delta function ( so that coarse - graining is switched off ) . for the trace of this buchert contribution to the effective stress tensor we have @xmath23",
    "this need not be zero , and generically is in fact nonzero .",
    "since the first term is positive and the last three terms are negative , the trace can easily be arranged to be either positive or negative .",
    "in contrast , this effective stress energy typically will satisfy many of the other classical energy conditions .     for instance , for null vectors , using the flrw symmetries to assert @xmath24 , we have :  @xcite @xmath25 so the null energy condition ( nec ) is satisfied for this form of coarse - graining .     for timelike vectors , we have :  @xcite @xmath26 use a tetrad decomposition with @xmath27 being the timelike vector @xmath28 of interest , then @xmath29 this is a positive definite euclidean signature `` metric '' . now using the flrw symmetries to assert @xmath30 , we have @xmath31",
    "so the weak energy condition ( wec ) is satisfied for this form of coarse - graining .     for the strong energy condition ( sec ) consider the trace - reversed quantity  @xcite @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then for timelike vectors @xmath33 so the strong energy condition ( sec ) is satisfied for this form of coarse - graining .",

    "the `` effective @xmath34 parameter '' is @xmath39 this contribution to stress - energy always has @xmath40 .",
    "when studying buchert coarse - graining , working with cflrw spacetimes is a great technical help .",
    "specifically , a flrw background provides you with a very nicely controlled version of buchert coarse - graining , and cflrw coarse - graining satisfies some nice differential identities .",
    "indeed cflrw coarse - graining yields an explicit and tractable effective stress - energy .",
    "the effective stress energy is not necessarily traceless .",
    "furthermore for this form of coarse - graining the classical energy conditions are satisfied by the effective stress - energy .",
    "finally i emphasize that buchert coarse - graining @xmath41 ensemble average ; several key properties are radically different .",
