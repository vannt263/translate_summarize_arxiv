    "it is worthwile to notice that the @xmath103 expansion fails to simultaneously reproduce both @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the second reason for the large value of @xmath135 in ( [ trs ] ) is the special treatment of the final state phases as described after ( [ trs ] ) , which is controversial @xcite .",
    "it is highly desirable to gain a full dynamical understanding of both the @xmath28 enhancement in @xmath111 and possibly in @xmath2 and the large final state interaction phase @xmath170 causing the discussed ambiguity in @xmath135 . to this end in @xcite",
    "a resonant enhancement of @xmath171 caused by the @xmath172 @xcite resonance has been discussed .",
    "@xmath3 is a broad s - wave @xmath18 resonance almost degenerate in mass with the kaon . in theories based on",
    "a chiral lagrangian @xmath3 corresponds to resonant @xmath173 rescattering in the @xmath18 channel , an all - order effect depicted in fig .",
    "[ sig ] .",
    "= 0.9    unfortunatley the progressing lattice calculations will not help to understand such a resonant enhancement of @xmath2 , because they will determine @xmath174 rather than @xmath175 !",
    "even if reliable lattice results for @xmath174 are present , there will still be a sizeable model dependence in the prediction of @xmath176 .",
    "finally another source of theoretical uncertainties has been recently suggested @xcite : isospin violations in @xmath177 resulting from @xmath178 can substantially enlarge the range @xmath179 used in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath135 is a short distance dominated process , it is sensitive to new physics , which can modify the wilson coefficients @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath61 s are generated by feynman diagrams like those in fig .",
    "[ peng ] at some high scale @xmath84 of the order of @xmath180 or of the mass of some new particle entering the loop diagrams .",
    "the renormalization group evolution down to the scale @xmath181 , at which the matrix elements in ( [ p0 ] ) are calculated , mixes the coefficients @xmath61 .",
    "now @xmath182 is mainly an admixture of the wilson coefficient of @xmath168 , which is generated by tree - level @xmath183-exchange and is therefore hardly affected by new physics . on the other hand @xmath184 is merely loop - induced and stems mainly from the @xmath4-vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ peng ] ) .",
    "it is therefore sensitive to new physics .",
    "if new contributions to @xmath185 have the opposite sign of the standard model contribution , @xmath135 will be enhanced . further the chromomagnetic operator @xmath186 can play a role . in the standard model",
    "its coefficient equals @xmath187 and the impact on @xmath135 is negligible @xcite , so that @xmath188 has been omitted in ( [ p0 ] ) .",
    "a model - independent discussion of new contributions to @xmath185 and @xmath189 has been performed in @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the standard model result for @xmath189 by a factor of order @xmath190 is necessary for a sizeable impact on @xmath135 .",
    "the high experimental value in ( [ exp ] ) has stimulated new theoretical work on possible new physics contributions to @xmath135 , mainly in supersymmetric theories .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) does not help to understand the puzzles of flavour physics .",
    "moreover , the minimal supersymmetric standard model with the most general soft susy - breaking mechanism leads to unacceptably large flavour - changing neutral transitions .",
    "hence additional assumptions on the susy - breaking terms are necessary , most commonly flavour - blindness of these terms ( `` universality '' ) at some high scale . yet in these scenarios the impact of susy on @xmath135 is small , and in most of the parameter space @xmath135 is depleted rather than enhanced @xcite . alternatively one can relax the universality assumption and allow for arbitrary flavour off - diagonal entries in the squark mass matrix . here one proceeds phenomenologically , encounters all experimental constraints from other flavour - changing processes @xcite and finally estimates the maximal impact on @xmath135 or other processes of interest . in these generic susy models , however , the situation for @xmath135 is different than in scenarios with flavour universality : it is possible to have sizeable contributions to the imaginary parts of the @xmath4-vertex affecting @xmath185 @xcite and the chromomagnetic @xmath5-gluon - vertex modifying @xmath189 @xcite without violating the stringent bounds from kaon mixing and other flavour - changing processes",
    ". then @xmath135 can even be dominated by new physics . in @xcite an approximate flavour symmetry controlling the yukawa matrix and",
    "the susy a - matrix has been postulated .",
    "then the small weak @xmath55 transition proportional to @xmath191 in ( [ eps ] ) is replaced by a strong transition of order @xmath47 producing the necessary enhancement factor . a recent detailed analysis",
    "@xcite has found an enhancement of @xmath135 through @xmath189 more likely than through @xmath185 .",
    "finally in addition a mass splitting between up and down squarks also generates new @xmath144 contributions via box diagrams which likewise influence @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "it is difficult , but possible to accomodate @xmath192 in the standard model .",
    "i have discussed the following mechanisms to explain the large measured value in ( [ exp ] ) :    * small @xmath85 as indicated by recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "* @xmath28 enhancement of @xmath2 @xcite . * larger isospin breaking characterized by the parameter @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "* decrease of the imaginary part of the @xmath4-vertex ( and thereby of @xmath185 ) by new physics @xcite . * @xmath193 enhancement of the chromomagnetic @xmath5-gluon - vertex ( and thereby of @xmath189 ) by new physics @xcite .    in the future one can expect improvements in the prediction of @xmath135 from a better knowledge of @xmath85 from @xmath141-decays @xcite and from a better determination of @xmath50 , once the dedicated b- and k - experiments @xcite will give us a clear picture of the unitarity triangle . on the other hand i do not expect much progress in @xmath2 from lattice calculations , because these calculations will not determine @xmath194 directly .",
    "hence the question of new physics in @xmath135 will stay inconclusive and the corresponding new contributions will more likely be revealed in the measurements @xcite of rare kaon decays @xcite .",
    "i thank matthias neubert for inviting me to this conference and stephane narison and his team for creating the pleasant and stimulating atmosphere .",
    "i have enjoyed a lot of fruitful discussions with many colleagues .",
