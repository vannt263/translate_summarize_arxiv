    "any network found in the literature is inevitably just a sampled representative of its real - world analogue under study .",
    "for instance , many networks change quickly over time and in most cases merely incomplete data is available on the underlying system .",
    "additionally , network sampling techniques are lately often applied to large networks to allow for their faster and more efficient analysis . since the findings of the analyses and simulations on such sampled networks are implied for the original ones , it is of key importance to understand the structural differences between the original networks and their sampled variants .    a large number of studies on network sampling focused on the changes in network properties introduced by sampling .",
    "lee  et  al .",
    "@xcite showed that random node and link selection overestimate the scale - free exponent  @xcite of the degree and betweenness centrality  @xcite distributions , while they preserve the degree mixing  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "random node selection preserves the degree distribution of different random graphs  @xcite and performs better for larger sampled networks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , leskovec  et  al .",
    "@xcite showed that the exploration sampling using random walks or forest - fire strategy  @xcite outperforms the random selection techniques in preserving the clustering coefficient  @xcite , different spectral properties  @xcite , and the in - degree and out - degree distributions .",
    "more recently , ahmed  et  al .",
    "@xcite proposed random link selection with additional induction step , which notably improves on the current state - of - the - art .",
    "their results confirm that the proposed technique well captures the degree distributions , shortest paths  @xcite and also the clustering coefficient of the original networks . lately",
    ", different studies also focus on finding and correcting biases in sampling process , for example observing the changes of user attributes under the sampling of social networks  @xcite , analyzing the bias of traceroute sampling  @xcite and understanding the changes of degree distribution and hubs inclusion under various sampling techniques  @xcite .",
    "however , despite all those efforts , the changes in network structure introduced by sampling and the effects of network structure on the performance of sampling are still far from understood .",
    "real - world networks commonly reveal communities ( also link - density community  @xcite ) , described as densely connected clusters of nodes that are loosely connected between  @xcite . communities possibly play important roles in different real - world systems , for example in social networks communities represent friendship circles or people with similar interest  @xcite , while in citation networks communities can help us to reveal relationships between scientific disciplines  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , community structure has a strong impact on dynamic processes taking place on networks  @xcite and thus provides an important insight into structural organization and functional behavior of real - world systems .",
    "consequently , a number of community detection algorithms have been proposed over the last years  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "most of these studies focus on classical communities characterized by higher density of edges  @xcite .",
    "however , some recent works demonstrate that real - world networks reveal also other characteristic groups of nodes  @xcite like groups of structurally equivalent nodes denoted modules  @xcite ( also link - pattern community  @xcite and other  @xcite ) , or different mixtures of communities and modules  @xcite .    despite community structure",
    "appears to be an intrinsic property of many real - world networks , only a few studies considered the effects between the community structure and network sampling .",
    "salehi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed page - rank sampling , which improves the performance of sampling of networks with strong community structure .",
    "furthermore , expansion sampling  @xcite directly constructs a sample representative of the community structure , while it can also be used to infer communities of the unsampled nodes .",
    "other studies , for example analyzed the evolution of community structure in collaboration networks and showed that the number of communities and their size increase over time  @xcite , while the network sampling has a potential application in testing for signs of preferential attachment in the growth of networks  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the question whether sampling destroys the structure of communities and other groups of nodes or are sampled nodes organized in a similar way than nodes in original network remains unanswered .    in this paper",
    ", we study the presence of characteristic groups of nodes in different social and information networks and analyze the changes in network group structure introduced by sampling .",
    "we consider six sampling techniques including random node and link selection , network exploration and expansion sampling .",
    "the results first reveal that nodes in social networks form densely linked community - like groups , while the structure of information networks is better described by modules .",
    "however , regardless of the type of the network and consistently across different sampling techniques , the structure of sampled networks exhibits much stronger characterization by community - like groups than the original networks .",
    "we therefore conclude that the rich community structure is not necessary a result of for example homophily in social networks .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : sampl ] , we introduce different sampling techniques considered in the study , while the adopted node group extraction framework is presented in section  [ sec : nodegroups ] .",
    "the results of the empirical analysis are reported and formally discussed in section  [ sec : analys ] , while section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the paper and gives some prominent directions for future research .",
    "network sampling techniques can be roughly divided into two categories : random selection and network exploration techniques . in the first category , nodes or links",
    "are included in the sample uniformly at random or proportional to some particular characteristic like the degree of a node or its pagerank score  @xcite . in the second category ,",
    "the sample is constructed by retrieving a neighborhood of a randomly selected seed node using random walks , breadth - first search or another strategy . for the purpose of this study , we consider three techniques from each of the  categories .      from the random selection category ,",
    "we first adopt random node selection by degree  @xcite ( rnd ) . here , the nodes are selected randomly with probability proportional to their degrees , while all their mutual links are included in the sample ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : rnd ] ) .",
    "note that rnd improves the performance of the basic random node selection  @xcite , where the nodes are selected to the sample uniformly at random .",
    "rnd fits better spectral network properties  @xcite and produces the sample with larger weakly connected component  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it shows good performance in preserving the clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality distribution of the original networks  @xcite . nevertheless , it can still construct a disconnected sample network , despite a fully connected original network .",
    "next , we adopt random link selection  @xcite ( rls ) , where the sample consists of links selected uniformly at random ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : rls ] ) .",
    "rls overestimates degree and betweenness centrality exponent , underestimate the clustering coefficient and accurately matches the assortativity of the original network  @xcite .",
    "the samples created with rls are sparse and the connectivity of the original network is not preserved , still rls is likely to capture the path length of the original network  @xcite .",
    "last , we adopt random link selection with induction  @xcite ( rli ) , which improves the performance of rls . in rli ,",
    "the sample consists of randomly selected links as before , while also all additional links between their endpoints ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : rli ] ) .",
    "rli outperforms several other methods in capturing the degree , path length and clustering coefficient distribution .",
    "it selects nodes with higher degree than rls , thus the connectivity of the sample is increased  @xcite .",
    "techniques from random selection category imitate classical statistical sampling approaches , where each individual is selected from population independently from others until desired size of the sample is reached .      from the network exploration category ,",
    "we first adopt breadth - first sampling  @xcite ( bfs ) . here , a seed node is selected uniformly at random , while its broad neighborhood retrieved from the basic breadth - first search is included in the sample ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : bfs ] ) .",
    "the sample network is thus a connected subgraph of the original network .",
    "bfs is biased towards selecting high - degree nodes in the sample  @xcite .",
    "it captures well the degree distribution of the networks , while it performs worst in inclusion of hubs in the sample quickly in the sampling process  @xcite .",
    "bfs imitates the snowball sampling approach for collecting social data used especially when the data is difficult to reach  @xcite .",
    "selected seed participant is asked to report his friends , which are than invited to report their friends .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the desired number of people is sampled .",
    "next , we adopt a modification of bfs denoted forest - fire sampling  @xcite ( ffs ) . in ffs ,",
    "the broad neighborhood of a randomly selected seed node is retrieved from partial breadth - first search , where only some neighbors are included in the sample on each step ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : ffs ] ) .",
    "the number of neighbors is sampled from a geometric distribution with mean @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is set to @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "ffs matches well spectral properties  @xcite , while it underestimates the degree distribution and fails to match the path length and clustering coefficient of the original networks  @xcite .",
    "however , ffs corresponds to a model by which one author collects the papers to cite and include them in the bibliography  @xcite .",
    "the author starts with one paper , explores its bibliography and selects the papers to cite .",
    "the procedure is recursively repeated in selected papers until desired collection of citations is reached .",
    "last , we adopt expansion sampling  @xcite ( exs ) , where the seed node is again selected uniformly at random , while the neighbors of the sampled nodes are included in the sample with probability proportional to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the concerned node , @xmath5 the current sample and @xmath6 the neighborhood of nodes in @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "note that exs ensures that the sample consists of nodes from most communities in the original network and that the nodes that are grouped together in the original network , are also grouped together in the sample  @xcite .",
    "exs imitates the modification of snowball sampling approach mentioned above , where for example we want to gather the data about individuals from different countries .",

    ". we also limit the number of groups extracted from the networks to @xmath254 ( i.e. , we consider top @xmath254 most significant groups with respect to the objective function ) .",

    "table  [ tbl : wnd ] shows the properties of groups , found in the original and sampled networks .",
    "the samples consist of smaller groups , still the mean size @xmath47 remains larger than the mean size @xmath51 .",
    "the majority of groups extracted from the original network are module - like , which reflects in the parameter @xmath25 slightly larger than @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the changes introduced by sampling are clear , since the samples contain less modules , which is revealed by a larger parameter @xmath25 .",
    "these findings are consistent with the results on smaller networks from previous sections .",
    "the _ notredame _ as an information network expectedly consists of densely linked groups similar to modules , while the structure of sampled networks exhibits stronger characterization by community - like groups .",
