    "phonons and their interaction with the electronic degrees of freedom are omnipresent in solid state devices . typically associated with heat , noise or dissipation , nowadays phonons are becoming actively used , which is the foundation of the emerging field of phononics @xcite .",
    "examples are the use of phonons in the form of strain pulses to manipulate the lasing properties of semiconductor structures @xcite or the application of phonons in the form of surface acoustic waves to control the dynamics in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the generation of coherent phonons in semiconductor nanostructures has been studied @xcite and also phonon lasers have been proposed @xcite . to explore genuine quantum features of phonons",
    "it is interesting to study their fluctuation properties and in particular the emergence of squeezing .",
    "squeezing refers to the reduction of fluctuations of a certain variable below their vacuum level .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the heisenberg uncertainty principle has to be fulfilled , which results in increased fluctuations of the conjugate variable . for photons , squeezing is well explored @xcite and is already used in applications , e.g. , to detect gravitational waves at the ligo experiment @xcite .",
    "the prospect of finding squeezing also in a mechanical system like phonons , and in particular in semiconductor systems , has triggered a lot of theoretical @xcite and experimental work @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss the emergence of squeezing for phonons generated by optically exciting a semiconductor quantum dot .    to be specific , we will study the fluctuation properties of optical phonons which result from an excitation with finite pulses .",
    "we will show that the pulse duration is indeed a crucial parameter for phonon squeezing .",

    "when searching for non - classical phonon states , it is convenient to use a system , where the electronic part is as simple as possible such that one can focus on the phonon properties .",
    "one such system is a self - assembled semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) which , under certain conditions , constitutes an electronic two - level system .",
    "when the electronic configuration in the qd system changes , in particular by optical excitation with laser light , the lattice reacts to this change by creating phonons . we will show that this can also affect the phonon fluctuations which opens up the possibility to manipulate these fluctuations by changing the excitation conditions .      in our model",
    "we treat the qd as a two - level system , which is justified in the case of a strongly confined qd excited by circularly polarized light , when only excitons with a single spin orientation can be generated .",
    "the ground state is denoted by @xmath0 and the exciton state by @xmath1 .",

    "for simplicity we assume that , as in the case of bulk phonons , the phonons can be classified in terms of a wave vector @xmath19 .",
    "a generalization to arbitrary phonon quantum numbers is straightforward .",
    "the first part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_pho ] ) describes the free phonon part with the dispersion relation @xmath20 and the second term describes the pure dephasing - type carrier - phonon interaction via the coupling matrix element @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "describes the fact that , due to the large difference between exciton and phonon energy the phonons do not induce transitions between exciton and ground state .",
    "they affect , however , the phase of the coherence between these states which , for finite pulses , also has an influence on the resulting occupation . in general",
    ", there can be different types of phonon modes ( e.g. , acoustic and optical , longitudinal and transverse ) and different coupling mechanisms ( e.g. , deformation potential or polar ) .",
    "here we assume that all these can be treated separately .",
    "the operators for the phonon displacement @xmath22 and phonon momentum @xmath23 are related to the phonon mode operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 via    @xmath26    and @xmath27    where @xmath28 denotes the polarization vector of the phonon mode , @xmath29 is the crystal density and @xmath30 is the normalization volume . in this paper",
    ", we are particularly interested in the fluctuation properties of the phonon displacement and momentum . these are given by @xmath31 squeezing occurs , if the fluctuations fall below their respective vacuum value @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "to simplify the discussion , we introduce the quantities    @xmath34    and @xmath35    these definitions are particularly handy to identify squeezing , because we only need to check if these quantities , which for simplicity we will call fluctuations in the following , become negative .",
    "thus , the presence of displacement or momentum squeezing is equivalent to @xmath36 or @xmath37 , respectively .      to calculate the dynamics of the system",

    "all electronic and phononic variables can be calculated .",
    "the pure phonon variables are encoded in the function    @xmath43    while the quantities related to the occupation of the electronic levels are given by the function @xmath44 and those related to the interband coherence are encoded in the function @xmath45 with @xmath46    for example , for @xmath47 , we retain the occupation @xmath48 , while phononic and phonon assisted variables can be obtained by derivatives of the corresponding functions with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 and setting @xmath47 afterwards , such as    @xmath49    using heisenberg s equations of motion , a closed set of equations of motion for the generating functions @xmath50 , @xmath45 , and @xmath44 can be derived @xcite .",
    "these are partial differential equations containing derivatives with respect to @xmath51 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "it has been shown that for an excitation with an arbitrary series of ultra short pulses an analytical solution of these equations of motion can be found , which holds for any type of dispersion relation @xmath20 and coupling matrix element @xmath21 and thus both for optical and acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "the limit of ultra short pulses is reached when the pulse duration is much shorter than the characteristic phonon - induced time scale . in this case",
    "the light - induced dynamics during the pulses and the phonon - induced dynamics between and after the pulses can be separated . for longer pulses ,",
    "when this separation of time scales is not anymore fulfilled , no analytical solution is known and numerical techniques have to be applied . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the case of interaction with optical phonons , in which a numerically tractable set of equations of motion for the characteristic functions can be obtained .",
    "a detailed discussion of the phonon dynamics and phonon squeezing in the case of acoustic phonons can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for acoustic phonons",
    "it has been found that squeezed single or sequences of wave packets can be generated , which travel away from the qd with the speed of sound .",
    "optical phonons are typically characterized by a negligible dispersion over the range of wave vectors which are coupled to the qd exciton .",
    "thus , they are well approximated by a constant phonon frequency @xmath52 . due to their vanishing group velocity",
    ", optical phonons do not travel but stay confined to the qd region where they are generated .",
    "typically , longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons are much more strongly coupled to the qd exciton than transverse optical ( to ) phonons .",
    "therefore in the following we will refer to lo phonons , although the formalism is the same for to phonons .",
    "in the case of a constant phonon frequency it is possible to rewrite the phonon modes in such a form that only a small number of modes couples to the exciton @xcite .",
    "we call the annihilation and creation operators in the new basis @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for an @xmath55-level system , at most @xmath56 modes",
    "are coupled @xcite , which in the case of a two - level system evaluates to three modes . because we take into account only the pure dephasing mechanism only the coupling matrix element to the excited state",

    "a comparison with values more typical for gaas - type qds can be found in @xcite .",
    "pulse excitation with an ultra short pulse ( @xmath102 ) at three different times . ]",
    "the phonon dynamics induced by a single or a pair of ultra short optical pulses has been analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we review the main results , which serve as a reference for the case of longer pulses discussed below .    before discussing the generation of squeezed phonons ,",
    "it is instructive to recall some features of coherent phonons .",
    "coherent states fulfill the heisenberg uncertainty relation between the fluctuations of the displacement @xmath103 and the fluctuations of the momentum @xmath104 at its minimum value .",
    "furthermore , in the dimensionless form of @xmath80 and @xmath81 introduced above both fluctuations are equal .",
    "this condition is also realized , when the fluctuations agree with their vacuum values . in this sense",
    ", the vacuum state is a specific coherent state .",
    "since phonons are described by bosonic ladder operators in the harmonic approximation , the vacuum state can be described by the ground state in a harmonic potential as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "phonons are in the vacuum state , when no phonon excitation has taken place , and in particular , when the qd is in its ground state prior to the optical excitation . in terms of the wigner function",
    ", the vacuum state corresponds to a two - dimensional gaussian with equal widths in @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which is centered at the origin as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : limit_short ]  a ) .",
    "if the qd exciton is created , e.g. , by the application of a @xmath14 pulse , the harmonic potential for the phonons shifts due to the electron - phonon interaction , thus the equilibrium position for the phonons associated with the exciton state lies at a finite value of @xmath80 , which is determined by the coupling constant @xmath105 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . in the limiting case of an ultra short pulse",
    ", the optical excitation occurs so fast that the lattice ions can not follow .",
    "thus , the potential changes instantaneously while the form and position of the wave function are conserved . in the shifted potential , the state is now displaced with respect to the potential minimum at @xmath106 making it a coherent state , which oscillates in time @xcite . in the wigner function for the lo phonons shown in fig .  [ fig : limit_short ]  a)-c ) at three different times this is clearly visible .",
    "the wigner function moves on a circle around its new equilibrium position at @xmath107 , but keeps its form .",
    "we want to remark that here the value of the coupling constant @xmath105 only determines the position of the shifted equilibrium .",
    "the subsequent dynamics is not affected by this value .",
    "pulses with a delay of @xmath108 between them leading to the formation of two cat states . ]",
    "let us now turn to squeezed phonons . in the wigner function",
    ", squeezing is seen , when the phase space distribution looks indeed squeezed , i.e. , it is narrower in one direction in phase space than the wigner function of the coherent state , hence its name .",
    "there are several ways to created squeezed states . typically squeezing is described by the action of the a squeezing operator on a coherent state @xcite , but also special superposition states can lead to squeezing . in the wigner function quantum mechanical effects are indicated by negative values , which can result in a reduced width . in a more strict definition",
    ", squeezing occurs , if the fluctuations of one of the variables fall below their respective vacuum fluctuations . because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle this always results in an increased fluctuation of the other variable and , thus , a squeezed wigner function .",
    "the optical excitation by a single ultra short pulse only results in a coherent state or , if the optical excitation is not complete , in a statistical mixture of vacuum state and coherent state .",
    "thus , squeezing is never achieved in this case .",
    "however , using two ultra short pulses it has been shown that it is possible to excite squeezed phonon states @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of squeezing can be explained by the build up of phononic cat states @xcite , which are superpositions of two coherent states .",
    "one example of the phonon wigner function for the excitation with two @xmath109 pulses with a delay of @xmath108 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cat ] .",
    "the two circles represent the movement of the centers of the coherent states , where the smaller circle corresponds to the exciton potential and the larger one to the ground state potential .",
    "four coherent states emerge , which form a mixture of two cat states seen by the stripe pattern between two pairs of coherent states . for certain parameters squeezing occurs in cat states due to the quantum mechanical interference @xcite , when the states are close enough to overlap in phase space . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that squeezing for a two pulse excitation can be found for a wide range of parameters considering coupling strength , phase relation between the pulses , delay and pulse areas .       pulse excitation with an ultra long pulse ( @xmath110 ) at three different times . ]    in the other limiting case of a pulse that is very long compared to the phonon period , the situation is different .",
    "the corresponding wigner function is shown again at three different times in fig .",
    "[ fig : limit_long ] a)-c ) . in this case",
    "no analytical solution is possible , instead the wigner function has been obtained from the numerical solution of the equations of motion [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) ] for the generating functions . during the pulse the phonons are in a mixture of the phonon ground states associated with the two electronic potentials .",
    "thus , the wigner function changes its shape as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : limit_long ] c ) , as is expected for a quasi - adiabatic state preparation of the exciton .",
    "this new equilibrium state represents the polaron that has been built up .",
    "the final state after the pulse is therefore again a symmetric gaussian , but now at the new equilibrium position @xmath111 . in the exciton subsystem",
    "it is the vacuum state , while seen from the perspective of the electronic ground state it is displaced and thus a coherent but stationary state .",
    "again this does not alter the fluctuation properties of the phonons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was reported that the action of a long pulse would result in the creation of a fock state , which is in contrast to our findings .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the use of perturbation theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , which might lose its validity in the limit of long times .",
    "note that our generating function treatment provides a numerically complete solution of the dynamics in the considered model without further approximation except for the discretization of @xmath51 and @xmath62 , which is however well controlled .",
    "in particular , no perturbative approximation is made .",
    "indeed , for the short pulse excitation , where perturbation theory typically works properly , our results and the results found in ref .",
    "@xcite agree on the creation of a coherent state .    from our calculations",
    "we thus conclude that both excitations with ultra short and ultra long single pulses yield coherent phonon states after the excitation @xcite , in the former case oscillating around the new equilibrium position and in the latter case localized at this equilibrium position .",
    "also during the long pulse , the fluctuations remain at or above the vacuum levels , as already implied by the stretched wigner function in fig .",

    "we now analyze the case of excitation by pulses with pulse durations in the intermediate regime , i.e. , in the regime where the pulse duration @xmath12 and the phonon oscillation period @xmath112 are of the same order . in this section",

    "one would expect a final value of @xmath125 for a pulse with @xmath116 . likewise",
    "the phonon expectation values and fluctuations start to oscillate . the expectation value of the displacement @xmath114 oscillates around a shifted mean value .",

    "we have extracted the minimal value of @xmath128 and @xmath131 after the action of the pulse , e.g. , for @xmath132 in the previous example . because we consider lo phonons and we have neglected any phonon decay , the oscillation after the pulse is periodic with the phonon period @xmath112 and will go on forever . for very long times ,",

    "we find that squeezing of both displacement and momentum can indeed occur , however the degree of squeezing is rather small with less than 5% .",
    "we find that squeezing occurs in the transition region between the limiting cases of ultra short and long pulses .",
    "interestingly , the occurrence of squeezing is accompanied by a rather atypical behavior of the occupation .",
    "while for ultra short pulses we find the typical rabi rotations with maxima at @xmath137 , for longer pulses , the phonon - induced renormalization of the rabi rotations is clearly visible , i.e. , the period of the rabi flops gets longer . for intermediate pulse areas",

    ", we see that the wigner function rotates , but its form is not stable . around the times @xmath141 and @xmath142 , where the momentum is squeezed , we see that the wigner function is indeed elongated along @xmath80 , but narrow in @xmath81 . on the other hand at time @xmath143 and @xmath144 , where the fluctuations of the displacement have a minimum , the wigner function is elongated along @xmath81 . though negative parts appear in the wigner function ,",
    "it is still wider than in the vacuum case and no squeezing occurs .    since",
    "the qd is driven by a coherent light field and the initial state is a pure state ( the ground state of the qd  phonon system ) , the total system consisting of qd exciton and phonons remains always in a pure state .",
    "however , in general the temporal evolution results in an entanglement of the electronic and the phononic subsystem .",
    "when only one of the two subsystems is considered , the other system is traced out .",
    "this leads to a loss of coherence .",
    "if the electronic system is traced out , the phononic system falls apart into two parts : one belonging to the ground state potential and one belonging to the exciton state potential . due to the loss of coherence , these two parts are in a statistical mixture .",
    "note that each part on its own corresponds to a pure state .",
    "also the wigner function can be separated into these two parts with @xmath145 being the wigner function in the ground state potential and @xmath146 for the exciton potential .",
    "the total wigner function is the sum of both parts @xmath147 reflecting the statistical mixture .",
    "one example for this is shown in fig .",

    "each part now rotates with a stable shape around its respective equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath145 around @xmath148 , while @xmath146 moves around @xmath149 .",
    "when the two parts are summed up , the shape of the total wigner function is not stable in time .     of the wigner function ( left ) , which can be separated into the wigner function belonging to the ground state potential @xmath145 ( middle ) and the one belonging to the exciton state potential @xmath146 ( right ) . ]",

    "the probability of finding a state @xmath157 is then given by @xcite @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the wigner function representation of the projection operator @xmath160 .",
    "such an expansion can also be done separately for the wigner functions in the two subspaces @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "this allows us to expand the wigner functions of the individual subspaces into the fock states @xmath161 corresponding to the respective potential .",
    "the wigner functions of the fock states in the ground state subspace are given by @xmath162 with @xmath163 being the laguerre polynomials .",
    "for the wigner functions @xmath164 in the exciton system we take @xmath165 .    as an example we expand the wigner functions from fig .",
    "[ fig : gx ] , where pronounced squeezing is visible .",
    "the probabilities obtained from this expansion are listed in table  [ tab : pn ] .",
    "note that the sums of the probabilities in each subsystem reflect the electronic occupations . in our case , this means @xmath166 and @xmath167 , as we have found in fig .",
    "[ fig : expec ]  a ) .",
    "because the full state is normalized , it follows that @xmath168 .",
    "when looking at the actual numbers in tab .  [ tab : pn ] , we see that in each electronic subsystem only the first two fock states , namely @xmath169 and @xmath170 , contribute significantly to the phonon state .",
    "as the listed probabilities @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 add up to almost @xmath175 , there are essentially no contributions from higher fock states .",
    "the fact that the phonon state in each subsystem forms a superposition essentially of the form @xmath176 is true for a wide range of pulse areas and durations .",
    "recently it was shown that the photons emitted from qds can be in a superposition of the lowest two fock states @xmath177 and @xmath178 , and it was experimentally demonstrated that these photons exhibiting squeezing @xcite .",
    "though , the photons couple in a different way to the qd and are described within the jaynes - cummings model , this shows that squeezing in such a superposition occurs in a wider range of systems .",

    "the strongest squeezing emerges , when the two pulses have a delay of @xmath182 and a pulse area of @xmath109 each .",
    "as we have seen , two pairs of phononic cat states build up , which for suitable coupling strengths ( e.g. , @xmath113 ) give rise to squeezing .",
    "another crucial pulse parameter is the phase difference @xmath183 between the two pulses . for a phase of @xmath180 the state is not squeezed , while for @xmath181 the squeezing is maximal .",
    "this is in agreement with squeezing in cat states , which also depends crucially on the phase in the superposition state @xcite .",
    "let us briefly revisit the influence of the phase on the excitation : for the same phase , each pulse changes the occupations of the electronic states letting them perform a part of a rabi rotation .",
    "when the phase difference is a multiple of @xmath109 , the second pulse does not change the occupation of the states , but only influences the phase difference of the electronic states , which in turn modifies the phonon properties drastically @xcite . in the following",
    "we will study how squeezing prevails using finite pulses .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2puls ] we show the minimum of the fluctuations @xmath128 and @xmath131 for a two pulse excitation with pulse areas @xmath109 each and a delay of @xmath179 as a function of the pulse width for two different phases @xmath180 and @xmath181 . for @xmath180 we do not find any squeezing for ultra short pulses",
    ". for short pulses with @xmath184 momentum squeezing occurs with a strength of about @xmath185% , similar to the case of the one pulse excitation . for @xmath186 ,",
    "both fluctuations are larger than zero and we do not find squeezing .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath187 , the fluctuations do not change as a function of pulse width anymore . here",
    ", the two pulses already form a single pulse . due to the phonon renormalization ,",
    "the pulse area is slightly smaller than @xmath14 . in this case",
    "a statistical mixture of two coherent states , one belonging to the ground state and one belonging to the exciton state , builds up leading to increased fluctuations in @xmath80 , while the momentum fluctuations stay at zero .",
    "note that these states are stationary and do not move in time .     of the total wigner function @xmath188 ( left ) and",
    "the separation into @xmath145 ( middle ) and @xmath146 ( right ) .",
    "the pulse width is @xmath184 for two pulses with pulse area",
    "@xmath109 each , a delay of @xmath108 and a phase @xmath181 . ]    for @xmath181 we already have squeezing of about @xmath189% in the displacement and about @xmath190% in the momentum at @xmath191 .",
    "if now the pulse width is taken to be finite , we see that the squeezing becomes even more pronounced with up to @xmath192% in @xmath128 at @xmath184 . for larger pulse width",
    "@xmath12 the squeezing in both displacement and momentum vanishes and for @xmath193 also reaches a constant value almost independent of the pulse area .",
    "it is interesting to note that also for a quantum well , i.e. , for a system with a continuous electronic spectrum , a two - pulse excitation with finite pulses can lead to lo phonon squeezing under similar excitation conditions regarding the phase difference @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of squeezing for small pulse areas can be nicely seen in the wigner function as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : wig_2puls ] , where we show a snapshot at time @xmath144 , where the squeezing is maximal for the two pulse excitation , i.e. , @xmath128 is minimal . when we separate the wigner function into the ground state and exciton contribution with @xmath194 , we see that already in the subspaces the wigner functions are elongated in @xmath81-direction with banana - like shapes oriented in opposite directions . in addition ,",
    "negative parts of the wigner function are visible , indicating the non - classical character of the superposition of the cat states . when added up to the total wigner function , as shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : wig_2puls ] , the wigner function becomes squeezed .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the emergence of squeezed lo phonons by the optical manipulation of a qd . after reviewing the results for ultra short excitation",
    ", we have presented new results discussing the influence of the pulse width on the creation of squeezed phonons . to this end , we have determined the solution of the equations of motion using a generating function formalism , from which the wigner function can be calculated directly . for a single pulse ,",

    "was already found for ultra - short pulses and we have shown that a strong squeezing prevails for extended pulses up to @xmath196 .",
