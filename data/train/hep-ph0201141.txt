    "if supersymmetry is connected to the hierarchy problem , it is expected @xcite that sparticles will be sufficiently light that at least some of them will be observable at the large hadron collder ( lhc ) or even at the tevatron .",
    "however it is not possible to set a rigorous bound on the sparticle masses . as the sparticle masses rise ,",
    "the fine tuning problem of the standard model reappears and the sparticle masses become large enough so that they are difficult to observe at lhc .    .benchmark sugra points and masses from ref .",

    "this constraint can be applied to the minimal sugra @xcite model and used to constrain the masses of the other sparticles .",
    "recently sets of paramters in the minimal sugra model have been proposed  @xcite that satisfy existing constraints , including the dark matter constraint and the one from the observed anomaly in the magnetic moment of the muon  @xcite , but do not impose any fine tuning requirements .",
    "this set of points is not a random sampling of the available parameter space but is rather intended to illustrate the possible experimental consequences .",
    "these points and their mass spectra are shown in table  [ points ] .",
    "most of the allowed parameter space corresponds to the case where the sparticles have masses less than 1 tev or so and is accessible to lhc .",
    "indeed some of these points are quite similar to ones studied in earlier lhc simulations @xcite@xcite .",
    "points a , b , c , d , e , g , j and l fall into this category . as the masses of the sparticles",
    "are increased , the lsp contribution to dark matter rises and typically violates the experimental constraints .",
    "however there are certain regions of parameter space where the annihilation rates for the lsp can be increased and the relic density of lsp s lowered sufficiently . in these narrow regions , the sparticle masses can be much larger .",
    "points f , k , h and m illustrate these regions .",
    "this paper considers point k , h and m at the lhc with a luminosity upgrade to @xmath0 per year , ( slhc ) and at a possible higher energy hadron collider ( vlhc ) .",
    "we assume an energy of @xmath1 for the vlhc and use the identical analysis for both machines .",
    "point f has similar pheonomenology to point k except that the squark and slepton masses are much larger and consequently more difficult to observe . for the purposes of this simulation , the detector performance at @xmath2 and at the vlhc",
    "is assumed to be the same as that of atlas for at the lhc design luminosity .",
    "in particular , the additional pileup present at higher luminosity is taken into account only by raising some of the cuts .",
