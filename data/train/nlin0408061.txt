    "in recent years , biomolecular modeling has received an ever increasing amount of attention , especially focused on the dna molecule as well as protein structures .",
    "the basic structure of dna is fairly well understood since the discovery of crick and watson @xcite , but it is becoming increasingly apparent that structure alone does not explain its complex functionality sufficiently @xcite .",
    "an example is the mechanism leading to _ bubble generation _ in dna , in which the two polypeptide strands open to allow replication of the molecule , processing of proteins or complete strand separation ( denaturation ) .",
    "thermal fluctuations at physiological temperatures and nonlinear localizations are expected to produce bubbles when geometrical features , such as twist and curvature , are taken into account .    in initial works investigating the denaturation bubble ,",
    "the geometrical features of the molecule were essentially neglected and energy localization was mostly attributed to inhomogeneities and impurities in the lattice chain , which may model the action of an enzyme @xcite , or nonlinear excitations @xcite .",
    "also , discreteness plays an important role for the localization of these excitations .",
    "the inhomogeneities have been modeled by different masses at various chain sites @xcite , by conformational defects @xcite or by changes in the coupling between molecular sites @xcite . also , different on - site potentials",
    "@xcite have been used as inhomogeneities , corresponding to the different number of hydrogen bonds between the two strands . in dna ,",
    "the at base pair connects through two hydrogen bonds , whereas the cg base pair has three .",
    "it has to some extent been experimentally verified that bubbles form at at - rich sections of the dna molecule @xcite , but recent work @xcite also suggests that other mechanisms are involved .",
    "recently , both long - range dipole - dipole interaction @xcite , helicity @xcite and curvature @xcite have been included in the nonlinear transport theory , as well as combinations of these effects @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that chain geometry induces effects similar to those of impurities @xcite .    in biological environments , thermal fluctuations",
    "are always present and have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example . in these references",
    "it was shown that solitons or discrete breathers can be generated from or exist among random thermal fluctuations .",
