    "the crab nebula ( @xmath7(184.6)-(5.8 ) ) , the remnant of the sn of 1054 ( e.g.  stephenson & green 2002 ) , shows a centrally brightened morphology , and it is the best known of the class of ` filled - centre ' supernova remnants ( or ` plerions ' ) .",
    "it is powered by its central pulsar , and emits synchrotron emission with a relatively flat spectral index at radio wavelengths , with a spectral index @xmath8 here defined in the sense that flux density @xmath9 scales with frequency @xmath10 as @xmath11 , of @xmath12 ( baars et al .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the crab nebula steepens at higher frequencies , with a break wavelength in the mid - infrared ( e.g.  marsden et al.1984 ; woltjer 1987 ) , which is at much higher frequencies than for other filled - centre remnants such as 3c58 ( @xmath7(130.7)+(3.1 ) ; see green & scheuer 1992 ) , which is consistent with the central pulsar in the crab still being active .

    "we conclude that the excess emission in the fir bump ( and which is most prominently in the peaks seen in fig .",
    "[ f : oxygen ] ) is primarily due to dust emission .",
    "the difference between the relative brightness of these peaks ",
    "i.e.  at 100 @xmath15 m , the eastern peak is brighter , whereas at 60 @xmath15 m , the western peak is brighter  would then reflect different dust temperatures in the peaks , caused by differences in the strength and/or colour of the local radiation field . to estimate the mass of grains needed to account for the fir bump we nevertheless approximate the integrated emission in the bump as arising from either silicate or graphite grains at a single temperature , with optical properties given by laor & draine ( 1993 ) . the fir dust emission 60 and 100",
    "@xmath0 m was calculated  see table  [ t : fluxes ]  by subtracting from the observed flux densities the contributions due to line emission ( calculated from an average of the entries in table  [ t : isolws ] to be a fraction 0.08 and 0.07 of the total emission in the c60 and c100 filters , respectively ) and an extrapolation of the mir pure synchrotron power law ( @xmath16 jy , as derived from the isocam measurements of douvion et al .  in section  [ s : spectrum ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived dust flux densities are dominated by the uncertainties in the measured flux densities .",
    "table  [ t : fluxes ] also includes estimates of the synchrotron and dust emission at 170 @xmath0 m .",
    "the dust emission at 60 and 100 @xmath15 m is consistent with a small amount of warm dust ( @xmath2 m@xmath4 of silicate at temperatures around 45  k or @xmath3 m@xmath4 of graphite at temperatures around 50  k ) .",
    "the geometry of this warm dust emission is consistent with a torus of diameter @xmath5  pc , presumably created by the supernova progenitor .",
    "there is no evidence for dust emission towards the dark bays in the optical emission from the remnant in the east and west ( fesen , martin & shull 1992 ) .",
    "it should be emphasised that the main reason that the fir bump can be accounted for by such a moderate quantity of grains is the lack of any evidence for emission from cold dust in the 170  @xmath0 m band of isophot , which is the most sensitive of our measured bands for detecting grains with temperatures in the @xmath17  k range .",
    "our nominal estimate for the integrated flux density of the total dust emission at 170  @xmath0 m is @xmath18  jy , a number obtained by subtracting a synchrotron flux density estimated from an extrapolation of the long wavelength radio spectrum from the total measured flux density , and assuming line emission can be neglected in this band ( see table  [ t : isolws ] ) . at 170  @xmath0 m , the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail of the warm dust emission detected at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m is expected to contribute up to 14  jy , implying only @xmath19  jy might be attributable to cold dust , i.e.  at nearly the 3@xmath20 level , our observations are consistent with there being no cold dust in the nebula .",
    "a limit from any cold dust component of 3  jy at 170  @xmath0 m , assuming a grain temperature of 15  k , would correspond to upper limits of @xmath21 m@xmath22 and @xmath23 m@xmath22 from cold dust in the form of graphite and silicate , respectively ( for a distance of 2  kpc ) .",
    "these upper limits are however very crude , since the grain temperature of any cold dust is not well constrained by our data . moreover ,",
    "if the synchrotron spectrum is turning over at 170 @xmath0 m  as is suggested in section [ s:170and850 ] below  then the simple extrapolation of the synchrotron emission from larger wavelengths is likely to overestimate the synchrotron emission somewhat .",
    "a constraint on any cold dust arising from the positions of the warm dust emission peaks is provided by the almost identical morphology seen at 850  @xmath0 m and the 20  cm pure synchrotron image ( figs [ f:850 ] and [ f:20 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that at most @xmath21  jy of the 850-@xmath0 m emission can arise from cold dust at each peak , which corresponds to respective upper limits of @xmath24 m@xmath22 and @xmath25 m@xmath22 of graphite and silicate assuming a grain temperature of 15  k.      the isophot 170 @xmath0 m image shows a centrally brightened structure reminiscent of that seen at longer wavelengths ( i.e.  synchrotron emission ) , with no indication of the peaks seen at 100 and 60 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , detailed comparison of the 170 @xmath0 m image with the jcmt 850-@xmath0 m image , which we take to be synchrotron emission , does reveal differences in the details of the emission structure at these two wavelengths .",
    "[ f:850c170 ] shows the 850-@xmath0 m image smoothed to the resolution of the isophot 170 @xmath0 m image .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ f : iso160 ] shows that the peak of the 170-@xmath0 m emission ( near @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 ) , is displaced by about 40 arcsec to the south of the 850-@xmath0 m peak ( near @xmath32 @xmath27 @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath29 @xmath34 @xmath35 ) , which is much larger than any expected uncertainties in the positional accuracy of the images . moreover",
    ", the 170-@xmath0 m emission is relatively fainter in the nw compared with the expected extrapolation of the synchrotron emission from 850-@xmath0 m ( see fig .  [",
    "f : oxygen ] ) .",
    "one explanation of this , which would also explain the isophot 170 @xmath0 m flux density being low , is that the effect of a break in the synchrotron spectrum is becoming evident , but predominantly in the nw of the remnant , at wavelengths between 850 and 170 @xmath0 m .",
    "we note that the optical extent of the crab nebula agrees well with the radio extent of the remnant everywhere except in the nw ( see velusamy et al .  1984 ) , where the cm - wavelength radio emission extends beyond the optical emission .",
    "sankrit & hester ( 1997 ) note that there is no [ ] ` skin ' in the n and nw where the radio emission extends beyond the optical . generally is has long been recognised ( e.g.  woltjer 1987 ) that the extent of the synchrotron emission decreases with increasing frequency ( i.e.  energy ) , due to smaller lifetime of the more energetic particles responsible for the higher energy emission .",
    "however , it is not clear how to relate the deficit of the optical , _ thermal _ , emission to a spectral turnover at lower frequencies for the _ non - thermal _ synchrotron emission in the nw .",
    "one of the important results of this investigation is the discovery that the dust in the crab nebula is preferentially associated with the east  west chain of filaments seen predominantly in [ ] , lying just south of the position of the pulsar .",
    "this bears some resemblance to the situation in cas a , where mir emission from dust is seen from the [ ] -emitting fast optical filaments ( lagage et al .",
    "1996 ) , but contrasts with the situation in kepler s snr , where the mir emission appears to be associated with circumstellar dust ( douvion et al .",
    "these filaments are also helium - rich and have previously been hypothesised to be associated with circumstellar material responsible for the asymmetry in the north  south expansion of the nebula ( macalpine et al .",
    "1989 ; lawrence et al .  1995 ; fesen , shull & hurford 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the dust associated with these filaments may well also be of circumstellar origin .",
    "the isophot 60 and 100 @xmath0 m images reveal the extent and geometry of the dust - rich circumstellar matter in the nebula , showing it to be consistent with a torus of diameter @xmath1  arcsec ( or 0.8  pc for a distance of 2  kpc ) .",
    "this can be compared with the circumstellar ring around sn  1987a , which has also been shown to be a dust emission source ( fischera , tuffs & vlk 2002a ) , and which has a diameter of 1.3  pc . unlike the crab , which is thought to have had a red supergiant progenitor , the progenitor of sn  1987a was a blue supergiant star and left no detectable pulsar - powered nebula behind .",
    "the occurrence of quite similar structures associated with such different progenitors suggests that dusty circumstellar rings may be commonly associated with supernovae ( see also pozzo et al.2004 , who show evidence for circumstellar dust around sn 1998s ) .",
    "about half of the dust emission in the crab nebula can be attributed to the dust torus , and assuming that radiation fields illuminating the grains in the filaments are not strongly dependent on position within the nebula or on the chemical composition of the filament , about half of the total dust mass might be circumstellar in origin .",
    "we note however that , as in case of sn  1987a , the mass of dust in the circumstellar medium measured today could be much lower than that present prior to  1054 , due to evaporation of grains by the ultraviolet - flash from the supernova outburst and subsequent sputtering when the blast wave reached the circumstellar medium ( fischera , tuffs & vlk 2002b ) .",
    "this would also modify the grain size distribution by reducing the abundance of small grains in relation to large grains .",
    "tentative evidence for large grains sizes in comparison with typical interstellar grains is indeed provided from a comparison of the near - uv and optical obscuration in hst images ( blair et al .",
    "1997 ) , which shows that the extinction curve is rather flat .",
    "the remaining @xmath36 per cent of the dust emission can plausibly be identified as emanating from supernova condensates in the broadly distributed filaments distributed over the face of the nebula . however , the total mass of grains in condensates which can be inferred from our data is at most a few hundredths of a solar mass .",
    "comparison with the total mass of filaments of @xmath37 m@xmath4 ( mainly in the form of helium ) in the nebula ( fesen , shull & hurford 1997 ) indicates that the total dust - to - gas ratio in the nebula is in fact at most only of the same order as the interstellar value of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , even if the condensates seen at the present epoch could ultimately escape the remnant without being destroyed , the surrounding ism will not be significantly enriched in dust .",
    "in fact the supernova remnant may have the opposite effect ",
    "i.e.  to _ dilute _ the surrounding ism of grains .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the progenitors of events like that of  1054 are not significant sources of interstellar dust .",
    "our observations provide meaningful upper limits on the amount of carbon that can be ` hidden ' in grains in the nebula .",
    "the carbon abundance in the nebula is of particular importance to our understanding of the progenitor .",
    "carbon abundances in the gas phase show that the ejecta is helium rich , but not carbon rich , which places an upper limit are expected to dredge up freshly synthesised carbon from the core regions into the he - rich zone , e.g.  nomoto et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . ] on the progenitor mass of @xmath39 m@xmath4 when it was on the main sequence ( davidson et al.1982 ) .",
    "however , this estimate assumes that all the carbon is in the gas phase . in the extreme case that all the grains are made of graphite ,",
    "we infer a maximum mass of solid state carbon of @xmath6 m@xmath4 .",
    "this can be compared with the maximum possible amount of carbon present in the filaments if they had not been significantly enriched in carbon produced by nucleosynthesis in the star .",
    "assuming solar abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) this is a fraction 0.0022 of the @xmath40 m@xmath4 mass of the filaments , which is @xmath41 m@xmath4 .",
    "this mass is very close to our upper limit on the carbon mass of @xmath6 m@xmath4 which can be in the form of graphite .",
    "we therefore conclude that for the crab nebula we have found no evidence for a substantial boosting of the mass of carbon in the filaments through the presence of carbon in the solid state .      for a spectral index study of the synchrotron emission from the remnant ,",
    "the scuba image was compared with a vla image at 20  cm ( 1515  mhz ) , which was kindly supplied by michael bietenholz .",
    "the vla image is made from four arrays of vla data observed in 1987 ( see bietenholz & kronberg 1991 , bietenholz et al.1997 ) .",
    "for comparison with the scuba image , the vla image was : ( i ) scaled by 1.6 per cent in size , as is appropriate for a convergence epoch of 1233 for the expansion of the crab nebula ( bietenholz et al .",
    "1991 ) and the difference in epochs of the 850-@xmath0 m and 20-cm observations , and ( ii ) smoothed to a resolution of 17  arcsec to match that of the scuba image , see fig.[f:20 ] .",
    "( the flux density scale of the vla image was not changed , as the expected secular change between 1987 and 1999 is small ",
    "@xmath42 per cent  compared with the overall uncertainty in the flux density scales of the observations . ) the contour levels in figs  [ f:850 ] and [ f:20 ] have been chosen to be at similar relative levels .",
    "the 20-cm image is of higher quality , both in terms of its lower noise and the accuracy of the local baselevels .",
    "the close similarity between these images  which are at wavelengths that differ by a factor of _ over two hundred _  show that there is no strong spectral index variation across the remnant .",
    "hence , these results show that the particle populations responsible for the radio and sub - mm synchrotron emission are distributed very similarly within the crab nebula .    .",
    "contours are every 0.4 jy  beam@xmath43.[f:20],width=321 ]    an image of the spectral index between 20  cm and 850 @xmath0 m , is shown in fig.[f : alpha ] .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath8 , has been calculated where the 850-@xmath0 m emission exceeds 0.17 jy  beam@xmath43 .",
    "the random uncertainties in the derived spectral indices are dominated by the uncertainties in the 850-@xmath0 m image , not the 20-cm image . consequently a 850-@xmath0 m contour at @xmath44 jy beam@xmath43",
    "is also shown on fig.[f : alpha ] ( i.e.  at approximately eight times the variation in the background level of the scuba image , so the uncertainty in the derived spectral index is less than 0.02 inside this contour ) .",
    "these spectral indices are not absolute , as the flux density scales of the images are not themselves correct in an absolute sense ; a 10 per cent systematic shift in either of the flux density scales corresponds to a constant shift by 0.018 in the derived flux density .",
    "the spectral index over most of the crab nebula , particularly in regions of the brighter emission , shows very little variation , with the spectral index being typically between 0.29 and 0.33 , with no obvious systematic indication of spectral steepening towards the edge of the remnant . in comparison with bandiera et al.s results , fig .",
    "[ f : alpha ] is less noisy , and also covers a larger area , particularly to the sw .",
    "bietenholz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provide somewhat stronger limits on spectral variations of the radio emission across the crab nebula , but over a much narrower range of frequencies than for our results .    , of the crab nebula between 20  cm and 850 @xmath0 m ( see figs  [ f:850 ] and [ f:20 ] ) .",
    "contours , and discrete changes in the shading , are at 0.23 to 0.37 in steps of 0.02 ( with the higher spectral index values being darker ) .",
    "the spectral index is calculated only where the 850-@xmath0 m emission exceeds 0.17 jy beam@xmath43 . also shown",
    "is a single thick , black and white dashed contour of the 850-@xmath0 m emission , at 0.43 jy beam@xmath43.[f : alpha],width=321 ]    there is a slight general gradient of spectral index across the remnant , from the nw ( slightly flatter ) to the se ( slightly steeper ) .",
    "this gradient may be an artefact due either to : ( i ) a positional offset between the images , or ( ii ) different effective sampling of the large scale structure at 850-@xmath0 m compared to 20-cm .",
    "it is not thought possible that systematic uncertainties in the positions of the 850-@xmath0 m and 20-cm images could be large enough to produce spectral gradient seen .",
    "but , given the quite different observational techniques used at 850  @xmath0 m and 20  cm , the apparent small spectral index gradient across the remnant may well be due to differences in effective sampling of large - scale structures at the two wavelengths .",
    "however , if the spectral gradient is real , the variation may be due to differences in the spectra of the particles injected into the nw and se parts of the crab nebula from its central pulsar , or may reflect different environments ( e.g.  magnetic fields ) in the nw part of the crab nebula compared with the se . in x - rays  for example from recent chandra observations ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2000 )  there is also a nw to se asymmetry ( with the nw being brighter ) , indicating that there are differences in the energetic relativistic particles and magnetic fields responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "the main deviation in spectral index away from the large - scale gradient occur near the centre of the remnant  particularly near the position of the pulsar  where there are regions with slightly flatter spectra than their surroundings .",
    "the most pronounced region of flatter spectral index is about an arcmin in maximum extent , elongated ne to sw , centred on the crab s pulsar ( at @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 ) , with another somewhat smaller region of flatter spectrum emission slightly to the nw .",
    "these regions of flatter spectral index were also seen by bandiera , who interpreted them  along with their apparent excess in integrated flux density at 1.2  mm  as evidence for a second synchrotron component .",
    "although these regions of apparent flatter spectrum emission near the centre of the remnant may be indicative of real spectral variations , it must also be remembered that images used for the spectral comparison are from different epochs ( which also applies to bandiera et al.s comparison ) .",
    "instead the spectral variations near the centre of the remnant may reflect temporal variations .",
    "bietenholz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show clear variations in the structure of the radio emission from the crab nebula at 5  ghz in an region , @xmath49 arcmin@xmath50 in extent around the crab pulsar , aligned approximately ne to sw .",
    "this corresponds closely with the central region with the largest deviation in spectral index from the typical values seen in fig.[f : alpha ] .",
    "other deviations in spectral index , are regions showing flatter spectrum emission in the sw ( near @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath51 , @xmath46 @xmath30 , together with the region just to the ne centre of the remnant ( near @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath46 @xmath34 @xmath31 )  both also by bandiera et al .   and a region of steeper spectrum emission in the w ( near @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath52 , @xmath46 @xmath34 ) .",
    "overall there is little variation in spectral index over the face crab nebula , over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "however , unlike bandiera et al .",
    "we do not see the need to invoke an additional synchrotron component to explain the emission from the crab nebula , because : ( i ) we do not find any obvious excess in the integrated flux density of the crab nebula at 850-@xmath0 m , and ( ii ) the correspondence between the central region of flatter spectrum emission and that showing temporal variations implies that the apparent flatter spectral index may well be due to temporal variations .",
    "here we have presented fir and sub - mm images of the crab nebula , which we have used to investigate both thermal and non - thermal emission from this supernova remnant .",
    "the 60 and 100 @xmath0 m isophot observations show clear excess of emission above the extrapolated synchrotron radio spectrum at lower frequencies ( as has been see previously from _ iras _",
    "observations ) . with the improved angular resolution of the isophot images ,",
    "this excess is seen to come predominantly from two peaks , to the east and west of the centre of the remnant . from out studies of the lws spectra",
    "we have shown that this excess indicates the presence of a small amount of warm dust ( consistent with @xmath2 m@xmath4 of silicate at temperatures around 45  k or @xmath3 m@xmath4 of graphite at temperatures around 50  k ) in the remnant .",
    "the distribution of this dust is consistent with a torus of diameter @xmath5  pc created by the supernova progenitor prior to its explosion , superimposed upon a broadly distributed component which may be supernova condensates in the filaments .",
    "since the dust - to - gas ratio in the filaments is comparable to the interstellar value , even if the condensates seen at the present epoch could ultimately escape the remnant without being destroyed , the surrounding ism will not be significantly enriched in dust .",
    "our upper limit of @xmath6 m@xmath4 on the total mass of carbon in the form of graphite is consistent with the inference from the gas - phase carbon abundances that there has been no significant synthesis of carbon in the progenitor during its lifetime .",
    "the lower resolution 170 @xmath0 m isophot image does not show any excess emission , but instead is possibly fainter , particularly in the nw , than expected from an extrapolation of the lower - frequency radio synchrotron spectrum .",
    "these , and other observations , are consistent with the synchrotron spectrum becoming gradually steeper throughout the fir spectral range covered by the isophot observations .",
    "the flux density of the crab nebula from scuba 850-@xmath0 m observations is consistent with an extrapolation of radio synchrotron spectrum from lower frequencies .",
    "comparison of the 850-@xmath0 m image with a 20-cm vla image shows there is little variation in spectral index across the face of the remnant between these wavelengths .",
    "although there are some spectral variations near the centre of the remnant , as has been seen previously , we do not see the need for the second radio synchrotron component , such as that proposed by bandiera et al .",
    "we are grateful to s.  lawrence and m.  bietenholz for making available their [ ] and 20-cm images of the nebula in [ ] , and to d.  pierce - price and j.  richer and for help and advice with the mem processing of the jcmt data .",
    "the isophot data presented in this paper were reduced using p32tools , a pht32 processing and transient correction program developed at the max - planck - institut fr kernphysik , and incorporated into pia ( the interactive analysis package for isophot ) by the iso data centre of the esa research and scientific support department in collaboration with the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) .",

    "<S> these findings are consistent with a picture in which the fir excess is due to emission from a small amount of warm dust ( in the ranges @xmath2 and @xmath3 m@xmath4 for astronomical silicate and graphite , respectively ) which radiates predominantly at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m micron but not at 170 @xmath0 m , and which is superimposed on a synchrotron spectrum which gradually steepens towards shorter wavelengths throughout the fir and mir spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> the dust geometry is consistent with a torus of diameter @xmath5  pc created by the ( red supergiant ) supernova progenitor prior to its explosion , superimposed upon a broadly distributed component which may be supernova condensates in the filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the dust - to - gas ratio in the filaments is comparable to the interstellar value . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even if the condensates seen at the present epoch could ultimately escape the remnant without being destroyed , the surrounding ism will not be significantly enriched in dust . </S>",
    "<S> our upper limit of @xmath6 m@xmath4 on the total mass of carbon in the form of graphite is consistent with the inference from the gas - phase carbon abundances that there has been no significant enrichment of the filaments in carbon nucleosynthesis products from the progenitor . to study spectral index variations in the radio synchrotron emission </S>",
    "<S> we compared the 850-@xmath0 m image with a 20-cm vla image . </S>",
    "<S> these images are very similar , implying that there is little variation in spectral index across the face of the remnant between these wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> as seen previously , there are some spectral variations near the centre of the remnant . but given the good agreement between the integrated flux density at 850  @xmath0 m and the extrapolated synchrotron spectrum , together with the different epochs of the 850-@xmath0 m and 20-cm images , we do not see the need for the second radio synchrotron component from the remnant , which has previously been proposed .    </S>",
