    "modulation in the form of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) or discrete multi - tone ( dmt ) has recently emerged as a preferred candidate for a wide variety of wired and wireless communication systems .",
    "it has been used in wireless local area networks [ 1 ] , in digital subscriber line services [ 2 ] , in optical communications [ 3 ] and is a major contender for fifth generation mobile networks [ 4 ] .",
    "one of the major disadvantages of ofdm is the high crest - factor of the time - domain ofdm waveform . to avoid in - band and out - of - band distortions",
    ", the ofdm signal requires power amplifiers with large back - offs , which results in reduced power efficiency .",
    "several approaches are used to deal with the crest - factor problem in ofdm systems . the simplest method to reduce the crest - factor of an ofdm signal is to apply memoryless nonlinearity , such as clipping , to the ofdm waveform before amplification in a transmitter .",
    "this approach allows significant crest - factor reduction , but introduces unwanted in - band distortion components .",
    "conventional receivers treat the distortion component as a noise and thus they suffer from bit error rate ( ber ) degradation [ 5 ] .",
    "decision - feedback nonlinear distortion compensation schemes [ 6 , 7 ] can partially compensate for ber degradation ; however , due to the error propagation effect , they are only suitable for weak nonlinear distortions .    in [ 8 ] , the authors theoretically demonstrated that the ber performance of multicarrier transmission subjected to strong memoryless nonlinearity can outperform linear transmission provided that an optimal maximum - likelihood ( ml ) receiver is used .",
    "unfortunately , an ml receiver for nonlinearly distorted multicarrier signals with a realistic number of subcarriers has enormous complexity . in [ 9 ] , several sub - optimal bit - flipping receivers that can approach ml - performance were proposed .",
    "however , the complexity of such receivers grows exponentially with the number of subcarriers and modulation order , and as a result this approach quickly becomes infeasible even for computer simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a practical receiver for multicarrier signals subjected to a strong memoryless nonlinearity .",
    "the receiver design is based on a generalized approximate message passing ( gamp ) framework [ 10 ] , and it allows real - time algorithm implementation in software or hardware with moderate complexity .",
    "we demonstrate that the proposed receiver can provide more than a 2db gain compared with an ideal uncoded linear ofdm transmission at bers @xmath0 in the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , when the ofdm signal is subjected to clipping nonlinearity and the crest - factor of the clipped ofdm waveform is only 1.9db .",
    "let us consider the system model depicted in figure 1 . in the transmitter , @xmath1 complex baseband",
    "@xmath2-qam modulation symbols are transformed into the time domain via the real inverse discrete fourier transform ( idft ) operation and then the cyclic prefix ( cp ) is added to each @xmath3-point signal block .",
    "finally , the signal is passed through a memoryless nonlinearity block .",
    "the signal at the receiver input can be expressed as :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a memoryless nonlinear function , @xmath6 is the channel impulse response with length @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the awgn term with zero mean and variance @xmath9 , and    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the complex @xmath2-qam baseband symbols ( @xmath13 to avoid dc - bias ) .",
    "note that due to cp insertion @xmath14 , if @xmath15 .    in the sequel , we consider the following clipping nonlinearity model :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a threshold value .",
    "note that nonlinearity is applied to a nyquist - sampled signal @xmath18 ; therefore , all distortion components fall in - band and no out - of band emission is introduced .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the real - valued ofdm signal , sometimes called a dmt signal , and cartesian - type clipping nonlinearity .",
    "nonetheless , the results and main conclusions presented in this paper are also applicable to complex ofdm signals and other types of nonlinearity with the saturation effect .    system model ]    _ assumptions _ : we assume that ( a ) the receiver knows the type of nonlinear transfer function @xmath5 , ( b ) the receiver can perfectly estimate the channel response @xmath19 , and ( c ) the length of channel impulse response is shorter than the cyclic prefix duration ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in the awgn channel ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) , the model of the received signal can be simplified to    @xmath24    we can also express @xmath25 as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a real @xmath28 idft ( unitary ) matrix with elements :    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    model ( 4 ) is equivalent to a general problem formulation for the gamp algorithm [ 10 ] , which belongs to a class of gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation ( bp ) for dense graphs . in our receiver implementation , we use the sum - product variant of the gamp algorithm that approximates the minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) estimates of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the gamp algorithm adapted to our problem is summarized below .",
    "the algorithm generates a sequence of estimates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , for @xmath35 through the following recursions :    _ step 1 ) initialization : _",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39    _ step 2 ) estimation of output nodes : _    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    where    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    _ step 3 ) estimation of input nodes _ :    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    @xmath2 is the number of points in the signal constellation , and @xmath52 is the vector of constellation points per real or imaginary component , e.g. for 4-qam modulation @xmath53 $ ] and for 16-qam @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the steps ( 7)-(17 ) are repeated with @xmath55 until @xmath56 iterations have been performed . at each iteration , we calculate the euclidean distance between the received vector @xmath57 , and reconstructed time - domain waveform @xmath58 , and the final decision is based on vector @xmath59 that corresponds to the minimum euclidean distance @xmath60 :    @xmath61    it should be noted that the integrals in ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) can be expressed in closed - form using the tabulated gauss error functions .",
    "however , due to the complexity of closed - form expressions , we omit them here for clarity . in practice ,",
    "( 9)-(11 ) can be approximated using several simple look - up tables .      with the addition of",
    "the multipath channel , the system model ( 1 ) deviates from a classical gamp estimation problem .",
    "there is an additional channel sub - graph connecting nonlinear nodes @xmath62 and observable nodes @xmath63 .",
    "an optimal solution would be to incorporate the channel sub - graph into a message passing receiver structure .",
    "however , in this paper , we resort to a sub - optimal , yet computationally simpler approach .",
    "namely , we introduce a channel pre - processing step :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the dft of @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the dft of the channel impulse response @xmath68 , @xmath69 denotes hadamard product , and @xmath70 denotes hadamard ( element - wise ) inversion .",
    "after such a pre - processing step , we can apply gamp algorithm ( 7)-(17 ) to the signal @xmath71 , which now can be expressed as    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the gaussian distributed , but non - white noise sequence .",
    "note that we rely here on our assumption that the channel impulse response length is shorter than the cp duration , which allows us to model the linear convolution of @xmath74 with the channel impulse response @xmath19 as a cyclic convolution .",
    "one can easily observe that ( 20 ) is essentially a well - known zero - forcing linear equalization operation .",
    "this approach is clearly sub - optimal since the gamp receiver operating on @xmath71 ignores the correlation of noise components in @xmath73 .",
    "nonetheless , it permits low - complexity receiver implementation and demonstrates very good performance in typical multipath scenarios , as will be illustrated in the next section .",
    "one of the advantages of the gamp - based receiver is its moderate computational complexity .",
    "in fact , the complexity of algorithm ( 7)-(17 ) is dominated by the matrix transforms in ( 8) and ( 15 ) , which can be computed efficiently via fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "thus , the complexity of the proposed receiver is of order @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the number of iterations .",
    "this compares favorably with the complexity of maximum - likelihood receiver and sub - optimal receivers in [ 9 ] .",
    "overall , the receiver complexity per iteration is comparable with that of the iterative distortion cancellers [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "the performance of the proposed decoding algorithm has been studied by means of monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we simulated an uncoded ofdm system with 2048 complex subcarriers ( @xmath3=4096 ) and 4-qam and 16-qam modulation with gray mapping .",
    "the variance of @xmath77 was normalized to 1 . for comparison , we also include here the results for a conventional ofdm receiver and an iterative distortion canceller that attempts to estimate and compensate for the uncorrelated nonlinear distortion term ( so called , bussgang noise ) using a decision - directed approach [ 6 , 7 ] . in all our simulations ,",
    "the maximum number of iterations ( @xmath56 ) was set to 30 .",
    "however , it should be noted that when the ber is less than @xmath78 the average number of iterations required for convergence is typically less than 5 .",
    "the results for the awgn channel are illustrated in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "performance of the proposed receiver in awgn channel ( 4-qam , @xmath3=4096 ) ]    performance of the proposed receiver in awgn channel ( 16-qam , @xmath3=4096 ) ]    as can be seen from the results presented in figure 3 , the clipped 4-qam ofdm signal without any forward error - correction coding provides @xmath79 db gain compared with the _ ideal _ uncoded linear transmission at ber=@xmath0 if the clipping threshold is set to @xmath80 ( this value of @xmath17 corresponds to a clipped waveform crest - factor around 1.9 db ) .",
    "the performance gain can be as high as 2.5 db at ber=@xmath81 when @xmath82 . at lower clipping ratios ( @xmath83 ) ,",
    "the gamp - based receiver does not converge at practically interesting values of @xmath84 . at higher values of the clipping threshold ( @xmath85 )",
    "the performance improvement at low bers is less dramatic , but the water - fall region starts at lower values of @xmath84 , which results in slightly better performance at ber around @xmath86 .    a less remarkable , but still significant , performance gain ( > 1 db at ber=@xmath87 ) can also be achieved by a gamp - based receiver in the case of 16-qam modulation ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in the 16-qam case the gamp - based receiver does not converge at threshold values @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "lower threshold values lead to a better theoretical performance [ 8 ] , therefore , the convergence of message passing receivers for nonlinearly distorted ofdm signals in the case of very strong nonlinear distortions is still an open issue .",
    "performance of the proposed receiver in frequency selective channel ( 4-qam , @xmath3=4096 , @xmath17=0.8 ) ]    finally , in figure 4 we illustrate the performance results for the gamp - based receiver with a channel pre - processing step ( 20 ) in the frequency - selective multipath channel .",
    "the channel profile was generated randomly from distribution @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the frame length was set to @xmath91 , the duration of the cp was set to @xmath92 .",
    "the results show that the proposed receiver can achieve around @xmath93 db gain in such multipath channels even with sub - optimal channel equalization processing ( 20 ) .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a practical gamp - based receiver for multicarrier signals subjected to strong memoryless nonlinearity .",
    "we demonstrated that the proposed receiver can provide more than a 2db gain compared with the _ ideal _ linear ofdm transmission at a ber range @xmath0 in the awgn channel .",
    "note that at the same time , the crest - factor of the nyquist - sampled ofdm waveform is reduced from ~12db to only 1.9db as a result of clipping .",
    "the simulation results also show that the proposed receiver provides significant performance gain in frequency - selective multipath channels . due to this fact , we believe that , in some applications , uncoded clipped ofdm systems combined with the proposed receiver structure",
    "can compete with coded ofdm systems .",
    "the complexity of the proposed receiver is moderate and is suitable for practical implementation in software or hardware .",
    "the extension of the proposed receiver structure to coded ofdm systems and the full utilization of the graph structure for severe frequency - selective multipath channels is a possible venue for future research .",
