    "it has been known for a long time that in certain mass regions nuclei with static deformation show deviations from a rigid axially symmetric picture .",
    "the possibility of static triaxial shapes for the ground state of nuclei is a long - standing problem in nuclear structure physics despite the fact that very few candidates have been found experimentally @xcite,@xcite . in the geometrical approach the triaxial nuclear properties",
    "are usually interpreted in terms of either the @xmath4unstable ( or @xmath4soft ) rotor model of wilets and jean @xcite or the rigid triaxial rotor model of davydov _ et al .",
    "these models exploit the geometrical picture of nucleus according to the collective model ( cm ) of bohr and mottelson , expressed in terms of the intrinsic variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 where the former specifies the ellipsoidal quadrupole deformation and the latter the degree of axial asymmetry .",
    "to describe the deviations from axial symmetry the model of wilets and jean assumes that the potential energy is independent of the @xmath6-degree of freedom , while in the model of davydov _ et al .",
    "_ one considers a harmonic oscillator potential with a minimum at finite values of @xmath6 producing a rigid triaxial shape of the nucleus .",
    "recently , analytical solutions of the bohr hamiltonian regarding the triaxial shapes using a davidson potential @xcite and a sextic oscillator @xcite have been obtained , where the triaxial shapes are assumed from the very beginning .",
    "the former , called @xmath7 solution , is shown to cover the region between a triaxial vibrator and the rigid triaxial rotator , while the @xmath8 solution corresponds to the critical point of the shape phase transition from a triaxial vibrator to the rigid triaxial rotator .",
    "triaxiality has been also studied in the framework of the algebraic collective model @xcite , and the onset of rigid triaxial deformation has been considered @xcite .",
    "an alternative description of nuclear collective excitations is provided by the ibm , which in contrast to the geometrical models , is of an algebraic nature . to accommodate the triaxial shapes in the ibm",
    ", several approaches can be adopted .",
    "it was shown that the triaxial shapes can occur in three different cases :    \\(i ) in the ibm-1 framework , in which no distinction between protons and neutrons is made , the inclusion of higher - order ( three - body ) terms is needed @xcite,@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) in the sdg - ibm framework ( using s , d , and g bosons ) , the presence of the @xmath9 boson also suffices @xcite , @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) in the ibm-2 framework , in which protons and neutrons are used as distinct entities , the inclusion of one - body and two - body terms suffices @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in the ibm-1 framework",
    "the triaxial shapes are usually obtained by adding three - body terms of the type @xmath10^{(l ) } \\cdot [ \\widetilde{d}\\widetilde{d}\\widetilde{d}]^{(l)}$ ] ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . these terms generate a relatively broad region of triaxiality in the parameter space of the hamiltonian . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that by adding to the consistent - q formalism hamiltonian a cubic combination @xmath11 of the most general quadrupole operator @xmath12 coupled to zero angular momentum , called the cubic consistent - q hamiltonian , there exist a very tiny region of triaxiality around @xmath13 between the prolate and oblate phases .",
    "the @xmath14 cubic term is interpreted as a correction to the quadrupole - quadrupole scalar product , which in combination with the latter can generate stable triaxial shapes .",
    "the study of the effects of various multipole interactions within the framework of the sdg - ibm on the equilibrium shape of the ground state in deformed nuclei has revealed that a hexadecapole interaction involving a g - boson is needed in order to induce a triaxial shape . over the years",
    ", both microscopic and phenomenological evidence has been gathered that shows the importance of the g - boson in deformed regions . including the @xmath9 boson , in a recent study in the sdg - ibm no shape or phase transitions toward stable triaxial shapes",
    "was found @xcite .",
    "an important feature offered by the ibm-2 @xcite is the possibility to get triaxial shapes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite besides the axially symmetric ones only taking into account explicitly the proton - neutron degrees of freedom or the two - fluid character of the nuclear system .",
    "the triaxial shapes then arise as a result of different deformations of the proton and neutron fluids .",
    "the microscopic conditions leading to two - fluid triaxial structure are found when the proton bosons are particle like ( i.e. below mid - shell ) and the neutron bosons are hole - like ( above mid - shell ) or vice versa .",
    "a new critical point @xmath15 symmetry @xcite from axially deformed to triaxial shapes was proposed and suggested to be of importance of considering triaxial shapes in the phase diagram of the ibm-2 .    in the present paper",
    "we exploit an algebraic approach , complementary to ibm , for the description of triaxial nuclei and show how within the framework of the phenomenological interacting vector boson model ( ivbm ) one might obtain triaxial shapes .",
    "the ivbm and its recent applications for the description of diverse collective phenomena in the low - lying energy spectra ( see , e.g. , the review article @xcite ) exploit the symplectic algebraic structures and the sp(12,@xmath16 ) is used as a dynamical symmetry group .",
    "symplectic algebras have been applied extensively in the theory of nuclear structure .",
    "they are used generally to describe systems with a changing number of particles or excitation quanta and in this way provide for larger representation spaces and richer subalgebraic structures that can accommodate the more complex structural effects as realized in nuclei with nucleon numbers that lie far from the magic numbers of closed shells .",
    "the symplectic symmetries emerge as appropriate dynamical symmetries for the many - body theory of collective motion , considering the nucleus from a hydrodynamic perspective @xcite .",
    "for example , the one - fluid symplectic model of rowe and rosensteel @xcite , based on the non - compact dynamical algebra @xmath17 , allows for the description of rotational dynamics in a continuous range from irrotational to rigid rotor flows .",
    "the extension of the @xmath17 symplectic model to the case of two - fluid nuclear systems leads naturally to the @xmath18 dynamical symmetry . in this respect",
    "the symplectic ivbm can be considered as a generalization of the symplectic model of rowe and rosensteel ( contained as a submodel of the @xmath18 ivbm ) , when the nuclear many - body system is viewed as consisting of two different interacting subsystems .",
    "the different shapes that take place within the framework of the two - fluid ivbm have been investigated in ref .",
    "it has been shown that there exist three distinct shapes corresponding to the three dynamical symmetries of ivbm:(1 ) spherical shape , @xmath19 , ( 2 ) @xmath4unstable deformed shape , @xmath2 , and ( 3 ) axially deformed shape , @xmath20 .",
    "it turns out that these are not all possible shapes associated with the algebraic structures of the ivbm that might arise .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the ivbm possesses a very rich phase structure , which also contains , beyond the spherical and axially deformed shapes , triaxial shapes . for this purpose",
    "we propose a new dynamical symmetry limit of the ivbm , which in some aspects is related to the one of the dynamical symmetries of the ibm-2 , namely the @xmath1 one .",
    "the @xmath1 limit of ibm-2 has been discussed extensively in refs . @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the latter gives rise to the dieperink tetrahedron @xcite , which has an extra dimension compared to the casten triangle @xcite , and to a new , triaxial shape phase of the model .",
    "it has been shown in the literature that the exact @xmath1 symmetry possesses a large degeneracy in the level spectra which in actual nuclei is not observed and hence the @xmath1 symmetry probably does not appear in its pure form and must be perturbed . in many cases ,",
    "the energy spectra exhibit transitional patterns and might be situated in between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 or @xmath21 and @xmath1 dynamical limits . in this respect ,",
    "we study the influence of different types of perturbations on the @xmath1 dynamical symmetry energy surface of the ivbm .",
    "it is shown that the newly proposed dynamical symmetry limit might be of relevance for the description of the collective properties of different nuclei exhibiting triaxial features .",
    "it was suggested by bargmann and moshinsky @xcite that two types of bosons are needed for the description of nuclear dynamics .",
    "it was shown there that the consideration of only two - body system consisting of two different interacting vector particles will suffice to give a complete description of @xmath22 three - dimensional oscillators with a quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the latter can be considered as the underlying basis in the algebraic construction of the _ phenomenological _ ivbm .",
    "the algebraic structure of the ivbm @xcite,@xcite,@xcite is realized in terms of creation and annihilation operators of two kinds of vector bosons @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , which differ in an additional quantum number @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 and @xmath28)@xmath29the projection of the @xmath30spin ( an analogue to the @xmath31spin of ibm-2 or the @xmath32spin of the particle - hole ibm ) . in the present paper , we consider these two bosons just as elementary building blocks or quanta of elementary excitations ( phonons ) rather than real fermion pairs , which generate a given type of algebraic structures .",
    "thus , only their tensorial structure is of importance and they are used as an auxiliary tool , generating an appropriate _ dynamical _ symmetry .",
    "these elementary excitations carry an angular momentum @xmath33 , i.e. they transform as vectors with respect the rotational group @xmath34 . in this regard ,",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bosons of the ibm-1 can be considered as bound states of elementary excitations generated by the two vector bosons .",
    "the microscopic foundation of the ivbm is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "( a short discussion on this matter can be found in ref.@xcite . ) nevertheless , some remarks concerning this topic can be very useful for the readers who are not familiar with the ivbm .",
    "it is known that the ibm is now standard and the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bosons are viewed as working approximations of the composite @xmath37 and @xmath38 bosons made up of nucleons held together by the pairing and the quadrupole forces .",
    "additional degrees of freedom are further incorporated in the extended versions of the model ( e.g. the inclusion of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath9 bosons ; the inclusion of the isospin , the f - spin and the particle - hole i - spin ) . in this respect , the natural question about the connection between the ivbm and the standard versions of ibm arises .",
    "the answer is obtained @xcite by means of the boson mapping technique , which is widely applied to the problems of microscopic foundation of ibm @xcite .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the ivbm boson space can be mapped on the ideal boson space of ibm including beyond the standard @xmath35 and @xmath36 bosons ( ibm-1 ) , also the @xmath39 bosons . the latter ( together with the @xmath40 bosons )",
    "are shown to play a crucial role in the description of the deformed asymmetric shapes in nuclei , in which the octupole and dipole ( cluster ) degrees of freedom must be taken into account .",
    "this specific version of ibm is denoted as ibm-3.5 ( intermediate between ibm-3 and ibm-4 ) .",
    "the interaction between these secondary @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath39 bosons is induced by the interaction between the vector bosons .",
    "a similar situation occurs also in the specific isospin - invariant version of the fermion dynamical dymmetry model @xcite applied to the sd - shell nuclei , in which the states constructed from the nucleon pairs are built from two p - objects ( @xmath41 ) , as well as in the ivbm .",
    "the introduction of a p - boson ( p - object ) in nuclei with mixed quadrupole - octupole deformation has been pointed out by many authors , including also microscopic considerations @xcite , @xcite . the need for the p - boson has been suggested by schematic shell - model calculations @xcite , in which collective pairs of both positive ( @xmath37- and @xmath38-pairs ) and negative parity ( @xmath42- and @xmath43-pairs ) are used as building blocks .",
    "the @xmath39-boson has been introduced in different studies of clustering phenomena in nuclei as well , where the dipole degrees of freedom are connected with the relative motion of the clusters @xcite .    in the most general case the two - body model hamiltonian",
    "should be expressed in terms of the generators of the group @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the non - compact `` symplectic dynamical symmetry limits '' ( subgroup chains starting with some of the symplectic subalgebras of @xmath18 ; see refs.@xcite,@xcite ) , in some special cases the two - body model hamiltonian can be written in terms of the generators of the subgroups of the maximal compact subgroup @xmath44 only .",
    "the following lattice of group - subgoup chains of @xmath18 takes place ( excluding the `` symplectic limits '' , given in @xcite,@xcite ) :    @xmath45    compared to the lattice given in ref .",
    "@xcite , here a new reduction chain ( the last one in eq.([chains ] ) ) is considered .",
    "as it can be seen , the ivbm has a very rich algebraic structure of subgroups .",
    "the first three dynamical limits of the ivbm given in eq.([chains ] ) and the geometries corresponding to them are considered in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concentrating on the last reduction chain of the dynamical symmetry group @xmath18 of the ivbm for studying the triaxiality in atomic nuclei .",
    "as we will see throughout the paper , this dynamical symmetry is appropriate for nuclei in which the one type of particles is particle - like and the other is hole - like .",
