    "in recent days random walks in dynamic random environments have been studied by several authors .",
    "motivation comes among others from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ",
    "derivation of fourier law[@xcite ] and large deviation theory [ @xcite ] . in principle ,",
    "random walks in dynamic random environments contain , as a particular case , a random walk in a static random environment .",
    "however , mostly , in turning to dynamic environments , authors concentrate more on environments with sufficient mixing properties . in that case",
    "the fact that the environment is dynamic helps to obtain self - averaging properties that ensure standard limiting behavior of the walk , that is , the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem .    in the study of the limiting behavior of the walker , the environment process , that is , the environment as seen from the position of the walker plays a crucial role .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite for the use of the environment process in related context . in a translation invariant",
    "setting , the environment process is a markov process and its ergodic properties fully determine corresponding ergodic properties of the walk , since the position of the walker equals an additive function of the environment process plus a controllable martingale .",
    "the main theme of this paper is the following natural question : if the environment is uniquely ergodic , with a sufficient speed of mixing , then the environment process shares similar properties . in several works [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] this transfer of `` good properties of the environment '' to `` similar properties of the environment process ''",
    "is made via a perturbative argument , and therefore holds only in a regime where the environment and the walker are weakly coupled .",
    "some nonperturbative results also exist , but those require strong mixing properties of the environment in space and time [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "in this paper we consider the context of general markovian uniquely ergodic environments , which are such that the semigroup contracts at a minimal speed in a norm of variation type .",
    "examples of such environments include interacting particle systems in `` the @xmath0 regime '' [ @xcite ] and weakly interacting diffusion processes on a compact manifold .",
    "our conditions on the environment are formulated in the language of coupling .",
    "more precisely , we impose that for the environment there exists a coupling such that the distance between every pair of initial configurations in this coupling decays fast enough so that multiplied with @xmath1 it is still integrable in time . as a result",
    "we then obtain that for the environment process there exists a coupling such that the distance between every pair of initial configurations in this coupling decays at a speed which is at least integrable in time .",
    "in fact we show more , namely in going from the environment to the environment process , we essentially loose a factor @xmath1 in the rate of decay to equilibrium .",
    "for example , if for the environment there is a coupling where the distance decays exponentially , then the same holds for the environment process ( with possibly another rate ) .",
    "once we have controllable coupling properties of the environment process , we can draw strong conclusions for the position of the walker , for example , a law of large numbers with an asymptotic speed that depends continuously on the rates , and a central limit theorem .",
    "we also prove recurrence in @xmath2 under condition of zero speed .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and necessary notation are introduced in section [ sectionmodel ] .",
    "section  [ sectionep ] is dedicated to lift properties of the environment to the environment process .",
    "the focus is on theorem  [ thmep - estimate ] and its refinements .",
    "based on these results consequences for the walker are summarized in section [ sectionconsequences ] . in section  [ sectionexamples ]",
    "we give examples for environments to which the results are applicable and present one example which has polynomial mixing in space and time .",

    "a random walk in dynamic random environment is a process @xmath3 on the lattice @xmath4 which is driven by a second process @xmath5 on @xmath6 , the ( dynamic ) environment .",
    "this is interpreted as a random walk moving through the environment , with time - dependent transition rates being determined by the local environment around the random walk .    to become more precise , the _ environment _ @xmath7 we assume to be a feller process on the state space @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a compact metric space ( examples in mind are @xmath10 or @xmath11 $ ] ) .",
    "we assume ( without loss of generality ) that the distance @xmath12 on @xmath13 is bounded from above by 1 .",
    "the generator of the markov process @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath14 and its semigroup by @xmath15 , both considered on the space of continuous functions @xmath16 .",

    "a weaker semi - norm we also use is the oscillation ( semi)-norm @xmath31 from telescoping over single site changes one sees @xmath32 .",

    "notice that this process is meaningful only in the translation invariant context .      in the remainder of the paper",

    "consists of two copies of the environment , started in @xmath21 and @xmath57 . by definition , a  coupling has the marginals @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the canonical filtration in the path space of coupled processes .",
    "we say such a coupling satisfies the marginal markov property if , for any @xmath24 , @xmath61 = s_{t - s}^e f\\bigl(\\eta^i_s\\bigr),\\qquad i=1,2 ; t\\geq s \\geq0.\\ ] ] we say it satisfies the strong marginal markov property if , for any @xmath24 and any stopping time @xmath62 , @xmath63 = { \\mathbh{1}}_{t\\geq\\tau } s_{t-\\tau}^e f",

    "in order to conclude results for the random walk , we need to have sufficient control on the environment . to this end",
    "we assume there exists a translation invariant coupling @xmath53 of the environment , which satisfies the strong marginal markov property ( [ eqsmmp ] ) . in this coupling",
    "we look at @xmath64 , measuring the distance of the states at the origin .",
    "if this decays sufficiently fast we will be able to obtain ergodicity properties of the environment .",
    "[ assumption1a ] the coupling @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66    this assumption is already sufficient to obtain the law of large numbers for the position of the walker and unique ergodicity of the environment process , but it does not give quite enough control on local fluctuations .",

    "[ assumption1b ] the coupling @xmath65 satisfies @xmath67    typically , a coupling which satisfies assumption  [ assumption1b ] also satisfies assumption  [ assumption1a ] .",

    "in section  [ sectionexamples ] we will discuss some examples which satisfy those assumptions . beside natural examples where @xmath71 decays exponentially fast ,",
    "we give an example where other decay rates like polynomial decay are obtained .",

    "we generalize this result to give more information about decay in time . here",
    "we continue with results we can obtain using theorem  [ thmep - estimate ] .",
    "most results about the environment process just use part ( a ) of the theorem ; part ( b ) shows how more sophisticated properties lift from the environment to the environment process as well .",
    "those can be necessary to obtain more precise results on the walker , like how likely atypical excursions from the expected trajectory are .",
    "it is possible to lift other properties from the environment to the environment process as well .",
    "for example , if assumption  [ assumption1b ] is modified to state @xmath77 then that implies for the environment process @xmath78 this kind of condition can be relevant in the context of diffusive environments to show that small changes in the environment are causing only small changes in the environment process .",

    "we already know that under assumption  [ assumption1a ] the environment process has a unique ergodic distribution .",
    "however , we do not know at what speed this process converges to its unique stationary measure .",
    "given the speed of convergence for the environment it is natural to believe that the environment process inherits that speed with some form of slowdown due to the additional self - interaction which is induced from the random walk .",

    ", we will construct a class of environments which we call _ layered environments_. one can think of layered environments as a weighted superposition of a sequence of ( independent ) environments .",
    "those kind of environments are fairly natural objects to study .",
    "one area where they can appear is an idealization of molecular motors . in molecular motors the walker moves ( e.g. ) in a potential , where the potential randomly switches between various global states [ e.g. , related to chemical transitions in the example of kinesine ; see @xcite for more motivation ] .",

    "layered environments could also appear from a multi - scale analysis of a complicated environment , where the layers with a high index represent the long - range interactions .",
    "besides , layered environments are a useful tool because they form a class of environments which are uniformly mixing with arbitrary mixing speed .",
    "there are plenty of examples where one has polynomial or stretched exponential mixing , for example , in the context of diffusion processes .",

    "we focus on layers which still have exponential decay of correlations , but each layer does converge to its stationary measure at a layer specific rate @xmath158 , with @xmath159 being the index of the layer .",
    "when @xmath158 tends to 0 as @xmath160 this introduces some form of arbitrary slow decay of correlations .",
    "we counterbalance this by weighting the superposition in such a way that the individual influence of a layer goes to 0 as well .",
    "note that such a counterbalancing is only possible because of the lipschitz nature of the assumptions .",
    "a uniform decay estimate does not hold because of the arbitrary slow decay in deep layers .    more formally , for each @xmath153 let @xmath161 be a markov process on @xmath162 , the environment on layer @xmath159 .",

    "the layer decay ( [ eqlayerdecay ] ) and the choice of distance ( [ eqstackdistance ] ) then provide the following decay of coupling distance for the layered environment : @xmath174 the sum on the right - hand side of ( [ eqstackdecay ] ) can have arbitrary slow decay depending on @xmath175 .",
    "for example , if one fixes @xmath176 , then @xmath177 leads to decay of order @xmath178 .",
    "we did not specify the exact nature of the individual layers , as those did not matter for the construction .",

    "the idea is now to use a coupling @xmath219 similar to the one in proposition  [ propcoupling - construction ] .",
    "the coupling contains as objects two copies of the environment , @xmath266 and @xmath267 , and three random walks , @xmath268 and @xmath227 .",
    "the random walk @xmath226 moves on the environment @xmath269 with rates @xmath270 , and correspondingly the random walk @xmath227 moves on @xmath267 with rates  @xmath271 . the mixed walker @xmath272 moves on the environment @xmath267 as well , but according to the rates @xmath37 .",
    "the walkers @xmath273 will perform the same jumps as @xmath272 with maximal probability . this can be achieved with the same construction as in proposition  [ propcoupling - construction ] , but with poisson clocks @xmath208 which have rates @xmath274 .",
    "we only consider the case where all three walkers start at the origin .",
    "we denote by @xmath275 , @xmath276 the semigroups of the environment process which correspond to the rates @xmath37 and @xmath271 .",
    "let @xmath277 .",
    "@xmath278          by construction of the coupling , @xmath293 stochastically dominates @xmath287 .",
    "as we have @xmath294 it follows that @xmath295 .",
    "using this fact together with the monotonicity of @xmath280 in ( [ eqpsit ] ) , @xmath296 as @xmath297 by lemma  [ lemmadecoupling - estimate ] we can iterate this estimate until it terminates after @xmath298 steps .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath299 the integral is estimated by telescoping over single site changes and lemma  [ lemmasupnorm - coupling - estimate ] in the usual way , yielding @xmath292    to finally come back to the original question of continuity , @xmath300 by sending @xmath271 to @xmath37 , the right - hand side tends to 0 so that the ergodic measure of the environment process is indeed continuous in the rates @xmath37 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that both @xmath286 and @xmath301 are rather explicit given the original coupling of the environment .",
    "notably when @xmath95 , that is , the rates do not depend on the environment , @xmath96 and @xmath302 .",
    "a first fact is that the conditions for ( a ) and ( b ) imply assumptions [ assumption1a ] and  [ assumption1b ] . in the adaptation of the proof for part ( a ) , in most lines it suffices to add a @xmath303 to the integrals",
    "however , in line ( [ eqphi-1 ] ) , we use @xmath304 to obtain the estimate @xmath305 instead . thereby in lines ( [ eqphi-2 ] ) , ( [ eqphi-3 ] ) and ( [ eqphi-4 ] ) we have to change @xmath306 to @xmath307 .",
    "this change then leads to the replacement of @xmath308 by the term @xmath309 in the lines ( [ eqphi-5 ] ) and ( [ eqphi-6 ] ) [ where naturally @xmath310 becomes @xmath311 .",
    "so all we have to prove that for sufficiently big @xmath312 , @xmath313 in a first step , we show that @xmath314    as we already saw in the proof of lemma [ lemmadecoupling - estimate ] , we can view the event of decoupling as the first jump of a poisson process with time - dependent and random rates [ equation ( [ eqdynamic - rate - poisson ] ) ] .",
    "hence we have @xmath315 by telescoping over single site discrepancies and using lemma [ lemmasupnorm - coupling - estimate ] , this is less than @xmath316 by assumption .",
    "since @xmath317 decreases to 1 as @xmath318 , monotone convergence implies @xmath319 by lemma  [ lemmadecoupling - estimate ] .",
    "consequently , there exists a @xmath320 such that for all @xmath104 , @xmath321 this completes the adaptation of part ( a ) .",
    "the adaptation of the proof of part ( b ) follows the same scheme , where we add the term @xmath303 to all integrals .",
    "note that this gives a version of  lemma  [ lemmatriplenorm - coupling - estimate ] as well .",
    "then , in line ( [ eqphi-7 ] ) we use ( [ eqphik - factor ] ) again and then have to replace @xmath306 by @xmath322 in lines ( [ eqphi-8 ] ) and ( [ eqphi-9 ] ) . to estimate ( [ eqphi-9 ] ) , we use=-1 @xmath323=0 with @xmath324 as in the original proof .",
    "therefore @xmath325 which is finite by lemma [ lemmatriplenorm - coupling - estimate ] .",
    "proof of proposition  [ proplln ] the lln for @xmath326 follows directly by ergodicity . to prove the lln for @xmath46 we use a slight modification of the coupling @xmath219 in proposition  [ propcoupling - construction ] .",
    ". that @xmath327 ( otherwise look at @xmath328 ) . in the construction of the modified coupling @xmath329",
    "we look at @xmath330 .",
    "jump events of @xmath330 we call decoupling events , which are events when one walker jumps but the other does not .",
    "up to the first decoupling the coupling @xmath331 is identical to @xmath332 . by lemma",
    "[ lemmadecoupling - estimate ] , there is at least probability @xmath333 uniformly in @xmath21 to never decouple . at the instant @xmath62 of a decoupling event we restart the coupling @xmath65 of the environment .",
    "this is done in the configuration @xmath334 .",
    "that is , instead of coupling @xmath335 with @xmath336 , we match @xmath337 with @xmath338 .",
    "this allows us to apply lemma  [ lemmadecoupling - estimate ] a second time , since for the purpose of decoupling events , both walkers start at the origin at time @xmath62 . iterating",
