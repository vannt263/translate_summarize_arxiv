    "in the last couple of years the classification of matter states from a topological point of view has attracted a lot of interest .",
    "@xcite originally , this approach has been introduced to gain a better understanding for the robustness of the hall conductivity of the two - dimensional electron gas in the quantum hall regime @xcite .",
    "in contrast to quantum hall systems , in topological insulators time reversal symmetry is fulfilled and they exhibit a strong spin orbit coupling leading to an inverted band structure . due to the bulk - boundary correspondence principle ,  @xcite three - dimensional topological insulators such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 or sb@xmath0te@xmath1 show topologically protected surface states , rendering them robust against perturbations that are not breaking the time reversal symmetry . in the long - wavelength limit the two - dimensional electron states at the surface can be described as massless dirac electrons with the peculiar property that the spin is locked to the momentum , thereby forming a helical electron gas . thus , charge transport is closely intertwined with spin transport , which renders these systems interesting for spintronic applications . in particular collective charge - density waves ( plasmons ) in a helical liquid are always accompanied by spin - density waves , so - called `` spin - plasmons '' ,  @xcite which might be utilized in spin accumulator devices .",
    "@xcite    the surface states of the topological insulator reveal unique properties if an energy gap is induced in the dispersion by breaking the time reversal symmetry on the surface , e.g. , by applying a perpendicular external magnetic field or by the proximity of magnetic materials . under this condition ,",
    "a surface quantum hall current with a half - integer quantized hall conductivity arises , leading to an intriguing topological magneto - electric effect @xcite , in which an in - plane electric field induces an antiparallel magnetization and analogously a charge polarization is induced by a magnetic field .",
    "this effect can be accounted for by modified constituent equations , or more generally by a field theory including a @xmath2-term in the electrodynamic lagrangian . in systems with time - reversal symmetry",
    ", @xmath3 is quantized with @xmath4 or @xmath5 @xmath6 for the topologically trivial and nontrivial case , respectively .    as regarding the modified maxwell equations , it is interesting to study electromagnetic properties at interfaces of media with abruptly changing @xmath3 values",
    ". shining polarized light onto a topological insulator leads to a small kerr and faraday effect , i.e. , to a rotation of the light polarization when reflected or transmitted through a topological insulator film .",
    "@xcite however , the angles are not universal and depend on the optical constants of the involved media . to separate the bulk contribution , a combined measurement of the kerr and faraday angles has been proposed to find universal results depending only on the quantized @xmath3-value .  @xcite interestingly , in thin layers of topological insulators a  giant  kerr angle of @xmath7 has been predicted , due to the interference of multiple reflections as in a fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "@xcite recent experiments confirm such large magneto - optical effects in thin layers of topological insulators .",
    "@xcite    also the electromagnetic properties of surface plasmons in topolgical insulators become modified by the topological magneto - electric effect .",
    "as shown by karch  @xcite the polarization of the surface plasmons is rotated from the transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode into the transverse electric ( te ) direction by a small angle on the order of the fine structure constant @xmath8 . in this work ,",
    "the author has considered an interface between an insulator and a doped topological insulator , with the fermi energy lying in the bulk conduction band , and the residual bulk charge density has been described as a drude gas with negative permittivity @xmath9 . the drude gas then allows to fulfill the usual condition for surface plasmon modes .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we investigate surface plasmons in topological insulators in the case where the fermi - energy lies _ inside _ the bulk gap of the topological insulator , which means that the only free charges are dirac - electrons on the surface , and the bulk contribution is completely described by its static dielectric constant ( which is typically very large , around 4080 , for bi@xmath0x@xmath1 binary compounds ) .",
    "we develop the methodology for the classical electromagnetic fields of surface plasmons , with the quantum properties of the helical dirac gas being included via its dielectric function , and compute the surface plasmon dispersion for realistic material systems . in agreement with karch",
    ",  @xcite we find that the effect of the additional @xmath10 term in the lagrangian has practically no influence on the surface plasmon dispersion , which is almost completely governed by the dielectric properties of the two - dimensional electron gas , but leads to a mixing of te and tm field components .",
    "this gives rise to a rotation of the magnetic polarization of surface plasmons out of the interface plane , which could be directly detected in experiment .",
    "in this section we derive the dispersion relation for surface plasmons at the planar interface between a topological insulator and a dielectric .",
    "our analysis closely follows the standard procedure for surface plasmons  @xcite that has been recently extended to topological insulators .",
    "@xcite however , contrary to the work of karch ,  @xcite we treat the topological insulator as a true insulator that has a finite conductivity only at its surface .",
    "@xcite the structure under study thus consists of ( i ) the topological insulator ( dielectric constant @xmath11 ) for @xmath12 , ( ii ) the surface of the topological insulator ( two - dimensional conductivity @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 , and ( iii ) a dielectric material ( dielectric constant @xmath15 ) for @xmath16 . the two - dimensional conductivity is computed for free electrons with a dirac - like dispersion , similar to the case of graphene  @xcite ( for details see discussion below ) .      due to hall currents at the surface of the topological insulator ,",

    "become    @xmath50    with @xmath51 . to simultaneously satisfy the two equations relating the te and tm amplitudes",
    ", we find the plasmon condition for topological insulators @xmath52 note that for normal dielectrics with @xmath53 and @xmath54 this expression yields the usual surface plasmon conditions .",

    "@xcite to obtain the dispersion , we ( i ) use the light dispersion @xmath39 to express @xmath55 in terms of the parallel momentum @xmath56 and the light frequency @xmath37 ; for evanescent fields , the sign of @xmath55 has to be chosen such that the waves decay exponentially away from the interface . for a given parallel wavenumber @xmath56 , we then ( ii ) scan over frequencies @xmath37 in order to find those values where the plasmon condition of eq .   is fulfilled . within our computational approach",

    "quite generally , @xmath46 can be related to the current - current correlation function ,  @xcite which , within the random - phase approximation , only depends on the genuine electron - gas properties ( without any coulomb couplings ) .",
    "however , to connect to the literature results  @xcite we will first compute the dielectric function @xmath57 for a two - dimensional electron gas embedded in a dielectric background with constant @xmath58 , and will then extract the optical conductivity from @xmath57 .",
    "this procedure assumes a specific dielectric environment for the calculation of @xmath57 , but finally extracts the conductivity part which depends on the genuine electron gas properties only ( all coulomb coupling effects are properly included in our electrodynamic approach described above ) .",
    "we start from ohm s law @xmath59 . with the fourier - transformed expressions for the continuity equation @xmath60 and the electric field",
    "@xmath61 , we can relate the induced charge distribution to the potential , @xmath62 on the other hand , we can also use the dynamic polarization  @xcite @xmath63 to relate these quantities through @xmath64 .",
    "the dynamic polarization is related to the dielectric function according to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the coulomb potentials for a three- or two - dimensional fourier transform , respectively .",
