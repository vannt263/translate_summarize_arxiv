    "understanding the dynamics of fusion reactions at very low energies is essential to understand the nature of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "these reactions are measured at laboratory energies and are then extrapolated to thermal energies .",
    "this extrapolation is usually done by introducing the astrophysical s - factor : @xmath0 \\ , \\label{sig1}\\ ] ] where the sommerfeld parameter , @xmath1 is given by@xmath2 here @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electric charges and the relative velocity of the target and projectile combination , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath6is introduced to separate the exponential fall - off of the cross - section due to the coulomb interaction from the contributions of the nuclear force .",
    "the latter is represented by the astrophysical s - factor which is expected to have a very weak energy dependence .",
    "the form given in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) assumes that the electric charges on nuclei are `` bare '' .",
    "however , neither at very low laboratory energies , nor in stellar environments this is the case . in stars the bare coulomb interaction between the nuclei",
    "is screened by the electrons in the plasma surrounding them .",
    "a simple analytic treatment of plasma screening was originally given by salpeter  @xcite .",
    "in most cases of astrophysical interest salpeter s treatment still remains to be a sufficient approximation @xcite . in the very low energy laboratory experiments the bound electrons in the projectile or the target may also screen the coulomb potential as the outer turning point gets very large ( 500 fm ) . as experimental techniques",
    "improve one can measure the cross section in increasingly lower energies where the screened coulomb potential can be significantly less than the bare one .",
    "this deviation from the bare coulomb potential should manifest itself as an increase in the astrophysical s - factor extracted at the lowest energies .",
    "this enhancement was indeed experimentally observed for a large number of systems @xcite .",
    "the screening effects of the atomic electrons can be calculated @xcite in the adiabatic approximation at the lowest energies and in the sudden approximation at higher energies with a smooth transition in between @xcite",
    ".    in the adiabatic approximation one assumes that the velocities of the electrons in the target are much larger than the relative motion between the projectile and the target nuclei . in this case",
    ", the electronic cloud adjusts to the ground - state of a `` molecule '' consisting of two nuclei separated by a time - dependent distance @xmath7 , at each time instant @xmath8 since the closest approach distance between the nuclei is much smaller than typical atomic cloud sizes , the binding energy of the electrons will be given by the ground - state energy of the @xmath9 atom , @xmath10 .",
    "energy conservation implies that the relative energy between the nuclei increases by @xmath11 .",
    "this energy increment increases the fusion probability .",

    "the velocity of the atomic electrons is comparable to the relative motion between the nuclei .",
    "thus , a dynamical calculation has to be done for the effect of atomic screening @xcite .",
    "however , the screening potential @xmath14 obtained from a dynamical calculation can not exceed that obtained in the adiabatic approximation because the dynamical calculation includes atomic excitations which reduce the energy transferred from the electronic binding to the relative motion .",
    "contributions from the nuclear recoil caused by the atomic electrons are expected to further increase the screening effect for asymmetric systems @xcite . in almost all the cases",
    "observed screening effects are found to be equal to or more than the theoretical predictions . recently including improved energy loss data for atomic targets",
    "is shown to lead agreement between theory and data @xcite , however the situation is still not resolved for molecular and solid targets .",
    "electron screening enhancement was not observed for the heavier symmetric system @xmath18 @xcite which is expected to have about 20% enhancement at the energies studied .",
    "recent measurements @xcite have not yet clarified the effects of electron screening in this reaction .",
    "a mechanism which reduces the screening enhancement for this system ( and possibly for other systems with large values of @xmath19 and the reduced mass ) seems to be needed .    in this article",
    "we show that the contributions from the polarization of the vacuum , relativity , bremsstrahlung , and atomic polarization can not achieve this task .",
    "the motivation for this investigation is that @xmath20 appears multiplied by a large number , @xmath1 in the exponential factor of eq .",
    "one needs only a small value of @xmath14 to obtain a sizeable enhancement factor ; typically @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite for subbarrier fusion reactions using the formalism developed by uehling @xcite .",
    "effects of vacuum polarization in @xmath22scattering at 4 mev was subsequently experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "other small effects in elastic scattering at low energies have also been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "they have also been studied in the context of astrophysical reactions in refs .",

    "the atomic screening potential , assumed to be a constant function of @xmath31 ( valid for @xmath32 ) , is given by @xmath14 .",
    "vacuum polarization * increases * the electromagnetic potential between two like charges . like the coulomb potential itself ,",
    "the increase due to vacuum polarization is also proportional to the product of the charges @xcite .",
    "vacuum polarization contribution increases almost exponentially as the two charges get closer .",
    "the coulomb interaction is smaller for asymmetric systems than for symmetric systems of comparable size . on the other hand",
    ", the nuclear force tends to extend farther out for asymmetric systems because of the extra neutrons .",
    "consequently for asymmetric systems the very tail of the nuclear force can turn the relatively weak coulomb potential around to form a barrier at a considerable distance from the nuclear touching radius . for symmetric systems , however , the location of the barrier is further inside where the vacuum polarization contribution is stronger .",
    "we show that the resulting increase in vacuum polarization is nevertheless not sufficiently large to make an appreciable contribution to the extracted astrophysical s - factor . for light symmetric systems with small values of @xmath19",
    "this effect should be negligible .",
    "indeed , for the @xmath33 reaction the vacuum polarization contribution was shown to be very small @xcite .",
    "similarly the measured s - factor for the @xmath34 reaction @xcite agrees well with theoretical calculations of atomic screening @xcite . on the other hand one may expect that already for the @xmath18 reaction the increase in the potential due to the vacuum polarization could be large enough to counter the decrease due to electron screening .",
    "we show that this is not the case .                    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the modified bessel functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 as well the integral over @xmath42 can be expanded in a very useful series in chebyshev polynomials which converge rapidly and for practical purposes only a few terms @xmath44 is needed , allowing a very fast and accurate computation of the uehling potential .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the coulomb potential and the vacuum polarization potential for @xmath45 .",
    "both the coulomb potential and the screening potential scale with the product @xmath19 .",
    "however , the vacuum polarization potential has a stronger dependence on the nuclear separation distance .",
    "the limits of the integral are the nuclear radius , @xmath46 where the nuclear fusion reaction occurs , and the classical turning point in the coulomb potential , @xmath47 where @xmath48 at very low energies the inferior limit @xmath49 is not important when vacuum polarization is neglected ( the exponential factor in eq .",

    "( 2.1 ) ) .",
    "however , since the vacuum polarization potential has a strong dependence on the nuclear separation distance , being much stronger at shorter distances , its effect is very much dependent on the choice of this parameter . for all reactions with the deuteron we use the `` deuteron radius '' , @xmath52 @xmath53 corresponding to an average distance value associated with matrix elements involving the deuteron . for the other reactions we use @xmath49 values given in the third column of table i. in the 4th row",

    "we see that the effect of vacuum polarization is small , but non - negligible for some reactions .",
    "moreover , it increases the discrepancy between the value of the screening potential required to explain the experimental data and the theoretical calculations of this potential as illustrated in table i.                  the correction due to relativity is given in the 6th column of table i. although the correction in the momentum @xmath64 is of the order of @xmath65 , the penetrability is enhanced by an amount of order of @xmath66 as compared to the penetrability with only the coulomb interaction .          where @xmath70 and the direction of observation @xmath71 .",

    "( 2.21 - 2.24 ) , also for heavier atoms , we find the corrections due to atomic polarizability presented in the two last rows of table i. we see that atomic polarizability is more important for monopole excitations .",
    "the reasoning here is the same as in the use of the adiabatic approximation for the effect of electron screening : the monopole field of the combined @xmath118 atom is stronger than the monopole field of the @xmath119 atom .",
    "thus , the contribution of the monopole term dominates over other multipolarities",
    ". however , its effect on the fusion cross section is still small .",
    "this agrees with the hypotheses used in the dynamical calculations @xcite of atomic screening that effects due to atomic excitations , and particularly for virtual excitations , are small and can be neglected .      in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the vacuum polarization , relativistic corrections , bremsstrahlung , and atomic polarization contributions to the astrophysical s - factor never exceed a few percent , but may be significant in extrapolating the measured s - factor to lower energies .",
    "although these contributions are not comparable to that of sub - threshold resonances and electron screening , they represent some of the many factors that may contribute to the weak energy dependence of the s - factor .",
    "nuclear polarization effects , were not included , since they are much smaller than effects due to atomic polarization , for light targets .",
    "vacuum polarization effects are the most important from all small contributions , and sensitive to the inner turning point of the potential barrier , hence to the diffuseness of the nuclear potential employed .",
    "although the energy needed to create a virtual @xmath120 -pair is much larger than atomic excitation energies , the magnitude of its effect is greatly compensated by its large matrix element ( due to the large overlap of the electron and positron wavefunctions ) , contrary to the atomic polarization cases .",
    "for the same reason , nuclear polarization and excitation should be neglected .",
    "we have shown in this work that none of the corrections beyond the effect of atomic screening can explain the missing enhancement of the fusion cross sections in atomic target experiments . as suggested in ref .",
