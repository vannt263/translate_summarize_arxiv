    "chaos synchronization has exhibited an increasing interest in the last decade since the pioneering works reported in @xcite , and it has been advocated as a powerful tool in secure communication @xcite .",
    "chaotic systems are indeed characterized by a great sensitivity to the initial conditions and a spreading out of the trajectories , two properties which are very close to the shannon requirements of confusion and diffusion @xcite .",
    "there are basically two approaches when using chaotic dynamical systems for secure communications purposes .",
    "the first one amounts to numerically computing a great number of iterations of a discrete chaotic system , in using e.g. the message as initial data ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the second one amounts to hiding a message in a chaotic dynamics .",
    "only a part of the state vector ( the `` output '' ) is conveyed through the public channel .",
    "next , a synchronization mechanism is designed to retrieve the message at the receiver part ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    in both approaches ,",
    "the first difficulty is to `` build '' a chaotic system appropriate for encryption purposes . in this context",
    ", the corresponding chaotic signals must have no patterning , a broad - band power spectrum and an auto - correlation function that quickly drops to zero . in @xcite , a mean for synthesizing volume - preserving or volume expanding maps",
    "is provided .",
    "for such systems , there are several directions of expansion ( stretching ) , while the discrete trajectories are folded back into a confined region of the phase space .",
    "expansion can be carried out by unstable linear mappings with at least one positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "folding can be carried out with modulo functions through shift operations , or with triangular , trigonometric functions through reflexion operations . fully stretching piecewise affine markov maps",
    "have also attracted interest because such maps are expanding in all directions and they have uniform invariant probability densities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "besides , we observe that the word `` chaotic '' has not the same meaning everywhere , and that the chaotic behavior of a system is often demonstrated only by numerical evidences . the first aim of this chapter is to provide a rigorous analysis , based on the definition given by devaney @xcite , of the chaotic behavior of a large class of affine dynamical systems defined on the homogeneous space associated with a regular tiling of @xmath0 .",
    "classical piecewise affine chaotic transformations , as the _ tent map _ , belong to that class .",
    "the dimension @xmath3 may be arbitrarily large in the theory developed below , but , for obvious reasons , most of the examples given here will be related to regular tilings of the plane ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the study of the subclass of ( time - invariant or switched ) affine systems on @xmath2 , the @xmath1dimensional torus , is done in @xcite .",
    "the folding for this subclass is carried out with modulo maps , which , from a geometric point of view , amounts to `` fold back '' @xmath0 to @xmath5 by means of translations by vectors in @xmath6 .",
    "those translations are replaced here by all the isometries of some crystallographic group for an arbitrary regular tiling of @xmath0 .",
    "notice also that the fundamental domain used in the numerical implementation may be chosen with some degree of freedom .",
    "it may be a hypercube ( as @xmath5 for @xmath2 ) , or a polyhedron , or a more complicated bounded , connected set in @xmath0 .    for ease of implementation and duplication , a cryptographic scheme must involve a map for which the parameters identification is expected to be a difficult task , while computational requirements for masking and unmasking information are not too heavy .",
    "the second aim of this chapter is to show that all these requirements are fulfilled for the class of dynamical systems considered here .",
    "the way of extracting the masked information is provided through an observer - based synchronization mechanism with a finite - time stabilization property .",
    "let us now describe the content of the chapter .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the chaotic properties of the following discrete dynamical system @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and ( mod @xmath10 ) means roughly that @xmath11 is the point in the fundamental domain @xmath12 derived from @xmath13 by some transformation @xmath14 in the group @xmath10 .",
