    "let us stress that nollet s and neff s approaches and the present one are  for technical reasons  based on three different @xmath9 interactions .",
    "they are thus not supposed to give the same results and , in fact , both absolute values of the astrophysical @xmath2 factors and their energy dependence differ significantly .",
    "to get some insights on these differences , the @xmath77 contributions to the @xmath0 astrophysical @xmath2 factors obtained in this work are decomposed into the different partial waves and compared with neff s results  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ decomp ] .    because of the absence of the centrifugal barrier , the transitions from the @xmath86 partial wave ( @xmath92 ) are the most important and those are the ones for which we find the largest difference",

    "although the approach is restricted to two - nucleon forces , a rather good description of @xmath7 and @xmath6 nuclei is obtained .",
    "theoretical and experimental @xmath10 and @xmath11 elastic phase shifts do not agree perfectly well . however , the discrepancy is difficult to characterize because of the lack of knowledge on the experimental uncertainties .",
    "new experimental studies of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 elastic scattering would be highly desirable to probe more accurately the quality of the scattering wave functions . at low energies ,",
    "the theoretical @xmath4-wave phase shifts are overestimated by our approach .",
    "this has a direct impact on the energy dependence of the astrophysical @xmath2 factor at low energies , which is therefore not exactly reproduced .",
    "the overestimation of the @xmath4-wave phase shifts is mostly due to the adjustment of the nucleon - nucleon interaction for reproducing the @xmath7 and @xmath6 binding energies without three - nucleon forces with the largest considered model space .",
    "taking the three - nucleon forces into account could thus reduce this discrepancy .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of three - body forces would reduce the dependence of renormalization of the inter - nucleon interactions on the results , which would enable us to consider softer interactions , leading to a faster convergence . including the three - body interactions",
    "is thus the next step in the development of an _ ab initio _ approach of radiative - capture reactions .",
    "however , this a particularly challenging task , which requires analytic developments and large computational efforts .",
