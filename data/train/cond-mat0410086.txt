    "furthermore noise enables brownian motors to do work against external load forces @xcite , or to induce phase transitions far away from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on the role of phase synchronization in stochastic overdamped systems driven by white gaussian noise . in these cases ,",

    "we shall take a closer look at the synchronization phenomenon in a periodically driven bistable system .",
    "then it is advantageous to introduce a discrete phase dynamics , as recently proposed by schimansky - geier and collaborators @xcite . in order to extract this discrete phase dynamics from the underlying continuous process",
    ", we shall consider the stochastic counting process of the noise - induced switches between the two potential minima .",
    "it turns out that this counting process is in fact a non - stationary renewal process  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the present work is as follows : first , we introduce a dichotomic process by filtering out the fluctuations around the potential minima of the original stochastic process , which possesses a clear interpretation in terms of a discrete phase .",
    "by contrast to the underlying stochastic process , this two - state process , however , is no longer markovian .",

    "iii , we analyze in detail the statistical properties of the random switching - times associated to the dichotomic process .",

    "iv . based on these results , exact analytical expression for the instantaneous output frequency and the phase diffusion are derived .",

    "finally , our analytical findings will be applied to the case of a symmetric bistable potential driven by a periodic rectangular input signal . to corroborate our analytical results ,",
    "we compare them with those obtained from a numerical simulation of the original stochastic process .",

    "with this work we have investigated in detail the phenomenon of frequency and phase synchronization in bistable , periodically driven stochastic systems .",
    "this objective is not only of foremost interest for the well known phenomena of stochastic resonance @xcite and the topic of rocked brownian motors @xcite but also carries great potential for the study of driven stochastic neuronal dynamics and driven excitable sytems per se @xcite .",
    "our approach takes a new look on this prominent problem . starting out from a driven",
    ", markovian continuous dynamics we derived in great detail the stochastic renewal dynamics of the noise - induced switching events .",
    "this contraction of the full markovian dynamics in state space onto the discrete counting process of subsequent switches between the metastable states implies a non - markovian dynamics for the switching times and the corresponding phase dynamics whose explicit time - evolution depends on initial preparation effects . the resulting non - markovian expressions still contain the full information of the driven dynamics in the relevant state space and thus are not readily accessible for analytical estimates .",
    "in contrast , for weak noise and slow external driving , the dynamics of the underlying process simplifies considerably .",
    "consequently , in the long time limit the phase dynamics now assumes again a markovian nature . in this regime",
    "we put forward new results for the phase diffusion and the frequency synchronization . in doing so ,",
    "we have employed rectangular - shaped periodic driving signals .",
    "this choice entails two distinct advantages , namely ( i ) it allows a convenient analytic analysis of the corresponding synchronization quantities and ( ii ) its two - state character is also known to optimize the efficiency for the synchronization features .",
    "the same optimization feature holds true for related effects such as the achievements of optimizing the gain for stochastic resonance @xcite or the enhancements of energy transduction in driven chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "our analysis is in the spirit of prior works @xcite ; our novel estimates , however , quantitatively supersede in accuracy those prior results , cf . the detailed comparison performed above .",
    "while the improvement for the frequency synchronization is moderate only , the novel estimates present a sizable improvement for the role of the phase diffusion . in the weak - noise regime and for slow external driving",
    ", the markovian theory provides a very good agreement with numerical precise simulations .",
    "this being so , we are confident that the new insight gained into the complexity of non - markovian , driven switching time dynamics together with its markovian simplification obtained at weak noise and slow driving will prove useful for modelling and interpreting stochastic synchronization phenomena in driven metastable and excitable dynamics .",
