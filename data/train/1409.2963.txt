    "blazars comprise a subclass of radio - loud active galactic nuclei that consist of bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "these objects show flux and polarization variability on diverse time scales across the entire electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum ( ulrich et al 1997 ) . according to the current paradigm",
    ", blazars have supermassive black holes at their centers that accrete material and produce relativistic jets that happen to be oriented close to our line of sight ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the observed spectra of blazars are dominated by nonthermal radiation produced by relativistic electrons spiraling around the magnetic fields in relativistic jets ( blandford & rees 1978 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars have two broad humps in the log@xmath3 vs log@xmath4 representation ( ghisellini et al .",
    "the low energy sed hump peaks in a frequency ranging from sub - mm to soft x - ray bands is well explained by synchrotron emission from an ultra - relativistic electron population residing in the magnetic fields of the approaching relativistic jet ( e.g. , maraschi et al .",
    "1992 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ; hovatta et al .  2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the high energy sed hump that peaks in the mev  tev gamma - ray bands , is usually attributed to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of photons off those relativistic electrons .",
    "depending on the peak frequency of synchrotron hump , @xmath5 , blazars are often further classified into three categories : low synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) blazars have @xmath6 hz , intermediate - synchrotron - peaked ( isp ) have @xmath7 hz , and high synchrotron - peaked ( hsp ) blazars have @xmath8 hz ( abdo et al .",

    "we have studied the optical / uv and x - ray band variability of bl lac pks @xmath0 which is a hsp .",
    "pks @xmath0 was one of the first recognized bl lacs ( schwartz et al .",
    "1979 , hewitt & burbidge 1980 ) and is the brightest object in uv to tev energies in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the redshift of pks @xmath0 is @xmath9 as determined by optical spectroscopy of the galaxies in the bl lac field ( falomo et al .",
    "this object has been studied on many occasions in single and multiple bands of the em spectrum to search for variability , cross - correlated variability , seds and other properties of the source on diverse timescales ( e.g. , shimmins & bolton 1974 ; carini & miller 1992 ; urry et al .",

    "chadwick et al .  ( 1999 ) detected for the first time very high energy gamma - ray photons from this source using the durham mk 6 telescope and thus classified it as a tev blazar .",
    "there also are more recent claims of tev emission from this source ( abramowski et al .",

    "simultaneous multi - band observations of the source from optical to x - ray bands using xmm - newton data were reported by zhang et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2006b ) . zhang ( 2008 ) found that the synchrotron emission of pks 2155 - 304 peaked in the uv - euv bands rather then the soft x - ray band .",

    "more recently , stronger evidence for a @xmath10 4.6 hr qpo in this source on one occasion in xmm - newton observations was reported ( lachowicz et al .",

    "although the @xmath17 values have decreased significantly when compared to the @xmath17 values in the case of the log - parabolic best model fits , these models are still not statistically acceptable for any of the 20 sed .",
    "examples of the quality of the model fits are also shown in fig .",
    "the solid lines in the upper right hand panel in this figure indicate the best - fit pllp models to the seds that are plotted in the same panel , and in the right lower panels of the same figure we plot the respective best - fit residuals .",
    "this time , the best - model fits do not over - predict the uv spectra at low frequencies , but the x - ray band residuals display a  wavy \" pattern .",
    "this is the result of the fact that the model does not fit well the x - ray data above @xmath18 hz . the @xmath17 values decrease even more , although the reduced @xmath17 values increase significantly in some cases .",
    "a major reason for this is the extremely small error bars in the optical / uv part of the spectra .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy between the best - fit model and the observed seds ( i.e. the ratio `` ( data - model)/data '' ) is of the order of @xmath10 5% in the uv band , and even smaller in the x - ray band ( except from the @xmath19 hz region , where we observe discrepancies of the order of @xmath20 % in all spectra ) , even in the case of the seds with the highest @xmath17 values .",
    "in fact , if we assume that the error of the sed points in all cases is equal to 5% of the sed values    these reduced @xmath17 values improve even more but are still not statistically acceptable .",
    "a major reason for this is the extremely small error bars ( especially in the optical / uv part of the spectra ) .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy between the best - fit model and the observed seds ( i.e. the ratio  data / model \" ) is of the order of @xmath21% in the uv band , and even smaller in the x - ray band ( except from the @xmath19 hz region , where we observe discrepancies of the order of @xmath20 % in all spectra ) .",
    "in fact , if we assume that the error of the sed points in all cases is equal to 5% of the sed values , then the best - fit models to all spectra are now acceptable ( with reduced @xmath17 values of the order of @xmath22 ) . in this case , we can also estimate the 1-@xmath23 error for the best - fit parameter values .",
    "these errors are indicated in * table 3 * by the numbers in the parentheses next to the best - fit results in the case of the sed fits up to the @xmath24 hz .",
    "we used the pllp best - fit results to investigate correlations between the best - fit model parameters and the observed uv and soft x - ray count rates .",
    "4 shows plots of the best - fit model parameters with the observed uvw1 and 0.62 kev count rates ( left and right panels , respectively ) . to quantify the correlation we used both the frequently used pearson s @xmath25 as well as the non - parametric kendall s @xmath26 .",
    "only the model normalization ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) is positively correlated with the uv flux ( see lower left panel in fig .  4 ) .",
    "the correlation is statistically significant , and rather strong : pearson s @xmath25 is 0.84 ( @xmath27 ) and the probability that this value appears by chance is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . in order to emphasize even more the correlation between the model normalization and the uv flux , the solid line in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "4 indicates a straight line with a slope of unity .",
    "this is not the best fit to the data plotted in the same panel , but we plot it there in order to indicate that such a line appears to describe well the relation between the data plotted .",
    "therefore , the uv flux variations could indeed be , to a large extent , proportional to the model normalization variations ; i.e .. to a first approximation , the uv flux is simply responding to the model normalization variations , without being affected by the other model parameter changes .    on the other hand , @xmath11 does not correlate significantly with the soft x - ray flux ( and neither does any of the other best - fit model parameter values ) . in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "4 we also plot the one - to - one line .",
    "there may exist a rough positive correlation between the two quantities , but both pearson s @xmath25 and kendall s @xmath26 imply that this correlation is not statistically significant .",
    "this result explains the lack of correlation we observe between the uv and x - ray fluxes ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "while the uv flux responds mainly to the model normalization , the x - ray flux must also be significantly affected by spectral shape variations as well ( i.e. variations of @xmath2 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "we also investigated the correlations within the model parameters .",
    "the only significant correlations that we found are those between @xmath31 ( the turn - over frequency which corresponds to @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( pearson s @xmath34 , kendall s @xmath35 , and p@xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ) and between @xmath38 and @xmath2 ( @xmath39 p@xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively ) .",
    "5 shows a plot of @xmath42 and @xmath2 versus @xmath38 .",
    "our results indicate that flatter and more curved spectra are associated with higher turn - over frequencies .    the upper panel in fig .",
    "6 shows a plot of the model curvature @xmath2 as a function of @xmath43 ( the frequency at which the maximum power is emitted ) .",
    "not surprisingly , given the correlation between @xmath38 , @xmath42 , and @xmath2 , the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath43 are also strongly correlated .",
    "the correlation is positive , in the sense that as the peak power increases , the spectral curvature increases as well .",
    "the dashed line in the same panel indicates the best - fit line to the data ( in the log  log space ) .",
    "the fit has been performed using the  ordinary least - squares bisector \" method of isobe et al .",
    "the best - fit result indicates that : @xmath44 .",
    "the error on the best - fit slope value indicate that the positive correlation between the parameters ( in the log  log space ) is significant at a level much higher than @xmath45 .",
    "the lower panel in the same figure shows @xmath46 ( i.e. the maximum emitted power ) plotted as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "the two parameters appear to be loosely anti - correlated ( @xmath47 , but @xmath480.20.3 , in both cases ) .",
    "however , when we fit the data ( in log - log space , we find that : @xmath49 .",
    "this result indicates that , if there is a correlation between these two parameters , it is an anti - correlation : as the maximum power emitted increases , the frequency at which it is emitted decreases .",
    "we have studied 20 archival xmm - newton observations of pks @xmath0 which have been performed in a period of over twelve years from 2000 to 2012 .",
    "these observations can be useful in the study of the long - term optical / uv and x - ray variability of the source , not just because their number is large , but also because they allow us to study the flux and spectral variability of the source , over a broad frequency range , _",
    "simultaneously_. our main results can be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) the source is variable at all bands on time scales of years .",
    "the amplitude of the rms variability is of the order of @xmath1% at all bands .",
    "we did not observe any extreme activity taking place during these observations .",
    "the variability amplitude slightly increases from the soft to the hard x - ray band , and decreases from the optical to the uv bands .",
    "\\(2 ) the optical / uv band fluxes increase and decrease in phase , i.e. the optical / uv band variations are well correlated",
    ". however , the x - ray and optical / uv fluxes are not correlated .",
    "we then used ( i ) a log - parabolic ( lp ) model and ( ii ) a power - law plus log - parabolic ( pllp ) model to fit the broad band seds .",
    "the lp model fits are not formally acceptable .",
    "massaro et al .  ( 2004 ) and tramacere et al .  (",
    "2009 ) have found that a lp model can well fit the optical / uv and x - ray spectra individually , but could not fit the combined optical / uv and x - ray bands .",
    "our results are in agreement with their results .",
    "the fits improve in the case of the pllp model , but there are still significant discrepancies above @xmath50 kev in the x - rays , most probably due to the increased contribution of the ic component at larger energies .",
    "we repeated the fits using data up to @xmath24 hz only .",
    "these model fits appear to describe rather well the overall shape of the optical / uv / x - ray spectrum of the source at the @xmath21% level , i.e. the data / model ratio is typically between 0.95 and 1.05 at all energies up to @xmath24 hz ) .",
    "if we increase the error of the data points to this level , then the pllp model fits the data well .",
    "if we accept that a pllp model can parametrize the optical / uv and x - ray sed of the source then our results from the sed fitting of all observations can be summarized as follows :    \\(3 ) the turn - over frequency correlates _ positively _ with the model spectral slope , and with the curvature parameter , @xmath2 : as the turn - over energy increases , the spectrum steepens , and the curvature parameter increases .",
    "\\(4 ) due to the above mentioned correlations , the peak frequency , @xmath43 and the curvature parameter @xmath2 are also positively correlated .",
    "as @xmath43 shifts to higher energies , the spectral curvature also increases following the relation : @xmath51 .",
    "\\(5 ) we do not observe a strong correlation between the peak power , @xmath46 , and the peak frequency , @xmath43 . if there is a relation between these two parameters , it is most probably an anti - correlation , in the sense that as the peak luminosity decreases , the peak frequency shifts to to higher energies , roughly according to the relation : @xmath52 .",
    "massaro et al .  ( 2008 ) considered a sample of blazars and observed an anti - correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath2 for five tev blazars including pks @xmath54 , 1h @xmath55 , mrk 501 , and 1es @xmath56 .",
    "they also found a positive correlation between the spectrum peak power , @xmath57 , and @xmath53 .",
    "these correlations and anti - correlations were based on the results when a log - parabolic model was used to fit the x - ray spectra only .",
    "clearly , our results regarding the relations between @xmath58 and @xmath57 are contrary to those reported by massaro et al .",
    "however , they also studied pks 2155 - 204 , and found that the @xmath59 and @xmath60 relations in this object were different than the same relations for the other objects in their sample results .",
    "in fact , the observational relations presented in their fig",
    ".  8 are quite similar to our plots shown in fig .",
    "6 .    from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", the pllp model can be explained if the the electron distribution at low energies follows a power - law up to a turn - over energy , and a log - parabolic shape at higher energies .",
    "if that is the case , our results indicate that this low - energy power - law branch is always present in pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "furthermore , we can constrain the typical slope of the power - law energy distribution of the electrons , @xmath61 , using the the well - known relation between @xmath61 and @xmath42 : @xmath62 . for the mean spectral index value of @xmath63 in our case",
    ", we estimate that @xmath64 .",
    "this slope is fully consistent with predictions of models which assume first - order fermi acceleration as being the primary acceleration mechanism in most collisionless magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks , as has been shown both analytically ( e.g.  bell 1978 , kirk et al .",
    "2000 ) and numerically ( e.g.  bednarz & ostrowski 1998 ; baring et al . 1999 ; ellison & double 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of the log - parabolic branch in the electron distribution can be explained as in massaro et al .",
    "these authors have shown that when the acceleration efficiency of particles is inversely proportional to the energy itself , then the energy distribution approaches a log - parabolic shape .",
    "they proposed that the log - parabolic spectra are naturally produced when the statistical acceleration probability have an energy dependency . according to this model the curvature , @xmath25 ,",
    "is related to the fractional acceleration gain @xmath65 by @xmath66^{-1}$ ] and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the peak energy .",
    "this produces a negative trend in the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath2 ( see tramacere et al .",
    "2009 ) .    an alternative explanation of the above trend is provided by the stochastic acceleration framework that includes a momentum diffusion term .",
    "the diffusion term plays a crucial role in the broadening of the spectral shape of the electrons ( kardashev et al .",
    "1962 ; massaro et al .  2006 ) .",
    "tramacere et al .  (",
    "2009 ) showed that the log - parabolic spectrum results from the evolution of a mono - energetic or quasi - mono - energetic particles injection under a fokker - planck equation with a momentum - diffusion term .",
    "kardashev et al .  (",
    "1962 ) have shown that the curvature term @xmath25 is inversely proportional to the diffusion term @xmath69 and the time @xmath70 : @xmath71 .",
    "this relation leads to the following connection between the peak frequency , the peak energy of the electron distribution , @xmath72 , and the spectral curvature @xmath2 ( eqn .  5 of tramacere et al .",
    "2009 ) : @xmath73 .",
    "hence both the fractional acceleration gain term , @xmath65 , and the momentum diffusion term , @xmath69 predict an anti - correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , this opposite to what we observe . as we showed in section 4 ,",
    "if there is a relation between @xmath68 and @xmath2 , this is a _ positive _ , and not a negative one .",
    "the inability of the model to provide acceptable fits to the broad band optical / uv / x - ray seds of pks @xmath0 , as well as the positive correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath2 that we observe , perhaps indicates that the optical / uv and x - ray emission in this source are produced by two different populations of leptons .",
    "optical / uv emission may be produced by slow leptons and the x - ray emission may due to emission from much more energetic leptons , which may have been accelerated through the energy dependent particle acceleration mechanism .",
    "this possibility could also explain the fact that the optical / uv bands are well correlated with each other but not correlated with x - ray bands .",
    "another possibility for the positive correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath2 can arise within the stochastic acceleration framework if the cooling losses successfully compete with the acceleration and diffusion components ( tramacere et al .",
    "however , only if we can analyze more seds , preferably including a wider range of em bands , might the correlations between these parameters be clarified .",
    "that would definitely increase our understanding of the emission processes that dominate the spectra of blazars .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for insightful suggestions .",
