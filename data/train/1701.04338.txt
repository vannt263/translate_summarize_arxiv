    "the observation of gravitational waves ( gws ) by advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( aligo )  @xcite has initiated a new era of exploring the cosmology , the nature of gravity as well as the fundamental particle physics by the gws detectors  @xcite . especially , due the the limitation of the colliders energy , gws detectors can be used as new techniques to probe the symmetry breaking patterns or phase transition history for a large class of new physics models with hidden gauge group extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , which are motivated by the experimental results in our understanding of particle cosmology and fundamental physics ( such as the dark matter mystery or the puzzling observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ) , and no evidence for new physics discovered at current collider experiments .",
    "the increasingly attractive new physics models with hidden non - abelian gauge group extensions of the sm have many new particles without leaving any observable imprints at current particle colliders .",
    "however , the gws experiments may provide a possible approach to test their existence .",
    "for example , to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweak baryogenesis by the hidden sectors , a strong first - order phase transition is usually needed to realize the departure from thermal equilibrium  @xcite . and",
    "during the first - order phase transition , the gws will be produced through three mechanisms : collisions of expanding bubbles , sounds waves , and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence of bubbles in the hot plasma  @xcite .",
    "phase transitions in particle physics and cosmology are usually associated with the symmetry breaking , i.e. where the universe transits from a symmetric phase to a symmetry broken phase when the temperature drops below the corresponding critical temperature .",
    "for the first time , we have a chance to explore the hidden gauge symmetry breaking through phase transition gws signals after the discovery of the gws by aligo , which is is particularly exciting . in this paper , we study the possibility to to explore the hidden gauge symmetry breaking patterns by the phase transition gws signals .",
    "in particular , we will focalize our analysis to gws detection of the non - abelian gauge group extended models , where the symmetry breaking at each energy scale may associate with a first - order phase transition , as shown in fig.[sb ] . the hidden group @xmath0 , which can spontaneously breaks into the sm gauge group @xmath1 . during the hidden gauge symmetry breaking ,",
    "a strong first - order phase transition can take place , which will produce detectable phase transition gws .",
    "for example , the hidden gauge group @xmath0 can be the non - abelian group @xmath2 , and the model is called 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite .",
    "we show that many versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model can produce at least one time strong first - order phase transitions at the energy of several tev in some parameter spaces , which can produce detectable gws spectrum at evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa )  @xcite , big bang observer ( bbo )  @xcite",
    ". in general , there can exist many times spontaneous symmetry breaking , which may also accompany several times first - order phase transition as shown in fig.[sb ] .",
    "if the energy scale of the symmetry breaking and first - order phase transition is at @xmath3 gev triggered in the hidden sector , the phase transition gws spectrum is within the sensitivity of future aligo .",
    "other attractive examples of gws detection of the non - abelian gauge group extended models are also discussed , such as the first - order dark qcd phase transition gws in the relaxion mechanism  @xcite , which may be tested by pulsa time array ( pta ) at the square kilometre array ( ska )  @xcite or the five - hundred - meter aperture spherical telescope ( fast )  @xcite in china . the other one is the nnaturalness mechanism  @xcite , which may also produce observable phase transition gws signals at the gws detector .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we schematically discuss the gws detection of the hidden gauge group symmetry breaking and show how to calculate the phase transitino gws during the first - order phase transition . in section iii , we will study the phase transition gws spectra in some concrete hidden gauge group extended models . in section iv , we show our final discussions and conclusions .",
    "in a large class of new physics models with extended hidden non - abelian gauge group , one or several times cosmological phase transitions can occur during each step s hidden gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "in general , we can have the gauge symmetry breaking patterns with the extended hidden gauge group at each scales with the evolution of our history as shown in fig .",
    "for example , the hidden symmetry breaking pattern may be the following : @xmath4 with the evolution of our universe , symmetry breaking will happen at corresponding energy scale , where the strong first - order phase transition may take place .",
    "detailed models are given in section iii .",
    "along with the symmetry breaking from a ` false ' vacuum to a ` true ' vacuum , strong first - order phase transition occurs if there exists a sufficient potential barrier between them .",
    "this process can produce an observable stochastic gws signals , which can be detected in some gws detectors , such as aligo , elisa  @xcite , bbo  @xcite , ska , fast and so on .",
    "their sensitivity range for some critical temperatures depends on the energy scale of the first - order phase transition for different dark hidden group extended models , as we show in section iii .    to discuss the gws spectrum from the first - order phase transition",
    ", it is needed to begin with the one - loop finite temperature effective potential : @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the order parameter of the phase transition ( a real scalar field ) , @xmath7 is the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential at @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the thermal contribution including the daisy resummation  @xcite .    during each step of symmetry breaking in the hidden gauge group extended models ,",
    "strong first - order phase transition may occur . during the first - order phase transition",
    ", bubbles are nucleated via quantum tunneling or thermally fluctuating the potential barrier .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12  @xcite , where @xmath13 is the euclidean action  @xcite defined as @xmath14 .",

    "the first - order phase transition terminates when nucleation probability of one bubble per horizon volume is of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "that is to say , it should satisfy @xmath22    it is known that there exist three major sources for producing gws during the first - order phase transition , which are collisions of the vacuum bubbles  @xcite , sound waves  @xcite and turbulence  @xcite in the plasma after collisions , respectively .",
    "the most well - known source is the bubbles collisions , and the first - order phase transition gws spectrum depends on four parameters .",
    "the first one is the ratio @xmath23 of the vacuum energy density released in the phase transition to that of the thermal bath , defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 specifies that the quantity is evaluated at the time @xmath26 determined by eq.([tn ] ) .",
    "note that , the false vacuum energy density @xmath27|_{t = t_{\\ast}}$ ] is the latent heat density , and the plasma thermal energy density @xmath28 is equal to @xmath29 . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the temperature - dependent true minimum of the effective potential of the scalar field , which is responsible for the phase transition .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 measures the strength of the phase transition gws , namely , a larger value for @xmath23 corresponds to a stronger first - order phase transition gws .",
    "the second one is the time duration of the phase transition @xmath31 , where one has @xmath32 . in other words",
    ", @xmath31 corresponds to the typical time scale of the phase transition .",
    "since @xmath33 during the phase transition from its definition , one has @xmath34    the third one is the efficiency factor @xmath35 , which characterizes the fraction of the energy density converted into the motion of the colliding bubble walls and the last one is the bubble wall velocity @xmath36 .",
    "the energy released into the gws of peak frequency is then given by @xcite : @xmath37    the second and third sources are the gws from the matter fluid effects , which can further contribute to the total energy released in gravitational radiation during the phase transition . here , we just use the formulae given in @xcite .",
    "one source is from the sound waves in the fluid , where a certain fraction @xmath38 of the bubble wall energy ( after the collision ) is converted into motion of the fluid ( and is only later dissipated ) with the following contribution @xmath39 the other one is from turbulence in the fluid , where a certain fraction @xmath40 of the walls energy is converted into turbulence , with the contribution @xmath41 it is worth noticing that these two contributions from the matter fluid effects depend on @xmath42 linearly , and they are not fully understood . in some cases , these two effects may be larger than the one from bubble collisions .",
    "the peak frequency produced by bubble wall collisions at @xmath26 during the first - order order phase transition is given by  @xcite : @xmath43 .",
    "considering the adiabatic expansion of our universe from the early universe to the present universe , the ratio of scale factors at the time of first - order phase transition and today can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the effective degrees of freedom at @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the peak frequency today is @xmath46 , and the corresponding gw intensity is given by  @xcite @xmath47 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the peak frequency of the gws signals due to the sound wave effects is about @xmath48 @xcite , and similarly its current value is @xmath49 . in this case , the gws intensity is expressed as @xcite @xmath50^{7/2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath51 for relativistic bubbles  @xcite .",
    "the gws signals produced from the turbulence in the plasma have the peak frequency at about @xmath52 @xcite , which determines the current value as @xmath53 after considering the red shift .",
    "the phase transition gws intensity from turbulence is formulated by @xcite @xmath54 the final phase transition spectrum consists of the three contributions above .",
    "in this section , we discuss the phase transition gws in some non - abelian gauge group extended models in details , where one or several times symmetry breaking and first - order phase transition may occur with the evolution of our universe at certain critical temperature .",
    "firstly , the gws spectra in the hidden gauge group extended models based on the @xmath2 gauge symmetry , commonly known as the 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite are investigated .",
    "the 3 - 3 - 1 models can explain the electric charge quantization and three generation  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . here",
    ", we try to explore the possible phase transition patterns associated with the symmetry breaking @xmath55 using the phase transition gws in some versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 models , where the scalars fields are accommodated in a certain representation of the @xmath56 gauge group in each version .    in the following",

    "the bosonic fields contribute to the thermal effective potential of the form @xmath57 in the limit of high - temperature expansion . to begin with the concrete prediction of the gws in the following examples , we first discuss the general effective potential near the symmetry breaking and phase transition temperature , which can be approximated by @xmath58 here , x represents the field of the order parameter for the phase transition . for the electroweak phase transition in the sm ,",
    "x field is just the higgs field .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 quantify the interactions between @xmath60 field and the light bosons , and can be schematically written as @xmath61 . and , the parameters @xmath62 depends on interaction between @xmath60 and light bosons and fermions .",
    "for the heavy fields whose mass is much larger than the critical temperature , their contribution can be omitted .",
    "this can helps to simplify our discussions when the models have many new fields at different energy scales .",
    "thus , in this case of qualitative analysis , the wash out parameter can be obtained as @xmath63 where the angle bracket means the vev of the field @xmath60 at the critical temperature @xmath64 . from the above qualitative analysis , we know that introducing new light bosonic fields ( compared to the corresponding critical temperature ) helps to produce or enhance the first - order phase transition .",

    "<S> motivated by the discovery of gravitational waves ( gws ) and no evidence of new physics at current lhc , we discuss that many extended new physics models with hidden gauge group could undergo one or several times first - order phase transitions associated with the gauge group symmetry breaking in the evolution history of universe , which might produce detectable phase transition gws signals at future gws experiments , such as elisa . </S>"
