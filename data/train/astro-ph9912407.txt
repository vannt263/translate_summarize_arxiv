    "the level of beaming in grbs is one of the most interesting open questions in this subject .",
    "the relativistic flow which drives a grb may range from isotropic to strongly collimated into a narrow opening angle .",
    "the degree of collimation ( beaming ) of the outflow has many implications on most aspects grb research , such as the requirements from the `` inner engine '' , the energy release and the event rate . during the prompt emission",
    "the lorentz factor of the flow is very high ( @xmath0 ) , and due to relativistic aberration of light , only a narrow angle of @xmath1 around the line of sight ( los ) is visible . during the afterglow stage , the flow decelerates and an increasingly larger angle becomes visible .",
    "as long as @xmath2 an outflow collimated within an angle @xmath3 around the los produces the same observed radiation as if it were part of a spherical outflow .",
    "once @xmath4 drops below @xmath5 , the observer can notice that radiation arrives only from within an angle @xmath3 around the los , instead of @xmath6 as in the spherical case .",
    "sideways expansion is also expected to become important when @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these two effects combine to create a break in the light curve at @xmath7 , but it is not quite clear whether this break is sharp enough to be detected @xcite . to explore this question we have performed fully relativistic three dimensional simulations that follow the slowing down and the lateral expansion of a relativistic jet .",
    "we then calculate the synchrotron light curve and spectrum using the conditions determined by the hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "we use a fully relativistic three dimensional code for the hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "the initial conditions are a wedge with an opening angle @xmath8 taken from the blandford mckee @xcite , bm hereafter , self similar spherical solution , embedded in a cold and homogeneous ambient medium . for this initial opening angle",
    ", the jet is expected to show considerable lateral expansion when @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is the lorentz factor of the fluid .",
    "the bm solution used for the initial conditions was therefore at the time when @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lorentz factor of the shock .",
    "the total isotropic energy was @xmath12 , and the ambient number density was @xmath13 .    in figures [ fig2]-[fig5 ] we present snapshots of the number density , internal energy density , lorentz factor and velocity field of the fluid , as the jet slows down and spreads sideways .",
    "an explanation of what is seen in these snapshots is given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the snapshots are taken at consecutive times , ranging @xmath14 in the rest frame of the ambient medium ( corresponding roughly to observer times from one and a half to twenty days for an observer along the jet axis ) .",
    "the results shown in this work are still preliminary .",
    "the resolution is not sufficient to resolve the very thin initial shell .",
    "for this reason the maximal lorentz factor of the matter is just over @xmath15 , instead of @xmath16 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "higher resolution runs are in progress .",
    "the local emission coefficient at a given space - time point is calculated directly from the hydrodynamical quantities there .",
    "the magnetic field and electron energy densities are assumed to hold constant fractions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , of the internal energy , while the electrons posses a power law energy distribution , @xmath19 .",
    "the local emissivity is approximated by a broken power law : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , below and above the typical synchrotron frequency , respectively @xcite .",
    "the light curves and spectra are calculated for several viewing angles with respect to the jet axis .",
    "once the emission coefficient is determined in the local frame , it is transformed to the frame of each observer .",
    "the time of arrival to each observer is then calculated , and the contributions are sumed over space - time , producing the various light curves .",
    "this is done for several frequencies , simultaneously , so that the spectrum may be obtained , as well as the light curve at different frequencies .",
    "a few light curves , calculated for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are shown in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "these light curves serve to demonstrate the potential of this approach .",
    "future simulations are expected to achieve sufficient resolution to produce realistic light curves which could be compared with afterglow observations .",
