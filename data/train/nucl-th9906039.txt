    "a microscopic theory of nuclear structure would be very incomplete without a satisfactory description of nuclear rotational states in terms of many - nucleon quantum mechanics . however ,",
    "while the states of a truly rigid rotor can be handled with ease @xcite , they do not have square - integrable wave functions in either a spherical vibrational - model or many - nucleon hilbert space . moreover",
    ", the expansion of liquid - like , soft - rotor , wave functions on any spherical basis is slowly convergent .",
    "this means that many major shells are required for a realistic shell - model theory of nuclear rotational states .",
    "it also means that a realistic calculation of nuclear rotational states in terms of interacting nucleons , without a priori knowledge of the kinds of correlations to expect , is an impossibly difficult task .",
    "the fact remains that nuclear rotational bands are exceedingly simple ; they are essentially characterized by a few intrinsic quadrupole moments and moments of inertia .",
    "furthermore , they are observed in a wide range of nuclei throughout the periodic table .",
    "thus , it would appear that the phenomenon is remarkably robust and relies very little , for its existence , on the details of the two - nucleon interaction .",
    "as demonstrated by calculations within the framework of the nuclear symplectic model @xcite , it is possible to construct model rotational states with many - nucleon wave functions . the problem is to understand why the model works as well as it does ; i.e , why the many residual interactions that strongly break symplectic symmetry , by mixing states of different irreps , do not destroy the predictions of the model .    to understand this , the effects of the dominant symmetry breaking interactions have been explored one at a time .",
    "it has been shown that , while a spin - orbit interaction may mix su(3 ) irreps strongly , it does so , in large - dimensional irreps , in a highly coherent way such that the rotational spectrum of the model survives @xcite .",
    "similar coherent mixings of su(3 ) irreps by pairing forces were found while investigating the transition of a many - fermion model @xcite from a superconducting phase to a rotational phase with variation of the relative strengths of short - range ( pairing ) and long - range ( quadrupole - quadrupole ) interactions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine in some detail the very strong mixing of major harmonic - oscillator shells and su(3 ) irreps , within the framework of the symplectic model . again",
    "the mixings are extraordinarily coherent .",
    "we refer to this coherent mixing as a _ quasi - dynamical symmetry _ @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that , because the residual interactions separately preserve quasi - dynamical symmetry , they continue to do so when combined for suitable ranges of their strengths .",
    "this conjecture is strongly supported by the observation of rotational states in nuclei which demonstrates unequivocally that they do survive .",
    "the discovery of quasi - dynmical symmetry gives optimism that realistic calculations of rotational states , which simultaneously take into account the mixings between major shells and , for example , the effects of spin - orbit and short - range ( e.g. , pairing ) interactions , may be possible . up to the present time such calculation have not been possible except within the framework of a highly constrained ( e.g. , hartree - bogolyubov ) approximation .",
    "the calculations reported here are carried out with a simple davidson interaction potential @xcite .",
    "this interaction preserves a higher , symplectic model , symmetry which makes calculations in a very large multi - shell space possible . with this interaction , the hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule",
    "was recently diagonalized by a simple non - linear transformation from a spherical vibrator basis to a soft rotor basis using an @xmath1 spectrum generating algebra ( isomorphic to @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "a similar transformation @xcite gives rotational states in the bohr - mottelson collective model @xcite .",
    "for a many - nucleon nucleus , one can construct a hamiltonian comprising the many - nucleon kinetic energy , a spherical shell model potential , and the same davidson potential as used to obtain rotational states in the pheomenological bohr - mottelson model .",
    "the davidson potential is a scalar function of the nuclear quadrupole moments expressed in terms of nucleon coordinates .",
    "thus , it is microscopic and rotationally - invariant .",
    "more importantly , it is expressible in terms of an @xmath3 spectrum generating algebra and and gives a hamiltonian that is diagonalizable within a single irrep of the symplectic model @xcite .",
    "we are not able to give analytical expressions for its wave functions , as we were @xcite for the diatomic molecule and bohr - mottelson model .",
    "but , we are able to compute its states numerically and expand them on a spherical shell - model basis .",
    "this is done by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a basis that reduces the dynamical subalgebra chain ( 3,r ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) , where @xmath4 is the symmetry algebra of the spherical harmonic oscillator shell model @xcite .",
    "symplectic model calculations in an @xmath5 basis have been developed to a fine art using vcs ( vector coherent state ) methods @xcite to calculate matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , they can be carried out in large spaces with relative ease .",
    "an important property of the @xmath6 algebra is that it contains , as a subalgebra , a spectrum generating algebra for a rigid - rotor model , namely ui s @xmath7{\\mbox{\\lfrak so}}(3)$ ] algebra @xcite .",
    "however , one can not diagonalize a symplectic model hamiltonian in a basis that reduces the subalgebra chain ( 3,r ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) , because , as mentioned above , rigid - rotor wave functions are not expandable in a shell - model basis ( in technical terms , the decomposition is not a direct sum ; it is a direct integral . ) .",
    "one notes , however , that the hamiltonian we are considering as a model of a soft rotor has two components : a spherical shell model part which reduces the @xmath8 chain and a davidson potential which reduces @xmath9{\\mbox{\\lfrak so}}(3 ) \\supset { \\mbox{\\lfrak so}}(3)$ ] .",
    "thus , we expect results that lie between the two limits .",
    "in fact , the results of our calculations prove to be such that both @xmath7{\\mbox{\\lfrak so}}(3)$ ] and @xmath4 are extremely good quasi - dynamical symmetries .",
    "this is a remarkable result , because although @xmath4 and the rigid - rotor algebra have similar algebraic structures , they have very different physical interpretations .    a lie algebra @xmath10 is said to be a quasi - dynamical symmetry for a hamiltonian @xmath11 if the matrix elements of @xmath10 between a set of eigenstates of @xmath11 are equal to those of an irrep of @xmath10 , even though the eigenstates in question do not belong to a subspace of the hilbert space for @xmath11 that is irreducible under the action of @xmath10 . at first sight",
    "this would be appear to be an unlikely physical situation .",
    "indeed , if matrix elements of an algebra @xmath10 were found in some situation to be equal to those of an irrep , one might be tempted to infer that @xmath10 is a full dynamical symmetry for the hamiltonian .",
    "the soft rotor model is the prototype of a situation where this is not the case , as we now show .",
    "let @xmath12 denote a basis of wave functions for a rigid rotor with intrinsic quadrupole moments |q_0 = k , |q_1=|q_-1=0 , |q_2 = |q_-2 = 1k , where @xmath13 is a suitable constant , cf .",
    "( [ eq : betagamma ] ) . then soft - rotor wave functions can be expressed _",
    "klm = f _ ( , ) _ klm ( , ) dv , where d@xmath14 is a suitable volume element for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "one finds that the matrix elements between all states of the same @xmath17 are equal to those of a rigid rotor of deformation |q_0= k f _ ( , ) dv , |q_2=k f _ ( , ) dv .",
    "thus , the states of a given @xmath17 span an _ embedded representation _ of the rigid - rotor algebra in the terminology of ref.@xcite and we say that the rigid - rotor algebra is a quasi - dynamical symmetry for the soft rotor .",
    "an examination of the physics of the situation quickly reveals that the rigid - rotor algebra is a quasi - dynamical symmetry whenever the rotations are adiabatic relative to the complementary vibrational motions .",
    "thus , one obtains the rigid - rotor algebra as a quasi - dynamical symmetry for a rotor - vibrator hamiltonian whenever the rotational - vibrational ( i.e. , coriolis and centrifugal ) coupling interactions are negligible or omitted . they can be taken into account subsequently , as quasi - dynamical symmetry - breaking perturbations , as is standard in the pheomenological rotor model .",
    "now it is known @xcite that the @xmath4 algebra contracts to the rigid - rotor algebra @xmath7{\\mbox{\\lfrak so}}(3)$ ] and that this contraction is realized for large - dimensional irreps of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we say that @xmath4 is a quasi - dynamical symmetry for a sequence of states if their expansions on an @xmath4 basis are of the form _",
    "klm = _ c _ ^_klm , where @xmath18 is a basis of states of a large - dimensional @xmath4 irrep of highest weight @xmath19 .",
    "note that shell - model states can always be expanded on an @xmath4 basis .",
    "however , we only obtain @xmath4 as a quasi - dynamical symmetry if the coefficients @xmath20 are independent of @xmath21 for a useful range of values of the latter .    the fact that @xmath4 is",
    "a good quasi - dynamical symmetry for major - shell mixing hamiltonians is extremely important for achieving the eventual goal of including @xmath3 symmetry - breaking interactions in the symplectic model . for although ,",
    "interactions like the spin - orbit and pairing interactions break @xmath6 , they have been shown to preserve quasi - dynamical @xmath4 symmetry @xcite .",
    "this is expected to occur , to a good approximation , whenever the rotational motions one is describing are known from experiment to be adiabatic .",
    "the concept of quasi - dynamical symmetry can be regarded simply as a group - theoretical expression of the standard methods for handling adiabatic decoupling of collective motions along the lines of the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite and the standard nuclear rotor model .",
    "a formulation in the precise language of group theory has the advantage that it opens the concept up to more general application .",

    "this we believe to be a reflection of the fact that , although the davidson potential has many useful features , it rises too steeply away from the equilibrium deformation .",
    "the second notable result is that the symplectic model gives three monopole - quadrupole giant resonance bands ; two of these , the @xmath171 and @xmath172 bands , occur also ( albeit at much lower energy ) in the bohr - mottelson model where they are associated with beta- and gamma - vibrations , respectively .",

    "the monopole and quadrupole giant resonance states in real nuclei are believed to lie at energies close to @xmath170 . however , their strength is invariably fragmented and much of it lies in the continuum .",
    "thus , we make no attempt to compare our results for the gr states with experiment .",
    "however , it is of interest to examine the structure of the wave functions .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] shows the decomposition of the @xmath171 ( giant - beta band ) states in terms of their su(3 ) components , for the self - consistent value of @xmath42 , in comparison with the corresponding decomposition of the ground - band states .",
    "it can be seen that the amplitude coefficients ( including their signs ) are independent of angular momentum to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "it can also be seen that the coefficients for the two sets of states have the same signs except for those of the stretched states , which are of opposite sign .",
    "note that the relative signs of the amplitude coefficients for different su(3 ) subirreps are determined by su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coeffients @xcite and have no particular meaning , in general , except for the stretched states which all have the same sign .",
    "however , a change in the relative signs of coefficients between the ground and excited states is meaningful .",
    "thus , it is fortuitous that the coefficients for the stretched states all have positive sign for the states of the ground state band because it highlights the fact that these coefficients change sign for the giant beta band . on reflection",
    "this is what one would expect for a giant - beta vibrational excitation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : evabs ] ) .",
    "the symplectic model is currently the only model that is capable of giving rotational states for heavy nuclei as eigenstates of a rotationally - invariant hamiltonian in a realistic shell - model space .",
    "thus , the ability of the model to give the energy levels and @xmath0 transitions strengths between states for ground - state rotational bands , without the use of an effective charge , provides a powerful framework for understanding the dynamics of nuclear rotations in terms of interacting neutrons and protons .",
    "early applications of the model by park _",
    "_ @xcite were remarkably successful and raised many interesting questions .",
    "however , because of the severe truncations of the space that were necessary at the time , the reliability of the results could be questioned . in particular ,",
    "one was concerned that the ability of the model to give correct moments of inertia might be lost on increasing the size of the model space .",
    "the results of the present calculations show that this is not the case .",
    "a particularly interesting challenge was to learn how a model , without pair correlations , could give correct moments of inertia when it is known that the cranking model is only succesful when pairing correlations are included .",
    "the early calculations of park _ et al .",
    "_ indicated that the dominant contribution to rotational energies came from the potential energy part of the hamiltonian , thus calling into question the very concept of the moment of inertia as an inverse coefficient of the @xmath174 term in the kinetic energy .",
    "the results of the present calculation indicate that the inclusion of only stretched states , as in the calculation of park _ et al .",
    "_ , tends to exagerate this effect .",
    "nevertheless , it confirms that the dominant component of the rotational energies comes from the potential energy ; for the self - consistent value of @xmath42 only about 20% of the rotational energy comes from the kinetic energy in the present calculation .",
    "in addition to investigating rotational states up to much higher angular momentum @xmath175 , the present calculations have focussed on understanding the structure of rotational states in terms of their su(3 ) content .",
    "we have shown that although there is huge mixing of su(3 ) irreps from many major harmonic oscillator shells , the mixing is highly coherent and establishes su(3 ) as a remarkably good quasi - dynamical symmetry for the model .",
    "other calculations @xcite , reviewed in @xcite , show that such quasi - dynamical symmetry is also conserved when su(3 ) irreps are further mixed by spin - orbit and pairing forces .",
    "thus , the results show that , as far as the calculation of @xmath0 transition rates are concerned , the use of a single su(3 ) irrep with an effective charge will give accurate results .",
    "however , for other observables , not related to elements in the su(3 ) algebra , there is no reason whatever to expect effective charge methods to take account of the large mixing of su(3 ) irreps observed .",
    "the close agreement between the results of the symplectic model calculation and those of the rigid - rotor model , shows that , by definition , the rigid - rotor algebra is also an excellent quasi - dynamical symmetry for the symplectic model with a davidson potential . but again , for observables not related to the rigid - rotor algebra , such as electron scattering current operators , one can not predict what the results will be by purely algebraic methods .",
    "the fact that two competing dynamical subgroup chains , although very different in their physical content , can both be good quasi - dynamical symmetries is remarkable but understandable .",
    "it can happen because , for large - dimensional representations and states of relatively low angular momentum , an su(3 ) irrep contracts to an irrep of the rigid - rotor algebra @xcite .",
    "thus , it transpires that the lower angular - momentum states of a large - dimensional su(3 ) irrep belong to an embedded representation @xcite of the rigid - rotor algebra and vice - versa .",
    "having demonstrated that symplectic model calculations with phenomenological ( albeit microscopically expressable ) potentials have the ability to describe nuclear rotational states , our next goal would be ideally to perform calculations within the same ( large ) shell model space but with realistic two - nucleon interactions .",
    "such calculations can and have been contemplated for light nuclei @xcite . but they are computer intensive and impractical for heavy rotational nuclei .",
    "we would even like to go further and include spin - orbit and short - range ( e.g. , pairing ) interactions which mix different @xmath176 irreps .",
    "we would like to carry out calculations for superdeformed bands @xcite as well as for normally deformed low - lying rotational bands of heavy nuclei .",
    "superdeformed bands are naturally associated with excited representations of the symplectic model which fall into the low - energy domain ( as do nilsson model states ) as a consequence of shell effects in a deformed shell model .",
    "the challenge is to explain why they do not mix more readily with the large density of less deformed low - energy states .",
    "we believe that symplectic symmetry and su(3 ) quasi - dynamical symmetry has the potential to answer such questions .",
    "it is unlikely that such calculations will ever be done in a shell - model space sufficiently large to ensure convergence of the results .",
    "however , the results of the present study and previous investigations of mixing su(3 ) irreps with spin - orbit @xcite and pairing interactions@xcite imply that , when experiment finds states of a nucleus that are fitted well by the rotor model and to have a large deformation , then we have reason to believe that su(3 ) is a good quasi - dynamical symmetry for these states .",
    "armed with this information , one can hope to design realistic mixed su(3 ) calculations within large spaces .",
    "in particular , one can calculate just one representative angular momentum state for each band , with the understanding that the coefficients should be the same ( to a good approximation ) for all other states of the band .",
    "alternatively , one could carry out calculations in an intrinsic space which includes just the highest weight states for the contributing su(3 ) irreps .",
