    "delay sensitive applications such as audio / video conferencing and real - time control require low end - to - end delay @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "when the ultimate delay of a data packet exceeds a certain threshold , the packet is useless and has to be dropped .",
    "so , the delay violation probability is a suitable quality of service ( qos ) performance metric here @xcite .",
    "in wireless telecommunication systems and a proper channel condition , transmission with high data rate can be accomplished .",
    "in contrast , in a severe condition , the data rate decreases and probably becomes zero .",
    "accordingly , data must tolerate longer stop at the transmitter buffer before transmission .",
    "therefore , in the wireless channel , deterministic guarantee of total transmission delay for each data packet is not possible .",
    "however , with a genuine design , statistical delay constraint can be meet .",
    "in this respect , the interesting theory of effective capacity has been presented recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in contrast to shannon capacity without any restrictions on complexity and delay , effective capacity is defined as the maximum constant arrival rate that a wireless channel can support in order to guarantee quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements such as the statistical delay constraint @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the theory of effective capacity in a general time correlated rayleigh fading channel is introduced in @xcite and in the low signal to noise ratio ( snr ) regime , a closed - form solution for the effective capacity is extracted .",
    "this concept with the statistical qos constraint is completely discussed with a different viewpoint in @xcite for a generic traffic source over a time correlated rayleigh fading channels .",
    "the authors assume a gaussian distribution for the accumulated service rate of the channel , which leads to a solution for the effective capacity of the channels . following these basic researches ,",
    "the effective capacity has been conducted in various communication links such as rate and power adoption in single - input single - output ( siso ) and multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems @xcite-@xcite , antenna selection ( as ) mimo systems @xcite-@xcite and cooperative and cognitive radio channels in @xcite-@xcite .    a mimo wireless communication system is defined as a transmission link where the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple antenna elements to increase channel capacity and data throughput .",
    "digital communication using mimo wireless link , has recently emerged as one of the most significant technical breakthroughs in modern communications such as ieee 802.16 wimax , ieee 802.11 wifi , cellular third and forth generation ( 3g/4 g ) systems @xcite .",
    "hence , for high data rate , multiple antenna structure is assumed here .",
    "study of effective capacity in the mimo channel is a new research topic which is discussed in receive / transmit antenna selection mimo systems in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , the effective capacity of a system in two different cases with single receive antenna selection ( ras ) and single transmit antenna selection ( tas ) schemes in quasi - static fading channel is investigated . when the channel state information ( csi ) is not available at the transmitter , single ras scheme is employed . on the other hand , with the available csi at the transmitter ,",
    "single tas is executed .",
    "moreover , an optimal power - control policy is applied to the selected antenna and the effective capacity of the mimo system is derived . in @xcite , a maximum constant arrival rate with the delay quality - of - service ( qos ) guarantee",
    "is obtained in a mimo orthogonal space time block coding ( mimo - ostbc ) system .",
    "the authors have assumed spatially correlated transmit antenna and simple receiver which employs single ras technique . in both @xcite and @xcite , snr maximization",
    "is considered as a criteria in the antenna selection procedure .    regarding day by day increase of mobile users and request of high frequency reuse in the networks ,",
    "interference mitigation is considered as one of the main challenge in modern communication systems @xcite-@xcite . in this way",
    ", we discuss mimo - ostbc downlink scenario with co - channel interference here .",
    "this point is a reasonable assumption when the mobile station is near the cell edge or even when cognitive radio users are active in the same frequency @xcite-@xcite . in the downlink ,",
    "the transmitter usually have sufficient area , but , the receiver dimension is small .",
    "therefore , ostbc is employed at the transmitter side and single ras technique is applied at the receiver . for this purpose , the receiver examines their antennas in each utilization of the channel , and select the antenna which maximizes the signal to noise plus interference ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "single ras can simplify the receive rf front end @xcite while some performance of multiple antenna is preserved .",
    "finally , the effective capacity of this mimo - ostbc system with single ras scheme is investigated and approved by numerical simulations .",
    "the contribution of this paper can be summarized as :    * closed - form calculation of the effective capacity in the mimo - ostbc downlink channel with the ras scheme , when there are some co - channel interferers working simultaneously * comparing the effective capacity in the mimo - ostbs systems with ras and also miso - ostbc systems which shows the necessity of using ras technique when high qos is required ( see fig .",
    "7 )    this paper is organized as fallows : first , the system model is introduced in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] provides a brief introduction to the effective capacity concept .",
    "the effective capacity of a mimo - ostbc system with the ras scheme is explained in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "finally , the simulation results are presented in section [ sec:5 ] , and section [ sec:6 ] concludes the paper .",
    "the downlink mimo - ostbc system with co - channel interferers is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the mimo system has @xmath0 transmit and @xmath1 receive antennas and there are @xmath2 single antenna interferers which disturb our mimo receiver in the same frequency .",
    "so , in addition to the additive white gaussian noise , we encounter the co - channel interference at the mimo receiver .        in each utilization of the channel ,",
    "@xmath3 symbols are packed , encoded and construct the desired ostbc .",
    "next , this code transmits from @xmath0 antennas at @xmath4 time slots .",
    "therefore , the code rate is considered as @xmath5 .",
    "we assume quasi - static rayleigh flat fading channel in both mimo link and interferer channel .",
    "according to this model , the received symbols by @xmath1 receive antennas at @xmath4 time slots is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the ostbc transmitted symbols and @xmath8 contains transmitted symbols from @xmath2 co - channel interferers during @xmath4 time slots .",
    "similarly , @xmath9 determine the quasi - static flat fading channels between @xmath0 transmit and @xmath1 receive antennas , @xmath10 is the channel coefficients between @xmath2 interferers and mimo receiver and @xmath11 represents additive white gaussian noise components at @xmath1 antennas and @xmath4 time slots . note that , @xmath12 displays @xmath13 complex matrix set .",
    "we assume single ras scheme in the receiver .",
    "therefore , we encounter multiple - input single - output ( miso ) system for more simplicity . regarding ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the received symbols by the selected antenna at @xmath4 time slots is simplified to @xmath14 where @xmath15 depicts miso channel coefficients ans @xmath16 shows interferers channel components.we will show the elements of @xmath17 and @xmath18 by @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .    in the miso - ostbc channels without any distortion , received snr is expressed as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the average snr of the link .",
    "however , when some interferers are available , the transmitted signals by the interferer users are added to the noise and similar to ( [ eq:3 ] ) , we can write signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) as @xmath23 here , @xmath24 represents the received power by the @xmath25-th interferers at the miso receiver , @xmath26 is the white noise power and @xmath27 shows the power of @xmath25-th interferer to noise ratio .",
    "note that , in a dense environment or when we have very close interferers , we can assume @xmath28 , so , the sinr in ( [ eq:4 ] ) is approximated as @xmath29 if all interferers have nearly the same received power , we have @xmath30 and then , @xmath31 has gamma distribution . however , when @xmath32 is not the same for @xmath2 interferers , @xmath33 is very tightly approximated as a gamma distributed random number . this claim is demonstrated for the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath34 interferers in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath32 for different @xmath2 , have displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "now , for more simplicity , we assume @xmath35 in the proceeding .    .",
    "]    since @xmath36 and @xmath37 have gamma distribution ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , then , @xmath40 has beta - prime distribution ( @xmath41 ) @xcite with the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath42 and cdf of @xmath43 where @xmath44 stands for the beta function @xcite .",
    "next , we summarize the sinr as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is replaced by @xmath47 , and @xmath47 denotes the signal to interference ratio as well . to obtain the solution of ( [ eq:7 ] )",
    ", we can use ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . 2.111 - 2 )",
    "and we get @xmath48 where @xmath49",
    "despite the time - varying nature of wireless channels , network service providers must guarantee a specific qos to satisfy their customers who need real - time multimedia communication . in @xcite , wu and negi defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath50 . for a dynamic queuing system with stationary and ergodic arrival and service processes , under sufficient conditions , the queue length process @xmath51 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath52 such that @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 determines a certain threshold , and therefore , we have the following approximation : @xmath55 for a large @xmath54 . for a small @xmath54",
    "the following approximation is shown to be more accurate @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 represents the non - empty buffer probability .",
    "in addition , for the delay experienced by a packet as the main qos metric , we have a similar probability function as @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 indicates the tolerated delay , @xmath60 is a delay - bound , and @xmath61 is jointly determined by both arrival and service processes . the statistical delay constraint in ( [ eq:13 ] )",
    "represents the qos which has to be guaranteed for the delay sensitive traffic sources .",
    "it is apparent that the qos exponent @xmath50 has an important role here .",
    "larger @xmath50 corresponds to more strict qos constraint , while smaller @xmath50 implies looser qos requirements .",
    "effective capacity provides the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by the time - varying wireless channel under the statistical delay constraint ( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the buffer is in a steady - state @xcite , the effective capacity can be viewed as the maximum throughput in the presence of such a constraint .",
    "the effective capacity is defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) in the correlated channels . however in the uncorrelated case it reduces to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the time - varying rate of the channel and @xmath64 denotes the expectation . for a specific application with a given statistical delay requirement , the qos exponent @xmath50 can be determined from ( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "then , the maximum constant arrival rate of the sources that a wireless channel can support in order to guarantee the given qos , is determined from ( [ eq:14 ] ) . @xmath63 and the effective capacity @xmath65",
    "are further discussed in the next section .",
    "the physical layer of downlink mimo - ostbc system is introduced in section [ sec:2 ] where for obtaining simple and cheap handsets , we assumed single ras technique at the receiver .",
    "in addition , single ras can eliminate practical issues such as mutual coupling and spatial correlation between antennas @xcite .",
    "in our assumed case , in each utilization of the channel , one of the @xmath1 receive antenna is selected .",
    "this antenna has maximum sinr among the all @xmath1 antennas as well . here",
    ", @xmath66 denotes the sinr at @xmath1 different receive antennas , and @xmath67 represents these random numbers in an ordered form where @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the channel capacity in this scenario is written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total spectral bandwidth , @xmath71 is the frame duration , and @xmath72 is the maximum value in the set of @xmath73 . by inserting ( [ eq:15 ] ) into ( [ eq:14 ] ) , we obtain the effective capacity as @xmath74 and , @xmath75 .",
