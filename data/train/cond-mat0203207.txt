    "the dynamics and rheology of glassy polymers are known to be very complicated and are still not well understood .",
    "we summarize salient features of such systems below .",
    "first , in the linear response regime , thermal relaxations of the chain conformations occur from microscopic to macroscopic time scales , as revealed in measurements of stress and dielectric responses.@xcite in a relatively early stage , the stress relaxation function @xmath1 , which describes linear response to small shear deformations , can be fitted to the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) form , g_g(t ) = g_0 , [ eq:1.1 ] after a microscopic transient time @xmath11 .",
    "the time @xmath12 is of the order of the structural @xmath2 relaxation time @xmath3 ( to be defined in ( 3.8 ) below ) , which grows dramatically as the temperature @xmath13 is lowered towards the glass transition temperature @xmath14 .",
    "when the time @xmath15 considerably exceeds @xmath16 , the relaxation of the chain conformations is relevant and is well described by the rouse or reptation dynamics , depending on @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively.@xcite here @xmath19 is the polymerization index and @xmath20 is that between entanglements on a chain . for short chain systems with @xmath17 , the overall behavior in the time region @xmath21 may be expressed as g(t ) = g_g(t)+ g_r(t ) .",
    "[ eq:1.2 ] the @xmath22 is the stress time - correlation function in the rouse model whose terminal relaxation time @xmath23 is of order @xmath24 . for entangled chain systems with @xmath18 , the kww function in ( 1.1 )",
    "is followed by the power - law decay , g(t ) e^-1 g_0 ( t/_s ) ^- [ eq:1.3 ] with @xmath25 until the rubbery plateau @xmath26 is reached,@xcite where @xmath27 assumes the modulus @xmath28 of entangled polymers with @xmath29 being the bead number density .",
    "ultimately , @xmath1 follows the reptation relaxation @xmath30 on the time scale of a very long reptation time @xmath31 .",
    "these hierarchical relaxations arise from rearrangements of jammed atomic configurations and subsequent evolution of chain conformations .",
    "they also give rise to the corresponding characteristic behaviors in the frequency - dependent shear modulus @xmath32 , depending on the frequency @xmath33 relative to the inverse characteristic times introduced so far .",
    "@xcite    second , in the nonlinear response regime , glassy fluids generally exhibit highly viscous non - newtonian flow close to ( but above ) @xmath14 even if they are low - molecular - weight fluids.@xcite in such fluids , if @xmath34 , atomic rearrangements are induced not by thermal agitations but by externally applied shear.@xcite in chain systems without entanglements , on one hand , shear thinning occurs at sufficiently high ( but sometimes unrealistically large ) shear rates due to chain elongation.@xcite in entangled polymers , on the other hand , shear thinning occurs at very small shear larger than @xmath35 , where disentanglements are induced by shear.@xcite thus supercooled chain systems are most easily driven into a nonlinear response regime even by extremely small shear , though the crossover shear stress from linear to nonlinear regimes may not be very small .",
    "furthermore , in glassy fluids below @xmath14 , plastic deformations are often induced in the form of large - scale shear bands above a yield stress ( corresponding to a few @xmath36 strain ) .",
    "@xcite it is of great importance to understand how these nonlinear effects occur depending on @xmath5 , @xmath13 , and @xmath19 .",
    "third , in rheological experiments on polymers , use has been made of the stress - optical relation between the deviatoric ( anisotropic ) parts of the dielectric tensor @xmath37 ( at optical frequencies ) and the average stress tensor @xmath38.@xcite in shear flow with mean velocity @xmath39 in the @xmath40 direction , it is expressed as _",
    "xy= c_0 _ xy , _ - _ = c_0 ( _ - _ ) , [ eq:1.4 ] where @xmath41 is called the stress - optical coefficient . for melts this relation excellently holds at relatively high",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath42 ) for general time - dependent nonlinear shear deformations .",
    "if measurements are made in steady states , it holds even close to @xmath14.@xcite for its validity , we need to require that the form contribution to @xmath37 is negligible as compared to the intrinsic contribution@xcite and that the glassy part of the stress is negligible as compared to the usual entropic part .",
    "thus it is violated when the form part is relevant such as in polymer solutions close to the demixing critical point or when measurements are made in transient states close to @xmath14 . in the latter case , as is evident from the enhancement of @xmath16 in ( 1.1 ) , the glassy part of the stress is dominant for relatively rapid deformations.@xcite    while the predictive power of analytic theories in polymer science is still poor , computer simulations@xcite can provide us a useful tool to investigate the microscopic origins of experimentally observed macroscopic phenomena .",
    "in quiescent states , diffusive motions in supercooled melts have been extensively studied using molecular dynamics ( md)@xcite and monte carlo@xcite simulations . in another application ,",
    "nonequilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulations have been useful to investigate chain deformations and rheology in flow.@xcite in particular , krger _",

    "\\(ii ) the nonlinear shear regime sets in at extremely small shear rate of order @xmath8 in supercooled states , where marked shear - thinning and shape changes of chains are found .",
    "scattering and birefringence experiments from weakly sheared melts near @xmath14 seem to be very promising .",
    "\\(iii ) in the nonlinear shear regime , each chain undergoes random tumbling in our melt as in the case of isolated polymer chains in shear flow .",
    "it is of great interest how this effect is universal in solutions and melts and how it influences macroscopic rheological properties .",
    "for example , we are interested in whether or not such tumbling occurs in sheared entangled polymers .",
    "( iv)transient stress divided by @xmath5 after application of shear flow obeys the linear growth @xmath266 for strain less than 0.1 and then saturates into a non - newtonian steady - state viscosity .",
    "this initial growth is much steeper than that predicted by the rouse model . as a result ,",
    "the stress - optical relation does not hold transiently under deformation even in the linear ( zero - shear ) limit .",
    "its violation is more enhanced for larger shear rates .",
    "these are consistent with the experiments .",
    "\\(v ) the time - correlation functions in shear flow are calculated for the end - to - end vector and the modified particle displacement in ( 6.1 ) .",
    "the former represents the relaxation of chain conformations , while the latter the monomeric relaxation on the spatial scale of the particle distance .",
    "we can then determine the shear - dependent relaxation times , @xmath10 and @xmath267 .",
    "they decrease nonlinearly and behave differently as functions of @xmath5 in the nonlinear shear regime as in ( 6.3 ) and ( 6.4 ) .",
    "it is then of great interest how these times behave in strong shear for much larger @xmath19 .",
    "we conjecture that if @xmath19 is sufficiently large , shear should first influence the overall chain conformations , while it does not much affect the monomeric relaxations .",
    "we propose dielectric measurements in shear flow , which should give information of @xmath267.@xcite in addition , as demonstrated in fig.13 , the effect of shear on the van hove self - correlation function is analogous to raising the temperature above @xmath14 as in supercooled binary mixtures.@xcite",

    "<S> after application of shear @xmath5 , transient stress growth @xmath6 first obeys the linear growth @xmath7 for strain less than 0.1 but saturates into a non - newtonian viscosity for larger strain . in steady states , shear - thinning and elongation of chains into ellipsoidal shapes take place for shear @xmath5 larger than @xmath8 . in such strong shear , we find that the chains undergo random tumbling motion taking stretched and compact shapes alternatively . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the validity of the stress - optical relation between the anisotropic parts of the stress tensor and the dielectric tensor , which are violated in transient states due to the presence of a large glassy component of the stress . </S>",
