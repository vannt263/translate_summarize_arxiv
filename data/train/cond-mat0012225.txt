    "the measurement of the temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility , @xmath1 , provides a standard essential diagnostic method for establishing the magnetic properties of a system . a careful comparison between measured data and the predictions for @xmath1 as derived from a model hamiltonian is routinely performed with the goal of establishing numerical values of model parameters , for example , the exchange constant(s ) of the heisenberg model of interacting isolated spins .",
    "the success of this technique is so firmly established that it is taken for granted that there is a one - to - one correspondence between a given form of @xmath1 and the numerical values of the model parameters .",
    "most certainly it is unnatural to contemplate that one might be able to continuously vary the parameters of a model hamiltonian and yet generate a single , invariant form for @xmath1 and similarly for other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "yet surprisingly , there are a number of exceptional systems , where there is a continuous infinity - to - one correspondence between model hamiltonians and measurable thermodynamic quantities .",
    "one of these exceptional cases was recently encountered @xcite,@xcite in the course of attempting to determine the exchange constants of a simulating heisenberg model from experimental susceptibility data for a specific synthetic magnetic compound @xcite .",
    "+ we shall refer to systems of a continuous family having the same eigenvalue spectrum as being ",
    "isospectral \" .",
    "this notion is chosen in analogy to the use of  isospectrality \" in other areas of physics , e.  g.  the occurrence of supersymmetric pairs of hamiltonians ( see , e.  g.  @xcite , 7.1 ) or the problem of bounded domains with isospectral laplacians (  can one hear the shape of a drum ? \" @xcite ) .",
    "the subject of isospectral spin systems is not completely novel but has been discussed in the literature only on a few occasions , e.  g.  @xcite , @xcite . however , there is , to our best knowledge , no systematic account of this phenomenon , the first steps of which will be presented in this paper .",
    "+ in addition to providing a general approach to isospectrality we analyze in depth two cases of distinct heisenberg systems where continuous variation of the exchange constants gives rise to one and the same set of temperature - dependent thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the operational conclusion for an experimentalist is quite sobering , in that for these specific systems measured data alone can not fix the exchange constants .",
    "comparison between theory and experiment can only place a weak constraint on a continuous family of equally acceptable choices of parameters .",
    "although we provide some helpful insights , it is very difficult to formulate the general set of conditions to be met so as to achieve such exceptional model systems .",
    "it is reasonable to expect , that if one and the same temperature dependent thermodynamic quantity is generated by a continuous family of hamiltonians then necessarily all members of that family share the very same eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "this is indeed the case as it is proven in section 3 for two particular thermodynamic functions .",
    "+ in short , our goal in the present work is to provide a first systematic study of heisenberg isospectral spin systems .",
    "the remarkable advances @xcite,@xcite in synthesis magnetochemistry , of incorporating significant numbers of interacting paramagnetic centers within individual molecules , may provide the impetus for wider studies that will yield a more comprehensive set of conditions for the occurence of isospectral spin systems .",
    "+ the layout of this paper is as follows : + in section 2 we introduce our notation and the basic concepts of  isospectrality \" ,  complete isospectrality \" , and  covariant isospectrality \" for spin systems with heisenberg hamiltonians .",
    "families of isospectral systems are algebraic varieties in the space @xmath2 of coupling constants .",
    "covariant isospectrality is implemented by a unitary representation of some lie group , which simplifies the calculations considerably . unfortunately this is a rare case , as we will see .",
    "complete isospectrality means that all eigenvalues of two systems with the same magnetic quantum number are in 1:1 correspondence and equal .",
    "we do not know whether this is a strictly stronger property than plain isospectrality , except for the case of a trivial counter - example .",
    "however , we need this apparently stronger concept to derive the conclusion that completely isospectral systems share the same magnetic susceptibility function .",
    "this is done in section 3 where also the inverse problem is settled as well as the analogous question for the specific heat function .",
    "the result in short is the following : plain isospectrality is equivalent to possessing the same specific heat function and necessary for possessing the same magnetic susceptibility function .",
    "complete isospectrality is sufficient for possessing the same magnetic susceptibility function . in section 4",
    "we identify the isospectral invariants which are linear or quadratic in the coupling constants .",
    "this is crucial for section 5 where we show that the triangle with spin @xmath3 is both of completely and covariantly isospectral type but that for @xmath4 isospectrality breaks down . on the other side ,",
    "if the number @xmath5 of spin sites exceeds @xmath6 , covariant isospectrality is no longer possible .",
    "this is proved in section 6 with the aid of mathematica@xmath7 4.0 and some trace formulae which are explained in appendix a. the tetrahedron ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath3 nevertheless possesses completely isospectral families of dimension one and two , as is shown in section 7 and appendix b. in section 8 we provide some heuristic arguments in order to explain the findings of the previous sections .",
    "we expect that isospectrality only occurs if the number of all possible bonds exceeds the number of independent eigenvalues and show that this never happens except for @xmath3 and @xmath9 . a table summarizing our results and conjectures on the occurence of isospectrality for different @xmath5 and @xmath10 and concluding remarks are provided in section 9 .",
    "we consider spin systems with @xmath5 spin sites , spin quantum number @xmath10 and isotropic heisenberg coupling between all sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 with coupling constants @xmath13 . for sake of compact notation",
    "we will write the @xmath14 coupling constants @xmath13 as the components of a vector @xmath15 . thus a specific point of @xmath16 uniquely specifies the strength of the interactions between all pairs of spins and will be sometimes called a  system \" .",
    "+ let @xmath17 denote the three components of the spin observable @xmath18 at site @xmath11 and , as usual , @xmath19 denote the total spin vector and its various components .",
    "all linear operators occuring in this context will be identified with the corresponding @xmath20-matrices , @xmath21 being the dimension of the total hilbert space of the spin system , w.  r.  t.  the fixed basis consisting of tensor products of eigenvectors of @xmath22 .",
    "the hamilton operator can then be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 here @xmath25 is an @xmath14-dimensional vector the components of which are @xmath20-dimensional matrices @xmath26 .",
    "+ if the spin system is coupled to a constant external magnetic field @xmath27 , the total hamilton operator will be @xmath28 where @xmath29 contains the common combination of the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath30 and the bohr magneton @xmath31 .",
    "as usual , the partition function , which yields all the standard thermodynamic functions , is defined by @xmath32 in particular , one obtains from @xmath33 the specific heat function @xmath34 and the magnetic zero field susceptibility function @xmath35 further we will need the traces of powers of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the set of traces @xmath38 two hamilton operators with the same @xmath5 and @xmath10 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are called if they have the same eigenvalues , counted with multiplicity , or , equivalently , if they generate the same characteristic polynomial : @xmath41 according to the above remarks , we will also speak of  isospectral systems \" .",
    "sometimes we will apply the term ",
    "isospectral \" to more general pairs of operators derived from @xmath42 if there is no danger of confusion .",
    "clearly , ( [ 7 ] ) defines an equivalence relation @xmath43 on @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients of a characteristic polynomial @xmath44 can be viewed as polynomials of the coupling constants @xmath13 .",
    "these polynomials assume constant values exactly on the @xmath43-equivalence classes @xmath45_\\sim$ ] , which we will call .",
    "consequently , the isospectral classes are in @xmath16 , since they are defined by a finite number @xmath46 of polynomial equations @xmath47 . or",

    "+ in algebraic geometry there are various equivalent definitions of the of an algebraic variety , which are , however , too technical to be reproduced here ( see , for example , @xcite , chapter 9 ) . for our purposes",
    "it will suffice to note that for the special case where the jacobian matrix @xmath50 has locally a constant rank @xmath51 , the corresponding isospectral classes are locally differentiable manifolds of dimension @xmath52 .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the fibration theorem ( see , for example , @xcite , theorem 3.5.18 ) .",
    "especially , if @xmath53 and the rank of the jacobian is maximal , @xmath54 , the isospectrality classes will only consist of a discrete point set .",
    "note , however , that the equivalence classes will never be trivial since they at least consist of the orbits of the group of discrete symmetries of @xmath16 generated by permutations of spin sites .",
    "+ we will say that the pair @xmath55 is of if the corresponding space of coupling constants @xmath16 contains at least one isospectral equivalence class of dimension @xmath56 .",
    "the largest dimension @xmath57 of isospectral equivalence classes will be called the of the isospectral type .",
    "+ functions @xmath58 which are constant on isospectral classes will be called .",
    "+ moreover , we will consider a special case of isospectrality in which the equivalence classes are easily calculated .",
    "obviously , two isospectral hamiltonians @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be related by a unitary transformation @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath61 maps the eigenvectors of @xmath60 onto the corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath59 . in the case of a one  dimensional isospectral equivalence class parametrized by a coordinate @xmath63 , @xmath61 can be chosen to depend smoothly on @xmath63 . following a closed loop",
    ", the corresponding unitary transformation need not reduce to the identity transformation , but may include some phases .",
    "we will come back to this phenomenon later .",
    "if for sufficiently many curves of isospectrally equivalent points the corresponding unitary transformations @xmath64 can , moreover , be chosen to be a one - parameter group , the system @xmath55 will be called of  covariant isospectral \" type .",
    "more precisely , we define :    @xmath55 is of type iff it is of isospectral type and for any isospectrally equivalent @xmath65 which are sufficiently close , there exists an anti - hermitean @xmath66dim - matrix @xmath67 , and a real @xmath68-matrix @xmath69 and some @xmath70 , such that for all @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73    it follows immediately , that the orbit @xmath74 in @xmath16space corresponds to a family of isospectral hamilton matrices .",
    "since in our case all hamilton matrices are real and symmetric , @xmath67 can also be chosen as real and hence anti ",

    "we will give an independent proof of this fact later .",
    "+ further we note that the set of solutions @xmath79 of ( [ 11 ] ) will be a lie algebra with respect to the obvious vector and commutator operations .",
    "hence covariant isospectral equivalence classes will be orbits of the corresponding matrix lie groups .",
    "+ thus far we have only discussed isospectral systems in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "if we include the field @xmath80 and allow for a corresponding @xmath81-dependence of the hamiltonian , we have to consider a slightly stronger concept of  complete isospectrality \" .",
    "two hamiltonians @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( or , equivalently , two vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) are called ( @xmath84 ) iff for all @xmath85 and @xmath86 are isospectral .",

    "+ a large number of 2-dimensional generic isospectral classes have been identified numerically .",
    "the exceptional classes are one- or zero - dimensional and will be discussed further in appendix b.",
    "in the previous sections we have studied isospectrality for the cases @xmath341 and excluded certain other cases , e.  g.  complete isospectrality for @xmath4 and covariant isospectrality for @xmath300 . however , we have been unable to present a complete list of criteria for the ( non-)occurrence of isospectrality .",
    "what is also missing is some simple and intuitive argument why isospectrality is so rare . as a substitute for a complete theory we will , in this section , provide some heuristic arguments for the ( non-)occurrence of isospectrality which also may give more insight into isospectrality than detailed proofs .",
    "we think that these arguments could be made rigorous as far as necessary conditions for isospectrality in the cases @xmath342 are involved.(see the remarks in section 2 on the dimension of isospectral classes and the fibration theorem . )",
    "however , a detailed proof would require technical issues from the theory of algebraic varieties which are beyond the scope of this article and , moreover , would appear as superfluous given that isospectrality in some of these cases has already been proven by case inspection .",
    "+ the heuristic argument goes as follows : isospectrality will ( only ) occur if the number @xmath343 of bonds between spin pairs exceeds the number @xmath344 of independent eigenvalues of @xmath36 . in this case ,",
    "typically the systems corresponding to an @xmath345-dimensional sub - variety of @xmath16 will possess the same eigenvalues . the argument",
    "may even be applied if one is not aware of all relations among the eigenvalues which determine @xmath344 . in such a case of unknown relations one",
    "would perhaps over - estimate @xmath344 and hence under - estimate the dimension @xmath346 of the isospectrality classes but , depending on the case , one could correctly predict the occurrence of isospectrality .",
    "+ when counting the number @xmath344 of independent eigenvalues one first has to consider the @xmath347-fold degeneracy dictated by the rotational invariance of @xmath36 . in the simplest example",
    ", one has to couple @xmath348 spins @xmath3 , obtaining one triplet and one singlet as eigenspaces of @xmath36 , symbolically @xmath349 .",
    "thus there are not four , but only two independent eigenvalues of @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath241 one has @xmath350 , hence @xmath6 independent eigenvalues . in the latter case",
    "there are @xmath351 bonds .",
    "thus the heuristic argument does not yet explain isospectrality with @xmath352-dimensional classes .",
    "however , it is easy to find a  missing relation \" among the eigenvalues which reduces the number of independent eigenvalues to @xmath353 : it is just the relation @xmath354 which yields a linear relation of the form @xmath355 between the eigenvalues @xmath356 .",
    "+ for @xmath3 and arbitrary @xmath5 it can be shown that there are exactly @xmath357 independent eigenvalues due to rotational degeneracy and hence , considering @xmath354 , @xmath358 . in this manner",

    ", this does not strictly exclude isospectrality for those cases , but makes it very unlikely in our opinion .",
    "+ there is another aspect which shows up in table 1 and which we now discuss : note that for @xmath8 the difference between the numbers in the 3rd and the 2nd column , @xmath374 , would only explain one - dimensional isospectrality classes , whereas we have encountered two - dimensional classes in section 7 .",
    "this indicates that the correct @xmath344 should be @xmath251 , not @xmath361 , and that there is a further  missing relation \" between the eigenvalues of @xmath36 , comparable to @xmath375 .",
    "indeed , as shown in the following paragraph , there holds a general property of the eigenvalues of arbitrary heisenberg hamiltonians @xmath36 corresponding to the distribution of the eigenvalues among the quantum numbers @xmath376 .",
    "+ let , as above , denote by @xmath377 the projector onto the eigenspace of @xmath98 with the eigenvalue @xmath378 .",

    "this gives a number of @xmath386 independent linear equations for the eigenvalues of @xmath36 .",
    "of course , @xmath387 is a consequence of these equations and must not be counted seperately . for @xmath388",
    "we obtain @xmath389 independent equations , which explains the two - dimensional classes for @xmath8 we found in section 7 , and predicts , at least , two - dimensional classes for the case @xmath390 not yet analyzed in detail .",

    "however , we will not further pursue this question here .",
    "we summarize our results in table 3 .",
    "it is in order to add some remarks on the possibility of determining the coupling constants @xmath393 .",
    "our results on the limits of uniquely determining the values of @xmath393 in the case of isospectrality does not mean that these values could not be determined otherwise .",
    "first , we did not consider thermodynamical functions which do not come solely from the partition function , such as correlation functions , etc .",
    "second , we do not adhere to a positivistic attitude which would in principle deny the physical reality of unmeasurable quantities . as in other domains of physics , these parameters could also be determined with the aid of additional assumptions , e.  g.  based on the symmetry of the molecules and supported by chemical considerations , which although plausible have not been confirmed directly .",
