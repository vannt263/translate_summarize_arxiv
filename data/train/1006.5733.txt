    "the statistical behavior of chaotic wave functions has been a key topic of investigation from the early history of quantum chaos and wave chaos physics , and its study is essential for improved understanding of resonances , transport , and long - time dynamics in non - integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "the standard method of determining the statistics of the eigenstates and eigenvalues of any physical hamiltonian is by direct diagonalization . on the other hand",
    ", the semiclassical ergodic hypothesis  @xcite suggests that the statistics of chaotic eigenstates in the semiclassical limit are universal : just as a typical trajectory in a classically chaotic system uniformly covers the entire energy hypersurface in phase space , independently of the detailed dynamics , so should a typical eigenstate in the corresponding quantum system be fully spread over the available hilbert space .",
    "such behavior follows naturally from random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite , which describes a statistical ensemble of gaussian - random hamiltonians having no preferred basis . within the rmt approximation , eigenstates are random vectors either in the full hilbert space or in the subspace given by energy and other conservation laws . for a quantum particle in a slowly - varying potential ,",
    "a typical wave function then behaves locally like a random superposition of plane waves of fixed wave number , as discussed by berry  @xcite .",
    "rmt wave function statistics have been well confirmed as a good zeroth - order approximation for a variety of physical systems in the absence of integrability .",
    "the related `` quantum chaos conjecture ''  @xcite which states that the _ spectra _ of individual classically chaotic systems also obey rmt statistics in the semiclassical limit , is similarly well established experimentally and numerically .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in deriving this result analytically , starting form a periodic orbit representation  @xcite .    as a universal theory , rmt specifically excludes system - specific behavior associated with short - time dynamics , boundary conditions , or interactions .",
    "well - recognized deviations from random wave function statistics are associated with boundary effects  @xcite , finite system size  @xcite , unstable periodic orbits  @xcite , diffusion  @xcite , and two - body random interactions in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "similar deviations from rmt spectral statistics have also been long recognized  @xcite , and are known to arise from non - universal short - time dynamics  @xcite .",
    "much progress has been made in understanding such deviations in specific situations of physical interest , for example chaotic wave function correlations in husimi space associated with classical dynamics  @xcite and realistic mesoscopic s - matrices arising from a diffusive ray picture of wave propagation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , semiclassical methods  @xcite have proven successful in quantifying the effects on wave functions of boundaries  @xcite and periodic orbit scars  @xcite .",
    "however the limit implied by semiclassical approximations may not always be achievable or relevant in describing actual experiments .",
    "for example , an analysis of electron interaction matrix elements in ballistic quantum dots shows that even for thousands of electrons in the dot , several important statistical quantities typically exceed random wave predictions by a factor of 3 ; for other quantities the random wave model even fails to predict the correct sign  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this failure of the random wave picture has important implications for interpretation of conductance experiments in the coulomb blockade regime .    in some situations , e.g. ,  @xcite , brute force diagonalization of the hamiltonian",
    "may be used to obtain correct statistics for the stationary or long - time behavior , but for very large hilbert spaces , such as those that arise in many - body situations , @xmath0 matrix diagonalization is often impractical , due to the @xmath1 scaling . even where it `` works '' , diagonalization is unlikely to produce any intuition about the relevant physics , and must be repeated for each new hamiltonian .",
    "perturbation theory addresses this situation , but only when the change in the hamiltonian is small compared to the mean level spacing . in fact , individual eigenstates of a chaotic hamiltonian are highly sensitive to perturbations of the system , particularly in multi - particle systems .",
    "the _ statistics _ of such systems are much more robust and remain accurate for moderate perturbations . for these reasons ,",
    "a method of predicting wave function statistics for a family of hamiltonians , similar in form but containing non - trivial perturbations , is highly desirable .    here",
    "we present a system- and basis - independent means of supplementing rmt with short time dynamical information , an area in which little has been done systematically despite it being well known that rmt ignores dynamical effects .",
    "our method , introduced previously in abbreviated form  @xcite , eliminates the need for diagonalization of the hamiltonian , while providing greatly improved accuracy over standard rmt and semiclassical methods for finite systems with a finite ehrenfest time . instead of treating rmt and non - universal short - time behavior separately ,",
    "we show that they can be naturally combined to produce useful quantitative predictions about wave function statistics in realistic non - integrable systems .",
    "below , we apply our techniques to eigenstate intensity auto - correlations and two - point correlations , as they are the simplest nontrivial moments of the eigenstates .",
    "physically , these represent the average return probability for a given initial state and the average transport probability between a pair of states .",
    "our method is easily extendable to other moments of the eigenstate probability distribution .",
    "similarly , while we focus on the behavior of eigenstates in the position or gaussian wave - packet ( husimi ) representation , the method applies equally well to eigenstate statistics in the momentum basis ( of interest for scattering problems ) or in any other representation .    a useful way to think about",
    "the relationship between real non - integrable dynamical systems and rmt is that in a real dynamical system , a generic initial wave packet spreads ( e.g. , exponentially with a rate given by the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath2 if the hamiltonian is chaotic ) , and eventually covers the entire available hilbert space of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "this occurs after the ehrenfest time @xmath4 for a ballistic chaotic system .",
    "for a diffusive dynamics , the analogous time scale is the thouless time @xmath5 ( the time required to spread diffusively over the system  @xcite ) , which is proportional to the square of the sample size .",
    "rmt , on the other hand , assumes that this randomization takes place instantaneously , and the behavior is universal for all times @xmath6 .",
    "thus , rmt corresponds to a non - integrable system with an infinite lyapunov exponent ( @xmath7 ) , or zero ehrenfest or thouless time .",
    "a lyapunov exponent of infinity , as implied by rmt , represents an explosion .",
    "the initial state is instantly destroyed and randomly redistributed across the entire system after a single step regardless of the the details of the system .",
    "clearly this is not physically realistic , but it is often a useful approximation for several reasons .",
    "firstly , for highly chaotic systems , @xmath2 is large , and the rmt predictions are quite accurate .",
    "secondly the predictions of rmt for many quantities are computationally simple .",
    "it is often preferable to accept the errors of rmt in order to avoid the computational difficulty of brute force diagonalization .",
    "thirdly , in the case of _ spectral _ statistics , rmt fails only on large energy scales ( corresponding to times shorter than @xmath8 or @xmath5 ) , and it is entirely justified to apply rmt inside energy windows of size less than the thouless energy @xmath9 ( e.g. , in the study of level spacing statistics ) . the situation with wave functions is not so simple , as short - time dynamical effects leave an imprint at arbitrarily long times , and inevitably lead to large deviations from rmt not only for energy - averaged quasimodes but also for individual eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "to enable direct comparison with rmt , let us consider fully chaotic ( ballistic or diffusive ) dynamics without symmetry on an @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space with eigenstates @xmath10 . to avoid ambiguities in the definition of @xmath10",
    ", we assume a non - degenerate spectrum .",
    "typical quantities of interest , then , are functions of the amplitudes @xmath11 for any physically - motivated basis state @xmath12 , which may be a position or momentum state , a slater determinant for many - body systems , or more generally an eigenstate of some zeroth - order hamiltonian . given the normalization condition @xmath13 , the simplest and first non - trivial moment of these amplitudes is given by the local inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , which measures the degree of localization at @xmath12 : @xmath14 varying from @xmath15 in the case of perfect delocalization to @xmath16 for perfect localization .",
    "for two arbitrary states we similarly define @xmath17 a measure of intensity - intensity correlation .",
    "these quantities are directly related to the time - averaged return probability and transport probability , @xmath18 and @xmath19 as may be easily verified by inserting two complete sets of states @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ paa2 ] ) or ( [ pab2 ] ) .    in the more general case of a time - periodic hamiltonian @xmath21 , to be considered in the numerical examples below , eigenstates",

    "( [ paa2 ] ) and ( [ pab2 ] ) are replaced by discrete sums with time step @xmath24 .    obviously ,",
    "higher - order moments of the eigenstate intensities @xmath25 , and in general the entire joint distribution of the intensities , may be considered ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) in similar fashion .",
    "we may also relax the requirement that only pure states such as @xmath26 act as probes , and instead measure the structure of chaotic eigenstates using any desired self - adjoint operator @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "operator probes ( of phase space size greater than or smaller than @xmath28 ) will , for example , be particularly helpful in the study of hierarchical eigenstates in a mixed chaotic - regular phase space  @xcite .",
    "again , without loss of generality we may adopt the normalization @xmath29 .",

    "may be obtained using short - time dynamics .",

    "the cutoff time @xmath41 must be long compared to the ballistic or diffusive thouless time @xcite ( so as to include all the non - universal dynamics ) , and short compared to the heisenberg time , which scales with the effective hilbert space dimension @xmath3 .",
    "importantly , no distinction is made in eq .",
    "( [ pabsclimit ] ) between non - universal short - time revivals that indicate deviations from rmt in the eigenstate statistics and the @xmath42 short - time revivals that are present already in the context of rmt .",
