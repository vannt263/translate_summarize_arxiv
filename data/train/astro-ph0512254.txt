    "the relative position of the companion , b ( @xmath9 , spt = ) , was first recorded by william herschel in 1782 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has not changed much since , indicating the physical association between the stars .",
    "an investigation by @xcite included this and many other physical pairs composed of a b - type and a late - type component to establish the absolute magnitudes of the primaries by reference to the better known magnitudes of the secondaries .",
    "since the b stars must be relatively young , the  system was included also in a study by @xcite that concluded that many of the secondaries in such pairs are post - t tauri stars , and show other indicators of youth such as h and k emission , h@xmath10 emission , strong li  @xmath16708 absorption , strong x - rays , infrared excess , or a location in the h - r diagram above the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the age of a was estimated to be 123 myr by comparison with stellar evolution models .",
    "b was reported to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary by @xcite , and independently by @xcite .",
    "both teams detected significant li  @xmath16708 absorption .",
    "the spectroscopic orbit of the binary with a period of 17.6 days and an eccentricity of 0.3 was first derived by @xcite , who pointed out also that the residuals clearly indicated the presence of a third , rather massive star in the system with a period of a few years .",
    "the elements of the double - lined orbit were published by @xcite , along with a preliminary solution for the outer orbit for which @xmath070% of the estimated 8-year cycle was covered .",
    "this fit allowed those authors to confirm that the mass of the third star is larger than either of the objects in the inner pair , despite there being no sign of it in their spectra .",
    "we report here our own spectroscopic observations of b giving full coverage of the outer orbit over more than two cycles .",
    "we model the properties of the system and find compelling evidence that the third star is itself a close binary , making the  system at least quintuple .",
    "spectroscopic observations of b were conducted at the cfa between september 1988 and december 2004 ( with a 6-year gap from march 1990 to november 1996 ) mostly with an echelle spectrograph on the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory ( harvard , massachusetts ) .",
    "a single order was recorded with an intensified reticon diode array giving a spectral coverage of about 45  at a central wavelength of 5187 .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath11 .",
    "occasional observations were made also with nearly identical instruments on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the f.l .",
    "whipple observatory ( mt .  hopkins , arizona ) and the multiple mirror telescope ( also on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona ) , prior to its conversion to a monolithic mirror .",
    "a total of 72 spectra were collected , including one archival observation taken at the tillinghast reflector much earlier for a different program ( october 1983 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of these observations range from 10 to 40 per resolution element of 8.5  .",
    "the double - lined nature of the system is evident already in our first ( archival ) spectrum from 1983 .",
    "radial velocities were derived from all our observations using todcor @xcite , a two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm well suited to our relatively low s / n spectra .",
    "todcor uses two templates , one for each component of the binary ( hereafter stars ba and bb ) , and significantly reduces systematics due to line blending that are often unavoidable in standard one - dimensional cross - correlation techniques ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the templates were selected from a large library of synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.  kurucz ( available at http://cfaku5.cfa.harvard.edu ) , computed for us by jon morse ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculated spectra are available for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath12 ) , projected rotational velocities ( @xmath13 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath14 ) and metallicities .",
    "experience has shown that radial velocities are largely insensitive to the surface gravity and metallicity adopted for the templates .",
    "consequently , the optimum template for each star was determined from grids of cross - correlations over broad ranges in temperature and rotational velocity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , seeking to maximize the average correlation weighted by the strength of each exposure .",
    "solar metallicity was assumed to begin with , along with surface gravities of @xmath15 for both stars , appropriate for dwarfs .",
    "we obtained best fit values for the temperatures of 6180  k and 5620  k for the primary and secondary , respectively , with estimated uncertainties of 150  k. these correspond to spectral types of f8 and g6 @xcite .",
    "the rotational broadening of the stars was found to be very small ( formally @xmath16  for both stars ) , consistent with the estimates by @xcite of @xmath17  and 0  for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "we repeated the procedure for metallicities between [ m / h ] = @xmath18 and [ m / h ] = @xmath19 , in steps of 0.5 dex , and found the best match to be for solar composition .",
    "this is consistent with the results presented in ",
    "[ sec : system ] .",
    "following @xcite , we determined also the light ratio between the secondary and the primary of b at the mean wavelength of our spectroscopic observations ( 5187 ) , which is close to the @xmath20 band : @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude difference @xmath22 , and agrees well with the independent estimate by @xcite of @xmath23 .",
    "table  [ tab : rvcfa ] lists the radial velocities for both components , referred to the heliocentric frame .",
    "typical uncertainties are given below .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small systematic run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the cfa velocity system , which is within about 0.14  of the reference frame defined by minor planets in the solar system , is documented in the previous citation and also by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the original motivation for our early observations ( prior to march 1990 ) was to investigate systematic errors in the determination of radial velocities for early - type versus late - type stars by using physical pairs such as ab ( d.  latham 2005 , priv .",
    "although it was soon realized that no meaningful velocities could be obtained for the early - type star with our instrumentation , the double - lined nature of the secondary was certainly noticed and was the reason for collecting nearly 30 spectra up to that date .",
    "however , no orbit was published at the time .",
    "after the implementation of the todcor algorithm at the cfa there was renewed interest in the object as a potentially young system , and observations were resumed in late 1996 .",
    "it then became obvious that the center of mass of the 17.6-day binary was changing in response to an additional component , and the system was monitored more regularly to complete the outer orbit .",
    "only later did we learn of the independent efforts by @xcite revealing the same trend .    an orbital solution based on all cfa spectra",
    "is presented in the second column of table  [ tab : orbit ] .",
    "because the outer period is much longer than the inner period , we have assumed to first order that the hierarchical triple system may be separated into an inner orbit and an outer orbit , the latter being treated as a `` binary '' composed of the third star ( bc ) and the center of mass of the inner pair ( ba  bb ) .",
    "both orbits were solved simultaneously ( 12 adjustable parameters ) using standard iterative non - linear least - squares methods . in particular",
    ", we applied the levenberg - marquardt technique , which is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the iterations converged quickly to the final solution , and experiments in which we varied the initial values of the elements within reason yielded the same results .",
    "although the light travel time effect is small , we have included the appropriate corrections for the inner pair .",
    "these depend on the orbital elements , so they were iterated during the solution .",
    "the outer orbit has a period of 9.4 years , and our data cover 2.2 cycles .",
    "the rms residual of the observations , indicative of the precision of the radial velocities , is 0.59  for ba and 1.03  for bb .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the observations reported originally by @xcite do not quite cover a full cycle of the outer orbit .",
    "those measurements were made with a coravel - type radial - velocity spectrometer on the 0.7-m telescope at moscow university and the 1-m telescope at the simeis observatory in crimea , and have a precision similar to ours .",
    "the observations with this instrument were continued after publication , and the authors were kind enough to provide us with an updated list of their rvm velocities for ba and bb .",
    "these observations are presented with their permission in table  [ tab : rvtok ] , and now cover nearly one full cycle of the outer orbit .",
    "an independent orbital solution from these data is given in the third column of table  [ tab : orbit ] .",
    "there is excellent agreement with the cfa solution for all of the orbital elements .",
    "therefore we have combined the measurements , allowing for a possible velocity offset between the two data sets by incorporating an additional adjustable parameter ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the relative weighting of the observations was determined by iterations separately for the primary and secondary components in each data set , based on the scatter of the measurements . for the rvm velocities",
    "it was found that the original internal errors ( table  [ tab : rvtok ] ) required the application of scaling factors of 2.3 and 1.7 to achieve reduced @xmath25 values near unity for stars ba and bb , respectively .",
    "the combined cfa+rvm solution is listed in the final column of table  [ tab : orbit ] .",
    "residuals for the individual cfa and rvm observations from this fit are given in table  [ tab : rvcfa ] and table  [ tab : rvtok ] .",
    "the light travel corrections applied to the dates of the inner pair appear in the last column ( the julian dates shown are the original values , without corrections ) .",
    "phases in the inner and outer orbits are also given .",
    "the radial velocities in the inner orbit are presented graphically in figure  [ fig : inner ] , where the motion of the center of mass in the wide orbit has been subtracted from the individual primary and secondary velocities .",
    "similarly , the velocities in the outer orbit are shown in figure  [ fig : outer ] both as a function of phase and time , with the motion in the inner orbit removed .",
    "the period of the wide orbit , @xmath26 yr , is formally determined with a relative precision better than 0.2% .",
    "it is of interest to note that the lines of apsides of the inner and outer orbits appear to be nearly perfectly aligned , according to our solution in table  [ tab : orbit ] : the difference between the longitudes of periastron @xmath27 and @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "this is unlikely to be accidental , and is presumably a result of dynamical interactions in the triple system .",
    "the outer period happens to be very close to an integer multiple of the inner period ( @xmath30 ) , although the formal uncertainty in this ratio ( 0.32 ) is large enough that it is not particularly significant .",
    "an improvement in @xmath31 by an order of magnitude would be needed for a more definitive conclusion . of greater interest ,",
    "as reported by @xcite , is the fact that the mass function ( or , equivalently , the minimum mass of the unseen companion of b ) is unusually large . for any reasonable values of the masses of ba and bb ( see below ) the inferred mass of bc is larger than either ba or bb , yet no light from the third star is obvious in our spectra .",
    "@xcite made an attempt to detect bc spectroscopically by obtaining strong exposures at the phases of maximum velocity separation between ba and bb .",
    "no sign of the third star was seen , and they estimated it must be at least 5 times fainter than bb .",
    "we made a similar attempt using our cfa spectra , by reprocessing all of them with an extension of the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm todcor to three dimensions @xcite .",
    "again we failed to detect star bc .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , one possibility is that bc is obscured by circumstellar dust .",
    "this would require at least 2 to 3 magnitudes of extinction in the visible to account for our inability to see it .",
    "alternatively , bc could itself be a pair of late - type stars , or perhaps a massive white dwarf .",
    "we examine these possibilities further below .",
    "as mentioned in  [ sec : introduction ] , measurements of the relative position of a and b over the past 200 years ( some 70 observations to date ) show that this is a physical pair  mas  yr@xmath32 @xcite , enough to have changed the separation by more than 5  in 200 years if b were a background star . ] , with only a very slight indication of change suggesting perhaps orbital motion .",
    "radial velocities for the brighter star have been measured occasionally but show significant scatter , possibly due to the large rotational broadening that makes those measurements difficult ( @xmath13 measures have ranged between 225  and 340  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a representative average of the radial velocity measures of a has been given by @xcite as @xmath33  .",
    "this is consistent with the center - of - mass velocity of b ( @xmath34  ; table  [ tab : orbit ] ) , supporting the physical association .",
    "no trigonometric parallax determination is available for b , but a does have an entry in the hipparcos catalog @xcite and the measured parallax is @xmath35  milli - arc seconds ( mas ) corresponding to a distance of about 82  pc .    the brightness of both a and b has been measured separately in a variety of photometric systems .",
    "the primary is listed in the hipparcos catalog as an ` unsolved variable ' , with a variability amplitude of @xmath36  mag in the @xmath37 passband .",
    "no other mention of variability could be found in the literature .",
    "the secondary was reported as marginally variable by @xcite with a maximum change of @xmath38  mag based on 4 measurements",
    ". however , no variability appears to have been detected by @xcite or @xcite from more intensive measurements in several passbands . for our purposes",
    "we assume that neither the primary nor the secondary of the visual pair are significantly variable in brightness .    adopting the hipparcos distance of a for the system , along with johnson @xmath20-band photometry as compiled by @xcite and @xmath39 , based on 9 and 29 individual measurements , respectively .",
    "we assign an uncertainty of 0.01 mag to these values . ] and our light ratio @xmath40 in  [ sec : spectroscopy ] , we computed absolute visual magnitudes for the three visible stars : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the errors here are dominated by the uncertainty in the parallax .",
    "temperatures for stars ba and bb were given in ",
    "[ sec : spectroscopy ] ( @xmath44  k and @xmath45  k ) . for a",
    "we have used absolute photometry in the johnson , strmgren , and geneva systems @xcite to derive the effective temperature based on a large number of color / temperature calibrations @xcite .",
    "the various estimates are in good agreement , and yield an average of @xmath46  k , where the uncertainty is a conservative estimate to account for possible systematics .",
    "@xcite obtained results consistent with ours .",
    "reddening estimates based on geneva and strmgren photometry give negligible values using calibrations by @xcite and @xcite , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then used the absolute visual magnitudes and temperatures of the three visible stars to compare their location in the h - r diagram with stellar evolution models from the yonsei - yale series @xcite .",
    "we performed a grid search and tested a large number of isochrones over a range of metal abundances and ages . for each metallicity",
    "/ age combination we varied the masses of the stars , seeking the best match to the observables . with the additional constraint on the mass ratio for b ( @xmath47 ) , or equivalently",
    "the minimum masses of the components ( @xmath48 ; see table  [ tab : orbit ] ) , we reduced the problem to one of finding the best values of @xmath49 and the inclination of the inner orbit ( @xmath50 ) for each age / metallicity combination .",
    "the result of this grid search is illustrated in figure  [ fig : metage ] , where the dots represent models that agree with the observations within the errors .",
    "the best fit isochrone has a metallicity of @xmath51 and an age of 200  myr , with uncertainties estimated to be roughly 0.005 in @xmath52 ( or 0.1 dex in [ fe / h ] ) and 50  myr for the age .",
    "the agreement with the measured magnitudes and temperatures is excellent ( better than 0.1  mag and 20  k for all three stars , which is well within the errors ) .",
    "the metallicity is very close to the solar value in these models ( @xmath53 ) and corresponds to [ fe / h ] = @xmath54 .",
    "this is consistent with our crude estimate in ",
    "[ sec : spectroscopy ] , and is also not far from the independent spectroscopic determination for b by @xcite of [ fe / h ] = @xmath55 , which , however , may be affected by the double - lined nature of the object .",
    "the age we infer is somewhat older than previous estimates , partly due to differences in the models : @xcite estimated 123  myr , and @xcite derived 180190  myr .    the mass of star a is determined to be @xmath56  m@xmath57 and the inclination angle of the ba ",
    "bb orbit is @xmath58 . as a result",
    "the individual masses in b are @xmath59  m@xmath57 and @xmath60  m@xmath57 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : metage ] shows that the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fairly tightly constrained , as are the age and chemical composition .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] displays the observations and best - fit isochrone in the @xmath61/@xmath12 diagram ( dashed line ) .    as a check one may compare the observations with the predictions from this model for the brightness of the stars in other passbands not used in the adjustment , in particular in the near - infrared . observed magnitudes for a and b in the @xmath62 passbands are available from the 2mass catalog , which we have converted to the johnson system of @xcite for consistency with the isochrone computations , using transformations by @xcite .",
    "we find that the isochrone reproduces the near - infrared colors of a fairly well , as seen in the top third of table  [ tab : irmags ] .",
    "the differences in the last column are mostly within the observational errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the predictions for b ( combined light of stars ba and bb , as observed by 2mass ) disagree with the observations in the sense that the measured colors are redder , and the discrepancy increases toward longer wavelengths reaching nearly 6@xmath63 for @xmath64 ( see middle section of table  [ tab : irmags ] ) .",
    "this is strongly suggestive of a near - infrared excess for b , which in all likelihood is related to the unseen companion .",
    "the presence of an infrared excess may appear to support the idea advanced by @xcite that star bc is perhaps surrounded by a dust disk that is obscuring the star and preventing its direct detection .",
    "however , given the age of the system ( @xmath0200  myr ) , the possibility that it harbors a circumstellar disk substantial enough to produce 23 magnitudes of optical extinction ( see  [ sec : orbit ] ) is highly unlikely , since such disks in t tauri stars are known to dissipate after @xmath010  myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the age and infrared excess also rule out the possibility that star bc is a massive white dwarf .",
    "we are left with the hypothesis that it is instead a binary composed of late - type dwarfs , and we explore this here by attempting to model the infrared excess using theoretical isochrones .",
    "even though the yonsei - yale isochrones used above reach masses as low as 0.4  m@xmath57 , they are not specifically intended for the lower main - sequence and are thus not expected to reproduce the radiative properties of real m dwarfs as closely as needed for our purposes .",
    "other series of models are available that are designed for low - mass stars and incorporate a more realistic equation of state , more complete tables of molecular opacities , and non - grey boundary conditions , all of which have been shown to be critical for this regime ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in particular , the @xcite models have been found to match the observed colors of late - type objects fairly well .",
    "however , they are not publicly available for the full range of stellar masses we require , and the range of metallicities available is also limited . due to the latter restriction , we adopt in the following the solar composition for , which is well within the uncertainties of our determination in the previous section . at this metallicity ,",
    "the best match to the magnitudes and temperatures of the three visible stars using the yonsei - yale models is 240  myr , which is also within the errors and which we adopt hereafter .",
    "this solar - metallicity/240-myr isochrone is shown with a solid line in figure  [ fig : hr ] , and is nearly indistinguishable from the @xmath65/200-myr model ( dashed line ) near the observations .",
    "a further complication for our modeling of the infrared excess has to do with the mixing length parameter , @xmath66 .",
    "the value adopted by @xcite for solar - type stars is @xmath67 , which is the best fit to the properties of the sun .",
    "this value is presumably also appropriate for stars ba and bb in , which are close to a solar mass .",
    "however , these models only reach as low as 0.6  m@xmath57 for this @xmath66 , and may limit our predictions for bc if the components are even smaller . for lower - mass stars",
    "@xcite adopt a different mixing length of @xmath68 ( with the rest of the physics in the models being the same ) , which has been found to give satisfactory results in modeling the colors of these objects even down to the brown dwarf regime , but does not reproduce the properties of solar - type stars .",
    "therefore , we proceeded as follows : we first used an isochrone with the higher value of @xmath66 to determine the masses of stars ba and bb that provide the best match to their effective temperatures and absolute visual magnitudes . these masses and the corresponding infrared colors ( which are similar to our previous results using the yonsei - yale models )",
    "were then held fixed , and a @xcite isochrone with the same age and metallicity but with @xmath69 was used to explore which combination of masses for the individual components of bc gives the best match to the observed values of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath64 when adding also the light of ba and bb .",
    "the observed colors were converted to the cit system of @xcite for consistency with the passbands of these isochrones , following @xcite .",
    "the masses of the bc components are not completely arbitrary : their sum is constrained by the mass function in the outer orbit ( see table  [ tab : orbit ] ) , but depends also on the inclination angle of that orbit ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "therefore , we performed a grid search varying @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( the mass ratio between the secondary and the primary of bc ) over wide ranges , seeking to reproduce the colors .",
    "the best match was found for @xmath74 and equal - mass stars ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the corresponding masses for the bc components are 0.70  m@xmath57 each .",
    "these parameters reproduce the combined near - infrared colors of b very well , as seen in the lower part of table  [ tab : irmags ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] we show a contour plot of the @xmath25 surface corresponding to the two fitted variables .",
    "the inferred visual brightness of each star in bc is @xmath76 , which is about 3.7  mag fainter than star ba , and explains why neither we nor @xcite were able to detect them spectroscopically .",
    "the location of bc in the h - r diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "our modeling of the infrared excess of b shows that the unseen and over - massive third star is well explained as an equal - mass binary composed of late - type stars of @xmath77  m@xmath57 ( spectral type approximately k4 ) . as indicated above",
    ", the alignment of the major axes of the inner ( ba  bb ) and outer ( bab  bc ) orbits in this qquadruple system as evidenced by the nearly identical longitudes of periastron is a sign that dynamical interactions are at play .",
    "our estimates of the inclination angles of the two orbits ( @xmath50 and @xmath78 ) provide some information on the relative inclination angle @xmath79 , which is of considerable dynamical importance .",
    "that angle is given by @xmath80 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the position angles of the nodes ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are unknown , so we can only set limits to @xmath83 between @xmath84 and + 1 , which leads to @xmath85 .",
    "a lower limit to @xmath79 can thus be placed at @xmath86 , which appears to exclude coplanarity .    with our estimates of @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath78 the total mass of b is 3.6  m@xmath57 .",
    "the angular semimajor axis of the wide orbit in this system is therefore @xmath87  mas , corresponding to 6.86  au .",
    "given the eccentricity and orientation of the orbit , the angular separation can be as large as 90  mas at times .",
    "the combined brightness of the stars in bc is expected to be approximately 3.3  mag fainter than ba+bb in @xmath20 , which should make it feasible to resolve bc , e.g. , by the speckle interferometry technique in the visible on a 4-m class telescope .",
    "the brightness difference in the @xmath88 band is even more favorable ( @xmath89  mag ) band using the 6-m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory in zelenchuk , russia .",
    "the companion was not resolved : the resolution limit was 90  mas , and the predicted separation according to our orbit was about 60  mas . ] .",
    "perhaps one of the most intriguing properties of b is the presence of strong li  @xmath16708 absorption , as reported originally by @xcite , suggesting the star is young .",
    "this motivated a number of studies to explore the possibility that it is a post - t tauri star .",
    "the equivalent width of the li line was found to be @xmath90  mby @xcite and 152  m  by @xcite , although no account of the double - lined nature of the star was made in these measurements .",
    "@xcite also reported that no h and k emission is seen in b , and that the h@xmath10 line is in absorption , which is somewhat unusual for a pre - main sequence object .",
    "neither of the two visual components have been detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "other than the near - infrared excess discussed in the present work , which is adequately explained by binary nature for bc , no additional excess at longer wavelengths has been seen in b. although the iras satellite detected flux at 12@xmath91 m ( but not at 25@xmath91 m , 60@xmath91 m , or 100@xmath91 m ) , that flux is consistent with being of photospheric origin and does not suggest any substantial amount of dust @xcite .",
    "more sensitive observations by these authors at 850@xmath91 m yielded no detection of b. with this evidence and the fact that the age of the system as estimated from the b - type primary is more typical of zams stars , most studies have concluded that b is not a post - t tauri star .",
    "we support this conclusion , and our age is in fact even older than previous estimates .",
    "the presence of a strong li line is a necessary but not sufficient condition for youth , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "in fact , this feature is sometimes strong in evolved rs  cvn binaries and in other old stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and others ) , which is considered to be a result of the interplay between rotation and the properties of the convective envelopes in these stars , as described in the previous references .",
    "thus , while typical of very young stars , the strength of the li line in b is not exceptional for older objects .    from the evidence presented here",
    "at least five components are known in the  system .",
    "the b - type star itself has been examined for duplicity by the lunar occultation technique @xcite but was found to be unresolved .",
    "we note , however , that the hipparcos catalog lists the star as a ` suspected non - single ' @xcite based on the quality of the astrometric solution , although no convincing non - single star solution was found .",
    "the radial velocity measurements of a are too few in number and too poor in quality to be of much help in this regard .",
    "thus , it is still possible that additional components are present , making this a very interesting multiple system .",
