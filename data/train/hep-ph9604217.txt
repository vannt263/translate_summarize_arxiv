    "chiral perturbation theory , the low - energy limit of the strong interactions  @xcite among other things predicts scattering lengths as well as higher threshold parameters of scattering .",
    "standard one - loop chiral perturbation theory predicts , for instance , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "a generalized version  @xcite predicts larger values for @xmath7 and is related to the question of small quark condensates in qcd ; two - loop scattering amplitudes in this framework were recently presented  @xcite in addition to a field - theoretic calculation in the standard chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .    a revival of interest in scattering and the underlying theory and assumptions has been recently witnessed  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the method of roy equation analysis of basdevant , frogatt and petersen ( bfp )  @xcite has been reimplemented in order to analyse scattering data with @xmath7 chosen to lie in the range favored by standard chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the end product of the bfp method is the availability of a parametric representation for the absorptive parts of the three lowest waves @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the region @xmath13 .",
    "however the roy equations extend over the entire energy domain of scattering and involves all partial waves : the information content of these is modeled in terms of the known resonances such as what is now called the @xmath14  @xcite ( an @xmath15 , @xmath16 state ) [ but we will refer to this as @xmath17 in accordance with bfp ] and in terms of regge phenomenology which then supply the _ driving terms _ to the roy equations of the s- and p- waves .",
    "bfp appeal to such a model and present simple polynomial fits to the driving terms . the availability of the polynomial fits to the s- and p- wave driving terms yields sharp predictions for certain ( combinations ) of s- and p- wave threshold parameters that are correlated with the choice of @xmath7 that was input in the recent roy equation analysis  @xcite .",
    "roy equations may also be written down for the higher waves and solved in a manner discussed by bfp and one may evaluate the d - waves in the threshold region and obtain the d- wave scattering lengths : however the availability of a parameteric representation of the three lowest waves essentially contains all the information required to compute these scattering lengths , with the higher wave and high energy contributions coming from the appropriate limits of the d- wave driving terms .",
    "the latter are not available in the literature which prevented a sharp evaluation of these scattering lengths that are correlated with @xmath7 in the range favored by standard chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compute precisely such driving term contributions to the d- ( and f- ) wave scattering lengths from the model of bfp .",
    "the d- and f- wave scattering lengths belong to a class of ( combinations of ) threshold parameters that are crucial in testing the predictions of chiral perturbation theory ; as accurate a determination of such quantities as possible is therefore desirable . since experimental numbers for these",
    "are in fact extracted from dispersion relation phenomenology , it is important to have a handle on the relative contributions of the low energy s- and p- waves and that of the medium and high energy tails to the relevant dispersion integrals .    in the following",
    "we will recall the basis of the dispersion relation analysis of roy followed by a description of the bfp model , the details of which in ref .",
    "@xcite are somewhat sketchy .",
    "the first step therefore is to reconstruct the bfp model ; in order to establish the reconstruction we compute the s- and p- wave driving terms from the model , obtained from the appropriate roy dispersion relations for amplitudes of definite isospin projected on these waves and compare them with the polynomial fits provided by bfp  @xcite . projecting on the d- ( f- ) wave , we obtain the corresponding d- ( f- ) wave driving terms : we will merely evaluate these in the threshold region which will yield the driving term contribution to the d- ( f- ) wave scattering lengths .",
    "indeed , it has been noted by bfp that crossing constraints are not guaranteed to be satisfied by this model .",
    "in order to test the reliability of this determination , we then compute the contributions of the medium and high energy information described by the model to three sets of a priori inequivalent sum rules for these scattering lengths that are presently available in direct and indirect forms the literature .",
    "these are obtained from considering ( a ) the froissart - gribov representation for the d- waves in the threshold region  @xcite , ( b ) those derived by wanders  @xcite , and ( c ) those derived from a system of sum rules presented by ananthanarayan , toublan and wanders(atw )  @xcite .",

    "this will be discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the medium and high energy absorptive parts are described by bfp in terms of only one resonance , viz . , the @xmath17 whose mass is taken to be @xmath72 mev and elastic width to be @xmath73 mev .

    "we employ the bfp numbers since these have already gone into the driving terms for the s- and p- waves in the implementation of ref .",
    "while details of the exact implementation are not available , we are faced with the option of representing this resonance in terms of say , a modified breit - wigner propagator along the lines of pennington and protopopescu  @xcite or merely in the narrow width approximation . in practice",
    "we have found that the contributions from the latter when added to the contributions arising from the remainder of the high energy model , yields good agreement with the published polynomial fit of bfp and we have chosen to work with it .",

    "nevertheless , in toto the model yields answers for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that always remain comparable , allowing us to judge the bfp model as being fair in its implementation of crossing symmetry .",
