    "the distribution of the classical satellite galaxies around the milky way is highly anisotropic with most of them being located in a thin plane roughly perpendicular to the disc of the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the clustering of the orbital poles indicates a rotational support of the plane of satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used large - scale cosmological n - body simulations and tried to find similar anisotropic distributions of satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite noted that in all six of their simulations of dark matter haloes the 11 brightest satellites are distributed along thin , disc - like structures and that this distribution reflects the preferential infall of satellites along the spines of a few filaments of the cosmic web .",
    "@xcite found that if selecting the subhaloes expected to be luminous , the distribution of the subhaloes around the three simulated milky way - sized dark matter haloes is consistent with the observed milky way satellites due to the preferential accretion of satellites along filaments and the evolution of satellite orbits within prolate , triaxial potentials .",
    "@xcite simulated 436 haloes and found that the angular momenta of at least three of the eleven brightest satellites point approximately towards the short axis of the satellite distribution in a significant fraction of the haloes .",
    "this result is supported by @xcite , who found that quasi - planar distributions of coherently rotating satellites , such as those inferred in the milky way and other galaxies , arise naturally in simulations of a @xmath1cdm universe . @xcite",
    "examined 1686 milky way - like haloes found in the millennium  ii simulation @xcite and six haloes simulated by the aquarius project @xcite .",
    "they noted that 5 - 10 per cent of the satellite distributions are as flat as the milky way s and that this can be best understood as the consequence of preferential accretion along filaments of the cosmic web and the accretion of a single rich group of satellites .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite argued that cdm simulations do not reproduce the clustering of the orbital poles of the milky way satellites .",
    "the distribution of satellite galaxies around andromeda is also known to be anisotropic @xcite . @xcite and @xcite recently noted the existence of a vast thin plane of dwarf galaxies ( vtpd ) orbiting around the andromeda galaxy .",
    "they analysed 27 satellites examined by the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas , @xcite ) and found that 15 out of the 27 satellites are located in a thin plane with root mean square thickness of @xmath2 kpc .",
    "in addition , 13 of these 15 satellites are supposed to share the same sense of rotation around andromeda @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the existence of this thin plane is highly significant . by assigning a random angular orientation inside the pandas area to each satellite galaxy",
    ", @xcite found that only in 0.13 per cent of all cases a plane as thin as the vtpd is found .",
    "@xcite discussed accretion of satellite galaxies and the in - situ formation as two scenarios to create such a thin plane .",
    "they argue that both do not seem to be able to explain the existence of the vtpd .",
    "a possible clustering of the orbital poles of andromeda s satellites can not be examined since the proper motions of the andromeda satellites are not yet known .",
    "nevertheless a large number of co - rotating satellites located in a thin plane is a remarkable similarity between the andromeda galaxy and the milky way and might point to a similar formation history @xcite .",
    "this idea is backed by the observations of @xcite that the identified plane is approximately aligned with the pole of the milky way s disk and is co - planar to the position vector between the milky way and andromeda . on the other hand",
    "it is of course possible that andromeda and the milky way formed independently and that the alignment is just random .",
    "hence the question remains , whether standard galaxy formation models within the current cosmological framework are sufficient to understand the formation of the andromeda and milky way satellite distributions .",
    "we try to answer this question here for andromeda .",
    "our approach is to search for similar structures in the millennium  ii simulation @xcite , and to examine their formation and evolution .",
    "@xcite scaled the millennium  ii data to match the cosmological parameters derived by wmap7 @xcite and ran a semi - analytic galaxy formation model using the formalism of @xcite over the re - scaled data .",
    "the main difference between the approaches by @xcite and @xcite and the approach used here is the number of examined host haloes .",
    "the millennium  ii simulation provides a large sample of andromeda like host haloes .",
    "this high number makes it possible to quantify the commonness of such structures more effectively .",
    "in addition , we investigate the formation history of some haloes featuring a thin plane . due to the rescaling",
    ", the scaled millennium  ii simulations does not stop at present time .",
    "therefore we are also able to examine the further evolution of thin planes .",
    "the approach presented here can be used to test whether galaxy formation within the @xmath1cdm paradigm is sufficient to explain the formation of such structures .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we discuss our method for selecting andromeda like satallite distributions from the millenium ii simulation . in section 3 , we present the results that we obtained using this method .",
    "we end with a conclusion and discussion of the results in section 4 .",
    "the scaled version of the millennium  ii simulation was created by @xcite using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "this algorithm involves first a reassignment of length , mass and velocity units , followed by a relabelling of the time axis and finally a rescaling of the amplitudes of individual large - scale fluctuation modes .",
    "the re - scaled simulation has a box size of 104.3 mpc / h containing @xmath3 particles with masses of @xmath4/h .",
    "it uses the following cosmological parameters : matter density @xmath5 , baryon density @xmath6 , dark energy density @xmath7 , hubble parameter @xmath8 , scalar spectral index @xmath9 and a fluctuation amplitude at 8 h@xmath10mpc of @xmath11 .",
    "we use the data derived by a semi - analytic galaxy formation model run on the scaled millennium  ii data here .",
    "@xcite used the semi - analytic galaxy formation model developed by @xcite which considers the influence of gas infall ( both cold and hot , primordial and recycled ) , shock heating , cooling , star formation , stellar evolution , supernova feedback , black hole growth , agn feedback , metal enrichment , mergers and tidal and ram - pressure stripping .",
    "the resolution of the millennium ii simulation is high enough to resolve sub - haloes down to masses of @xmath12 @xcite . below this limit ,",
    "individual satellite haloes contain less than 20 particles and are not resolved any more .",
    "guo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) assume that these galaxies are still bound and determine the position of these so - called orphan galaxies by tracking the most bound particle before the disruption of the subhalo .",
    "the validity of this model can be questioned , in particular it is likely that at least some of the orphan galaxies are tidally disrupted .",
    "the positions and velocities of the orphan galaxies might also not be accurate .",
    "simulations with higher resolution would be necessary to solve this problem as indicated by @xcite , however there are indications that the approach by guo et al . still gives reliable results down to lower halo masses .",
    "for example @xcite compared the radial distributions of satellite systems in the millennium ii simulation with those in the aquarius simulation @xcite and the radial distribution of the classical milky way satellites .",
    "they found that the radial distribution predicted by the millennium ii simulation is in good agreement with the higher resolution aquarius simulations as well as with the observations as long as orphan galaxies are included in the analysis .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the stellar mass and luminosity functions predicted by their semi - analytic galaxy formation model match observations well if orphan galaxies are included . in case of the milky way for example they found that the total number of galaxies brighter than m@xmath13 agrees well with the number of milky way satellites brighter than this magnitude limit as predicted by @xcite .    in a first step ,",
    "we query possible host haloes from the millennium  ii database .",
    "the observed virial mass of andromeda is @xmath14 @xcite , therefore we select all haloes from millennium  ii with a virial mass between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we exclude haloes whose mass weighted age according to the semi - analytic calculations of @xcite is higher than 10 gyr , since the average stellar age of stars in the disc of andromeda is supposed to be less than 10 gyr @xcite .",
    "we reject any host halo which has a satellite galaxy with a baryonic mass higher than @xmath17 within a spatial distance of 500  kpc , because such galaxies are not found near andromeda and might disturb the distribution of dwarf galaxies around the host halo .",
    "1825 haloes fulfil these requirements and are regarded as host haloes . for our analysis , we retrieve all relevant parameters ( virial and baryonic masses , positions , velocities ) of dwarf galaxies around each host halo .",
    "these dwarf galaxies are used to search for planes of satellite galaxies .",
    "faint dwarf galaxies are hard to detect .",
    "dwarf galaxies in the pandas field have baryonic masses down to about @xmath18 @xcite . to take care of this mass limit in our analysis we remove all dwarf galaxies with a baryonic mass less than @xmath19 from the data .",
    "@xcite only considered satellites within the pandas area @xcite . due to the luminous disk of andromeda they discarded satellites within a projected distance of 32 kpc as well .",
    "we approximate the pandas area as a sphere with a radius of 128 kpc . since there is no particular line of sight from which satellite galaxies are seen in the millennium  ii simulation ,",
    "we choose one randomly .",
    "we assign an approximated pandas area to each line of sight and exclude all satellites outside this area .",
    "we also discard all satellites within a projected distance of 32 kpc to take obscuration due to a luminous disk into account . for haloes where too many satellites are excluded ,",
    "we choose a new line of sight three times until a sufficient number of satellite galaxies is found . if after three tries we still can not find enough satellite galaxies , we discard the whole halo .",
    "we end up with a list of satellite galaxies with baryonic masses greater than @xmath19 which are located in a pandas like area for each host halo having an average virial mass of @xmath20 .",
    "we find that haloes in the millennium  ii simulation have on average 48 subhaloes fulfilling the requirements described above in a pandas like field . in order to compare the distribution of millennium  ii halos with the andromeda satellite system",
    ", we follow two different approaches . the first is based on the assumption that the pandas is not complete .",
    "this is not an unreasonable assumption , as indicated by the large number of new satellites that were discovered by pandas itself .",
    "most of the remaining satellites ( if any ) are probably close to the faint end of pandas . in order to perform a comparable analysis to that of @xcite",
    ", we select the 27 satellites with the highest baryonic mass for each millennium  ii halo to end up with the same absolute number of satellites as @xcite . of these 27 satellites with the highest baryonic mass on average",
    "67 per cent are orphan galaxies .",
    "the second approach is based on the assumption that pandas is ( nearly ) complete and that andromeda is a halo with a lower than average number of satellite haloes . in this case , we select only those millennium  ii haloes with exactly 27 subhaloes fulfilling the requirements described above ( @xmath21 per cent of all haloes ) . in this case on average 70 per cent of the satellites",
    "are orphan galaxies .    in order to see how this high fraction of orphan galaxies affect the results ,",
    "we perform an additional analysis in which all orphan galaxies are excluded applying the first approach . in this case",
    "the average number of satellites is 12 and only 6 per cent of all haloes have 27 or more satellites and can be compared with andromeda .",
    "@xcite searched for the plane which minimizes the root mean square distance @xmath22 of the satellite galaxies perpendicular to this plane . for the calculation of @xmath22 they only considered those 15 satellite galaxies which are closest to the plane .",
    "they mentioned that the number 15 was chosen only because the plane thickness increases significantly if a larger number of satellites is chosen .",
    "when measuring the plane thickness , @xcite took distance errors to individual galaxies into account .",
    "they calculated a @xmath22 value of @xmath23  kpc for the andromeda satellite distribution and we use this value as the @xmath22 value of andromeda in this paper .",
    "we also use the 15 nearest satellites for the calculation of the best fitting plane for the millennium  ii haloes to ensure comparability .",
    "we characterize the satellite distribution around each halo by two different numbers .",
    "first , we calculate the root mean square distance @xmath22 of the satellites to the best fitting plane using the method of @xcite descriped above .",
    "second , we calculate the root mean square distance @xmath24 of the satellites projected in the plane to the center of the host halo . for the calculation of both @xmath22 and @xmath24 , we use only the 15 satellites which are closest to the best fitting plane .",
    "it is important to compare the radial concentration of the satellite distributions of the millennium  ii haloes and the satellite distribution around andromeda since it is of course more likely to find planes with low values of @xmath22 in more radially concentrated galaxy distributions .",
    "we use @xmath24 to measure the radial concentration .",
    "the @xmath24 value of the andromeda satellite distribution turns out to be 167.5 kpc .",
    "we furthermore calculate the sense of rotation of each satellite galaxy belonging to the best fitting plane .",
    "we calculate the sense of rotation of each satellite galaxy relative to the best fitting plane and determine the number of co - rotating and counter - rotating galaxies . the number of co - rotating galaxies is then given by the maximum of the two numbers .",
    "all the methods described above only use data from the snapshot closest to the present age of the universe . to learn about the time evolution of thin planes",
    ", we consider all haloes with an @xmath22 value lower than 14 kpc and with 13 or more co - rotating satellites and trace back the 15 satellites closest to the corresponding best fitting plane of these haloes to @xmath25 corresponding to a time @xmath26 gyr before present time ( @xmath27 gyr ) by querying their first progenitors and calculating the value of @xmath22 at every snapshot .",
    "the first progenitor is the most massive progenitor of the satellite in the majority of cases .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for a detailed description of the algorithm choosing the first progenitor .",
    "if a first progenitor does not exist for a satellite , we reduce the number of satellites considered in the calculation of @xmath22 to the remaining number of satellites .",
    "a reduction of the number of considered satellites alleviates finding a good fitting plane to the remaining ones . in consequence",
    "lower @xmath22 values are more likely .",
    "in addition , we follow the further evolution of the 15 satellites by pursuing their descendants until @xmath28 and calculating the value of @xmath22 at every snapshot .",
    "this is possible because the scaled version of the millennium  ii simulation does not stop at @xmath29 but at @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath30 gyr . due to mergers and the fact that not all haloes can be resolved in all snapshots , the number of satellites can also decrease if following the further evolution . in this case",

    "we also find that this good agreement is partially due to a mismatch of the radial distributions between the millennium  ii haloes and the satellite system of andromeda , since the millennium  ii satellites tend to be more radially concentrated than andromeda s satellites .",

    "<S> this demonstrates that the vtpd is not in conflict with the standard cosmological framework , although a definite answer of this question might require higher resolution cosmological simulations that do not have to consider orphan galaxies . </S>",
