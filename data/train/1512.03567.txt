    "oscillating systems subject to pulsed inputs or interactions were studied in many different areas , such as dynamics of spiking neurons @xcite , communication of fireflies by short light pulses @xcite , impacting mechanical oscillators @xcite , electronic oscillators @xcite , optical systems @xcite , stimulation of cardiac @xcite , respiratory @xcite or circadian @xcite rhythms .",
    "simple but powerful models to describe such systems are phase oscillators with pulsatile coupling , which are especially popular in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "apart of the simplicity of phase models in comparison to conductance - based models @xcite , they possess two main features : the possibility of individual neurons to produce periodic output , and the fact that interaction between neurons is mediated by the brief action potentials or spikes , which have a temporal duration much smaller than the interspike intervals ( isis ) .",
    "moreover , the effect of a spike depends on the dynamical state at which the neuron is located at the time of the spike arrival . in phase models",
    "such an effect is incorporated with the help of phase reset curves ( prc ) @xcite . in its representation as a phase oscillator , each type of neuron possesses a characteristic prc corresponding to a particular stimulus .",
    "hence , parameter changes in the neuron or the stimulus are reflected by changes in the shape of the prc .",
    "prcs can be computed for any oscillatory system and stimulus including neuronal models such as hodgkin - huxley , fitzhugh - nagumo , and others @xcite . in this way ,",
    "pulse - coupled systems can be considered either as stand - alone models , or as approximations of coupled oscillatory conductance - based systems . among the advantages of such models",
    "is their simple numerical implementation , their lower dimension in comparison with conductance - based models , as well as the possibility to adjust the prc numerically and measure it experimentally @xcite .",
    "the phase description can serve as an appropriate approximation , if the responses of the system to inputs introduce transient deviations from the oscillatory state , which are shorter than the isis .",
    "in this paper we consider a single oscillator with pulsatile delayed feedback extending the results reported in @xcite .",
    "the study on this basic and very common `` motif '' @xcite is important for understanding the behavior of larger delay - coupled networks @xcite .",
    "for instance , a loop consisting of one excitatory and one inhibitory neuron with delayed connection shows similar behavior to a neuron with delayed self - feedback @xcite , and also the behavior of rings of several neurons are , in some cases , related to the behavior of a single neuron with delayed feedback @xcite .",
    "in fact , a larger neuronal feedback delay might firstly arise due to a chained propagation of action potentials along a ring of neurons .",
    "another motivation to study a single oscillator with delayed feedback arises from the study of ensembles of delay coupled oscillators where the synchronous regime and some modes of its instability can be described by the behavior of a single oscillator @xcite .",
    "although we approach the problem of an oscillator with pulsed feedback from a general perspective , not bound to a specific area of application , neurons with delayed feedback are a prototypical example for such systems . there exist some studies on this subject @xcite , all of which have a common baseline : delay leads to immense multistability . at first glance",
    "this result is not too surprising since multistability generically arises in delay differential equations due to a well - known mechanism called `` periodic solution reappearance '' @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the case of a pulsatile feedback , this mechanism does not always explain the large variety of observed solutions .",
    "another property , which is connected to some combinatorial relations between the isis is responsible for the extreme multistability which arises for larger values of the feedback delay .",
    "for example , ma and wu @xcite found for several neuron models that a large number of periodic solutions coexists . remarkably , these solutions exhibit only a few distinct isis ; moreover , different solutions can be transformed into another by permuting the order of the isis .",
    "our results shed some light on these earlier works from another perspective .",
    "we show that an oscillatory system with delayed pulsatile feedback may generically exhibit a very surprising phenomenon , which manifests itself as follows : under some conditions a periodical regime of regular spiking destabilizes in a degenerate manner such that several multipliers ( lyapunov exponents ) become critical at once .",
    "the number of the critical multipliers is proportional to the feedback delay and can be arbitrary large .",
    "thus , the dimension of the unstable manifold of the regular spiking solution changes abruptly from zero to an arbitrary large value , which we call the `` dimension explosion '' phenomenon . as a result of such a bifurcation ,",
    "we show that there appear multiple coexistent periodic solutions with larger periods , characterized by distinct isis .",
    "we call such regimes with non - equal isis `` jittering '' regimes , by analogy with well - known timing jitter in optical and electronic systems @xcite .",
    "previously , the solutions with non - equal isis have been reported in various oscillator models subject to delayed feedback @xcite . in our model ,",
    "remarkably , the numerous jittering regimes emerge at once at the bifurcation point which leads us to adopt the name `` multi - jitter '' bifurcation .",
    "we prove that the number of the emergent jittering solutions grows exponentially with the delay .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model for a phase oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback , introduce some definitions and assumptions , and give the system s reformulation as discrete return map of isi - sequences . in section  [ sec : regular - spiking ]",
    "we study the regime of regular spiking ( rs ) where all isis are identical .",
    "we obtain an explicit parametric expression for all branches of rs solutions , determine their stability , and give conditions for the multi - jitter bifurcation .",
    "it turns out that the crucial quantity involved is the steepness of the prc . in the following section  [ sec : numerical ]",
    "we undertake a numerical exploration of the system s behavior beyond the multi - jitter bifurcation and report a huge multistability of periodic solutions and chaotic attractors .",
    "the most dominant type of the observed solutions exhibits a periodic repetition of only two different isis in seemingly arbitrary order .",
    "we explain this phenomenon in section  [ sec : solution_explosion ] where we prove that the phenomenon of dimension explosion is indeed accompanied by an explosion of the number of coexisting solutions . in section  [ sec : experimental - observation - of ] we present an experimental realization , where the effects predicted by the phase model can be observed in an electronic oscillator .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider an oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback of the form @xcite : @xmath0 the oscillator is described by its phase @xmath1 , which changes on the circle @xmath2 $ ] with @xmath3 and @xmath4 identified . in the case without delayed feedback , the phase grows uniformly with normalized frequency @xmath5 .",
    "when the phase reaches unity , the oscillator is assumed to emit a pulse .",
    "the instants when the pulses are emitted are denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 . the emitted pulses",
    "propagate along the feedback line and affect the oscillator after the delay @xmath8 at the time instants @xmath9 .",
    "when a pulse is received , the phase of the oscillator undergoes an instantaneous , discontinuous shift , and changes its value to the new value @xmath10 where @xmath11 and the function @xmath12 is the prc @xcite . in the following , we suppose that @xmath12 is continuous and differentiable for all @xmath1 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath13 which means that the oscillator does not respond to perturbations during its own spike . in some cases ,",
    "such an assumption is reasonable , especially for the modeling of neuronal dynamics involving a fast change in the systems state around @xmath3 , see additional discussion in @xcite .",

    "stars indicate points , where @xmath21 corresponding to possible multi - jitter bifurcations [ see sec .  [ sec : linear - stability ] ] . ]",
    "we define the steepness as the maximal _ downward _ slope of @xmath22 : @xmath23 we emphasize , that the amplitude of the prc and many features of its shape ( e.g. , whether it is of type i or ii , unimodal , etc . )",
    "are not crucial for our results and the reported phenomena can be observed for any prc possessing a sufficiently high steepness . for the function ( [ eq : prc ] )",
    "the steepness can be estimated for large @xmath20 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is euler s number [ see appendix  [ sec : appendix - steepness ] ] .",
    "as for any system with time delay , some amount of information about its past is required for system ( [ eq:1 ] ) in order to determine its future evolution .",
    "however , because of the pulsatile nature of the feedback , the only information needed is the time - moments of the pulses @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "in @xcite it was proven that a system with pulsatile delayed coupling can be reduced to a finite - dimensional map under quite general conditions . for the oscillator ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "such a map can be obtained for the isis @xmath26 : @xmath27 the map ( [ eq : map - definition ] ) determines the next isi based on the @xmath28 preceding isis .",
    "equation ( [ eq : map - definition ] ) can equivalently be written as the @xmath28-dimensional map @xmath29 according to@xcite , the map dimension is bounded as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 for the prc ( [ eq : prc ] ) , @xmath32 .",
    "the map ( [ eq : map - definition ] ) can have different and complicated forms depending on the relation between the delay time and the spiking frequency @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will not write down the general form of @xmath33 here .",
    "instead , we derive the form of the map for the case when there is only one feedback spike arriving at the oscillator during each isi .",
    "this form is adequate in many cases , and in particular for rs regimes , which are fixed points of ( [ eq : map - definition ] ) , and are characterized by a repeated spiking with a constant isi length @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",

    "the phase value @xmath42 $ ] at the moment of the pulse arrival equals @xmath43 hence the corresponding shift of the perturbed phase equals @xmath44 and the oscillator s phase immediately after the pulse impact is @xmath45 . finally , the isi @xmath46 is determined from the condition @xmath47 : @xmath48 hence , for ( [ eq : map - definition ] ) we obtain the form @xmath49      in the case of rs the oscillator emits pulses periodically with @xmath50 and @xmath51 for all @xmath35 .",

    "we have considered values of the delay within the range @xmath224 $ ] which corresponds to @xmath225 . according to the estimate ( [ eq : sol_number ] ) at least 18 different jittering regimes should exist for the considered values of @xmath8 .",
    "each of this regimes can be encoded by a binary sequence of length @xmath226 representing a short isi by zero and a long by one .",
    "not all of these regimes are distinguishable in the bifurcation diagram since some of them are constituted of the same isis and thus correspond to the same points . to detect experimentally the coexistence of such solutions we temporarily applied an external noisy signal to induce switches between different attractors .",
    "an example of a jittering regime observed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](d ) .",
    "the solution consists of a periodic repetition of four short and three long isis . in the phase - plane projection of the system",

    ". moreover , the delay intervals in which such branches are observed coincide as well .",
    "this suggests that , also for the experimental system , the stability of a bipartite regime does only depend on the number of short and long isis , not on their order .",
    "in a phase oscillator with pulsatile feedback ( [ eq:1 ] ) the destabilization of the regular spiking mode can occur through a peculiar bifurcation in which the dimension of the unstable manifold `` explodes '' , i.e. changes abruptly from zero to an arbitrary large value . to our opinion , it is remarkable and surprising that the single ( and robust ) condition @xmath227 induces a destabilization of the regular spiking regime along many directions simultaneously .",
    "normally , bifurcations in which many multipliers become critical simultaneously have large codimension .",
    "this means that they take place in low - dimensional subsets of a high - dimensional parameter space . in this sense , the multi - jitter bifurcation in system ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "has codimension one , since it occurs when a scalar equation of the system parameters is fulfilled , namely @xmath228 .",
    "varying a single system parameter , e.g. the delay , one can trigger this bifurcation .",
    "thus , it is a degenerate bifurcation which emerges generically .",
    "this paradox originates in the structure of the map ( [ eq : t - oiou ] ) considered as a @xmath229dimensional map @xmath230 where @xmath231 . besides the calculation of the new isi @xmath232 the map only shifts the past isis by one component , which corresponds to the introduction of a comoving timeframe",
    "this results in a specific structure of the map jacobian @xmath233,\\label{eq : jacobian}\\ ] ] where @xmath234 .",
    "the matrix @xmath235 is the companion matrix of the characteristic equation ( [ eq_char ] ) .",
    "although one may think of arbitrary perturbations of the map ( [ eq : p - dim - map ] ) only few of them are physically meaningful .",
    "for example , if we introduce an additional parameter @xmath236 to alter the first equation of the map such that @xmath237 with some function @xmath238 , this would not correspond to a reasonable perturbation because intervals of time do not become longer or shorter while the origin of time is shifted by a comoving timeframe .",
    "similar reasoning reveals that the structure of the whole map should be preserved .",
    "it seems that physically admissible perturbations can only affect the delay @xmath8 or the prc shape and all these perturbations exclusively affect the coefficient @xmath88 in the jacobian ( [ eq : jacobian ] ) while its structure preserves .",
    "thus , the characteristic equation remains of the form ( [ eq_char ] ) which implies a multi - jitter bifurcation for @xmath79 , where many multipliers become unstable at once .    besides the discovery of the dimension explosion phenomenon , which is surprising _ per se _ , we proved that each such bifurcation is accompanied by a potentially huge number of simultaneously emerging jittering solutions .",
    "this observation lead us to adopt the name `` multi - jitter '' bifurcation .",
    "more precisely , the number of the emergent coexisting solutions is exponential in the length of the delay @xmath8 .",
    "this phenomenon is akin to the reappearance of periodic solutions , a well - known property of delay differential equations @xcite .",
    "consider a @xmath53-periodic solution @xmath239 of the general equation @xmath240 then it is clear from the periodicity of the solution @xmath241 that it also solves the equation @xmath242 for any @xmath112 .",
    "it means , that the same periodic solution reappears at the delay times @xmath243 .",
    "note that the stability of the reappearing solution can be different for different delay times ( see more details in @xcite ) .",
    "the number of coexisting reappearant solutions increases linearly with the delay time , which can be accessed intuitively from the observation that the reappearing branch of solutions is stretched proportionally to the reappearance index @xmath28 and the change in period along the branch [ cf .",
    "the branch of rs solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig : b1d_q5 ] ] .",
    "in contrast to this type of reappearance , the reappearant solutions in system ( [ eq:1 ] ) may not be identical to the original solution , but the possibility of isi reordering allows for the emergence of a multitude of new solutions .",
    "thus , we observe reappearance not of whole solutions , but of individual isis , which leads us to propose to call the phenomenon `` quasi - reappearance '' .",
    "for instance , the existence of a period-2 solution with the isis @xmath173 and @xmath174 implies the existence of infinitely many bipartite solutions which exhibit exactly these isis for larger delays .",
    "in fact , _ every _ periodical sequence of these two isis will correspond to a solution of ( [ eq:1 ] ) for an appropriate value of the delay . indeed , if the sequence @xmath244 solves ( [ eq : t - oiou ] ) for some @xmath245 , and arbitrary periodical sequence of the two isis containing @xmath188 instances of @xmath173 and @xmath189 instances of @xmath174 per period solves ( [ eq : t - oiou ] ) for @xmath246 the combinatorial variety of the quasi - reappearant solutions causes an exponential increase of their number with the delay .",
    "therefore the multistability of the system increases potentially much faster than due to ordinary reappearance .",
    "an interesting property following from this mechanism of quasi - reappearance is that the @xmath8-intervals for the existence of the jittering regimes at a certain @xmath28 are ordered according to the corresponding number of short / long isis [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](c ) ] . the regime with just _ one _ long",
    "isi is stable for the smallest values of @xmath8 in the region corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "subsequently , the three regimes with _ two _ long isis stabilize for larger @xmath8 , then the regimes with _ three _ long isis stabilize and so on . it is also noteworthy that the intervals of stability of the regimes with @xmath188 and @xmath247 long isis may overlap giving rise to even greater multistability .",
    "this feature is also confirmed by the experiment : for example , for @xmath248ms , ten different jittering regimes are observed [ cf .",
    "[ fig : exp](c ) ] .",
    "we would also like to comment on the relevance of the multi - jittering phenomenon to more realistic setups , where the oscillator s phase space has a higher dimension than one and the pulse is smooth and of finite duration .",
    "we have demonstrated that the multi - jitter instability can appear in real electronic circuit as well as in a simulated hodgkin - huxley neuron model @xcite and it might be one of the mechanisms behind the appearance of irregular spiking in neuronal models with delayed feedback @xcite and timing jitter in semiconductor laser systems with delayed feedback @xcite reported by other authors .",
    "our theory predicts and our numerical simulations confirm that the essential property for the occurrence of a dimension explosion bifurcation is the steepness of the prc corresponding to the pulsatile feedback action .",
    "the presence of regions where the slope of the prc fulfills @xmath227 requires some specific organization of the oscillator s phase space .",
    "consider the phase transition map    @xmath249    which describes change of the oscillator s phase under the action of the feedback pulse .",
    "notice that @xmath227 for some @xmath1 if and only if the phase transition map is non - monotonous .",
    "this means that the input can inverse the phase order of some points from the limit cycle , such that @xmath250 for some @xmath251 .",
    "this feature can be interpreted geometrically as a property of the isochrons in the oscillator s phase space .",
    "the isochrons are sets consisting of points that have the same phase , i.e. , their distance vanishes for @xmath252 as they are attracted to the limit cycle @xcite .",
    "the new phase @xmath253 induced by a pulse , which starts when the oscillator is located at phase @xmath1 on the limit cycle , is determined by the isochron to which the point with the phase @xmath1 is conveyed by the pulse .",
    "the fact that the input inverses the phase order of some neighboring points from the limit cycle implies that the point of smaller phase transverses more isochrons than the other .",
    "if the direction of the pulse does not change , which typically leads to a straight displacement of the oscillator s state @xcite , the isochrons should have a specific form of nested u - shaped curves .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : isochrons-1 ] for the fitzhugh - nagumo system .",
    "( color online ) the isochrons ( thin red lines ) of the limit cycle ( thick black ) of a fitzhugh - nagumo model show the structure necessary for @xmath227 .",
    "the phase order of two different points on the limit cycle , @xmath254 and @xmath255 , is reversed by the corresponding pulse .",
    "this means they are carried to new points @xmath256 and @xmath257 which lie on isochrons with a reversed phase order . ]",
    "the above reasoning shows that the multi - jitter bifurcation is possible only for oscillators with specific structure of the phase space , namely the limit cycle isochrons .",
    "however , there is a very easy criterion reflecting this structure , which is the presence of regions with slope < -1 in the prc .",
    "prcs possessing this property have been experimentally measured here for the electronic oscillator and by other authors for chemical oscillators @xcite and cardiac cells @xcite . as for neurons , prcs with steep falling parts have been observed @xcite , but there is no data whether their slope can be less than -1 or not .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that prcs of both type i and type ii with slope @xmath258 can be easily obtained for many neural models @xcite .",
    "this fact draws attention to the importance of assessing the slopes of the prcs measured for living neurons .",
    "thus , the discovered dimension explosion and multi - jittering phenomena are relevant not only for a simple phase - reduced model , but for realistic oscillatory systems as well .",
    "a promising application for systems exhibiting high - dimensional complex dynamics is their utilization as liquid state machines . for lasers with long delayed feedback",
    "this has been done successfully @xcite . in view of the arbitrarily high dimensional critical manifolds of the rs solution , which were observed in this paper",
    ", it seems to be worth studying such computational abilities for an oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback .",
    "an electronic implementation of such systems is relatively uncomplicated @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied the dynamics of oscillators with pulsatile delayed self - feedback where we directed our attention to the influence and interplay of the feedback delay and the shape of the oscillator s prc . as a major result",
    "we have proven that , if the oscillator s prc possesses sufficiently steep parts , the system undergoes a sequence of degenerate bifurcations as the feedback delay is increased .",
    "these multi - jitter bifurcations lead to a destabilization of the regular spiking regime through the emergence of an unstable manifold of arbitrarily large dimension , which is proportional to the delay size .",
    "moreover , we proved that each multi - jitter bifurcation is accompanied by emergence of numerous `` jittering '' periodic solutions with distinct isis .",
    "we showed that the mechanism of emergence of such solutions generalizes what is known as reappearance of periodic solutions . in this quasi - reappearance , individual isis of solutions existing for smaller values of the delay reappear .",

    "<S> interaction via pulses is common in many natural systems , especially neuronal . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study one of the simplest possible systems with pulse interaction : a phase oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback . </S>",
    "<S> when the oscillator reaches a specific state , it emits a pulse , which returns after propagating through a delay line . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of an incoming pulse is described by the oscillator s phase reset curve ( prc ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such a system we discover an unexpected phenomenon : for a sufficiently steep slope of the prc , a periodic regular spiking solution bifurcates with several multipliers crossing the unit circle at the same parameter value . </S>",
    "<S> the number of such critical multipliers increases linearly with the delay and thus may be arbitrary large . </S>",
    "<S> this bifurcation is accompanied by the emergence of numerous `` jittering '' regimes with non - equal interspike intervals ( isis ) . </S>",
    "<S> each of these regimes corresponds to a periodic solution of the system with a period roughly proportional to the delay . </S>",
    "<S> the number of different `` jittering '' solutions emerging at the bifurcation point increases exponentially with the delay . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the combinatorial mechanism that underlies the emergence of such a variety of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show how a periodic solution exhibiting several distinct isis can imply the existence of multiple other solutions obtained by rearranging of these isis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the theoretical results for phase oscillators accurately predict the behavior of an experimentally implemented electronic oscillator with pulsatile feedback . </S>"
