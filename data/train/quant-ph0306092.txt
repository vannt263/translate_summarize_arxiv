    "suppose someone claims that the chances of rain in vienna and budapest are 0.1 in each one of the cities alone , and the joint probability of rainfall in both cities is 0.99 .",
    "would such a proposition appear reasonable ?",
    "certainly not , for even intuitively it does not make much sense to claim that it rains almost never in one of the cities , yet almost always in both of them .",
    "the worrying question remains : which numbers could be considered reasonable and consistent ?",
    "surely , the joint probability should not exceed any single probability .",
    "this certainly appears to be a necessary condition , but is it a sufficient one ? in the middle of the 19th century george boole , in response to such queries , formulated a theory of `` conditions of possible experience '' @xcite which dealt with this problem .",
    "boole s requirements on the ( joint ) probabilities of logically connected events are expressed by certain equations or inequalities relating those ( joint ) probabilities .    since bell s investigations @xcite into bounds on classical probabilities , similar inequalities for a particular physical setup",
    "have been discussed in great number and detail . in",
    "what follows , the classical bounds are referred to as `` bell - type inequalities . ''",
    "whereas these bounds are interesting if one wants to inspect the violations of classical probabilities by quantum probabilities , the validity of quantum probabilities and their experimental verification is a completely different issue .",
    "here we shall present detailed numerical studies on the bounds of quantum probabilities which , in analogy to the classical bounds , are experimentally testable .      in order to establish bounds on quantum probabilities ,",
    "let us recall that pitowsky has given a geometrical interpretation of the bounds of classical probabilities in terms of correlation polytopes @xcite [ see also froissart @xcite and tsirelson ( also spelled cirelson ) @xcite ] .",
    "consider an arbitrary number of classical events @xmath0 .",
    "take some ( or all of ) their probabilities and some ( or all of ) the joint probabilities @xmath1 and identify them with the components of a vector @xmath2 formed in euclidean space .",
    "since the probabilities @xmath3 , @xmath4 are assumed to be independent , every single one of their extreme cases @xmath5 is feasible .",
    "the combined values of @xmath6 of the extreme cases @xmath7 , together with the joined probabilities @xmath8 can also be interpreted as rows of a truth table ; with @xmath5 corresponding to `` _ false _ '' and `` _ true , _ '' respectively . moreover",
    ", any such entry corresponds to a _ two - valued measure _",
    "( also called _ valuation , 0 - 1-measure _ or _ dispersionless measure _ ) .    in geometrical terms",
    ", any classical probability distribution is representable by some convex sum over all two - valued measures characterized by the row entries of the truth tables .",
    "that is , it corresponds to some point on the face of the classical correlation polytope @xmath9 which is defined by the set of all points whose convex sum extends over all vectors associated with row entries in the truth table @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , consider the convex hull @xmath11 of the set @xmath12 here , the terms @xmath13 stand for arbitrary products associated with the joint propositions which are considered .",
    "exactly what terms are considered depends on the particular physical configuration .    by the minkoswki - weyl representation theorem @xcite",
    ", every convex polytope has a dual ( equivalent ) description : ( i ) either as the convex hull of its extreme points ; i.e. , vertices ; ( ii ) or as the intersection of a finite number of half - spaces , each one given by a linear inequality . the linear inequalities , which are obtained from the set @xmath10 of vertices by solving the so called _ hull problem _ coincide with boole s `` conditions of possible experience . ''    for particular physical setups ,",
    "the inequalities can be identified with bell - type inequalities which have to be satisfied by all classical probability distributions .",
    "these conditions are demarcation criteria ; i.e. , they are complete and maximal in the sense that no other system of inequality exist which characterizes the correlation polytopes completely and exhaustively ( that is , the bounds on probabilities can not be enlarged and improved ) .",
    "generalizations to the joint distributions of more than two particles are straightforward .",
    "correlation polytopes have provided a systematic , constructive way of finding the entire set of bell - type inequalities associated with any particular physical configuration @xcite , although from a computational complexity point of view @xcite , the problem remains intractable @xcite .      just as the bell - type inequalities represent bounds on the classical probabilities or expectation values , there exist bounds on quantum probabilities . in what follows",
    "we shall concentrate on these quantum plausibility criteria , in particular on the bounds characterizing the demarcation line for quantum probabilities .",
    "although being less restrictive than the classical probabilities , quantum probabilities do not violate the bell - type inequalities maximally @xcite .",
    "tsirelson @xcite as well as pitowsky @xcite have investigated the analytic aspect of bounds on quantum correlations .",
    "analytic bounds can also be obtained _ via _ the _ minmax principle _",
    "@xcite , stating that the the bound ( or norm ) of a self - adjoint operator is equal to the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvectors correspond to pure states associated with these eigenvalues .",
    "thus , the minmax principle is for the quantum correlation functions what the minkoswki - weyl representation theorem is for the classical correlations .",
    "werner and wolf @xcite , as well as cabello @xcite , have considered maximal violations of correlation inequalities , and have also enumerated quantum states associated with extreme points of the convex set of quantum correlation functions .",
    "the maximal violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality involving expectation values of binary observables is related to grothendieck s constant @xcite .",
    "but the demarcation criteria for quantum probabilities are still far less understood than their classical counterparts . in a broader context",
    ", cabello has described a violation of the chsh inequality beyond the quantum mechanical ( tsirelson s ) bound by applying selection schemes to particles in a ghz - state @xcite , yet here we only deal with the usual quantum probabilities of events which are not subject to selection procedures .    to be more precise ,",

    "a proof of the convexity of @xmath29 can be found in @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that geometrical objects derived from expectation values need not be , and in fact are not convex , as an example below shows .",
    "one could obtain an intuitive picture of @xmath29 by imagining it as an object ( in high dimensions ) created from `` soap surfaces '' which is suspended on the edges of @xmath22 , and which is blown up with air : the original polytope faces which are hyperplanes get `` bulged '' or `` curved out '' such that , instead of a single plane per face , a continuity of tangent hyperplanes are necessary to characterize it @xcite .",
