    "while the structure of qcd at finite temperature has been investigated in detail using lattice qcd , little is known about matter at finite baryon density due to the sign problem @xcite . in order to avoid this difficulty one can consider 2color qcd @xcite , imaginary chemical potential simulations @xcite , the response of a hadron mass to changes in the chemical potential , @xmath0 and @xmath7 , at zero chemical potential ( @xmath2=0 ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "since the direct application of qcd at finite temperature and chemical potential is not available in the present lattice qcd simulations , effective models of qcd are commonly used .",
    "one of the most popular models is the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "this model has been widely used for describing hadron properties in hot and/or dense matter @xcite .    in this work we present njl model calculations of @xmath0 for the pion and kaon .",
    "the primary goal of our study is to get the same quantity which is simulated on the lattice , i.e. , @xmath0(@xmath1 , @xmath2=0 ) .",
    "of course , the direct comparison between the lattice data and the present njl model calculations is rather difficult because @xmath0 on the lattice means the variation of a screening mass , while it corresponds to the variation of a dynamical mass in the present work .",
    "nevertheless , we can compare both results to each other qualitatively .",
    "in contrast to the lattice simulations , we also get @xmath0 at finite chemical potential within this model",
    ". then , this may give information on the role of the light quark ( the @xmath4 and @xmath6 quarks ) chemical potential and/or the strange quark chemical potential in hot and/or dense matter .",
    "in addition , we consider two cases for the pion .",
    "one is the pion with the same @xmath4 , @xmath6 quark mass .",
    "the other is the pion with non - degenerate @xmath4 and @xmath6 quark masses . since the present lattice qcd can not simulate the characteristics coming from slightly different @xmath4 and @xmath6 quark masses @xcite",
    ", the response of the pion mass with different @xmath4 and @xmath6 quark masses can be useful for future studies of @xmath0 on the lattice .    due to the limitation of space we present only the results with a non - zero vector ",
    "axial vector coupling @xmath3 in this paper",
    ". please refer to @xcite for basic formulae to get @xmath0 for the kaon and pion in the njl model and the results without @xmath3 .",
    "detailed derivations including small corrections in the figures in @xcite will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one of njl model calculations showed that the @xmath8 mass at finite density with @xmath90 is quite different from that with @xmath3=0 @xcite . in this section , we show the chemical potential response of the kaon mass by including a non - zero @xmath3 . in the case of the pion , the effect of the non - zero vector ",
    "axial vector coupling is negligible @xcite .",
    "we follow the formalism and the same parameters in @xcite . first , in fig .",
    "[ dqc - gv ] let us show the responses of quark condensates with ( and also without ) @xmath3 at @xmath10=0.02 , 0.04 gev , respectively .",
    "the effect of a non - zero @xmath3 on the @xmath5 quark condensate is much larger than that on the @xmath4 quark condensate .",
    "this behavior can be understood from a large difference in the @xmath5 quark mass , i.e. , @xmath11=135.7 mev in @xcite and @xmath11=88.0 mev in the present work .",
    "since the response of the @xmath5 quark condensate becomes much larger than before , one can expect that @xmath12 for the kaon will be quite different from the previous values .    in fig .",
    "[ isos - k - gv ] , we show @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath8 . for comparison",
    "we also show the previous results without @xmath3 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath13 at each point is rather meaningless because all the parameters including the quark masses are changed .",
    "we would like to show only a qualitative behavior of @xmath13 in this figure .",
    "the mass of @xmath14 is slightly affected by the vector - axial vector interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath13 for @xmath8 is much different from the previous one , where @xmath3=0 .",
    "this result confirms the previous njl model calculations that the vector ",
    "axial vector interaction reduces the effects of the fermi sea and the @xmath8 mass is a smoothly decreasing function of density @xcite .",
    "using the njl model we have calculated the chemical potential responses of the kaon and pion masses , @xmath12 and @xmath15 , at zero and finite chemical potential , and found that their behaviors are quite different from each other .",
    "our results show that @xmath0 is much dependent on the mass difference of two quarks , i.e. , the mass difference between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks , or even between the @xmath4 and @xmath6 quarks .",
    "even at very small chemical potentials @xmath12 is much different from @xmath15 .",
    "let us discuss some uncertainties in our calculations .",
    "first , the mass in our formalism means the dynamical mass , while the screening mass is simulated on the lattice . for the direct comparison we may need the formalism to calculate the screening mass in the njl model as given in @xcite",
    "this may help us to properly interpret the lattice data .",
    "second , while the lattice simulations of @xmath0 show a large difference between in the confinement phase and in the deconfinement phase @xcite , we can not predict @xmath0 above the mott temperature in the present work .",
    "this is because we have excluded the imaginary part of the 1loop polarization function in the dispersion relation and considered only the region below the mott temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , the imaginary part of the polarization function should be included for a detailed analysis above the mott temperature .    as a final remark",
    ", we confirm that @xmath16 is negative within the present njl model approach , and find a clear quark mass dependence between @xmath17 and @xmath18 both below and above the mott temperature @xcite .",
    "the second order response of the quark condensate @xmath19 at @xmath2=0 can also be simulated on the lattice @xcite , and its behavior is similar to the result from the present njl model calculation .",
