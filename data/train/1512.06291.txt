    "a model of wiretap channel was first studied by wyner @xcite , where a source wishes to send its message to a legitimate destination while keeping it secret from an eavesdropper .",
    "wyner established the secrecy capacity for the degraded case where the eavesdropper receives a physically degraded version of the channel output at the legitimate destination .",
    "csiszr and krner generalized his work to general , not necessarily degraded , discrete memoryless wiretap channel @xcite .",
    "this line of work has been subsequently extended to various multi - user scenarios , see e.g. , @xcite , however , the characterization of the secrecy capacity remains a challenging open problem in general .",
    "in fact , even for the seemingly simple case of the gaussian multiple access - wiretap channel , the secrecy capacity is only known for the degraded case  @xcite .    recently , as an alternative but insightful measure , the secure degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) has been actively studied @xcite for various multi - user wiretap networks . for the gaussian multiple access - wiretap channel , the sum secure d.o.f . was shown to be @xmath0 for almost all channel gains @xcite .",
    "for achievability , a cooperative jamming scheme was proposed that incorporates real interference alignment @xcite at the legitimate destination and the eavesdropper . in many practical scenarios , however , it is hard for the source and the legitimate destination to know the eavesdropper s channel state information ( csi ) . in @xcite , the secure d.o.f . with no eavesdropper s csi",
    "was characterized for some interesting one - hop wiretap channels . for the gaussian multiple access - wiretap channel , the sum secure d.o.f . was shown in @xcite to reduce to @xmath1 with no eavesdropper s csit , which is achieved by a blind cooperative jamming scheme .",
    "we note that the prior work has focused on one - hop wiretap networks , and to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior work on the secure d.o.f . for multi - hop wiretap networks .    in this paper , we consider the gaussian diamond - wiretap channel illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] that consists of an orthogonal broadcast channel from a source to two relays and a gaussian multiple access - wiretap channel from the two relays to a legitimate destination and an eavesdropper .",
    "we consider both the case where the relays and the legitimate destination know the legitimate csi and the eavesdropper s csi and the case where they know only the legitimate csi , which we call the case with full csi and the case with no eavesdropper s csi , respectively .",
    "the proposed setting is a two - hop communication network and involves several new elements not present in the single - hop networks studied previously .",
    "our model introduces a new possibility of utilizing common message and/or common noise for the gaussian multiple access - wiretap channel .",
    "this brings in an interesting tension in the use of the broadcast links regarding whether we send independent messages , common message , common noise , or a function of those across the broadcast part . at one extreme , when the capacities of the orthogonal links in the broadcast part are sufficiently small , the optimal strategy turns out to send independent partial message to each relay and incorporate jamming schemes @xcite for the multiple access part . at the other extreme ,",
    "when the broadcast part has sufficiently high capacity to transmit common message or common noise symbols to the relays , without incurring bottleneck , it follows that the secure d.o.f . equals @xmath2 using the results @xcite for the multiple - input single - output ( miso ) wiretap channel .",
    "when the link capacities of the broadcast part are moderate , however , the optimal scheme is not immediate .",
    "furthermore , due to the possibility of sending common information across the broadcast part , we can not assume in proving converse that the channel inputs and outputs at the relays are independent , whereas channel inputs at transmitters are inherently independent in most one - hop wiretap networks .",
    "+    on the other hand , with no secrecy constraint , our model falls back to the diamond channel introduced by schein @xcite , whose capacity is not known in general . for a range of moderate link capacities at the broadcast part ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite characterized the capacity of the diamond channel , which is strictly tighter than the cutset bound . for achievability ,",
    "a coding scheme incorporating multicoding at the source was proposed in @xcite , @xcite . for converse , @xcite used a technique from @xcite to take into account the correlation between the two relay signals . in the presence of a secrecy constraint ,",
    "such converse proof techniques need to be adopted carefully by taking into account the stochastic encoding functions introduced to confuse the eavesdropper . those works @xcite , @xcite were generalized in @xcite for the degraded gaussian diamond - wiretap channel , in which the secrecy capacity was characterized for several ranges of channel parameters . for non - degraded case , however , the coding scheme used in @xcite achieves zero secure d.o.f . and structured codes such as interference alignment and beamforming schemes need to be involved to achieve a positive secure d.o.f .    for the gaussian diamond - wiretap channel in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we establish the exact secure d.o.f . in terms of the link d.o.f.s at the broadcast part , both for the case with full csi and for the case with no eavesdropper s csi .",
    "we assume a fast fading scenario where channel fading coefficients are i.i.d . across the time , but our converse result for the former case and achievability results for both the cases continue to hold when the channel gains are fixed . for the converse part ,",
    "we combine the proof techniques in @xcite with a new technique capturing the trade - off between the message rate and the amount of individual randomness injected at each relay .",
    "our achievability part is based on five key constituent schemes .",
    "in particular , we propose two new schemes that utilize common noise , in a way that the common noise signals are beam - formed in the null space of the legitimate destination s channel .",
    "one of these two schemes is for the case with full csi and is called a simultaneous alignment and beamforming ( s - ab ) scheme , which incorporates alignment of the message and the common noise signals at the eavesdropper .",
    "the proposed s - ab scheme also extends easily to the case with more than two relays and yields the best achievable secure d.o.f .",
    "the other scheme is for the case with no eavesdropper s csi and is called a computation for jamming ( coj ) scheme , which efficiently utilizes the broadcast links by incorporating computation between the message and the common noise symbols at the source .",
    "the remaining three schemes are straightforward extensions of the previously known schemes , i.e. , the cooperative jamming scheme @xcite and blind cooperative jamming scheme @xcite for the gaussian multiple access - wiretap channel and the message - beamforming scheme @xcite for the gaussian miso wiretap channel .    as a natural extension ,",
    "we also consider a generalized gaussian diamond - wiretap channel with more than two relays .",
    "for the brevity of the results , we consider the symmetric case where the link d.o.f.s of the broadcast part are the same . by generalizing the proof techniques used in the two - relay case , we establish the exact secure d.o.f .",
    "for the case with no eavesdropper s csi and present upper and lower bounds on the secure d.o.f . for the case with full csi .",
