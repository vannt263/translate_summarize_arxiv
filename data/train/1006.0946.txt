    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , as the gauge field theory of the strong interaction , reliably predicts scattering cross sections involving short distance partonic interactions . however , the vast majority of hadron - hadron scatterings take place through long - distance strong interactions , where no hard scales are present and perturbative qcd calculations are not possible .",
    "prominent among these soft interactions are diffractive processes , in which the interacting hadrons remain intact or dissociate into low mass hadronic systems via an exchange which has vacuum quantum numbers , often referred to as a ` pomeron ' @xcite . following the observation of diffractive @xmath63 collisions in which a hard scale is provided by high transverse momentum jets @xcite , it has become possible to describe some classes of diffractive processes in terms of partonic interactions @xcite .",
    "more recently , diffractive deep - inelastic scattering ( ddis ) processes at hera @xcite , of the type @xmath64 , have been studied in detail and have led to a new level of understanding of the properties and structure of the diffractive exchange . developing this microscopic description of diffraction in terms of qcd and parton dynamics is a step towards a more complete understanding of the strong interaction .    in the framework of a collinear factorisation theorem @xcite for hard scattering in semi - inclusive processes such as ddis , diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs )",
    "may be defined .",
    "the dpdfs have similar properties to the standard parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton , but with the constraint that there be a leading proton present in the final state .",
    "this condition may be satisfied equivalently by the experimental signatures of either a leading proton @xcite or the presence of a large gap in the rapidity distribution of final state hadrons , separating an unobserved outgoing proton from the remainder of the hadronic final state @xcite . in various extractions using recent ddis data @xcite ,",
    "the dpdfs have been found to be dominated by gluons . to good approximation",
    "they exhibit a ` proton vertex factorisation ' property , whereby they vary only in normalisation with the four - momentum of the final state proton , the normalisation being well modelled using regge phenomenology @xcite .    given a knowledge of the dpdfs , perturbative qcd calculations are applicable to other ddis observables .",
    "such calculations have been successful in the prediction of jet @xcite and heavy quark @xcite production in ddis at hera . in both cases ,",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions using the dpdfs from @xcite describe the measured cross sections well .",
    "however , as has long been anticipated @xcite , dpdf - based predictions for hard diffractive processes such as dijet production in @xmath63 scattering fail by around an order of magnitude to describe the data  @xcite .",
    "this factorisation breaking is generally attributed to absorptive corrections , corresponding to the destruction of the rapidity gap due to multiple interactions within a single event .",
    "such effects are possible in @xmath63 scattering , where a beam remnant is present , in contrast to the electron scattering case in ddis at hera .",
    "a diversity of models of the absorptive corrections has developed @xcite , several of which reproduce the approximate @xmath65 ` rapidity gap survival probability ' observed in single diffractive @xmath63 scattering .",
    "the issues of dpdf applicability and rapidity gap survival can be studied in @xmath6 collisions at hera in hard diffractive ` photoproduction ' , where the virtuality @xmath66 of the exchange photon is close to zero . under these circumstances ,",
    "the photon can develop an effective partonic structure via @xmath67 fluctuations and further subsequent splittings @xcite . in a leading order picture , there are thus two classes of hard photoproduction : ` direct ' interactions , where the photon enters the hard scatter as a structureless object and ` resolved ' interactions , where the photon interacts via its partonic structure and only a fraction @xmath68 of its four - momentum participates in the hard subprocess .",
    "resolved photoproduction interactions can be further divided into a ` hadron - like ' contribution and an ` anomalous ' or ` point - like ' contribution , the latter arising from the inhomogeneous term in the dglap equation for the photon @xcite . interactions involving the hadron - like component resemble hadron - hadron scattering to a large extent and are therefore widely expected to exhibit gap destruction effects .",
    "the rapidity gap survival probability for these hadron - like processes has been estimated in a phenomenological model to be @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the point - like contribution to photon structure is expected to be subject to smaller absorptive corrections than the hadron - like part @xcite . in a recent model @xcite a survival probability of around @xmath70",
    "was obtained for diffractive dijet photoproduction , depending slightly on the jet transverse energies ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "previous h1 measurements of diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite have found cross sections to be smaller than nlo theoretical predictions , suggesting rapidity gap survival probabilities of around @xmath72 with little dependence on @xmath68 .",
    "a recent zeus measurement at somewhat larger @xmath71 @xcite yielded a larger survival probability , compatible with unity .",
    "it has been proposed that this apparent discrepancy may be resolved if the rapidity gap survival probability depends on the scale of the hard interaction , an idea which is supported to some extent by data @xcite .",
    "neither h1 nor zeus data provide any evidence for the expected @xmath68 dependence of the rapidity gap survival probability .",
    "a measurement of the ratio of the diffractive to the inclusive dijet photoproduction cross sections was proposed in  @xcite as a means of evaluating the gap survival probability .",
    "this ratio is expected to be relatively insensitive to the model of the photon parton densities and also offers cancellations of experimental systematics and higher order qcd corrections .",
    "a similar ratio was measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite as a means of extracting effective @xmath73 dpdfs for comparison with hera predictions and assessment of gap survival probabilities .    this paper reports diffractive dijet photoproduction cross section measurements based on a positron - proton scattering data sample with luminosity about a factor three larger than that previously published by h1 @xcite .",
    "the larger sample makes double - differential measurements possible , giving greater detail on the dynamics of gap survival and allowing studies of the correlations between the kinematic variables .",
    "the hypothesis of an @xmath71 dependent rapidity gap survival probability is tested .",
    "the ratio of the diffractive to the inclusive dijet photoproduction cross sections is also extracted for the first time .",

    "have shown a clear preference for these dpdfs over the fit a set from @xcite .",

    "all of these dpdf sets assume proton vertex factorisation , such that @xmath109 in the interpretation illustrated in figure  [ fig : dirresfeyn ] , @xmath110 may be considered as a pomeron flux , parameterised using regge phenomenology in the dpdf sets used here .",
    "the @xmath111 factor then represents the parton densities of the pomeron . at relatively large values of @xmath112 a small contribution from a sub - leading meson exchange is required in the dpdf fits .",

    "the scale uncertainty corresponds to the effect of simultaneously varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales from their central values , @xmath114 , by a factor of two in either direction .",
    "this large ( @xmath226 ) scale uncertainty arises due to the relatively low @xmath121 range of this analysis , and is the limiting factor in the comparison between data and theory .",

    "these ratios may be taken as measurements of the dependence of the rapidity gap survival probability on the kinematic variables .",
    "figures  [ fig : sigma single ] and  [ fig : sigma single ratio ] show that the suppression by around a factor of @xmath4 of the data with respect to the fr fit b nlo calculations has at most a weak dependence on the kinematic variables .",
    "notably , within the uncertainties there is no dependence on @xmath207 ( figure  [ fig : sigma single ratio](a ) ) , in contrast to theoretical predictions for the rapidity gap survival probability @xcite .",
    "the largest dependence of the central values of the measured ratios on any of the variables appears in the cross section differential in @xmath121 ( figure  [ fig : sigma single ratio](b ) ) .",
    "although not well established by the current data , this dependence is compatible with previous data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath121 dependence is investigated further in section  [ double : diff ] .    the measured cross sections in figure  [ fig : sigma single ] are also compared with a prediction obtained using the rapgap mc generator ( section  [ sec : mc ] ) , which does not contain any model of rapidity gap destruction .",
    "the shapes of the measured cross sections are well described and the normalisation is only slightly lower than that of the data . however",
    "the scale uncertainty in this model is rather large and the same model undershoots diffractive dijet measurements in dis @xcite , where factorisation is expected to hold .",
    "in @xcite , the zeus collaboration presented an analysis of diffractive dijet photoproduction data with @xmath235 , which is most readily compared with the second and third @xmath121 intervals in figures  [ fig : sigma single](b ) and  [ fig : sigma single ratio](b ) .",
    "however , even for @xmath235 , a direct comparison between h1 and zeus data is not possible , since the zeus analysis covers a wider @xmath80 range and cuts on the second jet at an @xmath159 value of @xmath236 , larger than the value used here .",

    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , the error bands on the dpdfs extracted from inclusive diffraction alone do not include uncertainties due to parton parameterisation choices and thus do not reflect the full uncertainties , particularly in the large @xmath171 region . to give a complementary indication of the possible range of variation , comparisons between the ratios obtained with the h1 2006 fit b dpdfs , the h1 2007 fit jets dpdfs and zeus dpdf sj fit are shown for a subset of variables ( @xmath207 , @xmath121 and @xmath171 ) in figure  [ fig : ratiodpdfs ] .",

    "the deviation of the h1 2007 fit jets result from the h1 2006 fit b result extends beyond the dpdf error band for @xmath239 , which is correlated with a somewhat stronger dependence of the ratio of data to theory on @xmath121 and a slightly different shape at low @xmath207 .",
    "according to the rapgap model , approximately half of the cross section in the kinematic range studied arises from each of the direct and resolved photon - induced contributions .",
    "the decomposition of photoproduction processes into direct and resolved interactions is not uniquely defined beyond lo . when modelling rapidity gap survival probabilities in the following , the resolved photon contribution is defined to correspond exactly to that which is calculated using the photon structure function .",
    "following the calculation using an absorptive model of a gap survival probability of @xmath69 for the hadron - like component of resolved photoproduction @xcite , previous h1 data @xcite were compared in @xcite with predictions in which the full resolved photon contribution was suppressed by this factor , the direct photon contribution being left unsuppressed . in a later analysis @xcite , this procedure was extended to nlo .",
    "the conclusions of these previous studies are confirmed in figures  [ fig : sigma single res supp ] and  [ fig : sigma single ratio res supp ] through a similar comparison of the current data with nlo calculations in which the resolved photon contribution is globally suppressed by a factor of 0.34 .",
    "the overall normalisation of this calculation is in good agreement with the data .",
    "however , the shapes of some of the differential distributions are not well reproduced .",
    "in particular , there is a variation by more than a factor of two in the ratio of data to theory as a function of @xmath207 ( figure  [ fig : sigma single ratio res supp]a ) .",
    "the distinction between point - like and hadron - like resolved photon interactions recently developed in @xcite leads to a significantly weaker predicted suppression in the kinematic range of the current analysis .",
    "the data are compared with this refined ` kkmr ' model under the approximation of completely neglecting hadron - like resolved photon contributions , which , according to the authors , become dominant only for @xmath240 @xcite , beyond the range of the current analysis .",
    "the rapidity gap survival probabilities obtained in @xcite for point - like photon interactions using the grv ho photon pdfs are applied to all resolved photon interactions .",
    "interactions involving quarks and gluons from the photon are thus suppressed by factors of @xmath241 and @xmath242 , respectively .",
    "the quark - initiated contribution is dominant throughout the measured range , such that the rapidity gap survival probability in the model is approximately @xmath243 for resolved photon interactions and @xmath244 for direct photon interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma single res supp ] shows the comparison between the measured single differential cross sections and the nlo qcd predictions , with the resolved photon contribution scaled according to the kkmr model .",
    "the corresponding ratios of data to theoretical predictions are shown in figure  [ fig : sigma single ratio res supp ] .",
    "the overall normalisation of the kkmr - based calculation is larger than that of the data , but is compatible within the large uncertainties .",
    "many of the distributions studied are well described in shape ( @xmath121 , @xmath171 , @xmath232 , @xmath83 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "the data thus agree with the prediction @xcite that the @xmath121 dependence of the data / theory ratio flattens if the resolved photon contribution alone is suppressed .",
    "however , there remains a variation in the ratio of data to the kkmr model with @xmath207 and to a lesser extent with @xmath231 , @xmath91 and @xmath233 .",
    "a comparison of figures  [ fig : sigma single ratio ] and  [ fig : sigma single ratio res supp ] shows that the shapes of the differential cross sections are generally better described with a global suppression factor than with a survival probability applied to resolved photon interactions only .      to study further the dynamics of rapidity gap suppression and their dependence on the nature of the photon interaction , cross sections are measured double differentially in two regions of @xmath207 , which are enriched with either resolved ( @xmath245 ) or direct ( @xmath246 ) photon processes .",
    "using the rapgap mc model with the grv - g lo photon pdfs , the @xmath245 region is estimated to contain @xmath247 resolved photon interactions integrated over the measurement region ( table  [ tab : kinrange ] ) , with a @xmath248 direct photon contribution for @xmath246 .    in figures  [ fig : sigma et xg 1](a)-(c ) , measurements are presented of the double - differential dijet cross section @xmath249 for three @xmath121 ranges in the resolved and direct photon - enriched @xmath207 intervals .",
    "the data are compared with the fr fit b calculations and with the rapgap mc predictions . due to kinematic constraints ,",
    "the resolved - enriched cross section at low @xmath207 falls most rapidly as @xmath121 increases .",
    "there is a suggestion that this @xmath121 dependence in the resolved - enriched region is stronger for the nlo qcd theory than for the data . in the direct - enriched high @xmath207 region",
    ", the cross section falls more slowly with @xmath121 and the dependence in the data is similar to that predicted by the nlo calculation .",
    "these features are illustrated further in figures  [ fig : sigma et xg 1 ]  ( d)-(e ) , where the ratios of the data to the nlo theory from figures  [ fig : sigma et xg 1 ]  ( a)-(c ) are presented as a function of @xmath121 in the resolved and direct photon - enriched @xmath207 regions , respectively .",
    "the significance of the @xmath121 dependence in the resolved - enriched region ( figure  [ fig : sigma et xg 1 ]  ( d ) ) is evaluated through a @xmath250 test .",
    "all uncertainties are taken into account in this procedure , though the main contribution comes from the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties on the data , the remaining uncertainties changing only the normalisation of the ratio to first approximation . a test of the hypothesis that there is no @xmath121 dependence yields a @xmath250 value of 1.36 , with two degrees of freedom , corresponding to an @xmath121 variation at the 73% confidence level .",
    "the suppression of the data relative to the nlo prediction in the direct - enriched large @xmath207 region is , within errors , independent of @xmath121 ( figure  [ fig : sigma et xg 1 ]  ( e ) ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : sigma et xg 1 ]  ( d)-(e ) thus indicate that any @xmath121 dependence of the data - to - theory ratio in figure  [ fig : sigma single ratio](b ) is driven primarily by resolved photon interactions .",
    "an @xmath121 dependence of the gap survival probability is predicted in the kkmr model , due to variations in the size of the @xmath251 dipole produced by the point - like photon splitting , and hence in the absorptive correction .",
    "however the predicted effect is small ( @xmath252 as @xmath121 changes from @xmath253 to @xmath254 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : sigma single ratio](d)-(e ) also indicate that when @xmath121 becomes large , the suppression in the direct region may be stronger than that in the resolved region , which is not expected in any model .",
    "the large uncertainties permit statistical fluctuations in the data or small inadequacies in the theory as possible explanations .    in figure  [",
    "fig : sigma zp xg 1 ] , the cross section is shown double differentially in @xmath171 and @xmath207 .",
    "the measured cross section is compared with the nlo theory as a function of @xmath171 in two bins of @xmath207 in figures  [ fig : sigma zp xg 1 ]  ( a)-(b ) and the ratios of data to theoretical predictions are shown in figures  [ fig : sigma zp xg 1 ]  ( c)-(d ) .",
    "the nlo calculations describe the measured shapes rather well , with no evidence for any variation of the suppression factor between any of the measurement ranges .",
    "the gap survival probability in a region where there are small or no remnants of either the photon or the diffractive exchange ( highest @xmath171 bin in figure  [ fig : sigma zp xg 1]d ) is thus similar to that where both remnants are significant ( lowest @xmath171 bin in figure  [ fig : sigma zp xg 1]c ) .",
    "this remains the case when the h1 2007 fit jets dpdfs are used in place of h1 2006 fit b. in both figures  [ fig : sigma et xg 1 ] and  [ fig : sigma zp xg 1 ] , the rapgap mc prediction gives a satisfactory description of the shapes of the double differential cross sections , the normalisation being slightly lower than that of the data .",
    "measurements of ratios of diffractive to inclusive dijet photoproduction cross sections have been proposed @xcite as a further test of gap survival issues .",
    "their potential advantages over straight - forward diffractive measurements lie in the partial cancellations of some experimental systematics and of theoretical uncertainties due to the photon structure and factorisation and renormalisation scale choices .",
    "the sensitivity to absorptive effects of diffractive - to - inclusive ratios is thus potentially superior to that of pure diffractive cross sections . for the ratio extraction presented here",
    ", inclusive dijet cross sections are measured using data collected in the same period as the diffractive sample . the experimental method and systematic error treatment for the inclusive case",
    "is described in section  [ sec : procedure ] .",
    "it is identical to the diffractive measurement method , with the exception of the large rapidity gap requirements .    at the relatively low transverse energies studied in the present analysis , underlying event effects have a large influence on jet cross sections in inclusive photoproduction  @xcite . here",
    ", the pythia and herwig mc models are used to correct the inclusive data for detector effects , with mi included as described in section  [ sec : mchad ] .",
    "the two models agree rather well on the corrections to be applied to the data .",
    "the average of the results with the two models is therefore used to calculate the corrections and the uncertainty .",
    "the latter is taken from the difference between the results with the two models and is relatively small ( @xmath221 when integrated over the full measured range ) .",
    "the ratios of diffractive to inclusive single - differential dijet cross sections are given numerically in table  [ tabledifftoincl ] and are shown in figure  [ fig : r ] as a function of @xmath207 , @xmath121 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath95 and @xmath83 . due to the partial or complete cancellations of some error sources when forming the ratio ,",
    "the correlated uncertainties are reduced compared with those for the diffractive distributions .",
    "since they give adequate descriptions of the diffractive and inclusive data , respectively , the rapgap and pythia mc models are used to assess the relative sensitivity of the diffractive - to - inclusive ratio to the gap survival and mi effects . with no mi effects included in the pythia model ,",
    "the description of the inclusive data is poor and the ratio of rapgap to pythia exceeds the data by a factor of around 1.5 . as expected , this factor becomes smaller as @xmath121 increases .",
    "however , the shape of the prediction also differs from that of the ratio data for most of the other variables studied , in particular @xmath207 .    the inclusion of the pythia mi model changes the predicted inclusive cross sections , and hence the ratios , substantially .",
    "the ratio of rapgap to pythia then gives an improved description of the shapes of the distributions .",
    "the mi effects alter the predicted ratio by a factor of 0.5 at low @xmath207 , where the resolved photon remnant is most important .",
    "as expected , there is little effect in the direct photon - dominated large @xmath207 region .",
    "the normalisation of the ratio of the models when mi are included is smaller than that of the data .",
    "this partially reflects the rapgap description of the diffractive data ( figure  [ fig : sigma single ] ) and is partially due to an overshoot in the pythia description of the inclusive data .",
    "the fractional reduction in the predicted inclusive cross section when mi are introduced in the pythia model is comparable to the magnitude of the gap survival suppression factor in the diffractive data ( section  [ sec : difdata ] ) . the uncertainties in modelling the mi are large and difficult to quantify .",
    "the precision with which gap survival issues can be unfolded from mi complications in the ratio of diffractive to inclusive data is correspondingly poor .",
    "therefore no strong conclusions can be drawn with our current understanding of mi , despite the relatively good precision of the data .",
    "single and double - differential cross sections are measured for diffractive dijet photoproduction and are compared with predictions based on nlo qcd calculations using different sets of dpdfs",
    ". ratios of the measured to the predicted differential cross sections are also studied .",
    "the total diffractive dijet cross section is overestimated by the nlo qcd theory by about a factor of two , which is consistent with previous h1 measurements @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the single - differential cross sections are well described when the h1 2006 dpdf fit b partons are used . a good overall description of the differential cross sections is obtained by applying a global suppression factor of @xmath255 to the nlo calculations . as in similar previous analyses @xcite , there is a suggestion of a dependence of the rapidity gap survival probability on @xmath121 , though the significance of this effect is not large .",
    "if only the resolved photon contribution in the calculation is suppressed by a factor of @xmath69 , as predicted for hadron - like resolved photon interactions @xcite , the overall normalisation of the nlo qcd prediction agrees well with the data .",
    "however , the description of the @xmath256 distribution , which best distinguishes direct from resolved photon interactions , becomes poor .",
    "if rapidity gap survival probabilities expected for point - like resolved photons are applied instead @xcite , the overall normalisation is acceptable and the @xmath121 dependence of the data is better described .",
    "however , the description of the @xmath256 dependence remains problematic .",
    "the analysis of the double - differential cross section @xmath249 indicates that the @xmath121 dependence of the data / theory ratio originates from the resolved photon - enriched region of @xmath207 .",
    "however , the data are also consistent with no dependence on @xmath121 for either of the @xmath207 regions studied .",
    "the ratio of the data to the nlo theory for the double - differential cross section @xmath257 is constant within errors throughout the region studied , indicating that the gap survival probability is insensitive to the presence or nature of remnants of either the photon or the diffractive exchange .",
    "measurements of the ratio of diffractive to inclusive single - differential cross sections are presented as a function of several variables .",
    "the influence of multiple interaction effects in the inclusive data is large in the kinematic range studied here .",
    "the large uncertainties in modelling these multiple interactions preclude strong conclusions about rapidity gap survival on the basis of these data , although a reasonable description of the ratios can be obtained with suitably tuned monte carlo models .",
