    "biological evolution offers a number of important , unsolved problems that are well suited for investigation by methods from statistical physics .",
    "many of these can be studied using complex , interacting model systems far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "areas that have generated exceptional interest among physicists are those of coevolution and speciation .",
    "a large class of coevolution models have been inspired by one introduced by bak and sneppen @xcite , in which species with different levels of  fitness \" compete , and the least fit species and those that interact with it are regularly  mutated \" and replaced by new species with different , randomly chosen fitness .",
    "models in this class exhibit avalanches of extinctions and appear to evolve towards a self - organized critical state @xcite .",
    "although such models may be said to incorporate darwin s principle of  survival of the fittest , \" they are artificial in the sense that mutation and selection are assumed to act collectively on entire species , rather than on individual members of their populations .    in reality , mutations are changes in the genotypes of _ individual organisms _ that are introduced or passed on during reproduction .",
    "these changes in the genotype affect the phenotype ( physical and behavioral characteristics of the organism and its interactions with other organisms ) , and it is on the level of the phenotypes of individuals that competition and selection act . a number of evolution models ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review from a physicist s point of view ) therefore take as their basis a genome in the form of a string of  letters \" as in eigen s quasi - species model of molecular evolution @xcite .",
    "depending on the level of the modeling , the letters of the genomic `` alphabet '' can be a ( possibly large ) number of alleles at a gene locus , or the four nucleotides of a dna or rna sequence @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the alphabet is not of great importance in principle , and it is common in models to use a binary alphabet with the two letters 0 and 1 ( or @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "we believe a fruitful approach to the study of coevolution is one in which selection is provided by interspecies interactions along lines commonly considered in community ecology , while genetic variation is provided by random mutations in the genomes of individual organisms .",
    "an early attempt in this direction is the coupled @xmath4 model with population dynamics introduced by kauffman and johnsen @xcite , but thus far not many similar models have been studied . recently ,",
    "hall , christensen , and collaborators @xcite introduced a model they called the `` tangled - nature '' model , in which each individual lives in a dynamically evolving  fitness landscape \" created by the populations of all the other species .",
    "here we consider a simplified version of this model , in which no individual is allowed to live through more than one reproduction cycle .",
    "this restriction to nonoverlapping generations enables us to both study the model in detail by linear stability analysis and to perform very long monte carlo simulations of its evolutionary behavior . in short , the model consists of populations of different species , on which selection acts through asexual reproduction rates that depend on the populations of all the other species via a constant , random interaction matrix that allows mutualistic , competitive , and predator / prey relations .",
    "in addition to these direct interactions , all individuals interact indirectly through competition for a shared resource .",
    "the competition keeps the total population from diverging .",
    "genetic variety is provided by a low mutation rate that acts on the genomes of individual organisms during reproduction , inducing the populations to move through genotype space .",
    "the resulting motion is intermittent : long periods of stasis with only minor fluctuations are interrupted by bursts of significant change that is rapid on a macroscopic time scale , reminiscent of what is known in evolutionary biology as punctuated equilibria @xcite .",
    "a preliminary report on some aspects of the work reported here is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main foci of the present paper are the structure and stability of communities and the statistical properties of the dynamical behavior on very long ( `` geological '' ) time scales .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] we describe our model in detail , including the detailed monte carlo algorithm used for our simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lsa ] we discuss the properties of the fixed points of the population for the mutation - free version of the model .",
    "many of these properties can be understood analytically within a simple mean - field approach .",
    "a full , probabilistic description of our model is also possible , although the mathematics is somewhat involved . in appendix",
    "[ sec : ab ] we provide , for the sake of completeness , the key equations of this approach . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] we give a detailed report on our large - scale monte carlo simulations and the numerical results , together with a discussion of their relations to the fossil record and to other theoretical models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize our results and give our conclusions and suggestions for future studies .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : int ] , we use a simplified version of the tangled - nature model introduced by hall , christensen , and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it consists of a population of individuals with a genome of @xmath5 genes , each of which can take one of the two values 0 or 1 .",
    "thus , the total number of different genotypes is @xmath6 .",
    "we consider each different genotype as a separate species , and we shall in this paper use the two terms interchangeably .",
    "this is justified by the idea that in the relatively short genomes we can consider computationally , each binary `` gene '' actually represents a group of genes in a coarse - grained sense .    in our version of the model",
    ", the population evolves in discrete , nonoverlapping generations ( as in , e.g. , many insects ) , and the number of individuals of genotype @xmath7 in generation @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the total population is @xmath10 . in each generation , the probability that an individual of genotype @xmath7 produces a litter of @xmath11 offspring before it dies is @xmath12 , while the probability that it dies without offspring is @xmath13 . although the fecundity @xmath11 could be quite complex in reality ( e.g. , a function of @xmath7 on the average , but random both in time and for each individual ) , we here take a simplistic approach and assume it is a constant , independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the main difference from the model of refs .",
    "@xcite is that the generations are nonoverlapping in our model , while individuals in the original model may live through several successive reproduction cycles .",
    "this simplification facilitates theoretical analysis and enables us to make significantly longer simulations than those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the `` opposite '' direction",
    ", the earlier model could be generalized to include non - trivial `` age structures , '' since individuals living through several cycles can be assigned an age , with age - dependent survival and reproductive properties @xcite .    as in the original model @xcite , the reproduction probability @xmath14 is taken as @xmath15 } \\;. \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] here , the verhulst factor @xmath16 @xcite represents an environmental `` carrying capacity '' that might be due to limitations on shared resources , such as space , light , or water .",
    "it prevents the total population from indefinite growth , stabilizing it at @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction matrix @xmath18 expresses pair interactions between different species such that the element @xmath19 gives the effect of the population density of species @xmath20 on species @xmath7 .",
    "thus , a mutualistic relationship is represented by both @xmath19 and @xmath21 being positive , while both being negative models a competitive relationship .",
    "if they are of opposite signs , we have a predator - prey situation . to concentrate attention on the effects of interspecies interactions , we follow refs .",
    "@xcite in setting the self - interactions @xmath22 .",
    "the offdiagonal elements of @xmath19 are randomly and uniformly distributed on @xmath23 $ ] as in ref .",
    "the interaction matrix is set up at the beginning of the simulation and is not changed later , a situation that corresponds to quenched disorder in spin - glass models @xcite .",
    "we note that we have not attempted to give @xmath18 a particularly biologically realistic form .",
    "some possible modifications are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .    in this model",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between genotype ( the @xmath7th specific bit string ) and phenotype ( the @xmath7th row and column of @xmath18 ) .",
    "thus , the phenotype specifies both how the @xmath7th species influences the other species that are either actually or only potentially present in the community ( the @xmath7th column ) and how it is influenced by others ( the @xmath7th row ) .",
    "the reproduction probability @xmath14 provides selection of the `` most fit '' phenotypes according to these `` traits '' ( matrix elements ) and the populations of the other species present in the community .",
    "the effect ( or lack thereof ) of a particular trait depends on the community in which the species exists , just as a cheetah s superior speed is only relevant to survival if fast - moving prey is available .    in each generation , the genomes of the individual offspring organisms are subjected to mutation with probability @xmath24 per gene and individual .",
    "mutated offspring are re - assigned to their new genotypes before the start of the next generation .",
    "this provides the genetic variability necessary for evolution to proceed .    the analytic form of @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , is by no means unique .",
    "for instance , one could use a `` soft dynamic '' @xcite in which the effects of the interactions and the verhulst factor factorize in @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , one could dispense with the exponential and use linear or bilinear relationships instead , as is most common in population biology @xcite .",
    "investigations of the effects of such modifications are left for the future .",
    "our evolution algorithm proceeds in three layers of nested loops .",
    "* loop over generations @xmath8 . *",
    "loop over the @xmath25 populated genotypes @xmath7 in generation @xmath8 .",
    "* loop of length @xmath9 over the individuals of genotype @xmath7 .",
    "each individual produces @xmath11 offspring for generation",
    "@xmath26 with probability @xmath12 , or dies without offspring with probability @xmath13 . in either case ,",
    "no individual survives from generation @xmath8 to generation @xmath26 .",
    "* loop of length equal to the total number of offspring of genotype @xmath7 generated in loop 3a , attempting to mutate each gene of each individual offspring with probability @xmath24 and moving mutated offspring to their respective new genotypes for generation @xmath26 .",
    "though neither our model nor the simulations are deterministic , a number of their gross properties can be understood in terms of a mean - field approximation that ignores statistical fluctuations and correlations .",
    "the time evolution of the populations is then given by the set of difference equations , @xmath27+(\\mu /l)f\\sum_{k(i)}n_{k(i)}(t)p_{k(i)}(\\{n_j(t)\\})+o(\\mu ^2)\\ ; ,    \\label{eq : eom}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 runs over the @xmath5 genotypes @xmath29 that differ from @xmath7 by one single mutation ( i.e. , the hamming distance @xcite @xmath30 ) .",
    "the corrections of @xmath31 correspond to multiple mutations in single individuals . naturally , a full investigation of this equation is highly non - trivial , even in the absence of random noise .",
    "in particular , eq .  ( [ eq : eom ] ) can be regarded as a logistic map in a @xmath32-dimensional space .",
    "logistic maps are known to admit , in general , both fixed points and cycles of non - trivial periods @xcite . to keep both analysis of simulations and theoretical investigations manageable , we choose parameters in such a way that we can focus our attention on fixed points .",
    "of course , what we simulate are stochastic processes .",
    "however , as long as the mutation rate is well below the error threshold for mutational melt - down @xcite , new successful mutations can become fixed in the population before another successful mutant arises .",
    "this results in a separation of time scales between the ecological scale of fluctuations within fixed - point communities and the evolutional scale of the durations of such communities @xcite , which are known as quasi - steady states ( qss ) or quasi evolutionarily stable strategies ( q - ess ) @xcite . by ignoring mutations",
    ", we can make some analytical progress and gain some insight into the nature and stability properties of these qss .      a fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) , defined by @xmath34 is characterized by having only @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) non - vanishing @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq : p ] ) , we see that all single - species fixed points are trivially `` identical , '' with @xmath39 .",
    "this somewhat unrealistic result is just a consequence of our choice of @xmath22 and can be avoided by lifting this restriction .",

    ", the existence of an @xmath33-species fixed point depends critically on the submatrix @xmath41 , with matrix elements @xmath19 in which both @xmath7 and @xmath20 are among the @xmath33 species in question .",

    "we provide just two examples to illustrate the mathematical richness of singular @xmath41 s .",
    "if all elements vanish , then the behavior in this subspace is highly degenerate , with the _ total _ population given again by @xmath42 , regardless of @xmath33 .",

    "the subtlety lies in its stability properties within the @xmath33-species subspace .",
    "first , we remind the reader that , even in the case of @xmath60 , there are a variety of behaviors .",
    "solutions may have a stable fixed point with either monotonic or oscillatory decay of small deviations , or they may show bifurcations , period doubling , and chaos @xcite . in the present study , we are interested in the effects of the interspecies interactions , and we therefore choose to focus on systems with monotonically decaying fluctuations in the noninteracting limit .",
    "this means that small fluctuations about the fixed point must decay as @xmath61 . for the single - species and @xmath62 cases ,",

    "this has been used as an argument that highly connected ecosystems are intrinsically unstable @xcite , contrary to ecological intuition .",
    "however , the matrix that must be studied to determine the internal stability of a fixed point is the community matrix @xmath69 , which has a complicated relationship to the interaction matrix @xmath18 and should not be expected to have a simple element distribution .",
    "in fact , for some bilinear population dynamics models there is numerical evidence that most _ feasible _ fixed points are also internally stable @xcite .",
    "however , the relations between connectivity and stability have not yet been fully clarified and are still being discussed @xcite .    of course , issues of internal stability are somewhat academic for simulations . in practice",
    "an internally unstable fixed point could not be observed for more than a brief time , especially since the populations would be driven away from such fixed points by the noise due to both the birth / death process and the mutations .",
    "since mutations are essential for the long - time evolutionary behavior , the `` external stability '' properties of the fixed - point communities are important .",

    "( [ eq : other ] ) it becomes clear that the success of an invader depends not only on its direct interactions @xmath78 with each of the resident species , but also on the interactions between the resident species through the inverse interaction submatrix @xmath79 .",

    "the number of populated species @xmath25 and the total population @xmath83 are substantially smaller than the number of possible species , @xmath84 .",

    "could be considered a quasi - species in the sense of eigen , with the high - population genotype as the `` wildtype '' @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the model is therefore as one of the coevolution of quasi - species @xcite , in which the successful invasion of a resident community by a mutant represents a speciation event in the lineage of the parent genotype .",
    "most of our simulations were started with a small population of 100 individuals of a randomly selected single genotype , corresponding to the entry into an empty ecological niche by a small group of identical individuals",
    ". however , runs starting from a random number of small populations of different species give essentially the same results .",
    "generally , the initial species are not likely to be stable against mutants , and they usually become extinct within 100 generations . to eliminate any short initial transients , most of the quantitative analyses presented here are based on time series from which the first 4096 generations were removed .",

    "the protection zone surrounding a qss community acts much like the free - energy barrier that separates a metastable state in a physical system from the stable state or other metastable states . in both cases a sequence of improbable mutations or fluctuations",
    "is required to reach a critical state that will lead to major rearrangement of the system .",
    "it is thus natural to investigate in detail the lifetime statistics of individual qss in the way common in the study of metastable decay @xcite . to this effect",
    "we started simulations from each of the ten qss communities discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stab ] and ran until the overlap function with the initial community , @xmath111 became less than 0.5 , at which time the system was considered to have escaped from the initial state .",
    "( we note that the overlap function defined here is simply the cosine of the angle between two unit vectors in the space of population vectors @xmath98 . )",
    "the precise value of the cutoff used is not important , as long as it is low enough to exclude fluctuations during the qss @xcite .",
    "the composition of the population at this time ( the `` exit community '' ) was then recorded and the run terminated .",
    "each individual initial qss was simulated for 300 independent escapes .",
    "the means and standard deviations of the individual lifetime distributions are shown in the last two columns of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the mean lifetimes were found to range over about one order of magnitude , from approximately 10000 to 80000 generations . in most cases",
    "the individual lifetime distributions were exponential ( for which the standard deviation equals the mean ) , or they had an exponential component that described the behavior in the short - time end of the range of observed lifetimes . in about half of the qss studied , a tail of very long lifetimes beyond the exponential part ( indicated by a standard deviation significantly larger than the mean ) was also observed .",
    "we further found that an initial qss does not always escape via the same exit community . typically , the genotypes in the exit community that are not present in the initial qss differ from those in the original community by a hamming distance of two or three .",
    "this picture is quite consistent with the stability properties of the qss discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stab ] .",
    "the range of the lifetimes of the ten qss discussed above was limited : for a period to be identified by eye as a qss , its lifetime could not be too short , while the lifetimes were bounded above by the length of the simulation run .",
    "the variation of a factor of ten within these limits indicates that the dynamical behavior of the system may display a very wide range of time scales .",
    "another indication to this effect is provided by the details of the activity within periods that appear as high - activity in figs .  [ fig : timeser](a ) and  [ fig : spec](a ) .",
    "such detail is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : timeser](b ) and  [ fig : spec](b ) .",
    "statistically , the picture in these expanded figures is similar to the one seen on the larger scale , with shorter quiet periods punctuated by even shorter bursts of activity .",
    "these observations , which are similar to refs .",
    "@xcite , suggest statistical self - similarity at least over some range of time scales .",
    "indications of self similarity have also been seen in fossil diversity records @xcite .    the suggestion of self - similarity that emerges from figs .",
    "[ fig : timeser ] and  [ fig : spec ] makes it natural to investigate the statistics of the durations of active periods and qss over a wider range of time scales than that represented by the ten qss included in table  [ table1 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeser ] we see that a reasonable method to make this distinction is to observe the magnitude of the entropy changes , @xmath112 , and to consider the system to be in the active state if this quantity is above some suitably chosen cutoff .",
    "this cutoff can best be determined from a histogram of @xmath113 , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : periods](a ) .",
    "it shows that the probability density of the entropy derivative consists of two additive parts : a near - gaussian one corresponding to population fluctuations caused mostly by the birth / death process in the qss , and a second one corresponding to large changes during the active periods . from this figure we chose the cutoff as 0.015 , which was used to classify every sampled time point as either active or quiet .",
    "normalized histograms for the durations of the active and quiet periods are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : periods](b ) . about 97.4% of the time",
    "is spent in qss .",
    "the active periods are seen to be relatively short , and their probability density is fitted well by an exponential distribution @xcite . on the other hand , the lifetimes of the qss show a very broad distribution @xcite  possibly a power law with an exponent near @xmath1142 for durations longer than about 200 generations .",
    "we note that there is some evidence of power laws with exponents near @xmath1142 in the distributions of several quantities extracted from the fossil record , such as the life spans of genera or families , and the sizes of extinctions @xcite . however , the fossil data are sparse and extend over no more than one or two decades in time , and they can be fitted almost as well by exponential distributions @xcite .",
    "although our data extend over a much wider range of time scales than the paleontological data , indisputable evidence of a power law remains to be established .",
    "though a few qss of the order of one million generations will certainly appear in every run of @xmath115 generations , more definite conclusions about the statistics of such long qss must await simulations an order of magnitude longer .",
    "another feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : periods](b ) is that the distribution of qss durations changes to a smaller slope below about 200 generations .",
    "a similar effect has been observed in the fossil record of lifetimes of families @xcite .      from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : life ] it is clear that by using a cutoff for the intensity of some variable which is large in the qss and small in the active periods ( but in both cases with fluctuations of unknown distribution ) , it is impossible to classify the periods unambiguously . for example , by increasing the cutoff one can make appear as a single qss period what previously appeared as two successive , shorter qss periods separated by a short active period . since the probability of encountering an extremely large fluctuation in a qss increases proportionally to the length of the qss , this effect will affect the longest periods most severely . the problem with determining a suitable cutoff can be avoided by , instead of concentrating on period statistics , calculating the power spectral density ( psd ) @xcite of variables such as the shannon - wiener diversity index or the total population .",

    "an important issue in evolutionary biology is whether or not the evolving ecosystem is stationary in a statistical sense . in fig .",
    "[ fig : runave ] we show several diversity - related measures , averaged over a moving time window and independent simulation runs .",

    "as seen in the figure , none of these quantities show any signs of a long - time trend over @xmath115 generations .",
    "this is consistent with fossil evidence for constant diversity @xcite .",
    "however , it is in disagreement with simulations of the original version of the tangled - nature model @xcite , in which a slow growth in species richness was observed .",
    "this discrepancy might possibly result from the different forms of the interaction matrix used in the two studies , but it may also be due to the relatively short time series used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for our model ,",
    "a simple , combinatorial phase - space argument ( containing neither the individual population sizes nor the mutation rate ) indicates that the most probable number of major genotypes should indeed be limited .",

    "a community of @xmath33 genotypes can be chosen in @xmath132 different ways and is influenced by @xmath133 different pairs of @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",

    "thus , a stable @xmath33-species community can be formed in approximately @xmath136 ways , which obeys the recursion relation @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",

    "[ fig : runave ] may be fortuitous since the dependence of @xmath143 on @xmath134 is only logarithmic .",
    "another question of interest is whether the limited size of the genome leads to `` revisiting '' of genotypes and communities .",
    "the answer is affirmative and indicates the importance of further studies of the effects of the genome size on the long - time dynamical behavior . for genotypes",
    "the question of revisits is easy to answer , and the results for a single run of @xmath115 generations are shown in fig .",

    "the result with the parameter values used in this paper is of the order of @xmath151 .",

    ", points far below the diagonal represent `` throwbacks '' to the vicinity of earlier prototype communities .",
    "note that the density of points is much higher just below the diagonal , implying that a large portion of the revisited communities are `` fluctuation related . '' to highlight these differences , we show the cumulative probability of the ratio @xmath180 in fig .",
    "[ fig : commvis](c ) , in which the lower curve corresponds to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : commvis](b ) . for the case of @xmath181 ( lower curve ) , we see that about 60% of the revisits can be regarded as `` fluctuation related '' ( with @xmath182 ) , while the rest are `` throwbacks . ''",
    "roughly , the latter component appears to be distributed uniformly over all earlier times .",
    "the upper curve shows the corresponding result for @xmath168 .",

( [ eq : p ] ) ] , which corresponds to a nonlinear population - dynamics model of the community ecology , while the genetic variability necessary for evolution is provided by a low rate of mutations that act on individual organisms during reproduction .    at the low mutation rate studied here ,",
    "the model provides an intermittent , statistically self - similar behavior , characterized by periods of relative calm , interrupted by bursts of rapid turnover in genotype space . during the quiet periods , or quasi - steady states ( qss ) , the population consists of a community of a relatively small number of mutualistically interacting genotypes .",

    "are statistically stationary , and there is no evidence that any particular quantity is being optimized as the system moves through genotype space . in that sense , the dynamical behavior can probably best be described as a neutral drift @xcite .",

    "examples include the importance of the connectivity of the interaction matrix , correlated interspecies interactions @xcite , and interaction structures corresponding to food webs with distinct trophic levels .    despite all these caveats , we find it encouraging that such a simple model of coevolution with individual - based dynamics can produce punctuated equilibria , power - law distributions , and @xmath1 noise consistent with current theories of biological macroevolution .",
