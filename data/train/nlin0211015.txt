    "cellular automata ( ca ) has been one of the most studied fields in the research of complex systems .",
    "various patterns has been generated by choosing the rule tables .",
    "wolfram@xcite has classified these patterns into four rough categories : class i ( homogeneous ) , class ii ( periodic ) , class iii ( chaos ) and class iv ( edge of chaos ) .",
    "the class iv patterns have been the most interesting target for the study of ca , because it provides us with an example of the self - organization in a simple system and it is argued that the possibility of computation is realized by the complexity at the edge of chaos@xcite . + a more detailed classification of ca , has been carried out mainly for the elementary cellular automata ( 3-neighbor and 2-state ca)@xcite , in which the pattern is studied quite accurately for each rule table .",
    "however the number of rule table in n - neighbor and k - state cellular automata grows like @xmath3 .",
    "therefore except for a few smallest combinations of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the numbers of the rule tables become so large that studies of the ca dynamics for all rule tables are impossible even with the fastest supercomputers .",
    "+ on the other hand the rule table of edge of chaos is rare in the whole ca rule table space , therefore it is important to find a set of parameters by which the pattern classes could be classified , and to determine a phase diagram of ca in these parameter space , even if it is a qualitative one .",
    "+ langton has introduced @xmath1 parameter and argued that as @xmath1 increases the pattern class changes from class i to class ii and then to class iii . and in many cases , class iv behavior is observed between class ii and class iii patterns@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter represents rough behavior of ca in the rule table space , but finally does not sufficiently classify the quantitative behavior of ca .",
    "it is well known that different pattern classes coexist at the same @xmath1 .",
    "which of these pattern classes is chosen , depends on the random number .",
    "the reason or mechanism for this is not yet known ; we have no way to control the pattern classes at fixed @xmath1 . and",
    "the transitions between a periodic to chaotic pattern classes are observed in a rather wide range of @xmath1 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a schematic phase - diagram was sketched .",
    "however a vertical axis was not specified .",
    "therefore , it is has been thought that more parameters are necessary to arrive at a more quantitative understanding of the rule table space of the ca .",
    "+ in this article , we will report a mechanism which discriminates the pattern classes at a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the mechanism is closely related to the structure of the rule tables and is expressed by the numbers of rules which breaks strings of quiescent state . for n - neighbor and k - state ca",
    ", it is found that in the region @xmath6 , the class ii , class iii and class iv pattern classes coexist .",
    "+ this property is studied quantitatively by introducing a new parameter @xmath2 , which is taken to be orthogonal to @xmath1 . in the region",
    "@xmath6 , the maximum of @xmath2 correspond to class iii rule tables while minimum of @xmath2 , to class ii or class i rule tables .",
    "therefore the transition of the pattern classes takes place somewhere between these two limits without fail .",
    "if we determine the region of @xmath2 , where the transitions of the pattern classes take place , we could obtain the phase diagram in @xmath7 plane .",
    "+ the determination of the phase diagram is carried out for 5-neighbor and 4-state ca . in this case ,",
    "phase boundary is not sharp but has some range in @xmath7 plane .",
    "the region has a gentle slope as a function of @xmath1 , and extends over the range @xmath8 .",
    "this means that for this ca the edge of chaos could be found at least in this range in @xmath1 .",
    "+ in section 2 , we will briefly summarize our notations and present a key discovery , which leads us to the understanding of the structure of the rule table and pattern classes .",
    "it strongly suggested that the rules which break strings of the quiescent states play an important role for the pattern classes .",
    "+ in section 3 , we classify rule tables according to the destruction and construction of strings of the quiescent states , and carry out the replacements of the rules to change the chaotic pattern class into periodic one and vice versa while keeping @xmath1 fixed .",
    "the reason why the patten classes changes by the replacements is discussed , and we will show that in the region @xmath9 , the change of the pattern classes takes place without fail by the replacements .",
    "+ in section 4 , the result obtained in section 3 is studied quantitatively by introducing a new parameter @xmath2 . using @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    ", we determine the phase diagram in the @xmath7 plane for 5-neighbor and 4-state ca .",
    "+ section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "in order to make our arguments concrete , we focus mainly on the one - dimensional 5-neighbor and 4-state ca in the following , however , the qualitative conclusions hold true for other cas .",
    "this point will be discussed in subsections 3.2 .",
    "+ we will briefly summarize our notation of ca@xcite . in our study , the site consists of 150 cells having the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the states are denoted as @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 represents the time step which takes an integer value , and the @xmath12 is the position of cells which range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath10 takes values @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the state @xmath13 is taken to be the quiescent state .",
    "the set of the states @xmath10 at the same @xmath11 is called the configuration .",
    "+ the configuration at time @xmath17 is determined by that of time @xmath11 by using following local relation , @xmath18 the set of the mappings @xmath19 is called the rule table .",
    "the rule table consists of @xmath20 mappings , which are selected from a total of @xmath21 elements .",
    "+ the @xmath1 parameter is defined as@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number in which @xmath24 in eq.[r_table ] is not equal to @xmath13 . in other words",
    "the @xmath1 is the probability that the rules do not select the quiescent state in next time step . in the following we set the rule tables randomly with the probability @xmath1 .",
    "we choose @xmath25 rules randomly , and set @xmath26 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ lambda ] . for the rest of the @xmath23 rules",
    ", the @xmath24 picks up the number @xmath27 randomly .",
    "the initial configurations are also set randomly .",
    "+ the time sequence of the configurations is called a pattern . the patterns are classified roughly into four classes established by wolfram@xcite . it has been known that as the @xmath1 increases the most frequently generated patterns change from homogeneous ( class i ) to periodic ( class ii ) and then to chaotic ( class iii ) , and at the region between class ii and class iii , the edge of chaos ( class iv ) is located .      in order to find the reason why the different pattern classes are generated with the same @xmath1 , we have started to collect rule tables of different pattern classes , and tried to find the differences between them .",
    "we have fixed at @xmath28 @xmath29 , because at this point the chaotic , edge of chaos , and periodic patterns are generated with a similar ratio . by changing the random number , we have gathered a few tens of the rule tables and classified them into chaotic , edge of chaos , and periodic ones .",
    "+ in this article , a pattern is considered the edge of chaos when its transient length@xcite is longer than @xmath30 time steps .",
    "+ first , we study whether or not the pattern classes are sensitive to the initial configurations .",
    "we fix the rule table and change the initial configurations .",
    "the details of the patterns depend on the initial configurations , but the pattern classes are not changed@xcite .",
    "thus the difference of the pattern classes is due to the differences in the rule tables , and the target of our inquiry has to do with the differences between them .",
    "+ for a little while , we do not impose a quiescent condition ( qc)@xcite , + @xmath31 , because without this condition , the structure of the rule table becomes more transparent .",
    "this point will be discussed at the footnote 4 in section 4 .",
    "+ after some trial and error , we have found a strong correlation between the pattern classes and the qc . for class ii patterns , the probability of the rule table , which satisfies the qc is much larger than that of the class iii patterns .",
    "this correlation has suggested that the rule @xmath32 , which breaks the string of the quiescent states with length 5 , pushes the pattern toward chaos .",
    "we anticipate that the similar situation will hold for the strings of quiescent states with length 4 . + we go back to the usual definitions of ca . in the following we discuss ca under qc , @xmath31 .",
    "we study the correlation between the number of the rules of eq.[d4 ] and the pattern classes : @xmath33 these rules break length 4 strings of the quiescent states , and will also push the pattern toward chaos .",
    "we denote the total number of rules of eq.[d4 ] in a rule table as @xmath34 .",
    "we have collected 30 rule tables and grouped them by the number @xmath34 .",
    "we have 4 rule tables with @xmath35 , 13 rule tables with @xmath36 , 9 rule tables with @xmath37 and 4 rule tables with @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath39 , all rule tables generate chaotic patterns , while when @xmath38 , only periodic ones are generated . at @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "chaotic , edge of chaos , and periodic patterns coexist .",
    "examples are shown in the fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44 ] .",
    "the coexistence of three pattern classes at @xmath36 is seen in fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44](b ) , fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44](c ) and fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44](d ) and that of @xmath37 is exhibited in fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44](e ) , fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44](f ) and fig.[pattern_at_lambda0.44](g ) .",
    "+    the strong correlation between @xmath34 and the pattern classes has been observed in this case too , as anticipated .",
    "these discoveries have provided us with a key hint leading us to the hypothesis that the rules , which break strings of the quiescent states , will play a major role in the pattern classes .",
    "in order to test the hypothesis of the previous section , we classify the rules into four groups according to the operation on strings of the quiescent states . in the following , greek characters in the rules represent groups @xmath40 while roman , represent groups @xmath27 .",
    "+ group 1 : @xmath41 .",
    "+ the rules in this group break strings of the quiescent states . + group 2 : @xmath42 .",
    "+ the rules of this group conserve them .",
    "+ group 3 : @xmath43 .",
    "+ the rules of this group develop them .",
    "+ group 4 : @xmath44 .",
    "+ the rules in this group do not affect string of quiescent states in next time step .",
    "+ the sum of the numbers of the group 1 and group 2 rules is 256 , while that of group 3 and group 4 rules is 768 . the number of each group of rules included in the rule table is determined mainly by the probability @xmath1 , therefore it suffers from fluctuation due to randomness . + the group 1 rules are further classified into five types according to the length of string of quiescent states , which they break .",
    "these are shown in table [ destruc ] .",
    "[ destruc ]    .",
    "the classification of the rules in group 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using these results for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we calculate @xmath2s for each critical combination ( @xmath47 ) . for @xmath48 , they are shown in fig.[phase_diagram_0.6]a for 101 data points .",
    "the number distributions of them are displayed in fig.[phase_diagram_0.6]b . from these 101 data , we calculate average , @xmath49 and standard deviation @xmath50 of the distribution of @xmath47 .",
    "similar calculations are carried out for other @xmath1 points .",
    "the results for @xmath49 , @xmath51 and maximum of @xmath2 ( @xmath52 ) determined by the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 are shown in the fig.[phase_diagram ] .",
    "this is a phase diagram in @xmath7 plane .",
    "+ the phase diagram is natural in the sense that as @xmath1 increases , the proportion of the chaotic rule table region increases in the total @xmath2 range .",
    "the two lines @xmath51 in the figure , indicate that about @xmath53 of the critical combinations are located in this region , if the normal distribution is assumed for @xmath47 .",
    "we call this region as transition region .",
    "we think that the class ii and class iii patterns would not be separated by a line in @xmath7 plane . because the transition region in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] is a mapping of the hyper - surface , which separates the two pattern classes at a fixed @xmath1 in 1024 dimensional space , into the normal line of the regression plane in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "therefore the two parameters will not be enough to draw the boundary by a line .",
    "+ however we should like to notice that in spite of the simple approximations and assumptions , the @xmath47s distribute within a rather narrow portion of total @xmath2 range as shown in fig .",

    "the region @xmath51 occupies only about @xmath57 of whole range of @xmath2 .",
    "the similar situation is observed for the other @xmath1 points .",
    "+ the fig.[phase_diagram ] is still qualitative but rule table space of ca is classified much better by using @xmath1 and f. and it provides us with a deeper understanding of the structure of the ca rule table space .",
    "the existence of the transition region in @xmath58 , means that the edge of the chaos could be found at least in this region , which is rather wide range in @xmath1 .",
    "+    let us discuss the distribution of the rule tables around the transition region .",
    "all the class iv rule tables are located around transition region as fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram_0.6 ] shows , but converse is not true . in this region ,",
    "the three pattern classes coexist and the number densities of the class ii plus class iii rule table are considerably larger than that of class iv rule tables . outside of the transition region , the probability of finding the class iv rule table decreases rapidly and the pattern classes began to be classified only by the position in the @xmath7 plane ; in the @xmath59 region , class iii rule tables dominates while in the @xmath60 region , class ii or class i ca dominates .",
    "the similar distributions of the rule tables are observed at @xmath61 , 0.75 , 0.7 , 0.5 , 0.4 , 0.3 and 0.2 .",
    "+ we proceed to the investigation of the end points of the transition region . in the subsection 3.2 , we have find the region of @xmath1 , where both chaotic limit and periodic limit coexist . in the 5-neighbor and k - state ca , it is @xmath62 . in @xmath63 region ,",
    "not all the group 2 rules could be replaced by the group 1 rules . therefore the maximum of @xmath64 could not become 256 , and it deceases to zero as @xmath1 approaches to zero .",
    "then the maximum of @xmath2 , ( @xmath52 ) also decreases to zero toward @xmath65 .",

    "at a fixed @xmath1 , the patten classes of the ca could be controlled by the numbers of the group 1 rules , which has been denoted by @xmath64 .",
