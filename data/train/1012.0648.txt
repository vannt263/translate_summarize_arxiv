    "the dual superconductor picture proposed long ago @xcite is believed to be a promising mechanics for quark confinement . for this mechanism to work , however , magnetic monopoles and their condensation are indispensable to cause the dual meissner effect leading to the linear potential between quark and antiquark , namely , area law of the wilson loop average . the abelian projection method proposed by t hooft @xcite can be used to introduce such magnetic monopoles into the pure yang - mills theory even without matter fields . indeed , numerical evidences supporting the dual superconductor picture resulting from such magnetic monopoles",
