    "it is well known that there are different kinds of kinematics on homogeneous ( 3 + 1)-d space - times @xcite , and all of them can be contracted from minkowski , de sitter or anti - de  sitter spacetimes under group contraction @xcite , respectively . among them , newton - hooke ( nh ) space - times @xmath1 introduced in @xcite are of special interest as a kind of non - relativistic cosmological models in @xcite .    in this paper , we present a model for the nh space - time @xmath2 based on the beltrami - de  sitter ( @xmath0 ) spacetime @xcite , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "we find that in @xmath2 there exist a kind of special coordinate systems in which the test particles , which none force acts upon , move at constant coordinate velocities along straight lines . in the coordinates , these particles look like free particles rather than the particles driven by a repulsive force provided by the positive cosmological constant in other coordinates , say , the ones contracted from the _ static _ @xmath4 universe @xcite . at the first glance",
    ", this property seems very strange .",
    "why in @xmath2 contracted from the @xmath4 spacetime with constant curvature there exist such a kind of uniform - velocity motions ?",
    "the basic reason is , in fact , that there exist a kind of inertial - type motions in the beltrami model of the @xmath4 spacetime .",
    "such an inertial - type property comes in @xmath2 from the @xmath0 spacetime @xmath3 .    among various models of @xmath4 spacetimes",
    ", the beltrami model is an important one in which @xmath4 spacetime is in analog with minkowski spacetime in the sense that there are inertial - type coordinates , inertial - type motions and they are invariant under fractional linear transformations of a 10-parameter group  @xmath4  group @xmath5 .",
    "it is precisely the beltrami model @xcite of a 4-hyperboloid @xmath6 in the 5-d minkowski spacetime . in @xmath3 ,",
    "a set of beltrami coordinate systems covers @xmath6 patch by patch and test particles and light signals move along the timelike and null geodesics , respectively , at _ constant _ coordinate velocities .",
    "therefore , they look like in free motions in a spacetime without gravity .",
    "thus , the beltrami coordinates and observers @xmath7 in these systems may be regarded as of  global inertial - type \" .",
    "this is why there is such a merit of the nh contraction from @xmath0 spacetime that in @xmath8 there remain inertial - type coordinates and inertial - type observers .",
    "this also shows that the usual algebraic definition of the nh limit can not determine the contraction of geometry uniquely because of free choice of coordinates if coordinates have no fundamental physical meaning . in particular , for the same kind of",
    "coordinates the contraction depends on what dimension of the coordinates might be chosen . in order to determine the unique nh limit",
    ", we should supplement certain physical conditions .",
    "we argue that the suitable physical conditions should be the counterpart of galilean relativity principle in @xmath2 , which is named the galilei - hooke s relativity principle , and the postulate on newton - hooke universal time @xmath9 , which satisfies @xmath10 and the latter is invariant under the newton - hooke contraction of @xmath11 , i.e. the limit of infinite signal - velocity @xmath12 and the curvature radius @xmath13 of the @xmath0 spacetime .",
    "the newton - hooke universal time is similar to the newton s universal time in newtonian mechanics in the sense that it is separated from space in the metric .",
    "we also find that there is something interesting in @xmath2 , which is closely related to the violation of euclid s fifth axiom . in newtonian mechanics and special relativity ,",
    "a particle in inertial motion can be stationary in only one inertial frame .",
    "if an inertial frame @xmath14 has a relative velocity in another one , @xmath15 , the relative velocity will be constant at every time and every point . in @xmath2 , however , it is possible that a particle in inertial - type motion can be at rest in two different inertial - type frames . in this case",
    "the velocity of @xmath14 relative to @xmath15 will be different from point to point .",

    ", the geometry becomes d^2= dt^2 , and d l^2 = ^2(t)dl^2__t . in this case , time spans a 1-d euclidean metric space while the spatial space is conformal to the 3-d euclidean metric space .",
    "the conformal factor depends on time @xmath161 .",
    "as was noted previously , in @xmath21 spacetime we can define two different kinds of simultaneity . in the nh limit , however , the two kinds of definition of simultaneity coincide as was mentioned in the previous section because of eq.([tmetric ] ) .",
    "if one introduces dimensionless spatial beltrami coordinates such that x^i= 1 r x^i , then _",
    "= 1 - x^ix^i / r^2=1-x^i x^i and the robertson - walker - like metric can be rewritten as ds^2 = c^2 dt^2-r^2 ^ 2(ct / r)dl^2 , where @xmath162 is the line - element on the unit 3-sphere , which is dimensionless .",
    "now , taking the nh limit , in which the dimensionless coordinates @xmath163 are kept finite , we get [ nrds ] d^2= dt^2- 1 ^2 ^2 ( t)dl ^2 . in this case , the concept of spacetime and de sitter group as well remain even in the nh limit !",
    "namely , the ` contraction ' is trivial in the group , algebra and geometry aspects !",
    "it is also the case for the beltrami metric ( [ bhl ] ) if the spatial coordinates chosen as of dimensionless .",
    "similar uniqueness problem also appears in other forms of de sitter spacetime .",
    "for example , for @xmath164 de sitter metric , [ nhk0 ] & & ds^2 = c^2 d|t^2 - e^2c|t / r(d|r^2 + |r^2 d^2 ) + & &    d^2=d|t^2 , d l^2 = e^2|t(d |r^2 + |r^2 d^2 ) , & |r   keeps   finite .",
    "+ d^2 = d|t^2 - 1 ^2 e^2|t(d^2 + ^2 d^2 ) , & = |r / r   keeps   finite .    for the static de sitter metric , [ sds ] & & ds^2 = ( 1-r^2/r^2)c^2 dt^2 - -r^2 d^2 + & &    d^2=dt^2 , dl^2 = dr^2+r^2 d^2 , & r   keeps   finite .",
    "+ d ^2 = ( 1-^2)dt^2 - 1 ^2 ( + ^2 d^2 ) , & r = r/r   keeps   finite .    if one requires @xmath165 , and @xmath166 keep finite or requires one or two of spatial coordinates @xmath167 keep finite , then one may get different contractions of the same geometry ( see , appendix [ appdx : limit ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the starting point of ref.@xcite is the static de sitter metric . under the nh limit in the first manner in eq.([sds ] ) , @xmath112 is equal to the proper time and the spatial coordinates @xmath168 satisfy @xmath169 .",
    "when such a coordinate system is chosen , free particles in the nh limit of @xmath4 spacetime obeys [ gnhgeod ] = ^2 q^i .",
    "it can be proved that it is the contraction of geodesic equation in the static @xmath4 spacetime , too @xcite . from eq.([gnhgeod ] ) , one can not read out that free particles move along straight lines at constant velocities . the relation between coordinates used in @xcite and the beltrami coordinates",
    "is given by the second expression of eq.([tau - t ] ) or = 1 ^-1 t , and q^i= .",
    "it should be noted that in terms of the beltrami coordinates @xmath170 eq.([gnhgeod ] ) turns to be eq.([nuvi ] ) of the inertial - type motion and the non - relativistic energy of a particle , eq.(5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , turns to be eq.([enr ] ) .",
    "these examples show that the condition eq.([nu ] ) is not enough to determine the limit .",
    "is it possible that there exist one or more physical principles to determine the nh limit uniquely ?",
    "the answer is yes . in the following subsections , we propose two principles , galilei - hooke s relativity principle and postulate on newton - hooke universal time @xmath171 , and show that these two principles should fix the nh limit procedure .",
    "recall that in newtonian mechanics , the galilean relativity principle is respected .",
    "the principle states that the laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial frames .",
    "in particular , the first law of newtonian mechanics , which says that a body at rest or in uniform - velocity motion along a straight line remains its state as long as no force acts upon it , is the same in all inertial frames .",
    "therefore , an inertial observer can not determine by local mechanic experiments whether he is at rest or in a uniform - velocity motion along a straight line .",
    "in the previous discussion on the nh limit , the relativity principle is not considered even though the inertial - type motion has been introduced in both @xmath0 spacetime and nh space - time .",
    "we have seen that if in @xmath2 and the constant curvature spacetime resulted from the trivial contraction in previous subsection , the inertial - type motion , the motion at uniform - velocity along straight line in sec .",
    "[ motion ] , is regarded as a genuine inertial motion , if a beltrami coordinate system is regarded as a true inertial coordinate system , and if a set of particles static in a beltrami coordinate system is regarded as an inertial reference frame , then the inertial motion is independent of the choice of inertial frames .",
    "the statement may serve as the counterpart of the first law of newtonian mechanics in @xmath2 and can be expressed in the same way as the first newton s law of mechanics : in @xmath2 a body at rest or in uniform - velocity motion along a straight line remains its state as long as no force acts upon it .",
    "the counterpart of the second newton s law of mechanics may also be set up in @xmath2 as [ 2ndlaw ] = f^i . in @xmath2 , both sides of eq.([2ndlaw ] ) should transform in the same manner under the transformation eq.([gnh ] ) .",
    "now , we may introduce a relativity principle parallel to the galilean relativity principle in newtonian mechanics as follows :    _ the laws of mechanics in the newton - hooke space - time are the same in all inertial frames . _",
    "+ we name it galilei - hooke s relativity principle in honor of galilei and hooke .",
    "( from now on , the ` -type ' in phrases , such as , inertial - type motion , inertial - type observer , inertial - type frame , are removed . )    by use of galilei - hooke s relativity principle , the contraction like the third example in appendix [ appdx : limit ] can be excluded .",
    "furthermore , the limit that @xmath172 while @xmath13 keeps finite can also be excluded by the galilei - hooke s relativity principle .",
    "therefore , the requirement @xmath173 in the non - relativistic approximation of special - like relativity on @xmath21 @xcite can be relaxed because it is the result of the galilei - hooke s relativity principle .",
    "it should be noted that even when the galilei - hooke s relativity principle is respected , it is still not enough to fix the nh limit uniquely .    in order to fix the contraction procedure ,",
    "it is needed to explore what should happen at any given point as the origin of a coordinate system chosen . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the metric at origin is minkowskian and under the nh contraction , it splits to two parts .",
    "the similar situation also happens in the case of static @xmath4 metric . since both spacetime @xmath21 and space - time @xmath2",
    "are homogeneous and isotropic , all points should follow this behavior . note that for the metric at the origin , there is no room for @xmath13 .",
    "thus , this may fix the contraction procedure .",
    "this may also be seen from both the light - cone and the homogeneous lorentz group at the origin .",
    "in fact , we should define the inertial motion , inertial coordinates as well as inertial observers and require two first principles for @xmath0 : the relativity principle and the postulate on universal constants , which require that there exist two universal constants of @xmath12 with dimension of velocity and @xmath13 with dimension of length . as was indicated in @xcite",
    ", the second postulate implies that the light cone at the origin is the same as that in a minkowski spacetime .",
    "the lack of the two principles seems to indicate in mathematics that the contraction procedure may not be fixed by only considering algebraic contraction .",
    "therefore , we propose the second physical principle , the postulate on the newton - hooke universal time :    _ there exits a bounded newton - hooke universal time @xmath174 under the nh limit of @xmath11 , which measures the time of physical processes . _",
    "thus , under the postulate , especially at origin of the ( beltrami ) coordinates , the metric splits to two parts under the limit of @xmath175 . in brief , only considering algebraic contraction is not enough to uniquely determine the nh limit .",
    "one has to supplement two physical principles .",
    "one is the galilei - hooke s relativity principle and the other is the postulate on newton - hooke universal time .",
    "in newtonian mechanics and special relativity , if two particles have the same velocity relative to one inertial frame , they have the same velocity relative to every inertial frame . as a consequense",
    ", there can not be a particle that is at rest at the same time in two different inertial frames .",
    "in addition , in newtonian mechanics and special relativity , any two inertial frames @xmath15 and @xmath14 have the property that all particles being at rest in @xmath14 have the same velocity relative to @xmath15 . in the following",
    ", we shall see these are not the facts in @xmath2 .",
    "similar to what in newtonian mechanics and special relativity , the equation of motion for a free particle is eq.([tp ] ) . especially , when @xmath176 , two coordinate systems for @xmath15 and @xmath14 related by the transformation ( [ gnh ] ) have the same relation as that in newtonian mechanics , except the coordinate time @xmath9 taking value in @xmath177 in @xmath2 . when @xmath178 , however , the velocities of free particles at rest in @xmath14 are different from one another in @xmath15",
    ". this can be seen from the equation of motion of a static particle in @xmath14 in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath179\\,t.\\ ] ] obviously , when @xmath178 , there is a special fixed spatial point @xmath180 in @xmath14 , whose velocity relative to @xmath15 is also zero !",
    "namely , its spatial coordinates in @xmath15 is also fixed at @xmath181 therefore , when @xmath178 , there is always a free particle @xmath182 at rest in both frames @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us select another two distinct particles @xmath183 and @xmath184 such that @xmath183 is static in @xmath15 while @xmath184 is static in @xmath14 .",
    "from the point of view of an observer in @xmath15 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 have the same velocity while @xmath182 and @xmath184 have different velocities . from the point of view of an observer in @xmath14 , it is on the contrary : @xmath182 and @xmath184 have the same velocity while @xmath182 and @xmath183 have different velocities .",
    "so , in this case , the observation that two particles have the same velocity is a phenomenon depending on reference frames : two frames could share a common particle that is static in both of them .",
    "for such a particle it could say that another remote particle is static relative to it while , at the same time , it could deny this statement .",
    "the answer depends on which reference frame it thinks itself belongs to .",
    "customarily , we use an inertial observer to take the place of an inertial frame in which he is static .",
    "this is due to the properties of inertial frames in newtonian mechanics and special relativity . from the above discussion",
    "we find that this is misleading in @xmath2 , because the same inertial observer can be static in distinct inertial frames .",
    "in fact , as we can see more clearly in next section , the choice of the time origin of nh inertial coordinate systems has much more nontrivial meaning than the newtonian case .",
    "especially , the concept of static state is dependent on this choice .    at last , we point out that , whenever @xmath178 , we can shift the spatial origins of @xmath15 and @xmath14 , respectively , so that the transformation from @xmath15 to @xmath14 have the standard form as @xmath185      in this subsection we try to give a clear geometric picture to the nh transformations .",
    "we can see the shadow of projective geometry .    in @xmath2 a 2-d surface @xmath186",
    "is called a timelike plane and a 2-d surface @xmath187 is called a spacelike plane , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are parameters describing the surfaces and @xmath190 , @xmath191 s and @xmath102 are some constants . since eqs.([tlp ] ) and ( [ slp ] ) remain the same forms , respectively , under the nh transformations , the above concepts are well defined .",
    "it can be shown that straight lines on the planes in @xmath2 , which can be expressed by @xmath192 in terms of the parameters @xmath188 and @xmath189 , are also straight lines ( i.e. geodesics ) in @xmath2 . in eq.([lp ] ) , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are some constants , and @xmath188 takes value in @xmath196 for timelike planes and @xmath197 for spacelike planes .",
    "two geodesics in a plane are called parallel lines if they have no common points .",
    "it is obviously that euclid s fifth axiom is valid on spacelike planes but invalid on timelike planes .",
    "applying the same ideas to discuss spacetimes of newtonian mechanics or special relativity , we can find that euclid s fifth axiom is valid for every plane .",
    "this is one of the main difference between @xmath2 and the spacetime in newtonian mechanics or the special relativity .",
    "the concept of straight line , plane and parallel are independent of the choice of beltrami coordinate systems .",
    "that is , if a curve is a straight line in one coordinate system , it is a straight line in all coordinate systems ; if two straight lines are parallel in one coordinate system , they are parallel in all coordinate systems . for an inertial frame @xmath15 , the world lines @xmath198 and @xmath199 are straight lines that are parallel to each other . from the point of view other inertial frame , @xmath14 , say ,",
    "these world lines are still parallel straight lines",
    ". it does represent the invalidity of euclid s fifth axiom that there exists an observer who can sit statically in both @xmath15 and @xmath14 .    to be clearer",

    "it should be noted that @xmath202 is not a possible coordinate time because @xmath203 for simplicity we only consider a plane @xmath204 containing the world line of the spatial origin of the systems , namely , @xmath205 and @xmath206 if the world lines of @xmath207 are shown as in fig.[fig : s ] , the world lines of @xmath208 will be shown , in the same coordinate system , as in fig.[fig : sprime ] . in this figure , these world lines are parallel to each other and are focused on the point @xmath209 on the time axis .",
    "conversely if a congruence of geodesics is focused on a point in @xmath210 ( not necessarily on the time axis ) , we can say that they are the world lines of rest particles in certain an inertial frame",

    "then , @xmath9 and @xmath112 can be linked by the transformation ( [ eq : std ] ) . from eq.([eq : std ] ) and the diagram , we can see @xmath219 are invariant time in @xmath2 .",
    "compared with special relativity in which there exists an invariant velocity @xmath12 , the nh mechanics is a kind of relativity due to the existence of finite extremum time .",
    "we have shown that in @xmath3 , the transformation group between beltrami coordinate systems contracts to @xmath101 group in the nh limit .",
    "the geometry of @xmath0 spacetime splits time and spatial space in the nh limit .",
    "the former may be regarded as a subspace of @xmath220 with metric , while the latter is conformal to a 3-d euclidean space .",
    "the conformal factor depends on time only .",
    "test particles and light signals without force acting upon them move along straight lines at uniform velocity in the nh limit , as expected .",
    "the behavior of uniform - velocity motion along straight lines is independent of the inertial frame which observer is in and the velocity addition law is obtained .",
    "this can be regarded as the key point of galilei - hooke s relativity principle , which together with the postulate on newton - hooke universal time determines the nh limit uniquely .",
    "the contraction of @xmath0 spacetime shows that the beltrami coordinate systems should be regarded as inertial coordinate system both in relativistic and non - relativistic levels since test particles and signals without force acting upon them all move along straight lines at uniform velocities .",
    "this implies that the mechanics in non - zero constant - curvature space - time may be set up in parallel to the one in flat space - time , starting from the relativity principle and inertial law .",
    "the dynamics both at classical and quantum level will be studied elsewhere .",
    "it is remarkable that unlike in newtonian mechanics and special relativity , a free particle in @xmath2 ( and @xmath21 ) can be static at the same time with respect to two different inertial frames which have relative velocity .",
    "this property is closely related to the violation of euclid s fifth axiom . in this sense , the nh limit of @xmath0 spacetime can be regarded as the version of the newtonian mechanics without euclid s fifth axiom .",
    "another remarkable property of @xmath2 is that there is a universal time .",
    "it is similar to the newton s universal time in newtonian mechanics in the sense that it is separated from space in the metric and that the simultaneity is absolute .",
    "however , in any inertial coordinate system , this universal time as the coordinate time should be in the range @xmath221 .",
    "compared with special relativity in which there exists an invariant velocity @xmath12 , the nh mechanics looks like a kind of relativity due to the existence of finite extremum universal time .",
    "it is related to the fact that the generators of spatial translation and boost along the same direction form an @xmath222 vector under the time translation .",
    "[ see , eqs.([eq : mult ] ) , ( [ eq : liealg ] ) , and ( [ eq : c1 ] ) . ] further studies on space - time , group structures , and kinematics and dynamics in the nh limit are needed .",
    "it should be noted that when the nh limit in @xmath3 is taken , the zeroth coordinate @xmath223 . in order eq.([5sphr ] ) to be meaningful , one of @xmath224 , at least , should tend to @xmath225 .",
    "for example , in @xmath226 , @xmath227 while @xmath228 keep finite so that @xmath229 from eq.([u4 ] ) .",
    "the intersection of @xmath28 and @xmath226 , @xmath230 , can only appears at @xmath231 ( and thus @xmath232 ) @xmath159 .    when @xmath233 , namely , @xmath173 faster than @xmath234 , all results become the correspondences in flat space - time .",
    "in particular , the galilei - hooke s relativity principle reduces to the galilean one .",
    "non - relativistic energy of a test particle reduces to the one in the newtonian mechanics .",
    "the nh group reduces to the galilei group .",
    "the newton - hooke universal time becomes newton s universal time .    in the present paper , we only discuss the contraction of @xmath0 spacetime which has a positive cosmological constant .",
    "all results are readily extended to the contraction of beltrami - anti - de sitter spacetime which has negative cosmological constant .",
    "as pointed out in sec . [ sect : bds ] and in @xcite , in the beltrami - de sitter spacetime @xmath3 the metric @xmath235 and its inverse @xmath236 are invariant under the fractional linear transformation ( [ g ] ) .",
    "consequently , the connection coefficients eq.([gamma ] ) and the components of the curvature tensor @xmath237 have the same property .",
    "since the coordinate transformation from one patch to another is a special case of the fractional linear transformation ( [ g ] ) , the forms of these quantities are the same in all the coordinate patches and the expressions of the geodesics have the same form in all the patches , too .",
    "the connection on @xmath3 is torsion free .",
    "the connection on @xmath2 is torsion free , too . since not a particular beltrami coordinate system is specified in obtaining eq.([cs ] ) from the contraction of coefficients of connection , eq.([cs ] ) should remain the same form under the nh transformations .",
    "in fact , we can define a new set of symbols @xmath238 among which only the following are nonzero : @xmath239 then it can be verified that @xmath128 and @xmath238 satisfy the standard transformation relation for coefficients of connection if @xmath240 is an nh transformation .",
    "so , the connection in @xmath2 is well defined .",
    "the nonzero components of the curvature tensor and ricci tensor calculated from eq.([cs ] ) are , respectively @xmath241 it follows that the mathematical forms of the curvature tensor and ricci tensor are also invariant under the nh transformation . and ,",
    "on the other hand , they can also be obtained by contracting the curvature tensor and ricci tensor on @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "finally , we re - study the deviation equation of geodesics in @xmath2 in terms of 4-d language .    given a timelike geodesic @xmath153 in @xmath2",
    ", we can construct a family of geodesics , @xmath242 @xmath243 , labeled by the parameter @xmath244 . for convenience",

    "it follows that , when @xmath246 , eq.([eq : der ] ) is an identity . when @xmath255 , it is equivalent to @xmath256",
    "we have seen that the result of the limit ( [ nu ] ) is not unique .",
    "in addition to eq.([nu ] ) , we need to specify the limits of the coordinates .",
    "we should have also noticed that the topological structure of contraction may not be the same as that of @xmath257 . here",
    ", we try to give a geometric point of view of the contraction .",
