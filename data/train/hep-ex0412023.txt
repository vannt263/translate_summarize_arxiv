    "when the @xmath0 lepton decays to 3 charged hadrons and a neutrino , the predominant decay mode involves three charged pions .",
    "occasionally this decay will include one , two or three kaons in the final state .",
    "each of these modes is useful for understanding different physics topics .",
    "the decay @xmath2 is important in extracting the strange spectral function as well the strange quark mass and the ckm matrix element @xmath3 .",
    "the decay @xmath4 allows one to probe the wess zumino term in the effective lagrangian . finally , the decay @xmath5 is as yet unobserved .    in this analysis",
    "we use a subset of almost 3 million @xmath0 pairs produced at the cesr @xmath6 collider at or near the @xmath7 resonance , analyzed with the cleo3  @xcite detector .",
    "since the predominant decay of the @xmath0 to 3 charged hadrons usually involves pions , we use the cleo3 rich detector to identify kaons with high efficiency while rejecting pion fakes .",
    "this is combined with the detector s @xmath8 capabilities to identify pions and kaons with efficiencies in the @xmath9 region and reject fakes at the @xmath10 level up to momenta of almost 2 gev / c .",
    "these efficiencies and fake rates are extracted from data using the decay chain @xmath11 . , and found that data and monte carlo estimations agreed . ]    at cleo near the @xmath7 resonance , @xmath0 s are produced back to back with substantial momentum .",
    "this allows us to select @xmath0 events by looking for events with 1 track recoiling against 3 tracks , with the event hemispheres identified using the event thrust axis .",
    "the single track hemisphere is required to be consistent with either a @xmath0 decay to an electron , muon , single pion , or @xmath12 with an unseen neutrino .",
    "events with extra showers are rejected to cut down on the feed - through from @xmath13 events .",
    "missing momentum and visible energy cuts reduce 2 photon fusion background events .",
    "also , events consistent with the production of a @xmath14 are rejected in the @xmath15 mode .",
    "events are simulated using koralb , jetset and geant , while particle identification efficiencies are taken from data as noted above .    .",
    "candidate event yields , estimated @xmath0 and @xmath16 backgrounds , and efficiencies for @xmath17 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table:2 ]    the substructure of this fit can be expressed in the context of our modified kuhn & mirkes model .",
    "the decay is found to be dominated by the @xmath18 mode , with approximately equal w - z and axial components .",
    "explicitly , @xmath19 these fractions do not add up to @xmath20 because of interference terms in the intermediate states .",
    "we extract the value of the branching fraction @xmath21 and this is found to be consistent with expectations from the cleo analysis for the decay @xmath22 .",
    "note that the axial component determined directly here is much smaller than that which has been found by aleph s cvc estimate ( @xmath23 )  @xcite using data from the dm1 and dm2 collaborations .",
    "note that our fit does have a floating value of @xmath24 which might contribute to the observed difference .",
    "this work has been published in  @xcite .",
    "in this talk , we have presented the first direct measurement of @xmath25 .",
    "we have also presented a measurement of @xmath26 consistent with previous work from opal and cleo , but higher than the result found by aleph .",
    "we ve set the most stringent limit on the branching fraction of the decay of a @xmath0 to 3 kaons and a neutrino , and have presented the best precision on @xmath27 .",
    "we have also presented the first study of the wz anomaly and the axial component of the decay @xmath28 .",
