    "as a liquid is cooled , its dynamics not only gets slower but also becomes increasingly heterogeneous @xcite . moreover , the characteristic size of regions with dynamics both significantly faster and significantly slower than the average dynamics grows upon cooling . this observation has led to the definition of a dynamic correlation length that measures the size of these so - called dynamic heterogeneneities .",
    "the dynamic correlation length was defined in terms of a four - point correlation function @xcite or a corresponding four - point structure factor @xcite .    while various four - point functions can readily be obtained from simulations ( albeit they typically require more computational effort than the familiar two - point functions ) , they are difficult to access experimentally . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "@xcite showed that derivatives of standard two - point functions with respect to thermodynamic variables like , _",

    "this opened a door to experimental investigations of the overall degree ( the strength ) of dynamic heterogeneity upon approaching the glass transition @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that berthier _",
    "_ could obtain the dynamic correlation length characterizing the spatial extent of dynamic heterogeneneities only by using additional assumptions that related the integrals of various three - point functions to characteristic length scales exhibited by these functions .",
    "while theoretical understanding of the derivatives of two - point functions with respect to thermodynamic variables is limited , biroli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the mode - coupling theory could be used to analyze a closely related quantity , a three - point susceptibility @xmath5 , which describes the change of the intermediate scattering function due to an inhomogeneous external potential .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it allows one to evaluate a characteristic length scale which , up to that time , had remained hidden within the well - known mode - coupling framework .",
    "this was possible due to the fact that biroli _",
    "_ considered a _",
    "non - uniform _ external perturbation rather than a uniform change of density or temperature .    to analyze the three - point susceptibility biroli _",
    "_ extended the standard mode - coupling theory to describe the time evolution of the intermediate scattering function of a system under the influence of an inhomogeneous external potential .",
    "they defined the three - point susceptibility @xmath5 as a derivative of the intermediate scattering function with respect to a fourier component of the external potential , @xmath6 .",
    "_ showed that upon approaching the mode - coupling transition both the @xmath3 limit of the three - point susceptibility and a characteristic length defined through the small @xmath0-dependence of @xmath5 diverge .",
    "moreover , they derived scaling predictions for the time - dependence of the characteristic length , and they found that this length grows as @xmath7 in the early @xmath8 regime ( here @xmath9 is the mode - coupling exponent describing approach of the intermediate scattering function to its plateau value ) and then saturates in the late @xmath8 and @xmath10 regimes .",
    "this was contrasted with the time dependence of the @xmath3 limit of the three - point susceptibility which grows as @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the early and late @xmath8 regimes , respectively ( here @xmath13 is the so - called von schweidler exponent of the mode - coupling theory describing departure of the intermediate scattering function from its plateau value ) , peaks around the @xmath10 relaxation time , and then decays to zero .",
    "the strikingly different time - dependence of the characteristic length and the @xmath3 limit of the three - point susceptibility was interpreted as an indication of changing fractal dimension of dynamic heterogeneities .",

    "_ derived only scaling predictions for the three - point susceptibility @xmath5 .",
    "they verified some of these predictions through a numerical analysis of a schematic model that completely disregards @xmath2 dependence .",
    "here we present a numerical investigation of the small @xmath0 behavior of the three - point susceptibility and the associated characteristic length .",
    "we focus on the time and @xmath2 dependence of the length , and on its dependence on the distance to the mode - coupling transition .",
