    "the two - dimensional spacetime @xmath0 called  trousers \" is obtained from the strip @xmath1\\ ] ] by , first , deleting the points @xmath2 and the ray @xmath3 , then attaching a copy of the deleted ray to either bank of the cut and , finally , smoothly gluing each of the six rays to its counterpart so that the resulting space consists of three cylinders , see figure  [ fig : space_1 ] .",
    ", the right leg @xmath4 , and the trunk @xmath5\\bigr)$ ] are obtained by gluing together the rays bounding the corresponding strips .",
    "the white circles depict the removed points . they can not be returned back after the relevant identifications are performed and thus a naked quasiregular singularity appears .",
    "[ fig : space_1 ] ]    the trousers spacetime merits the most detailed consideration because in spite of its simplicity it possesses two features , interesting and important , but poorly understood :    1 .",
    "the topology of its spacelike sections changes with time .",
    "it is @xmath6 at negative @xmath7 and @xmath8 at positive .",
    "this type of topology change is particularly significant , because it may have to do with the appearance of a wormhole or ( if the @xmath7-axis is directed to the past as in @xcite ) with the final stage of the wormholes ( including the schwarzschild black hole ) evaporation @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the spacetime is singular , as one might expect , and the singularity  loosely speaking it",
    "is located at the  crotch of the trousers\" is naked and quasiregular .",
    "presumably either of these properties makes it  unphysical \" , but no mechanism is found that would protect the universe from the appearance of such singularities .",
    "the evolution of a quantum field in trousers was first considered by anderson and dewitt ( ad ) . in their well - known paper",
    "@xcite they conjectured that the above - mentioned singularity emits an infinitely bright flash .",
    "their reasoning was as follows `` [  ] an ` in ' mode function propagating to the right splits into components propagating to the right in each leg .",
    "although continuous in the trunk region , such mode functions generally have discontinuities [  ] in the legs .",
    "[  ] every ` out ' mode function is continuous in each leg ( vanishing in one of them ) but has discontinuities in the trunk region .",
    "[  ] when these functions are differentiated the discontinuities give rise to delta functions .",
    "since the terms of the mode sum for @xmath9 are bilinear in differentiated mode functions , the square of the delta function automatically appears '' .",
    "the divergence of @xmath10 does not automatically exclude the topology changes : it may happen that _ some _ of them are free from that divergence @xcite or that the relevant quantity is the matrix element @xmath11 as opposed to the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the fields in such an unusual space must be quantized in some special way @xcite ( one such unusual quantization was proposed in @xcite , the resulting @xmath12 , though , diverges all the same ) .",
    "there is a good consensus , however , that the ad flashes are an indicator of some  flaw \" in the trousers spacetime @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that this is not the case .      in regard to the divergence of the energy density the trousers turn out to be as  nice \" as , say , the schwarzschild space .",
    "the latter is not compromised by the fact that in _ some _ states ( such as the boulware vacuum ) the energy density diverges at the horizon . what matters is the existence of states _ free _ of such divergences .",
    "accordingly , we rehabilitate the trousers spacetime by explicitly constructing a state in which @xmath13 are bounded .",
    "note that the existence of such a state does not contradict to the argument quoted above , owing to the word  generally \" used in the latter .",
    "the field @xmath14 considered in this paper obeys ( classically ) the wave equation @xmath15 though the spacetime under discussion is non - globally hyperbolic , the piecewise smooth ( see below ) complex - valued solutions of are fixed uniquely  this is proven in section  [ sec : reduc]by the data at any surface @xmath16 . in this sense",
    "the singularity is  harmless \" @xcite and we can ( and shall ) proceed exactly as in the globally hyperbolic case . in doing",
    "so we are guided by the textbook @xcite , in particular , the units and sign conventions are those used there .    to canonically quantize the field one must first expand it as a series in vacuum modes that is find a set of functions @xmath17 on @xmath18 that are an orthonormal basis in a hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "it is the choice of @xmath19 that encodes the physics of the problem and determines the resulting theory .    the field operator @xmath20 in qft is taken to be an ( operator - valued ) _ distribution_. but the hilbert space in discussion is usually built on the basis of _ smooth _ solutions of the classical equation of motion ( that is",
    ", @xmath21  may contain non - smooth functions , but only those to which a sequence of smooth ones converges ) .",
    "such a choice seems inadequate in studying  thunderbolts \" with their discontinuities .",
    "therefore manogue , copeland and dray in @xcite expanded the space by allowing the vacuum modes to have jumps . however , the derivatives of such modes will have @xmath22-like singularities exactly where the modes are discontinuous , which makes the klein  gordon scalar product ill - defined , see .",
    "physically such singularities seem unwarranted too . indeed , the crotch singularity can play the role of a source , so the solutions to the ( now inhomogeneous ) wave equation are expected to have irregularities on the null geodesics emanating from the  missing point \" .",
    "however , the energy density proportional to the square of the delta function is a _ too _ strong irregularity .",
    "so , in this paper we propose an intermediate approach and require classical solutions to be _ continuous _ , though not continuously differentiable .",
    "specifically , let @xmath23 be the space of bounded continuous complex - valued functions on @xmath18 that are smooth solutions to equation   on the whole @xmath24 except perhaps at the points of past incomplete inextendible null geodesics ( i.  e. , loosely speaking , null geodesics emanating from the singularity ) , where the derivatives of those functions may have jump discontinuities .",
    "correspondingly , we are looking for a space @xmath21  such that    1 .",
    "@xmath21  is a hilbert space with respect to the klein ",
    "gordon scalar product @xmath25 ( we indicate the particular value of @xmath7 because at this stage we can not guarantee that the integral does not depend on the choice of that value , the spacetime being non - globally hyperbolic ) .",
    "the positive - definiteness of this form is a non - trivial restriction on @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   up to a constant any function @xmath26 in @xmath23",
    "is the sum of a function from @xmath21and a function from  @xmath27 : @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are often called , respectively , `` positive and negative frequency '' parts of  @xmath26 .",
    "conversely , @xmath21  must not include  superfluous functions \" , in other words , @xmath21  must not have a proper subspace satisfying .",
    "remark[eq : arrow ] the word _",
    "past _ in the definition of @xmath31  signifies some time asymmetry in our approach which is not related to the asymmetry of the underlying spacetime .      in this subsection we represent in a convenient form the space @xmath31 : we use the periodicity of the functions constituting @xmath23 to express them in terms of their restrictions to the surface @xmath32 ( thus trading functions of two variables each for a pair of functions of one variable ) .    to begin with we note that any @xmath33 being a solution to the wave equation @xmath34 is the sum of a right - moving and a left - moving ( i.  e. depending  within each of the cylinders  on the @xmath35- or , respectively , @xmath36-coordinate of its argument ) function .",
