    "such calculations can be applied to estimate the ac losses in pancake coils wound from long lengths of second - generation ( 2 g ) high - temperature superconducting tapes.@xcite    recently noninductive coils with bifilar windings ( in which adjacent tapes carry current in _ opposite _ directions ) have been fabricated using 2 g superconducting tapes for use in superconducting fault - current limiters ( scfcls).@xcite references and give excellent reviews of this topic .",
    "each tape consists of a superconducting film of the order of 1 @xmath7 m in thickness and 1 cm in width .",
    "a thin insulating buffer layer separates the film from the underlying metallic base , which is typically tens of @xmath7 m in thickness . usually surrounding this structure is a normal - metal ( e.g. , copper ) stabilizer , such that the total tape thickness is a fraction of 1 mm .",
    "accounting for the thickness of the insulation between tapes , the spacing @xmath2 between the superconducting films in adjacent tapes is of the order of a few mm .",
    "since the interleaving tapes in such coils carry current in opposite directions , the current - generated magnetic fields are localized within the windings and decay very rapidly outside the coil .    to determine the current distribution within a bifilar stack of superconducting strips is not trivial . roughly speaking , when a strip carries an increasing current , the current density just slightly exceeds the the critical current density @xmath4 only at the strip edges , where vortices penetrate and carry perpendicular magnetic flux through the strip .",
    "the middle portions carry a current density less than @xmath4 , and therefore no perpendicular magnetic flux penetrates the strip there .",

    "i give a brief summary and discuss the results in sec .",
    "as in many earlier calculations of the properties of thin - film superconductors , i consider only high-@xmath8 type - ii superconductors and assume for simplicity that the magnitude of the self - field @xmath9 at the film edges or top and bottom surfaces is typically much larger than @xmath10 , such that the magnetic induction in the superconducting film is given to good approximation by @xmath11 . for small currents",

    "<S> in this paper i first analytically calculate the magnetic - field and sheet - current distributions generated in an infinite stack of thin superconducting strips of thickness @xmath0 , width @xmath1 and arbitrary separation @xmath2 when adjacent strips carry net current of magnitude @xmath3 in opposite directions . each strip </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to have uniform critical current density @xmath4 , critical sheet - current density @xmath5 , and critical current @xmath6 , and the distribution of the current density within each strip is assumed to obey critical - state theory . </S>",
    "<S> i then derive expressions for the ac losses due to magnetic - flux penetration both from the strip edges and from the top and bottom of each strip , and i express the results in terms of integrals involving the perpendicular and parallel components of the magnetic field . after numerically evaluating the ac losses for typical dimensions , i present analytic expressions from which the losses can be estimated . </S>"
