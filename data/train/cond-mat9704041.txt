    "the behavior of diluted ising antiferromagnets in a homogeneous field ( daff ) and of random field ising ferromagnets ( rfim ) is still not well understood ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "although it has been argued that daff and rfim belong to the same universality classes @xcite recent results @xcite suggest that there might be essential differences .    in @xcite integer optimization algorithms where applied to the rfim in order to calculate exact ground states at fixed fields in polynomial time . in @xcite",
    "different degenerated ground states of daffs and rfims were calculated by using a simple extension of these optimization methods .",
    "the invention of new fast algorithms @xcite inspired us to develop an algorithm which calculates the ground states for all fields and is presented in this paper .",
    "additionally the complete degenerated structure of a ground state is computable at once , by the use of some more complex algorithms from graph theory @xcite . applying these methods",
    "a far better insight into the nature of ground states of disordered systems is possible .",
    "all systems we investigated were cubic @xmath5 lattices of ising spins @xmath6 with periodic boundary conditions . for a daff",
    "each lattice site is occupied ( @xmath7 ) with probability @xmath8 ( otherwise @xmath9 ) .",
    "the daff is described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath10    with the uniform external field @xmath11 and the interaction constant @xmath12 .",
    "the sum @xmath13 runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors . for low temperatures and small fields @xmath14",
    "the daff has an antiferromagnetic phase . in this paper",
    "we show for the critical field @xmath15 . for finite fields and low temperatures",
    "exists a frozen domain state which is characterized by fractal domains @xcite . for higher fields or higher temperatures",
    "the daff is paramagnetic .",
    "the hamiltonian for the rfim is @xmath16    all sites ore occupied , but the magnetic fields @xmath17 are site dependent and distributed according a bimodal ( @xmath18-rfim ) or a gaussian ( gaussian - rfim ) probability distribution .",
    "their probability density functions are    @xmath19    like the daff the 3d rfim has a long range ordered low temperature and low field phase , a disordered phase for finite fields ( critical field : @xmath20 @xcite ) and is paramagnetic for high temperatures or high fields .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the first section explains how all degenerated ground states of a system at a fixed field value can be represented by a relation of clusters .",
    "the second section gives an algorithm which calculates the ground states for all fields . in the third section",
    "we show the results of our calculations .",
    "we present the order parameter for sample systems of different sizes , estimate the values for the critical fields , analyze how the number of jumps increases with increasing system size and investigate the degree of degeneracy as function of field and size . in the last section",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "we used well known algorithms from graph theory @xcite to calculate the ground state of a system at given field @xmath2 and interaction constant @xmath21 .",
    "all quantities @xmath22 have to be integer - valued .",
    "the calculation works by transforming the system into a network @xcite , and calculating the maximum flow @xcite . with level(@xmath23 ) = level(@xmath24)+1 , but also all edges @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sink . for this measure",
    ", we observed an additional speed - up of roughly factor 2 for the systems we calculated . ] all degenerated ground states of the system are given @xcite by a set @xmath27 of clusters , and a binary relation @xmath28 defined on @xmath29 .",
    "each cluster @xmath30 is a set of antiferromegnetically ( daff ) resp .",
    "ferromagnetically ( rfim ) ordered spins .",
    "these spins are not necessarily spatial connected .    from the pair @xmath31 a ground state",
    "is calculated in the following way .",
    "each cluster @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is assigned a _ orientation _ ( or _ sign _ ) @xmath34 :    the signs of the clusters @xmath35 are determined : @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "for all other clusters @xmath32 ( @xmath38 ) , called _ inner clusters _ , the sign can be chosen free ( @xmath39 ) under consideration of the condition ( @xmath40 ) :    @xmath41    i.e. , if a cluster has the sign @xmath42 , then all successors in the relation @xmath28 must have the sign @xmath42 too .    from the signs of the clusters the spin states of the spins @xmath43",
    "are calculated by    @xmath44    the function @xmath45 divides the lattice of the daff into two sublattices : @xmath46 for a spin @xmath47 with coordinates @xmath48 .",
    "so the clusters @xmath35 consist of the spins with fixed states , for each direction one cluster , all other clusters contain spins which contribute to the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "the dependencies between spins of adjacent clusters are given by the relation @xmath28    as example we consider an one dimensional rfim chain with open ends consisting of four spins @xmath49 .",
    "the random fields are @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "so the states of the end - spins are fixed in the ground state @xmath52 .",
    "the states of the inner spins are not fixed .",
    "the system is visualized in figure [ example_sys ] .",
    "the energy of the system as function of the two inner spins is @xmath53 .",
    "the energies for the four possible states are shown in the following table .    [ cols=\">,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_num_samples ]    for the @xmath54 samples we reduced the @xmath55-interval to @xmath56 $ ] . for the @xmath57 gaussian - rfim we reduced the @xmath58-interval to @xmath59 $ ] .    in figure",
    "[ p_af08 ] the antiferromagnetic order parameter per spin    @xmath60    of two daff systems with @xmath61 and @xmath62 over the whole range @xmath63 $ ] is displayed .",
    "because of the ground state degeneracy many states are possible . here",
    "the two extreme values , the order parameter can take , are shown .",
    "for the small system for @xmath64 two states are possible , because its total magnetization is zero .",
    "the larger system has this feature only for @xmath65 . for both systems",
    "the range of possible @xmath66-values is relatively small for @xmath67 and little bit larger for @xmath68 .",
    "the range is the largest for integer values @xmath69 of @xmath55 , because spins having neighbors with total magnetization @xmath69 can take both orientations .",
    "the main differences between the two systems are : the larger system exhibits more jumps and the order parameter decreases more quicker than for @xmath61 .",
    "the discrete structure is clearly visible . in both systems",
    "the order parameter is high for small fields and goes stepwise to zero .",
    "because of the step - structure it is difficult to obtain critical magnetic fields by calculation of susceptibilities and then use finite size scaling to go to the @xmath70 limit .",
    "instead we proceed as follows , to get first informations about how the order parameter changes .",
    "we calculated for each sample the _ barrier field value _ @xmath71 where the order parameter @xmath66 falls the first time below @xmath72 , i.e.    @xmath73    in figure [ p_af_unter ] the average @xmath74 is plotted against the inverse system size @xmath75 for @xmath76 . just to get a first impression we extrapolated to @xmath70 by fitting straight lines @xmath77 .",
    "the fit seems to be good , but may have no physical meaning . from the figure we can see that @xmath78 , so the transition to the domain state occurs for @xmath79 !",
    "this is in contradiction to previous results from mc calculations of systems of size 60x60x61 @xcite where @xmath80 was found .",
    "because we want to rule out the influence of the fit function , we checked the result by calculating the ground states for ten @xmath81 systems , at @xmath82 where we got an average order parameters of @xmath83 .",
    "so the infinite system has no long range order for @xmath84 ! from figure [ p_af_unter ]",
    "we ca nt see , whether the @xmath85 $ ] interval remains finite or becomes infinitely small for the @xmath86 system .",
    "more calculations and larger systems are needed .    in figure [ p_rf08 ]",
    "diagrams are shown for the magnetization per spin    @xmath87    of two sample @xmath88-rfim .",
    "the impression is similar to the daff , but the order parameter goes to zero at higher fields and there are more jumps in the system because there are more spins in a rfim than in a daff of the same size @xmath89 .",
    "diagrams of gaussian - rfim look similar but there are even more jumps in a system of equal size and the decrease of the order parameter is less rapid .    in analogy to the daff we calculated the barrier fields @xmath90 for the random field systems .",
    "they are display in figure [ p_rf_unter ]    we got the values @xmath91 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath92 ( gaussian ) for the infinite systems .",
    "the value for the @xmath18 system is consistent with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "for the gaussian - rfim the values are less reliable , because we could calculate only few systems .",
    "the gaussian systems exhibit many jumps and the number of ground states which have to be calculated is about six times the number of jumps . so many ground states have to be calculate to analyze the system , resulting in more computer time needed .",
    "for all types of systems the number of jumps @xmath93 increases with system size .",
    "figure [ p_numjumps_l ] shows this dependence .",
    "the number of jumps increases roughly like @xmath94 with @xmath95 ( daff ) , @xmath96 ( @xmath18-rfim ) , @xmath97 ( gaussian - rfim , only jumps in @xmath98 $ ] are counted , the number of jumps in [ 0.0,6.0 ] is about four times higher ! )",
    "this means that the behavior of the system gets smoother with increasing size , i.e. the infinite system looses the discrete structure on finite @xmath2-scales .",
    "we measured also the number of jumps in the @xmath2-interval where the order parameter falls from 0.8 to 0.2 for each system .",
    "even this number increases although the interval is reduced with increasing system size .",
    "we performed a similar fit to the case above and obtained @xmath99 ( daff ) , @xmath100 ( @xmath18-rfim ) and @xmath101 ( gaussian - rfim ) .    in the last part we focus on the degree of degeneration ( dod ) . in figure [ p_af_degdeg ] the dod of the sample daff systems",
    "is displayed as function of the field @xmath55 .",
    "the dod is not calculated exactly , but estimated very accurately by an algorithm found in @xcite .",
    "the degree of degeneracy is there very large , where the external field takes integer values . for non",
    "integer values the dod takes the largest values for @xmath102 .",
    "we found that there are only small connected subgraphs in @xmath103 of small height ( the maximum length path in the graph ) at fields @xmath55 where no jump occurs .",
    "so the spin - clusters contributing to the degeneracy are flipping almost independently , i.e. the ground state structure is quite simple .",
    "that means that the number of states are not reduced very much from @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of inner clusters .",
    "we could find that the average dod can be approximated very good by a function of @xmath105 and of the number of edges @xmath106 in @xmath103 over the full @xmath55-range :    @xmath107    this means , that for @xmath108 all inner clusters are independent , so the dod depends exponential on the number of nodes .",
    "the edges put constraints on the nodes , so the number of possible states is reduced .",
    "so it is possible to describe the ground state structure by a single value @xmath109 .",
    "we measured @xmath110 .",
    "this value is quite independent of the system size and the external field - values has a peak at @xmath111 .",
    "that is the value of a system consisting only of independent clusters and of pairs of clusters each connected by one edge . ] .",
    "figure [ p_rf_degdeg ] shows the dod for the two sample @xmath88-rfim systems . here",
    "the dod takes its largest values at the integer - fields @xmath112 and in @xmath113 . for the gaussian - rfim",
    "_ no degeneration _ occurs except the twofold degeneration at the jumps .",
    "this is to be expected , because it is very unlikely that the sum of the random fields @xmath114 is zero for a cluster @xmath115 .",
    "the dod of the @xmath18-rfim can also be approximated very well by equation ( [ dod_formula ] ) .",
    "we got an average @xmath116 .    since the dod",
    "is mainly determined by the number @xmath105 of ( inner ) clusters and the number @xmath106 of edges , we calculated these values for the daff/@xmath18-rfim at @xmath117 for sizes up to @xmath81 ( from 2560 realizations for @xmath118 to 10 realizations for the largest systems ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ p_num_xxx ] .",
    "for both system types all numbers have a @xmath119 dependence on @xmath89 .",
    "the number of edges is about 3 to four times smaller than the number of clusters .",
    "for the daff about @xmath120 percent of the spins are contained in the inner clusters , for the @xmath18-rfim this value is only 1.8 percent .",
    "these values are almost independent of the system size .",
    "because the number of clusters / state depend linearly on the system size , this shows again that the ground state of the daff / rfim consist of many independent small clusters .",
    "so the number of clusters increases , but not the size of the clusters and not the degree of connection between the clusters .",
    "this means that the degree of degeneracy depends exponential on the size of the system .",
    "in this paper we have presented an algorithm for calculating exact ground states of random field systems and diluted antiferromagnets in polynomial time for all fields @xmath2 .",
    "the complete degeneracy of all states is representable by a relation of ( anti-)ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "the use of new fast algorithm allowed us to calculate systems of sizes up to @xmath4 .",
    "we found that the transition to the domain states occurs for the daff at @xmath79 in contradiction to previous results . the result for",
    "the @xmath18-rfim @xmath121 was consistent with previous calculations .",
    "for the gaussian rfim we found @xmath122 .",
    "the order parameters of the systems are stepwise constant functions of the field .",
    "the number of jumps inside a given @xmath2 interval increases faster than @xmath89 , indicating that the infinite system has a rather smooth behavior .",
    "the ground state degeneracy of the daff and the @xmath18-rfim is very high , especially when the field is integer valued .",
    "apart from these values the degree of degeneracy is at highest in the domain state .",
    "the degree of degeneracy increases exponentially with system size .",
    "the degeneration is rather simple , because the ground states consist of many small , only loosely coupled clusters . not more than 5 resp",
    ".  2 percent of all spins contribute to the degeneracy .",
    "the gaussian - rfim is not degenerated at all , except at the jump fields , where one cluster can take two orientations .    using the methods presented and referenced in this paper many more information about the ground state structure of daffs and rfims",
    "will be obtained in the future . a detailed analysis of the numbers , sizes and forms of the clusters forming the ground states and type of connections between them is possible .",
    "because the systems get smoother with increasing size , finite size scaling techniques should be applicable , to gain more insight into the transition from the long range order to the domain state .",
