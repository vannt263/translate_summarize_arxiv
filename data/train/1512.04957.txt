    "the gaseous halo of the milky way is home to a diverse population of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) that do not co - rotate with the underlying disk .",

    "once the neutral and ionized phases of hvcs are accounted for , they represent a global inflow rate onto the galaxy of @xmath00.41.4m@xmath6yr@xmath2   ( shull et al .",

    "the smith cloud ( sc ; see figure 1 ; smith 1963 ) , also known as the galactic - center - positive ( gcp ) complex , is a large hvc plunging toward the galactic plane with a velocity @xmath7=73kms@xmath2 , an  mass of @xmath810@xmath9@xmath10   ( lockman et al .",

    "the sc has a heliocentric distance of @xmath11=12.4@xmath11.3kpc , based on three independent methods : the detection of absorption lines in background stellar spectra ( wakker et al .",
    "2008 ) , its kinematics ( lockman et al . 2008 ) , and its h@xmath12 emission ( putman et al . 2003 ) .",

    "it is unclear whether it represents galactic material , expelled from the disk as part of a galactic fountain ( bregman 1980 ) , accreting extragalactic material , the gaseous remnant of a dwarf galaxy , such as the sagittarius dwarf ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1998 ) or other satellite ( stark et al . 2015 ) , or something else . the key missing piece of evidence is the sc metallicity .",
    "metallicity discriminates between recycled galactic gas ( enriched ) and infalling extragalactic gas ( unenriched ) , but since the sc lies close to the disk and so has relatively high foreground extinction , there have been ( until now ) no agn lying behind the sc observed in the uv .",

    "however , the variation in abundance across the sc may be real . indeed , the direction with the lowest derived abundance ( toward , where [ s / h ] is @xmath00.5dex lower than in the other two sightlines ) is the sightline furthest into the sc wake , where more metal mixing with the surrounding gas is expected to occur @xcite .",

    "the n abundance in the @xmath2610@xmath38k ionized gas in the leading edge of the sc is 0.150.44 solar , as derived from optical [ ] emission lines and assuming the ionized gas is photoionized ( although shocks may play a role there ; hill et al 2009 , 2013 ) . in a downstream portion of the cloud , more analogous to the sightlines probed in this work , the derived n abundance is 0.30.8 solar ( putman et al 2003 , hill et al 2013 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the sc has a solar or sub - solar n/@xmath12 ratio .",
    "the sc directly addresses a question of broad general interest : how does gas get into galaxies ?",
    "since the sc is a coherent  cloud that has survived to its current location without breaking apart , it clearly exemplifies one pathway to bring fuel into galaxies .",
    "the question is what is the origin of that pathway ?",
    "our measurement of a high metallicity ( 0.53@xmath5 solar ) argues in favor of a galactic origin for the sc , such as gas on the returning leg of a fountain ( bregman 1980 ) launched into the halo at a different location in the disk ( sofue et al .",
    "2004 ) . given the galactic radial chemical abundance gradient of @xmath40.06dexkpc@xmath2 @xcite , half - solar metallicity is reached at a galactocentric radius of 13 kpc , which is exactly where the last sc disk passage occurred in the lockman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) trajectory .",
    "_ therefore the metallicity and orbit of the smith cloud are both consistent with an origin in the outer disk .",
    "_    if the sc was accreting for the first time from the igm , or is the remnant ism of a dwarf galaxy ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1998 ) , it would have a lower metallicity .",
    "the lmc has @xmath00.50 solar metallicity , but is orders of magnitude more massive than the sc , and all other local group dwarfs have lower metallicity .",
    "stark et al . ( 2013 ) noted how the newly discovered star - forming galaxy leo p has similar properties to the sc , and would also not show stars if at the sc s location .",
    "however , leo p has a metallicity of 3% solar @xcite .",
    "our sc metallicity conclusively rules out such a galaxy as the cloud s origin .",
    "our abundance calculations have not taken into account the depletion of sulfur onto dust grains @xcite . however",
    ", any such depletion would _ raise _ the total ( gas+dust ) inferred sulfur abundance , strengthening the conclusion that the sc is galactic .",
    "furthermore , if any metal mixing has occurred in the cloud s past , so that it represents a diluted mixture of galactic and extragalactic material , the fact that the resulting metallicity is as high as @xmath0half solar again strengthens the idea that galactic ( enriched ) gas contributed to its origin ( see bland - hawthorn et al . 2015 and webster et al .",
    "2015 for recent arguments concerning metal mixing ) .",
    "it has long been a mystery how the sc survived to reach its current location , because infalling hvcs are predicted and observed to be disrupted by their interaction with the surrounding gaseous medium .",
    "the lifetime against disruption depends on the clouds mass @xcite and density contrast with the external medium @xcite .",
    "one possibility , explored by @xcite and @xcite , is that the sc might be a dark galaxy , bearing dark matter and gas but no stars .",
    "the dark matter would provide the confinement that allowed the cloud to survive the @xmath070 myr since its last disk passage .",
    "our detection of metals argues against this idea , since the metals require star formation to have occurred .",
    "another possibility to consider is whether the sc is a dark matter halo that accreted sufficient disk material on a previous passage to explain its high metallicity . using the disk column of @xcite and the cloud s trajectory",
    ", the sc would travel through an ism mass of @xmath39@xmath10during a single pass through the disk , which is @xmath010% of the sc mass for a projected radius @xmath40=100pc .",
    "however , this assumes that the cloud incorporates _ all _ of the gas mass it travels through , which is unrealistic .",
    "simulations show that the accretion efficiencies are @xmath00.11% , depending on the time and velocity ( f. heitsch et al .",
    "2016 , in prep . ) , making it challenging for this scenario to explain our metallicity observations .",
    "although our sulfur abundance is supportive of a galactic origin for the sc , there remain two main hurdles for this hypothesis : the cloud s mass and kinematics .",
    "the mass problem is that the sc s high mass ( @xmath02@xmath4110@xmath9@xmath10 ) is much larger than that of known extraplanar galactic  clouds , such as superbubble `` caps '' , and makes it unlikely that any star - formation process in the disk is energetic enough to explain the sc @xcite . for example",
    ", the cap to the ophiuchus superbubble contains only @xmath03@xmath4110@xmath38@xmath10  of  @xcite .",
    "however , recent theoretical work on galactic fountains has shown they can sweep up and cool coronal gas @xcite . in such models",
    "the mass of fountain hvcs grows with time as they accrete cooled coronal material . in the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite , an hvc can increase its mass by a factor of three in 200 myr",
    "the mass problem would be alleviated by such a mechanism , because then the current sc mass would be higher than its launch mass and so the required launch energy would be lower than previously thought .",
    "the second problem is the sc s kinematics .",
    "there is direct evidence in the gbt  data that the cloud has a line - of - sight velocity at least 70kms@xmath2  greater than the galactic halo material it is encountering @xcite .",
    "the sc orbit is prograde and inclined at a shallow angle relative to the milky way disk ( @xmath030 ) .",
    "this indicates that the cloud is moving faster than galactic rotation , and such super - rotation is not commonly observed : in other galaxies a _ lag _ in rotation of gaseous material thrown up above the plane is typically seen @xcite .",
    "a super - rotating extraplanar cloud would be unique .    in conclusion",
    ", our sulfur abundance of 0.53@xmath5 solar for the sc provides an important new clue on its origin and supports a galactic ( as opposed to extragalactic ) explanation , effectively ruling out dwarf - galaxy and dark - galaxy origins .",
    "however , the cloud s mass and kinematics require it to be a highly unusual galactic cloud . this enigmatic object is still to be fully explained .",
    "the authors are grateful to robin shelton , ken croswell , and the referee for valuable comments .",
