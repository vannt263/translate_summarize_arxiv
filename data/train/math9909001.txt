    "non standard ( or jordanian ) deformations of lie groups and lie algebras has been a subject of considerable interest in the mathematical physics community .",
    "jordanian deformations for @xmath5 were introduced in [ 1,2 ] , its two parametric generalisation given in [ 3 ] and extended to the supersymmetric case in [ 4 ] .",
    "non standard deformations of @xmath6 ( i.e. at the algebra level ) were first proposed in [ 5 ] , the universal @xmath7-matrix presented in [ 6 - 8 ] and irreducible representations studied in [ 9,10 ] .",
    "a peculiar feature of this deformation ( also known as @xmath8-deformation ) is that the corresponding @xmath7-matrix is triangular .",
    "it was shown in [ 11 ] that up to isomorphism , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the only possible distinct deformations ( with central determinant ) of the group @xmath5 . in [ 12 ] , an interesting observation was made that the @xmath8-deformation could be obtained by a singular limit of a similarity transformation from the @xmath4-deformations of the group @xmath5 .",
    "given this contraction procedure , it would be useful to look for jordanian deformations of other @xmath4-groups .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our attention on a particular two parameter quantum group , denoted @xmath11 , which provides a realisation of the well known @xmath12 .",
    "we investigate the contraction procedure on @xmath11 , in order to obtain its non standard counterpart .",
    "the generators of the contracted structure are employed to realise the two parameter non standard @xmath13 .",
    "this is similar to what happens in the @xmath4-deformed case .",
    "the two parameter quantum group @xmath11 is generated by elements @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 satisfying the relations @xmath19=(\\rinv - r)bc \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath20 elements @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 satisfying the first set of commutation relations form a subalgebra which coincides exactly with @xmath9 when @xmath21 .",
    "the matrix of generators is @xmath22 and the hopf structure is given as @xmath23 the casimir operator is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "the inverse is assumed to exist and satisfies @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , which enables determination of the antipode matrix @xmath28 , as @xmath29 the quantum determinant @xmath30 is group - like but not central .",
    "the quantum group @xmath11 was proposed in [ 13 ] as a particular quotient of the multiparameter @xmath4-deformation of @xmath31 .",
    "the structure of @xmath11 is interesting because it contains the one parameter @xmath4-deformation of @xmath5 as a hopf subalgebra and also gives a simple realisation of the quantum group @xmath12 in terms of the generators of @xmath11 .",
    "there is a hopf algebra morphism @xmath32 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 given by @xmath33 @xmath34    the elements @xmath35,@xmath36,@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the generators of @xmath12 and @xmath39 is a fixed non - zero integer .",
    "the relation between the deformation parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 is given by @xmath42    this quantum group can , therefore , be used to realise both @xmath9 and @xmath12 quantum groups .",
    "the @xmath7- matrix of @xmath11 explicitly reads    @xmath43    with entries labelled in the usual numerical order @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "if we reorder the indices of this @xmath7-matrix with the elements in the order @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , then we obtain a block matrix , say @xmath53 which is similar to the form of the @xmath9 @xmath7-matrix with the @xmath4 in the @xmath54 position itself replaced by the @xmath9 @xmath7-matrix .",
    "@xmath55    where @xmath56 is the @xmath57 @xmath7-matrix for @xmath9 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the @xmath61 identity matrix and @xmath62 is the @xmath61 matrix @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the deformation parameters .",
    "the zeroes are the zero matrices of appropriate order .",
    "the usual block structure of the @xmath7-matrix is clearly visible in this form .",
    "it is well known [ 12 ] that the non standard @xmath7-matrix @xmath66 can be obtained from the @xmath4-deformed @xmath67 as a singular limit of a similarity transformation @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "such a transformation has been generalised to higher dimensions [ 14 ] and has also been successfully applied to two parameter quantum groups . here",
    "we apply the above transformation for the @xmath11 quantum group .",
    "our starting point is the block diagonal form of the @xmath11 @xmath7-matrix , denoted @xmath53 @xmath70 where @xmath59 .",
    "we apply to @xmath53 the transformation @xmath71 here the transformation matrix @xmath72 is a @xmath73 matrix and chosen in the block diagonal form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the transformation matrix for the two dimensional case . substituting @xmath76 and then taking the singular limit @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( such that @xmath79 ) yields the jordanian @xmath7-matrix @xmath80 where the entries are labelled in the block diagonal form @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this @xmath7-matrix is triangular and a solution of the quantum yang baxter equation @xmath81 it is interesting to note that the block diagonal form of @xmath82 embeds the @xmath7-matrix for the single parameter deformed @xmath10 for @xmath83 .",
    "a two parameter jordanian quantum group , denoted @xmath84 , can be formed by using the contracted @xmath7-matrix @xmath82 in conjunction with a @xmath85-matrix of the form @xmath22 the @xmath86- relations give the commutation relations between the generators @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath87 = mc^{2 } , & \\qquad & [ c , b ] = m(ac+cd ) = m(ca+dc)\\\\ & [ c , a ] = mc^{2 } , & \\qquad & [ d , a ] = m(d - a)c = mc(d - a ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath88 = m(d^{2}-d)\\ ] ] @xmath89 = m(d - a^{2})\\ ] ] and @xmath90 = kcf , \\qquad & [ f , b ] = k(df - fa)\\\\ & [ f , c ] = 0 , \\qquad & [ f , d ] = -kcf \\end{array}\\ ] ] the element @xmath91 is central in the whole algebra . the coalgebra structure of @xmath84 can be written as @xmath23 adjoining the element @xmath92 to the algebra enables determination of the antipode matrix @xmath28 , @xmath93 ( the hopf structure of @xmath92 is @xmath94 . )",
    "it is evident that the elements @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath84 form a hopf subalgebra which coincides with non standard @xmath5 with deformation parameter @xmath95 .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the @xmath4-deformed case where the first four elements of @xmath11 form the @xmath9 hopf subalgebra .",
    "again , the remaining fifth element @xmath18 generates the @xmath96 group , as it did in the @xmath4-deformed case , and the second parameter appears only through the cross commutation relations between @xmath97 and @xmath96 elements .",
    "therefore , @xmath84 can also be considered as a two parameter jordanian deformation of classical @xmath98 group .",
    "now we wish to explore the connection of @xmath84 with the two parameter jordanian @xmath13 .",
    "a hopf algebra morphism @xmath99 of exactly the same form as in the @xmath4-deformed case , exists between the generators of @xmath84 and @xmath13 provided that the two sets of deformation parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 are related via the equation @xmath102 note that for vanishing @xmath103 , one gets the one parameter case .",
    "in addition , using the above realisation together with the coproduct , counit and antipode axioms for the @xmath84 algebra and the respective homeomorphism properties , one can easily recover the standard coproduct , counit and antipode for @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the non standard @xmath13 group can in fact be reproduced from the newly defined non standard @xmath84 .",
    "it is curious to note that if we write @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , then the relations between the parameters in the @xmath4-deformed case and the @xmath8-deformed case are identical .",
    "we have applied the contraction procedure to the @xmath11 quantum group and obtained a new jordanian quantum group @xmath84 .",
    "the group @xmath84 has five generators and two deformation parameters and contains the single parameter @xmath10 as a hopf subalgebra .",
    "furthermore , we have given a realisation of the two parameter @xmath13 through the generators of @xmath84 which also reproduces its full hopf algebra structure .",
    "the results match with the @xmath4-deformed case .",
