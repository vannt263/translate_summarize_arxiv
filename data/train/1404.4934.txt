    "whether majorana fermions exist in real world keeps an unsolved problem since they were first proposed  @xcite more than seventy years ago .",
    "recently the many - body systems become the important candidates for hosting majorana fermions  @xcite which may exist there as collective excitations .",
    "several solid state and cold atomic systems have been proposed  @xcite , e.g. , the topological superconductors  @xcite , while the detection of majorana fermions keeps a challenge .",
    "a promising way is by the transport properties of majorana edge states , i.e. , a quantized conductance at zero temperature at the junction of the system and a normal metal  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on quantum wires  @xcite reported the observation of zero bias peaks in tunneling conductances at finite temperatures , but did not provide the exclusive evidence of majorana fermions , because the impurities in the materials may cause similar peaks  @xcite .",
    "the floquet topological theory provides a new approach of making majorana fermions dynamically .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite extended the definition of topological order from equilibrium states to periodically driven states by floquet theory .",
    "based on this definition , some authors  @xcite predicted the floquet topological superconductor ( superfluid ) , which host majorana fermions at their edges . and these floquet majorana fermions have the same non - abelian statistics as their equilibrium counterparts  @xcite .    concerning the floquet majorana fermions , much less",
    "is known about their detection . a quantized conductance signals the majorana fermions in equilibrium topological superconductors .",
    "however , the floquet topological superconductor is in a time - periodic nonequilibrium state , in which a ( quasi)particle may change its energy by absorbing or releasing photons .",
    "the lack of a conserved quasiparticle energy modifies the transport process .",
    "the resonant tunneling is accompanied by the photon - assisted tunneling , so that the linear conductance is not quantized any more even at zero temperature .",
    "kundu and seradjeh  @xcite derived a sum rule for linear conductances , but it is difficult to measure in experiments .",
    "further studies on the transport properties of floquet topological superconductors are still necessary .    on the other hand , incommensurate potential was recently employed for studying the effect of disorder on the transport properties of topological superconductors due to its good controllability .",
    "the incommensurate potential has been experimentally engineered in cold atomic systems  @xcite , and its generation in solid state systems was also under discussion  @xcite .",
    "studies on the kitaev s p - wave model with incommensurate potentials  @xcite predicted a topological phase transition from the topological superconducting phase to the anderson localized phase as the disorder strength increases .",
    "and the tunneling conductance shows a jump at the critical point  @xcite .",
    "this jump belongs to the non - analytic behaviors at an equilibrium phase transition .",
    "similarly , we expect the non - analytic behavior of conductances in a time - periodically driven system , when it experiences a nonequilibrium phase transition by tuning the driving field  @xcite .",
    "this non - analytic behavior provides a possible way of detecting majorana fermions since the direct observation of a quantized conductance is still impossible .",
    "it is then worth of studying the evolution of conductances with changing driving field .",
    "therefore , we study the tunneling conductance of the kitaev s p - wave model with time - periodic incommensurate potentials in this paper . by choosing appropriate parameters , we find that this system is in the floquet topological superconducting phase in the weak driving regime , but experiences phase transition to a floquet topologically trivial phase as the driving strength increases .",
    "the conductance of floquet topological superconductors drops to zero at the transition , being a continuous but non - smooth function . and the zero conductance is accompanied by the vanishing of majorana edge states .",
    "our findings contribute to the problem of detecting floquet majorana fermions by showing the details of the non - analytic behavior of conductances at the transition .",
    "the transport properties of a driven quantum system are usually studied by the floquet green s function method  @xcite .",
    "while considering that the current is time - dependent in our system , we develop the recently introduced numerical operator method  @xcite for our calculations .",
    "our method gives not only averaged conductances , but also the real time dynamics of currents in one period .",
    "the latter is absent in previous studies .",
    "we then provide a complete description of the transport properties of floquet topological superconductors including their time - dependent characteristics .",

    "the system experiences a topological phase transition at @xmath8 and is driven into the anderson localized phase in the presence of strong disorder  @xcite .",

    "since a topological phase transition happens at @xmath27 in the hamiltonian @xmath21 , we deduce that the driven system experiences phase transition at @xmath28 once the disorder strength satisfies @xmath29 .",
    "the system is in the anderson localized phase for @xmath30 and in the topological superconducting phase for @xmath31 .    a particularly interesting result of eq .  ( [ besselcondition ] )",
    "is got from the oscillation of the bessel function in @xmath32 . if @xmath33 is sufficiently small , the system is in the topological superconducting phase at @xmath34 . by increasing the driving strength , we get the topologically trivial phase .",
    "but when further increasing @xmath10 , we resurrect the topological superconducting phase ( see the top right panel of fig .  [",

    "the oscillation of @xmath32 results in the alternate disappearance and appearance of majorana fermions . from the shape of the function @xmath35 , it is easy to see that the existence of multiple transitions as @xmath10 increasing is only possible if @xmath6 is close to @xmath36 .",
    "the qualitative analysis requires the driving frequency being much larger than the other energy scales , i.e. , @xmath37 .",

    "the floquet topological superconducting state hosts majorana fermions , but the localized state does not . our findings then show that the floquet majorana fermions do not lead to a quantized conductance .",

    "in summary , the transport properties of a floquet topological superconducting state is very different from that of a static topological superconducting state .",
    "the periodic current has a strong oscillation in course of time , and the amplitude of oscillation may even be larger than the average of current . the average of current is nonzero even at the zero voltage bias due to the pumping effect . and the linear conductance is not quantized , but changes continuously as the driving strength varies .",

    "<S> the floquet topological superconducting state is a nonequilibrium time - periodic state hosting majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we study its transport properties by using the kitaev model with time - periodic incommensurate potentials , which experiences phase transition from the floquet topological superconducting phase to the anderson localized phase with increasing driving strength . </S>",
    "<S> we study both the real time dynamics of the current and the non - analytic behavior of the tunneling conductance at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we find that the tunneling conductance changes continuously at the transition , being a finite value in the presence of floquet majorana fermions , but dropping to zero as the majorana fermions vanish . for a special choice of parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the majorana fermions revive at larger driving strength , accompanied by the revival of conductances .    </S>",
