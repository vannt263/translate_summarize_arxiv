    "slg is first grown on copper foils ( cu ) by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd)@xcite . a @xmath95 thick cu foil",
    "is loaded in a 4 inch quartz tube and heated to @xmath96  @xmath97 with an h@xmath98 gas flow of 20 cubic centimeters per minute ( sccm ) at 200 mtorr .",
    "the cu foils are annealed at @xmath96  @xmath97 for 30 mins .",
    "the annealing process not only reduces the oxidized foil surface , but also extends the graphene grain size .",
    "the precursor gas , a mixture of h@xmath98 and ch@xmath99 with flow rates of 20 and 40 sccm , is injected into the cvd chamber while maintaining the reactor pressure at 600 mtorr for 30 mins .",
    "the carbon atoms are then adsorbed onto the cu surface , and nucleate slg via grain propagation  @xcite .",
    "finally , the sample is cooled rapidly to room temperature under a hydrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 200 mtorr .",
    "the quality and number of layers of the grown samples are investigated by raman spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "the raman spectrum of graphene grown on cu does not show any d peak , indicating the absence of structural defects .",
    "the 2d peak is a single sharp lorentzian , which is the signature of slg .",
    "we then transfer a @xmath100 region of slg onto quartz substrates ( @xmath101 thick ) as follows .",
    "poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) is spin - coated on the one side of graphene samples .",
    "the graphene films formed on the other side of cu foil , where pmma is not coated , is removed by using oxygen plasma at a pressure of 20 mtorr and a power of 10 w for 30s .",
    "cu is then dissolved in a 0.2 m aqueous solution of ammonium persulphate ( ( nh@xmath99)@xmath102s@xmath102o@xmath103 ) . the pmma / graphene / cu foil",
    "is then left floating until all cu is dissolved .",
    "the remaining pmma / graphene film is cleaned by deionized water to remove residual salt .",
    "finally , the floating pmma / graphene layer is picked up using the target quartz substrate and left to dry under ambient conditions .",
    "after drying , the sample is heated to @xmath104c for @xmath105 to flatten out any wrinkles  @xcite .",
    "the pmma is then dissolved in acetone , leaving the graphene adhered to the quartz substrate .",
    "a portion of the substrate is not covered with graphene , thus allowing the measurement of the nonlinear response of the substrate by a simple transverse translation of the sample .",
    "this contribution is measured to be negligible .",
    "the transferred graphene is then inspected by optical microscopy , raman spectroscopy and absorption microscopy .",
    "after transfer , the 2d peak is still a single sharp lorentzian , indicating that slg has been transferred .",
    "the absence of d peak proves that no structural defects are induced during the transfer process .",
    "raman measurements over a large number of points indicate a@xmath3200mev p - doping@xcite .",
    "the transient absorption spectroscopy setup is driven by a regeneratively - amplified mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( clark instrumentation ) that delivers @xmath106 pulses at @xmath107 with @xmath108 energy at @xmath109 repetition rate .",
    "the laser drives three optical parametric amplifiers ( nopas ) , from which the visible pump pulses and the two near - ir probe pulses are generated .",
    "these are then compressed to the transform limit duration by means of custom made chirped mirrors ( visible nopa ) , a fused silica prism pair ( ir nopa 1 ) and an adaptive shaper based on a deformable mirror ( ir nopa 2 ) .",
    "the pump and probe pulses are synchronized by a motorized translation stage and spatially overlapped on the sample in a slightly noncollinear geometry .",
    "after the sample , the probe beam is focused onto the entrance slit of a spectrometer equipped with a 1024 pixel linear si photodiode array ( entwicklungsbuero stresing ) .",
    "the ir nopa 2 probe pulse is instead detected by an ingaas ccd spectrometer ( bayspec super gamut ) .",
    "both this devices allow a full @xmath84-@xmath110 readout of the spectra . by recording pump - on and pump - off probe spectra",
    ", we extract the differential transmission signal as a function of pump - probe delay ( @xmath23 ) as @xmath111/t_{\\rm off}(\\lambda , t)$ ] .",
    "the system has a sensitivity better than @xmath112 .",
    "the pump intensity was reduced to avoid any sample saturation or high order non - linear effects ( @xmath113 ) . by moving from multichannel to single - wavelength detection",
    ", we were able to reduce the fluence by a factor @xmath114 , and saw a substantially unchanged dynamics .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath22 signal is lower than @xmath115 at the maximum of the pb signature and the signal from the substrate is negligible .",
    "the qbe for the electron distribution , @xmath116 includes collisions integrals due to e - e and e - ph scattering .",
    "the magnitude of the e - ph couplings is discussed in refs .. here we use the values @xmath117 for the phonons at @xmath42 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 for the longitudinal and transverse phonons at @xmath43 , respectively .",

    "the polar angle of @xmath129 does not matter , while the modulus of @xmath129 is equal to @xmath130 .",
    "the dirac delta functions follow from the conservation of total energy @xmath131 and momentum @xmath70 . in eq .",

    "the squared matrix element @xmath136 ( where the integers @xmath137 indicate the dependence on @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 ) includes a summation over spin degrees - of - freedom and direct and exchange  @xcite contributions to e - e scattering .",

    "<S> here we combine extreme temporal resolution broadband pump - probe spectroscopy with a microscopic semi - analytical theory based on the quantum boltzmann equation to investigate e - e collisions in graphene during the very early stages of relaxation . </S>",

    "<S> this immediately points to an ultrafast e - e relaxation , taking place over a timescale comparable to our irf . </S>",
    "<S> the pb signature is nearly featureless as a function of probe wavelength , as expected given the linear dispersion of massless dirac fermions ( mdfs ) in slg . </S>",
    "<S> the selected time traces at different probe photon energies feature a biexponential decay , with a first time constant @xmath18 , and a second longer time constant @xmath19 . in agreement with previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> we assign the first decay to the cooling of the hot electron distribution via interaction with optical phonons , and the longer decay to relaxation of the thermalized electron and phonon distributions by anharmonic decay of hot phonons@xcite . by varying the excitation intensity </S>",

    "<S> .    a deeper insight into the e - e thermalization process can be obtained from the inset of fig.[fig : two]b , showing a delay in the pb maximum onset at longer probe wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by comparing @xmath17 at selected probe delays ( fig.[fig : two]c ) we see that , at early times ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath17 has a positive slope , peaking at high photon energy . </S>",

    "<S> the sub-@xmath2 @xmath6 pump pulse creates an electron distribution peaking at@xmath24 above the fermi level ( red line in fig.[fig : five]e ) , while the probe pulse samples the @xmath25-@xmath26 interval . at early times </S>",
    "<S> we therefore observe the tail of this distribution , with a positive slope . on the other hand , a thermal fermi - dirac distribution , even with a typical doping usually present in as - prepared slg ( chemical potential@xmath27-@xmath28)@xcite , peaks at low photon energies , yielding a differential transmission with a negative slope . </S>",

    "<S> fig.[fig : two]d plots the @xmath17 dynamics measured with the second red - shifted ir probe pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the high temporal resolution combined with the low photon energy allows us to observe an even clearer delay in the pb peak formation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the maximum @xmath17 is reached after @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and  @xmath32 for probe wavelengths of @xmath33 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and  @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , respectively . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",

    "<S> tuning the probe to longer wavelengths also allows us to follow the subsequent e - ph cooling of the carrier distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath38 becomes longer ( @xmath39 at @xmath36 ) when probing at smaller photon energies , consistent with a distribution moving towards the dirac point , before dissipating the excess energy into the phonon bath ( fig.[fig : five]e ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the ultrashort time needed for a hot electron distribution to thermalize in slg is a consequence of e - e collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to discuss theoretically coulomb - mediated two - body collisions in slg ( fig.[fig : three ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these include intra- and inter - band scattering ,  impact ionization \" or  carrier multiplication \" ( cm ) , and auger recombination . in a cm process , for example , electrons in valence band are  ejected \" from the fermi sea and promoted to unoccupied states in conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> cm in graphene could thus play a pivotal role in the realization of very efficient photovoltaic devices and photodetectors with ultra - high sensitivity@xcite . ref . </S>",

    "<S> , however , it has not yet been shown that cm and auger recombination can occur in a 1d manifold embedded in 2d space , since the incoming and outgoing momenta of the scattering particles lie on the same line . </S>",

    "<S> vanishes_. we will come back to this issue below , in connection with the theoretical calculation of the e - e contribution to the collision integral in the quantum boltzmann equation ( qbe ) .        </S>",
    "<S> we use this knowledge of coulomb - mediated collisions in the framework of the qbe , the standard tool to investigate electron dynamics in metals and semiconductors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the equations of motion for the electron ( @xmath40 ) and phonon ( @xmath41 ) distributions , including transverse and longitudinal optical phonon modes at the @xmath42 and @xmath43 points of the brillouin zone@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) labels the conduction ( valence ) band and the valley degree - of - freedom , @xmath46 indicates whether the electron wavevector @xmath47 is measured from @xmath43 or @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron distribution is independent of the spin degree - of - freedom . </S>",
    "<S> qbe describes i ) coulomb scattering between electrons and ii ) phonon - induced electronic transitions , where the energy of an electron decreases ( increases ) by the emission ( absorption ) of a phonon . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the phonons at @xmath42 are responsible for intra - valley transitions , while inter - valley transitions involve @xmath43 phonons . </S>",
    "<S> emission of optical phonons is crucial in the cooling stage of the dynamics and is possible because the energy of photoexcited electrons ( @xmath49 ) is much higher than the typical phonon energy ( @xmath50-@xmath28 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , ph - ph interactions , arising from the anharmonicity of the lattice , are taken into account phenomenologically@xcite , by employing a linear relaxation term , parametrised by a decay rate @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> we neglect acoustic phonons , since they are expected to modify the electron dynamics on a @xmath52 timescale@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even when scattering between electrons and acoustic phonons is assisted by disorder , the so - called  supercollision \" process@xcite , relaxation times@xmath53-@xmath54 have been predicted@xcite and observed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are still too long compared to those considered here .    to simulate the experiments , we solve the qbe with an initial condition given by the superposition of a fermi - dirac distribution in equilibrium with the lattice at @xmath55 and a gaussian peak ( dip ) in conduction ( valence ) band , centered at @xmath56 , with a width of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> ref . argued that the anisotropy introduced in the electron distribution by the pump pulse disappears in a few fs due to e - e scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we thus enforce circular symmetry in our qbe to deal with time - dependent distribution functions , @xmath58 , not dependent on the polar angle @xmath59 of @xmath47 , but on @xmath60 and @xmath61 only , through the dirac - band energy @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the e - e contribution to the qbe for the electron distribution can be written as :    @xmath64 [ 1 - f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{2})]f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{3 } ) f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_4 ) - & & \\nonumber \\\\ f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{1 } ) f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{2 } ) [ 1 -   f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{3})][1 - f_{\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{4 } ) ] \\rbrace~ , & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is the coulomb kernel ( see methods ) describing the exchange of ( momentum and ) energy from @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( incoming states ) to @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( outgoing states ) during a two - body ( intra - valley ) collision . </S>",
    "<S> conservation of energy and momentum are automatically enforced in eq.([eq : circularqbe ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> circular symmetry allows us to treat the angular integrations in the coulomb kernel analytically , taking particular care of the contributions arising from the subtle collinear scattering processes described above ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of intra- and inter - band processes can then be cast into an integration over the allowed total momentum @xmath70 ( see fig.[fig : four]c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> cm and auger recombination require additional care . </S>",
    "<S> as described in fig.[fig : four]c , their phase space in the case of 2d mdfs _ vanishes _ if momentum and energy are conserved . </S>",
    "<S> this statement holds true for infinitely - sharp bare bands with strictly linear dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> non - linear corrections to the mdf hamiltonian in powers of momentum ( measured from the dirac point ) , however , appear due to lattice effects ( _ e.g. _ trigonal warping ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are small in the range of energies set by the pump ( @xmath49)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - linearities appear also due to the inclusion of e - e interactions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these give rise to a self - energy correction to the bare mdf bands , whose real part is responsible for the velocity enhancement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this correction becomes significantly large in the low - doping regime@xcite , while here we are interested in the non - equilibrium dynamics of a substantial population of photexcited electrons ( @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , any effect giving a finite width to the quasiparticle spectral function , such as e - e interactions@xcite , opens up a phase space for auger processes . to calculate the auger contribution to @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> we take into account these electron - lifetime effects by a suitable limiting procedure ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the final result is _ independent _ of the precise mechanism limiting the electron lifetime .    </S>",
    "<S> crucially , we go beyond the fermi golden rule@xcite by including screening in the matrix element of the coulomb interaction , by using the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . to this end , we introduce the screened potential@xcite @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the momentum and energy transfer in a scattering event , respectively , @xmath74 is the 2d fourier transform of the coulomb potential , @xmath75 is an average dielectric screening , depending on the media around the sample@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rpa dynamical dielectric function is @xmath76 , where the non - interacting _ time - dependent _ polarization function @xmath77 depends on the distribution function @xmath78 at time @xmath23 : [ lehmanrepresentation ] ^(0)(q , ; t ) & = & 2 _ s , s ,   + & & |f^()_s s(_k - _ k + q)|^2  . here </S>",
    "<S> the factor two accounts for spin degeneracy , and the chirality factor @xmath79 , which depends on the polar angle @xmath59 of @xmath47 , is defined in methods .    </S>",
    "<S> collinear scattering plays also a key role in the theory of screening of 2d mdfs . </S>",
    "<S> it takes place on the  light cone \" @xmath80 when @xmath81 is either parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath47 in eq.([lehmanrepresentation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a strong peak in the imaginary part of @xmath77 ( which physically represents the spectral density of particle - hole pairs ) close to the light cone@xcite , where @xmath82 $ ] diverges like @xmath83 : rpa dynamical screening _ suppresses _ auger scattering . </S>",
    "<S> since we are looking at effects that are very fast on the time - scale set by plasma oscillations ( @xmath84-@xmath85)@xcite , we also introduce a  static \" approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this consists in evaluating @xmath77 at @xmath86=0 . in the static limit </S>",
    "<S> there is no collinear contribution to the screened potential and the impact of auger processes is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath87 still depends on time through @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> rpa is definitely a very good starting point to deal with screening in metals and semiconductors@xcite , but is certainly not exact . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus allowed to modify the rpa dynamical screening function to interpolate the strength of auger processes between its maximal ( static screening ) and minimal ( dynamic screening ) value . </S>",
    "<S> we thus introduce a third approximate screening model by cutting off the singularity of @xmath77 in the region @xmath88 of width @xmath89 near the light cone . </S>",
    "<S> this regularized polarization function , @xmath90 , leads to a regularized screened potential @xmath91 $ ] , with @xmath92 in our calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our theory is free of fitting parameters and it is predictive from the ir to the optical domain . in the regularized screening model we do _ not _ adjust the value of @xmath93 to yield the best agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , the theory is expected to work better in the ir limit , since it is based on the low - energy mdf hamiltonian and thus neglects band - structure effects , which become non - negligible at high energy .        </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : five ] shows that the theory with dynamical screening compares poorly with experiments , in predicting both the prompt pb onset and its subsequent decay . </S>",
    "<S> while with static and regularized dynamical screening the profile of @xmath22 is in good agreement with experiments ( figs.[fig : five]a , b ) , the dynamics is much slower in the presence of dynamical screening . </S>",
    "<S> this is best seen at low probe energies , fig.[fig : five]b . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the maximum of the differential transmission ( fig.[fig : five]c ) on probe wavelength further highlights the large discrepancy between experiments and theory with dynamical screening . </S>",
    "<S> we trace back this discrepancy to the fact that , as stated above , dynamical screening completely _ suppresses _ auger processes . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that these processes are a crucially important relaxation channel for the non - equilibrium electron dynamics in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : five]c shows clearly that it would have not been possible to draw this conclusion without comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data in the low - energy regime , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ for energies @xmath94 </S>",
    "<S> .    a closer inspection of the dynamics reveals that the thermalization of the initial hot electron distribution ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : five]e ) is accompanied by a very fast equilibration of the chemical potentials of conduction and valence bands , over few tens of fs . </S>",
    "<S> auger processes are the only e - e scattering channel that couples the two bands ( see figs.[fig : three]c , d ) and are thus responsible for this ultrafast equilibration ( e - ph scattering is relevant on the much longer time scale of hundreds of fs@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , hot carriers in conduction band provide a substantial amount of energy for the promotion of electrons from valence to conduction band , resulting in cm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig.[fig : five]f ( see methods for the cm definition ) and is crucial for graphene s application in photovoltaics and photodetectors .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that dynamical screening , when cured by cutting - off the singularity of the polarization function along the light cone with the parameter @xmath93 , improves the agreement with experiments when compared to static screening only . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the static theory underestimates screening since it misses collinear scattering . this explains why @xmath22 calculated with static screening : i ) increases too fast in the early stages , the electron dynamics being initially boosted by the poorly - screened coulomb repulsion , and ii ) slows down too much in the subsequent stages , when poorly - screened carriers begin to accumulate close the dirac point .    in conclusion , we performed time - resolved spectroscopy on single - layer graphene with an unprecedented combination of temporal resolution and spectral tunability allowing us to track the early processes involved in electron thermalization . a microscopic theory based on the quantum boltzmann equation and including collinear scattering and screening is capable of modeling the experimental data with no need of free parameters . in the region of parameter space explored in this experiment this ultrafast equilibration dynamics </S>",
    "<S> can only be explained by considering carrier multiplication and auger recombination as fundamental mechanisms driven by electron - electron interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that collinear coulomb collisions in the intra - band scattering channel yield logarithmically - enhanced quasiparticle decay rates and transport coefficients ( such as viscosities and conductivities)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved ultrafast measurements of the hot - electron distribution may shed light on these important processes .    </S>",
    "<S> ultrashort light pulses could be used to create a super - hot plasma of ultrarelativistic fermions ( massless dirac fermions ) and bosons ( e.g. phonons ) in graphene or in other dirac materials , thereby creating conditions analogue to those in early universe cosmogony , but within a small - scale , table - top experiment . </S>",
