    "for non - perturbative studies of quantum chromodynamics on a space - time lattice the formulation with a chirally rotated mass term @xcite has proven to be a very effective framework .",
    "this so - called twisted mass lattice qcd implies automatic @xmath5 symanzik - improvement if the twist angle is set to a value of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of twisted mass lattice qcd have allowed to determine a number of physically relevant hadronic parameters , notably the gasser - leutwyler low - energy constants , to a high precision .",
    "first studies of twisted mass lattice qcd have been made with two mass - degenerate quark flavours , representing the up and down quarks , and have allowed to obtain results for quantities in the pion sector of qcd @xcite , for a review see @xcite . in recent work these calculations have been extended to @xmath7 quark flavours , meaning a degenerate doublet of up and down quarks and a non - degenerate doublet of charm and strange quarks @xcite .",
    "the chiral twist is implemented with two independent twist angles in the up - down sector and in the strange - charm sector .",
    "both of these angles are tuned to @xmath6 . in the numerical simulations",
    "the mass of the charm quark is on the cut - off scale , whereas the mass of the strange quark is near its physical value , so that physical results about observables in the sector of the the three lightest quarks can be obtained .    for the analysis of the numerical data , which are obtained at varying quark masses",
    ", chiral perturbation theory is an invaluable tool , for a review see @xcite .",
    "chiral perturbation yields analytical formulae for the dependence of physical quantities like meson masses and decay constants on the quark masses .",
    "it amounts to an expansion around the chirally symmetric limit of vanishing quark masses , and is reliable for sufficiently small quark masses .    for the case of twisted mass lattice qcd",
    ", chiral perturbation theory has first been developed and used for @xmath8 quark flavours @xcite .",
    "it has been extended to @xmath9 , including the strange quark , in @xcite . in view of the numerical work on @xmath10 twisted mass lattice qcd , it is the purpose of this article to present chiral perturbation theory for this situation .    of course , at this point the question of the region of applicability of chiral perturbation arises .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is well applicable to quark masses as light as those of the up and down quarks .",
    "the mass of the strange quark has turned out to at the border of the region of validity of chiral perturbation theory , depending on the order of the expansion and the use of partial resummations .",
    "the charm quark is definitely too heavy to be treated within chiral perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , chiral perturbation for twisted mass lattice qcd with @xmath10 quark flavours is not applicable to quantities in all 4 quark sectors . in this article",
    "we restrict ourselves to quantities in the pion- and the kaon - sector .",
    "moreover , for physical values of the strange quark mass , the formulae can not be applied to obtain precise quantitative results in the kaon sector . instead",
    ", the meaning of these calculations is different .",
    "primarily , the idea is to explicitly reveal the structure of @xmath10 twisted mass lattice qcd in the sense of its dependence on the two independent twist angles .",
    "chiral perturbation displays how the values of the two twist angles affect the observables in the different mesonic sectors , and explicitly exhibits the requirements for automatic @xmath5 improvement .",
    "secondly , chiral perturbation theory yields the formulae that would allow to extract @xmath11 low - energy constants from data in the region of unphysically small strange quark masses .",
    "in this letter we present the results of chiral perturbation theory for @xmath10 twisted mass lattice qcd in next - to - leading order .",
    "lattice effects are included up to order @xmath12 .",
    "the special case @xmath13 with two degenerate quark doublets has already been considered in @xcite . in next - to - leading order",
    "our results show differences to @xcite , see below .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is formulated in terms of the pseudo - goldstone fields for spontaneously broken @xmath14 chiral symmetry . for @xmath15 , the 15 canonical fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 , corresponding to the generators @xmath18 of su(4 ) ( see app .  [ generators ] ) ,",
    "are assembled in the matrix valued field @xmath19 . referring to the usual particle multiplets ,",
    "the canonical fields are also denoted @xmath20 .",

    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath25 contains chiral symmetry breaking quark mass terms and lattice terms . to leading order ( lo )",
    "it is given by @xmath26 here the quark mass term is @xmath27 with the quark mass matrix @xmath28 , and the lattice artifacts are represented by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the lattice spacing and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are additional low - energy parameters . in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the contributions to the effective lagrangian contain the gasser - leutwyler coefficients @xmath33 , as well as new coefficients @xmath34 , parameterising the lattice artifacts .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for definitions and details about the nlo lagrangian .      in the lattice regularisation ,",
    "the untwisted physical quark mass @xmath35 is proportional to the difference @xmath36 of the bare and the critical mass ; the prime indicates that the quark mass shift already includes an @xmath37 correction @xmath38 , see @xcite . in the @xmath39-sector",
    "the twisted mass @xmath40 is conveniently introduced via the term @xmath41 . in chiral perturbation theory",
    "we use the variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 in leading order  ( lo ) the pion mass is then given by @xmath44    a second twist can be introduced in the @xmath45-doublet in the same way .",
    "considering the definition of the fields in eq .  , it should be noted that the twist in the @xmath45-doublet has the opposite sign , because @xmath2 and @xmath3 are exchanged so that they are ordered by increasing quark masses in the mass matrix .",
    "following the general argument given in  @xcite , @xmath37-improvement will be realised at twofold maximum twist , i.e.  when both twist angles equal @xmath6 .",
    "maintaining positivity of the fermion determinant requires to implement the twist in the heavy quark sector orthogonal to the mass splitting between the heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "because it is more natural to have a diagonal mass matrix , as e.g.  in  @xcite , the twist is implemented non - diagonally with @xmath46 .    referring to the definitions above we define for the light and the heavy sector @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average heavy quark mass .",
    "the symmetry breaking term  @xmath49 can be written separately for the sectors . with the corresponding pauli matrices  @xmath50",
