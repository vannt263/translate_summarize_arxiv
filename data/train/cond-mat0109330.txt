    "in recent years , there has been an increasing interest on the behaviour of the one - dimensional dissipative maps at their chaos threshold@xcite .",
    "when the sensitivity to the initial conditions is examined at the onset of chaos , the sensitivity function , defined through    \\(t ) = _ x(0)0 , ( where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the discrepancies of the initial conditions at times @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , can be put in a conveniently generalized form    ( t)= ^1/(1-q ) ( q ) , ( solution of @xmath14 ) where @xmath15 is the generalized lyapunov exponent .",
    "this equation recovers the standard exponential form @xmath16 for @xmath17 ( here , @xmath18 is the standard lyapunov exponent ) , but generically @xmath19 corresponds to a power - law behaviour . in this case , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) the system is said to be _ weakly _ insensitive ( sensitive ) to the initial conditions , a situation which is different from the standard case where we have _ strong _ insensitivity ( sensitivity ) for @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "although asymptotic power - law sensitivity to initial conditions was observed previously@xcite , @xmath26 as given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) provides a more complete description than just @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . at the edge of chaos",
    ", @xmath26 presents strong fluctuations with time , reflecting the fractal structure of the critical attractor , and eq.(2 ) delimits the power - law growth of the upper bounds of the sensitivity function .",
    "these upper bounds allow us to estimate the proper value @xmath29 of the index @xmath9 for the map under consideration .",
    "this method has already been successfully used for a variety of one - dimensional dissipative maps such as logistic@xcite , @xmath30-logistic@xcite , circle@xcite , @xmath30-circular@xcite maps .",
    "the second method of estimating the @xmath29 value of the map under consideration comes from the geometrical aspects of the attractor at the chaos threshold .",
    "this method is based on the multifractal singularity spectrum @xmath8 , which reflects the fractal dimension of the subset with singularity strength @xmath31@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 function is a down - ward parabola - like concave curve and typically vanishes at two points , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 , characterizing the scaling behavior of the most concentrated and most rarefied regions on the attractor .",
    "the study of the scaling behaviour of these regions led two of us to propose a new scaling relation as@xcite    = - .",
    "( q^ * < 1 ) this is , in fact , a fascinating relation since it connects the power - law sensitivity to initial conditions of such dynamical systems with purely geometrical quantities and consequently it provides a completely different method for the determination of the proper @xmath29 value of the map under consideration .",
    "this method has also been used so far for logistic@xcite , @xmath30-logistic@xcite , circle@xcite and @xmath30-circular@xcite maps , and the results obtained for the @xmath29 values are within a good precision the same as those of the first method .    in order to make the situation even more enlightening ,",
    "a third method of obtaining the proper @xmath29 value of a given map has been introduced very recently using a specific generalization of the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xcite .",
    "it is known that , for a chaotic dynamical system , the rate of loss of information can be characterized by the ks entropy ( @xmath34 ) and it is defined as the increase , per unit time , of the standard boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath35 ( we use @xmath36 ) . in fact , the ks entropy is defined , in principle , through a _ single - trajectory _ in phase space based on the frequencies of appearance , in increasingly long strips , of symbolic sequences of the regions of the partitioned phase space @xcite . however , apparently in almost all cases , this definition can be equivalently replaced by an ensemble - based procedure , which is , no doubt , by far simpler computationally than the former procedure .",
    "this ensemble - based version is the one we use herein . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth noting that a single - trajectory - based procedure has been used very recently in @xcite .    from the pesin equality , namely , @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise , it is evident that the ks entropy is deeply related to the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the ks entropy rate is then defined through @xmath40 , where @xmath13 is the time steps , @xmath41 is the number of regions in the partition of the phase space and @xmath42 is the number of initial conditions ( all chosen at @xmath43 within one region among the @xmath41 available ones ) that are evolving in time . on the other hand , for the marginal cases where @xmath44 , a generalized version of the ks entropy @xmath45 has been introduced @xcite as the increase rate of a proper nonextensive entropic form , namely    s_q(t)= .",
    "this entropy enables a generalization of the standard boltzmann - gibbs statistics @xcite and it covers the bg entropy as a special case in the @xmath46 limit .",
    "a general review and related subjects on this nonextensive formalism can be found in @xcite ; recent applications in high energy physics , turbulence and biology can be seen in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "therefore , for the generalized version of ks entropy , the entropy rate is proposed to be    k_q_t_w _ n .",
    "consistently , the pesin equality is also expected to be generalizable as @xmath47 if @xmath48 and @xmath49 otherwise .",
    "consequently , these ideas have been used very recently to construct a third method of estimating the @xmath29 values @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that ( i ) a unique value of @xmath29 exists such that @xmath45 is finite for @xmath50 , vanishes for @xmath51 and diverges for @xmath52 , ( ii ) this value of @xmath29 coincides with that coming from the other two methods described previously .",
    "these conjectures have been verified with numerical calculations , at the edge of chaos , for the standard logistic map @xcite , logistic - like map family and generalized cosine map @xcite , which strongly supports the point that all three methods yield one and the same special @xmath29 value of a map under consideration . at this point , it is worth mentioning that when the initial conditions are very spread in phase space ( instead of the localized ones ) , another class of @xmath29 values ( above unity instead of below unity ) has been found for @xmath30-logistic case @xcite .    although these three different methods of finding @xmath29 value have been already tested and numerically verified for a number of one - dimensional dissipative map families , it is no doubt convenient ( in the spirit of further clarifying their domain of validity ) to test them in more general grounds .",
    "for example , all the maps discussed so far belong to one - dimensional , dissipative , symmetric , one- or two - parameter unimodal families . at this point",
    ", one can ask what happens for the ( i ) two- ( or more ) dimensional maps , ( ii ) conservative maps , ( iii ) asymmetric families .",
    "needless to say , if anyone of these cases could be analyzed with the above mentioned three methods consistently , the scenario would obviously become more robust . in the present effort",
    ", we shall try to make a step forward addressing the point ( iii ) , namely the asymmetric three - parameter family of logistic map of the form    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath5 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the properties of this kind of asymmetric map family have already been studied @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric shape of the map family is illustrated in fig .",
    "1a for a typical value of ( @xmath57 ) pair , whereas in fig .",
    "1b the bifurcation diagram has been plotted . before the onset of chaos ,",
    "the sequence of bifurcations is the same as that of feigenbaum , but in the chaotic region ( after the onset of chaos ) , the relative sizes of the various windows are quite different from those of the @xmath30-logistic map ( namely , @xmath58 ) .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that this map family fails to exhibit the metric universality of feigenbaum . in this case",
    ", the scaling factors ( feigenbaum numbers ) @xmath59 and @xmath60 present an oscillatory divergent behaviour @xcite .",
    "same kind of oscillatory behaviour has also been observed for multifractal function @xmath61 @xcite .    since @xmath29 values were not available for asymmetric logistic map family",
    ", it was not possible to see the behaviour of @xmath29 as a function of the ( @xmath57 ) pairs .",
    "on the other hand , in a very recent effort @xcite , in order to see this behaviour , _ without finding the precise values of @xmath29 for ( @xmath57 ) pairs _ , one of us has used another technique based on the very recent generalization of bit cumulants for chaotic systems @xcite . in spite of the fact that in @xmath9-generalized bit cumulant theory , @xmath9 is a free parameter , it seems from the results of @xcite that as @xmath62",
    ", @xmath29 will approach unity , which is similar to the behaviour observed for symmetric maps studied so far @xcite .",
    "we are now prepared to proceed with our numerical results for the asymmetric logistic map family .",
    "first of all , since our aim is to look at the properties of this family at the onset of chaos , the calculated values of the critical map parameter ( @xmath63 ) as a function of ( @xmath57 ) pairs are given in fig .  2 and in the table .",
    "it is evident that the behaviour of @xmath63 values with respect to ( @xmath64 ) is very similar to the tendency of @xmath63 values of the @xmath30-logistic family with respect to parameter @xmath30 .",
    "as already discussed above , this method is based on the sensitivity to initial conditions and for the asymmetric logistic map family , the sensitivity function @xmath26 is given by    \\(t ) = _ t=1^l and exhibits , at the chaos threshold , a power - law divergence , @xmath65 , from where @xmath29 values can be calculated by measuring , on a log - log plot , the upper bound slope @xmath66 . in fig .  3 , for @xmath67 ,",
    "the behaviour of the sensitivity function has been illustrated for two typical ( @xmath57 ) pairs .",
    "the slope of the upper bound has been calculated for each pair between the time interval [ 4,8.5 ] .",
    "we encountered that , as @xmath68 values become larger ( that is the map becomes more asymmetric ) , the number of points that could be used in estimating the slope becomes fewer .",
    "for such cases , one should go for times larger than say 8.5 ( in logarithmic scale ) , which requires much more precision on the values of @xmath63 . on the other hand , for the @xmath69 pairs given in the table , the above mentioned time interval",
    "is good enough to determine the slope . from this slope , for each pair , we calculate the @xmath29 values and in fig .",
    "4 we exhibit the behaviour of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath68 for two typical pairs .",
    "it is seen that as @xmath68 goes @xmath70 , @xmath29 becomes closer to unity .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the recent claim of @xcite and also similar to the behaviour of symmetric map families studied so far @xcite .",
    "as mentioned previously , for this asymmetric family , the multifractal function @xmath8 fluctuates considerably for different number of iterations ( @xmath71 ) which prevents us to estimate exact values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 from where we determine @xmath29 values .",
    "worse than that , this problem can not be cured by extrapolating the number of iterations to infinity as it is done in @xcite for the @xmath30-circular maps and @xcite for the single - site map . in @xmath30-circular case , the fluctuations are so systematic that one can extrapolate the results to infinite number of iterations with acceptable precision from where @xmath32 and @xmath33 values could be deduced , whereas for asymmetric logistic family this is not the case . to illustrate this",
    ", we plotted the @xmath8 curve for the inflexion pair @xmath72 in fig  5a , where the oscillatory behaviour is evident .",
    "moreover , we presented in fig  5b the extrapolation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the same pair .",
    "it is clear from the confidence interval that it is not possible to estimate the correct values of them due to large fluctuations .",
    "this yields us to conclude that for this asymmetric map family , the second method can not be used easily to determine @xmath29 values due to the unavoidable fluctuations in the @xmath8 function . in fact , this result has also been supported by a recent observation : one of us has shown recently @xcite that for @xmath30-logistic maps , the scaling relation given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be reexpressed as @xmath73/[\\ln\\alpha_f(z)]$ ] , which clearly points out that this scaling is dependent of feigenbaum constant @xmath59 . since for the asymmetric map family we are studying , as already mentioned , the feigenbaum numbers exhibit oscillatory divergent behaviour @xcite , it is evident that @xmath29 values can not be easily and reliably inferred from the scaling relation due to these fluctuations .",
    "finally , in order to verify the results of the first method , let us use the entropy increase rate procedure to estimate the proper @xmath29 values .",
    "the procedure is the following : first , we partition the phase space into @xmath41 equal cells , then we choose one of them and select @xmath42 initial conditions ( all inside the chosen cell ) . as @xmath13 evolves , these initial conditions spread within the phase space and naturally this gives us a set @xmath74 with @xmath75 , which consequently yields a set of probabilities @xmath76 . in the beginning of time , clearly @xmath77 , then it gradually exhibits three successive regions as firstly indicated in @xcite for a different system .",
    "in the first region , the entropy is roughly constant in time , then it starts increasing in the second region and finally it tends towards its saturation value .",
    "this indicates that the linear increase of the proper entropy is expected to emerge in the second ( intermediate ) region .",
    "as clearly explained in @xcite , at the chaos threshold , very large fluctuations appear in the entropy due to the fact that the critical attractor occupies only a tiny part of the available phase space . to overcome this problem",
    ", we use a procedure of averaging over the efficient initial conditions as discussed in @xcite .",
    "since this procedure is very time - consuming , we apply it for two typical ( @xmath57 ) pairs to check the results of the first method .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "it is observed that , for all cases , in the intermediate region , the linear increase of the entropy with time emerges only for a special value of @xmath9 ( namely @xmath29 ) , and this value corresponds , within a good precision , to the one obtained from the first method . on the other hand , for @xmath52 ( @xmath51 )",
    "it curves upwards ( downwards ) . to provide quantitative support to this",
    ", we fit the curves with the polynomial @xmath78 in the interval [ @xmath79 characterizing the intermediate region .",
    "the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath80 is a measure of the importance of the nonlinear term , therefore @xmath81 vanishes for a strictly linear fit .",
    "these results are given as insets of fig .",
    "in this work , we performed an extensive analysis of the sensitivity to initial conditions problem related to a family of asymmetric maps at the edge of chaos .",
    "we have been particularly interested in exploiting the connections between the sensitivity function , generalized non - extensive entropies and the multifractal character of the critical attractor .    a direct numerical computation of the sensitivity function @xmath26 , which measures the temporal evolution of the distance between initially nearby trajectories , shows strong fluctuations whose upper bounds delimit a power - law growth @xmath82 .",
    "the characteristic power - law exponent was determined for several pairs of the inflexions at the left and right of map inflexion point .",
    "for extremely asymmetric maps , wild fluctuations do not allow the power - law exponents to be determined with high accuracy , but the general trend indicates that @xmath29 approaches unity in the limit of very asymmetric maps .",
    "we also employed a multifractal analysis , based on the standard halsey _",
    "et al _ algorithm@xcite , to compute the singularity spectrum @xmath61 related to the critical attractor of the present family of asymmetric maps . a recently proposed scaling relation associates the extremal points of the @xmath61 curve with the power - law exponent governing the sensitivity function . however , the numerical method used to compute @xmath8 exhibits large fluctuations when applied to these asymmetric maps .",
    "this feature makes difficult the precise estimate of the location of its extremal points",
    ". it would be valuable to have an alternative algorithm to compute the @xmath8 curve which could overcome this point to allow a fine check the accuracy of the scaling relation ( eq .",
    "3 ) for these asymmetric maps .",
    "finally , the sensitivity to initial conditions was investigated by computing the rate of increase of generalized entropies @xmath7 . at the edge of chaos",
    ", there is a particular entropic index @xmath29 for which the entropy grows , in the infinitely fine - graining limit , at a stationary rate after a short initial transient .",
    "this method provides values for @xmath29 which are in agreement with the ones obtained from the direct measure of the sensitivity function . although being more time consuming , the entropy measure is free from wild fluctuations and allows for a relatively fine and confident estimate of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , this method should be the starting point to investigate the possibility of similar power - law sensitivity to initial conditions in higher dimensional as well as conservative non - linear dynamical systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
