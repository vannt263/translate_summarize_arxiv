    "over recent years the cosmological status of accreting supermassive black holes ( bhs ) has been elevated from an extreme rarity to a ubiquitous phase in the life cycle of all massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "occasionally nature is particularly kind and puts obscuring material between us and the accretion disk . in these cases , we know that an accreting bh is present due to the ratios of strong emission lines that imply a very hard ionizing spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and bhs selected this way are known as narrow - line or type 2 agns .",
    "these objects are an ideal tool with which to study agn host galaxies , since the galaxy to agn contrast ratio is maximized .",
    "much of what we know about the stellar populations of agn host galaxies is derived from narrow - line objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , until recently there were not large samples of homogeneously selected , _ luminous _ narrow - line agns .",
    "the situation has been remedied by the large spectroscopic database provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the strong and ubiquitous [ ] @xmath8 line emission as a proxy for bolometric luminosity in order to select a sample of narrow - line agns as luminous as any known broad - line active galaxies with @xmath9 .",

    "our primary goal is to study the evolutionary state of the host galaxies of vigorously accreting bhs .",
    "both stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath14 ) and stellar population age can be measured from the stellar continua . from @xmath14  we derive not only a mass - scale for the galaxy , but also an estimate of the bh mass and in turn eddington fractions for the sample , assuming that the @xmath7  relation holds ( which may not be the case for active galaxies at these redshifts ; e.g. , * ? ?",

    "our goal was to select nearby targets , for which we could hope to resolve the emission - line structure , that are nevertheless at the upper end of the luminosity function .",

    "altogether , we obtained spectroscopic observations for 15 targets .",
    "our sample spans , by construction , a much narrower range in redshift ( and thus luminosity ) than the parent sample .",
    "all of the data discussed in this paper were collected over two observing runs using the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) at the clay - magellan telescope on las campanas .",
    "ldss3 is a wide - field ( 8.3  diameter ) imaging spectrograph , which was upgraded from the original ldss2 @xcite to have increased sensitivity in the red . for each target",
    "we obtained 25 min acquisition images in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and sometimes @xmath22 .",
    "we then spent at least 1 hr per target at the primary slit position , as well as additional time as noted in table 1 , using a 1@xmath234slit .",
    "slit position angles were chosen by manual inspection of the sdss color images , with an eye to investigate color gradients or low - surface brightness material ( table 1 ) .",
    "the seeing ranged from 06 to 15 over the two runs , but was typically 1 ; with a plate scale of 0189 the spectra are well sampled in the spatial direction .",
    "two spectroscopic settings were required in order to ensure that [ ]  was observed over the full redshift range of our sample .",
    "the primary setting was the reddest position of the vph - blue grism , which covers @xmath24  .",
    "for the highest redshift targets , we needed a redder setting , and used the bluest setting of the vph - red grism , which covers @xmath25  .",
    "our velocity resolution was @xmath26  km  s@xmath12  for both settings .",
    "each night , in addition to the science targets , we observed two to four spectro - photometric standards covering a range of airmass .",
    "finally , over the course of the runs we also observed a large library of velocity template stars , consisting mostly of g ",
    "m giants .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures , with the exception of pattern - noise removal as discussed below .",
    "we first performed cosmic - ray 0.2 in removal on each individual frame using the spectroscopic version of lacosmic @xcite .",
    "we performed bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , pattern noise removal ( when necessary ; see below ) and rectification using the carnegie observatories reduction package cosmos .",
    "the rectification works extremely well ; in the rectified images the trace centroid typically migrates by less than two spatial pixels across the full spectrum , with the maximum drift being five pixels .",
    "cosmos optionally performs sky subtraction prior to rectification @xcite , but we have found that for the purposes of stellar velocity dispersion measurements we achieve significantly better sky subtraction using _ apall _ in iraf on the rectified , but not sky - subtracted , frames .",
    "we have used several apertures for spatial extractions , but for most of this paper we focus on a 225 spatial extraction , which is well - matched to the point - spread function ( psf ) for the majority of our observations .",
    "generally we did not use optimal extraction @xcite in order to avoid emission - line clipping .    once the spectra were extracted , we performed flux calibration , minor shifts to the wavelength calibration and telluric absorption corrections using idl routines , following methods described by @xcite .",
    "these routines provide considerable flexibility and control in the selection of bandpasses for spectrophotometric calibration used to perform a spline fit to the continuum .",
    "small corrections are made , if necessary , to the wavelength solutions using a cross - correlation with sky lines , and a heliocentric correction is applied .",
    "our spectrophotometric standards are typically white dwarfs , and thus the smooth continuum is ideally suited to telluric absorption removal as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "below we show that our flux calibration agrees reasonably well with the sdss by comparing flux measurements of the [ ]  line .",
    "the final spectra have a considerably higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) than the sdss spectra . for @xmath27 , the median s /",
    "n at @xmath28    is 150 per pixel , which is typically 4 times higher than the sdss , while for @xmath29 , the median s / n over the same region is 11 per pixel and 8 times higher than the sdss spectra .",
    "-0 mm    ldss3 , particularly during the march 2007 observation period , had intermittent but substantial pattern noise .",
    "pattern noise appears as periodic striping in the data , with a typical scale of a few pixels and an amplitude ( in these data ) of 50100 counts .",
    "the amplitude and phase vary in time and so standard calibrations do not remove it but there is a cosmos task that fourier transforms the data and removes the high - frequency noise .",
    "our concern is that the frequency of the pattern noise is comparable in scale to that of the expected stellar velocity dispersions , potentially leading to biases in our final measurements . in order to test this possibility ,",
    "we have performed three independent pattern - noise removal runs for the first night , which has particularly bad pattern noise .",
    "we have measured the dispersions independently for each of these spectra .",
    "the rms in the measured @xmath14  values for the four objects range from 3 to 20 km  s@xmath12 , and , most crucially , we see no systematic differences in the measured dispersion for different versions of the pattern - noise removal .",
    "we conservatively add an additional 20  km  s@xmath12 uncertainty in quadrature to the measured dispersions that suffer from pattern noise .",
    "one of the primary uncertainties in interpreting observations of narrow - line quasars comes from their unknown bh masses . for the median @xmath30}}$]@xmath31  erg  s@xmath12 of the magellan sample",
    ", we estimate that the bolometric luminosity is @xmath32 erg s@xmath12 , which suggests bh masses of @xmath33  @xmath3  if they emit at or below their eddington limits [ where we take the eddington luminosity to be @xmath34  ( @xmath2/@xmath3 ) erg s@xmath12 ] .",
    "however , given the scatter between [ ]  and bolometric luminosity , the range of bolometric luminosities in the sample , and their ( presumed ) range of intrinsic eddington ratios , it would be nice to have an independent estimate of the bh masses . at the same time",
    ", it would be very useful to have a mass scale for the host galaxies .",
    "although it is indirect , if we assume that the @xmath7  relation holds , then we can use measurements of bulge velocity dispersions both to provide an estimate of the bh masses in the sample and as a proxy for the mass of the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we describe the @xmath14  measurements and uncertainties ; the bh masses are presented in  5 .",
    "there are a variety of commonly used techniques for measuring stellar velocity dispersions in galaxies . for computational expediency ,",
    "most of them rely on fourier techniques , including cross - correlation @xcite , the fourier quotient method @xcite , and the fourier correlation quotient @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to directly compare broadened templates with data in pixel space ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "direct - pixel fitting methods , while relatively computationally expensive , provide many benefits over fourier techniques ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the ability both to fit over restricted regions and to mask complicating emission or absorption features .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , even faint emission lines can lead to substantial biases in derived @xmath14  measurements if not properly accounted for .",
    "our galaxy models are built from a linear combination of stellar spectra .",
    "the program object is de - redshifted using the sdss redshift , but inevitably small velocity shifts are present between the templates -0.2 in and the target .",
    "thus , each template is shifted to zero velocity , diluted by a constant or power - law component @xmath36 , convolved with a gaussian @xmath37 , and multiplied by a polynomial @xmath38 : @xmath39 + c(\\lambda ) \\}\\ ] ] the nonlinear levenberg - marquardt algorithm , as implemented by mpfit in idl @xcite , is used to minimize @xmath40  in pixel space between the galaxy and the model .",
    "our code is based on that presented in @xcite , except that the model spectrum is actually a linear combination of stars ( typically four in this work ) with their relative amplitudes as additional free parameters .",
    "this version of the code was developed to model the high - quality nuclear spectra from the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies @xcite and is presented and extensively tested in @xcite . unless otherwise noted we have used the following four stars as our template set : hd 26574 ( f2  iii ) , hd 107950 ( g5  iii ) , hd 18322 ( k1  iii ) , and hd 131507 ( k4  iii ) .",
    "example fits are shown in figure 1 .",
    "while the primary purpose of the multi - template fitting is to achieve reliable fits , we also extract crude stellar population information in  7 .    in order to use the full spectral range of the observations , we can not rely only on our own template stars ,",
    "whose wavelength coverage does not go blueward of @xmath414300  .",
    "rather , we utilize a large library of high - s / n , high - spectral resolution ( @xmath42  km  s@xmath12 ) stellar templates from @xcite .",
    "it is best to use template stars observed with an identical instrumental setup as the targets , so that the measured broadening can be ascribed solely to internal kinematics in the galaxy .",
    "however , the valdes templates not only allow us to include spectral features such as the g - band @xmath43    to the highest redshifts , but also provide a wide range of spectral types to help minimize the impact of template mismatch .",
    "we thus use a simple bootstrapping procedure to remove the impact of differing instrumental resolutions on the measured dispersions .",
    "first of all , we measure the intrinsic broadening of the    -0 mm ldss3 template stars using the valdes library .",
    "while we did not observe identical stars , we can match the stars in spectral type nearly exactly .",
    "we expect the relative broadening to be @xmath44  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "we measure a mean broadening over 10 stars of 60@xmath457  km  s@xmath12 . dividing the sample into the two runs",
    "demonstrates the stability of the spectrograph ; we find 61@xmath458  km  s@xmath12and 59@xmath457  km  s@xmath12 , respectively . here and throughout , when we quote errors on mean quantities , we are quoting the standard deviation of the distribution rather than the error on the mean .",
    "we then confirm that our conversion works properly by measuring the velocity dispersions of our targets with the valdes templates and comparing the values to those measured from our internal templates , again being careful to match the spectral types of the template stars and the fitting regions .",
    "the resulting dispersions are shown in figure 2 , where the reported valdes dispersions have been reduced by @xmath46  km  s@xmath12  in quadrature .",
    "it appears that our conversion is quite robust . from now on we report results based entirely on the valdes stars with the above correction , conservatively adding 7 km  s@xmath12  in quadrature to our error budget .",
    "the resulting @xmath14  measurements are shown in table 2 .",
    "in the interest of uniformity , in all cases we use the spectral region 41005400  , which is accessible for every observation .",
    "we follow @xcite and mask out the @xmath47  @xmath48 triplet .",
    "while the @xmath47  triplet is one of the highest equivalent width ( ew ) features in this spectral region , the well - known correlation between the [ mg / fe ] ratio and @xmath14(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads to a systematic overestimate of @xmath14  based on @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "-0 mm      in order to increase our sample size , we have also considered all of the targets in the @xcite sample . since most of the spectra",
    "do not have the required s / n for reliable velocity dispersion measurement , we have limited our attention to objects with a median s / n of @xmath4915 per pixel between 5080 and 5400  , and an ew in the ca k line greater than 3  .",
    "there are 547 objects with @xmath50 } > 10^{42}$ ]  erg  s@xmath12 ; of those , 111 make our cut .",
    "the sdss velocity dispersions are measured in an identical fashion as the fits described above , using the same mix of valdes template stars . in this case , we assume an instrumental resolution of 71 km  s@xmath12  for the sdss spectra ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss - derived @xmath30}}$ ]  values , our measured velocity dispersions , and [ ]  line widths for this additional sample are all presented in table 3 .",
    "two objects are unresolved ( @xmath14@xmath51  km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "there are only two objects from the magellan sample for which we can measure reliable dispersions from the sdss spectra , and the resulting dispersions agree with ours within the quoted uncertainties .",
    "our quoted uncertainties are a quadrature sum of the formal errors from the fit and the 7  km  s@xmath12  uncertainty incurred in converting to the valdes system .",
    "our typical uncertainties thus derived range from @xmath52 for the lower - redshift targets to @xmath53 for the most distant and luminous targets .    as the s / n in the spectrum decreases , our ability to recover the true dispersion decreases .",
    "also , an increasing contribution to the continuum from sources apart from old stars lowers their ew and thus the s / n . to a small degree",
    "the relative incurred error also depends on the true dispersion .",
    "-0.1 in we run a suite of simulations designed to quantify each of these effects by adding gaussian random noise and a constant continuum of various levels to one of the template stars that has been broadened to various widths .",
    "we create ten mock spectra for each s / n value , and then measure @xmath14  for each mock spectrum .",
    "this simple input - output experiment shows that our error bars are reasonable .",
    "we expect @xmath54 errors for the targets with @xmath55 and @xmath56 continuum dilution ( fig .",
    "systematic uncertainties may be introduced in the gas and stellar dispersions due to our use of fixed angular rather than physical apertures . in the case of the stars",
    ", we are typically extracting the spectra at @xmath57 .",
    "since the velocity dispersion profiles of bulge - dominated galaxies are known to be flat ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in general aperture bias should be small compared to the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the only potential exceptions are the disk - dominated galaxies ( j1106 , j1222 , and j1253 ) for which disk contamination may be significant . in the case of the gas , line widths can change dramatically as a function of aperture ( typically getting narrower at large radius ) .",
    "unfortunately , the dependence of gas dispersion on radius varies substantially from object to object ( see , e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and there is no physically motivated aperture to choose .",
    "in future work we will explore the full variation in gas velocity dispersion and luminosity as a function of radius .",
    "a convenient additional product of our velocity dispersion fits is a continuum - subtracted emission - line spectrum for each target .",
    "since we are interested in the [ ]  line when it falls in the bandpass , we extend the model out to the bluest available pixels although we do not use those wavelengths in the fitting .",
    "examples of the continuum - subtracted spectra are shown in figure 1 , and we note that all spectra have been extracted with a 225 aperture .",
    "we fit the h@xmath58 , [ ] , and [ ]  lines with multi - component fits .",
    "briefly , the [ ]  @xmath59 lines are modeled with identical sets of gaussian components , where the centroid shifts are fixed to the laboratory value .",
    "the h@xmath58  line is fit with a combination of two gaussians ( but see  7 for an alternate fit ) .",
    "our prescription follows that described in detail in greene & ho ( 2005a ) , except that unlike that work in general we require more than two components to adequately model the lines .",
    "furthermore , we do not place any restrictions on the relative widths or strengths of the lines .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath60 lines are modeled with identical sets gaussian components ( usually two ) , and the line ratios in the doublet are fixed to one .",
    "this procedure is necessary to decouple true velocity dispersion from the small velocity separation of the two components of the doublet .",
    "the line widths and strengths are shown in table 4 .",
    "the [ ]  line is known to have an asymmetric profile , often with a prominent blue wing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that using a two - component fit and removing the blue wing results in a line width that better tracks @xmath14 .",
    "however , we find that in many cases a two - component model is not an adequate description of these lines . as shown by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fwhm of the line is relatively free of bias from the velocity structure at the base of the line .",
    "therefore , we simply take @xmath61=fwhm/2.35 , as measured from our best - fit emission - line model .",
    "although in the bulk of this paper we focus on the extractions with a 225 aperture , we have made a variety of other extractions , with widths of 378 , 567 , and 756 .",
    "the last has an effective area comparable to the sdss fiber ( 7 arcsec@xmath62 ) . in figure 4",

    "one object is a significant outlier ; our measurement of j2212 is @xmath64 times fainter than that derived from the sdss spectrum .",
    "this problem persists regardless of the flux calibrator used .",
    "it is curious , since we do not see a similar problem for any other target observed on this night .",
    "since the discrepancy is seen in both the continuum level and the @xmath30}}$ ]  value , and since j2212 is a highly disturbed and spatially extended system (  4 ) , we suspect that we were just unlucky in our slit placement and missed some luminous region of the galaxy .",
    "none of the conclusions presented here are impacted if we use the sdss luminosity rather than ours .",
    "if we remove j2212 , then the scatter between the two sets of measurements drops to 0.15 dex .",
    "we note that in our own observations @xmath30}}$ ]  can vary by as much as @xmath65 between different aperture positions , and so we are satisfied with this level of agreement .",
    "we have also reduced the acquisition images ( table 1 ) using standard bias - subtraction and flat - fielding routines within iraf . we do not attempt to remove the pattern noise in the images .",
    "each frame is tied to the sdss photometric system using three to six field stars .",
    "we use the iraf package _ phot _ to perform aperture photometry on these relatively uncrowded fields , and then calculate a weighted average zeropoint based on the reported photometric errors in the sdss photometry .",
    "the formal uncertainties in the final zeropoints are @xmath66 mag .",
    "the ground - based imaging reaches a typical surface brightness limit of @xmath67 mag arcsec@xmath68 , and it is worth using the images to derive bulge - to - disk decompositions for the sample . our goal is to isolate the bulge - like component of the host galaxy in order to compare with the @xcite relation of inactive bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "the faber - jackson relation can provide a valuable diagnostic as to whether the galaxy has reached the relaxed state of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "we use the two - dimensional surface brightness fitting program galfit @xcite to model each galaxy .",
    "our band of choice is sloan @xmath21 , since we have it for the majority of the targets .",
    "however , for various reasons we are forced in a few cases to model either the @xmath20- or @xmath22-band image .",

    "broad - line agns the modeling is relatively straightforward in this case since there is no nuclear point source . as a rule ,",
    "however , parameter coupling is a major complication ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus our operating principle is to model each galaxy with the minimum number of components .",
    "we are particularly interested in the bulge components of these galaxies , and we only introduce a disk component if visible in the images . in distinguishing between bulges and bars for disk - dominated galaxies we use the reduced @xmath40  to determine the preferred model , but we generally can not constrain more than two galaxy components robustly . for the purposes of this paper we have not placed rigorous limits on the presence of low surface - brightness components ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "-0 mm    even without a nuclear point source , proper modeling of the observed light distribution requires convolution with a psf .",
    "we follow @xcite and use _ daophot _ as implemented within iraf to build a psf model , using no fewer than five isolated field stars on the same chip as the target galaxy .",
    "the psf thus constructed is both noise - free and directly based on the psf from the current image .",
    "two - dimensional modeling provides a few advantages worth noting .",
    "for one thing , we gain the freedom to assign different position angles and ( if necessary ) centroids to different components ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another major benefit of galfit for these galaxies , which often have nearby companions , is that we can simultaneously model the surrounding galaxies rather than mask them , which provides a considerably better model of the background .",
    "all fits are shown in figure 5 .",
    "uncertainties in the measured parameters are driven primarily by the psf model and the sky level , as well as inadequacies in the assumed model for the surface brightness profile . in order to estimate the former ,",
    "we adopt a single star from the field as an additional psf model .",
    "we further run a pair of models in which the sky level is increased and decreased by @xmath78 , which is the typical dispersion in sky values across the field .",
    "the final error bars represent the dispersion in each parameter from these four alternate runs .",
    "our methodology is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the hardest uncertainties to estimate arise when our assumed model is incorrect .",
    "indeed , in j1356 and j2212 ( see table 2 and fig .",
    "5 ) , the isophotes are so disturbed due to ongoing merging activity that we do not achieve a sensible fit from a simple combination of one or two srsic  components . in these two cases , due to the presence of tidal features and spatially overlapping nuclei , our models are not particularly meaningful . instead , we adopt a nonparametric @xcite magnitude for clearly disturbed systems , as noted in table 2 . furthermore , although the direct light from the active nucleus is extincted by many orders of magnitude , some of it escapes along unobscured directions , scatters off of the interstellar matter in the host galaxy and reaches the observer .",
    "both our photometric modeling ( see below ) and spectroscopic fitting (  7 ) may be affected by this component .",
    "finally , we do not have usable magellan images for j1124 or j1142 , and so we adopt sdss magnitudes in table 2 .    as a sanity check",

    "@xcite .    as seen in figure 6",
    ", our narrow - line quasars appear to span @xmath89 dex in bh mass , luminosity , and eddington ratio .",
    "nominally , the eddington ratios cluster around the value log  @xmath5@xmath90 with a dispersion of 0.7 dex ( see the best - fit gaussian fit to the distribution in figure 6_b _ ) , but it is important to bear in mind how the eddington ratios are obtained . as was mentioned above , there is an 0.4 dex uncertainty in the conversion from @xmath30}}$ ]  to @xmath91 . furthermore , there is a @xmath92 dex uncertainty associated with each @xmath2  measurement which arises from the uncertainty in the velocity dispersion .",

    "for one thing , they are active ( i.e. , currently accreting ) bhs and thus may be offset from the local relation @xcite .",
    "in addition , there may or may not be significant redshift evolution of the local @xmath7relation that we use to calculate @xmath2 , and both the sign and the magnitude of this change are at present unknown @xcite .",

    "@xcite see clear evidence for wolf - rayet features in @xmath136 of their targets ( we see none in this sample ) , which constitute a clear signature of a recent burst of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite find very high star formation rates from mid - infrared spectroscopy , for a different sample of luminous narrow - line agns , rates that are substantially higher than either those seen in inactive galaxies of similar mass or those in typical broad - line agn samples of similar luminosity .",
    "now , @xcite find compelling evidence that the post - starburst fraction increases with increasing [ ]  luminosity . we may be seeing a hint that the galaxy growth rate scales with agn luminosity even up to starbursts at the highest agn luminosities ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "images show that hosts of luminous narrow - line quasars from the sdss - selected sample are bulge - dominated @xcite , whereas those of somewhat less luminous ( by about 0.5 dex ) ir - selected narrow - line quasars are dusty , disky systems @xcite .",
    "this paper presents observations of objects with luminosities very similar to those in our hst sample , with similar results : about a third of the objects are found in strongly disturbed interacting systems , while the rest are found in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "we previously suggested that the difference in morphology may reflect the difference in the quasar fueling mechanisms as a function of quasar luminosity @xcite , but of course this interpretation is only tentative since the comparison samples were selected using very different methods . a detailed study of hosts of optically selected narrow - line quasars at lower luminosity is needed to understand the origin of the morphological difference .",
    "we have chosen to explore the host galaxy properties of obscured active galaxies in particular because of the increased contrast between galaxy and nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , it is our burden to determine whether or not our conclusions can be generalized to all accreting bhs at the epoch being probed . rather surprisingly , the distributions of bh mass and eddington ratio for our sample of narrow - line agns are quite similar to those seen in broad - line samples at similar luminosity and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this fact , combined with the observation of @xcite that the space densities of the broad- and narrow - line objects are comparable at fixed luminosity , suggest that the two may originate from similar populations .",
    "there is another aspect to the story , as illuminated by the differences in star - forming properties between the narrow- and broad - line objects .",
    "a variety of recent papers have devised clever techniques for disentangling photoionization by stellar and nonstellar sources using the line strengths of high- and low - ionization lines , where the former are certainly dominated by the agn but the latter can be significantly contaminated by star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these studies all come to the same conclusion ; star formation is more energetically significant in narrow - line than in broad - line agns , particularly at the luminous end ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the excess star formation in narrow - line objects has been interpreted as evidence for an evolutionary scenario , in which obscured accretion and ongoing star formation coexist , and then accretion terminates further star formation , yielding an unobscured object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture",
    "some event ( usually a merger ) induces both the star formation and nuclear activity , and the broad - line object signifies the final stage in the accretion cycle .",
    "perhaps , on the other hand , there is not necessarily a causal connection between the star formation event and the accretion event , but when both occur simultaneously the odds are higher that the accretion event will be obscured by star formation in the host galaxy @xcite . our data alone clearly can not distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "however , we do see a range of star formation properties across even this relatively small sample .",
    "naively , if there were truly a causal connection between star formation and nuclear activity , one would expect that the majority of our sample would show a clear sign of ongoing star formation , even if only in the form of post - starburst signatures .",
    "we look forward to analyzing the full @xcite sample to more definitively quantify the star formation properties as a function of agn luminosity @xcite .",
    "we have seen that luminous obscured active galaxies with @xmath137 and @xmath138  erg  s@xmath12 are composed of bhs with masses @xmath139  @xmath3  radiating at a high fraction of their eddington limits .",
    "we are seeing unambiguous evidence that bh accretion impacts the host on a galaxy - wide scale ; the host galaxy ism is clearly substantially disturbed relative to less active systems . as a result , we can not recommend the use of gas line widths as a substitute for stellar velocity dispersions at such high luminosities , at least not in obscured sources .",
    "there is a clear blue component in the galaxies , apparent both in the overall colors and in nuclear spectroscopy , and in most cases the blue light is consistent with being scattered emission from the obscured nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , nearly half of the sample shows evidence for recent or ongoing star formation , while the rest are consistent with predominantly old stellar populations .",
    "although star formation activity may rise with vigorous agn activity , there is a wide dispersion at all luminosities , suggesting that we are far from having a consistent picture of the coevolution of host galaxies and bh growth ."
