    "broad sio thermal line emission is known to be a good indicator of shocked gas in molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "the sio line profiles have typical linewidths of tens of km@xmath4s@xmath5 and appear shifted with respect to the ambient cloud velocity .",
    "in addition to this broad emission , @xcite and @xcite reported the detection of very narrow sio thermal lines ( linewidths of @xmath61@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 ) centered at almost ambient velocities toward the young ngc1333 and l1448-mm outflows .",

    "the increase in the sio flux toward condensations a , b and c are likely real and produced by an enhancement in the gas - phase abundance of sio by the recent interaction of young c - shocks with the ambient gas .",
    "the variable nature of the sio clumps d and e , however , remains unclear ( section@xmath4[mod ] ) .",
    "our results also reveal the detection in 2009 of several new narrow sio components that tend to be found at the interface between the sio condensations a , b , c , d and e reported at intermediate velocities toward the red - shifted lobe of the outflow ( section@xmath4[pre ] ) .",
    "we speculate that the recently detected narrow sio components are possibly associated with the magnetic precursor of c - shocks ( section@xmath4[origin ] ) .",

    "pdbi observations of the thermal sio @xmath7=0 @xmath2=2@xmath31 line emission ( at 86.846@xmath4ghz ) toward the l1448-mm outflow , were carried out in the b and c configurations in november 2004-february 2005 ( for @xmath815@xmath4hrs of on - source time ) and in the c configuration in march - april 2009 ( @xmath89@xmath4hrs ) .",

    "independent uv tables were generated for the 20@xmath4mhz and 80@xmath4mhz correlator units used in the observations .",
    "the uv data were resampled in velocity by imposing the same number of channels ( 460 and 230 for the 20@xmath4mhz and 80@xmath4mhz units , respectively ) , the same position for the central channel ( 230 for the 20@xmath4mhz unit , and 115 for the 80@xmath4mhz unit ) , lsr velocity of the source ( @xmath195@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 in all cases ) and channel spacing ( 39@xmath4khz or 0.14@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 for the 20@xmath4mhz unit , and 312@xmath4khz or 1.1@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 for the 80@xmath4mhz unit ) .      the sio emission toward the l1448-mm outflow is known to be detected to velocities up to @xmath2080@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 @xcite .",

    "in particular , since the configuration of the pdbi array in 2009 was more compact than in 2005 , the 2009 observations could have been more sensitive to extended emission introducing a low - level contribution that could have mimicked a time - variation in the flux and morphology of the sio emission . to avoid this potential problem ,",
    "we have homogenized the 2005 and 2009 datasets in the uv plane by selecting the _ common _ visibilities to both epochs contained within uv cells of 10@xmath4m - size .",
    "we created a mapping procedure that sets the weight of the _ non - overlapping _ visibilities to negative values so that these visibilities were flagged out and not considered in the subsequent steps for imaging .",
    "as shown below , this has the disadvantage to decrease the sensitivity of the original observations , but guarantees that any possible variation detected in the sio @xmath2=2@xmath31 line profile toward l1448-mm is not affected by differential missing flux due to different uv sampling in the two epochs .    the continuum uv tables were generated by considering the same line - free frequency ranges in both datasets . after selecting the common visibilities in both continuum uv tables , we subtracted the continuum uv data from the line+continuum uv tables for the 2005 and 2009 epochs by using the uvsubtract task within mapping .",

    "the stopping criteria for the clean task was met for every channel when the maximum amplitude of the absolute value of the residual image was lower than 2.5% the peak intensity of the dirty map .",
    "we note that this criterion is set up by default within the mapping software .",
    "the final analysis of the cleaned images was carried out with the new madcubaj software .",
    "an automatic data analysis procedure was applied to the uv data to calculate the visibility noise for every single channel in the uv tables . in table@xmath4[tab1 ] , we show the median values obtained from the histograms of the visibility noise per channel for the 80@xmath4mhz unit tables . the noise is almost a factor of 2 larger in the 2005 uv data ( @xmath823@xmath4mjy / beam per 312@xmath4khz - channel ) with respect to the 2009 dataset ( @xmath813@xmath4mjy / beam per 312@xmath4khz - channel ) .",

    "@xcite proposed another technique to measure very small changes in the structure of very bright radiocontinuum sources such as the planetary nebula ngc7027 .",
    "the cross - calibration method is based on the use of the closure phases and amplitudes derived from the data from epoch i , to minimize the effects of calibration errors on the final subtracted map .",

    "we note that , although the noise in the high - spectral resolution 20@xmath4mhz data is expected to be significantly worse than in the 80@xmath4mhz uv data , the 20@xmath4mhz data considers all visibilities available from the 2005 and 2009 observations , while the low - spectral resolution 80@xmath4mhz uv files have been constructed from only uv data common to both epochs .",

    "the increase of the sio emission flux at intermediate velocities in 2009 is also evident from the right panels of figure@xmath4[f1 ] , where we compare the sio spectra averaged within condensations a , b , c , d and e for the 2005 and 2009 observations , and smoothed to a velocity resolution of 2.2@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 .",

    "one may think that the increase in the sio flux measured in 2009 with respect to 2005 could be produced by an effect of differences in the data calibration process between both epochs . to check for this potential problem , in figure@xmath4[f3 ] we compare the images of the continuum emission at 87@xmath4ghz obtained in the 2005 and 2009 observations . if calibration effects were responsible for the sio flux increase , they should be apparent in the continuum images since the continuum emission flux is expected to remain constant with time . from figure@xmath4[f3",

    "the rms noise level in every image has been calculated from the thermal noise shown in table@xmath4[tab1 ] divided by @xmath22 with n the number of channels used to generate the averaged intensity map . for the m1 and m3 components , we consider as reference the rms noise measured in the 2005 observations ( i.e. 7.7@xmath4mjy / beam for m1 and 12.6@xmath4mjy / beam for m3 ) . for the m2 and m4 components , in general fainter than the m1 and m3 narrow emission , we have used the individual rms noise level obtained in every image ( for m2 , 8.9@xmath4mjy / beam and 7.6@xmath4mjy / beam in the 2005 and 2009 images , respectively ; and for m4 , 15.4@xmath4mjy / beam and 13.2@xmath4mjy / beam in the 2005 and 2009 maps ) .    from figure@xmath4[f5 ]",
    ", we find that the narrow sio emission at 5.2@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 ( i.e. the m1 component ) with a linewidth of only @xmath80.4@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 , is the only component clearly detected in both epochs .",
    "this emission , previously reported by @xcite from single - dish iram 30@xmath4 m observations , was interpreted as the signature of the magnetic precursor of young c - shocks toward the l1448-mm outflow .",
    "the m1 emission peaks at ( -2,-7 ) , and although compact , shows an elongation in the direction perpendicular to the high - velocity jet ( size of @xmath84@xmath0@xmath16@xmath0 , 0.005@xmath4pc@xmath10.007@xmath4pc ) .",
    "we note that this emission falls to the north of the secondary co @xmath2=3@xmath32 outflow reported by @xcite and powered by the south - eastern source l1448-c(s ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the narrow sio kinematics do not exactly match those of the co @xmath2=3@xmath32 emission , suggesting that the m1 emission is not associated with this secondary outflow .    from the averaged sio spectra of figure@xmath4[f5 ]",
    "( right panels ) , the derived sio integrated flux for m1 in the 2009 spectrum is slightly brighter than in the 2005 data by 20%@xmath2013% .",
    "the error in the relative difference of the sio flux is large .",
    "however , as shown in section@xmath4[mod ] , the flux increase by 20% should be considered as a lower limit since the continuum peak intensity in the 2009 images is weaker than in 2005 . therefore , it is possible that the narrow sio emission arising from m1 is also variable .",
    "in contrast with m1 , the other three narrow sio components ( m2 , m3 and m4 ) seem to be associated with transient structures that appear either in the 2005 or 2009 images .",
    "for instance , for the m2 narrow emission at 6.5@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 , one condensation is found toward clump b in the 2005 map , while two new m2 condensations appear associated with clumps c and with the south - east edge of condensation d. from the sio spectra averaged over these new condensations ( figure@xmath4[f5 ] ) , we find that the sio line profiles seem to have evolved since 2005 because their emission peaks appear more red - shifted within the shock , and their line wings are slightly brighter at velocities ranging from 7 to 10@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the m2 condensation toward d is particularly interesting because it also shows an elongation in the direction perpendicular to the jet , as if tracing the interface between the recently shocked gas of clumps d and e.    we note that the detection of the m2 emission components in 2009 could be a direct consequence of the higher sensitivity of the 2009 images .",
    "however , no similar structure is seen in the 2005 map above the 2@xmath21 level ( 17.8@xmath4mjy / beam ; left panel of figure@xmath4[f5 ] ) , which is below the 3@xmath21 noise level ( of 22.8@xmath4mjy ) of the 2009 image .",
    "this suggests that the m2 narrow sio lines , with linewidths of 0.7@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 , were likely not present in 2005 .",
    "the m3 and m4 narrow sio components ( see figure@xmath4[f6 ] ) have linewidths of @xmath80.25 - 0.6@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 and their morphology is more compact ( sizes of @xmath64@xmath0 ) .",
    "the m3 and m4 clumps are found toward a and b , likely forming part of a larger c - shock structure ( left panels of figure@xmath4[f6 ] ) . the m3 emission seen at the interface between clumps d and e in 2005 seems to have vanished in the 2009 image , revealing the transient nature of the precursor phenomenon .",
    "it is remarkable that the m4 clump close to the l1448-mm protostar is relatively bright ( peak intensity of @xmath80.05@xmath4jy / beam ) but remains unresolved in the 2009 images .",
    "this implies that the magnetic precursor region toward this component is smaller than @xmath83.5@xmath0 ( 0.004@xmath4pc ) .",

    "variability of the atomic / molecular emission toward molecular outflows have usually focused on the detection of proper motions associated with the high - velocity shocked gas in these objects @xcite .",
    "however , it has usually been neglected that the moderate- and intermediate - velocity shocked gas generated in c - shocks , could also be subject to changes in the line emission arising from these regions .",
    "our data show that the sio emission at intermediate velocities toward the red - shifted lobe of the l1448-mm outflow has changed in morphology , line intensity , and line shape in only 4@xmath4yrs .",
    "this is particularly true for condensations a , b and c , where their measured sio flux increase by factors 1.4 - 3 can not be attributed to systematic differences between the beams of the observations ( section@xmath4[mod ] ) .",
    "this flux increase suggests that new material has likely entered the shock , enhancing the gas - phase abundance of sio toward these regions .",
    "the lack of detection of sio in previous interferometric observations toward the location of the new sio condensations @xcite , also favours the idea of a recent sio enhancement toward the red - shifted lobe of the l1448-mm outflow .",
    "although not predicted by the models of @xcite for such short time - scales , the sio line profiles could also be variable at high velocities with a moderate increase in their integrated intensity flux .",
    "the origin for such a coherent variability in the sio emission over spatial scales of 750 - 1000@xmath4au ( i.e. over the 30 - 40@xmath16 mapped with the pdbi toward the red - shifted lobe of the l1448-mm outflow ) could be related to the formation of c - shocks in the internal working surface between the high - velocity jet and the ambient material .",
    "these shocks would tend to propagate sideways and would participate in the expansion processes associated with the high - velocity jet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as shown by the extended sio and h@xmath34 shock - excited emission reported by @xcite and @xcite , the l1448-mm jet has already travelled along distances larger than @xmath332@xmath15 , explaining the coverage of at least 30 - 40@xmath16 where variability of the sio emission has been detected . in section@xmath4[mod ] , we have shown that the deconvolved size of the b , c , d and e condensations in the direction perpendicular to the high - velocity jet is @xmath61.8@xmath16 ( i.e. 0.002@xmath4pc at a distance of 250@xmath4pc ) . assuming that c - shocks generated at the working surface travel symmetricaly and sideways half that distance from the jet , we estimate a propagation velocity for those c - shocks of @xmath6240@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 in the 4@xmath4yrs time - interval between the 2005 and 2009 observations .",
    "these velocities are consistent with those derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* of few hundred km@xmath4s@xmath5 ) from the proper motions of the sio high - velocity bullets observed toward the red - shifted lobe of the l1448-mm outflow .",
    "we would like to stress that the presence of c - shocks with such high velocities could be possible within an scenario of a highly magnetized medium with a large pre - shock magnetic induction , @xmath35 , transverse to the direction of the flow .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that , for large values of @xmath35 ( of the order of some mg ) , the critical velocities of c - shocks can be as high as few 100@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 , which are similar to those derived from our observations .    the variability of the thermal sio emission toward l1448-mm is also supported by our high - spectral resolution sio data , which show regions ( the m2 precursor component ) where the narrow sio line profiles seem to have evolved since 2005 .",
    "the emission peak of these lines have been red - shifted within the shock , and have developed slightly brighter broad sio emission as predicted by shock models @xcite .",
    "although the broad sio condensation e falls outside the primary beam of our observations , this trend in the evolution of the sio line profile since 2005 is also found toward this condensation .",
    "the narrow sio emission toward the m1 component also seems to have experienced a small increase in its integrated intensity flux ( by 20@xmath2013% ) .",
    "this component , previously reported by single - dish observations @xcite , is known to be correlated with an enhancement and over - excitation of the ion fluid ( represented by the h@xmath36co@xmath37 molecule ) with respect to the neutral one ( with molecules such as hn@xmath36c and h@xmath36cn ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected within the magnetic precursor scenario .",
    "however , although predicted by our c - shock modelling results @xcite , no significant variation in the linewidth of narrow sio is detected for the m1 component toward the l1448-mm outflow .",
    "the other narrow sio components ( m2 , m3 and m4 ) are fainter and their linewidths are as narrow as @xmath80.25@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 . even in the case that no turbulence was present in the medium , these linewidths would imply a kinetic temperature of @xmath660@xmath4k for the sio gas , which could only be attained at the early precursor stage or at the evolved postshock gas ( see e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since these components seem to be transient ( section@xmath4[pre ] )",
    ", it is likely that they arise from the precursor region of the shock .",
    "reflected shock waves within the postshock gas could not be responsible for the narrow sio lines in this outflow , because their ion - neutral velocity drift never exceeds 6@xmath4km@xmath4s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is the lower limit drift velocity required to sputter detectable abundances of sio in the gas - phase , from the mantles of dust grains @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the m2 emitting regions appears elongated in the direction perpendicular to the high - velocity jet , resembling the bow - shock structures observed toward other jets and outflows ( e.g. as in hh1 - 2 or orion ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , these regions remain practically unresolved in the direction of the jet ( @xmath64@xmath0 , 1.5 - 1.8@xmath110@xmath38@xmath4 cm ; section@xmath4[pre ] ) , and are generally found at the interface between the recently shocked condensations a , b , c , d and e detected at intermediate velocities in the 2009 maps .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the m4 narrow sio line arises from unresolved regions ( section@xmath4[pre ] ) .",
    "we note that , although we compare our results with those from steady - state c - shock models , recent modeling of the transient evolution of c - shocks predict the presence of a magnetic precursor within the physical structure of the shock , as a consequence of its propagation through a decreasing density medium such as that found in molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we present interferometric images of the thermal emission of the sio @xmath2=2@xmath31 rotational line observed toward the l1448-mm outflow at two different epochs ( 2005 and 2009 ) .",

    "not only the morphology of the sio emission , but also its line profiles , have significantly changed since 2005 , with a clear increase of the sio flux at intermediate - velocities , and possibly at high - velocities .",
