    "interaction of @xmath0 two - level atoms with a quantized electromagnetic field , using dipolar and rotating wave approximations , is described by the _ tavis - cummings model _ @xcite , having an extensive use in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "recently this model has been physically realized using a qed cavity with bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting has been the investigation of the phase transitions of the system in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , and at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the system of three - level atoms interacting with a one mode radiation field together with a dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms has been studied to determine the atomic squeezing  @xcite .",
    "they consider @xmath1 and @xmath2 configurations under initial conditions of the matter and field parts associated to @xmath8 and heisenberg - weyl coherent states , respectively .",
    "spin variances for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 configurations of an ensemble of atoms interacting with two light fields , a coherent pump state and a squeezed vacuum as a probe , have been calculated by means of the langevin equations derived from the bloch equations  @xcite . by using a holstein - primakoff mapping , two stable states , normal and superradiant ( the latter in two colors ) ,",
    "have been identified in the thermodynamic limit for the @xmath2 configuration  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have analytically obtained the localization of the quantum phase transitions from the normal to the collective regimes for three - level atoms interacting with a one - mode field for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 configurations , in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "these transitions appear in the ground state energy surface @xmath9 and the corresponding total number of excitations @xmath10 , when plotted as functions of their corresponding dipole coupling constants ( control parameters ) , calculated using as test function the direct product of the heisenberg - weyl ( field contribution ) and gelfand - tsetlin ( matter contribution ) coherent states .",
    "we found that the agreement of these quantities with the corresponding exact quantum calculations ( namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) is remarkable  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we determine explicitly the order of the quantum phase transitions , and calculate the mandel parameter of the @xmath6 distribution function and of the photon number distribution function of the ground state of the system .",
    "we find that first- and second - order transitions appear for atoms in the @xmath1 configuration , and only second - order transitions appear for atoms in the @xmath3 configuration .",
    "atoms in the @xmath2 configuration , depending of the detuning parameter , mimic the behavior of the @xmath1 or the @xmath3 configuration .",
    "we find that in the collective regime , i.e. , where the ground state possesses @xmath13 , the state obeys sub - poissonian statistics while in the normal regime it satisfies poissonian statistics .    while both , the total number of excitations @xmath6 and the expectation value of the number of photons @xmath14 , are in agreement with their corresponding exact quantum calculation , we find that their fluctuations are not .",
    "this is because the semi - classical ground state has the contribution of an infinite number of photons in a poissonian distribution .",

    "we provide an exact expression to evaluate the first order derivatives of the ground state energy surface ( as a function of the control parameters ) , so that the first - order transitions for each atomic configuration can be calculated in analytical form . for every value of the total number of excitations , the corresponding mandel parameter of the semi - classical ground state , providing the kind of statistics that it satisfies , is evaluated in [ fluc ] . in [ numerical.results ]",

    "the second term in the rhs of equation ( [ eq.hint.1.full ] ) corresponds to the counter - rotating term , and when rwa approximation is considered this term is neglected .",
