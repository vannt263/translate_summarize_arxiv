    "the quantitative analysis of spectroscopic data from observations demands knowledge of the instrument profile of the spectrographic tools used for data acquisition .",
    "the instrument profile determines the spectral resolution of the observations , which ultimately affects the sensitivity of measurements of physically relevant plasma quantities , such as line widths ( e.g. , radiative , collisional , thermal , plasma turbulence ) , line shifts ( e.g. , isotopic , doppler , gravitational ) , and spectral modulations in both intensity and polarization ( e.g. , zeeman and stark splitting by applied fields , spectral line polarization in anisotropic media , redistribution of radiation frequency in partially coherent scattering ) .",
    "in particular , the instrument profile of a slit - based spectrograph , also called the _ line spread function _ ( lsf ) , depends on the aperture of the entrance slit , the _ finesse _ of the spectral profile of the dispersive element ( e.g. , prism , diffraction grating ) , and the sampling length of the imaged spectrum at the detector ( e.g. , the pixel size of a ccd camera , or the average size of film grains ) .",
    "often , for computational convenience , the simplistic assumption is made that the width of the instrument profile ( typically , its _ full width at half maximum _ , fwhm ) can be calculated as the _ root - sum - square _ ( rss ) of the individual contributions from the slit , the chromatic dispersion profile , and the detector s sampling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation is of course based on the assumption that the profiles associated with each of these contributions can be represented by gaussian distributions , and that there are no inter - dependences among those contributions .",
    "while this assumption may turn out to be valid in some particular configurations of a slit - based spectrograph , it is not representative of the general dispersive and imaging properties of a given instrument . in particular",
    ", this approximation can not properly account for the different diffraction conditions that the experimenter encounters when exploring a very large interval of wavelengths  say , from the extreme blue to the near infrared  while using a fixed aperture of the slit .",
    "it also fails to reproduce the different sampling regimes at the detector that necessarily occur in such multi - wavelength usage of the spectrograph , and which may not correspond exactly to the desired sampling condition ( e.g. , pixel matching , nyquist sampling ) .",
    "layout of the imaging system .",
    "see text for details . ]    in this note , we investigate the diffraction properties of a spectrograph in order to arrive at a general expression for the lsf , and ultimately to an analytic approximation to the spectral resolution of the instrument . obviously , we must rely on the fourier analysis of the instrument s components .",
    "the problem is not new , and in fact we re - derive known results that date at least as far back as wadsworth s extensive investigation of the effects of the slit aperture on the shape of spectral lines @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , for our treatment of the problem , we adopted the tools of the operational calculus of fourier optics ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , which lead to a very general and compact description of the _ optical transfer operator _ ( oto ) of a slit spectrograph , opening the ground for further investigations of the performance of such instruments under different illumination conditions , through both analytic and numerical approaches .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] we derive the general lsf of a slit spectrograph under the hypothesis of coherent illumination , and obtain a closed analytic form for the case where the grating defines the limiting aperture of the system .",
    "we then show how this approach immediately leads to the expression of the lsf in the case of incoherent illumination . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : resolution ] we propose a functional form for the fwhm of the instrument profile after sampling by the detector , for the purpose of estimating the spectral resolution of the instrument .",
    "we consider a slit spectrograph ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ) , consisting of a slit ( @xmath0 ) , a collimator lens ( @xmath1 ) , a grating ( @xmath2 ) , a camera lens ( @xmath3 ) , and a detector ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we assume that the spectrograph can be described operationally as a linear system @xmath5 acting on the input field @xmath6 at the slit , and producing an output field @xmath7 at the detector , so that @xmath8 .",
    "the oto for such a system , assumed to be perfectly stigmatic ( i.e. , free of optical aberrations ) , takes the form ( see @xcite , and the appendix ) @xmath9 here the operator @xmath10 describes the wavefront modification introduced by a powered optic of focal length @xmath11 , whereas @xmath12 describes the free - space propagation of the wavefront along the optical path of length @xmath13 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : oto ] ) does not take into account the presence of beam - limiting apertures along the optical path .",
    "the location of those apertures is marked by the presence of the unit operator .",
    "we want to determine the instrument profile ( or lsf ) for a given wavelength , @xmath14 . using the transformation rules of the operational calculus of fourier optics ( see appendix ) , and introducing the dimensional constant @xmath15",
    ", we find , apart from a constant phase factor , @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the operation of fourier transform , and @xmath18 is the scaling operator by the quantity @xmath19 ( see appendix ) .    in order to develop the oto expression beyond the general form of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we need to make some assumptions on the transmission functions of the various apertures .",
    "first of all , we will assume that the camera lens , @xmath3 , is sized such as not to introduce any vignetting of the beam after the collimator lens and the grating .",
    "in such cases , we can assume that the diameter of the camera lens is virtually infinite , and noting that @xmath20 , we can rewrite , @xmath21 in fact , because the beam between @xmath1 and @xmath3 is collimated , we can safely assume that the vignetting of the beam is produced only by the smallest size aperture in the collimator .",

    "the final phase factor again is inessential for the determination of the spectrograph s lsf .",
    "in fact , this phase factor could effectively be reduced to 1 as well , although the necessary condition @xmath30 may be hard to meet in realistic spectrograph designs , because @xmath31 must be subject to the constraint of the spatial / spectral sampling requirement , and thus it is driven by the pixel size of the detector .",

    "( [ eq : spectral_resol ] ) and ( [ eq : disper ] ) we find instead that the expression for the spectral resolution has the general form @xmath146 _ for all regimes _ of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
