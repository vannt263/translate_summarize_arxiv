    "the dynamics of pure and doped helium ( he ) nanodroplets induced by laser excitation is currently being studied both experimentally and theoretically by various groups  @xcite .",
    "the goal is to better understand the dynamic response of a microscopic superfluid to an impulsive perturbation .",
    "furthermore , dopant atoms and molecules embedded in he nanodroplets exhibit various peculiar dynamical phenomena upon electronic excitation or ionization such as solvation into or desolvation out of the droplets  @xcite , complex formation of dopants with he atoms  @xcite , or the light - induced collapse of metastable structures formed by aggregation in droplets  @xcite .",
    "recently , the time - resolved study of rotational wave packet motion of molecules embedded in he droplets revealed that molecular rotation is significantly slowed down compared to isolated molecules and that rotational recurrences were completely absent  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to our previous observation of long - lasting coherent vibrational motion of na@xmath0 , k@xmath0 , rb@xmath0 , and rb@xmath4 molecules formed on the surface of he droplets  @xcite which we interpreted in terms of weak system - bath couplings  @xcite .",
    "however , no clear signature of the desorption process of rb@xmath0 off the droplet surface was seen so that some uncertainty has remained with regard to the location of the molecule after excitation  on the droplet surface or in the vacuum .    in the present work we report on an ion imaging study of the desorption dynamics of rb@xmath0 molecules formed on the surface of he nanodroplets .",
    "this work extends previous experimental studies of the desorption process of alkali ( ak ) metal atoms on the one hand  @xcite , and on of the vibrational wavepacket dynamics of ak dimers and trimers formed on he droplets on the other  @xcite .",
    "ak metals are particularly well - suited for these studies due to their location in shallow dimple states at the droplet surface  @xcite . upon electronic excitation , ak metal atoms and molecules tend to desorb off the he droplet as a consequence of repulsive interaction caused by the overlap of their extended valence orbitals with the surrounding he  @xcite .",
    "the only known exceptions are rb and cs atoms excited to their lowest excited states  @xcite .",
    "ions of ak metals , in contrast , tend to be submerged in the he droplet interior where they form stable akhe@xmath5 ` snowball ' complexes due to strong attractive polarization forces  @xcite .",
    "thus , in femtosecond ( fs ) pump - probe experiments , where a first pump pulse excites the ak atom and a second probe pulse ionizes it , the competing dynamics of desorption of the excited ak atom versus the fall - back of the atom into the droplet upon ionization can be followed in real - time  @xcite .    for low - lying excited states , the dynamics of the desorption process",
    "is well described by the pseudo - diatomic model which treats the whole he droplet , he@xmath2 , as one constituent atom of the akhe@xmath2 pseudodiatomic molecule  @xcite .",
    "this approach provides a reasonably precise assignment of the spectral features in absorption spectra of the akhe@xmath2 complex  @xcite , rationalizes kinetic energies of desorbed ak atoms , and explains the angular distributions of desorbed ak atoms in terms of the symmetries of ground and excited pseudo - diatomic molecular states  @xcite . moreover , fs pump - probe transients revealing the desorption dynamics of ak atoms are reasonably well interpreted using the pseudo - diatomic model  @xcite .    for ak dimers , trimers and larger ak@xmath5 oligomers attached to he",
    "droplets the dynamics induced by electronic excitation is not as well established as for single atoms . on the one hand ,",
    "pauli repulsion resulting from the overlapping of a diffuse excited state - electron distribution with the surrounding he tends to be weaker for large molecules and clusters because the relative change of orbital radius upon electronic excitation generally is smaller than for single atoms excited in a similar energy range .",
    "besides , larger clusters are more stably bound to the he droplet with increasing cluster size as a result of attractive dispersion forces  @xcite .",
    "note that polyatomic molecules generally remain attached to he nanodroplets upon electronic excitation into low - lying excited states  @xcite .",
    "thus , the desorption probability tends to be reduced for larger ak metal clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the increasing density of internal states may enhance slow evaporation of ak@xmath5 following excitation due to energy redistribution from intra - cluster ( ak@xmath5 ) to inter - cluster ( ak@xmath5-he@xmath2 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the present work clearly shows that rb@xmath0 molecules desorb off the surface of he nanodroplets when excited into intermediate electronic states .",
    "however , the desorption dynamics is more intricate than in the case of ak atoms and appears to be most crucially determined by the rb@xmath0 molecular states rather than by coupled states of the rb@xmath0he@xmath2 complex as for he droplets doped with single ak atoms .",
    "the experiments presented here are performed using the same setup as described previously  @xcite . in short ,",
    "a continuous beam of he nanodroplets with a mean size of about 20,000 he atoms per droplet is produced by a continuous expansion of he out of a cryogenic nozzle ( @xmath6 k ) with a diameter of @xmath7 m  @xcite .",
    "the resulting average droplet size is about 20,000 he atoms per droplet .",
    "an adjacent vacuum chamber contains a vapor cell filled with bulk metallic rb heated to around 100@xmath8c to achieve the maximum signal of rb@xmath1 dimer ions while keeping larger oligomer masses below the detection limit . under these conditions he droplets",
    "are doped with two rb atoms which subsequently form rb@xmath0 molecules on he droplets .",
    "the released binding energy of the molecules is dissipated by evaporation of he atoms from the droplets . in this formation process by trend ak molecules in the more loosely bound triplet metastable state remain attached to the droplets .",
    "however , for larger he droplets as we use in this study , substantial amounts of ak molecules in their singlet groundstate and even small clusters in low - spin states are also being formed on the droplets  @xcite .    in the detector chamber",
    "further downstream , the doped he droplet beam intersects at right angles the beam of either a tunable dye laser ( sirah cobra , pulse length @xmath9ns , pulse energy @xmath10j , repetition rate @xmath11khz , focal length of the focusing lens @xmath12  cm ) using coumarine 102 and exalite 411 or that of a fs laser ( coherent legend , pulse length @xmath13fs , pulse energy @xmath14j , repetition rate @xmath15khz , @xmath16 cm for both pump and probe ) .",

    "however , the measured peak is slightly red - shifted by 170 and 300  @xmath22  , respectively , compared to the computed profiles .",
    "note that absorption features of intermediate excited states of other ak atoms attached to he droplets have also been found to be shifted in the same range of wavenumbers with respect to simple model calculations  @xcite .",
    "most likely reasons for this deviation which are hard to quantify are inhomogeneous broadenings due to droplet size - dependent line shifts in combination with a broad droplet size distribution as well as due to local fluctuations of the he density around the dopant  @xcite . besides , the accuracy of potential curves of such intermediate levels of excitation may be an issue . the left wing of the feature around 23800  @xmath22  overlaps with the right wing of the fcf contour of the @xmath46-state . at higher photon energies the feature reaches out to the fcf contours of the @xmath47-states .",

    "we mention that similar finite velocity values at short delay are also observed in for rb@xmath3 and rbhe@xmath3 ion in experiments where the he droplets are doped with single rb atoms .",
    "this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .    with increasing delay the velocity shifts to higher values till it reaches 90@xmath87 of the asymptotic value of 179.6(5 )",
    "m / s at a delay of @xmath88  ps .",
    "this monotonous increase in velocity directly reflects the dynamics of desorption of excited rb@xmath0 molecules off the he surface .",
    "as expected , at long delay times the velocity map ion images converge towards those measured using the ns laser within the experimental uncertainty . from fitting an exponential function @xmath89 to the data",
    "we obtain a characteristic time constant for the desorption process @xmath90  ps .",
    "note that this value exceeds the rb@xmath0 fall - back time derived from the ion yield measurement .",
    "the difference between ion yield and velocity transients is attributed to the more extended range of repulsive interaction of the excited rb@xmath0 molecule as compared to the range of attraction of the rb@xmath1 ion towards the he droplet . as a consequence",
    ", the excited rb@xmath0 continues to be accelerated away from the droplet surface even beyond the fall - back time .",
    "the time evolution of the anisotropy parameter @xmath49 is shown as red symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppspeed ] .",
    "it only slightly varies between @xmath91 at short delays and @xmath92 at long delays .",
    "the latter value falls slightly below the value measured with the ns laser ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is likely due to the excitation of a superposition of states of opposing symmetry by the broad - band fs laser where the @xmath20-component dominates .",
    "molecules in the singlet ( left ) and triplet ( right ) groundstates attached to he droplets and the corresponding angular distributions upon desorption .",
    "vector @xmath94 indicates the direction of laser polarization and @xmath95 is the transition dipole moment .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      first of all we point out that our time- and velocity - resolved measurements confirm our conception of prompt , pseudo - diatomic dissociation of the rb@xmath0he@xmath2 complex as discussed above in the context of our ns experiments .",
    "the observed pump - probe delay - dependent dynamics clearly shows that in the studied energy range one - photon vibronic excitation of neutral rb@xmath0 dimers induces an accelerated , directed motion of the rb@xmath0 away from the droplet surface during a few ps .",
    "based on these experimental findings we suggest the following general scheme for the desorption process of rb@xmath0 diatomic molecules from the surface of he droplets .",
    "the argumentation most likely holds for other ak metal dimers as well .",
    "the central assumption is that the quantization axis which determines the symmetry of the molecular state and thus the direction of the transition dipole moment is determined by the molecular axis of the rb@xmath0 dopant .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the excitation is mostly centered on the rb@xmath0 due to droplet excitations falling into very different ranges of energy as compared to those of the rb@xmath0 molecules .",
    "furthermore , the excited states are governed by the generally much stronger intramolecular interactions ( @xmath96-@xmath97  @xmath22 ) as compared to the interaction of the rb@xmath0 dimer with the he droplet ( @xmath66-@xmath98  @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , for the singlet groundstate where the rb@xmath0 stands perpendicular on the he droplet surface  @xcite , the angular distribution of rb@xmath0 `` fragments '' coincides with that of rb atomic fragments for the hypothetical case that free rb@xmath0 molecules were excited into dissociative states of the same symmetry .",
    "this situation is schematically sketched on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "in contrast , the lowest triplet state of rb@xmath0 would result in an angular distribution of desorbed rb@xmath0 molecules of the opposite anisotropy as compared to the singlet groundstate .",
    "that is , counter - intuitively , @xmath50 would correspond to the _ perpendicular _ transition @xmath52 , as shown on the right hand side of fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] . unfortunately this conjecture can not be directly assessed with the data measured in this work .",
    "however , in future experiments we will check this situation by exciting better isolated , low - lying triplet states of ak dimers as we have done before  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the angular distributions , the internal states of the rb@xmath0 molecule appear to govern the kinetic energy released into the translational degree of freedom of the desorbing rb@xmath0 off the droplet surface through efficient coupling between intramolecular vibration and rb@xmath0-he@xmath2 relative motion .",
    "the observed desorption timescale of a few picoseconds being in the same range as the vibrational periods of the rb@xmath0 dimer states is in agreement with this conclusion .",
    "in contrast , previous experiments indicated that rb@xmath0 dimers remain attached to the droplet after excitation to the lowest lying triplet state even for high vibrational states@xcite .",
    "thus , we argue that the desorption probability most strongly depends on the electronic state",
    ". the analysis of time - resolved imaging experiments with rb atoms attached to he droplets excited to different electronic states will further clarify this issue .",
    "the present study clearly demonstrates that rb@xmath0 dimers formed on the surface of he nanodroplets promptly desorb off the surface upon electronic excitation into intermediate states , similarly to rb and other alkali metal dopant atoms .",
    "however , in contrast to rb atoms , the angular distribution of detected molecular ions is not determined by the symmetry of the dopant - droplet complex , but rather by the symmetry of the internal molecular states of the rb@xmath0 dopant .",
    "the latter remains weakly perturbed due to the relatively weak ak - he coupling .",
    "we conclude that this leads to opposite anisotropies of the angular distributions of desorbed rb@xmath0 formed in the singlet and triplet groundstates when driving transitions of the same symmetry .",
    "likewise , the kinetic energy distributions of desorbed rb@xmath0 appear to be mostly determined by the internal energy of rb@xmath0 which is converted into kinetic energy released into the translational motion of the desorbing rb@xmath0 .",
    "this is enabled by efficient he droplet - induced vibrational relaxation and coupling of intra and inter - molecular degrees of freedom of the rb@xmath0he@xmath2 complex . therefore the resulting multi - peaked structures of kinetic energy distributions elude from a simple interpretation in terms of pseudo - diatomic dissociation as in the case of ak metal atoms on he droplets .",
    "femtosecond time - resolved measurements of rb@xmath99 ion yields and velocities reveal qualitatively the same transient dynamics as rb atoms , which is determined by the competition of repulsion of the excited dopant away from the droplet surface and attraction of the dopant towards the droplet once ionized .",
    "however , this desorption dynamics proceeds more slowly for rb@xmath0 dimers as for rb atoms at the probed laser wavelength pointing at a weaker repulsion of excited rb@xmath0 than of excited rb . in future experiments",
    "we will refine this study by probing ak metal dimers in better defined singlet as well as triplet states .",
    "moreover , time - resolved imaging spectroscopy of ak metal trimers  @xcite and larger clusters  @xcite will shed new light on both the dynamics of intra - cluster degrees of freedom as well as the complex cluster - he droplet couplings .",
