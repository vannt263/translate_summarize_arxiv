    "* v96 ) survey of the original network synthesis localization ( nsl ) of sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite found a pair of nearly identical m5 supergiant stars , separated by 3.3 arcsec , and at an estimated distance of 12 - 15 kpc . while just outside of the original nsl , they lie within the rosat hri localization of the quiescent x  ray source rx  j190717 + 0919.3 thought to be associated with sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite . on the basis of the small probability that even one supergiant would lie within the rosat error circle and that at least one other supergiant had been associated with an sgr ( 180620 ; @xcite ) , v96 proposed that the m star pair may be associated with the sgr 1900 + 14 source .",
    "the position of the m star pair has continued to be consistent with more recent x  ray and gamma  ray observations which , taken together , have narrowed considerably the actual location of sgr 1900 + 14 from the original nsl area of 5 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "these recent x  ray and gamma  ray observations have also detected variations with a period of 5.16 sec @xcite and a deceleration of @xmath2  sec / sec .",
    "taken together , these are interpreted as evidence that the sgr source is a magnetar , though there remains some uncertainty in this interpretation @xcite .",
    "additionally , a variable and fading radio source was detected shortly after the 27 august sgr 1900 + 14 superburst by @xcite , providing strong evidence that it was the radio counterpart to the sgr .",
    "its subarcsec accurate position is located only a few arcseconds from the m stars .",
    "these positional coincidences , the lack of a plerionic radio source , and , despite arguments for snr g42.8 + 0.6 in the literature , the lack of a coincident supernova remnant , suggest that the system of proximate , high ",
    "mass m stars should not yet be dismissed as an evolutionary companion to the pulsating x  ray source associated with the sgr .    finding direct evidence that the m star pair may be associated with sgr 1900 + 14",
    "has proven elusive as summarized by @xcite .",
    "also difficult is a theoretical understanding of how isolated , albeit high mass , stars could play a role in the formation of a pulsating x  ray source , despite the presence of a high mass luminous blue variable ( lbv ) very near the sgr 180620 localization position , a remarkably similar situation to that for sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "recent near and mid  infrared observations of sgr 180620 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* f99 ) , however , have revealed the lbv to be only the most luminous member of a compact cluster of massive stars .",
    "such proximate regions of recent star formation provide a natural location for the birth of such pulsating x  ray sources , which can not be very old , without the need for invoking enormous space velocities from the nearest supernova remnants .",
    "in this paper we present evidence for a similar compact cluster of high - mass stars which has heretofore been hidden in the glare of its brightest components , the pair of m5 supergiant stars .",
    "the 1998 outburst season of sgr 1900 + 14 presented an opportunity to search for optical and near - infrared variability of the double m stars , or other sources within the rosat hri error circle , which might be correlated to the sgr outbursts via some process such as mass transfer to a compact object .",
    "beginning in early may and continuing through mid ",
    "july 1998 we carried out an i and j  band monitoring campaign at the u.s .",
    "naval observatory , flagstaff station ( nofs ) which eventually comprised 2025 short exposure frames of data with 54,460 seconds of open shutter time during 16 nights , intended to sample variability timescales down to a few seconds . the results of this work found no variablity for any object within the rosat hri error circle and are presented more fully in @xcite .    however , it was recognized that the numerous short i  band exposures constituted several hours of total exposure time , which could be stacked to form a deep i  band image to search for a counterpart at the position of the @xcite variable radio source . to the 1998 data were added additional short exposure frames from 1995 and 1999 . in all , 217 frames of individual exposure time between 1 and 10 minutes were coadded to form a net image of about 6.5 hours total exposure .",
    "all frames were obtained with one of two tektronix 2k ccds on the 1.55m strand astrometric telescope at the usnofs .",
    "it was additionally recognized that , since the exposures used were short enough not to saturate the three bright m stars ( a , b , and c of v96 ) , their light could largely be removed by psf subtraction .",
    "figure  1 is an approximately 45 x 45 arcsec portion of the median  filtered composite i  band image centered on the v96 m stars , with a limiting detection magnitude of i  @xmath0  26.5 . in this image",
    "the m stars abc have been removed , although their positions are still apparent due to imperfect subtraction .",
    "the position of the variable radio source is shown , but no counterpart is visible to i  @xmath0  26.5 , which is consistent with the non - detections in the near infrared of @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", none of the nearly 200 frames from 1998 were obtained simultaneously with a gamma  ray burst from sgr 1900 + 14 .    of greater interest",
    "is that the subtracted i  band image shows what appears to be a cluster of stars , and possibly nebulosity , centered on the position of the m stars .",
    "the iras source found at this location by @xcite shows a steeply rising energy spectrum that can be interpreted as warm dust in the cluster region .",
    "figure  1 also shows identification numbers of the possible cluster stars . on ut 1999 october 28",
    "we used the astrocam ir imager , which employs an sbrc 1024@xmath1 insb detector , at the 1.55m telescope to obtain a 1600 second net exposure j  band image of this region .",
    "an approximately 45 x 45 arcsec region of this image is shown in figure  2 , where again the m stars were somewhat successfully psf  subtracted .",
    "we obtained photometry for the cluster stars from the i and j  band frames , calibrated with several i and j  band local standards which had previously been set up for our variability monitoring program .",
    "the photometric results are presented in table  1 where the results for stars 5 and 6 are presented together as they could not be separated in the j  band observations .",
    "the observed ( i  j )  @xmath0  7 colors are far larger than for any unreddened star and indicate that they suffer extremely high extinction .",
    "assuming that the cluster stars are at the same distance and suffer the same extinction as the m supergiant stars ( 12 - 15 kpc ; a@xmath3  =  19.2@xmath41.0 ; v96 ) we placed all stars in an @xmath5 vs. ( i  j ) cm diagram ( figure  3 ) , assuming normal interstellar extinction @xcite , and where the error bars include the ranges in distance and a@xmath3 values given above .",
    "the solid curves show the approximate loci for supergiants and dwarfs later than a0 and for giants later than g0 while the dashed lines show the m0 ( i  j ) colors , for reference .",
    "the large uncertainty of the intrinsic ( i  j ) colors of the stars after subtracting a huge baseline of extinction renders them essentially useless in estimating their spectral types .",
    "however , at this assumed distance and extinction the stars have luminosities far greater than that of main sequence stars .",
    "we note that even assuming the stars are at a much closer distance ( for instance d  @xmath0  5 kpc as has often been quoted by association with the snr g42.8 + 0.6 ) has little affect on the conclusion that these are highly luminous stars .",
    "several examples of compact high mass young clusters serve as templates for these objects : ngc 3603 @xcite , w43 @xcite , and several clusters summarized in @xcite .",
    "these clusters are characterized by 10  30 cluster members , radii of 0.2  1.0 pc , and ages of 1  10 myr .",
    "the sgr 1900 + 14 cluster has at least 13 members ( including stars a and b ) and an approximate 7 arcsec radius which , at a distance of 12  15 kpc , corresponds to a cluster radius of @xmath0 0.4 pc .",
    "a remarkably similar example to that of the sgr 1900 + 14 cluster is described by @xcite in which a group of 12 luminous stars surround the m3 i supergiant star hd143183 within a cluster radius of 0.6  pc .",
    "these examples support the idea that the small cluster of stars near sgr 1900 + 14 and dominated by the m5 supergiants is likely a real association .",
    "a formal astrometric solution , not previously presented , for the positions of the m supergiants based on 21 usno - a2.0 stars gives the result ( @xmath4 0.1 arcsec ) :    star a : @xmath6  =  19@xmath7  07@xmath8  15.35@xmath9 , @xmath10  =  + 09@xmath11  19  21.4 \" ( j2000 )    star b : @xmath6  =  19@xmath7  07@xmath8  15.13@xmath9 , @xmath10  =  + 09@xmath11  19  20.7 \" ( j2000 )",
    "if the cluster was the birthplace of sgr 1900 + 14 , this essentially excludes snr g42.8 + 0.6 as playing any role in the sgr .",
    "although one can envision scenarios in which the snr progenitor was ejected from the cluster by dynamical interaction or a much earlier supernova , this leaves the necessity of the neutron star having been kicked back to almost exactly its place of origin by the supernova that formed snr g42.8 + 0.6 ( since the cluster and sgr localizations are coincident ) , an unlikely coincidence both in space and timing .",
    "however , despite the association of g42.8 + 0.6 with sgr 1900 + 14 in the literature , there has been no evidence supporting this association offered , such as the probablity of finding any snr within a given distance , based on the number density of snrs in the galactic plane .",
    "a more plausable scenario is one in which the cluster and associated dense gas / dust cloud hides a recent supernova . evidence for this cloud comes from figures 1 and 2 and the coincident extended strong far  infrared source indicating compact warm and extended cool dust ( see v96 ) .",
    "optical extinction from this cloud combined with a 1215  kpc distance explains why the supernova would not have been noticed historically .",
    "a very young snr expanding into the dense wind  blown bubble due to mass loss from the supergiant stars in the cluster would be consistent with the otherwise unexplained persistent x  ray source at this position , rx j190717 + 0919.3 @xcite .",
    "while no quiescent radio source is known at this position , a combination of self  absorption within the dense medium and rapid decay @xcite could account for this .",
    "the supernova remnant evolutionary calculations of @xcite indicate that for an ejecta mass of 1 m@xmath12 , and an external density medium of 10 @xmath13 , one finds characteristic sizes of @xmath0 1  pc at t  =  1000 yr ; similar to that of the cluster dimensions at the estimated m supergiant distances .",
    "the most likely position for the sgr itself is the @xcite fading radio source located at @xmath6  =  19@xmath7  07@xmath8  14.33@xmath9 , @xmath10  =  + 09@xmath11  19  21.1 \" ( j2000 ) , with positional accuracy of @xmath4 0.15 arcsec in each coordinate . with these astrometric positions we estimate the approximate distances from the center and edge of the cluster to the radio position as 12 arcsec ( 0.70.9  pc ) and 5 arcsec ( 0.30.4  pc ) , respectively , based on the 1215  kpc distance estimate .",
    "thus , even at the extreme minimum age of the sgr based on the simplest magnetar physics ( @xmath0  700 yr ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 ) this implies a tangential velocity of @xmath0 420 km  s@xmath14 from the near edge of the cluster . while still an ample velocity for the runaway neutron star , it obviates the enormous space velocities implied by associating it with g42.8 + 0.6 @xcite , which is about 12 arcmin away @xcite .",
    "while an isolated instance of the compact , high mass cluster found at / near sgr 1900 + 14 would be dismissed as a chance superposition , its striking similarity to the cluster found near sgr 1806 - 20 by @xcite must be recognized . in that case ,",
    "an lbv supergiant is found associated with a cluster of at least another four massive young stars enshrouded in a bright dust cloud as imaged by iso and located only 7 arcsec from the sgr gamma  ray localization . with an approximate cluster radius of 8 arcsec and an estimated distance of 14.5 kpc ,",
    "this implies a cluster radius of @xmath0  0.6  pc .",
    "now that similar compact clusters have been found near the positions of the two best studied sgrs ( 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14 ) the possiblity that young sgr neutron stars have their origins in compact clusters should be considered seriously .",
