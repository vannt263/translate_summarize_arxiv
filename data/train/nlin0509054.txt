    "the avoided crossing is a ubiquitous structure in energy levels of quantum chaotic systems with external perturbation @xcite . as the time - dependent external perturbation is applied to the system , the quantum state changes nonadiabatically .",
    "especially when the perturbation changes linearly and slowly in time , nonadiabatic transitions can be described by the landau - zener transitions @xcite at avoided crossings . using this microscopic mechanism ,",
    "the nonadiabatic change of the total quantum state might be understood .",
    "energy diffusion phenomena have been intensively studied from this point of view @xcite . to understand macroscopic phenomena such as energy diffusion , it is important to study universal aspects of avoided crossings in quantum systems .",
    "thus , using random matrices@xcite , various distributions concerning avoided crossings have been studied @xcite .",
    "for example , the distributions of the energy level curvature @xcite , the difference between the slopes of the asymptotic lines @xcite , and the minimum energy gap @xcite are derived at avoided crossings , and their universalities are confirmed in concrete quantum systems @xcite .    in this paper , we consider another distribution related to the structure of avoided crossings .",
    "we study the distribution of the spacing in a parameter space of perturbation , which is measured as the distance between two adjacent avoided crossings involved in two neighboring energy levels ( examples of this spacing are depicted in fig .",
    "[ levels ] . )",
    "we call this distribution the avoided - crossing spacing distribution ( acsd ) .",
    "only a few qualitative studies related to the acsd have been published .",
    "goldberg and schweizer obtained the acsd of the hydrogen atom in the magnetic field and that of the africa billiard to estimate the statistical error of the gap distribution @xcite .",
    "wilkinson and austin discussed the density of avoided crossings in quantum systems with two free parameters , although the distribution of the spacing between avoided crossings was not discussed @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to obtain the _ quantitative _ properties of the acsd .",
    "we first consider the hamiltonian taken from random matrices to extract the general features of the acsd .",
    "we calculate the acsds for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) and the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) by a precise numerical calculation .",
    "we find that , for small spacings , the acsd for goe ( gue ) shows the power law behavior with the power @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . for large spacings , the acsds decay exponentially .",
    "we then consider two concrete quantum systems , i.e. , the coupled rotators model and the aharonov - bohm billiard , and find that the acsds of these systems agree with those predicted by simulations using random matrices .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rm ] , we obtain the acsds of a random matrix model for goe and gue , and discuss differences between them , focusing especially on the powers of the distributions . in sec .",
    "[ crt ] and sec .",
    "[ ab ] , we present the acsds of two concrete models and show that they are identical to those of the corresponding random matrix models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ disc ] , we give a summary .",
    "let us consider an @xmath2 hamiltonian matrix @xmath3 including a parameter @xmath4 as an external field . in order to capture general features of the acsd , we take @xmath3 from random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "we prepare random matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 of @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the following random matrix model . @xmath8",
    "note that this model keeps the variance of matrix elements unchanged as the parameter varies @xcite .",
    "if we take both @xmath5 and @xmath6 from goe , the hamiltonian @xmath9 represents quantum systems invariant under an antiunitary transformation such as the time - reversal transformation . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take both of them from gue , the hamiltonian represents quantum systems that have no symmetries for antiunitary transformations @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath4 move from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the variance @xmath12 of diagonal elements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , we need to scale @xmath4 and @xmath13 ( the @xmath14-th eigenvalue of the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath3 ) in order to eliminate the dependence of the parameters on the external field and energy @xcite . following simons and altshuler @xcite ,",
    "we define scaled parameter @xmath15 and scaled energy @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean level spacing at @xmath13 , and @xmath19 denotes a statistical average over a typical range of levels and @xmath4 .",
    "we put @xmath20 , which is followed by @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is set to @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we obtain the scaled energy level flow @xmath24 .",
    "we show the scaled energy spectrum @xmath24 for @xmath9 of goe in fig .",
    "[ levels ] .",
    "some avoided crossings look like crossings indeed , but this is due solely to the line width . in fig .",
    "[ levels ] , three distances ( the right and left arrows ) are shown as examples of avoided - crossing spacing .",
    "of goe as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "three examples of avoided - crossing spacings are also shown . ]",
    "an avoided - crossing spacing is defined by the spacing between two neighboring avoided crossings on the same energy level flow .",
    "now , @xmath25 is identified as the position of an avoided crossing on the @xmath14-th energy level flow if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are satisfied . by taking the differences in positions between two adjacent avoided crossings , avoided - crossing spacings @xmath28 are obtained .",
    "we thereby obtain the acsd @xmath29 , i.e. , the probability that the spacing in the parameter space of the adjacent avoided crossings is @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 satisfies the following normalization conditions .",
    "hereafter , we distinguish between goe and gue by superscript @xmath31 .",
    "we have @xmath32 for goe and @xmath33 for gue .",
    "that is , @xmath34 denotes the acsd of model ( [ rmmodel1 ] ) for goe and gue .",
    "we take the parameter slice @xmath35 to be @xmath36 , which is small enough .",
    "we find @xmath37 avoided - crossing spacings in 50 samples of @xmath38 for goe ( gue ) .",
    "we also define the cumulative distribution @xmath39 of the acsd of @xmath40 for goe and gue as @xmath41 .",
    "figures [ int_tati ] show log - log plots of @xmath39 .",
    "the solid lines in the figures are obtained by fitting the data in the small @xmath28 region by the least - squares method .",
    "consequently , we find that @xmath42 behaves as @xmath43 and that @xmath44 behaves as @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we may write @xmath46        to study how the acsd decays , we compare @xmath34 with the following trial function .",
    "@xmath47 here , coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are determined from the normalization conditions ( [ normalization ] ) : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . in figs .",
    "[ trial](a ) and [ trial](b ) , we see that @xmath54 is well approximated by @xmath55 for large @xmath28 . since eq .",
    "( [ trialeq ] ) implies that @xmath34 decays exponentially for large @xmath28 , we may conclude that no correlation exists between avoided crossings for large @xmath28 .",
    "note that , for small @xmath28 , we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which do not reproduce the numerical data .",
    "we also obtained the acsd of the following random matrix hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath58 we checked that the acsd of this model is the same as that of @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ rmmodel1 ] ) .",
    "as an example of quantum systems for goe , we consider the coupled rotators model @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the acsd of this model is well approximated by @xmath60 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are angular momentums with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. , the eigenvalues of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath70 is a dimensionless parameter in the present unit , we put @xmath71 so that the corresponding classical system becomes strongly chaotic @xcite . noting that @xmath72 changes the @xmath73-component of the total angular momentum @xmath74 by @xmath75 @xcite , the hilbert space is divided into two subspaces corresponding to even @xmath76 and odd @xmath76 . here , we take the subspace in which @xmath76 is even .",
    "furthermore , we divide this subspace into two more subspaces corresponding to the states symmetric and antisymmetric under the exchange of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . here , we choose the subspace corresponding to the symmetric states . in this subspace , we have 1024 levels with no degeneracies when we set @xmath79 .",
    "we have confirmed that the energy level spacing distribution of the coupled rotators model is well approximated by the eigenvalue distribution of random matrices taken from goe in the whole range of @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "after the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) , we find 9094 avoided - crossing spacings .",
    "thus , we obtain the acsd of the coupled rotators model @xmath81 and the cumulative distribution @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ crtfig](a ) , we show @xmath81 together with @xmath60 .",
    "we see that @xmath81 is roughly equal to @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ crtfig](b ) , we show @xmath83 with @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "the inset , which shows the magnified figure with a log - log plot , shows that @xmath83 follows @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we classify @xmath81 as @xmath60 .",
    "now we consider the aharonov - bohm billiard as an example of a quantum system corresponding to gue @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the acsd of this system is well approximated by @xmath84 . in the billiard , a charged particle with mass @xmath85 and charge @xmath86 moves inside the boundary @xmath87 .",
    "the domain @xmath88 is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath89 at the origin .",
    "the schrdinger equation of this system is written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the unit vector perpendicular to the billiard . the domain @xmath88 is determined by the following conformal transformation in the complex plane @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 here , @xmath96 is a complex value in the unit disk @xmath97 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 determines the shape of the billiard .",
    "figures [ b ] show the boundaries of the billiard when @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "let us introduce two new parameters : @xmath101 the value of @xmath102 is restricted to the range @xmath103 $ ] from the symmetry of the system @xcite .",
    "we put @xmath104 , with which the corresponding classical system becomes most strongly chaotic @xcite .",
    "now , the problem with getting the energy @xmath105 of the system in the schrdinger equation ( [ ab_schroe ] ) results in the following eigenvalue problem by expanding the wave function with the bessel function @xcite ; @xmath106 here , @xmath107 are components of the eigenvectors , and    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the @xmath110-th zero of the bessel function @xmath111 and @xmath112 thus , we obtain the energy eigenvalues of the system by diagonalizing the hermitian matrix @xmath113 .",
    "we make a @xmath114 matrix as @xmath113 , and use the lowest 550 levels @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that the energy level spacing distribution of the system is well approximated by the eigenvalue distribution of gue in the whole range of @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "after the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) , we find 1050 avoided - crossing spacings .",
    "thus , we obtain the acsd of the aharonov - bohm billiard @xmath116 and the cumulative distribution @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ abfig](a ) , we show @xmath116 together with @xmath84 . we see that @xmath116 is roughly equal to @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "[ abfig](b ) , we show @xmath118 with @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "the inset , which shows the magnified figure with a log - log plot , reveals that @xmath118 follows @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the acsd of the aharonov - bohm billiard is classified as @xmath84 .",
    "we have studied the acsd in quantum chaotic systems .",
    "the distribution @xmath34 of the random matrix model was numerically obtained .",
    "we found the power law behavior for small spacings and the exponential decay for large spacings . for small spacings , we found that the powers for goe and gue are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the exponential decay implies that the correlation between two avoided crossings vanishes for large spacings .",
    "although these properties are established numerically , an analytical proof for them remains to be completed . in sec .",
    "[ crt ] and sec .",
    "[ ab ] , we have shown by accurate numerical calculations that the distributions predicted by the random matrix model are indeed realized in concrete quantum chaotic systems .",
    "the acsd may play an important role in the quantum dynamics of finite fermion systems such as quantum billiards @xcite .",
    "it is especially worthwhile to consider the time duration until the system starts diffusing after the external perturbation is applied at zero temperature . as the perturbation is applied , pairs of neighboring levels in the energy level flow form avoided crossings .",
    "the quantum state at the fermi level changes over time by making a nonadiabatic transition at the avoided crossing .",
    "the distribution of the time duration until the fermi level encounters the first avoided crossing would be related to the acsd .",
    "it is interesting to experimentally observe the time duration and to understand it in the context of the acsd .",
    "the authors thank professor seiji miyashita for his continuous encouragement .",
    "one of the authors ( m.  m. ) also thanks professor marko robnik for his valuable comments about the aharonov - bohm billiard .",
