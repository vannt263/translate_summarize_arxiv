    "a second interpretation suggests that carrier - mediated ferromagnetism due to mn impurities in the si matrix is responsible for the high @xmath7.@xcite    another way to create a dms is by the deposition of submonolayers of magnetic impurities in a semiconductor host , referred to as @xmath0-doping , as first demonstrated in ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)sb.@xcite dft calculations show that a @xmath0-doped layer of substitutional mn in si is half - metallic.@xcite however , scanning tunneling microscopy studies show that interstitial sites are energetically more favorable,@xcite which drives mn to the subsurface where it forms wires.@xcite interstitial sites are also interesting candidates for creating ferromagnetic order since dft calculations show that a 1/4 @xmath0-doped layer of interstitial mn in si is half - metallic.@xcite a pure interstitial layer is likely difficult to achieve , due to the tendency of the mn to form clusters,@xcite although a mixed @xmath0-doped layer may also yield interesting magnetic properties.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the influence of a pb surfactant on the local structure and magnetism of @xmath0-doped mn - layers on si(001 ) . in the case of si , @xmath0-doping offers the advantage of independent control of the mn and si growth temperatures , where the mn can be grown at cold temperatures and the si cap at higher temperatures . in this way we attempt to avoid the large mn",
