    "current research in music - information - retrieval(mir ) is largely limited to western music cultures and it does not address the north - indian - music - system hereafter nims , cultures in general .",
    "nims raises a big challenge to current rhythm analysis techniques , with a significantly sophisticated rhythmic framework . we should consider a knowledge - based approach to create the computational model for nims rhythm .",
    "tools developed for rhythm analysis can be useful in a lot of applications such as intelligent music archival , enhanced navigation through music collections , content based music retrieval , for an enriched and informed appreciation of the subtleties of music and for pedagogy .",
    "most of these applications deal with music compositions of polyphonic kind in the context of blending of various signals arising from different sources .",
    "apart from the singing voice , different instruments are also included .    as per  @xcite rhythm",
    "relates to the _ patterns of duration _ that are phenomenally present in the music .",
    "it should be noted that that these _ patterns of duration _ are not based on the actual duration of each musical event but on the inter onset interval(ioi ) between the attack points of successive events . as per [  @xcite ] ,",
    "an accent or a stimulus is marked for consciousness in some way .",
    "accents may be phenomenal , i.e. changes in intensity or changes in register , timbre , duration , or simultaneous note density or structural like arrival or departure of a cadence which causes a note to be perceived as accented .",
    "it may be metrical accent which is perceived as accented due to its metrical position [  @xcite .",
    "percussion instruments are normally used to create accents in the rhythmic composition . the percussion family which normally includes timpani ,",
    "snare drum , bass drum , cymbals , triangle , is believed to include the oldest musical instruments , following the human voice [  @xcite ] .",
    "the rhythm information in music is mainly and popularly provided by the percussion instruments .",
    "one simple way of analyzing rhythm of a composite or polyphonic music signal having some percussive component , may be to extract the percussive component from it using some source separation techniques based on frequency based filtering .",
    "various attempts have been made in western music to develop applications for re - synthesizing the drum track of a composite music signal , identification of type of drums played in the composite signal[ex .",
    "the works of  @xcite etc .",
    ", described in section  [ past ] in detail ] .",
    "human listeners are able to perceive individual sound events in complex compositions , even while listening to a polyphonic music recording , which might include unknown timbres or musical instruments .",
    "however designing an automated system for rhythm detection from a polyphonic music composition is very difficult .    in the context of nims rhythm",
    "popularly known as _ tla _ , _ tabl _ is the most popular percussive instrument .",
    "its right hand drum-_dayan _ and left hand drum-_bayan _ are played together and amplitude - peaks spaced at regular time intervals , are created by playing every stroke .",
    "one way of rhythm information retrieval from polyphonic composition having _ tabl _ as one of the percussive instruments , may be to extract the _ tabl _ signal from it and analyze it separately .",
    "the _ dayan _ has a frequency overlap with other instruments and mostly human - voice for polyphonic music , so if we extract the whole range of frequencies for both _ bayan _ and _ dayan _ components , by existing frequency based filtering methods , the resultant signal will be a noisy version of original song as it will still have part of other instruments , human voice components along with _",
    "tabl_. also conventional source separation methods lead to substantial loss of information or sometimes addition of unwanted noise .",
    "this is the an area of challenge in _ tla _ analysis for nims .",
    "although , nims _ tla _ functions in many ways like western meter , as a periodic , hierarchic framework for rhythmic design , it is composed of a sequence of unequal time intervals and has longer time cycles .",
    "moreover _ tla _ in nims is distinctively cyclical and much more complex compared to western meter [  @xcite ] .",
    "this complexity is another challenge for _ tla _ analysis .    due to the above reasons defining a computational framework for automatic rhythm information retrieval for north indian polyphonic compositions",
    "is a challenging task .",
    "very less work has been done for rhythmic information retrieval from a polyphonic composition in nims context . in western music , quite a few approaches are followed for this purpose , mostly in the areas of beat - tracking , tempo analysis , annotation of strokes / pulses from the separated percussive signal .",
    "we have described these systems in the section  [ past ] . for nims ,",
    "very few works of rhythm analysis are done by adopting western drum - event retrieval system .",
    "these works result in finding out meter or speed which are not very significant in the context of nims .",
    "hence this is an unexplored area of research for nims .    in this work",
    "we have proposed a completely new approach , i.e.instead of extracting both _",
    "bayan _ and _ dayan _ signal , we have extracted the _ bayan _ signal from the polyphonic composition by using band - pass filter .",
    "this filter extracts lower frequency part which normally does not overlap with the frequency of human voice and other instruments in a polyphonic composition .",
    "most of the _ tla_-s start with a _ bol _ or stroke which has a _ bayan _ component(either played with _ bayan _ alone or both _",
    "bayan _ and _ dayan _ together ) and also the some consequent section(_vibhga _ in nims terminology ) boundary-_bol_-s have similar _ bayan _ component .",
    "hence these strokes would be captured in the extracted _ bayan _ signal . for a polyphonic composition",
    ", its _ tla _ is rendered with cyclically recurring patterns of fixed time - lengths .",
    "this is the cyclic property of nims , discussed in detail in section  [ defn ] . so after extracting the starting _",
    "bol_-s and the section boundary strokes from the _ bayan _ signal , we can exploit the cyclic property of a _ tla _ and the pattern of strokes appearing in a single cycle and can detect important rhythm information from a polyphonic composition .",
    "this would be a positive step towards rhythm information retrieval from huge collection of music recordings for both film music and live performances of various genres of _ hindi _ music . here , we consider the _ tla _ detection of different single - channel , polyphonic clips of _ hindi _ vocal songs of devotional , semi - classical and movie soundtracks from nims , having variety of tempo and _ mtr_-s .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a review of past work is presented in section  [ past ] .",
    "some definitions are provided in section  [ defn ] . in section  [ meth ]",
    "the proposed methodology is elaborated .",
    "experimental results are placed in section  [ exp ] and the paper ends with concluding remarks in section  [ con ] .",

    "+    * * _ bol : _ * in the _ tla _ system of north indian music , the actual articulation of _ tla _ is done by certain syllables which are the mnemonic names of different strokes / pulses corresponding to each _ mtra_. these syllables are called _ bol_-s",

    "+ normally in a nims composition there may be many absent _ bol_-s in the _ thek _ played for the _ tla_. in these cases other percussive instruments(other than _ tabl _ ) and vocal emphasis might generate percussive peaks for the time positions of the absent strokes , depending on the composition , the lyrics being sung and thus the rhythm of the composition is maintained . * * _ thek _ : * for _ tabl _ , the basic characteristic pattern of _ bol_-s that repeats itself cyclically along the progression of the rendering of _ tla _ in a composition , is called _ thek_. in other words it s the most basic cyclic form of the _ tla _ [  @xcite ] . naturally _ thek _ corresponds to the basic pattern of _ bol_-s in an _ vart_. the strong starting _",
