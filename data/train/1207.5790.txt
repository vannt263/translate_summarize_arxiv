    "<S> this is a safe assumption up to a frequency scale @xmath50 , which is well above the oscillation frequency of any of the harmonic modes that we can measure in our device .    </S>",
    "<S> the simple analysis we have outlined is primarily limited by the fact that we have supposed the temperature profile @xmath51 to have no meaningful variation along the length of the string . </S>",
    "<S> still , it reliably captures the fact that the thermal time scale is on the order of microseconds ( rather than nanoseconds , as for the device described in ref .  ) , orders of magnitude faster than the time for the mechanical energy to be transferred to the environment , as dictated by the high @xmath0 of the string : @xmath52  ms .    in our ac local heating scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the power pumped into the string is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the string s electrical resistance and @xmath55 is the alternating voltage applied across the string . </S>",
    "<S> since the silicon nitride is insulating ( @xmath56 ) , we can estimate the resistance from the geometry of the device using standard values @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath58 for the resistivity of cr and au : @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the 176  @xmath7 we measure experimentally is higher , mainly because it includes the resistance of the metallic supports . </S>",

    "<S> the predicted coefficient , 6.82  v@xmath67 , is about ten times larger than the value @xmath68 obtained from a fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> theory and experiment can be made to coincide if instead we take the thermal time to be @xmath69@xmath3s . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , we are able to use this local heating to actuate the bilayer nanostring by passing an ac current along the length of the device . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is subtly different from the bimaterial effect in cantilevers and non - uniformly coated beams , where the gold exerts a force on the cantilever that pushes it towards the substrate.@xcite in such a scenario , the force is directional , and hence the ac drive voltage must be applied at frequency @xmath78 in order to produce heating and bending at @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in our system there is no preference towards or away from the substrate as the gold expands , since it forms a continuous layer over the string . </S>",
    "<S> heating and bending occur twice per string oscillation , and therefore the applied drive voltage and resulting motion have the same frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to actuate the device at @xmath78 , although @xmath80 times less efficiently  consistent with the above scenario .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the nanostring becomes nonlinear . </S>",
    "<S> yet even at quite high drives , in vacuum , we see no change in the resistance of the gold layer . </S>",

    "<S> approximately 10 times that required for optimal signal - to - noise , is there an onset of resistance changes in the gold layer . </S>",
    "<S> the device continues to function with applied voltages in excess of @xmath85 mv , after which it rapidly becomes an open circuit . using the extracted value @xmath86s , we can estimate that the upturn in resistance , appearing at @xmath87  mv in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4](b ) , reveals that the gold has only been removed from a small patch on the string surface yet has interrupted the current path .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we note that the ac ohmic actuation technique works for both higher - order harmonics in vacuum ( not shown ) as well as for the fundamental modes in air . in the ambient pressure case , </S>",
    "<S> the nanostrings experience strong viscous damping , especially when the motion is perpendicular to the string s substantial width . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> there is a greater cross - section for molecular collisions , and thus energy loss , in the out - of - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> the voltages required to actuate the nanostring in air ( @xmath91  mv ) result in resistance changes and eventual failure . improving the @xmath0 in viscous environments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite would decrease the required actuation voltages and prevent such failure .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> gold bilayer nanostrings are an enhancement to the already exciting system of silicon nitride nanostrings . </S>",
    "<S> they enable chemical functionalization and molecular detection , provide a scheme for local heating to study thermal response of molecules or desorb unwanted molecules , and provide simple and integrated actuation . and </S>",
