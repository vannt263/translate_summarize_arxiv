    "ensembles of hermitian random matrices with invariant measures have been thoroughly studied in the literature @xcite . much less known are non - hermitian random matrices @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss a class of isotropic non - hermitian matrices that represent a natural extension of the class of invariant hermitian matrices to the non - hermitian case : the probability measure of an isotropic random matrix ensemble is invariant under the left ( and right ) multiplication by an arbitrary unitary matrix . here",
    "we are interested in properties of the limiting eigenvalue densities of products of isotropic matrices in the limit of infinite matrix size @xmath0 .",
    "these properties can be deduced from the correspondence between large random matrices and free random variables @xcite , and most of them follow from the haagerup - larsen theorem @xcite , that was formulated in the framework of free probability .",
    "this theorem gives a very useful relation between the eigenvalue density of an isotropic matrix @xmath15 and the density of its invariant hermitian partner @xmath16 .",
    "we exploit this relation to discuss the spectral commutativity and the self - averaging of the product of isotropic random matrices in the large @xmath14 limit .",
    "the product of identically distributed independent matrices has the same eigenvalue density as the corresponding power of a single random matrix @xcite .",
    "this is an exceptional property which has no counterpart in classical probability theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : irm ] we recall the definition of isotropic random matrices and the haagerup - larsen theorem @xcite . in section [ sec : prod ] we discuss products of isotropic matrices and the spectral commutativity of the multiplication of infinitely large matrices from this class . in section [ sec : examples ] we illustrate how to use the haagerup - larsen relation to calculate the eigenvalue density for a few isotropic matrices in the large @xmath14-limit . in section [ sec : sv ] we analyze the correspondence between the singularities of the eigenvalue density and the singular value density . in section [ sec : fs ] we discuss finite size effects for three generic ensembles of isotropic matrices . in section [ sec : fsp ] we compare eigenvalue densities for products of finite matrices , obtained by monte - carlo simulations , with the limiting densities calculated analytically using the method discussed earlier in section [ sec : prod ] . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we shortly summarize the paper .",
    "before we discuss isotropic matrices , let us recall invariant hermitian random matrices .",
    "a random hermitian matrix @xmath17 is called invariant if its probability measure is invariant under the transformation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary unitary matrix .",
    "the notion of random matrix is analogous to random variable , so one has to remember that the term `` random matrix '' does not refer to a single instance but to an ensemble of matrices with a given probability measure .",
    "thus , invariance of @xmath17 stands for the invariance of the probability measure or , in other words , that the random matrices @xmath17 and @xmath20 have the same probability measures .",
    "randomness of an invariant hermitian matrix is entirely encoded in its eigenvalue distribution in contrast to non - invariant random matrices . however , with any hermitian non - invariant random matrix @xmath21 one can associate a unique invariant random matrix @xmath17 that has exactly the same eigenvalue distribution as @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is drawn according to the uniform ( haar ) measure from the unitary group @xmath24 .    a random matrix @xmath25 is called isotropic @xcite if it can be decomposed into a product of an invariant hermitian positive semi - definite random matrix @xmath17 and a haar unitary matrix @xmath23 : @xmath26 . clearly @xmath27 .",
    "statistical properties of @xmath25 are inherited from its invariant hermitian partner @xmath17 .",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath17 correspond to singular values of @xmath25 .",
    "the concept of isotropic random matrices is a natural generalization of the concept of rotationally invariant complex variables that can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a non - negative real random variable and @xmath30 is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath31 .",
    "one should note that isotropic matrices can be constructed also from non - invariant random hermitian matrices as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are independent unitary haar matrices and @xmath21 is an arbitrary hermitian positive semi - definite random matrix which is not necessarily invariant . in particular @xmath21 may be a diagonal random matrix with independent identically distributed non - negative real random variables on the diagonal .",
    "the probability measure of an isotropic random matrix is invariant under the right @xmath34 ( and left @xmath35 ) multiplication by any unitary matrix @xmath19 .",
    "this property can be used as an alternative definition of isotropic random matrices .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution @xmath36 of an isotropic random matrix @xmath25 is circularly symmetric on the complex plane .",
    "it depends only on the eigenvalue modulus @xmath37 , so it can be written as a function of a single real argument @xmath38 .",
    "the radial profile of the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath25 depends on the eigenvalue distribution @xmath39 of the matrix @xmath17 and on the size @xmath14 of the matrix . in two limiting cases of matrix dimensions , @xmath40 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the relation between eigenvalue distribution of the isotropic matrix @xmath25 and of its hermitian partner @xmath17 is explicitly known .",
    "for @xmath40 the random matrix @xmath25 reduces to a complex random variable , and the matrix @xmath17 to a real non - negative random variable .",
    "the relation between the two reads @xmath41 where @xmath30 is a phase uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath31 .",
    "the relation between the distributions of the random variables @xmath25 and @xmath17 can be conveniently expressed in terms of the cumulative density function @xmath42 for @xmath17 and the radial cumulative distribution function for @xmath25 @xmath43 the relation between the cumulative distributions for @xmath25 and @xmath17 reads @xmath44 .",
    "it amounts to @xmath45 .",
    "of course this relation holds only for @xmath40 .",
    "below we use the radial cumulative density function @xmath46 also for @xmath47 . in this case",
    "@xmath46 is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen eigenvalue of @xmath25 lies within distance @xmath48 from the origin of the complex plane .",
    "as we mentioned , the relation between the eigenvalue distributions of @xmath25 and @xmath17 is also known for @xmath0 @xcite , as in this limit random matrices can be mapped onto free random variables @xcite : invariant hermitian matrices to free real random variables , and isotropic random matrices to r - diagonal free random variables @xcite . in other words , in this case one can use methods of free probability @xcite to derive the relation .",
    "we quote here the result that is known as the haagerup - larsen theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the radial cumulative density function of @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the s - transform @xcite for @xmath27 @xmath49 the support of the radial profile @xmath50 extends from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , so that the eigenvalue density of @xmath25 forms either a disk of radius @xmath52 if @xmath53 or a ring if @xmath54 .",
    "the disc ( or ring ) is centered at the origin of the complex plane .",
    "the internal radius is @xmath55 and the external one @xmath56 .",
    "the internal radius is positive @xmath54 and the support of @xmath57 is a ring , if for @xmath58 the eigenvalue density @xmath39 decays to zero faster than the first power of @xmath59 : @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "otherwise , the support of the eigenvalue density of @xmath25 is a disk . to be precise",
    ", the theorem assumes that the eigenvalue density of @xmath17 has no isolated point masses ( dirac deltas ) in the spectrum .",
    "in other words , the spectrum of @xmath17 must be continuous .",
    "( [ eq : hltheorem ] ) tells us that the cumulative distribution @xmath62 implicitly depends on the eigenvalue density of the matrix @xmath17 through the s - transform @xmath63 .",
    "so , let us recall what the s - transform is @xcite .",
    "it is defined for an infinitely large ( @xmath64 invariant hermitian matrix .",
    "let @xmath65 be such a matrix . denoting the limiting eigenvalue density of this matrix by @xmath66 ,",
    "the s - transform is calculated as follows .",
    "first , one calculates the green s function as the stieltjes transform of the eigenvalue density @xmath67 @xmath68 is a complex function defined outside the support @xmath69 of the eigenvalue density , which consists of intervals on the real axis .",
    "the green s function can be expanded in powers of @xmath70 , and the coefficients of this expansion are equal to the moments of the eigenvalue distribution : @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "one can alternatively define the moment - generating function : @xmath74 expanding it in @xmath75 one obtains an infinite power series @xmath76 if all moments exist .",
    "the s - transform for the matrix @xmath65 is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the inverse of the moment - generating function @xmath79 : @xmath80 the s - transform of the product of independent invariant matrices @xmath81 ( free random variables ) is equal to the product of the corresponding s - transforms @xcite : @xmath82 since the s - transform is a complex - valued function the multiplication on the right hand side of the equation is both associative and commutative .",
    "this property has deep consequences for products of isotropic matrices in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , as we discuss in the next section , multiplication of isotropic random matrices is commutative in this limit .    coming back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hltheorem ] ) we see that in order to calculate the cumulative distribution of an isotropic matrix @xmath25 , we first have to calculate the s - transform for the matrix @xmath83 .",
    "assume we know the eigenvalue density of @xmath17 .",
    "the eigenvalue density of @xmath84 is @xmath85 finding the green s function @xmath86 for @xmath84 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) and then the s - transform @xmath87 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_chi ] ) , we obtain an explicit equation for @xmath62 ( eg .",
    "[ eq : hltheorem ] ) . actually , if one eliminates the s - transform from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hltheorem ] ) one can rewrite the latter as @xmath88 applying to it eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phi],[eq : s_chi ] ) .",
    "this equation has been derived independently in refs .",
    "this form is however less transparent than eq .",
    "( [ eq : hltheorem ] ) , which explicitly refers to the s - transform and thus uncovers an important connection to the commutative nature of the multiplication of the s - transform ( eq . [ eq : sab ] ) that is responsible for the spectral commutativity of the isotropic matrices in the large @xmath14-limit , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "consider a product of a finite number , @xmath4 , of independent isotropic random matrices @xmath89 in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "the goal is to calculate the eigenvalue density of @xmath90 given the eigenvalue densities of the @xmath91 s .",
    "the product of isotropic random matrices is also isotropic so the eigenvalue density of the product can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hltheorem ] ) replacing @xmath25 by @xmath90 and @xmath17 by @xmath92 .",
    "so we have to calculate the s - transform for @xmath93 . as a consequence of the multiplication law ( [ eq : sab ] ) the s - transform of the matrix for @xmath93 with @xmath90 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prod ] ) can be written as a product of s - transforms @xcite : @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "it is a simple consequence of the associativity and commutativity of the s - transform composition rule ( [ eq : sab ] ) .",
    "this means that the equation for the radial cumulative eigenvalue density @xmath96 of the matrix @xmath90 ( [ eq : prod ] ) can be expressed in terms of the s - transforms for individual factors in the product ( [ eq : prod ] ) : @xmath97 if one writes an analogous equation for the product @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an arbitrary permutation of the set @xmath100 one obtains exactly the same equation as in ( [ eq : s1n ] ) @xmath101 but now for @xmath102",
    ". therefore the functions @xmath103 and @xmath102 are identical @xmath104 . in other words , the eigenvalue distribution of the product of isotropic matrices ( [ eq : prod_pi ] )",
    "does not depend on the order of matrix multiplication in the large @xmath14-limit .",
    "as we mentioned , the multiplication of infinitely large isotropic matrices has another surprising property .",
    "the product of @xmath4 independent identically distributed matrices isotropic that we denote by @xmath105 has exactly the same probability measure as a power @xmath106 of a single matrix @xcite .",
    "it was first discovered for the product of ginibre matrices @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completness we repeat here the argument given in ref .",
    "( [ eq : s1n ] ) for the product of identically distributed matrices takes the form @xmath107 which means that @xmath108 . on the other hand , by construction ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath109 are given by powers of eigenvalues of @xmath25 : @xmath110 , so the probability that @xmath111 is equal to the probability that @xmath112 : @xmath113 .",
    "it follows that @xmath114 and hence @xmath115 .    to summarize this section",
    ", the product of a finite number of independent infinitely dimensional isotropic random matrices is an isotropic random matrix .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution of this matrix does not depend on the order of multiplication .",
    "moreover , if there are independent identically distributed matrices in the product they can be substituted by the corresponding power of a single random matrix from the corresponding matrix ensemble .",
    "for instance the product @xmath116 has the same limiting eigenvalue density as @xmath117 .",

    "<S> we show that the multiplication of large isotropic random matrices is spectrally commutative and self - averaging in the limit of infinite matrix size @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of spectral commutativity means that the eigenvalue density of a product @xmath1 of such matrices is independent of the order of matrix multiplication , for example the matrix @xmath2 has the same eigenvalue density as @xmath3 . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the notion of self - averaging means that the product of @xmath4 independent but identically distributed random matrices , which we symbolically denote by @xmath5 , has the same eigenvalue density as the corresponding power @xmath6 of a single matrix drawn from the underlying matrix ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the eigenvalue density of @xmath7 is the same as of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the singular behavior of the eigenvalue and singular value densities of isotropic matrices and their products for small eigenvalues @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the singularities at the origin of the eigenvalue density and of the singular value density are in one - to - one correspondence in the limit @xmath0 : the eigenvalue density of an isotropic random matrix has a power law singularity at the origin @xmath10 with a power @xmath11 when and only when the density of its singular values has a power law singularity @xmath12 with a power @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained analytically in the limit @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we supplement these results with numerical simulations for large but finite @xmath14 and discuss finite size effects for the most common ensembles of isotropic random matrices . </S>"
