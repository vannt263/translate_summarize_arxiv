    "to date , @xmath8135 extrasolar planets are securely known around nearby fgkm stars .",
    "all were discovered by the doppler technique ( see references within butler ( 2002 ) and mayor and santos ( 2003 ) . ) .",
    "the minimum masses span the range from 0.1 m@xmath2to above 13 m@xmath9 , merging into the `` brown dwarf '' domain .",
    "the distribution of planet masses rises steeply toward the lowest detectable masses with a power law dependence , d@xmath10/d@xmath11 @xcite , even after correction for the unknown orbital inclination ( jorissen , mayor & udry 2001 ) .",
    "two of the domains that remain relatively unexplored are the distribution of planet masses below 1 m@xmath12and the occurrence of planets in general for low mass stars .",
    "the distribution of masses of planets below that of saturn remains poorly constrained because of the difficulty in their detection , demanding doppler precision of 3 or better .",
    "prior to the discovery reported herein , eight known exoplanets had @xmath1below 1 m@xmath13 , namely those orbiting hd  16141 and hd  46375 ( marcy 2000 ) , hd  16874 ( pepe 2002 ) , hd  76700 ( tinney 2003 ) , hd 49674 ( butler 2003 ) , hd 3651 ( fischer et al .",
    "2003 ) , 55 cnc ( planet `` c '' , marcy et al .",
    "2002 ) and hd 99492 @xcite .",
    "hd 46375 and hd 99492 have the lowest known minimum masses , both having @xmath1= 0.11 m@xmath2= 0.3 m@xmath12 . two sub ",
    "saturn candidates reside in distinctly eccentric orbits , namely hd 16141 ( @xmath14=75 days , @xmath15=0.18 ) and hd 3651 ( @xmath14=62.2 d , @xmath15 = 0.64 ) , suggesting that whatever mechanism pumps eccentricities in exoplanets , it acts on planets of sub  saturn mass as well as on planets of @xmath810 m@xmath2 .",
    "only one planetary system was previously known around an m dwarf , gj  876 with its two planets ( marcy et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the total number of m dwarfs being surveyed by precise doppler measurements is roughly 200 ( wright et al . 2004 , mayor & santos 2003 , kurster et al . 2003 , endl et al . 2003 ) . the solitary planetary system ( gj  876 ) known around m dwarfs implies that the occurrence rate of planets having masses greater than 1 m@xmath2and orbiting with periods , @xmath16 3 yr ( @xmath17 1.5 au ) , is only @xmath80.5 % .",
    "in contrast , the occurrence rate of analogous planets around f & g  type main sequence stars is @xmath85% ( mayor & santos 2003 ; marcy et al .",
    "2004a ) for such orbital periods .",
    "thus , the occurrence rate of jupiter  mass planets around m dwarfs having masses , @xmath18=0.30.5 m@xmath19is roughly an order of magnitude lower than that around f & g main sequence stars with @xmath18 = 0.81.2 m@xmath19 .    obviously , this approximate estimate of the occurrence of jupiters as a function of stellar mass suffers both from selection effects and from small numbers .",
    "the faintness of m dwarfs makes doppler measurements more difficult .",
    "nonetheless , planets of jupiter  mass would make a doppler signature of at least 20 for orbits within 2 au , rendering them easily detectable .",
    "thus , the decline in planet occurrence with smaller stellar mass has statistical integrity , although the data are insufficient to establish an accurate relationship .",
    "the diversity of planetary systems , including their observed masses and orbits , almost certainly stems from formation processes in protoplanetary disks ( see for example , lissauer 1995 ; levison , lissauer , & duncan , 1998 ; alibert , mordasini , & benz 2004 ) .",
    "young , low mass stars may be surrounded by protoplanetary disks that have lower mass and lower surface mass density than those surrounding young solar mass stars ( t tauri stars ) .",
    "if so , the formation of jupiter  mass planets may be inhibited at all orbital radii ( laughlin , bodenheimer , adams 2004 ) .",
    "thus , low mass planets of neptune  saturn mass may be as common around m dwarfs as jupiter  mass planets are around solar mass stars .",
    "alternatively , gas accretion may operate so much less efficiently , or the lifetime of the gas may be so short , in low mass protoplanetary disks that predominantly rock ",
    "ice cores form only , with few gas giants forming .",
    "more m dwarfs should be surveyed to establish the dependences of planet properties on stellar mass , especially at detection thresholds of sub  saturn masses . here , we report the detection of a planet with the lowest @xmath1yet found , orbiting an m dwarf .",

    "its mass may be estimated from various empirical mass  luminosity calibrations and theoretical models for m dwarfs .",
    "the empirical relation between stellar mass and @xmath21  from henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) suggests that @xmath22 = 0.42 @xmath23 0.05 m@xmath5 , where the uncertainty stems from the standard deviation of the observed scatter in the stars of measured mass at a given @xmath21 .",

    "( 1998 ) for solar metallicity , [ m / h ]  =  0.0 , predict a mass of 0.40 m@xmath19for gj  436 .",
    "their models suggest that if the star were metal  rich , [ m / h ]  =  + 0.25 , the implied mass would be higher by approximately 0.05 m@xmath19 , constituting a plausible systematic error due to the unknown metallicity of the star",
    ". the models of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest a mass of 0.35 m@xmath5 , somewhat less than that from the empirical relation . here",
    "we adopt the simple average of the two empirical estimates from henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) and from delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for gj  436 yielding @xmath18=0.41 @xmath23 0.05 m@xmath19",
    ".    the age of gj  436 may be constrained by various diagnostics .",
    "leggett ( 1992 ) reports galactic uvw velocities of + 45.3 , -20.0 , + 17.9 , in agreement with reid , hawley , & gizis ( 1995 ) who give + 44 , -20 , + 20 .",
    "these velocities render the star a member of the `` old disk '' population .",
    "indeed , for m dwarfs fainter than v = 10 , there remains a kinematic bias toward identification of older , metal  poor stars and subsequent inclusion in catalogs ( reid , hawley , gizis 1995 ; carney , latham & laird 1990 ) .",
    "its uvw velocity components suggest that gj  436 has an age of at least 2 gyr and probably has a metal abundance not much greater than solar .",
    "furthermore , gj  436 is not a flare star nor does it exhibit particularly strong chromospheric emission at h & k  ( figure 1 ) for an m dwarf of its spectral type .",
    "it shows no emission at the balmer lines in our high resolution spectra .",
    "this low chromospheric activity is consistent with a star middle - aged or older , placing the age likely greater than 3 gyr consistent with the kinematics .",
    "we measured the rotational line broadening to be , @xmath24@xmath25 3 (  5 ) .",
    "also , gj  436 is photometrically constant at millimag levels ( see  6 ) , indicating that spots and magnetic fields are weak , consistent with an age greater than 3 gyr .      the photospheric velocity jitter of gj  436 may be estimated from the @xmath830 other m dwarfs on our keck planet ",
    "search program that have similar stellar properties , namely b - v between 1.4 and 1.6 , similar @xmath21 , and similar h & k  emission , as described by wright et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and have been observed at least 10 times over 4 or more years . in brief , the @xmath8 30 m dwarfs of similar spectral type , @xmath21 , and @xmath26  are deemed comparison stars . for each of them",
    "the rms of their velocity measurements is determined and the internal velocity error is subtracted in quadrature .",
    "the remaining velocity scatter represents the variance of our velocities caused by all sources excluding photon  limited errors .",
    "a minority of our comparison m dwarfs may have unseen companions which would raise the velocity rms above that caused simply by photospheric jitter .",
    "thus , wright et al .",
    "determine the median value ( instead of the mean ) of those rms values for the comparison stars , to suppress the effect of companions .",
    "the resulting median of the rms values is found to be 3.3 , with a standard deviation of 2.1 about that median .",
    "this estimated jitter of 3.3 is presumably due to convective overshoot , spots , flares , oscillations , and other non  uniformities on the rotating stellar surface .",
    "however , this jitter estimate , by its empirical construction , also includes errors caused by any instrumental and software inadequacies , as well as by low mass planets , that cause variations in our actual velocity measurements .",
    "endl et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained 17 radial velocity measurements of gj  436 using the hobby ",
    "eberly telescope during 394 days .",
    "those velocities exhibited an rms of 20.6 , constituting an excess velocity variability above errors .",
    "their search for periodicities did not a reveal significant signal .",
    "endl et al .",
    "( 2003 ) considered carefully the possibility that jitter was the cause of the excess velocity scatter .",
    "they note that its stellar magnetic activity level and x  ray luminosity ( @xmath27 ) are modest and similar to other quiet , old m dwarfs ( such as gj 411 ) that show a velocity rms of less than 10 , suggesting that the jitter of gj  436 should be similarly smaller than 10 .",
    "our analysis similarly finds that gj  436 is only modestly active , consistent with jitter of @xmath8 3 . thus , it is quite possible that some of the excess velocity scatter noted by endl et al .",
    "( 2003 ) was caused by the planet we detect here .",
    "our velocities ( presented in table 1 ) are not inconsistent with the results plotted for gl 436 in figure 6 of endl et al . within their error bars of 1219 .    the chromospheric emission at the k line in gj  436 is shown in figure 1 along with the same line in four comparison m dwarfs with similar b - v and v magnitude",
    "we measure emission at both the h & k  lines and find an average value from 2000 to 2004 of @xmath28 for gj  436 ( wright et al .",
    "2004 ) on the mount wilson scale ( baliunas 1995 ) .",
    "the apparent strong emission in figure 1 is deceptively striking because of the weak uv continua of low temperature dwarfs .",
    "indeed , the ratio of h & k  flux to the bolometric flux of the star is only @xmath29  =   -5.22 representative of the most chromospherically inactive stars .",
    "however , the precise values of @xmath26  for m dwarfs remain difficult to measure and carry uncertainties of @xmath8 20% due to the poor calibration of uv continuum fluxes as a function of b - v for such low mass stars ( wright et al .",

    "wilson @xmath30 value of 0.51.3 is typical , showing that emission from the chromospheric gas at @xmath810,000 k competes easily with the faint uv continuum of these cool dwarfs .",
    "the comparison stars have chromospheric emission bracketing that of gj  436 , rendering them useful comparison stars for estimating photospheric jitter and velocity errors",

    "the sample comprises a complete sample of isolated m dwarfs ( separation greater than 2 arcsec from any companion ) accessible to keck within 9 pc that are brighter than v = 11 .",
    "the magnitude threshold favors selection of early  type m dwarfs , m0m5 , causing exclusion of dwarfs later than m5 .",
    "a few of the 150 m dwarfs are fainter than v = 11 and a few are farther than 9 pc .",
    "our complete sample of m dwarfs has been monitored for the past 3  7 years and is listed by wright et al .",
    "for m dwarfs having magnitudes , v = 8  12 , the typical exposure times are 48 minutes yielding a s / n ratio per pixel in the spectra of 30075 , respectively .",
    "the resulting radial velocity measurements have an internal precision of 28 , based on the agreement ( uncertainty in the mean ) of the @xmath8 400 spectral intervals of 2  .",
    "we measure doppler shifts by placing an iodine absorption cell ( marcy & butler 1992 ) near the focal plane of the telescope centered on the optical axis , to superimpose iodine lines on the stellar spectrum , providing a wavelength calibration and proxy for the point spread function ( psf ) of the spectrometer ( valenti et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the temperature of the cell is controlled to @xmath35 c and the pyrex iodine cell is sealed so that the column density of iodine remains constant ( butler 1996 ) .",

    "v and v magnitude are shown in figure 2 .",
    "these four stars bracket gj  436 in both apparent brightness and chromospheric activity .",
    "the four comparison stars exhibit rms velocity ranging from 2.32 to 4.65 , representing the bottom line in the error budget , including errors from limited photons , any instrumental effects , doppler analysis errors , and astrophysical jitter effects for such stars .",
    "we obtained 42 high resolution spectra of gj  436 at the keck 1 telescope with the hires echelle spectrometer ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) during the 4.5year period , jan 2000 to july 2004 ( jd = 2451552.1  2453196.8 ) .",
    "the times of observation , velocities , and uncertainties are listed in table 1 .",
    "the exposure times were 8  10 minutes , yielding s / n  @xmath37  150 and resulting in an uncertainty in the radial velocity of 4.4 ( median ) per exposure .",
    "starting on 29 july 2003 ( jd = 2452849 ) , we noticed an apparent periodicity of 2.64 d in our extant velocities . during the ensuing year of observations",
    ", as we tested the existence of the prospective planet , we usually obtained three consecutive exposures within a night to reduce the photon  limited errors by @xmath38 to @xmath8 3 .",
    "we suspect that inadequacies in our current deconvolution algorithm result in another 2 of stochastic error caused by accentuated noise in our deconvolved spectrum .",
    "refinement of our deconvolution algorithm for m dwarfs is in progress .",
    "figure 3 shows the measured velocities vs. time for gj  436 , with each point representing the binned velocities in intervals of 2 hours for clarity .",
    "the internal velocity uncertainty was typically 4.4 ( median ) as gauged from the uncertainty in the mean of the 400 spectral chunks separately analyzed in the doppler analysis .",
    "this doppler uncertainty is similar to that of the comparison m dwarfs of similar v magnitude ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the recently obtained multiple exposures which were binned to final velocity measurements from 2003.9 to the present , have uncertainties of only @xmath8 34 , benefitting from the greater number of photons collected .",
    "the velocities for gj  436 exhibit an rms of 13.3 .",
    "this scatter is much greater than the internal errors of 4.7 that stem from the uncertainty in the mean of the 400 spectral chunks that are separately analyzed for their doppler shifts .",
    "the expected jitter is only 3.3 based on comparable m dwarfs , as discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "one may compute the probability that the scatter would be as large or larger than 13.3 due to chance fluctuations of the known doppler errors and jitter , added in quadrature .",
    "we adopt here the quadrature sum of internal doppler error for each measurement and the expected jitter of 3.3 , as the effective noise .",
    "we fit a straight line to the velocities and examine the reduced @xmath39 for the residuals , adopting this effective noise as the uncertainty per measurement in the calculation of @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting reduced @xmath40 = 2.57 which has a probability of occurrence by chance of less than 0.001 .",
    "thus the velocity scatter in gj  436 is larger than can be understood by known sources of errors and photospheric jitter .",
    "a periodogram of the entire set of keck velocities for gj  436 is shown in figure 4 .",
    "a strong peak resides at a period of 2.643 d. the the false alarm probability associated with this peak is fap @xmath25 @xmath41 based on both the analytical assessment of the number of independent frequencies ( gilliland and baliunas 1987 ) and by monte carlo realizations in which the velocities are scrambled and power spectra recomputed at the scrambled velocities .",
    "the window function produces peaks that surround the peak at 2.64 d , but they are not statistically significant .",
    "we have fit the velocities for gj  436 with a keplerian model including a floating linear velocity trend , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "the fit yields an orbital period , @xmath14 = 2.6441 d , velocity semi - amplitude @xmath42 , and an eccentricity of @xmath15  =  0.12 .",
    "all orbital parameters are listed in table 2 . adopting the stellar mass of 0.41 m@xmath19(2.1 )",
    "implies a minimum mass for the orbiting companion of @xmath1= 0.067 m@xmath2and a semi - major axis of 0.0278 au .",
    "the linear velocity trend has slope of 2.7@xmath231.5 per year , implying the possible existence of a more distant companion , but still only marginally credible .",
    "the uncertainties in table 2 are based on monte carlo realizations of the data .",
    "fit radial velocity curve is subtracted from the original velocities and the residuals are adopted as representative of the amplitude and distribution of velocity noise from all sources , including velocity errors and photospheric jitter .",
    "the residuals are permuted and added back to the best - fit radial velocity curve , leaving the times of observation the same .",
    "this approach yields many realizations of the set of velocity measurements of the best ",
    "fit planet , assuming that the noise distribution is as exhibited by the residuals .",
    "a gaussian distribution of errors was not assumed ( but such a simplification yields similar values for the uncertainties in the orbital parameters ) .",
    "each realization was fit with a keplerian model , allowing calculation of the standard deviation of each orbital parameter .",
    "these are adopted as the 1@xmath43 uncertainties , as listed in table 2 .",
    "note that these quoted uncertainties do not incorporate the uncertainty in the massof the star itself .",
    "the keplerian fit yields residuals with a standard deviation of 5.26 , consistent with the expected errors and the rms for the comparison m dwarfs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "similarly , the fit yields @xmath40 = 1.00 , indicating that the keplerian model from a single planet is adequate to explain the velocities .",
    "the eccentricity of 0.12 @xmath23 0.06 is nearly consistent with a circular orbit .",
    "tidal coupling is expected for such a close planet , with an especially short circularization time scale if the planet is partially solid .",
    "we attempted fits to the velocities using the simplest model , notably one with an assumed circular orbit and no allowed velocity trend .",
    "such models have only three free parameters and the best ",
    "fit circular orbit model is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the resulting best  fit circular orbit has @xmath14  =  2.644 d ,",
    "@xmath44  =  14.0 , and @xmath1= 0.052 m@xmath9 , implying a mass slightly smaller than that found in the eccentric  orbit model with a trend .",
    "the circular orbit model ( no trend ) yielded residuals with rms = 6.8 and @xmath40 = 1.25 , both somewhat larger than those found from the eccentric model , but not a large enough difference to rule it out .",
    "we then fit the velocities with a keplerian having non  zero eccentricity , but no trend , which yielded @xmath45= 1.20 and @xmath15 = 0.11 .",
    "finally , we fit the velocities with a circular orbit , but leaving the trend floating , which yielded rms = 6.19 and @xmath45= 1.15 , and gave @xmath1= 0.052 m@xmath9 .",
    "this model consisting of a circular orbit with floating trend reduces @xmath45  to a level that is near enough that achieved with the eccentricity allowed to float that we can not rule out a circular orbit .",
    "thus , a circular orbit remains plausible and implies a lower planet mass , @xmath1= 16.5 m@xmath46 .",
    "the keplerian fit to the velocities yields an acceptable value of @xmath45  =   1.03 when including a velocity trend , and yields nearly as acceptable a value , @xmath45  =   1.23 , when carrying out a fit with only a circular orbit and no trend .",
    "nonetheless , one might be concerned that the plethora of possible orbits of short periods , less than @xmath810 d , might permit random fluctuations to yield such low values of @xmath39 by chance .",
    "we tested the hypothesis that the velocities are merely uncorrelated noise such that the keplerian fit yields a low @xmath39 due merely to fluctuations of that noise .",
    "we have carried out two tests of this null hypothesis , one using the f  statistic and the other with monte carlo simulations of scrambled velocities .",
    "the f  test is described by ford ( 2004 ) , cumming ( 2004 ) and marcy et al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "the improvement in @xmath39 between a model that assumes no planet and one that includes a keplerian orbit , @xmath47 , can be assessed for the probability that such improvement would occur by chance fluctuations .",
    "we form the ratio @xmath48 which follows the f distribution ( bevington & robinson 2002 , cumming 2004 ) and permits assessment of the probability that this ratio departs from 0.0 due to fluctuations alone . that probability corresponds to the false alarm probability ( fap ) for the best ",
    "fit keplerian model .",
    "each independent frequency ( 1 / orbital period ) can harbor such fluctuations .",
    "we therefore determine the number of independent frequencies ( periods ) by constructing an interval between them such that a phase difference of one full cycle accrues during the entire time series ( cumming 2004 ) .",
    "this f  test is essentially identical to the computation of fap from a periodogram analysis . in our test , however , a keplerian model , rather than a sinusoid , is compared to the no  planet model .",
    "we applied this test to gj  436 .",
    "we find that the probability that @xmath45  improved due to mere fluctuations of noise from 2.57 ( no planet ) to 1.03 ( keplerian plus trend ) is less than 1@xmath4910@xmath50 .",
    "we thus find it unlikely that noise fluctuations can account for the low @xmath45found from the keplerian model .",
    "the f  test can not properly account for the non  uniform sampling of the velocities nor the non  gaussian nature of the velocity errors .",
    "therefore , we have carried out another test of fap that involves scrambling the velocities , as if they were uncorrelated noise , and recomputing a keplerian fit for each scrambled realization of the data . in this way",
    ", we determine the distribution of @xmath39 that is expected if the velocities were simply uncorrelated noise .",
    "we scrambled the velocities , keeping the times of observation the same . for each of 1000 realizations , we searched for the best ",
    "fit keplerian model and recorded its associated value of @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting histogram of @xmath40 is shown in figure 7 and shows the distribution expected if the measured velocities were simply uncorrelated noise .",
    "the distribution peaks at @xmath40 = 2.05 with a width , fwhm = 0.3 .",
    "none of the 1000 trials of scrambled velocities yielded a value of @xmath40 below the best ",
    "fit @xmath40 of 1.03 from the original velocities .",
    "thus , if the measured velocities are simply noise , the probability is @xmath251/1000 that the value of @xmath51 for the best ",
    "fit keplerian orbit planet would be caused by chance fluctuations .",
    "moreover the distribution of @xmath40 from scrambled velocities is so well separated from the value of @xmath40 from the original velocities ( figure 7 ) , that the fap is likely to be significantly less than 0.001 , consistent with the even lower fap value found from the f  test .",
    "this robust monte carlo analysis suggests directly that fluctuations in uncorrelated noise can not account for the low @xmath39 from the keplerian fit . with a stellar sample of 150",
    "m dwarfs on the keck planet search , the probability is low that such chance fluctuations might arise in any one of the m dwarfs .",
    "thus , the velocities appear inconsistent with the hypothesis that the high quality of the keplerian fit stems merely from chance fluctuations .",
    "we also considered that systematic errors might account for the velocity variations seen in gj  436 .",
    "we have computed periodograms from our velocity measurements of the other 150 m dwarfs obtained with hires during the past four years .",
    "none shows a periodicity anywhere near a period of 2.6 d with any amplitude close to the 18 seen here .",
    "thus , we see no evidence of any instrumental source of a 2.6day periodicity . for the same reason ,",
    "no other m dwarfs reveal any evidence of intrinsic _ astrophysical _ periodicities at that period . similarly , the other 1100 fgk stars on our keck planet  search program show no evidence of 2.6day periodicities .",
    "indeed , the shortest period planet found on this program is that of hd 46375 with a period of 3.02 d , rendering the 2.6day period of gj  436 clearly extraordinary in our doppler planet survey",
    ".    one conceivable source of periodicity is the rotation of the star that could modify the spectrum due to any inhomogeneities on the stellar surface .",
    "however , we see no photometric periodicity in gj  436 at periods near 2.64 d ( figure 8) at millimag levels .",
    "this lack of brightness variations suggests the absence of large spots and active regions distributed non  uniformly over the photosphere , with limits on the covering factor of under 1% .",
    "the star clearly has a chromosphere , as seen in the h & k  emission ( figure 1 ) , which is likely distributed in patches over magnetic regions .",
    "however , the doppler information in optical spectra comes from the photosphere which apparently has uniform surface brightness , with fluctuations no more than 1% judging from the constant photometry .",
    "if the 2.644day doppler period were the rotation period of star , the implied equatorial velocity would be 7.3 ( by adopting a stellar radius of 0.38 r@xmath5 ) ( chabrier & baraffe 2000 ) .",
    "such a large equatorial velocity could be detectable in the rotational broadening of the absorption lines .",
    "we compared the widths of the lines in gj  436 to those in a comparison star , gj 411 which has v@xmath52 2 ( chen and marcy 1992 ) .",
    "we find that the lines in gj  436 are no broader than those in gj 411 , giving an upper limit of 3 on v@xmath53 .",
    "thus the hypothesis that gj  436 is rotating at nearly 7.3 appears to be unlikely .",
    "stellar rotation seems unlikely to be the cause of the doppler periodicity at @xmath14 = 2.644 d.",
    "queloz et al . ( 2001 ) and paulson et al . ( 2004 ) have shown that photospheric features such as spots and plages on solar - type stars can result in low - amplitude , periodic radial velocity variations capable of mimicing the presence of a planetary companion",
    ". therefore , precision photometric measurements are an important complement to doppler observations and can help to establish whether the radial velocity variations are caused by stellar magnetic activity or planetary - reflex motion , e.g. , henry et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "photometric observations can also detect possible transits of the planetary companions and so allow the determination of their radii and true masses , e.g. , henry et al.(2000b ) .",
    "we have observed gj  436 with the t12 0.8  m automatic photometric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory between 2003 november and 2004 june and obtained a total of 226 brightness measurements .",
    "the t12 apt is equipped with a two - channel precision photometer employing two emi 9124qb bi - alkali photomultiplier tubes to make simultaneous measurements in the strmgren @xmath54 and @xmath55 passbands .",
    "the apt measures the difference in brightness between a program star and a nearby constant comparison star with a typical precision of 0.0015 mag for bright stars ( @xmath56 ) . for gj  436",
    ", we used the comparison star hd  102555 ( @xmath31 = 7.24 , @xmath57 = 0.39 , f2 ) , which was shown to be constant to 0.002 mag or better by comparison with the second comparison star hd  103676 ( @xmath31 = 6.79 , @xmath57 = 0.38 , f2 ) .",
    "we reduced our strmgren @xmath54 and @xmath55 differential magnitudes with nightly extinction coefficients and transformed them to the strmgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients .",
    "further information on the telescope , photometer , observing procedures , and data reduction techniques employed with the t12 apt can be found in henry ( 1999 ) and in eaton , henry , & fekel ( 2003 ) .",
    "the 226 combined @xmath58 differential magnitudes of gj  436 are plotted in the top panel of figure  8 .",
    "the observations are phased with the planetary orbital period and a time of inferior conjunction , computed from the orbital elements in table  2 .",
    "the standard deviation of the observations from the mean brightness level is 0.0043 mag , larger than the typical 0.0015 mag precision with the t12 apt , because gj  436 , at @xmath31 = 10.67 , is much fainter than the typical star observed with this telescope . by averaging the strmgren @xmath54 and @xmath55 observations into a single passband",
    ", we gained a factor of square root 2 in our precision , improving our sensitivity to any intrinsic stellar variability .",
    "period analysis does not reveal any periodicity between 1 and 100 days .",
    "a least - squares sine fit of the observations phased to the radial velocity period gives a semi - amplitude of 0.00044 @xmath23 0.00037 mag .",
    "thus starspots are unlikely to be the cause of the velocity periodicity .",
    "if the star were pulsating with a velocity amplitude of 18 , the difference between its minimum and maximum radius would be 1300 km , yielding a fractional change in disk size of 0.005 .",
    "thus , the observed very low limit to possible photometric variability supports planetary - reflex motion as the cause of the radial velocity variations . note that even if the planet were as large as jupiter , it would intercept only 3@xmath4910@xmath59 of the star s radiation .",
    "the observations near phase 0.0 are replotted with an expanded abscissa in the bottom panel of figure  8 .",
    "the solid curve in each of the two panels approximates the predicted transit light curve assuming a planetary orbital inclination of 90  ( central transits ) .",
    "the out - of - transit light level corresponds to the mean brightness of the observations .",
    "the transit duration is calculated from the orbital elements .",
    "four different transit depths are estimated from an assumed stellar radius of 0.41 r@xmath60 , a planetary mass of 1.2 m@xmath61 , and planetary radii of 0.5 , 0.35 , 0.31 , and 0.24 r@xmath62 , corresponding to planetary models of a gas giant without a core , a gas giant with a core , an ice / rock planet , and a planet composed of pure iron , respectively .",
    "the horizontal bar below the predicted transit window in the bottom panel represents the approximate uncertainty in the time of mid transit , based on monte carlo simulations and the uncertainties in the orbital elements .",
    "the vertical error bar to the right of the transit window corresponds to the @xmath23 0.0043 mag measurement uncertainties for a single observation .",
    "the geometric probablility of transits is 6.8% , computed from equation 1 of seagroves et al .",
    "( 2003 ) assuming random orbital inclinations .",
    "the mean of the 8 observations within the transit window agrees with the mean of the 218 observations outside the window to within 0.0010 mag , just as expected from the precision of the observations .",
    "thus , central transits for the four planetary models given above would produce transit depths of 17 , 8 , 7 , and 4 sigma , respectively . although the uncertainty in the time of mid transit is somewhat larger than the duration of possible transits , the observations nonetheless rule out the possibility of complete ( as opposed to grazing ) transits except possibly for shallow events occuring around phase 0.99 for a planet with a rocky or iron composition . since the planet lies at a distance of 14 stellar radii , the inclination of the orbit must be less than about 86 .",
    "the radial velocities of gj  436 exhibit a marked periodicity , consistent with a keplerian orbit of a planetary - mass companion .",
    "no other interpretation , such as stellar oscillations or rotational modulation of surface inhomogeneities , seems likely to explain the 2.6 d periodicity .",
    "the implied keplerian orbit has a period of 2.644 d , an orbital semimajor axis of 0.0278 au , and an orbital eccentricity of 0.12 that is marginally consistent with circular .    the stellar mass of 0.41 m@xmath19implies a minimum planet mass , @xmath1 , of 0.067 m@xmath2or 1.2 m@xmath63 .",
    "this minimum mass is considerably lower than that of any extrasolar planet previously found ( pulsar planets aside ) .",
    "the lowest previously found planet , as of this writing , had been that of hd 49674 with @xmath1= 0.11 m@xmath2(butler et al .",
    "2003 ) . for randomly oriented orbits ,",
    "the average value of @xmath53 is @xmath64 and it is probable that @xmath65 .",
    "thus it is likely that this planet has a mass less than 2 m@xmath3 .",
    "a planet of roughly neptune mass orbiting 0.028 au from an m dwarf raises several new issues about its constitution .",
    "we could not rule out the possibility of a solid rock or rock  ice composition , nor a primarily ice  rock body with a significant hydrogen envolope reminiscent of neptune and uranus in our solar system .",
    "indeed , one wonders if a gaseous envelope can be ruled out for this planet on the basis of its survival against uv energy deposition from the young , magnetic m dwarf .",
    "the uncertainty in its composition leaves a range of plausible radii for the planet , from 0.2  1.0 r@xmath9(especially for arbitrary orbital inclinations ) , leaving uncertain the amount of dimming expected by transits .",
    "the planet intercepts 3 @xmath49 10@xmath59 of the star s radiation , if it has the radius of jupiter",
    ". this would be the amplitude of reflected light variations if the planet s albedo were unity and the orbit were edge  on .",
    "after submission of this paper , another neptune - mass planet ( @xmath1= 0.82 m@xmath63 ) emerged from doppler measurements made by the hobby eberly telescope and lick observatory ( mcarthur et al . 2004 ) . orbiting 55 cancri ( g8  v ) , this other neptune raises similar questions about its origin , migration , and composition .",
    "the existence of two planets having @xmath1near the mass of neptune drastically reduces the already remote statistical possibility that face  on orbital inclinations explain the low values of @xmath1for them .",
    "instead , it is likely that a population of neptune  mass planets exists that is the extension of the rising mass function already known toward lower planetary masses .",
    "from its @xmath21  of 10.63 and expected bolometric correction of 1.9 , the luminosity of gj  436 is @xmath66  =  0.025 l@xmath19 . at its orbital distance of 0.028",
    "au , the expected surface temperature is @xmath8 620 k , depending on its albedo , greenhouse effects , and uniform illumination , all of which are questionable .",
    "most metals and refractory material remain solid at such a temperature which is similar to that on the surface of venus .",
    "insignificant mass loss would occur from the tail of the maxwell  boltzmann distribution of hydrogen .",
    "however , a detailed calculation is required to determine the mass loss from the planet due to high  energy stellar radiation from flares and the corona , especially during first billion years of enhanced magnetic activity on the star .",
    "the possibility of roche  lobe overflow ( in either direction ) especially during pre ",
    "main  sequence evolution , should also be considered .",
    "tidal coupling must be computed to determine if the planet keeps one hemisphere toward the star .",
    "if the planet were mostly solid , questions would be raised about the temperature on both the back side and on the terminator .",
    "this star is just the second m dwarf known to harbor a planet , the first being two  planet system around gj 876 ( marcy et al .",
    "2001 ) . at a distance of 10.2 pc , gj  436 is a prime target for the space interferometry mission ( sim ) to detect the astrometric wobble and place limits on @xmath53 and hence the planet mass .",
    "coronagraphic imaging missions from the ground and space should attempt to image planets residing farther from this star , especially because of the velocity trend that seems to be preferred in our model .",
    "we find that giant planets are rare among m dwarfs . among the 150 m dwarfs in our keck survey",
    ", this star is only the second found to have a planet despite three years of surveying them with high doppler precision of 3 .",
    "the low mass of this new planet highlights our ability to detect planets of somewhat higher mass , 0.3 m@xmath2or greater within 1 au ( @xmath671.5 yr ) during which time at least two orbits would have transpired .",
    "however , only one m dwarf has revealed such a jupiter ",
    "sized planet around an m dwarf .",
    "thus , the occurrence rate of jupiter  mass planets within 1 au of m dwarfs appears to be 1/150  @xmath37  0.7% .",
    "in contrast , among our 1180 fgk stars surveyed at the lick , keck , and aat telescopes , 41 have a planet within 1 au .",
    "thus , for nearby fgk stars , the occurrence rate of jupiter  mass planets ( 0.5  @xmath68  13 m@xmath2 ) within 1 au is 3.5% ( marcy et al .",
    "thus , the occurrence of jupiters orbiting near m dwarfs appears to be a factor of @xmath8  5 below that of solar  mass stars .",
    "this paucity of giant planets around m dwarfs is consistent with , but not required by , the planet ",
    "formation models of levison , lissauer , & duncan ( 1998 ) and of alibert , mordasini , & benz ( 2004 ) .",
    "lower mass protoplanetary disks around m dwarfs may have been important in slowing the accretion rate , yielding lower  mass planets ( laughlin et al .",
    "2004 ) . indeed , the formation of neptune in our solar system is not well understood and may have been influenced by the low surface mass density in the outer solar nebula ( lissauer et al .",
    "1995 ; bryden , lin , & ida 2000 ; thommes , duncan , & levison 2002 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the occurrence of jupiters is a function of stellar mass .",
