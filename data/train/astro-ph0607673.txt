    "radio observations are an excellent way to identify star - forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , being subject to fewer selection effects than optical surveys ( e.g.  obscuration ; spectral line contamination ) . until recently a large fraction of the most distant known galaxies had first been detected in radio surveys , their nature betrayed by steep radio spectra and faint optical / infrared ( opt / ir ) counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the discovery by @xcite that 3c  295  an object we shall meet later in this paper  lies at @xmath5 ( at that time the most distant known object ) was due to its initial detection at 159  mhz and a photometric redshift prediction by @xcite of the kind that is now commonplace ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "wide , low - frequency surveys such as 3cr tend to yield associations with bright ellipticals ( radio galaxies ) and a smattering of radio quasars and bl lacs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas at higher frequencies ( e.g.  5  ghz ) radio quasars become more common . at lower flux densities , around 1  mjy ,",
    "the source counts steepen : evidence of either primeval radio galaxies @xcite or that the star - forming galaxies play an increasingly important role @xcite .",
    "indeed , for low radio luminosities ( @xmath6  w  hz@xmath7 ) @xcite argue that the fraction of agn in radio - selected samples drops to around 10% , as revealed via an excess of radio emission above that predicted by the far - ir / radio correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all of these agn also reveal their nuclear activity in the mid - infrared or x - ray wavebands .",
    "determining the nature of faint radio sources is non - trivial . even the first step",
    " obtaining optical or ir identifications  can be time consuming , a task that ultimately yields little but a slit position for spectroscopic follow up and a very basic measure of stellar mass and star - formation rate , both subject to obscuration by dust for galaxies at high redshift .",
    "this paper presents moderately - deep radio observations of the extended groth strip ( egs ) obtained at a wavelength of 6  cm using the very large array .",
    "deeper observations at 20  cm have been obtained @xcite , but this paper gives an overview of the counterparts of the bright population , those sources we expect to be dominated by agn .",
    "for distant galaxies , the rest - frame near - ir observations provided by _ spitzer _",
    "enable relatively easy identifications and the best possible measure of stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence of the likely evolutionary state of a radio galaxy .    throughout this paper ,",

    "we chose to image the egs with the vla at 6  cm instead of 20  cm because the bright radio source 3c  295 is located nearby at ra=14@xmath10 09@xmath11 3349 and dec=52  26  130 ( j2000 ) , only 85 from the southwest corner of the spitzer coverage in the egs . at 6  cm ,",
    "contamination levels are much lower than at 20  cm because 3c  295 is a factor of 3.5 times fainter and 3.3 times farther away in terms of the primary beam size .",
    "the shorter observing wavelength makes this survey relatively more sensitive to flat - spectrum radio sources than a 20  cm survey would be .",

    "each pointing center was observed for 15 minutes .",
    "the observations were carried out in continuum mode with two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , each 50 mhz wide , centered at 4885 and 4835  mhz . the point source vcs2 j1400 + 6210 ( = 4c  62.22 ) was observed for 2 minutes every 17 minutes to provide phase calibrations .",

    "this size is similar to the irac fwhm of 1720 @xcite .",
    "we also imaged a small region at the location of 3c  295 and found no residual flux with an rms noise of 67  @xmath18jy / beam .",

    "was then checked in the original images ( not mosaics ) , and sources below 10@xmath1 were removed from the list .",
    "this conservative detection limit was needed to avoid spurious sources ; many 5@xmath1 bumps are real , but many are sidelobes caused by the limited uv coverage .",
    "many radio surveys with better sensitivity are available , including in the egs @xcite , and the purpose of this paper is best served by maximizing reliability .",

    "trials with random positions suggest about 1.5% chance of an irac source within 08 of a given position ; i.e. , zero to one of the irac counterparts may be spurious on this basis .",
    "however , most of the proposed counterparts have flux densities well above the irac survey limit , and spurious matches involving such bright sources are far less likely .",
    "of five possible source pairs with irac coverage ( second part of table  1 ) , the two pairs with radio morphology of classical doubles both have an irac source between the two radio components , as expected . thus for 33 `` easy '' cases , we find irac counterparts for 30 , an identification rate of 91% .    the three additional radio source pairs are more difficult to assess .",
    "source  26 is pointlike , but the nearby northern radio source ( # 27 ) shows multiple sub - components . an irac source is 41 northeast of the southern radio source .",
    "( see figure  [ f : doubles ] . )",
    "we consider this a valid counterpart to a likely radio double , despite the irac galaxy not being centered between the two radio sources .",
    "radio sources 39/40 have wide separation , and there are additional , faint irac sources in the field .",

    "while these three identifications are uncertain , they wo nt change subsequent conclusions of this paper .",
    "irac positions are listed in table  3 .    the high identification rate ( @xmath1690% ) in the infrared contrasts with a much lower rate that would be found in visible light .",
    "only 24 radio sources have @xmath22 counterparts in the deep2 catalog ( @xmath3 , @xcite ; see also @xcite and http://deep.berkeley.edu/ ) , and of these , only 12 are brighter than @xmath23 .",
    "the faintness of the counterparts to 5  ghz radio sources found here contrasts with the results of a 1.4  ghz survey @xcite , where half the radio sources were found to have visible counterparts with @xmath24 .",

    "in contrast , we find counterparts that bright in @xmath27 for only 14 of the egs radio sources ( with @xmath28  mjy ) .",
    "considering that the radio surveys have different depths , different wavelengths , different counterpart identification criteria , and are done in different regions of sky , there are probably no major inconsistencies in the fraction of counterparts optically identified .",

    "( the mips images are also described by @xcite . )",
    "a center position was measured on whichever image offered the best signal to noise ratio ( usually 3.6  but sometimes longer wavelengths ) , and the iraf task apphot was used to measure flux in a 52 diameter beam .",

    "many of the counterparts have very red visible to mid - infrared colors , underscoring the difficulty of identification at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the radio sources are likely to arise from powerful agn , but only about 25% show a typical agn power - law component that dominates the mid - infrared emission . for about 70% of the counterparts , galaxy starlight dominates the mid - infrared emission .",
    "the starlight - dominated galaxies can be identified by their blue @xmath41-[8.0]$ ] irac colors .",
    "these `` blue clump '' galaxies show a small range of apparent magnitude , suggesting a relatively small range of redshift for this galaxy type in this survey .",
    "the small range is probably a combination of the radio survey sensitivity limit and relative rarity at low redshift of galaxies hosting powerful radio sources . the separation into `` stripe '' and `` blue clump '' galaxies should be useful in classifying galaxies found in other radio surveys .",
