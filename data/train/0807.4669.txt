    "( 2005 ) did . in this paper",
    "we will focus on cdfs 46 .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) has interpreted the x - ray emission line in cdfs 46 as relativistic blueshifted iron k line intrinsic to the quasar at @xmath2 = 1.617 ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "we noticed that basu ( 2006 ) proposed a different scenario to interpret the optical and x - ray spectrum of cdfs 46 .",
    "he suggested that all the optical and x - ray emission lines are blueshifted , resulting from an ejection .",
    "however , we find this scenario is unacceptable due to several reasons .",
    "first , all the emission lines were identified to have negative redshift , i.e. , the observed optical emission lines were identified as infrared lines in the rest frame .",
    "however , such extremely unusual galaxies with high blueshifts have never been reported .",
    "furthermore , the identification of three optical emission lines yields a redshift / blueshift scatter of 2.8% , significantly larger than 0.8% we obtained .",
    "the scatter ( corresponding to 8400 km / s ) is even larger than the full width of the broadest emission line identified in cdfs46 ( see fig",
    ". 6 of szokoly et al .",
    "finally , the strong x - ray emission line was classified as s k@xmath31 , which is supposed to be rather weak , and has never been detected before .",
    "it s interesting to note that in the goods - s acs images , a nearby fainter galaxy ( @xmath32 = 24.7 ) is detected , 1.1  to the southwest of the quasar cdfs 46 .",
    "we note that the possibility to have a random galaxy brighter than @xmath32 = 24.7 within 1.1  to certain known galaxy in goods - s is only 4% , suggesting that the two galaxies are likely at the same redshift .",
    "vlt / fors spectroscopy observations have classified the nearby fainter galaxy as an emission line galaxy at redshift 1.609 based on the detection of [ oii ] 3727 , and photometric measurements ( vanzella et al .",
    "this is within 0.5% to the redshift of cdfs 46 ( @xmath2 = 1.617 ) and mgii emission lines , see wang et al .",
    "2003 ; szokoly et al . 2004 . ] .",
    "this provides further evidence showing the redshift measurement of cdfs 46 is reliable .",
    "cdfs 11 is not covered by goods acs images .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) has listed several possible explanations to the unusual strong emission line in cdfs 46 , including iron emission line from a relativistic outflow intrinsic to the quasar , strong iron absorption edge due to a cold relativistic outflow , or intervening low - redshift ( @xmath2 @xmath5 0.034 ) type 2 agn . in the high spatial resolution goods",
    "acs images , only cdfs 46 at @xmath2 = 1.617 and a nearby galaxy at @xmath2 = 1.609 ( 1.1apart ) are visible within 3.5  radius . also , although strong fe k@xmath31 line from neutral iron at 6.4 kev is not unusual in type 2 agn , variation in the line central energy is not expected , contrary to what find in cdfs 46 .",
    "these facts firmly rule out an intervening low - redshift type 2 agn .    as wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) stated , the emission line feature could also be statistically fitted by a blueshifted strong fe absorption edge due to cold outflow .",
    "spectral fitting to the 2 ms spectrum shows that a heavy absorption ( with @xmath33 = 3.2@xmath26 @xmath20 10@xmath34 @xmath22 ) , covering 99.92@xmath35% of the direct continuum , is required .",
    "statistically we can not rule out this model based on the 2ms exposure , however , we point out that , in addition to a compton - thick cold outflow with a velocity of 0.65c , such a model can only work under more extreme conditions .",
    "these include that , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of cdfs 46 needs to be @xmath36 500 times larger ( l@xmath37 @xmath5 3.0 @xmath20 10@xmath38 erg / s ) , which is way too luminous for its radio and optical emission obtained under this model is 0.2 . ] ; the leaking x - ray emission ( or scattered x - ray emission ) can not exceed 0.12% ; the cold outflow needs to slow down from 0.69c to 0.65c after 2.7 years ( in the quasar rest frame ) , and have to be locate at a large distance from the unusual strong central continuum , to avoid to be ionized , otherwise we would see strong soft x - ray emission which is free from absorption by an ionized absorber . assuming a density of 10@xmath39 @xmath40 , which is typical of the broad line region in agn , we obtained a distance @xmath41 @xmath14 @xmath42 cm from the central emission . assuming the outflow cloud has a round or square shape , the outflow rate is then @xmath43 @xmath44 yr@xmath10 , which is higher than the eddington accretion rate @xmath45 m@xmath46 yr@xmath10 of a 10@xmath47 solar mass black hole , even for a very small covering factor of the outflow @xmath48 @xmath5 10@xmath49 .",
    "therefor , the line feature we detected is most plausibly blueshifted iron line due to a relativistic outflow intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "the doppler factor of 2.2 ( for h- like fe@xmath50 k@xmath51 , 6.97 kev ) implies bulk velocity of @xmath50.65c ( head - on ) that must be responsible for the blueshift and relativistic boosting intensity . assuming a lower ionization state",
    "would yields higher velocity up - to 0.7c ( for neutral fe k@xmath52 line ) .",
    "if the line is due to fluorescent emission or recombination emission from plasma ionized by x - ray continuum , the continuum must illuminate the outflow from sides to produce strong line with equivalent width above several kev . in this case , the equivalent width of the line can be boosted by a factor of df@xmath53 , where df means the doppler factor for the bulk motion , and @xmath54 the photon index of the x - ray continuum .",
    "if the outflow is not ionized by the central x - ray emission , considering the recombination timescale for fe@xmath55 is @xmath56 s ( allen 1973 , here t@xmath57 is the temperature in unit of 10@xmath58 k , and n@xmath59 the electron density in unit of @xmath60@xmath40 . ) , typically in the range between 4.4@xmath61 and 4.4 s ( chartas , et al .",
    "2002 ) , there must be some mechanics ( such as magnetic driving ) which keep heating the relativistic outflow .",
    "migliari , fender , & mendez ( 2002 ) had reported the discovery of blueshifted and very strong iron emission lines ( with velocity of 0.26c and equivalent width of 13 kev , migliari , private communication ) from extended x - ray emission in the x - ray binary system ss 433 .",
    "their discovery implied the existence of large - scale reheating of baryon , which may work for the extreme blueshifted iron line in cdfs 46 .",
    "we note that the new hetg observation of ss 433 also shows relativistic red- and blue- shifted lines from the central part indicating two side relativistic jets ( marshall et al .",
    "2002 , lopez et al .",
    "2006 ) . taking the velocity of the outflow as 0.70c",
    ", the distance which the outflow travelled during the 7 years observation gap is @xmath62 pc = 1.8@xmath63 cm ( in the quasar rest frame ) , which is @xmath55 times the dust sublimation radius ( @xmath640.13 pc , here l@xmath65 is the intrinsic 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity in unit of @xmath66 erg s@xmath10 . ) .",
    "the distance is too large for an adiabatic cooling process except for the existence of reheating ( migliari , fender , & mendez 2002 ) .",
    "the marginal change in the observed line central energy can either be due to a slow down of the outflow ( from 0.69c to 0.65c for h - like fe k@xmath31 line ) , or a change of the ionization state , for example , from h - like fe k@xmath31 dominated to he - line fe k@xmath31 dominated ( see table 3 ) . in the former case ,",
    "we expect weaker emission line due to the weaker boosting effect , which is consistent with observation ( see fig 1 and table 3 ) . in the later case , the line could either goes stronger or weaker , depending on the exact ionization state .",
    "we note that chartas et al .",
    "( 2007a ) discovered 0.92-yr and 5.9-day ( rest frame ) variability of the outflowing absorbing gas , with velocity of @xmath50.1c ( 0.05c ) and @xmath50.4c ( 0.36c ) due to he - like fe k@xmath51 ( h - like fe k@xmath51 ) resonant absorption , in the large gravitational lensed bal quasar pg 1115@xmath680 .",
    "our two quasars are among the several agns which show x - ray outflows with velocity @xmath67 0.4 c ( see table 1 ) . considering the large number of x - ray spectra obtained for quasars with advanced x - ray telescopes such as xmm and chandra , why there are only several sources show relativistic outflowing features in their x - ray spectra ? we contribute this to the orientation and observational selection effect .",
    "the broad absorption line outflow in quasars , with velocity up - to 0.1c , is believed to have a sky coverage of 20% .",
    "we propose that relativistic outflow with velocity @xmath68c has similar or smaller sky coverage , thus can only be detected in a small fraction of quasars .",
    "the instrumental bandpass , such as _ chandra _ ( 0.310 kev ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( 0.312 kev ) , also limits the detection of relativistic outflowing features to certain redshift range .",
    "assuming a doppler factor @xmath672 ( or a bulk velocity of @xmath670.6 c ) , only h- like fe k@xmath51 line at redshift above 1.0 can be detected below 7 kev in the observed frame ( where _ chandra _ & _ xmm _ are sensitive to detect enough counts ) . furthermore , to confirm an emission or absorption line feature in an x - ray spectrum requires high number of detected photons ( more than several hundreds ) ,",
    "thus they can only be detected in luminous sources or by long enough exposure .",
    "we have stated above that the strong blueshifted emission line could be possibly due to line emission from collimated jets .",
    "it s interesting to note that all the three sources presenting blueshifted emission lines in table 1 are radio - loud , suggesting the blueshifted emission lines and jets are somehow connected .",
    "historically , in additional to jet , the most dominant examples of agn outflows have been found in broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) , which show absorption troughs in uv and optical lines with velocities up to tens of thousands of km s@xmath10 ( as large as 0.2 c , e.g. , hidalgo et al .",
    "disk wind model is one of most popular model to bal outflows ( see proga 2007 ) , and the presence of x - ray shielding gas is required to prevent the gas from over ionization and attenuate the x - ray continuum as observed ( with @xmath33 @xmath69 @xmath22 , gallagher & everett , 2007 ) .",
    "we propose that the innermost region of the x - ray shielding gas could be outflowing at a higher velocity ( such as 0.6 @xmath5 0.7 c ) , and more ionized , which produces no photo - electric but he - like and h - like iron absorption to central x - ray continuum .",
    "actually , chartas et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 2003 ; 2007a ; 2007b ) have identified blueshifted x - ray absorption features in bal qsos at higher velocities and higher ionization level ( see table 1 ) .",
    "an iron absorption line is produced when our line of sight is covered by the innermost shielding gas , and an emission line is observed when our line of sight is not covered but close to the outflowing direction ( see fig .",
    "[ diag ] ) . note the most recent simulation work of sim et al .",
    "( 2008 ) shows a similar and clear pattern that outflow can produce both iron absorption and emission features , depending on the viewing angle . taking into account the relativistic boosting effect , the blueshifted fe k",
    "emission line can be seen at a significant level .",
    "the innermost region of the x - ray shielding gas might have sky coverage different from the broad absorption line region , thus the presence of x - ray absorption or emission line features does not necessarily link to the presence of broad absorption line in optical / uv band .",
    "however , it s worth to look for possible blueshifted optical / uv features in cdfs 46 and cdfs 11 , which requires optical spectra with much higher quality . on the other hand , the search for blueshifted x - ray features in high s / n x - ray spectra of bal qsos",
    "would also be helpful .",
    "finally , we note that bal outflow could be aligned with jets , at least in some bal qsos , and they might be physically connected ( e.g. see wang et al .",
    "this suggest that both mechanisms ( jet or bal outflow ) could probably work simultaneously to produce blueshifted emission / absorption lines with @xmath70 @xmath14 0.4c in the x - ray spectra of quasars .",

    "<S> in this paper , we provide new 1 ms @xmath0 acis spectra of two quasars in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) , which were previously reported to show strong and extremely blueshifted x - ray emission / absorption line features in previous 1 ms spectra , with outflowing bulk velocity @xmath10.65 - 0.84c . in the new 1 ms spectra , the relativistic blueshifted line feature is solidly confirmed in cxo cdfs j033225.3 - 274219 ( cdfs 46 , @xmath2 = 1.617 ) , and marginally visible in cxo cdfs j033260.0 - 274748 ( cdfs 11 , @xmath2 = 2.579 ) , probably due to the increased chandra acis background in the new 1 ms exposure . </S>",
    "<S> the new data rule out the possibility ( though very tiny already based on the old 1ms data ) that the two sources were selected to be unusual due to noise spikes in the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the only likely interpretation is extremely blueshifted iron absorption / emission line or absorption edge due to relativistic outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rest frame emission line center in cdfs 46 marginally decreased from 16.2 kev to 15.2 kev after 7 years . </S>",
    "<S> the line shift can be due to either decreasing outflowing velocity or lower ionization level . </S>",
    "<S> including the two quasars reported in this paper , we collect from literature a total of 7 quasars showing blueshifted emission or absorption line feature with @xmath3 in x - ray spectra , and discuss its connection to jet and/or bal ( broad absorption line ) outflow . </S>"
