    "the dendritic pattern is observed in various systems , such as crystallization@xcite and electrodeposition@xcite .",
    "it has been one of the most typical and ubiquitous in nonlinear and nonequilibrium physics .",
    "a dendritic pattern has a stem with the tip growing stably and steadily , without splitting .",
    "countless sidebranches grow behind the tip due to noise @xcite and instability of a flat interface@xcite .",
    "these sidebranches compete with the ones around them .",
    "a longer sidebranch screens off growth of the shorter ones around it .",
    "the competition repeats on various length scale , complicated and hierarchical structures are formed @xcite and the pattern becomes fractal as a whole .",
    "the growth process of a dendritic pattern is mainly dominated by diffusion and anisotropy . the dendritic pattern is often compared with the diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla)@xcite pattern , for which the growth process is also dominated by diffusion . however , there is no anisotropy in the dla growth process and the dla pattern is formed through repeat of tip - splitting . it has been reported for an electrodeposition experiment that a transition between dendritic pattern and dla pattern is observed as the electrolyte concentration and applied voltage are varied@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dendritic pattern can be formed artificially by introducing anisotropy into isotropic viscous fingering @xcite and , on the other hand , the dla pattern by removing the anisotropy from an anisotropic crystal growth process@xcite .",
    "the scaling structure and fractality of dendritic pattern have been interesting and important issues for quantitative characterization .",
    "it has been reported that the area fractal dimension @xmath1 of a dendritic pattern with fourfold symmetry is 1.5 - 1.6 for a noise - reduced dla simulation on a square lattice@xcite and @xmath2 crystal growth@xcite .",
    "it is clearly less than that of the dla , @xmath31.71 .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the tip is stabilized against splitting by anisotropy .",
    "mathematically the lower bound of the fractal dimension for the dla on a square lattice is proved to be 3/2 @xcite .    to characterize a pattern in more detail ,",
    "the fractal dimension alone is insufficient .",
    "for the dla , the growth rate distribution on the interface is found to have multifractality in the cases of a simulation@xcite , a crystallization experiment@xcite , and a conformal mapping model@xcite . in the present article",
    ", we investigate the scaling structure of the growth rate distribution , especially compared with that of the dla .",
    "we evaluate the growth rate distribution numerically , and implement the similar multifractal analysis for a dendritic pattern formed in @xmath0 crystallization experiment , where the surface tension is effective within a certain length scale .",
    "we use an @xmath0 solution growth dendritic crystal with well - developed sidebranches .",
    "the details of our experiment are described in ref.@xcite : an @xmath0 aqueous solution saturated at approximately @xmath4 is sealed , with a nucleation seed left in it , in a hele - shaw cell , a narrow space between two glass plates .",
    "the thickness of the cell is 100@xmath5 .",
    "then when the temperature is lowered ( to approximately @xmath6 ) , the solution becomes supersaturated , nucleation takes place from the seed and a growing crystal is observed .",
    "the direction of the tip growth is @xmath7100@xmath8 in the supersaturated solution and the growing dendritic crystal has fourfold symmetry .",
    "sidebranches grow behind the tip and perpendicularly to the stem , with small sub - sidebranches perpendicular to them .",
    "the image of the crystal is obtained by a microscope and a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera , whose resolution is @xmath9 pixels .",
    "the image is binarized by an image processing .",
    "the binarized image of a crystal interface is shown in fig.[crystal ] .",
    "the tip growth velocity @xmath10 is @xmath11 . in the case , sidebranches are well - developed within the shooting window , as shown in fig.[crystal ] .",
    "however since the spacing between them is smaller than the diffusion length , they are still competing each other , not growing independently .",
    "the diffusion length near the tip @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the diffusion constant of @xmath0 ( @xmath14 @xcite ) is @xmath15 , and that near a sidebranch is longer than this .",
    "therefore the growth is regarded as quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "its fractal dimension is 1.54 .",
    "the region inside the broken line is the cutoff region where the surface tension effect is neglected in our analysis .",
    "[ crystal],width=302 ]",
    "in principle it is a faithful method to the original data to evaluate the growth rate from the growth site area between two successive images , as implemented for a dla pattern@xcite .",
    "however , for a dendritic pattern , it is quite difficult to implement with satisfactory precision due to the limitation of the resolution and since the difference of the growth rates between the fast region ( around the tips of the stem and longer sidebranches ) and the slow region ( deep inside the forest of sidebranches ) is much larger than that for the dla",
    ". therefore instead , we evaluate the growth rate @xmath16 at a point @xmath17 on the interface by the gradient of the concentration field @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath18 is assumed to satisfy the laplace equation , @xmath20 , outside of the pattern .",
    "this assumption is valid if the diffusion length is larger than the characteristic length scale of the system , for example , the tip radius of the stem or the average spacing of the sidebranch generation . in this case",
    "the characteristic length scale is of the order of @xmath21 , thus the condition is satisfied .    the laplace equation for the concentration field is numerically solved by the relaxation method on a square lattice , whose spacing is set to be the pixel size . the concentration is supersaturated far away from the interface ( the saturated concentration at @xmath4 , 46 g per 100 g water ) and the gibbs - thomson boundary condition is imposed at the interface@xcite , @xmath22 ) , \\label{stiffness}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the saturation concentration(at @xmath6 , 41 g per 100 g water ) , @xmath24 the surface tension coefficient with stiffness and fourfold symmetry taken into account , @xmath25 @xcite the capillary length , and @xmath26 the local curvature at @xmath17 , respectively . the growth angle @xmath27",
    "is defined as the angle between the growth direction at @xmath17 and that of the stem .",
    "the curvature and growth angle are calculated by spline interpolation for the pixel data of the crystal interface .",
    "the range in which the growth rate takes value is vast . in the whole interface ,",
    "the ratio of the largest growth rate to the smallest is more than @xmath28 .",
    "even within the region around the tip of the stem , the ratio is more than @xmath29 .",
    "when the surface tension effect is taken into account , there may be a lattice point where the curvature radius is smaller than the lattice spacing .",
    "the curvature may vary abruptly from point to point around such a lattice point . if this situation occurs deep inside the forest of well - developed sidebranches , around their roots , a large growth rate , of the same order as that of the tips of the stem or longer sidebranches , may be generated .",
    "this is unnatural since the growth in the region is strongly suppressed . in order to appropriately take account of the surface tension effect and phenomenologically",
    "circumvent the above unnatural situation , we consider three cases below:(i ) the surface tension is completely neglected . in other words , at the interface we set @xmath30 uniformly . since the typical length scale of the system is of the same order as the lattice spacing and can be regarded as the length scale within which the surface tension is effective , this setting is reasonable .",
    "this case is labelled `` laplace '' . in this",
    "setting the growth rate distribution is the harmonic measure .",
    "( ii ) a cutoff @xmath31 is introduced . if @xmath32 , @xmath33 is replaced with @xmath31 .",
    "here we set @xmath34 times the reciprocal of the lattice spacing .",
    "this case is labelled `` cutoff(1 ) '' .",
    "( iii ) the surface tension effect is taken into account only around the tips of the stem and sidebranches and is neglected deep in the sidebranches , in the region shown in fig.[crystal ] .",
    "this case is labelled `` cutoff(2 ) '' .",
    "the dependence of the results on how to choose @xmath31 for the cutoff(1 ) case and the cutoff region for the cutoff(2 ) case is very weak as long as @xmath35 is large enough and the cutoff region is wide enough , respectively , to suppress the generation of the unnaturally large growth rate .",
    "let us consider that the interface of the dendritic crystal is covered by disjoint boxes of size @xmath36 and let @xmath37 be the growth rate in the @xmath38-th box , @xmath39 the rate @xmath37 is normalized to be a probability measure , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of boxes necessary to cover the interface completely .",
