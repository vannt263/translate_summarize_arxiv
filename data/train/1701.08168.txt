    "prompted in part by the installation and commissioning of a new camera on the wiyn 3.5-m telescope during the 2012@xmath82013 observing season , we began a campaign to obtain deep , wide - field imaging of these and other selected nearby dwarf galaxies .",

    "we obtained nine 700-second exposures of the lac  i field in @xmath24 and another nine 600-second exposures in @xmath19 with podi .",
    "the telescope was dithered between exposures in order to help eliminate gaps between the ccds and otas during the subsequent image stacking process .",

    "a prominent red giant branch ( rgb ) is the main feature observed in the lac  i cmd .",
    "the rgb coincides in location with 12  gyr old isochrones representing a range of metallicities ; see section  [ section : metallicity ] for more discussion .",
    "there is no overdensity of bright , blue ( @xmath53 ) sources in the lac  i cmd , and neither are there luminous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which would appear just above the trgb .",
    "the absence of these features suggests a predominantly old nature for lac  i s stellar population .",
    "finally , the detection of a horizontal branch / red clump , expected at @xmath54 , is hampered by the rapidly decreasing completeness at these magnitudes ( the 50% completeness level is marked with a dashed line in the leftmost panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] ) ; we are unable to draw any firm conclusions about the presence or absence of this feature .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ fig : spat ] show the spatial distribution of the rgb stars across the podi field - of - view .",
    "the stars used to create the upper two plots in this figure are those that appear within the rgb selection box in the leftmost panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the dashed line in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : spat ] is an ellipse centered on the galaxy that marks the half - light radius derived in section  [ section : structure ] , and the arrow indicates the direction toward m31 .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : spat ] shows a smoothed density map of the rgb stars , with the surface density of stars indicated by the grayscale value .",
    "it is clear from these two upper panels of figure  [ fig : spat ] that there is an obvious overdensity of sources that make up the main body of lac  i , and that the galaxy has a fairly elliptical shape .",
    "the distribution of contaminating objects in the cmd is deduced from the two rectangular field regions . as mentioned , the field regions are located beyond @xmath55 ( as derived in sec .",
    "[ section : structure ] ) , and while we can not rule out the presence of lac  i stars at these radii , their number should be negligible .",
    "examination of the field cmd in the rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] illustrates that at magnitudes fainter than @xmath56 , unresolved background galaxies will be the main source of contaminating objects . at brighter magnitudes ,",
    "galactic foreground star sequences are readily apparent .",
    "for all subsequent analysis in this paper , we take into account the background / foreground contamination based on the combined cmd of the two field regions .",
    "the location of the rgb selection box marked in the cmd was chosen so that it begins at the location of the trgb , encompasses the full width of the rgb , and cuts off at a faint magnitude limit of @xmath57 to avoid the region of the cmd with both rapidly increasing incompleteness and photometric uncertainties , as well as an increasing number of background galaxy contaminants .",

    "the distance to lac  i is derived by applying the trgb method @xcite to our data . to accomplish this",
    "we adopt the method introduced by @xcite , modified following the approach of @xcite .",
    "first , a model luminosity function is convolved with completeness , uncertainty and bias as derived from our artificial star tests ; then , we fitted this model function to lac  i s luminosity function ( see figure  [ fig : trgb ] ) , which is derived for rgb stars within @xmath58 and with a color cut of @xmath52 in order to consider metal - poor stars and minimize contamination from foreground galactic stars .",
    "this procedure determines the observed magnitude at which the luminosity function has a sharp transition , which is expected for old and metal - poor rgb populations at the end of this evolutionary phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the absolute magnitude for this transition is constant , and it is computed to be @xmath59 mag for the sdss @xmath19-band @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty is computed with a monte carlo ( mc ) approach , by varying the magnitude of the observed stars within the photometric uncertainties and re - fitting the model luminosity function . from this analysis",
    "we derive a best - fit trgb luminosity of @xmath60 mag , which translates to a distance modulus of @xmath2 mag , fully consistent with the @xmath61 mag estimate given in the @xcite discovery paper . the physical distance to lac",
    "i is thus @xmath62  kpc , which is consistent with m31 s distance .",
    "combining this with the distance to m31 and the angular distance on the sky between the two galaxies yields a 3d distance for lac  i of @xmath63  kpc from m31 .",
    "we fitted an exponential profile distribution to the surface density profile of lac  i , utilizing the maximum likelihood technique described by @xcite , as implemented by @xcite .",
    "while real satellites often have a complexity that can not be encapsulated by parameterized models such as the exponential profile , such profiles are useful for quantifying the galaxies basic structural properties and for direct comparison with other results .",
    "the stars selected for the structural analysis are drawn from the rgb selection box seen in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , which includes a limiting magnitude of @xmath64 mag so as to avoid any adverse effects from crowding at faint magnitudes .",
    "the free parameters for our exponential profile model are : the central position ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath5 , which is defined as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the scale length along the minor axis and @xmath69 is the scale length along the major axis ) , position angle ( pa ; @xmath70 ) , half - light radius ( @xmath4 ) and background surface density ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "uncertainties on each parameter were calculated via 1000 bootstrap resamples of the data , from which 68% confidence limits were derived .",
    "the resulting structural parameters for lac  i are presented in table  [ tab : parms ] , along with the other properties we measure for the galaxy .",
    "the probability distribution functions derived from the maximum likelihood analysis are shown in figure  [ fig : pdf ] .",
    "our structural parameters are in agreement with the discovery data of @xcite to within the uncertainties , although our derived half - light radius is smaller and slightly more than 1-@xmath72 discrepant . the structural parameters presented here",
    "should not be biased given the depth of the data , the stellar density contrast compared to the background , and the field of view of the podi data ; our data set meets all of the criteria determined by @xcite for deriving accurate structural parameters using our maximum likelihood technique .",
    "we show a one - dimensional representation of our best - fitting stellar profile in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spat ] . while the binned data points are not used to fit stellar profiles  as the maximum likelihood technique uses the two dimensional unbinned distribution of stars ",
    "the agreement between the best - fitting model stellar profile and the data points is excellent , with only minor deviations from an exponential profile .    to measure the total magnitude of lac i , we first sum the flux within one half - light radius using the rgb stars within the cmd selection box shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] . from this ,",
    "we subtract off the flux from foreground and background sources using the field regions marked in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : spat ] and rescaling to match the area used for lac i. we then multiply the remaining flux by a factor of two to account for the flux outside of lac i s half light radius .",
    "we correct for stars below our detection limit by using several metal poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.5 to @xmath82.0 ) and old ( 10 - 13 gyr ) parsec luminosity functions ( bressan et al . 2012 ) . from this , we measure @xmath73 @xmath7 @xmath811.3@xmath30.2 mag and @xmath74 @xmath7",
    "@xmath812.0@xmath30.2 mag , and convert this to @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath811.4@xmath30.3 mag using the filter transformation of veljanoski et al .",
    "our total magnitude is consistent within the uncertainties with the value presented in the @xcite discovery paper ( @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath811.7@xmath30.7 mag ) , although our uncertainty is a factor of two smaller .",
    "the central surface brightness of lac  i is calculated using the total magnitude and the best - fitting exponential profile described earlier , and is @xmath9 @xmath7 24.8@xmath30.3 mag / arcsec@xmath75 . our measured @xmath9 value is a full magnitude brighter than the corresponding value from @xcite ( @xmath9 @xmath7 25.8@xmath30.8 mag / arcsec@xmath75 ) , although the numbers are in agreement to within the uncertainties .",
    "as is the case with the total magnitude , the uncertainty on our central surface brightness measurement is substantially reduced compared to the previous measurement .",
    "( note that this increase in surface brightness is not unexpected , since our derived half - light radius is smaller . ) the derived magnitudes and surface brightness values are included in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "we investigated the neutral gas content of lac  i by searching for hi emission along the line - of - sight to the galaxy in publicly - available effelsberg bonn hi survey data ( ebhis ; winkel et al .",
    "2016 ) , smoothed to a spectral resolution of 15 km  s@xmath21 .",
    "we find no hi emission in the smoothed spectrum at the systemic velocity for lac  i reported by @xcite , and compute a 5-@xmath72 , single - channel upper limit on the hi mass within 6@xmath28 ( 1.85  @xmath4 ) of @xmath76 @xmath7 1.9 @xmath77 10@xmath78 .",
    "this implies @xmath11 @xmath12 0.06 @xmath13/@xmath14 for lac  i ( see [ tab : parms ] ) , and therefore that this galaxy is gas - poor like the other dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the milky way and m31 @xcite .",
    "we derive photometric metallicities for each individual rgb star that is located within our rgb selection box ( marked in fig . [",
    "fig : cmd ] ) and also has @xmath79 mag .",
    "applying this additional faint - magnitude cut reduces contamination significantly and keeps the photometric uncertainties below 0.1  mag in magnitude and 0.2  mag in color , to ensure that we are using the best - quality photometric data to yield metallicity information .",
    "photometric metallicities are obtained by linearly interpolating among stellar isochrones with a fixed aged of 12  gyr and varying metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath80 to @xmath81 ; @xcite ) . under the assumption that the rgb width is mainly driven by metallicity rather than age , the color of a rgb star will correspond to an isochrone with a given metallicity ( see fig .",

    "this type of approach provides robust results in terms of _ relative _ quantities such as the derivation of radial metallicity trends @xcite .",

    "the percentage of contaminants in the three radial bins is @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , respectively .",

    "the value was rounded to the nearest integer , and then that number of stars was randomly removed from the appropriate data file .",

    "the fixed - age approximation inherent to the photometric metallicity derivation method can only partly explain this discrepancy . for the discrepancy with the @xcite data set to be alleviated",
    ", their spectroscopic sample would need to have missed the majority of the metal - rich subsample highlighted by our mdfs .",
    "a close inspection of our mdfs suggests that there could be two metallicity peaks , at [ fe / h]@xmath101 and [ fe / h]@xmath102 respectively , which are most pronounced in the innermost radial bin ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdf ] ) .",
    "the distinction fades off in the middle bin , while the last adopted bin contains few stars due to the rapidly decreasing stellar density beyond @xmath103 , thus any possible trend gets lost in the noise .",
    "we stress that the radial mdfs have a comparable shape when derived under the assumption of a fixed 8  gyr age .",
    "we carried out the following steps to investigate whether the apparent multiple peaks in the mdfs might actually be statistically significant . the contamination - corrected mdf data ( i.e. , the individual photometric metallicity values of the stars in the three radial regions shown in figure  [ fig : mdf ] , corrected for contamination ) were evaluated with a series of statistical tests to assess the likelihood that a mixture of one , two , or three gaussian distributions can produce the observed values .",
    "we used a parametric bootstrap anderson - darling ( a - d ) test @xcite to independently test each gaussian mixture as a potential fit to the mdfs .",
    "first , a set of one to three gaussian functions was fitted to the input data , and best - fitting means , dispersions , and mixing proportions for each gaussian were returned .",
    "the original data were evaluated against the candidate mixture model using the a - d test .",
    "next , 1000 synthetic data sets with the same parameters as the best - fitting mixture model were produced and evaluated with the a - d test .",
    "the a - d score derived from the observed data was then compared to the distribution of bootstrapped a - d scores .",
    "this testing procedure indicated with high confidence that the observed mdfs for all three radial regions are not likely to be drawn from a unimodal or bimodal gaussian distribution .",
    "the data in the outermost radial region ( @xmath104 ) is also not likely to be drawn from a trimodal gaussian distribution .",
    "the tests also indicated , however , that there is a high probability that the mdf data for the inner two radial regions ( @xmath105 and @xmath88 ) _ is _ drawn from a mixture of three gaussian distributions .",
    "the peak values ( and dispersions ) of the best - fitting gaussian functions are [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath81.3 ( 0.1 ) , @xmath81.8 ( 0.3 ) , and @xmath82.4 ( 0.1 ) and mixing fractions of 31% , 63% , and 6% , respectively for the stars inside the half - light radius @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding values for stars with radii between @xmath4 and 2  @xmath4 are [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath81.4 ( 0.1 ) , @xmath81.8 ( 0.2 ) , and @xmath82.4 ( 0.1 ) and mixing fractions of 25% , 71% , and 5% , respectively .",
    "we performed additional analysis steps to determine whether the parametric bootstrap a - d test was identifying multi - modality simply because of the noise in the data or biases introduced during the conversion from photometric measurements to metallicities .",
    "we generated a synthetic mdf by populating an isochrone to produce a 12-gyr population with [ fe / h]@xmath1@xmath81.7 . we convolved this catalog with the photometric errors from our data set to obtain an `` observed '' cmd .",
    "we derived metallicities for rgb stars within the upper @xmath12  magnitudes of the synthetic rgb , just as was done for the real data .",
    "we then carried out the bootstrap testing procedure on the synthetic [ fe / h ] values and found that the best - fitting unimodal , bimodal , and trimodal gaussian distributions were all unlikely to reproduce the particular distribution of the test data set at a high confidence level ( 99.999% , 98.3% , and 99.5% for the unimodal , bimodal , and trimodal distributions respectively ) . since the bootstrap testing rejected not only the bimodal and trimodal mixture models but also the single - metallicity model , we can only infer from this that the observed trimodality that is implied by the a - d testing on the real data may not be genuine either .",
    "our overall conclusion based on this analysis is that although it is possible that a dwarf galaxy with the properties of lac  i could indeed have multiple stellar populations , our photometric metallicities are unable to unambiguously demonstrate their presence or absence .",
    "the spectroscopic metallicity value reported by @xcite separates lac  i from the bulk of local group dwarfs on a luminosity - metallicity plot ( fig . 4 in their paper , which shows the positions of m31 satellite dwarf galaxies on the luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation derived by @xcite from nearby dwarfs ) , i.e.",
    ", it is too metal - poor for its luminosity .",
    "we can take our updated absolute magnitude measurement , @xmath106 , and our median photometric metallicity estimate of [ fe / h ] @xmath1@xmath81.68 ( from all of the stars in the contamination - corrected mdfs ) , and compare these values to the @xcite l - z relation ( their equation 3 ) . assuming this relation , the predicted [ fe / h ] value for lac  i given its luminosity is @xmath81.54 .",
    "the rms scatter of the kirby et al .",
    "relation is 0.16 dex , so our photometric metallicity value is , interestingly , more in line with the expected value .",
    "lastly , we also looked for the presence of a metallicity gradient in lac  i. we used the photometrically - derived metallicities for stars within one and two @xmath4 .",
    "we did not correct for contamination for this experiment because the field - star contamination would be only 2% within @xmath4 and 8% within 2  @xmath4 .",
    "the measured metallicity gradient in our data is @xmath107[fe / h]@xmath108 and @xmath109 dex per @xmath4 , respectively , which is consistent with a flat metallicity profile .",
    "the lack of a gradient has also been observed in some dwarf galaxies of similar luminosity beyond the local group ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may suggest that the galaxies are not massive enough to favor a second episode of star formation and thus a distinct and more metal - rich population in their central regions .",
    "in this paper we presented results from deep , wide - field wiyn podi @xmath0 imaging of the m31 dwarf satellite galaxy lac  i ( and  xxxi ) , acquired in order to investigate the galaxy s structure , stellar populations , and metallicity .",
    "the cmd of this galaxy is dominated by an old ( @xmath112 gyr ) stellar population and no intermediate - age stars ( agb stars ) are apparent in our data .",
    "we trace the rgb stars in the lac  i images to a radius of @xmath110  arcmin ( @xmath12.25  kpc ) from the galaxy center and use them to derive a distance to the galaxy as well as its structural properties .",
    "our measured trgb distance of 773@xmath340  kpc agrees with the pan - starrs discovery paper distance @xcite . our derived 3d distance for lac  i",
    "to m31 is 264@xmath36  kpc and we confirm the finding by @xcite that lac  i is in the far western outskirts of the andromeda galaxy halo .    despite its relatively late discovery and distant location from its host galaxy , lac",
    "i seems in other ways to be a fairly typical local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "our derived half - light radius @xmath4 and associated uncertainty for the galaxy , 728@xmath347  pc , are smaller than the pan - starrs1-measured value ( 912@xmath110 pc ) , although they agree within the uncertainties .",
    "@xcite used the measured @xmath23-band absolute magnitudes and half - light radii of dsph satellites of the galaxy and m31 and found that they follow a well - defined size - luminosity relation and that the relations for each galaxy ( the milky way and m31 ) are statistically the same .",
    "given its measured @xmath6 of @xmath811.4 from our podi data , the derived half - light radius of lac  i is right in line with the value predicted by the @xcite relation for andromeda dsph galaxies , 685@xmath111  pc .",
    "our measured ellipticity value , @xmath5 @xmath7 0.44@xmath30.03 is almost identical to the pan - starrs1 value , but with a formal uncertainty that is a factor of two smaller .",
    "this ellipticity is within the usual range for dsph satellites of andromeda ; for the dsph galaxies in the m31 sub - group , the range of ellipticities is 0.13@xmath80.56 , with a mean @xmath5 of 0.31 and a dispersion of 0.12 @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that this galaxy is gas - poor , with an upper limit on the hi gas to @xmath112 ratio that is comparable to the most sensitive limits for dsph galaxies orbiting the milky way @xcite .    our investigation of the mdf of lac  i  which we derived from photometry of the rgb stars with @xmath31 @xmath12 23 mag",
    " indicates that this galaxy is metal - poor , with a median [ fe / h ] of @xmath81.68@xmath30.03 for stars within 2  @xmath4 , but a broad range of stellar metallicities , from [ fe / h]@xmath1 @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "although the appearance of the mdfs in certain radial regions seems to suggest the presence of multiple metallicity peaks , statistical testing performed on the distributions indicates that the multi - modality may not be real .",
    "we find no evidence for a radial gradient in our photometric metallicities .",
    "lastly , we note that the median metallicity derived from our rgb star photometry is higher than the median metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath115@xmath30.1 measured by @xcite from their spectroscopic observations of 126 bright ( @xmath116 @xmath11720.5 ) rgb stars in lac  i , and the somewhat higher metallicity we measure moves lac  i closer to the expected @xmath118 relation for dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the causes of the differences in the photometric versus spectroscopic metallicities are not obvious and seem to warrant further investigation .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the wiyn observatory and kitt peak national observatory for their assistance with using wiyn and the podi camera to obtain the data used for this study .",
