    "when a domain @xmath0 is partitioned into elements , a function in a sobolev space like @xmath1 or @xmath2 has continuity constraints across element interfaces , e.g , the former has tangential continuity , while the latter has continuity of its normal component . if these continuity constraints are removed from the space , then we obtain `` broken '' sobolev spaces . discontinuous petrov galerkin ( dpg ) methods introduced in  @xcite used spaces of such discontinuous functions in broken sobolev spaces to localize certain computations .",
    "the studies in this paper begin by clarifying this process of breaking sobolev spaces .",
    "this process , sometimes called hybridization , has been well studied within a discrete setting .",
    "for instance , the hybridized raviart - thomas method  @xcite is obtained by discretizing a variational formulation and then removing the continuity constraints of the discrete space , i.e. , by discretizing first and then hybridizing .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we identify methods obtained by hybridizing first and then discretizing , a setting more natural for dpg methods .",
    "we then take this idea further by connecting the stability of formulations with broken spaces and unbroken spaces , leading to the first convergence proof of a dpg method for maxwell equations .",
    "the next section ( section  [ sec : break ] ) is devoted to a study of the interface spaces that arise when breaking sobolev spaces .",
    "these infinite - dimensional interface spaces can be used to connect the broken and the unbroken spaces .",
    "the main result of section  [ sec : break ] , contained in theorem  [ thm : duality ] , makes this connection precise and provides an elementary characterization ( by duality ) of the natural norms on these interface spaces .",
    "this theorem can be viewed as a generalization of a similar result in  @xcite .",
    "having discussed breaking spaces , we proceed to break variational formulations in section  [ sec : break - forms ] .",
    "the motivation for the theory in that section is that some variational formulations set in broken spaces have another closely related variational formulation set in their unbroken counterpart .",
    "this is the case with all the formulations on which the dpg method is based .",
    "the main observation of section  [ sec : break - forms ] is a simple result ( theorem  [ thm : hybrid ] ) which in its abstract form seems to be already known in other studies  @xcite . in the dpg context",
    ", it provides sufficient conditions under which _ stability of broken forms follow from stability of their unbroken relatives_. as a consequence of this observation , we are able to simplify many previous analyses of dpg methods .",
    "the content of sections  [ sec : break ] and  [ sec : break - forms ] can be understood without reference to the dpg method .    a quick introduction to the dpg method",
    "is given in section  [ sec : dpg ] , where known conditions needed for _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ error analysis are also presented .",
    "one of the conditions is the existence of a fortin operator . anticipating the needs of the maxwell application , we then present , in section  [ sec : fortin ] , a sequence of fortin operators for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , all on a single tetrahedral mesh element  @xmath5 .",
    "they are constructed to satisfy certain moment conditions required for analysis of dpg methods .",
    "they fit into a commuting diagram that helps us prove the required norm estimates ( see theorem  [ thm : fortin ] ) .",
    "the time - harmonic maxwell equations within a cavity are considered afterward in section  [ sec : maxwell ] .",
    "focusing first on a simple dpg method for maxwell equation , called the primal dpg method , we provide a complete analysis using the tools developed in the previous section .",
    "to understand one of the novelties here , recall that the wellposedness of the maxwell equations is guaranteed as soon as the excitation frequency of the harmonic wave is different from a cavity resonance .",
    "however , this wellposedness is not directly inherited by most standard discretizations , which are often known to be stable solely in an asymptotic regime  @xcite . the discrete spaces used must be sufficiently fine before one can even guarantee solvability of the discrete system , not to mention error guarantees . furthermore",
    ", the analysis of the standard finite element method does not clarify how fine the mesh needs to be to ensure that the stable regime is reached .",
    "in contrast , the dpg schemes , having inherited their stability from the exact equations , are stable no matter how coarse the mesh is .",
    "this advantage is striking when attempting robust adaptive meshing strategies .",
    "another focus of section  [ sec : maxwell ] is the understanding of a proliferation of formulations for the maxwell boundary value problem .",
    "one may decide to treat individual equations of the maxwell system differently , e.g. , one equation may be imposed strongly , while another may be imposed weakly via integration by parts .",
    "mixed methods make a particular choice , while primal methods make a different choice . we will show ( see theorem  [ thm : maxwellcycles ] ) that the stability of one formulation implies the stability of five others .",
    "the proof is an interesting application of the closed range theorem .",
    "however , when the dpg methodology is applied to discretize these formulations , the numerical results reported in section  [ sec : numer ] , show that the various methods do exhibit differences .",
    "this is because the functional settings are different for different formulations , i.e. , convergence to the solution occurs in different norms .",
    "section  [ sec : numer ] also provides results from numerical investigations on issues where the theory is currently silent .",
    "in this section , we discuss precisely what we mean by breaking sobolev spaces using a mesh",
    ". we will define _ broken spaces _ and _ interface spaces _ and prove a duality result that clarifies the interplay between these spaces .",
    "we work with infinite - dimensional ( but mesh - dependent ) spaces on an open bounded domain @xmath6 with lipschitz boundary .",
    "the mesh , denoted by @xmath7 , is a disjoint partitioning of @xmath0 into open elements @xmath5 such that the union of their closures is the closure of @xmath8 the collection of element boundaries @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that each element boundary @xmath9 is lipschitz .",
    "the shape of the elements is otherwise arbitrary for now .",
    "we focus on the most commonly occurring first order sobolev spaces of real or complex - valued functions , namely @xmath12 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 .",
    "their _ broken _ versions are defined , respectively , by @xmath13 as these broken spaces contain functions with no continuity requirements at element interfaces , their discretization is easier than that of globally conforming spaces .    to recover the original sobolev spaces from these broken spaces , we need traces and interface variables .",
    "first , let us consider these traces on each element @xmath5 in @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 here and throughout @xmath16 denotes the unit outward normal on @xmath9 and is often simply written as @xmath17 .",
    "both @xmath16 and these traces are well defined almost everywhere on @xmath9 , thanks to our assumption that @xmath9 is lipschitz .",
    "the operators @xmath18 @xmath19 , and @xmath20 perform the above trace operation element by element on each of the broken spaces we defined previously , thus giving rise to linear maps @xmath21 it is well known that these maps are continuous and surjective ( for the standard definitions of the above codomain sobolev spaces , see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "an element of @xmath22 is expressed using notations like @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( even when @xmath25 itself has not been assigned any separate meaning ) that are evocative of their dependence on the interface normals .",
    "similarly , the elements of the other trace map codomains are expressed using notations like @xmath26    next , we need spaces of _ interface _ functions .",
    "we use the above trace operators to define them , after cautiously noting two issues that can arise on an interface piece @xmath27 shared by two mesh elements @xmath28 in @xmath14 .",
    "first , functions in the range of @xmath29 when restricted to @xmath30 is generally multivalued , and we would like our interface functions to be single valued in some sense .",
    "second , the range of the remaining trace operators consists of functionals whose restrictions to @xmath31 are in general undefined .",
    "the following definitions circumvent these issues .",
    "@xmath32 if @xmath14 consists of a single element , then @xmath33 equals @xmath34 , but in general @xmath35 ( and similar remarks apply for the other spaces ) .",
    "we norm each of the above interface spaces by these quotient norms :    [ eq : norms ] @xmath36    these are indeed quotient norms because the infimums are over cosets generated by kernels of the trace maps .",
    "e.g. , if @xmath37 is any function in @xmath12 such that @xmath38 , then the set where the minimization is carried out in  , namely @xmath39 equals the coset @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "note that every element of this coset is an extension of @xmath42 .",
    "for this reason , such norms are also known as the `` minimum energy extension '' norms . for an alternate way to characterize the interface spaces ,",
    "see  @xcite .    the quotient norm in   appeared in the literature as early as  @xcite .",
    "the word `` hybrid '' that appears in their title was used to refer to situations where , to quote  @xcite , `` the constraint of interelement continuity has been removed at the expense of introducing a lagrange multiplier . ''",
    "the quote also summarizes the discussion of this section well .",
    "the above definitions of our four interface spaces are thus generalizations of a definition in  @xcite and each can be interpreted as an appropriate space of lagrange multipliers .",
    "we now show by elementary arguments that the quotient norms on the two pairs of trace spaces @xmath43 are dual to each other .",
    "the duality pairing in any hilbert space @xmath44 , namely the action of a linear or conjugate linear ( antilinear ) functional @xmath45 on @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath47 and we omit the subscript in this notation when no confusion can arise .",
    "we also adopt the convention that when taking supremum over vector spaces ( such as in the next result ) the zero element is omitted tacitly .",
    "[ lem : duality ] the following identities hold for any @xmath48 in @xmath49 and any @xmath42 in @xmath50    [ eq : sup ] @xmath51 the next two identities hold for any @xmath52 in @xmath53 and any @xmath54 in @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56    the first identity is proved using an equivalence between a dirichlet and a neumann problem .",
    "the dirichlet problem is the problem of finding @xmath57 , given @xmath58 , such that @xmath59 -{\\mathop{\\mathrm{grad}}}(\\text{div } \\sigma ) + \\sigma = 0 , & \\quad\\text{in } k. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the neumann problem finds @xmath60 satisfying @xmath61 - \\text{div } ( { \\mathop{\\mathrm{grad}}}w ) + w = 0 , & \\quad\\text{in } k. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] it is immediate that problems   and   are equivalent in the sense that @xmath37 solves   if and only if @xmath62 solves   and moreover @xmath63 .",
    "it is also obvious from the calculus of variations that among all @xmath64-extensions of @xmath24 , the solution of   has the minimal @xmath64 norm ( i.e. , @xmath65 is the `` minimum energy extension '' referred to earlier ) , so @xmath66 where we used the variational form of   in the last step .",
    "( here and throughout , we use @xmath67 to denote the inner product in @xmath68 or its cartesian products . )",
    "this proves the first equality of  .",
    "next , analogous to   and  , we set up another pair of dirichlet and neumann problems .",
    "the first problem is to find @xmath69 in @xmath70 , given any @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 the second is to find @xmath73 in @xmath64 such that @xmath74 the solution @xmath69 of   has the minimal @xmath70 norm among all extensions of @xmath42 into @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath76 so taking the supremum over all @xmath42 in @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78 since the reverse inequality is obvious from the definition of the quotient norm in the denominator , we have established the second identity of  . to prove  , we begin , as above ,",
    "by observing that @xmath73 is the solution to the neumann problem   if and only if @xmath79 solves the dirichlet problem  .",

    "hence @xmath81 where we have used the variational form of   in the last step .",
    "the proof of   can now be completed as before .",
    "we follow exactly the same reasoning for the @xmath82 case , summarized as follows : on one hand , the norm of an interface function equals the norm of a minimum energy extension , while on the other hand , it equals the norm of the inverse of a riesz map applied to a functional generated by the interface function .",
    "the minimum energy extension that yields the interface norm @xmath83 is now the solution of the dirichlet problem of finding @xmath84 satisfying @xmath85 while the inverse of the riesz map applied to the functional generated by @xmath86 is obtained by solving the neumann problem @xmath87 again , the two problems are equivalent in the sense that @xmath30 solves   if and only if @xmath88 solves  .",
    "moreover , @xmath89 . hence @xmath90 the proof of   follows from this .",
    "the proof of   is similar and is left to the reader .",
    "let us return to the product spaces like @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
