    "historically sasakian structures grew out of research in contact manifolds . in 1960 , sasaki  @xcite introduced a geometric structure related to an almost contact structure .",
    "this geometry became known as sasakian geometry and has been studied extensively ever since . in the 1960 s ,",
    "the sasakian structure was studied extensively as an odd dimensional analogue of khler spaces  @xcite .    afterwards , by developing the khler structure to quaternionic spaces the concept of quaternionic khler and hyperkhler manifolds",
    "were introduced .",
    "hyperkhler manifolds are special class of khler manifolds .",
    "they can be thought of as quaternionic analogues of khler manifolds while a quaternionic khler manifold needs not to be a khler one in general . in recent years",
    "quaternionic khler and hyperkhler manifolds have received a great deal of attention .",
    "they appear and play an important role in many different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics  @xcite .",
    "the 3-sasakian manifolds , which have a close relation to both hyperkhler and quaternionic khler manifolds , first appeared in a paper by kuo in  @xcite . in 1970 three more papers  @xcite were published in the japanese literature discussing sasakian 3-structures . later on , in 1973 ishihara  @xcite had shown that if the distribution formed by the three killing vector fields which define the 3-sasakian structure is regular then the space of leaves is a quaternionic khler manifold .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is a 3-sasakian manifold and @xmath4 denotes the transverse distribution to the riemannian foliation @xmath5 with respect to the metric @xmath6 in the tangent bundle @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the geometric properties of the distribution @xmath4 as well as the tangent bundle of a manifold such as curvature tensor , sectional curvature and ricci tensor .",
    "moreover , we investigate the close relation of @xmath1-sectional curvatures of @xmath7 and holomorphic sectional curvatures of @xmath4",
    ". we can refer to  @xcite as an analogue work on sasakian manifolds .",
    "aiming at our purpose , we organized this paper as follows . in section 2 , we present some basic notations and definitions which are needed in the following sections . in section 3 , the new linear connection @xmath0 is introduced in the terms of levi - civita connection .",
    "we show that it is a metric connection and completely determined by @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 structures are parallel with respect to the new connection @xmath0 on @xmath4 . in section 4",
    ", we present the hyperkhler properties of the distribution @xmath4 and call it the hyperkhler contact distribution . in this section , the curvature and ricci tensor of hyperkhler contact distribution @xmath4 is defined with respect to the metric connection @xmath0 . finally , in this section",
