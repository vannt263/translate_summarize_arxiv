    "non - resonant photoexcitation of an electron - hole pair in the barrier [ fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) ] often leads to capture by wetting - layer ( wl ) quasi - continua .",
    "this process consists of carrier thermalization within the gaas barrier and subsequent capture by the wl .",

    "while in ( in , ga)as / gaas self - assembled dots the changes with size in the joint density of states prevails , in cdse colloidal dots the changes of the coulomb integrals dictates the gap dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "we have discussed several dynamical processes that photoexcited electrons and holes undergo in ( in , ga)as / gaas self - assembled quantum dots , and calculated the inter - shell @xmath0-to-@xmath1 electron decay lifetime in ( in , ga)as / gaas self - assembled dot due to auger electron - hole scattering .",
    "when only an electron ( or only a hole ) is present due to doping and this sole carrier is excited by a photon , its decay must involve a non - auger mechanism ( perhaps polaron decay ) .",
    "but when both an electron and hole are present we show that this auger cooling takes place within picoseconds , which makes it an efficient inter - shell relaxation process compared to radiative recombination ( @xmath208 ) .",

    "the values we find for @xmath209 compare well with recent data in the presence of photoexcited holes .",
    "this finding complemented with our review of the data in the literature allows us to conclude that in the presence of a photoexcited hole there is no need to invoke the alternative polaron - decay mechanism for inter - shell electron relaxation",
    ". this conclusion could be tested in ( in , ga)as / gaas dots by measuring the rate of hole thermalization versus the electron excess energy , or by measuring the electron relaxation rate after modifying the surface of the dot so as to cause hole trapping .",
    "finally , a consistent picture of electron relaxation within quantum dots appears to demand two relaxation mechanisms : electron - hole auger scattering and polaron decay .",
