    "in the pseudogap phase of high - temperature ( high - t@xmath5 ) superconductors , the temperature dependence of the c - axis resistivity @xmath6 is semiconductor - like ( @xmath7 ) , in contrast to the in - plane resistivity @xmath8 whose temperature dependence is metal - like ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this dramatic difference between @xmath6 and @xmath8 is not what one might expect within the conventional fermi liquid theory .",
    "it has stimulated vast theoretical and experimental investigations on the interlayer dynamics of high - t@xmath5 cuprates .",
    "however , the existing theoretical models based on the notion of dynamic confinement @xcite or incoherent interlayer hopping @xcite could not give a natural and unified explanation for experimental data .",
    "in high - t@xmath5 cuprates , the c - axis hopping integral is highly anisotropic and depends strongly on the in - plane momenta .",
    "@xcite based on electron structure calculations @xcite and symmetry analysis , @xcite it was shown that the c - axis hopping integral in high - t@xmath5 cuprates with tetragonal symmetry is given by @xmath10 this peculiar in - plane momentum dependence of @xmath11 results from the hybridization between the bonding o 2p orbitals and cu 4s or @xmath12 orbitals in each cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "it was confirmed by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements .",
    "@xcite @xmath13 vanishes along the two diagonals of the brillouin zone .",
    "these are also the directions where the nodes of the @xmath14 ( d)-wave superconducting gap or the normal state pseudogap ( it has also the d - wave symmetry @xcite ) are located .",
    "thus the quasiparticle excitations around the gap nodes have almost no contributions to the c - axis hopping .",
    "this indicates that the c - axis dynamics is governed by the quasiparticle excitations around the antinodal points .",
    "the interplay between @xmath11 and the d - wave energy gap can affect strongly the c - axis dynamics of electrons . in the superconducting state",
    ", it leads to , for example , a t@xmath15 temperature dependent c - axis superfluid density in low temperatures , @xcite in contrast to the linear - t behavior of the in - plane superfluid density . in a pseudogap normal state , since the contribution from the quasiparticle excitations around the nodal points is suppressed by the integral ( 1 ) , the interlayer transport would behave as in a gapped system and @xmath6 should show a thermally activated behavior . on the contrary , the in - plane dynamics is governed by low - lying excitations around the gap nodes in low temperatures .",
    "thus @xmath8 would behave similarly as in a gapless system .",
    "this explains naturally why the temperature dependence of @xmath16 is semiconductor - like while @xmath8 is metal - like in the pseudogap phase .",
    "in making this argument , we have implicitly assumed that the c - axis hopping is predominantly coherent . @xcite",
    "we believe this assumption is correct , at least in the limit of weak impurity scattering .",
    "it is supported by the observation of the bilayer splitting of the bonding and antibonding bands in the arpes spectra , @xcite the intrinsic t@xmath15 temperature dependence of the c - axis superfluid density , as well as the recent angular - dependent magnetoresistance measurement .",
    "@xcite    the c - axis dynamics could be also affected by phonon or other collective excitations . along the nodal directions ,",
    "a dispersion kink has been observed in the spectral function of electrons by the arpes in both superconducting @xcite and normal states .",
    "@xcite this kink is believed to result from the electron - phonon coupling . along the antinodal direction , a stronger kink feature was observed in the single - electron spectrum below t@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite this stronger kink seems to be correlated with the peak - dip - hump lineshape as observed in the arpes spectra at antinodal points .",
    "@xcite it is likely to be due to the coupling of electrons with a magnetic resonance mode .",
    "it could also be explained by the coupling of electrons with a b@xmath17-phonon mode .",
    "@xcite however , this dispersion kink together with the peak - dip - hump structure in the arpes spectra disappears above t@xmath5 .",
    "it suggests that the coupling between electrons and phonons or magnetic resonance modes is strong around the gap nodes but very weak along the antinodal directions in the normal state .",
    "thus we believe that the coupling between electrons and phonons or magnetic resonance modes should have very weak or negligible effect on c - axis transport properties in the normal state .",
    "the above discussion indicates that in the normal state the pseudogap is the only energy scale governing the c - axis hopping around the antinodal regions .",
    "if the c - axis hopping is predominately coherent , this would suggest that the temperature dependence of @xmath6 should satisfy a single - parameter scaling law @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a scaling function , @xmath20 is a doping - dependent coefficient , and @xmath21 is the maximal value of the pseudogap .",
    "the detailed form of @xmath19 is unknown .",
    "however , as will be shown below , an approximate but accurate expression for @xmath19 can be obtained by simple theoretical analysis .",
    "@xmath6 is determined by the interlayer hopping integral and the scattering mechanism .",
    "it can be obtained by evaluating the current - current correlation function in the linear response theory . in the highly anisotropic cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the c - axis hopping can be considered as perturbation . in this case , the c - axis conductivity @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the c - axis velocity of electrons and @xmath25 is the fermi function .",
    "@xmath26 is the spectral function of pseudogapped electrons . at present ,",
    "an accurate microscopic description of @xmath26 is not available since the mechanism of pseudogap is still unclear .",
    "however , phenomenologically one can assume @xmath26 to have the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy dispersion of pseudogapped electrons , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the usual normal state energy measured from the fermi level .",
    "@xmath31 is the linewidth , proportional to the scattering rate . in the normal state above the pseudogap phase ,",
    "@xmath8 varies linearly with t. it suggests that @xmath31 scales linearly with t. this linear t dependent @xmath31 is a basic assumption made in the marginal fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "it gives a natural account of many experimental results , including the linear in - plane resistivity .",
    "here we will also adopt this assumption .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ ak ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sigma0 ] ) , it can be shown that to the leading order approximation in @xmath31 , @xmath22 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an effective measure of the c - axis tunneling probability of electrons @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the system volume .",
    "@xmath33 reduces to the density of states @xmath36 of d - wave gapped electrons if @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) is set to 1 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares the energy dependence of @xmath33 with @xmath36 .    -0.5",
    "cm    it shows clearly that the c - axis hopping of low - energy quasiparticles is strongly suppressed by @xmath11 and the low energy @xmath33 is vanishingly small compared with that at @xmath37 .",
    "thus if the temperature considered is not too low compared with @xmath21 , the contribution of low energy electrons to the c - axis hopping can be ignored .",
    "this has motivated us to replace approximately @xmath33 by a step function , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an average value of @xmath33 at @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath21 should be slightly smaller than the true maximum pseudogap since the contribution from the states with @xmath41 should be effectively included in the above approximation .",
    "apparently this is a crude approximation , but it allows us to get an analytical expression for @xmath22 . by substituting ( [ nc - approx ] ) into ( [ sigma1 ] ) , we find that @xmath6 is approximately given by @xmath42 in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "we have tested this formula with numerical calculations without taking the step - function approximation for @xmath33 .",
    "we find that eq .",
    "( [ rhoc ] ) does fit the numerical curves very well in the above limit .",
    "though this formula is derived within a limited temperature regime , it captures qualitatively the main features of @xmath6 in the whole temperature range in the normal state . in the low temperature limit @xmath44 , eq .",
    "( [ rhoc ] ) is thermally activated . in the high temperature limit @xmath45",
    ", @xmath6 varies linearly with t. both agree with the experimental observations .",
    "to test our single - parameter scaling conjecture , we have analyzed the experimental data of @xmath6 published for bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212 ) by watanabe et al .",

    "@xcite for clarity .",
    "the experimental data of bi2212 by the same group @xcite can be also scaled onto the same curve .",
    "the experimental data of bi2212 published by other two groups @xcite are showed in fig .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 for bi2212 , bi2223 , and y123 at different doping levels are given in table i - v .",
    "the doping - dependence of @xmath21 and comparison with the arpes data will be discussed later .    -0.5 cm    the measurement data deviate slightly from the scaling curve near t@xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the superconducting fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this deviation is not unexpected since in this case the single - parameter scaling law ( 2 ) should be modified to include the contributions from the superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the above analysis shows that the scaling behavior of @xmath6 is universal and the scaling function @xmath19 is approximately given by @xmath46 independent of the doping concentration as well as the chemical structures for these multilayer compounds .",
