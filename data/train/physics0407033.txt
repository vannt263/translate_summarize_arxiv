    "a liquid xenon  ( lxe ) scintillation @xmath1 ray detector is being developed for the meg experiment which will search for @xmath2  decay at the paul scherrer institut  @xcite .",
    "the meg experiment aims to improve the sensitivity by at least two orders of magnitude over the previous experiment  @xcite and to reach a @xmath2  branching ratio that is predicted by theories of supersymmetric grand unification  @xcite and supersymmetric theories with right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the lxe detector is an indispensable component of the experiment that enables to achieve such a superior sensitivity with its excellent performance in @xmath1 ray measurement .",
    "it will have an active lxe volume of 800  @xmath0 surrounded by 800 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) viewing inside  @xcite .",
    "the detector utilizes only scintillation light without any attempt to measure ionization .",
    "the principle of the detector has been successfully demonstrated by a small prototype with an active lxe volume of 2.34  @xmath0 surrounded by 32 pmts  @xcite .",
    "however , since such a large lxe detector has never been built , nobody has verified long distance transparency of lxe for the vacuum ultra violet ( vuv ) scintillation light of xenon .",
    "while lxe itself should never absorb the scintillation , practically unavoidable impurities might deteriorate the transparency and thus the performance of the detector .",
    "we have recently built a 100  @xmath0 prototype with an active volume of @xmath3  mm@xmath4 ( 69  @xmath0 ) surrounded by 228 pmts to gain practical experiences in operating such a device and to prove its excellent performance . in this paper",
    "we describe how this prototype has been used to evaluate the absorption of the scintillation light in lxe .",
    "based on the obtained result , the effects of the light absorption on the energy resolution are estimated by monte carlo simulation .",
    "we discuss here the optical properties of lxe that are of interest for a scintillation detector .",
    "the main optical properties of lxe are listed in table  [ tab : xeprop ] .",
    ".optical properties of lxe . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the detector requires a total of about 100  @xmath0 of lxe .",
    "some preparations are needed to bring it into operational conditions . once in operation",
    ", the gains of the pmts are measured with the blue leds and adjusted by changing the high voltage .",
    "the effective quantum efficiencies ( qe ) are estimated by measuring scintillation spectra of the @xmath5 sources in gxe at 170  k , close to the liquid temperature .      both the inner and outer vessels are initially evacuated .",
    "while being evacuated , the inner vessel is baked at the rather low temperature of @xmath6c because of the pmts and acrylics inside the vessel .",
    "after a continuous evacuation for about ten days , the inner pressure reaches @xmath7  pa .    in order to cool the inner vessel down to 165  k prior to xenon liquefaction ( pre - cooling ) , it is first filled with gxe at 0.2  mpa and then cooled for a whole day by the combined action of the pulse tube refrigerator and liquid nitrogen flowing through a coiled stainless steel pipe in the inner vessel .",
    "the refrigerator , operating quietly with no moving parts near the cooling head , does not require frequent interruptions for maintenance  @xcite .    when the inner vessel is sufficiently pre - cooled , xenon is finally liquefied by using liquid nitrogen and the refrigerator .",
    "gxe flows through a gas purifier ( saes getter@xcite ) and molecular filters ( oxisorbs  @xcite ) before entering the vessel and getting liquefied .",
    "the gas purifier absorbs various contaminants such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 down to the ppb level .",
    "the molecular filters act as an additional oxygen trap .",
    "it usually takes two days to liquefy 100  @xmath0 of lxe . the vapor pressure in the inner vessel is continuously monitored to regulate the flow of liquid nitrogen .",
    "after liquefaction , lxe is maintained at 168  k and 0.13  mpa mainly by the refrigerator .",
    "for the measurement described later in this paper , the detector was kept in operation continuously for approximately 2000  hours .",
    "after detector operation xenon is recovered to a storage tank .",
    "the refrigerator is turned off , the outer vessel is filled with nitrogen gas of room temperature , and a heater under the pmt holder is switched on to accelerate lxe evaporation . the storage tank is cooled down by liquid nitrogen in order to re - condense the xenon flowing from the detector vessel .",
    "recovery and warming up of the cryostat take two and four days , respectively .",
    "a precise knowledge of pmt gains and quantum efficiencies is necessary to have an excellent energy resolution .",
    "the blue leds and the @xmath10am @xmath5 sources placed inside the detector are used for the calibration of the pmts .      during data acquisition , that lasted over 2000 hours , the gain of each pmt",
    "was monitored twice a day by flashing , at a time , a pair of leds facing each other at 100  hz by led drivers  ( caen c529  @xcite ) at several different intensities . a typical adc spectrum of the pmt outputs in one of these led runs is shown in fig .  [ fig : ledcal ]  ( a ) . assuming negligible fluctuations of the leds intensity",
    ", the gain @xmath11 can be given by the following equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the charge per adc channel  ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the standard deviation and the mean of adc spectrum , respectively , and @xmath17 is the electron charge magnitude . here",
    "it is assumed that the number of photoelectrons  ( @xmath18 ) observed on a pmt is reasonably large so that the spectrum can be regarded as gaussian . in practice",
    "we have to consider a contribution from the pedestal as in the following equation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean and the standard deviation of the pedestal .",
    "[ fig : ledcal ]  ( b ) shows an example of the linear relation between @xmath22 and @xmath16 .",
    "the gain of the pmt is evaluated by fitting the data with eq .",
    "[ eq : gain2 ] . to evaluate reliability of the obtained results , the procedure was repeated both by using different led pairs and by using the same pair in several consecutive runs .",
    "the results were reproduced within 0.9  % in fwhm , which gives a negligible contribution to the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "quantum efficiencies ( qes ) of the pmts depend on the temperature and the light wavelength and must be evaluated in the operational conditions .",
    "they were evaluated by using the @xmath5 sources with 0.13  mpa gxe at 170  k. the use of gaseous xenon is necessary to avoid scattering and possible absorption of the scintillation photons , which are more prominent in liquid phase .",
    "the scintillation spectra in liquid and gaseous phases are not much different  @xcite .",
    "qes for individual pmts were evaluated by comparing the measured spectra with a geant3 simulation  @xcite .",
    "the obtained qe distribution for all the pmts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qe ] . the low values and",
    "the broad spread of qes are thought to be due to the increased photo - cathode resistivity at low temperature and the difficult evaporation procedure of the photo - cathode .",
    "the @xmath5 sources were also used for monitoring the stability of the pmts during the data taking in liquid phase .",
    "it is found that the pmt outputs stabilize in about 50 hours after the liquefaction and are stable within 0.5  % thereafter .",
    "lxe should in principle be transparent to its own scintillation light thanks to the scintillation mechanism through the excimer state @xmath23  @xcite",
    ". however possible contaminants in lxe , such as water and oxygen at ppm level , considerably absorb scintillation light  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contami ]  ( a ) the absorption coefficient for vuv light is shown for 1 ppm contamination of water vapor .",
    "the absorption spectra of water and oxygen largely overlap with the xenon scintillation spectrum . given these absorption coefficients and neglecting the scattering ( @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 )",
    ", we calculated the light intensity as a function of the distance from the light source for various concentrations of the contaminant . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : contami ]  ( b ) for water . since water tends to absorb light with shorter wavelengths , only a component with longer wavelengths survives for a long distance .",
    "this might explain the discrepancies among the measurements of the lxe refractive index @xmath27 , as @xmath27 varies rapidly as a function of the wavelength in the vicinity of the scintillation wavelength .",
    "as we already noted , xenon is well purified before filling the detector vessel , but some inner components of the prototype are made of g10 and acrylic that are known to absorb and desorb water . during the initial stage of the prototype operation , a strong absorption of scintillation light was observed . after systematic studies on the residual gas by means of mass spectroscopy and build - up tests , we concluded that water at the ppm level seemed to be desorbed from the detector material into lxe .",
    "we therefore introduced a circulation - purification system , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circle ] , to remove the water . in this system ,",
    "xenon , taken from the bottom of the vessel through the teflon tube and evaporated by the heat exchanger , is pumped by a diaphragm pump and circulated through the gas purifiers and the molecular filters , and is finally condensed back into the detector .",
    "the flow rate of gxe is about 500  @xmath28/min , hence the whole volume could be circulated in a few month time .",
    "we also carried out various tests to study the purification process , such as stopping or changing the flow rate and bypassing the purifiers or the filters .",
    "purification was continuously performed for over 1200 hours . to evaluate and monitor light absorption in lxe separately from rayleigh scattering during purification , we used cosmic ray muons as well as the @xmath5 sources .",
    "the total number of photoelectrons collected by all the pmts ( @xmath29 ) for each cosmic ray event , being sensitive only to the loss of the scintillation photons , is a good measure of the light absorption . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crnpe ] ( a ) , @xmath29  is plotted as a function of time .",
    "it increased by a factor four in about one month ( 700  hours ) and almost saturated . a comparison with a monte carlo simulation indicates that @xmath24  increased from @xmath30  cm to above 1  m.    in fig .",
    "[ fig : crnpe ] ( b ) the relative changes in the @xmath5 peaks of the pmts located at certain distances ( 7.6  cm and 11.6  cm ) from the @xmath5 sources are plotted . for the pmts at a longer distance ,",
    "the pmt outputs increased much more significantly and saturated slightly later , just as expected for the light absorption in lxe .",
    "we first made a crude estimate of the rayleigh scattering length by using the pmts located on the same face as the @xmath5 source ; these pmts can not directly see the scintillation light from the @xmath5 particles but only the scattered light .",
    "our data prefer values of @xmath26@xmath31 40 - 50  cm , which are consistent with the numbers currently available in the literature  @xcite .    to evaluate the absorption length @xmath24 , we compared the pmt outputs in the lxe to those in the gxe and to a monte carlo simulation with no absorption and a variable @xmath26 .",
    "note that both absorption and scattering are negligible in the gxe . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] the pmt outputs normalized either to those in the gxe ( a ) or to the mc simulation with @xmath26@xmath32  cm ( b ) are plotted against the source - pmt distance . here the distributions at the beginning of purification ( open circles ) and after one month of purification ( closed circles ) are compared .",
    "the evident exponential decline at the beginning almost vanished after purification .",
    "these distributions were then fitted with exponential functions . from the comparison with the gxe data",
    "an effective attenuation length of @xmath33  cm was obtained after the purification .",
    "this effective length contains the effects of both the absorption and the rayleigh scattering .",
    "since the scattered photons are not totally lost but may be detected by other pmts , the obtained effective attenuation length is longer than @xmath34  and , especially if @xmath24@xmath35@xmath26 , it is longer than @xmath26 . note that the lxe / gxe ratio is larger than unity since the ratio of the scintillation yields in lxe and gxe is approximately 2.7  @xcite .    the comparison with the simulation does not show a significant slope .",
    "we used this result to establish a lower limit on the absorption length @xmath24  of 90  cm at 90  % confidence level , where @xmath26  was varied from 30  cm to 50  cm in the simulation . before the purification @xmath24  was @xmath36  cm .",
    "we conclude that the level of water content after the purification was much lower than 100  ppb .    after successful purification of lxe under the operational conditions",
    ", efforts have been focused on reducing the initial amount of water contamination in the vessel .",
    "we replaced most of the acrylic parts with teflon to suppress out - gassing in the inner chamber , which resulted in an initial absorption length @xmath24  of 30  cm in the subsequent operation .",
    "a lower limit on the absorption length @xmath24  of 100  cm at 90  % confidence level was then achieved in a much shorter time of xenon purification , in about 300  hours .",
    "we are also developing a liquid - phase purification system with a fluid pump to increase the purification efficiency .",
    "in such a system the circulation speed could be increased up to 100  @xmath0/hour of lxe , more than 1000 times faster than the current system .",
    "in this section we estimate the performance of the 100  @xmath0 lxe prototype for 52.8  mev @xmath1 rays that are expected from the @xmath2  decays .",
    "simulations show that the determination of the incident positions of the @xmath1 rays is only slightly affected by absorption and rayleigh scattering . on the contrary",
    "the energy resolution is heavily dependent on the absorption mainly because of fluctuations in light collection efficiency . for a short absorption length the total amount of light collected by the pmts",
    "depends strongly on the positions of the energy deposits .",
    "although corrections for the first @xmath1 ray conversion points may be straightforward , the total light yield just fluctuates according with the event - by - event shower fluctuations .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the detector performance in energy measurement of @xmath1 rays in the following .    for negligible absorption ( i.e. @xmath24@xmath35 the detector size )",
    "the @xmath1 ray energy may be simply evaluated by the total sum of the photons collected by all the pmts , possibly weighted by the local density of the pmts . for a finite absorption length",
    ", however , a better method of summing the pmt outputs is necessary .",
    "the @xmath1 ray energy @xmath37 may be calculated as a linear sum of the pmt outputs @xmath38 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath39 : @xmath40 to optimize the coefficients we may use simulated events with the @xmath1 ray energy of @xmath41 and minimize @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average of @xmath44 over the simulated events .",
    "the minimization is straightforward and yields the following result : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is just the covariance matrix of @xmath38 for the simulated events , @xmath47 .",
    "this method is called `` linear fit '' and its validity is based on the principal component analysis  @xcite .    using the linear fit , a reconstructed energy spectrum for 52.8  mev monochromatic @xmath1 rays that uniformly irradiate the center of the detector face",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a100hst ] .",
    "the spectrum has an asymmetric shape .",
    "the lower tail is caused by interactions of the @xmath1 rays in the materials before the lxe and by a leakage of shower components ( mostly low energy @xmath1 rays ) .",
    "most important for the @xmath2  experiment is the resolution at the upper edge ( @xmath48 ) to reject background events , while the lower tail concerns the detection efficiency .",
    "the spectrum was fitted to the following function to evaluate @xmath48 : @xmath49 \\displaystyle { \\exp\\left\\{\\frac{(e-\\mu)^2}{-2\\sigma_\\mathrm{u}^2}\\right\\}},\\qquad&e>\\mu+t , \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 were also determined in the fit .",
    "the obtained resolutions in fwhm and @xmath48 for 52.8  mev @xmath1 rays are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eresoabs ] as a function of the absorption lengths assumed in the simulation .",
    "the resolutions for two incident positions a and b described in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : eresoabs ] are similar , indicating a small position dependence .",
    "the resolutions are also stable by changing @xmath26@xmath52  cm and for @xmath53 for lxe .",
    "note that in the simulation refraction , reflection and absorption of the scintillation light at the pmt quartz windows are taken into account .    with the achieved absorption length of @xmath24@xmath54  cm an energy resolution of 4  % fwhm and @xmath55  % , averaged over the detector acceptance ,",
    "is expected from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the detection efficiency is estimated to be approximately 60  % for @xmath24@xmath56  cm if selected within @xmath57  % around the energy peak .",
    "we are developing a lxe @xmath1 ray detector for the meg experiment .",
    "a 100  @xmath0 prototype with an active volume of @xmath3  mm@xmath4 was constructed to examine its performance for 52.8-mev @xmath1 rays that are expected from @xmath2  decays . we have established a long stable operation of this new type of device by successfully running it for approximately 2000  hours without interruptions .",
    "absorption of the vacuum ultra violet scintillation light of xenon by possible impurities might critically limit the performance of the detector .",
