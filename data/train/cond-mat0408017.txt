    "we are surrounded by waves , and they effect our daily life in a way that many of us are not aware .",
    "sound and light are our main tools for observing our immediate surroundings .",
    "light is for example responsible for you being able to read these lines , and more important , to get access to the vast majority of the knowledge accumulated in writings by man throughout centuries of intellectual activities .",
    "x - ray and ultra sound techniques have given tremendous contribution to the success of modern medicine .",
    "radio- and micro - waves are invaluable in modern communication technology including cellular phones and radio and tv broadcastings .",
    "understanding of quantum waves , and their behavior , constitutes the foundation of electronics and semiconductor technologies  an essential ingredient in the past and future progress of computer hardware .",
    "the above list is not at all , or intended to be , complete .",
    "it could in fact easily been made much longer .",
    "however , the bottom line that we want to make here is that with the ubiquitous presence of wave phenomena in various applications , it is not surprising to find that wave phenomena have had , and still have , a prominent position in our studies of the physical world , and even today such phenomena are of out - most importance in science , medicine and technology .",
    "if you take an average introductionary text on wave phenomena , you will find discussions of how plane waves of constant frequency propagates in a homogeneous , isotropic medium .",
    "thereafter , the authors typically discuss the scattering and transmission of such waves at a _",
    "planar _ interface separating two semi - infinite media of different dielectric properties  @xcite  the fresnel formulae .",
    "these formulae serve to accurately describe the scattering of light from for example a mirror .",
    "however , from our everyday experience , we know that most surfaces are not mirror like , and naturally occurring objects are more complicated then two semi - infinite media .",
    "most naturally occurring surfaces are actually not smooth at all .",
    "they are , however , rough in some sense .",
    "in fact , all objects , man - made or not , _ have _ to be rough at atomic scales , but such small length scales are normally not resolved by our probes .    it should be kept in mind that the characterization of a surface as rough or smooth is noticeably not unique , and it is not a intrinsic property of the surface . instead , however , it depends on the wavelength used to `` observe '' the surface .",
    "if the typical roughness is on a scale much smaller then the wavelength of the probe , this surface is considered as smooth . however , by reducing the wavelength of the light , the same surface might also be characterized as being rough .",
    "it is , among other factors , the surface topography and the wavelength of the probe , as we will see below , that together go into the characterization of a surface as being rough .",
    "let us from now on assume an electromagnetic probe , _",
    "i.e. _ light .",
    "if the surface can be considered as smooth , light is scattered ( coherently ) into the specular direction . as the roughness of the surface",
    "is increased so that the surface becomes weakly rough , a small fraction of the incident light will be scattered into other directions than the specular one .",
    "this non - specular scattering is called _ diffuse scattering _ or by some authors _ incoherent scattering_. as the roughness is increased even further , the diffuse ( incoherent ) component of the scattered light is increased on the expense of the specular component .",
    "when the surface roughness is so that the specular component can be more - or - less neglected as compared to the diffuse component , the surface is said to be strongly rough .",
    "this transmission from as smooth to a strongly rough surface is depict in figs .",
    "[ fig : planar_to_rough ] .    due to the practical applications of waves , and the number of naturally occurring surfaces being rough , it is rather remarkable that it took several hundreds years from the birth of optics as a scientific discipline to someone started to considered wave scattering from rough surfaces .",
    "as far as we know today , the first such theoretical study was made at the end of the 19th century ( probably in the year of 1877 ) by one of the greatest scientists of its time , the british physicist lord rayleigh  @xcite .",
    "he considered the scattering of light incident normally onto a sinusoidal surface .    in 1913",
    "mandelshtam studied how light was scattered from liquid surfaces  @xcite . by doing so",
    ", he became the first to consider scattering from _ randomly _ rough surfaces .",
    "this , as it turned out , should define the beginning of an active research area  _ wave scattering from randomly rough surfaces _  which still today is an active field .",
    "however , it was first after the last world war that the research effort put into the field stated to accelerate  @xcite .",
    "since that time , a massive body of research literature has been generated in the field  @xcite .",
    "up to the mid 1980 s most of the theories used in this field were single scattering theories  @xcite .",
    "however , from then on the main focus of the research has been on multiple scattering theories .",
    "in addition , advances in experimental techniques has lately enabled experimentalists to fabricate surfaces under well controlled conditions by using a holographic grating technique  @xcite .",
    "this has opened up a unique possibility for direct comparison of theory and experiments in a way not possible a few decades ago .    inspired by the works of lord rayleigh  @xcite researchers developed a criterion  the rayleigh criterion  that could be used to determine when a given surface was to be considered as rough . here",
    "both the wavelength of the incident light as well as its angle of incidence are incorporated  @xcite .    to illustrate how this comes about ,",
    "let us consider a rough surface defined by @xmath0 . on this surface",
    "we pick two arbitrary points @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it could now be asked : what is the phase difference between two waves being scattered from these two points ?",
    "for simplicity we will here only consider the specular direction . under this assumption",
    "it is straight forward to show that the phase difference is given by the following expression @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the modulus of the wave vector of the incident light of wavelength @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the angle of incidence of the light as measured from the normal to the mean surface . from eq .",
    "@xmath7 we immediately observe that if the surface is planar , so that @xmath8 , the phase difference ( in the specular direction ) is always zero independent of the angle of incidence .",
    "however , if the surface is rough , @xmath9 in general .",
    "if @xmath10 , the two waves will be in , or almost in , phase and they will thus interfere constructively . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath11 , they will be ( more - or - less ) completely out off phase and as a result interfere destructively , and no , or almost no , energy will be scattered into the specular direction . in terms of the phase",
    ", a smooth surface would correspond to @xmath10 , and a rough one to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 might be considered as the borderline between a smooth and a rough surface ; if @xmath13 the surface is smooth , and otherwise ( @xmath14 ) it is rough .",
    "the criterion @xmath15 is the famous rayleigh criterion for a smooth surface .",
    "if the surface is randomly rough , it is practical to replace the height difference @xmath16 by a typical height fluctuation as provided , for example , by the rms - height , @xmath17 , of the surface .",
    "hence , the rayleigh criterion can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so - called rayleigh parameter . from the rayleigh criterion , @xmath20",
    ", it should be observed that in addition to the surface topography itself and the wavelength of the light , also its angle of incidence goes into determining if a surface is rough or not .",
    "this is probably the most important lesson to be learned today from the rayleigh criterion .    the present review consists of basically two main parts  one focus theoretical methods whilst the other one is devoted to rough surface scattering phenomenology . in the first part we try to present an overview of some of the main theories and methods used in the study of wave scattering from randomly rough surfaces .",
    "we start in sect .",
    "[ chapter : elmag ] by recapitulating the basic results of electromagnetic theory including maxwell s equations .",
    "this section serves among other things to define our notation .",
    "then we continue by describing how to characterize randomly rough surfaces ( sect .",
    "[ chap : characterization ] ) . sect .",
    "[ chap : theory ] is devoted to the quantities and main techniques used in the field of electromagnetic wave scattering from randomly rough surfaces .",
    "we here review classical theories like small amplitude perturbation theory , many - body perturbation theory as well as numerical simulation approaches . finally in sect .",
    "[ chapt : phenomena ] we discuss some of the phenomena that may occur when light is scattered from rough surfaces .",
    "such effects include the backscattering and satellite peaks phenomena ( weak localization ) , anderson localization , angular intensity correlation effects and nonlinear effects ( second harmonic generation ) .",
    "the present review mainly concern itself with rough surfaces and the scattering of electromagnetic wave from such . in this section",
    "we therefor review some of the basic results of electromagnetic theory , including surface polaritons .",
    "the present section also serves to define our notation that we will use extensively in the following sections .",
    "the style of this review is kept quite brief , since all the material should be well known .",
    "a more thorough treatments can be found for example in the classical text on electrodynamics by j.  d.  jackson  @xcite .",
    ".summary of the quantities contained in maxwell s equations , as well as their si - units . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it should also be noticed , as was realized recently  @xcite , that a measurement of the angular intensity correlations can provide valuable information regarding the statistical properties of the amplitude of the scattered field .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the short - range correlation function @xmath21 is in a sense a measure of the non - circularity of the complex gaussian statistics of the scattering matrix . if the random surface is such that only the @xmath22 and @xmath21 correlation functions are observed , then @xmath23 obeys complex gaussian statistics .",
    "if the random surface is such that only @xmath22 is observed , then @xmath23 obeys circular complex gaussian statistics and @xmath24 are said to be _ circular _ complex gaussian if  @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26 . ] .",
    "this can indeed be seen from fig .",
    "[ phen : corr : comp - sim]b , which shows that as the surface is made rougher , and therefore @xmath27 approaches a circular complex gaussian process , the @xmath21-correlation vanishes as compared to @xmath22 . finally , if the random surface is such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are observed in addition to both @xmath22 and @xmath21 , then @xmath31 is not a gaussian random process at all .",
    "however , which kind of statistics @xmath31 satisfies in this case is not clear for the moment .",
    "these results fits the findings from standard speckle theory  @xcite which assumes that the disorder is strong and that @xmath31 constitutes a circular complex gaussian process .",
    "so far in this section , we have discussed exclusively rough surface scattering phenomena that find their explanation within linear electromagnetic theory .",
    "there are still many exciting nonlinear  @xcite surface scattering effects that have to be addressed in the future .",
    "such nonlinear studies are still at their early beginning .",
    "the studies that have been conducted so far on nonlinear surface scattering effects have mainly been related to the angular distribution of the scattered _ second harmonic _ generated light  @xcite .",
    "in particular what have been studied are some new features in the backscattering directions of the second harmonic light . in this section",
    "we will discuss some of these results .",
    "the presentation given below follows closely the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known from solid state physics that an ( infinite ) homogeneous and isotropic metal has inversion symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this is that there is no nonlinear polarization in the bulk . if , however , the metal is semi - infinite with an interface to vacuum , say , the inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "thus , a nonlinear polarization , different from zero , will exist close to the surface .",
    "as we move into the bulk of the metal , this effect will become smaller and smaller and finally vanish .",
    "therefore , one might talk about a nonlinear surface layer which through nonlinear interactions will give rise to light that is scattered away from the rough surface at the second harmonic frequency .    the scattering system that we will be considering is the by now standard one depicted in fig .  [ fig : theory : geometry ] .",
    "this geometry is illuminated from the vacuum side , @xmath32 , by a @xmath33-polarized planar wave of ( fundamental ) frequency @xmath34 .",
    "only the @xmath33-polarized component of the scattered second harmonic generated light will be considered here , even though there also will exit a weak @xmath35-polarized component due to the nonlinear interaction at the surface .",
    "however , the @xmath33-polarized component represents the main contribution to the scattered light at the second harmonic frequency @xmath36 , and will therefore be our main concern here",

    "so what is the reason for the dip in the second harmonic light ?",
    "odonnell and torre  @xcite , who conducted the experiments leading to the experimental results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : phen : sh - experimental ] , suggested that these dips were due to coherent effects .",

    "thus , the advance most needed in the field are techniques , either numerical or analytical , that accurately and fast can handle electromagnetic wave scattering from two - dimensional surfaces of varying rms - height . two - dimensional weakly rough surfaces can be treated by perturbation theory  @xcite , but if the surface is not weakly rough this approach is not adequate any more . in principle a general solution of the scattering problem can be formulated on the basis of a vector version of the extinction theorem  @xcite . however , the resulting system of linear equations that needs to be solved in order to calculate the source functions is so big , and therefore require so much computer memory , that it for the moment is not practical in general  @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to come up with new and more efficient methods for solving this kind of problems , or , the less appealing approach , to wait for advances in computer technology to make the extinction theorem approach tractable from a computational point of view .",
    "the scientific community dealing with wave scattering from disordered systems , seems to be divided into two separate groups : ( _ i _ ) those that deal with surface disordered systems and ( _ ii _ ) those that concentrate on systems with volume disorder . in the future",
    "these two `` groups '' have to be unified to a much higher degree then what is the case today in order to deal with scattering systems consisting of bulk disorder materials bounded by a random surface .",
    "strictly speaking there has already been published some works for such `` dual '' disordered systems  @xcite , but still more work , and in a more general framework , need to be done for such problems .",
    "an area that needs to be addressed further in the future is the _ inverse scattering problem_@xcite in contrast to the forward scattering problem that is the one that has received the most attention in theoretical studies of wave scattering from randomly rough surfaces . in the inverse scattering problem one has information , _",
    "e.g. _ from experiments , about the angular dependence of the scattered light and one is interested in trying to reconstruct the surface profile function or its statistical properties .",
    "this problem is quite difficult and huge research efforts have been spent on it in related fields like remote sensing and seismic in order to try to find its solution .",
    "so far a general solution to the problem has not been found .",
