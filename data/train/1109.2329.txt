    "the higgs boson mass in the standard model ( sm ) is not stable against qunatum corrections and has quadratic divergences . because the reduced planck scale is about 16 order larger than the electroweak ( ew ) scale , there exists huge fine - tuning to have the ew - scale higgs boson mass , which is called the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry is a symmetry between the bosonic and fermionic states , and it naturally solves this problem due to the cancellations between the bosonic and fermionic quantum corrections .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with @xmath2 parity under which the sm particles are even while the supersymmetric particles ( sparticles ) are odd , the @xmath3 gauge couplings can be unified around @xmath4 gev  @xcite , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) such as the neutralino can be a cold dark matter candidate  @xcite , and the ew precision constraints can be evaded , etc .",
    "especially , the gauge coupling unification strongly suggests grand unified theories ( guts ) , which can explain the sm fermion quantum numbers .",
    "however , in the supersymmetric @xmath5 models , there exist the doublet - triplet splitting problem and dimension - five proton decay problem .",
    "interestingly , these problems can be solved elegantly in the flipped @xmath0 models via missing partner mechanism  @xcite .",
    "previously , the flipped @xmath0 models have been constructed systematically in the free fermionic string constructions at the kac - moody level one  @xcite . to solve the little hierarchy problem between the traditional unification scale and the string scale ,",
    "two of us ( tl and dvn ) with jiang have proposed the testable flipped @xmath0 models , where the tev - scale vector - like particles are introduced  @xcite .",
    "there is a two - step unifcation : the @xmath1 gauge couplings are unified at the scale @xmath6 around the usual gut scale , and the @xmath0 gauge couplings are unified at the final unification scale @xmath7 around @xmath8 gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such kind of models have been constructed locally from the f - theory model building  @xcite , and are dubbed as @xmath9-@xmath5  @xcite . in particular , these models are very interesting from the phenomenological point of view  @xcite : the vector - like particles can be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , proton decay is within the reach of the future hyper - kamiokande  @xcite and deep underground science and engineering laboratory ( dusel )  @xcite experiments  @xcite , the hybrid inflation can be naturally realized , and the correct cosmic primodial density fluctuations can be generated  @xcite .    with no - scale boundary conditions at @xmath7",
    "@xcite , two of us ( tl and dvn ) with maxin and walker have described an extraordinarily constrained `` golden point ''  @xcite and `` golden strip ''  @xcite that satisfied all the latest experimental constraints and has an imminently observable proton decay rate  @xcite . especially , the uv boundary condition @xmath10 gives very strong constraint on the viable parameter space , where @xmath11 is the soft bilinear higgs mass term in the mssm .",
    "in addition , exploiting a `` super - no - scale '' condition , we dynamically determined the universal gaugino mass @xmath12 and the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath13 . since @xmath12 is related to the modulus field of the internal space in string models , we stabilized the modulus dynamically  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the supersymmetric particle ( sparticle ) spectra generially have a light stop and gluino , which are lighter than all the other squarks .",
    "thus , we can test such kinds of models at the lhc by looking for the ultra high jet signals  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the complete viable parameter space in no - scale @xmath14-@xmath5 has been studied by considering a set of `` bare minimal '' experimental constaints  @xcite . for the other lhc and dark matter phenomenological studies ,",

    "@xcite .",
    "it is well known that one of main lhc goals is to detect the sm or sm - like higgs boson .",
    "recently , both the cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite collaborations have presented their combined searches for the sm higgs boson , base on the integrated luminosities between @xmath15 and @xmath16 depending on the search channels . for the light sm higgs boson mass region preferred by the ew precision data , they have excluded the sm higgs boson with mass larger than 145 gev and 146 gev , respectively . in the no - scale @xmath14-@xmath5 , the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass is generically about 120 gev if the contributions from the vector - like particles are neglected  @xcite .",
    "thus , the interesting question is whether the lightest cp - even higgs boson can have mass up to 146 gev naturally if we include the contributions from the additional vector - like particles .    in this paper , we consider five kinds of testable flipped @xmath0 models from f - theoy",

    "i.e. _ , the yukawa coupling squares are less than @xmath18 . with the two - loop renormalization group equation ( rge ) running for the gauge couplings and yukawa couplings , we obtain the maximal yukawa couplings for the tev - scale vector - like particles . to calculate the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass upper bounds",
