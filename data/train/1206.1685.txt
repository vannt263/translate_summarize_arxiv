    "inflation @xcite is becoming a standard model for the very early universe . the inflationary scenario ,",
    "in which the present universe is only a small local patch of a causally connected region at early times which underwent an exponential expansion driven by the inflaton potential , is generally accepted for explaining the observed spatially flat and homogeneous universe .",
    "in addition , its quantum fluctuations during inflation give rise to primordial gaussian matter density fluctuations with a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum , which is consistent with recent astrophysical and cosmological observations such as structure formation and cosmic microwave background anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "although the simplest single - field , slow - roll inflation model works well , some basic questions have yet to be answered . what is the origin of the inflaton potential ?",
    "do classical matter density imhomogenities that we observe today genuinely come from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton ?",
    "are the observed matter density fluctuations truly gaussian",
    "? how robust are the predictions for a subdominant contribution of tensor modes to the metric fluctuations , a slightly broken scale invariance , and a negligible running spectral index of the power spectrum ?",
    "future cosmic microwave background measurements and mega - scale mappings of the large scale structure will definitely answer some of these questions or perhaps pose a challenge to the standard inflation scenario .",
    "there has been a lot of studies on inflationary models that go beyond the simplest single - field , slow - roll inflation .",
    "a class of models has considered a new source for generating inflaton fluctuations ( so - called passive density fluctuations ) during inflation through a direct or gravitational coupling between the inflaton and other quantum fields .",
    "this leads to very interesting results such as the so - called warm inflation  @xcite , the suppression of large - scale density fluctuations  @xcite , possible constraints on the duration of inflationary expansion  @xcite .",
    "the bursts of particle production that result in infra - red cascading  @xcite , the trapped inflation in which the inflaton rolls slowly down a steep potential by dumping its kinetic energy into light particles at the trapping points along the inflaton trajectory  @xcite , and electromagnetic dissipation in natural inflation  @xcite .    in all of these papers , essentially , the generation of passive density fluctuations is originated from quantum fluctuations in the back reaction of the couplings to the inflaton perturbation .",
    "the nature of passive fluctuations is usually non - gaussian and non - scale - invariant .",
    "a particular feature is that the power spectrum of the passive fluctuations can be very blue  @xcite .",
    "these passive fluctuations can not dominate the primordial density perturbation at large scales as confirmed by cosmological observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the formation of large scale structures .",
    "however , depending on individual models , their significant contribution to the non - gaussianity is still possible .",
    "this will be tested soon in the planck cmb mission and in future large - scale - structure surveys . in this paper",
    ", we point out that the passive fluctuations with a blue spectrum can dominate the primordial density perturbation in the very small scales , seeding the formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) in the radiation - domination era after inflation .",
    "let us consider a slow - rolling inflaton @xmath1 coupled to a certain quantum field @xmath2 .",
    "the lagrangian that is relevant to @xmath1 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inflaton potential , @xmath5 is the interaction term , and the metric is @xmath6 the equations of motion for the mean fields are then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy density of @xmath2 particles , the dot and the prime denote differentiating with respect to time and @xmath1 respectively , and @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass . in eq .",
    "( [ backreaction ] ) , the righthand side of the equation is the back reaction of the interaction to the inflaton mean field .",
    "the back reaction arises due to copious production of @xmath2 quanta during inflation .",
    "in addition , the fluctuations of @xmath1 satisfy @xmath10 the homogeneous solution of this fluctuation equation gives rise to the standard primordial density fluctuations .",
    "here we call them as active fluctuations and denote their power spectrum by @xmath11 . the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ flucteqn ] ) , which comes from the fluctuations of the backreaction , acts as a source for generating additional fluctuations of @xmath1 .",
    "the particular solution of eq .",
    "( [ flucteqn ] ) with the source term is referred as passive fluctuations and the power spectrum is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the total power spectrum is given by the contributions from both active fluctuations and passive fluctuations as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fourier mode of @xmath15 .",
    "for single - field slow - roll inflation , the spectrum from active fluctuations is given by @xmath16 where the slow - roll parameter is @xmath17    in a given region with radius @xmath18 , the criteria of black hole formation is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is newton s constant and @xmath21 is the mass inside the region @xmath18 .",
    "the condition can be expressed by using the energy density @xmath22 as @xmath23    the primordial density perturbation can be imagined as density fluctuation between different hubble patches of the universe ( so called ` separate universes ' @xcite ) with radius @xmath24 .",
    "namely , in each patch of the universe , the energy density is regarded as homogeneous but each patch has different value of energy density .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) becomes @xmath25 where in the second equality friedmann equation ( @xmath26 ) is used and @xmath27 should be regarded as the average of many patches . from this simple estimation , we can naively guess that if @xmath28 , the whole patch of the separate universe will colapse into a black hole .",
    "the argument here is heuristic one . for those who concern about the gauge dependence of density fluctuation",
    ", our argument has assumed a spatially flat gauge in which we choose a slice with zero curvature perturbation and hence the relevant quantity is density fluctuation .",
    "more rigorous calculation for the condition of primordial black hole formation is given by refs .",
    "@xcite as @xmath29 the upper bound is to avoid formation of a separate closed universe .",
    "if the spectrum is @xmath30 , pbhs will be copiously produced @xcite .",
    "this is certainly not the range of the matter power spectrum probed by cmb experiments .",
    "the range corresponds to the scale of quantum fluctuations that exits the horizon during inflation at a number of e - folds , @xmath31 , before inflation ends .",
    "it is because we have @xmath32 from cmb observations .",
    "however , the spectrum can be large near the end of inflation , @xmath33 in this case black holes will form soon after inflation when the scale enters the horizon .",
    "these black holes are called primordial black holes ( pbhs ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) . the spectrum from active fluctuations is ( almost ) scale invariant , therefore",
    "unless the running spectral index is large , pbhs can not be formed  @xcite .",
    "we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) that the slow - roll parameter @xmath34 has to decrease toward the end of inflation in order to enhance the ( active ) spectrum .",
    "however , inflation has to end so the usual tendency is an increasing @xmath34 .",
    "this is the reason why it is so difficult to have pbhs ( for single - field slow - roll inflation with active fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "however , we point out for the first time that it is very natural and easy to have pbhs formed even in the case of single - field slow - roll inflation if we consider passive fluctuations .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the passive fluctuations in different inflation models and explore the possibility of forming primordial black holes from the passive fluctuations .",
    "let us consider the case that the inflaton @xmath1 is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson with a typical potential after the shift symmetry is broken , @xmath35 , \\label{axion}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a mass scale and @xmath37 is the axion decay constant .",
    "and the coupling to a gauge field is @xmath38 this coupling is natural in the sense that there is no symmetry to forbid it .",
    "it is found  @xcite ( and been further analysised in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the inverse decay of the gauge field will enhance the fluctuation of the inflaton field .",
    "the spectrum is given by @xmath39 where the second term corresponds to the passive spectrum @xmath12 and @xmath40    at cmb scale ( @xmath31 ) , large @xmath41 would produce large non - gaussainity according to eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) . therefore , there is an upper bound from cmb data which is roughly @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath41 becomes larger after cmb scale exits horizon .",
    "for example , if we approximate eq .",
    "( [ axion ] ) by a quadratic potential @xmath43 with @xmath44 which is a good approximation when @xmath45 , which is not phenomenologically desirable , but it can be evaded for example if we consider the potential as an effective potential of n - flation @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for more examples in multi - field or extra - dimensional models where it is very natural to have @xmath46 and @xmath47.]we would have the slow - roll parameter @xmath48 at @xmath31 ( cmb scale ) and @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "this means that @xmath41 grows ten times larger according to eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) . the total spectrum ( near the end of inflation )",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by using eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "we can see from the figure that when @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is satisfied and pbhs would form .",
    "this would correspond to @xmath52 ( noting that this can be achieved by @xmath53 if @xmath46 ) , which is well below the constraint ( @xmath42 ) from refs .",
    "this means that we do not have large non - gaussianity but we have pbhs .",
    "actually the abundance of produced pbhs may put an upper bound on the non - gaussianity generated in this model .",
    "one may concern about the effect of backreaction if we have @xmath54 near the end of inflation .",
    "first of all , this effect is milder in our case than the case where large non - gaussianity is generated at cmb scale . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath41 is expected to grow toward the end of inflation and we consider a smaller value of @xmath41 at @xmath55 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the backreaction to the homogeneous inflaton field due to particle production slows down the inflaton velocity and prolongs the end of inflation ( instead of shortening the period of inflation ) .",
    "however , this does not change our results since the power spectrum depends only on @xmath41 , which in turn depends on the slow - roll parameter @xmath34 , and the end of inflation is determined by @xmath56 .",
    "consider an interaction between @xmath1 and massless scalar @xmath57 of the type , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a coupling constant and @xmath60 is a constant field value .",
    "when @xmath1 rolls down to each trapping point at @xmath60 along the inflaton trajectory , the @xmath57 particles become instantaneously massless and are produced with a number density that increases with @xmath1 s velocity . as @xmath1 dumps its kinetic energy into the @xmath57 particles , it is slowed down and the produced @xmath57 particles are diluted due to the inflationary expansion .",
    "it is useful to define a time scale , @xmath61 .",
    "then , we have @xmath62 for @xmath63 or @xmath64 , it was shown  @xcite that bursts of @xmath57 particle production takes place in a time scale , @xmath65 , and the number density of the @xmath57 particles produced is given by @xmath66 .",
    "this leads to the backreaction of the @xmath57 particle production to the inflaton field in eq .",
    "( [ backreaction ] ) and the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ flucteqn ] ) is particle number density fluctuations in the process of particle production .",
    "furthermore , for closely spaced trapping points with equal spacing @xmath67 along the inflaton trajectory , trapped inflation occurs even on a potential which is too steep for slow - roll inflation , provided that @xmath68  @xcite .    in the case for @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 , it was found  @xcite that @xmath12 has a blue power spectrum . extrapolating the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the total power spectrum in this case is approximately given by @xmath72,\\ ] ] where the pivotal scale @xmath73 , if inflation lasts for about @xmath74 e - folds .",
    "this reproduces the power spectrum in figure  @xmath75 of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 can easily reach unity for small scales that exit horizon before the end of inflation .",
    "here we have assumed that the scale dependence does not change dramatically during inflation when doing the extrapolation .",
    "this is plausible since inflation is ( quasi ) de sitter phase and hence no extra physical effect is expected to change this scaling behavior during inflation .",
    "this blue - tilted behaviour is reasonable because a certain @xmath78-mode is being kicked constantly by the trapping fields all along the inflaton trajectory and the kicks result in accumulative growth of the fluctutations ( see eq .",
    "( 54 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the growth is bigger for higher @xmath78 modes since they leave the horizon later in time .",
    "the last model does not involve a direct non - gravitational interaction between inflaton and other quantum fields as discussed above .",
    "the passive fluctuations come from gravitational effects and are therefore intrinsic and model independent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the effect of quantum stress tensor fluctuations of conformal fields such as conformally coupled massless scalars and electromagnetic fields , denoted by @xmath79 , in de sitter spacetime upon the expansion of a congruence of timelike geodesics .",
    "they found that the quantum stress tensor fluctuations induce a source term on the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ flucteqn ] ) , given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the expansion of the congruence , related to the covariant derivative of the fluid four - velocity by @xmath82 . in the presence of quantum stress tensor fluctuations , they found that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is when inflation begins and @xmath85 is the ricci tensor fluctuations induced by @xmath79 , from which the passive power spectrum was obtained as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the total expansion factor during inflation and @xmath88 is the reheating energy scale at the end of inflation .",
    "for example , if we consider the scale leaving horizon near the end of inflation at which pbhs form , we would have @xmath89 .",
    "assuming that @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we can easily obtain a condition that @xmath92 .",
    "when a pbh forms , roughly speaking the whole horizon collapses into a black hole and therefore the mass is given by the horizon mass , @xmath93 where the last equality assumes radiation domination ( with energy density @xmath94 ) when black holes form , @xmath95 is the solar mass , @xmath96 is the temperature , and @xmath59 is the statistical degrees of freedom . by using the formula of entropy density , @xmath97 ,",
    "the conservation of the total entropy , @xmath98 , implies that @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the pbh mass can also be written as a function of comoving wave number @xmath78 as @xcite @xmath100    for example , if the pbh forms at @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 . a pbh with mass smaller than @xmath103 would have evaporated through hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "pbhs with larger masses contribute to ( or might even dominate ) the dark matter density .",
    "the mass fraction @xmath104 of pbhs of mass @xmath105 is given by  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the mass variance at the horizon crossing .",
    "the range of integration corresponds to  eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) . if pbhs form during the radiation - dominated epoch , @xmath108 .",
    "hence , the density parameter @xmath109 of the pbhs in the present universe is  @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the present hubble constant in units of @xmath112 km / sec / mpc .",
    "for example , if the pbhs with @xmath113 play the role of dark matter in the present universe , i.e. @xmath114 , then @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "for the scale of pbh formation leaving horizon near the end of inflation , we would have @xmath118 . by using eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , we have the pbh mass @xmath119 .",
    "these small black holes would have already evaporated and could not be dark matter . we thus conclude that pbhs generated from scales leaving horizon near the end of inflation are unlikely to become dark matter .",
    "however , if we consider low - scale inflation in which the cmb scale corresponds to @xmath120 , we may have pbhs with @xmath121 that are evaporating now .",
    "this may explain the observed antiproton fluxes from the bess experiment  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , pbhs with @xmath122 can have other cosmological implications . for examples",
    ", they could affect baryogenesis  @xcite and nucleosynthesis  @xcite , swallow monopoles  @xcite , destroy domain walls @xcite , and so on ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed references ) .",
    ", primordial black hole is formed.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "a lot of effort has been put in studying the passive fluctuations during inflation and their imprints on the cmb and in particular the non - gaussian features . however , in this paper we have proposed a novel mechanism that passive fluctuations can produce pbhs with scales exiting horizon near the end of inflation .",
    "this would result in light pbhs with mass @xmath123 that may have interesting cosmological consequences in the early universe .",
    "we have discussed three models in which passive fluctuations can easily generate pbhs , noting that the characteristic power spectrum is rather generic , namely , the spectrum is extremely blue at small scales .",
