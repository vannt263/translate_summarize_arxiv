    "the phenomenology of bl lac objects has led to a classification of these sources into two sub - populations : high - frequency bl lac objects ( hbls ) and low - frequency ones ( lbls ) ( see _ e.g. _ fossati _ et al .",
    "the hbl objects have synchrotron and compton peaks at relatively high energies ( ghisellini _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and thus are good candidates for tev emission . with the hegra system of iacts",
    "the significant detection ( _ e.g. _ @xmath2 3 @xmath3 ) of a flux comparable to the flux from the crab nebula takes less than 15 minutes for sources close to zenith position .",
    "the bl lac observations presented in this paper are thus sufficient to probe energy fluxes down to the level of ( @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "the two bl lac objects mkn 501 and mkn 421 are well established and well studied tev sources .",
    "mkn 501 showed during 1997 spectacular outbursts with diurnal flux levels reaching 10 crab units ( e.g. , aharonian _ et al . _ 1999a ,",
    "_ 1998 , djannati _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and with a spectrum extending up to at least 16 tev ( aharonian _ et al . _",
    "for a better understanding of the intrinsic properties of this class of sources and for determining the amount of intergalactic extinction of the tev photons due to pair production processes with the cosmic infrared background radiation ( cib ) photons , the detection of further bl lac objects is of utmost importance .",
    "thus the search and the detailed study of new extragalactic tev sources is one of the major objectives of the hegra experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the data samples used in the analysis in section 2 and the method used for computing flux upper limits in section 3 .",
    "the extinction by the cib is discussed in section 4 , and in section 5 we give the experimental results . in section 6 and 7",
    "we focus on two objects : ( 1 ) 1es 2344 + 51.4 detected during december 1995 by the whipple cherenkov telescope ( catanese _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , and bl lacertae which , in july 1997 , showed a strong flare detected in gamma - ray by egret , in the visible ( bloom _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; madejski _ et al .",

    "a strategy to optimize the search for new extra - galactic sources is briefly outlined in section 8 , and the conclusions are given in section 9 .",

    "information about the x - ray activity between february 1996 and august 1998 in the energy region 2 - 12 kev is provided by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) ( remillard 1997 ) .",
    "we determined the asm count rates from the `` definitive '' results obtained through analysis of the processed data by the rxte asm team at mit ; data have a dwell duration larger than 30  seconds and a flux fit with a reduced @xmath19-value below 1.5 .",
    "the light curve is extracted using the `` ftools 4.0 '' package .",
    "unfortunately , the mean count rates are very low , _",
    "i.e. _ typically around @xmath20-@xmath21  hz and the observation frequency is less 1 `` run '' of 90 seconds per hour , making it difficult to get information about the source activity on time scales as short as one day .",
    "so data are binned in 5 week bins , yielding flux estimates with acceptable statistical errors .",
    "the light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_asm_bl ] . a pronounced luminosity increase during june 1997 followed by a slow decrease during the following 5 months can be recognized .",
    "hegra data were taken in july / august 1997 when the source was still active . in 1998 , bl  lacertae was in a low x - ray activity .",
    "note that egret was able to detect the source , and the tev instruments were not . intriguingly in the case of mkn 501 the opposite happened : the source was bright in the tev energy regime but could hardly be detected at mev / gev energies .",
    "model calculations by bttcher & bloom ( 1998 ) and madejski ( 1999 ) predict tev flux significantly higher than the upper limits obtained by hegra ( and also by cat at the same period ) .",
    "we explain the non - detection at vhe energies by two reasons .",
    "first , the absorption by a cib density as in fig .  [ fig_cirb ] reduces the observable flux by about 50% .",
    "secondly , the hegra measurements were taken roughly 10 days after the detection of the gev - flare .",
    "taking into account the strong variability observed in the two bl lac objects mkn 501 and mkn 421 , the vhe flux of bl lacertae could have easily decreased by a factor of @xmath25 in 10 days .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of 1es  2344 + 51.4 is shown in fig . [ fig_sed_2344 ] .",
    "this source was observed by the whipple group during the winter months of 1995/96 and 1996/97 ( catanese _ et al .",
    "whipple detected a flare on december 20@xmath22 1995 with a flux of 6.6@xmath23  ph  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( @xmath15 63% of the crab ) ; the mean flux ( excluding the flare emission ) during the first winter was estimated as 1.1@xmath24  ph  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( @xmath1511% of the crab ) . for the period 96 - 97",
    "an upper limit of 8.2@xmath25  ph  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( @xmath158% of the crab ) was reported ( all integral fluxes above 350  gev ) .",
    "the flux limit computed from the 1997/1998 hegra ct - system data is 2.9@xmath26  ph  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( @xmath13 1  tev ) .",
    "the smooth curve in the 2 - 10  kev band ( fig . [ fig_asm_2344 ] ) indicates that the source has been in a low and stable state for 1.5  years .",
    "the source was not monitored by the asm during the winter 1995/1996 , therefore , unfortunately , the 2 - 10 kev activity during the state of vhe - emission could not be examined .",
    "it is widely believed , that tev gamma - rays of bl  lac objects are produced by ultra - relativistic electrons , which emit synchrotron radiation in the kev band and produce the tev photons due to inverse compton scattering of soft target photons ( _ e.g. _ , ghisellini _",
    "the x - ray activity of a source gives crucial information about the presence of high energy electrons which could also produce tev radiation .",
    "a major uncertainty arises since the kev photons could either be synchrotron photons of very high energy electrons ( the actual energy of the electrons certainly depends on the value of the magnetic field ) or could be inverse compton photons produced by electrons with moderate energies . in the latter case , tev emission of the source would be less probable .",
    "the asm / rxte data provide a unique tool for monitoring the light curve of many x - bl  lac objects , but with a moderate sensitivity . in the case of mkn 501 , the state of increased activity lasted several months ( aharonian _ et al . _",
    "the asm data could be used to detect such a state by averaging the data over several days or weeks .",
    "such a large bining time does not allow us to search for short - term variability but is dictated by the low sensitivity of the detector .",
    "moreover , as for mkn  421 , the range 2 - 12  kev can be located around the `` pivot point '' of the synchrotron spectrum ( the hardening starts at the energy of the pivot point ) : it is not a completely safe indicator of activity , but it is certainly the best one available .",
    "whenever such a state was detected , observations could be initiated . such a strategy",
    "could be complemented with an alert - system which allows us to react to a flare detection in any chosen wavelength within several hours .",
    "[ fig_t_obs ] shows the observation time required to achieve a detection for sources with redshifts ranging from 0 . to 0.2 .",
    "the intrinsic emission is assumed to be 10% to 100% of @xmath27 ( assuming a slope of 2.6 ) or of @xmath28 ( with a slope of 3.6 , see section 3 ) .",
    "it can be recognized that , depending on the redshift of the source , observation times of several hours could suffice for a significant detection .",
    "detection for a flux ( before absorption by the cib ) of 10% , 20% , 50% or 100% of @xmath27 ( full line ) or of @xmath28 ( dashed line ) .",
    "features of the hegra 4 ct - system and an energy range of 0.5 - 3  tev have been assumed for the calculations ; the results are valid for observations with zenith angles below @xmath1520@xmath5.,width=340 ]",
    "in this paper we report upper limits for a sample of eight x - ray selected bl  lac objects and the object `` bl lacertae '' observed in 1997/1998 with the hegra ct - system .",
    "seven sources were studied with three telescopes during one to ten hours .",
    "the tev upper limits range from 15% to 65% of the crab flux .",
    "the conversion in units of @xmath11 s@xmath12 is done assuming the slope of the spectrum and a model of cib absorption .",
    "the sources bl  lacertae and 1es  2344 + 51.4 were observed with the 4-ct - system for approximately 15 h each .",
    "bl lacertae was flaring in july , 1997 in optical and soft gamma - ray .",
    "the source 1es  2344 + 51.4 is a very good vhe candidate due to its similarity to the well established strong tev sources mkn  421 and mkn  501 .",
    "our upper limits are at the level of @xmath1510% of the crab flux .",
    "the hegra iact system could detect tev sources out to a redshift of 0.15 . beyond this",
    ", intergalactic absorption is expected to reduce the @xmath2500  gev flux considerably .",
    "since bl lac sources are known to be very variable , a search for tev emission is much more promising when guided by observations in other wavelengths , especially by observations in the x - ray energy band .    the support of the german ministry for research and technology bmbf and of the spanish research council cicyt is gratefully acknowledged .",
