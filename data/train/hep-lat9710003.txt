    "we begin by iteratively smearing a copy of the links , ie .",
    "recursively smearing again the smeared links , with an ape type smearing process . in this study",
    "we use the method of @xcite in which links are averaged with connecting staples ; staples have weight @xmath3 , and the resulting link is reunitarized into su(n ) .",
    "we have found numerically that as we iterate this process there is a critical weight @xmath4 below which the configuration is cooled , ie .",
    "the average plaquette , moves closer and closer to the identity ; with a weight above @xmath4 smearing moves the links to a `` rough '' configuration with tr@xmath5 .",
    "the value of this critical weight seems to depend weakly on @xmath6 and volume : @xmath7 .",
    "this method of cooling however is _ equivariant _ : if starting configurations @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related by a gauge transformation @xmath10 , then the corresponding smeared configurations @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related by the same gauge transformation @xmath10 .",
    "this is useful since the smeared configuration is approaching the trivial orbit , where we know the unique landau gauge configuration .",
    "it is the configuration in which each link is constant and diagonal : @xmath13 such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the smeared polyakov loop in the @xmath16-direction ( made of @xmath17 links ) .",
    "we neglect here issues of degeneracy of eigenvalues , etc .",
    "thus if we smear extremely close to the trivial orbit , we can find a @xmath18 which rotates the smeared links @xmath19 to landau gauge uniquely , then apply this @xmath18 to the original links @xmath20 , producing a unique configuration @xmath21 ; due to the nonlinearity of non - abelian gauge transformations , it is neither diagonal nor satisfies the landau gauge condition in su(n ) theory .",
    "still it represents a unique starting point on the physical orbit , from which we can gauge fix to landau gauge and be assured of a unique solution .",
    "this is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "in our experiments we have found that it is not necessary to smear the links all the way to the trivial orbit ; after only a moderate amount of smearing , gauge fixing of the smeared links is unique .",
    "our view of this is captured below in an _",
    "artist s rendering _ of the change in @xmath22 as we smear .",
    "= 8.4 cm    [ fig2 ]    if the original configuration is smooth enough , the global maximum on the smeared orbit may lie in the basin of attraction of the ( gauge transformed ) global maximum on the physical orbit .",
    "when this happens , the preconditioning step of gauge fixing the smeared links to landau gauge leads to the final copy being the one of maximal @xmath23 , ie . the smoothest copy . if the original configuration is quite rough ( unphysically so )",
    ", there often is a mismatch between the global maxima of the smeared and original @xmath24 functions .",
    "the resulting configuration then does not have the globally maximal trace , although the trace is usually still rather high among the copies . in either event",
    "though , * gauge fixing ( to landau gauge ) is unique*.",
    "in the original form of this method , we should smear until we are within machine zero of the trivial orbit ( @xmath25 ) , however we have found that only partial smearing is necessary .",
    "the optimal parameters specifying this have emerged rather heuristically , and we will simply summarize them here and refer the reader to our more complete paper on this method of gauge fixing @xcite . also we have studied small lattices so far , up to @xmath26 , and we gauge fix to variations smaller that @xmath27 in @xmath24 .    the smearing coefficient @xmath3 , which is the weight given to the staples should be as large as possible , but below the critical value so that the smeared configuration is smoothed . we have found that @xmath28 works best , looking at how topological objects ( which slow the cooling ) are annihilated .",
    "the most important parameter is the number of smearing sweeps done .",
    "we have found that this depends on the number of topological objects in the configuration .",
    "thus smearing is pursued until the action falls below the one - instanton bound . on our @xmath29 lattices , we smeared until the average plaquette was within @xmath30 of * 1 * , which then leads to unique gauge fixing . in figure 3",
    "we show the cooling history of 6 lattices at a range of @xmath6 values .",
    "the plateaux show the stability of instanton pairs under smearing ( like under cooling ) .",
    "in figure 4 we display typical results on 100 random gauge transformations at 3 @xmath6 values : 2.0 ( top ) , 1.75 ( middle ) , and 1.5 ( bottom ) .",
    "the graphs contain histograms of the final value of @xmath24 on the gauge fixed copies obtained using local extremization , and the arrow shows the unique copy obtained with our method .",
    "* recursively smear a configuration @xmath20 into @xmath19 . *",
    "gauge fix @xmath19 by extremizing , @xmath31 , and apply the same gauge transformation to @xmath20 . * finally ,",
    "gauge fix @xmath20 as usual , by extremizing @xmath32 ."
