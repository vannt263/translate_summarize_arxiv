    "the idea of a quantum computing assisted medium access control ( mac ) protocol has been introduced by berces and imre  @xcite and van meter  @xcite .",
    "the protocol is building upon the concept of quantum entanglement .",
    "it controls the access to a wireless channel .",
    "it is assumed that the network consists of one access point ( ap ) and two client stations ( css ) , e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the ap is within communication range of both css .",
    "[ htbp ]    alternating ap and cs tss.,width=453 ]    the medium is synchronous .",
    "it consists of a sequence of equal size time slots ( tss ) .",
    "there are two types of alternating tss : ap and cs , see figure  [ fig : quantummac ] . only the ap is allowed to transmit in the ap ts . during each cs",
    "ts , only one cs is allowed to transmit .",
    "the right to transmit is determined by an entangled pair of qubits sent , by the ap to the css , during the preceding ap ts .",
    "every cs gets one part of a bell - einstein podolsky rosen ( bell - epr ) entangled qubit pair  @xcite .",
    "one qubit is given to client @xmath0 .",
    "the other is given to client @xmath1 .",
    "this is modeled by the following equation : @xmath2 the outcome resulting from the measurement of each qubit ( subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) can be either 0 or 1 .",
    "when qubit @xmath3 ( qubit @xmath4 ) is measured first , the result is random , with both outcomes being equally probable .",
    "then , when qubit @xmath4 ( qubit @xmath3 ) is measured , the outcome is the opposite of qubit @xmath3 s ( qubit @xmath4 s ) outcome .",
    "there is a correlation between what is resulting from the measurements of qubits @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "because they are entangled , when one qubit is measured by one of the css , the state of the qubit to be measured by the other cs is already determined .",
    "the cs that measures value one is allowed to send .",
    "the cs that measures value zero holds on . for balanced access by the two css ,",
    "the probability amplitude is set to @xmath5 in eq .",
    "[ eq : bellstate ] .",
    "arizmendi et al .",
    "@xcite also proposed an adaptation of quantum communication in a 802.11 mac protocol .",
    "they propose sending a combination of a bell - epr pair , to determine who transmits , and a w state entangled qubit triplet , to control the transmission .",
    "this proposal also only works for a two - cs network .",
    "this article addresses the question : * how can quantum computing assisted mac be extended to a network of an arbitrary number of css ? * we propose three solutions that extend the idea to a network consisting of an arbitrary number of css .",
    "all three quantum assisted mac protocols build upon the concept of quantum entanglement .",
    "they are all contention - free with collision avoidance ( ca ) .",
    "the first two protocols use the bell - epr pair and w state entanglement concepts .",
    "the _ w state _ is a model of multi - qubit entanglement  @xcite .",
    "it comprises two or several entangled qubits .",
    "the following equation models a three - bit entanglement case : @xmath6 upon the complementation of the measurement of the three qubits , one of the three collapses to value one while the two others collapse to value zero .",
    "it has been theorized that a w state can be generalized to @xmath7 qubits .",
    "thus , the quantum superposition has equal expansion coefficients of all possible pure states in which exactly one of the qubits is in an _ excited state _ @xmath8 , while all other ones are in the _ ground state _ @xmath9 , as in the equation : @xmath10    in this paper , we assume a network consisting of a single ap and @xmath7 css , where @xmath7 is a positive non - null integer .",
    "the css are denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "communications are ap - to - cs , and vice versa .",
    "there is a single multiple access channel .",
    "time is divided into equal - length tss . during each ts ,",
    "the ap or css may attempt the transmission of data . if no station transmits",
    ", then the ts is idle .",
    "if a single node attempts to transmit , then the transmission - attempt is a success . if several network nodes attempt to transmit during the same ts , there is a collision condition . to prevent collisions between the ap and css , the tss",
    "are either assigned to the ap or css . during an ap ts ,",
    "solely the ap is allowed to transmit . during a cs ts ,",
    "solely the css are allowed to transmit . to prevent collisions among the cs transmission - attempts ,",
    "a quantum computing - based mac protocol is followed .",
    "building upon the concept of quantum entanglement , we present three new such quantum computing - assited mac protocols , namely , the    * qubit distribution , * transmit first election and * temporal ordering protocols .",
    "all three protocols have a cyclic behavior .",
    "each cycle consists of a frame of one or several ap tss and one or several cs tss .",
    "all three protocols use ap tss to distribute entangled qubits to the css .",
    "the distribution of the qubits can be achieved using i ) pre - sharing , ii ) teleportation  @xcite or iii ) free space - transmission  @xcite .",
    "the ap ts may be used to send the classical bits of teleportation or for free space - transmission of qubits .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : timecycle4_cs ] shows the total number of tss that would be required if the round started with four css .",
    "a cycle is completed when all the css have had a chance to transmit . in the case of a one - cs networks , there are two tss and @xmath12 tss for an @xmath7-cs network , with @xmath7 greater than one .",
    "the ap needs to transmit the qubits in the ap ts , consecutively @xmath13 qubits , for a total of @xmath14 qubits in a complete cycle .",
    "if the ap has tasks that it needs to perform , such as forwarding packets , it does so in between cycles .",
    "this is also at that point that the ap reassesses the css that participate to the network .",
    "because each cs participating to the network gets a ts in every cycle , the protocol is fair .",
    "it is also collision free .",
    "the temporal ordering protocol leverages the concept of lehmer code and quantum oracle .",
    "a _ permutation _ of a set @xmath15 is a bijection @xmath16 from @xmath15 to itself .",
    "let @xmath17 be the elements of @xmath15 .",
    "a permutation is described as the @xmath7-tuple @xmath18 the number of different permutations of @xmath7 distinct elements is @xmath19 . in the sequel",
    ", we assume that the set @xmath15 consists of the numbers @xmath20 , i.e. , the cs identifiers .",
    "a permutation @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath21    a _ lehmer code _ is an encoding of a permutation @xmath16 of @xmath7 numbers @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "it is denoted as @xmath22 for @xmath23 , @xmath24 following item at position @xmath25 in the sequence , it is the number of items @xmath26 that are smaller than @xmath27 . by definition",
    ", @xmath28 is between zero and @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , let @xmath7 be equal to 3 and @xmath16 be equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding lehmer code is @xmath31 .    for @xmath32",
    ", the pair @xmath33 is called an _ inversion _ if @xmath25 is lower than @xmath34 but @xmath27 is greater than @xmath26 .",
    "an alternative interpretation of @xmath28 is the number of inversions for index @xmath25 .",
    "interestingly , the sum of inversions in @xmath16 , that is @xmath35 , is the number of transpositions needed to transform an identity permutation into @xmath16 .",
    "we now explain decoding of a lehmer code @xmath36 into a permutation @xmath37 . for @xmath25",
    "equal to @xmath7 down to one , @xmath27 is initialized to @xmath28 .",
    "do for @xmath34 in the range @xmath38 , if @xmath26 is greater than or equal to @xmath27 , then add one to @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting @xmath7-tuple @xmath37 is a permutation of @xmath39 .",
    "adding one unit to each element translates the @xmath7-tuple into a permutation of @xmath40 .",
    "for instance , lehmer code @xmath31 is successively decoded as @xmath41 and finally @xmath42 .",
    "another interesting property is that the lehmer code of a permutation @xmath16 corresponds to its lexical order position in the list of @xmath19 possible permutations of @xmath20 .",
    "note that the first position has number zero and last position has number @xmath43 .",
    "an integer @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 can be mapped to the lehmer code at lexical position @xmath44 using the _ factoradic system _",
    "let us define @xmath46 the corresponding lehmer code is @xmath36 , where @xmath47      an _ oracle _ is a boolean function that maps a @xmath48-bit boolean input to a @xmath49-bit output .",
    "an oracle can be transformed to a quantum oracle .",
    "the input and output of the corresponding _ quantum oracle _ are both @xmath50-bit long .",
    "the computational model is as follows .",
    "there is a @xmath48-qubit input register , denoted as @xmath51 .",
    "the oracle output is represented as function @xmath52 , with corresponding unitary transformation @xmath53 .",
    "a @xmath49-qubit register is used to represent @xmath52 .",
    "the transformation @xmath53 is applied to the computational basis @xmath54 as follows : @xmath55 the operator @xmath56 denotes modulo - two bitwise addition .",
    "the input - output quregister is initialized as the superposition : @xmath57    the term @xmath58 denotes the tensor product of @xmath48 hadamard matrices , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "our quantum oracle is a function @xmath60 that maps @xmath44 in @xmath61 to a permutation @xmath37 of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a non - null positive integer , corresponding to the number of css participating to a network .",
    "let @xmath44 be an integer in the range @xmath62 .",
    "function @xmath60 proceeds according to the method described in section  [ sec : lehmercode ] .",
    "firstly , using the factoradic system the integer @xmath44 is mapped to a lehmer code .",
    "secondly , the lehmer code is decoded into a permutation @xmath37 of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath63 be largest power of two , such that @xmath64 is smaller than or equal to @xmath19 . in equation  [ eq : transformation ] , the subscript @xmath48 is set to @xmath65 .",
    "the subscript @xmath49 is set to @xmath66 .",
    "the general format of the quantum oracle s output is @xmath67",
    "let @xmath68 denote @xmath7 groups of @xmath69 rightmost qubits in the output register .",
    "for @xmath25 in @xmath70 , the qubits @xmath27 are dispatched to client @xmath71 .",
    "client @xmath71 measures the qubits in group @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding numerical value is the index of the ts allocated to @xmath71 . in the end",
    ", once all the css have measured their corresponding qubits , each of them get a value from the very same permutation .",
    "in other words , from all the @xmath64 superpositions , all the css _ partly observe _ exactly the same permutation .",
    "note that the system state may not collapse in every possible permutation of @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the quantum oracle s input register solely contains the superpositions in the range @xmath72 , which is lower than or equal to @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the ordering of the css is not fairly distributed .      in the _",
    "temporal ordering protocol _",
    ", the frame format is as in figure  [ fig : quantummac ] .",
    "the tss are alternatively assigned to the ap then to the css .",
    "for each cs ts , the protocol distributes @xmath66 entangled qubits to the css . for each cs ts",
    ", each cs receives @xmath69 qubits .",
    "there is a slot index @xmath25 visible to all css .",
    "it is initialized to zero and incremented modulo the number of stations ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this operation randomizes the access and mitigates the unfairness due to the fact that not every possible permutation of @xmath7 is generated , see the fairness analysis in section  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "the arrivals of packets in each cs are backlogged and stored in a fifo queue .",
    "when its fifo queue is not empty , a cs is ready to transmit . at the beginning of each cs ts , every ready cs measures the @xmath69 qubits it has received for this ts .",
    "the binary value resulting from the measurement determines an order among all the ready to transmit css .",
    "let @xmath73 be a short delay , with @xmath74 slot time .",
    "let @xmath48 be the binary value measured by a cs .",
    "the cs waits for a delay @xmath75 from the beginning of the ts .",
    "if the medium is sensed idle after the wait , then the cs transmits .",
    "otherwise , it waits until the next cs ts and tries again .",
    "+   +   +      using simulation , we compare the normalized throughput versus the offered load for the temporal ordering protocol and aloha protocol .",
    "we assume that the packets are of constant size , network is single data rate and packet arrival is @xmath76 packets per second ( @xmath77 ) . because of the first and second assumptions , the packet transmission time is constant .",
    "let @xmath78 denote the packet transmission time , in seconds per packet .",
    "the network _ offered load _ is the product @xmath79 erlangs .",
    "the network _ normalized throughput _ ( @xmath80 ) reflects the offered load and rate of successfully transmitted packets .",
    "a successfully transmitted packet is a packet not involved in a collision .",

    "figure  [ fig : qmac_vs_aloha ] shows the performance of the temporal ordering protocol versus the aloha protocol . the aloha s performance is consistent with the original analysis of kleinrock and tobagi  @xcite .",
