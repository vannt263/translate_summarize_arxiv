    "we start our study by describing the formal approach to non - locality that will be used throughout this work , which is similar to the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used by spagnolo _",
    ".  @xcite . in our thought experiment ,",
    "the spin of the discrete - variable component of the system is probed along a direction @xmath3 of the bloch sphere by the bi - dimensional operator @xmath4 with @xmath5 the @xmath6-pauli operator . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , non - locality of the state of a cv system can be tested in the phase - space by using the dichotomic parity operator @xmath7 acted upon by the displacement @xmath8 $ ] ( @xmath9 )  @xcite so as to form the displaced parity operator @xmath10 . here , @xmath11 is the bosonic operator number of the harmonic oscillator whose annihilation ( creation ) operators is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is a fock state with @xmath15 excitations .",
    "the key point of such phase - space approach is that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the wigner function associated with the state over which the expectation value of @xmath18 is calculated .",
    "therefore , we can easily construct the correlation function @xmath19 from which we get the bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) function @xmath20 local realistic theories impose the bound @xmath21 , which is violated by quantum mechanics , although not maximally , when state @xmath22 is used and a judicious choice of the set of parameters @xmath23 is made  @xcite .",
    "this form of the bell - chsh test has been shown to be effective in revealing the non - local nature of correlations in a state such as @xmath22  @xcite ( see also spagnolo _ et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and we thus believe it is a very appropriate tool for the understanding of the role that the interaction with an environment has on the non - local properties of such state .    first , we set a benchmark by briefly addressing the case of a markovian dynamics as encompassed by general amplitude damping ( ad ) and phase damping ( pd ) processes , both for the spin and the cv subsystem  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the dimensionality of the system at hand , both cases are most effectively tackled by means of the operator - sum representation of a quantum channel .",
    "we call @xmath24 the set of kraus operators specifying the non - unitary process @xmath25 , so that the evolved state at time @xmath26 takes the general form @xmath27 .",
    "the explicit kraus operators for ad and pd and the form of the correlation functions corresponding to the case where the spin or cv components are influenced by the environment are provided in appendix  a. here , it is enough to study the behavior of the numerically optimized bell function @xmath28 for the superposition state , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ adpd ] against the probability @xmath29 of occurrence of the channel ( introduced in appendix  a ) .",
    "while , expectedly , affecting the cv with an ad channel results in a quicker decay of the bell function as compared to the spin - affected scenario , phase damping seems to be oblivious to the dimensionality of the subsystem being influenced by the environment .",
    "this is likely to be due to the fact that , as @xmath30 gets sufficiently large , @xmath31 and the cv state is effectively encoded in the fictitious quasi - qubit @xmath32 and the pd channel in the spin and cv - affected scenario give very similar outcomes .",
    "needless to say , as the ad mechanism depends critically on the number of excitations in the parties entering a given state , such homogenization does not take place in fig .",

    "our aim is now to study non - markovian dynamics , looking for evidence of information kick - back over the evolution of the hybrid system at hand .",
    "we start by analyzing the cv - affected case and consider the harmonic oscillator ( with frequency @xmath37 ) as coupled to an @xmath38-mode bosonic environment according to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the coupling rate between the @xmath41 mode and the cv subsystem and @xmath42 is a dimensionless coupling strength and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the position - like quadrature of the harmonic oscillator ( the @xmath41 mode of the environment ) .",
    "this model is known to give rise to quantum brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "the effective evolution of the cv subsystem is thus regulated by the time - local me @xmath45{+}{\\cal l}_{bm}(\\rho_{o}),\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the density matrix of subsystem @xmath47 and @xmath48{+}\\xi(t)[\\hat q,[\\hat p,\\cdot]]\\\\ & { -}i\\gamma(t)[\\hat q,\\{\\hat p,\\cdot\\}]{+}\\frac{ir(t)}{2}[\\hat q^2,\\cdot ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that accounts for diffusion [ at rates @xmath49 and @xmath50 , damping [ at rate @xmath51 and the renormalization of the frequency of the cv subsystem .",
    "we have introduced the bosonic momentum - like quadrature @xmath52 of the @xmath47 subsystem . the derivation of eq .",
    "does not require the rotating - wave approximation nor it invokes the born - markov one .",

    "[ mkfigure ] shows @xmath33 as a function of @xmath81 in two different dynamical regimes . for a large number of environmental mode - frequencies ( _ i.e. _ for a large cutoff @xmath53 ) and a relatively large coupling strength , the numerically optimized bell function shows a monotonically decreasing behavior that makes us lose evidences of non - local character of the superposition state very soon in time .",
    "although by lowering @xmath42 we observe some very partial revival of @xmath33 due to a kick - back of coherence into the spin - cv system , this is not sufficient to give rise to violate the local - realistic bound again .",
    "the trend changes dramatically for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which bring us to the phase of `` non - markovian revivals '' : @xmath33 becomes a periodic function of time and shows slowly - fading peaks at which the hybrid bell - chsh inequality studied here is quite largely violated .",
    "such oscillations , which are typical of non - markovian dynamics , are related to the appearance of temporal regions where @xmath49 achieves negative values and are connected to the memory of the environmental system , which keeps track of the system s state and feeds this information back to it .    the connection between non - markovian revivals of non - locality and the memory properties of the environmental system appears to be reinforced by the study of a simple model for system - environment interaction .",
    "we now consider the spin - part @xmath84 of the superposition state as coupled to a star - like collection of @xmath85 non - interacting spin-@xmath1 particles via the energy - preserving longitudinal ising model @xmath86 [ @xmath87 is the @xmath88-pauli operator of the @xmath89 environmental spin and @xmath90 is the corresponding coupling strength ] . the evolution induced by @xmath91 over @xmath84 is exactly solvable due to its excitation - preserving , non - interacting nature .",

    "the oscillatory function of time appearing in @xmath100 immediately reveals the non - monotonic behavior that the corresponding bell - chsh function will exhibit , thus signalling non - markovianity .",
    "clearly , at @xmath101 , the decoherence factor @xmath102^{n_s}$ ] becomes ineffective , regardless of the number of environmental spins , and the correlation function achieves the value corresponding to a pure qubit - oscillator superposition state .",
    "therefore , the non - markovian non - locality revivals are full and the only effect of a growing size of the star is the narrowing of the revival peaks  @xcite .",
    "this results in shorter time windows where the bell - chsh inequality is violated .",
    "this analysis is displayed in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ spinbath ] * ( a ) * , where we assess the case of three different values of @xmath85 .",
    "an interesting remark is due , now , in relation to the aims of our study .",
    "this spin model for decoherence is known to provide a divergent value of the non - markovian measure proposed by breuer _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite [ which is unbounded ] .",
    "this means that the dynamics experienced by @xmath84 can never be described by a markovian model .",
    "the model , in fact , is such that the trace distance of equatorially antipodal states of @xmath84 ( upon which the measure in  @xcite is built ) is given exactly by @xmath103 .",
    "this is clearly shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ spinbath ] * ( a)*. therefore , not only the non - markovian revivals of non - locality persist in time due to the infinitely non - markovian nature of the evolution , but their occurrence is clearly related to the changes in the trace distance , thus providing a clear connection between the kick - back of information from the star system to @xmath84 and the revived non - local features of @xmath22 .    * ( a ) * +     however , one should be careful in dealing with the relationship between non - markovianity and non - locality , due to the multifaceted nature of the former statistical phenomenon : it would be a mistake to identify an in - principle non - markovian dynamics with the occurrence of non - monotonic trends in @xmath33 .",
    "we illustrate such point considering an important instance of post - markovian dynamics proposed by shabani and lidar in  @xcite .",
    "the model includes explicitly a memory kernel @xmath104 that renders the me time non - local as @xmath105 where @xmath106 $ ] is the standard markovian liouvillian describing dissipation at rate @xmath107 induced by a thermal bath with mean occupation number @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the widely used form of the memory kernel @xmath109 , a choice that guarantees complete positivity of the map for any value of @xmath110 and at any instant of time  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in eq .   can be straightforwardly solved using a rather technical approach discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of providing a self - contined presentation , we summarize the steps needed for such a derivation in appendix",
    "b. we eventually get an analytic form of the density matrix of the evolved superposition state and , thus , the correlation function , whose expression is however too cumbersome to be reported here .",
    "[ spinbath ] * ( b ) * shows the results of our quantitative study : we display the optimized bell - chsh function against the dimensionless interaction time @xmath111 and for a long / short environmental memory time as compared to the dissipation time @xmath112 . when @xmath113 , the environment has a long - time memory , thus pushing the dynamics away from markovianity .",
    "interestingly , this results in larger temporal windows where the violation of the bell inequality is observed .",
    "viceversa , for a larger @xmath114 , such window becomes shorter and the dynamics gets closer to a markovian one .",
    "the resilience induced by a memory - keeping evolution turns out to be quite spectacular when studied against the thermal nature of the environment .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ spinbath ] * ( b ) * , while for @xmath115 it is enough to have @xmath116 to stop violating the bell - chsh inequality , a small raise to @xmath117 is enough to push the value of @xmath108 at which @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "it is remarkable , though , that besides such induced robustness , no otherwise evident signature of non - markovianity ( such as the ripples highlighted previously and typically exhibited by other indicators of quantumness  @xcite ) can be deduced from the analysis of the correlation function @xmath100 associated with this case and of fig .",
    "[ spinbath ] * ( b)*. we believe that the reason for such a behavior , though , should be researched in the multifaceted nature of non - markovian dynamics.in fact , the shabani - lidar me can be recast into the form of a time - dependent , time - local me whose coefficients are not all positive , therefore signaling the break - down of divisibility  @xcite and thus the impossibility to describe the evolution in markovian terms , according to the criterion put forward by rivas _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , although no kick - back of information is possible ( as witnessed by the fact that the measure proposed in  @xcite is strictly null , for such a dynamical map ) .",
    "it is just intriguing that the bell - chsh function is able to _ experience _ the subtleties of such differences in such a striking way .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the bell - chsh function for a spin - oscillator superposition state under the influences of two models for non - markovian dynamics , demonstrating the emergence of interesting features related to the various facets with which non - markovianity manifests itself .",
    "care should be used in assessing them by means of diverse non - classicality indicators , as they may turn up to give mutually inconsistent evidences .",
    "we have shown that the bell - chsh function is particularly sensitive to the subtleties of a dynamics that , although does not appear to be characterized by a kick - back of information from the environment , is nevertheless not divisible and as such far from being markovian .",
    "it will be interesting to address similar questions in models for open - system dynamics specific of condensed matter set - ups , such as the @xmath120 noise that is expected to provide strong non - markovian dynamical features .",

    "<S> non - markovian evolutions are responsible for a wide variety of physically interesting effects . here , we study non - locality of the non - classical state of a system consisting of a qubit and an oscillator exposed to the effects of non - markovian evolutions . we find that the different facets of non - markovianity affect non - locality in different and non - obvious ways , ranging from pronounced insensitivity of the bell function to quite a spectacular evidence of information kick - back .    in 1935 , e. schrdinger formulated a thought experiment addressing some paradoxical implications of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics when pushed to the realm of everyday experience  @xcite . by describing a situation where the degrees of freedom of a ` large ' object are correlated in a quantum mechanical way to a ` small ' quantum system , </S>",
    "<S> the paradox by schrdinger ( commonly referred to as the ` cat paradox ' ) embodies a genuine example of the possibility to enforce quantum features beyond the microscopic domain . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding its almost octogenarian history , the cat paradox still defies a full understanding of its implications  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the steady - pace experimental progresses in quantum control achieved in the last twenty years have been able to produce instances very close to the original formulation by schrdinger and are expected to help significantly in the grasping of fundamental concepts such as the quantum - to - classical transition , as well as the development of quantum technological applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> states having the form @xmath0 are the energy eigenstates of a spin-@xmath1 particle ( a qubit ) and @xmath2 are opposite - phase coherent states of a harmonic oscillator  @xcite , are faithful instances of the situations envisaged in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and have been demonstrated in trapped - ion settings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are accessible ( or close to be such ) in other experimental contexts involving the effective interaction between spin - like systems and mechanical oscillators  @xcite or the all - optical generation of micro - macro states  @xcite . in the first instance , one would consider effective two - level systems ( such as neutral or artificial atoms ) embedded in cavities endowed with movable light mirrors ( embodying the continuous variable ( cv ) subsystem ) . in the second one , </S>",
    "<S> the spin and cv parts are provided by different degrees of freedom of two distinct photonic information carriers . </S>",
    "<S> both settings are able to engineer states having the form of eq .   and both allow for the reconstruction of the wigner function of the cv subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> as it will be seen in the next section , such ability is crucial to the assessment of the bell test at the core of our investigation . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the multifaceted interests in studying quantum superposition states analogous to eq .   extend up to the assessment of environment - induced dynamical effects and their implications for the settlement , manipulation and protection of general quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this is even more relevant when non - trivial environmental influences of a non - markovian nature , such as those due to lack of divisibility dynamics and/or memory - keeping and feedback - inducing system - environment mechanisms are considered  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the working principles of such processes are still largely unexplored and are expected to be relevant in condensed matter set - ups involving artificial spins and mechanical modes . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental handiness of such states and the possibility to mimic the effects of non - trivial , memory - keeping environments in fully controllable linear - optics test - beds  @xcite , make up for the possibility to acquire knowledge on the _ true _ behavior of the quantum features of state  , when exposed to physical non - markovian dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these arguments , in this paper we address the influences that non - markovian dynamics giving rise to non - divisible maps have on the non - local nature of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ state ] ) by studying two different configurations . </S>",
    "<S> first , we analyze the effects imparted by a spring - like coupling between the cv part of our state and an ensemble of quantum harmonic oscillators modelling quantum brownian motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then move to an effective post - markovian dynamics of the spin - part only , as modelled by the master equation ( me ) proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and analyzed , for a single - qubit problem in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evident signatures of non - markovianity have been found in the trend of entanglement and discord  @xcite for an initially quantum - correlated state of two harmonic oscillators  @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> not only we analyze a different figure of merit and form of quantum correlations , but we also address a radically different clas of states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the behavior of the bell function associated with a brownian motion - affected superposition state of a qubit and an oscillator shows quite subtle features . </S>",
    "<S> first , brownian motion affects the non - local nature of such state in quite a significant way when the cut - off frequency of the brownian bath is much smaller than the natural oscillation frequency of the cv subsystem , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ in the regime that would correspond to a strong non - markovian limit : large - amplitude revival peaks are found , showing the kick - back mechanism that the memory - keeping environment can exert over the system . </S>",
    "<S> second , the post - markovian me turns out to be unable to induce a non - monotonic decay of the bell function . yet , </S>",
    "<S> such dynamics is nondivisible , as it is straightforward to check , and as such it deviates from the prescriptions commonly accepted for markovianity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is revealed as fully non - markovian by the measure recently proposed by rivas et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , our study provides indirect evidence that the evolution of nonlocality in a quantum superposition state of a qubit and an oscillator is qualitatively similar to what would arise from the measure proposed by breuer et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is designed to point towards the back - flow of information from the environment to the system .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ uno ] we describe the formal tools that will be used in the core part of our analysis and discuss , very briefly , the case of markovian evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> this will be used as a milestone for the comparisons with the explicitly non - markovian cases . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ due ] , of the other hand , we present the key part of our study and address non - locality in a quantum superposition state of a qubit and an oscillator under non - markovian dynamical conditions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ conc ] is for our conclusions and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> we delegate the most technical parts of our work to two appendices . </S>"
