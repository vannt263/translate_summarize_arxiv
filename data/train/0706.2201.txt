    "inspired in multifractals , tsallis proposed a generalization of boltzmann - gibbs entropy ( @xmath1 )  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the entropic parameter for a specific system and is connected to its dynamics as recently proposed  @xcite , @xmath3 are the probabilities satisfying @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a constant , and @xmath6 .",
    "this entropy for a system composed of two independent parts @xmath7 and @xmath8 , such as the probability is given by @xmath9 , has the interesting property of nonextensivity ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath10 besides representing a generalization , @xmath11 , like @xmath1 , is nonnegative , concave , lesche - stable ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "recently it has been shown that it is also _ extensive _ for some sorts of correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "tsallis statistics , or nonextensive statistics , attempt to handle some anomalies that appear in physical problems which can not be treated with boltzmann - gibbs ( @xmath13 ) statistics , for instance , long - range correlations , intrinsic cooperativity , multifractal structure , dissipation in mesoscopic scale , strong non - markovian microscopic memory , etc  @xcite .",
    "these anomalies have the common characteristic of presenting power - laws , instead of the ordinary exponential - laws , which is also a characteristic of some complex systems .",
    "its applicability ranges from protein folding  @xcite to financial markets  @xcite , and from turbulence  @xcite to cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "for example , in condensed matter problems we can cite ising ferromagnets , landau diamagnetism , electron - phonon systems , tight - binding - like hamiltonians , metallic and superconductor systems  @xcite . in adittion ,",
    "an interesting example is in  @xcite where the authors could predict some peculiar magnetic properties of manganites using nonextensive statistics like nanoscale inhomogeneity and phase coexistence , fractal structures , and long - range interactions  @xcite .    herein , we present some results comparing an inhomogeneous spin system within @xmath13 framework and a homogeneous spin system into a nonextensive approach .",
    "this comparison lead us to a connection between the nonextensive parameter @xmath0 with specific moments of the distribution of the exchange integral of the inhomogeneous system .",
    "thus , the spin waves in a inhomogeneous magnetic media can be described by the nonextensive statistics and the entropic parameter is connected to the microscopic properties of the system , as previously shown for other systems by beck @xcite , beck and cohen @xcite , wilk and wodarczyk @xcite , reis et al .",
    "@xcite , and therefore can be seen as a measurement of its complexity .",
    "in a ferromagnet at @xmath14k all the spins have the maximum projection @xmath15 along the @xmath16 direction ; this is the ground state configuration  @xcite . letting the spin system be in thermal contact with a reservoir , as the temperature increases",
    ", it will leave its ground state , the projections along the quantization direction will be reduced , and a wave - like perturbation will flow through the spin system ; that is the spin - wave ( magnons ) . the spin - wave theory leads to the description of the magnetism of ferromagnets at low temperatures , in the regime where the total angular momentum is close to its the projection along the @xmath16 direction , @xmath17 .",
    "we will consider a system of @xmath18 spins , each one interacting with @xmath16 neighbors in a inhomogeneous way , and in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian for this inhomogeneous magnetic system is given by  @xcite @xmath20 in which @xmath21 ( always ferromagnetic ) describes the inhomogeneity of the media , i.e. , there is a distribution of exchange interactions @xmath22 , and @xmath23 plays the role of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the whole hamiltonian can be re - written in terms of the collective motion operators in order to give us the magnetization per unit of volume .",
    "one can write the spin operators as @xmath24 + s_{{\\bf r}z}s_{{\\bf r+d}z}.\\ ] ]    the holstein - primakoff transformation of spin operators , at low temperatures , is given by @xmath25 in which @xmath26 and @xmath27 obey the commutation relation @xmath28 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the operators @xmath27 and @xmath26 can be written in terms of the collective motion of the system @xmath29 in which @xmath30=1 $ ] .",
    "thus , one can rewrite the exchange term of the hamiltonian ( [ eq.02 ] ) @xmath31-\\sum_{\\bf r , d}j_{d}({\\bf r})\\,s_{{\\bf r}z}s_{{\\bf ( r+d)}z}.\\ ] ]    using the low - temperature holstein - primakoff transformation , in terms of the collective motion operators , we have    @xmath32= \\sum_{k}\\,\\left(\\frac{2\\,s}{n}\\sum_{\\bf r,\\,d}j_{d}({\\bf r})\\cos({\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf d})\\right)\\,b_{k}^{+}\\,b_{k}\\ ] ]    and @xmath33 note that we have excluded the magnon - magnon interaction , represented by the term of @xmath34 .    in terms of these operators , @xmath35 where @xmath15 is the spin value per site and therefore the second term of the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath36    where @xmath18 is the number of sites .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the boson number operator and @xmath39 .",
    "the first two terms represent the fundamental state of the system , or the total energy without excitations .",
    "the term that describes the magnons is the second one .",
    "it has the form @xmath40 and gives the dispersion relation for this inhomogeneous magnetic system @xmath41    for large wave length , one may write    @xmath42\\ ] ]    and @xmath43 , being @xmath44 the lattice parameter .",
    "thus , the dispersion relation is    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the stiffness parameter and @xmath16 is the number of first neighbors .",
    "since the interaction varies between spins , one may consider that it has a distribution @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the average magnetization varies with respect to the saturation value of the magnetization and its variation is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the planck distribution .",
    "then , ( [ eq.15 ] ) becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 .    for @xmath51 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath52 , the inner integral becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the volume magnetization variation due to the magnon excitation of a inhomogeneous is then given by @xmath55    it is important to emphasize that the volume magnetization change of the inhomogeneous system has a @xmath56 dependence ( like the homogenous case ) and also depends on the @xmath57 moment of the distribution of exchange integrals @xmath58 .",
    "this exponent is expected since 3 is related to the dimension of the system and 2 refer to the dynamics , i.e. , came from the dispersion relation ( [ eq.14 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of a system is given by its hamiltonian @xmath59 and the wave number @xmath5 , defined by @xmath59 , is , consequently , related to the dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the statistics of a system is given by an average over a great number of variables ; and lies , for instance , in the number of bosons @xmath60 for each wave number @xmath5 .",
    "this average over weighted states makes it possible to obtain the relation of microscopic physical properties and macroscopic thermodynamic quantities such as the volume magnetization variation .",
    "the nonextensive approach proposes a change on the statistics of the system , not on its dynamics .",
    "thus , we assume an equivalent hamiltonian as ( [ eq.02 ] ) , but homogeneous in this framework , i.e. , the exchange integral can be taken out of the sum .",
    "the dispersion relation is therefore given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the exchange integral of this homogeneous system .",
    "the volume magnetization in this nonextensive scenario can be written as  @xcite @xmath63 in which @xmath38 is the boson number operator and @xmath64 is not the standard planck distribution , but its @xmath0-version , i.e. , generalized plank distribution @xmath65^{\\frac{q}{1-q } } } { \\sum_{n_{k}=0}^{\\infty}[1-(1-q)(\\beta\\,n_{k}\\,\\epsilon_{k})]^{\\frac{q}{1-q}}}.\\ ] ]    using the dispersion relation described above and making ( [ eq.20 ] ) dimensionless , one gets @xmath66 where @xmath67^{\\frac{q}{1-q } } } { \\sum_{n_{k}=0}^{\\infty}[1-(1-q)(x\\,n_{k})]^{\\frac{q}{1-q}}}.\\ ] ]    finally , the magnetization can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the integral which appears in eq.([eq.22 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the magnetization in this scenario has the same @xmath56 behavior as in ( [ eq.19 ] ) .",
    "it is a consequence that neither the dynamics ( @xmath70 ) nor the dimension ( @xmath71 ) have being changed .",
    "all the information about the homogeneity and/or inhomogeneity of the system is into the statistics and , consequently , into the coefficient of the magnetization change .",
    "an analytical connection between the entropic parameter @xmath0 and the volume magnetization variation can be obtained at the limit @xmath72 . at this limit ,",
    "we can write ( [ eq.22 ] ) as @xmath73    thus the volume magnetization change is now given by @xmath74\\ ] ] in which @xmath75 and @xmath76 are dimensionless integrals @xmath77\\ , \\left[1+\\frac{(q-1)}{2}\\,x^2\\,\\frac{\\left[e^{q\\,x}+1\\right]}{\\left[e^{q\\,x}-1\\right]^2}\\right ] } = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\,\\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)- 5.2277\\,(q-1)\\ ] ] and @xmath78 \\,x^{5/2}\\,dx}{\\left[e^{q\\,x}-1\\right]^3\\,\\left[1+\\frac{(q-1)}{2}\\,x^2\\,\\frac{\\left[e^{q\\,x}+1\\right ] } { \\left[e^{q\\,x}-1\\right]^2}\\right ] } = 16.4154 - 68.6515\\,(q-1).\\ ] ]    as it is an approximation for @xmath0 close to 1 , there is no necessity of terms higher than @xmath79 , so the second term of @xmath76 can be neglected .",
    "thus , @xmath80.\\ ] ]    one can see that , in this approximation , the magnetization is directly related to the entropic index and when @xmath81 , it recovers the usual result ( homogeneous case within bg statistics ) .",
    "let us consider that the two systems discussed before have the same critical temperature , as already done in the literature  @xcite . considering the hamiltonian ( [ eq.02 ] ) for an inhomogeneous magnetic system within the mean field approximation ,",
    "one may change the quantum operator @xmath82 for its thermal average @xmath83 .",
    "thus , considering @xmath16 first neighbors of an atom on the @xmath84 site of the lattice , its hamiltonian becomes @xmath85 where in this approximation we can consider the exchange interaction between the spins as an average value @xmath86 .",
    "it is reasonable , because all of the spins , in the mean field approximation , interacts with all others spins in the same way .    for the above hamiltonian",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the critical temperature @xmath87    an analogous calculation can be done in the nonextensive scenario @xcite",
    ". the generalized brillouin function  @xcite gives us the critical temperature @xmath88 in which @xmath62 is the exchange integral in this framework .",
    "the relation between these two temperatures is given by @xcite @xmath89    thus , using ( [ eq.31 ] ) , ( [ eq.32 ] ) and ( [ eq.33 ] ) one find the relation between the two exchange integrals @xmath90 that is , the exchange integral in nonextensive framework is equivalent to and average of the inhomogeneous one .",
    "this result is expected since , as already discussed above , we are not changing the dynamics of the system , but only but only the statistical treatment , which is used to calculate its thermodynamical properties .",
    "comparing the magnetization change per unit of volume in the inhomogeneous framework ( [ eq.20 ] ) with its analogous in the nonextensive scenario ( [ eq.24 ] ) , one finds that @xmath91    the above equation is a relation of the @xmath0 parameter and moments of the exchange interaction distribution @xmath22 .",
    "figure ( [ figura ] ) presents the expression above numerically solved for @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "this procedure comparing the magnetization was already been done  @xcite , where those authors have found similar results inspired in superstatistics  @xcite .     is connected to specific moments of the distribution of exchange integrals .",
    "this result is valid for any @xmath22 and shows that the entropic parameter is connected to the physical properties of the system . ]",
    "an analytical connection between the entropic parameter @xmath0 and the specific moments of the exchange integral of the inhomogeneous magnetic media can be obtained using the expression for the volume magnetization change in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "comparing the ( [ eq.20 ] ) and ( [ eq.27 ] ) one gets @xmath93 or @xmath94.\\ ] ]    the result above is also valid for any @xmath22 and shows that the entropic parameter is connected to the physical properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "summarizing , in the present work we have shown that the @xmath0 parameter can be seen as a measurement of the inhomogeneity of a magnetic system .",
    "it ratifies previous works  @xcite in which , inspired in superstatistics  @xcite , the entropic parameter @xmath0 was related to the first and second moments of the distribution of magnetic moments of manganites @xmath95 and was also experimentally verified .",
    "thus , the present work corroborates the idea that changing the usual boltzmann@xmath96gibbs statistics to one that is able to describe power - laws ( tsallis statistics ) , one can characterize systems that has special features like inhomogeneities ; nonextensivity is therefore a key role to describe complex systems .",
