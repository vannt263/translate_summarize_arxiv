    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is our most successful physical theory , encompassing phenomena as diverse as chemical bonding , the band structure of solids , and the standard model of particle physics .",
    "but the probabilistic aspect of quantum mechanics has been a source of unease from the outset . as surveyed by home [ 1 ] , the founding fathers were divided over this aspect of the theory that they had created : bohr , born , and heisenberg were comfortable with the probabilistic structure of quantum theory , whereas einstein and schrdinger had profound reservations . this unease , and division , have continued to the present .",
    "let us begin with a review of the postulates of qm , in the arena of a complex hilbert space , following for the larger part the presentation of ballentine [ 2 ] .",
    "while everyone agrees that the above postulates provide a practical set of rules for making predictions in quantum mechanics , and that these predictions to date have always agreed with experiment , there is a dichotomy when it comes to giving an interpretive framework for the rules .    * on the one hand , we have the `` orthodox '' interpretation , as given , for example , in the text of mandl [ 4 ] .",
    "this asserts that the state @xmath22 gives a complete description of an _ individual _ system , and that ( 14 ) corresponds to `` reduction '' of the individual s state vector .",
    "* on the other hand , we have the `` statistical '' interpretation , as discuused , for example , in the review of ballentine [ 2 ] , according to which the state @xmath23 describes certain statistical properties of an _ ensemble _ of similarly prepared systems . according to this interpretation , ( 14 )",
    "corresponds to the preparation of a new ensemble by a measurement .",
    "there _ may _ be , or there _ may not _",
    "be , hidden variables that specify a complete , nonstatistical interpretation of individual systems : the statistical interpretation is agnostic with respct to this issue .",
    "to see why the `` r '' operation is needed , let us demonstrate that the measurement process can not be represented by a _",
    ", _ unitary _ evolution on a closed system .",
    "let us consider a stern - gerlach experiment , in which an initial spin eigenstate @xmath22 with eigenvalue @xmath24 along the @xmath25 axis is separated , by means of a magnetic field that is inhomogeneous along the @xmath26 axis , into orthonormal states @xmath27 that have respective spin eigenvalues @xmath28 along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "thus , at the detector one sees either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , with @xmath31 let us suppose that these final states evolved from the initial state by the deterministic unitary `` u''process , which would imply that @xmath32 which is a contradiction .",
    "hence , the measurement process , in which an initial coherent superposition of states leads to a definite but unpredictable outcome , can not be described by a deterministic unitary time evolution .",
    "thus measurement involves a physical process , which we have called the `` r '' process , that is distinct from the deterministic unitary `` u '' process that governs the unobserved evolution of the quantum system .",
    "however , the `` r '' process does not have to be nonunitary ; one can have for the @xmath33th atom going through the apparatus the evolution @xmath34 a unitary evolution that is different for each @xmath33 .",
    "this is possible because any path through hilbert space connecting two normalized pure states can be described by a succession of infinitesimal unitary transformations . to prove this",
    ", it suffices to consider the infinitesimal segment @xmath35 . if we take @xmath36 up to an error of second order , and @xmath37 , as needed .",
    "so it is perfectly possible for the `` r '' process to be described by a _",
    "stochastic _ unitary process , constructed from a sequence of random or partially random infinitesimal unitary transformations , and we will see in sect . 3.1 examples of how this can be accomplished .      in qm , the probability is the squared modulus of the probability amplitude .",
    "probability amplitudes superimpose coherently , and between measurements evolve in time by the `` u '' process .",
    "thus , in the microscopic realm :    * one sees coherent superpositions .",
    "* amplitudes evolve through deterministic , unitary evolution .    on the other hand , in the macroscopic realm :    * one does _ not _ see coherent superpositions , e.g. , of dead and alive cats .",
    "* measurements involve the `` r '' process , which is not deterministic unitary .",
    "this dichotomy leaves us with the following questions ( for more detailed discussions , see penrose [ 3 ] and leggett [ 5 ] ) :    * where is the dividing line between `` micro '' and `` macro '' ? * what is responsible for it ?",
    "a unique feature of orthodox qm is that it is the only probabilistic theory where the probabilities are _ postulated _ ab initio , and are not _ emergent _ from unobserved , deterministic phenomena at a deeper level .",
    "a typical theory where probabilites are emergent is statistical mechanics . in statistical mechanics",
    "one starts from a probability postulate of uniform phase space occupation .",
    "this assumption , and the related concept of an equilibrium ensemble ( which reflects the implications of conserved quantities for the phase space occupation ) , is consistent because of liouville s theorem , which implies that a uniform distribution is preserved in time by the dynamics .",
    "however , these probabilistic statements are not the end of the story in statistical mechanics .",
    "there are underlying laws  the equations of classical molecular dynamics  which are deterministic ; no probabilities enter into their formulation .",
    "these laws lead , by a process that is still not completely understood ( as reflected in discussions of ergodicity at this conference ) , to an effectively uniform phase space distribution for systems that are sufficiently complex .",
    "thus , the probabilistic theory of statistical mechanics is _ emergent _ from the deterministic theory of classical mechanics .      to sum up",
    ", there are a number of sources of unease about qm :    * there is no predictive description of individuals .",
    "* there is a micro - macro divide of unclear origin .",
    "* there is a probabilistic structure that is postulated rather than emergent .",
    "but qm works !",
    "many subtle and remarkable predictions of qm are experimentally verified in many different physical arenas .",
    "thus either    * \\(a ) qm is exact , but to deal with the sources of unease it needs reinterpretation at the conceptual level ( although no modification of the standard postulates is needed to use qm as a practical computational and predictive tool ) .",
    "* \\(b ) qm is not exact , but rather is a very accurate asymptotic approximation to a deeper level theory .",
    "i do not believe that it is just a matter of taste which of these possibilites is chosen , because the distinction between ( a ) and ( b ) is relevant to the issue of planck scale unification of the forces and the particle spectrum .",
    "if qm changes , it may profoundly influence the ground rules for unifying gravity with the other interactions .",
    "let us now review four differing approaches based on premise ( a ) , that qm is exactly correct but in need of reinterpretation .",
    "our focus in each case will be on the extent to which the probabilistic structure is postulated or is emergent .      in the `` many worlds '' interpretation introduced by everett [ 6 ] and discussed in further detail in the articles collected in [ 7 ]",
    ", there is no state vector reduction ; instead , there is only schrdinger evolution of the wave function of the entire universe . to describe @xmath38 successive measurements in this interpretation requires an @xmath38-fold tensor product wave function .",
    "probability is not emergent , but rather is postulated in the everett picture .",
    "everett introduces a measure on the coefficients of the final superposition resulting from @xmath38 successive measurements , which as @xmath39 behaves mathematically like the usual qm probability rule .",
    "there is a logical jump ( or an implicit assumption  this is still a matter of debate ) in going from the everett measure on tensor product coefficients to statements about the relative frequencies of experimental outcomes .",
    "there has been a recent revival of interest in bohmian mechanics ( see [ 10 ] for a technical account and references , and [ 11 ] for a semipopular account ) . in bohmian mechanics , in addition to the schrdinger equation for the @xmath38-body wave function @xmath43 , @xmath44 the mathematical framework",
    "is enlarged by introducing hidden `` particles '' moving in configuration space with coordinates @xmath45 and velocities @xmath46 the state of the `` individual '' is then specified by giving both the wave function _ and _ the coordinates @xmath45 of the hidden particles .",
    "a probability postulate is introduced , that the probability distribution on configuration space obeys @xmath47 at some initial time @xmath48 .",
    "the bohmian equations given above then imply that this remains true for all times subsequent to @xmath48 ; the logic here resembles the use of the liouville theorem in statistical mechanics .",
    "unlike statistical mechanics , bohmian mechanics has no underlying molecular dynamics - like layer , so the probabilites are not prima facie emergent .",
    "we note , however , that in [ 10 ] arguments are given ( and are further discussed at this conference ) that the bohmian probability postulate follows from considerations of `` typicality '' of initial configurations ( in distinction to the ergodicity arguments used in attempts to derive the postulates of statistical mechanics from the equations of molecular dynamics ) .",
    "recently ax and kochen [ 12 ] have extended the mathematical framework of qm in a different way to encompass the `` individual '' .",
    "they identify the _ ray _ with the ensemble , and the _ ray representative _",
    ", i.e. the @xmath49 phase associated with a particular state vector , with the individual .",
    "they then give a mathematical construction to specify a unique physical state from knowledge of the toroid of phases .",
    "they introduce a probability assumption , that the a priori distribution of phases is uniform , and then show that , by their construction , this implies that the probabilities of outcomes obey the usual qm rule .",
    "thus , probability in the ax - kochen interpretation is not emergent , but their probabilistic postulate is arguably weaker than that in standard qm or in bohmian qm .",
    "we conclude this brief survey of alternative interpretations of an assumed exact quantum mechanics by posing the question , can the interpretations given above be falsified ? by construction , the four interpretations described above are designed to agree with the predictions of standard qm .",
    "clearly , if an interpretation could be shown to _ differ _ in some prediction from that of qm , and if this difference in predictions were resolved experimentally in favor of standard qm ( in the way that the bell inequalities have been tested and favor qm ) , then the interpretation would be falsified .",
    "but suppose that an interpretation makes empirical predictions that , within the domain in which the rules of qm apply , are without exception indistinguishable from the predictions of qm .",
    "then is it possible , in principle , to falsify that interpretation ?",
    "the answer , i believe , may be `` yes '' , because none of the interpretations described above gives a quantitative account of the micro - macro divide  that is , when do we , and when do nt we , expect to see coherent superpositions ? to the extent that this becomes an experimentally answerable question , and to the extent that one can get corresponding predictions from the interpretations sketched above , one might be able to distinguish between different interpretive frameworks for an exact qm .",
    "let us turn now to approaches based on premise ( b ) , that qm is a very accurate approximation to a deeper level theory .",
    "we will first discuss phenomenological approaches based on this premise , and then turn to attempts at a more fundamental theory .      as we discussed in subsect .",
    "1.3 , although the `` r '' process can not be described by a deterministic unitary evolution , it is perfectly admissible for it to be described by a unitary evolution that differs for each individual measurement act , and in particular by a stochastic unitary evolution .",
    "considerable effort has gone over the past two decades into attempts to unify the `` u '' process and the `` r '' process into a single dynamical rule , by formulating phenomenological modifications of the schrdinger equation in which the `` individual '' is described by a stochastic unitary evolution of a pure state .",
    "the physical motivation for such modifications is that if quantum theory is an approximation to physics at a deeper level , there could be small fluctuation or `` brownian motion '' corrections to this physics , which determine the outcomes for individual systems .",
    "various cases are possible , depending on the choice of @xmath70 :    * for an _ energy driven process _ , with @xmath71 , the stationary value @xmath63_s$ ] can be any function of @xmath69 .",
    "one can then prove [ 15 ] _ with no approximations _ that , when all energy eigenstates are nondegenerate , in the limit of large times , @xmath5 approaches an energy eigenstate projector @xmath72 , with each such projector occuring as the outcome of the stochastic process with the corresponding probability latexmath:[$p_e = { \\rm tr } \\rho(0 )     density matrix .",
    "correspondingly , the stochastic expectation of @xmath5 , which is what we customarily term the density matrix , evolves from a pure state density matrix @xmath74=\\rho(0)$ ] to the mixed state density matrix @xmath63_s=\\sum_e p_e |e \\rangle \\langle e|$ ] .",
    "thus , for an energy driven process ( or more generally , processes in which there are several @xmath75 which all commute with the hamiltonian ) , the qm probability rule is _ emergent _ from the phenomenological stochastic dynamics . as discussed in [ 14 ] , if one assumes that the parameter @xmath60 and the corresponding stochastic process originate from planck scale physics , one gets the estimate ( again in units with @xmath76=1 ) @xmath77 , which implies a characterstic state vector reduction time scale @xmath78 with @xmath79 the energy dispersion of the initial state .",
    "an important question that remains to be answered is whether this estimate gives a satisfactory phenomenology for state vector reduction in all cases , when the characteristic @xmath79 arising from environmental interaction effects is assumed .",
    "that is , does the predicted micro - macro divide always occur in the right place ? * for a _ localization process _",
    "( the ghirardi , pearle , rimini form of the original ghirardi , rimini , weber idea ; for references see [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] ) , one takes @xmath70 to be an operator that produces a gaussian localization , or one uses multiple @xmath75 corresponding to many such localizations .",
    "since the kinetic term @xmath80 in the hamiltonian @xmath69 does not commute with @xmath81 , and thus does not commute with a localizing operator @xmath70 , there now is _ no _ stationary limit unless the usual schrdinger evolution term in the stochastic schrdinger equation is neglected . in this approximation , in which only the stochastic terms are kept ,",
    "one gets similar results to those found in the energy driven case , with @xmath69 eigenstates replaced now by @xmath70 eigenstates . for the localizing case ,",
    "an important issue that remains to be addressed is whether the phenomenological theory can be made relativistic .",
    "this may be a more severe problem than in the energy driven case because , while the hamiltonian operator @xmath69 of schrdinger dynamics appears in a similar role in quantum field theory , the coordinate @xmath81 appears in quantum field theory as a label for degrees of freedom , rather than as an operator .      of course",
    ", even though the phenomenological stochastic schrdinger equations discussed above give exactly ( in the energy driven case ) or approximately ( in the localizing case ) an emergent qm probability rule , there is still a probabilistic postulate in the form of the appearance of the it differential @xmath50 .",
    "since these equations have the characteristic form expected for the dynamics of open quantum systems , it is natural to ask whether they are simply the brownian motion description of some underlying dynamics .",
    "specifically , can one achieve a fully emergent probabilistic structure at the qm level from a pre - quantum dynamics that is not probabilistic ?",
    "two approaches of this type have been discussed in the literature :    * in [ 16 ] t hooft has proposed that quantum states are the equilibrium limit orbits or poincar cycles of an underlying chaotic , dissipative , deterministic theory . * in [ 17 ] we have proposed as a possible pre - quantum dynamics a `` generalized quantum '' or `` trace '' dynamics , obtained by setting up a generalized classical dynamics of noncommuting phase space variables @xmath82 with no a priori commutativity properties beyond cyclic permutation inside a trace .",
    "one can show that , with an approximation similar to assuming a large hierarchy between the pre - quantum and the qm energy scales , that by an equipartition argument the canonical commutation relations of qm are an emergent property of the statistical mechanics of this system .",
    "both of these proposed approaches to an emergent probability structure in qm are at present programmatic , and significant open questions remain : can one construct an effective wave function and schrdinger equation from the pre - quantum dynamics ? what do the leading fluctuation corrections look like , and are they the mechanism responsible for state vector reduction ? can one use them to make contact with the phenomenological stochastic extensions of the schrdinger equation discussed above ? affirmative answers to these questions would yield the probabilistic structure of qm as an emergent phenomenon , in close analogy with the origins , in the underlying deterministic layer of molecular dynamics , of the probabilistic structure of statistical mechanics .",
    "failure , after sufficient effort , to construct such a pre - quantum underpinning for qm would support the view that qm is exact , in need perhaps only of a modified interpretation .",
