    "the fisher kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite @xmath0 describes how a stable phase ( @xmath1 for @xmath2 ) invades an unstable phase ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 ) and how the front between these two phases builds up and travels @xcite .",
    "this equation was first introduced in a problem of genetics , but equations similar to  ( [ fkpp ] ) appear in much broader contexts like reaction - diffusion problems@xcite , optimization@xcite , disordered systems@xcite and even particle physics@xcite .",
    "a remarkable example is the problem of the high energy scattering of a projectile consisting of a small color dipole on a target in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) : in ref .",
    "@xcite it was recognized that the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , a mean field equation for high energy scattering in qcd , is in the same class as the fkpp equation with @xmath5 being the scattering amplitude , @xmath6 the rapidity of the scattering and @xmath7 the logarithm of the inverse projectile size .",
    "it is well known@xcite that equations like ( [ fkpp ] ) have a family of travelling wave solution of the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "there is a relation between the exponential decay of each solution ( @xmath10 for large @xmath11 ) and its velocity : @xmath12 .",
    "for example , @xmath13 for the fkpp equation  ( [ fkpp ] ) .",
    "other front equations would give different expressions of @xmath14 .",
    "see , for example , section  [ sec : num ] , or refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if one starts with a steep enough initial condition , the front converges to the travelling wave with the minimal velocity .",
    "therefore @xmath15 ( the multiplicative factor @xmath11 in @xmath16 is present only for this slowest moving solution . )",
    "there is a large class ( the fkpp class ) of equations describing the propagation of a front into an unstable state which select the minimal velocity , as described by ( [ defgamma ] ) .",
    "( there exist also equations , called `` pushed '' or `` type  ii '' for which the velocity selected by the front is not the slowest one .",
    "the properties of these fronts are quite different@xcite from the properties of ( [ fkpp ] ) , and we will not consider them in the present paper . )    deterministic front equations such as  ( [ fkpp ] ) usually occur as the limit of a stochastic reaction - diffusion model @xcite when the number of particles ( or bacterias , or reactants ) involved becomes infinite . in a physical situation ,",
    "all numbers remain finite and a small noise term should be added to  ( [ fkpp ] ) to represent the fluctuations at the microscopic scale .",
    "one might write , for instance@xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a normalized gaussian white noise and @xmath19 is the number of particles involved .",
    "the effect of such a noise is to make the shape of the travelling wave fluctuate in time@xcite .",
    "it affects also its velocity and makes the front diffuse@xcite .    for a chemical problem",
    ", @xmath19 might be of the order of the avogadro number and one could think that such a small noise term should give small corrections , of order @xmath20 , to the shape and position of the front . however , because the front motion is extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the region where @xmath21 , this is not the case . in presence of noise as in ( [ noisy ] ) , the front has an exponential decay if @xmath22 , but it vanishes much faster than this exponential in the region where @xmath23 is of order @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "( this is obvious in a particle model , as there can not be less than one particle at a given place . ) as an approximation to understand the effect of the microscopic stochastic details of the system , it has been suggested to replace the noise term by a deterministic cutoff which makes the front vanish very quickly when @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the fkpp equation ( [ fkpp ] ) , one way of introducing the cutoff is @xmath25 in the presence of such a cutoff , the velocity and the shape ( [ defgamma ] ) become , for any equation in the fkpp class ,    @xmath26    [ cutoff ]    ( the shape ( [ h_cutoff ] ) is valid only in the linear region , where @xmath5 is small enough for the nonlinear term @xmath27 to be negligible but still larger than @xmath24 .",
    "note that for @xmath28 , the shape coincides with ( [ defgamma ] ) .",
    "a way to interpret the sine is to say that the front moves slower than the minimal velocity  @xmath29 and that the decay rate becomes complex : @xmath30 .",
    "then , the expression of @xmath31 results from an expansion of @xmath14 for large @xmath32 . )    the prediction ( [ cutoff ] ) does not depend on the details of the microscopic model .",
    "it only depends on the deterministic equation and on the existence of a microscopic scale .",
    "this cutoff picture is also present in the mean field qcd context in  @xcite , where it was introduced to avoid unitarity violating effects in the bk equation at intermediate stages of rapidity evolution . in this context , @xmath19 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "extensive numerical simulations of noisy fronts have been performed over the years@xcite , and the large correction  ( [ v_cutoff ] ) to the velocity found in the cutoff picture seems to give the correct leading correction to the velocity of noisy fronts .",
    "( see @xcite for rigorous bounds . )",
    "being a deterministic approximation , the cutoff theory gives however no prediction for the diffusion constant of the front .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop a phenomenological description which leads to a prediction for this diffusion constant .",
    "this description tries to capture the rare relevant events which give the dominant contribution to the fluctuations in the position of the front .",
    "the prediction is that the full statistics of the front position in the noisy model depends only on the amplitude  @xmath24 of the noise at the microscopic scale and on @xmath14 , a property of the deterministic equation . for large  @xmath19 , all the other details of the underlying microscopic model do not contribute to the leading order .",
    "our description leads to the following prediction for the velocity and for the diffusion constant of the front for large @xmath19 :    [ results ] @xmath35    actually , our phenomenological approach also gives a prediction to the leading order for all the cumulants of the position of the front . for @xmath36 , @xmath37 } { t }",

    "the @xmath39 dependence of the diffusion constant was already observed in numerical simulations @xcite . in the qcd context , it was proposed in @xcite to identify the full qcd problem with a stochastic evolution , such as ( [ noisy ] ) , and the dependence of the diffusion constant was used to suggest a new scaling law for qcd hard scattering at , perhaps , ultrahigh energies .",
    "we do not have , at present , a mathematical proof of the results ( [ resultsvd ] ) and ( [ resultscumulants ] ) .",
    "rather , we believe that we have identified the main effects contributing to the diffusion of the front .",
    "we present our scenario in sec .",
    "[ sec : deriv ] where we state a set of four hypotheses from which the results  ( [ results ] ) follow .",
    "we give arguments to support these hypotheses in sections  [ sec : j1 ] to  [ sec : j4 ] . finally , to check our claims , we present numerical simulations in section  [ sec : num ] for the five first cumulants of the position of the front .",
    "these simulations match very well the predictions  ( [ results ] ) .",
    "to simplify the discussion , we consider , in this section , more specifically a microscopic particle model rather than a continuous stochastic model such as ( [ noisy ] ) .",
    "this is merely a convenience to make our point clearer , but the discussion below could be rephrased for other models in the stochastic fkpp class .",
    "we consider models where particles diffuse on the line and , occasionally , duplicate .",
    "if one considers , for @xmath23 , the density of particles or , alternatively , the number of particles on the right of @xmath7 , it is clear that it is not yet described by a front equation , because it grows exponentially fast with time ; one needs to introduce a saturation rule .",
    "for instance : 1 ) keep the number of particles fixed by removing the leftmost particles if necessary ; or 2 ) remove all the particles which are at a distance larger than  @xmath32 behind the rightmost particle ; or 3 ) limit the density by allowing , with a small probability , that two particles meeting recombine into one single particle@xcite .",
    "the main picture of our phenomenological description is the following .",
    "the evolution of the front is essentially deterministic , and its typical shape and velocity are given by eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) . but from time to time , a fluctuation sends a small number of particles at some distance @xmath40 ahead of the front . at first , the position of the front , determined by where most of the particles are , is only modified by a negligible amount of order @xmath24 by this fluctuation . however , as the system relaxes , the number of wandering particles grows exponentially and they start contributing to the position of the front",
    ". meanwhile the bulk catches up and absorbs the wandering particles and their many offsprings ; finally , the front relaxes back to its typical shape ( [ h_cutoff ] ) .",
    "the net effect of a fluctuation is therefore to shift the position of the front by some amount @xmath41 which depends , obviously , on the size @xmath40 of the fluctuation .",
    "a useful quantity to characterize the fluctuations is the width of the front .",
    "it can easily be defined as the distance between the leading particle ( where @xmath42 ) and some position in the bulk of the front , for instance , where @xmath43 .",
    "( changing this reference point would change the width by a finite amount , independent of @xmath19 ) .",
    "this width is typically of order @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is given by the cutoff theory ( [ h_cutoff ] ) . during a fluctuation that sends particles at a distance @xmath40 ahead of the front , the width of the front increases quickly to @xmath44 , and then relaxes slowly back to @xmath32 .",
    "we emphasize that , in this scenario , the effect of noise is so weak that , most of time , it can be ignored and the cutoff theory describes accurately the evolution of the front .",
    "it is only occasionally , when a rare sequence of random microscopic events sends some particles well ahead of the front that the cutoff theory is no longer valid .",
    "the way this fluctuation relaxes is , however , well described by the deterministic cutoff theory .",
    "we shall encode this scenario in the following quantitative assumptions :    1 .",
    "if we write the instantaneous fluctuating width of the front as @xmath44 , then the probability distribution function for @xmath40 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is some constant .",
    "note that we assume this form only over some relevant range of values : @xmath40 large enough ( compared to 1 ) but much smaller than @xmath32 ( typically of order @xmath47 ) .",
    "fluctuations where @xmath40 is `` too small '' are frequent but do not contribute much to the front position .",
    "fluctuations where @xmath40 is `` too large '' are so rare that we do not need to take them into account . only for `` moderate '' values of @xmath40",
    "do we assume the above exponential probability distribution function .",
    "the long term effect of a fluctuation of size  @xmath40 ( assuming that there are no other fluctuations in - between ) is a shift of the front position by the quantity @xmath48 where @xmath49 is another constant .",
    "3 .   the fluctuations of the position of the front are dominated by large and rare fluctuations of the shape of the front .",
    "we assume that they are rare enough that a given relevant fluctuation has enough time to relax before another one occurs .    from these three hypotheses alone",
    ", one can derive our results  ( [ results ] ) up to a single multiplicative constant .",
    "this constant can be determined with the help of a fourth hypothesis :    1 .",
    "for the aim of computing the first correction to the front velocity obtained in the cutoff theory ( [ cutoff ] ) , one can simply use the expression ( [ v_cutoff ] ) with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath50 where @xmath51 it is important to appreciate that the average or typical width of the front is still @xmath32 and not @xmath50 .",
    "the latter quantity is just what should be used in ( [ v_cutoff ] ) to give the correct velocity .",
    "we are now going to see how the results ( [ results ] ) follow from these four hypotheses .",
    "first , we argue that the probability to observe a fluctuation of size @xmath40 during a time interval @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the distribution  ( [ distlen ] ) of the increase of the width of the front and where @xmath55 is some typical time characterizing the rate at which these fluctuations occur .",
    "indeed , during a fluctuation of a given size , the width of the front increases to that size and then relaxes back . for a large @xmath40 ,",
    "observing a front of size @xmath44 is very rare , but , when it happens , the most probable is that one is observing the maximum expansion of a fluctuation with a size close to @xmath40 ; the contribution from fluctuations of sizes significantly larger than @xmath40 is negligible as they are much less likely .",
    "second , as a fluctuation builds up at the very tip of the front where the saturation rule ( see beginning of section  [ sec : deriv ] ) can be neglected , we argue that the typical time @xmath55 introduced in the previous paragraph and the time it takes to build a fluctuation of a given size do not depend on  @xmath19 .",
    "( however , the relaxation time of a fluctuation depends on  @xmath19 as the bulk of the front is involved in the relaxation . )",
    "let  @xmath56 be the position of the front , @xmath57 the minimal size of a fluctuation giving a relevant contribution to the position of the front and  @xmath52 a time much smaller than the time between two relevant fluctuations , but much larger than the time it takes to build up such a fluctuation and have it relax .",
    "( this is authorized by the third hypothesis . )",
    "we have @xmath58 x_t + v_\\text{cutoff}\\delta t & \\text{proba .",
    "$ 1-\\frac{\\delta t}{\\tau}\\int_{\\delta_0}^\\infty p(\\delta)d\\delta$}. \\end{cases}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( note that @xmath59 is the probability of observing a relevant fluctuation during the time @xmath60 .",
    "by definition of @xmath52 , this is much smaller than 1 . )",
    "one can then compute the average , denoted @xmath61 , of @xmath62 .",

    ". thus appears naturally a @xmath67 which is exactly the effective correction to the width of the front appearing in ( [ 4th ] ) .",
    "the integrals  in eq .",
    "( [ integrals ] ) can be evaluated , and one gets @xmath68 with  @xmath69 . for  @xmath70 , this integral gives  @xmath71 . for  @xmath36 , one can integrate from 0 to  @xmath72 ( the correction is at most of order  @xmath73 ) and one recognizes  @xmath74 .",

    "all the cumulants ( except the first one ) are of the same order of magnitude , as the fluctuations are due to rare big events .",
    "this first hypothesis is not very surprising if one considers that @xmath77 is the natural decay rate of the deterministic equation .",
    "a more quantitative way to understand  ( [ distlen ] ) is that building up a fluctuation is an effect which is very localized at the tip of the front , where saturation effects can be neglected .",
    "we present in appendix  [ infinite ] a calculation using this property .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations@xcite of that probability distribution function give evidence that for large enough @xmath19 , the decay is exponential with the rate  @xmath78 as in  ( [ distlen ] ) .      to obtain ( [ rd ] ) , we need to compute the response of the deterministic model with a cutoff ( [ fkpp - cutoff ] ) to a fluctuation at the tip of the front .",
    "this is a purely deterministic problem : starting with a fluctuation ( _ i.e. _ a configuration slightly different from the stationary shape ) , we let the system evolve with a cutoff and relax back to its stationary shape ( [ h_cutoff ] ) , and we would like to compute the shift in position due to this fluctuation .",
    "although the evolution is purely deterministic , the problem remains a difficult one . for simplicity , we discuss here the case of the fkpp equation ( [ fkpp - cutoff ] ) .",
    "the extension to other travelling wave equations in the fkpp class is straightforward .",
    "there are two non - linearities in ( [ fkpp - cutoff ] ) : one is the @xmath79 term , which is important when @xmath5 is of order 1 , and the other one is the cutoff term @xmath80 , which is important when @xmath5 is of order  @xmath24 . between these two points",
    ", there is a large length of order @xmath81 where one can neglect both non - linearities .",
    "this means that , for all practical purpose , one can simply use the linearized version of the fkpp equation for the whole front except for two small regions with a size of order 1 at both ends of the front .",
    "let @xmath56 be the position of the front , and @xmath82 its length .",
    "there are many equivalent ways of defining precisely these quantities ; for instance we can take @xmath56 such that @xmath83 and @xmath82 such that @xmath84 .",
    "we expect that @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which are quantities of order 1 , have a relaxation time of order  @xmath87 , as for the shape of the front .    for @xmath88 ,",
    "the problem is linear : @xmath89 using the ansatz @xmath90 with @xmath91 ( see ( [ v_cutoff ] ) for @xmath13 ) , and keeping only the dominant terms in  @xmath32 , the function  @xmath92 evolves according to @xmath93 with the boundary conditions @xmath94 ( more precisely , @xmath95 and @xmath96 would be non zero only at the next order in a @xmath97 expansion . )",
    "the problem reduces to a diffusion problem with absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the stationary configuration is the sine shape ( [ h_cutoff ] ) , as expected .",
    "if , at time @xmath98 the shape is different from this stationary configuration , it will relax back to it in the long time limit up to a multiplicative constant : @xmath99 as the stationary shape for @xmath23 must be of the form given by ( [ h_cutoff ] ) , we obtain , using ( [ ansatz ] ) that the final shift in position is given by @xmath100    to compute the value of @xmath101 , one simply needs to project the initial condition on the sine shape : @xmath102    we now proceed to use this expression for the perturbations we are interested in : perturbations localized near the cutoff .",
    "we do not have a full information on the initial condition @xmath103 or , equivalently , @xmath104 .",
    "however , as we expect a perturbation to grow at the very tip of the front , we expect that @xmath103 is identical to its stationary shape , except in a region of size of order @xmath105 on its tip . on the scale we consider ,",
    "this means that @xmath104 is perturbed over a region of size @xmath106 . in other words : @xmath107,\\ ] ] where the perturbation @xmath108 is non - zero only for @xmath109 of order  @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ firstmode ] ) , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a number of order 1 representing the extent over which a perturbation initially affects the shape of the front .",
    "( @xmath112 if @xmath113 . )",
    "the precise shape of @xmath108 is not known , but its amplitude can be easily understood in a stochastic particle model : if some particles are sent at a distance @xmath114 ahead of the front , @xmath23 increases by @xmath24 at position @xmath115 . because of the exponential factor in ( [ ansatz ] ) , this translates to an increase of order @xmath116 for the reduced shape @xmath92 . combining everything , one finally gets @xmath117 where @xmath49 is some number of order  1 which depends on the precise shape @xmath108 . expression  ( [ erdelta ] ) is just our second hypothesis , up to factors  @xmath78 which can be put back by dimensional analysis .",
    "one consequence of the argument above is that @xmath49 is of order  1 compared to @xmath32 .",
    "however , it gives no information about the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath40 or on the shape of the fluctuation .",
    "we think that if @xmath49 depends on @xmath40 , it is a weak dependence that we can ignore .",
    "a simple situation where this can be checked is when @xmath40 is large : if a particle jumps sufficiently far ahead , it will start a front of its own that will completely replace the original front .",
    "for such a front , it is well known@xcite that the position for large  @xmath6 is given at first ( while the cutoff is not relevant ) by @xmath118 . when the velocity @xmath119 matches @xmath31 , that is at a time @xmath120 , a crossover occurs and the position becomes @xmath121 . matching the two expressions for the position at time @xmath122 , one obtains @xmath123 , as predicted by  ( [ rd ] ) .",
    "this indicates that , at least for large @xmath40 , the number @xmath49 has no @xmath40 dependence .      from section  [ sec : deriv ] and eq .",
    "( [ rd ] ) , the size  @xmath40 of the fluctuations that contribute significantly to the diffusion of the front are such that  @xmath124 . from ( [ distlen ] ) ,",
    "the typical time between two such fluctuations is therefore  @xmath125 . on the other hand , from section  [ sec : j2 ] ,",
    "the relaxation time of a fluctuation is of order  @xmath87 .",
    "it is therefore safe to assume that a relevant fluctuation has enough time to relax before another one occurs .",
    "the fourth hypothesis states that , to compute the shift in velocity , one should use a front width @xmath50 that is larger than what is predicted by the cutoff theory by an amount @xmath126 .",
    "the hypothesis is plausible as this length is precisely the distance  @xmath40 at which the relevant fluctuations occur : the main effect of the fluctuations would then be to increase the effective width of the front that enters the cutoff theory  ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "we present in appendix  [ wall ] a simplified model to support this claim .",
    "remarkably , the front width @xmath50 emerges naturally in the qcd context@xcite .",
    "we consider here a reaction - diffusion model with saturation which was introduced in  @xcite as a toy model for high energy scattering in qcd .",
    "particles are evolving in discrete time on a one - dimensional lattice . at each timestep",
    ", a particle may jump to the nearest position on the left or on the right with respective probabilities @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and may divide into two particles with probability @xmath63 .",

    "our numerical data is shown in figure  [ cumulants ] together with the analytical predictions obtained from  ( [ results ] ) ( dotted lines in the figure ) .",
    "we see that the numerical simulations get very close to the analytical predictions at large @xmath19 .",
    "however , like in the case of @xmath50 , higher order corrections are presumably still important for the lowest values of @xmath19 displayed on the plot .",
    "we try to account for these corrections by replacing the factor @xmath170 in the denominator of the expression for the cumulants in eq .",
    "( [ results ] ) by the ansatz for @xmath50 given in  ( [ ansatzleff ] ) , _ without retuning the parameters_. the results are shown in figure  [ cumulants ] ( full lines ) , and are in excellent agreement with the numerical data over the whole range of  @xmath19 .",
    "we could also have refitted the parameters @xmath171 and @xmath172 for each cumulant separately , as , a priori , they are not predicted by our theory .",
    "we observe that this is not required by our data .",
    "this last observation suggests that all the cumulants can be computed , with a good accuracy , with the effective width  @xmath50 as the only parameter .",
    "we check this on figure  [ ratio ] , which represents the ratio of the @xmath173-th cumulant ( divided by time ) by the correction to the velocity @xmath174 to the power @xmath175 .",
    "if one supposes that the correction to the velocity varies like @xmath176 and the cumulants like @xmath177 for some effective width  @xmath50 , this width disappears from the ratio plotted and one can compare the numerical results to our analytical prediction with no free parameter or unknown subleading terms . within statistical error , the data seem to agree for @xmath19 large enough with our prediction , suggesting that , indeed , all the cumulants can be described with a good accuracy with only the effective width  @xmath50 .",
    "simulations , not shown here , for the model introduced in  @xcite support also our predictions  ( [ results ] ) .",
    "the main idea that we have put forward in the present work is that all the fluctuations of the front position , and in particular the diffusion constant , are dominated by large but rare fluctuations at the tip of the front .    under some more precise assumptions ( hypotheses of section  [ sec : deriv ] ) on these fluctuations",
    ", we were able to obtain explicit expressions ( [ results ] ) of the cumulants of the position of the front .",
    "we checked these predictions in our numerical simulations of section  [ sec : num ] . in section",
    "[ sec : justification ] , we gave some arguments in support of the four hypotheses of section  [ sec : deriv ] .",
    "none of these arguments can be regarded as a mathematical derivation , and we can imagine that some details , such as the precise shape of the distribution of fluctuations ( [ distlen ] ) or the explicit expression ( [ rd ] ) , could be slightly modified by a more precise analysis .",
    "we believe however , given the good agreement of the predictions ( [ results ] ) with the numerical simulations , that our picture is very close , if not identical , to the actual behavior of the front for large values of @xmath19 .    to conclude , we would like to point out the remarkable similarity between the predictions  ( [ results ] ) and the exact results obtained recently@xcite in the context of directed polymers . basically , the results of  @xcite are the same , _ mutatis mutandis _ as our present results  ( [ results ] ) , for all the cumulants .",
    "the only significant change is that the @xmath178 for the velocity and the @xmath179 dependence for all the cumulants in  ( [ results ] ) corresponds , in @xcite , to a @xmath180 for the velocity and a @xmath181 for all the cumulants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 23 ) with @xmath81 .",
    "the term @xmath182 in the velocity corresponds to @xmath31 , see eq .",
    "what is interesting is that our scenario of section  [ sec : deriv ] for fkpp fronts applies also for the system studied in  @xcite : indeed , the fluctuations of the position are mainly due to the rare big events taking place at the tip of the `` front '' , ( * ? ? ? * last paragraph before conclusion ) , the position of the rightmost particle is given by ( [ distlen ] ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 32 ) with @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) , the effect of a large fluctuation can be written as ( [ rd ] ) with the @xmath125 term replaced by @xmath32 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the log of  ( 34 ) can be written as @xmath185 ) , relevant fluctuation ( of size @xmath47 instead of @xmath186 ) appears every @xmath32 timesteps ( instead of every @xmath125 timesteps ) and the relaxation time is 1 instead of @xmath87 .",
    "this similarity may add a further piece of evidence for our results .",
    "this work was partially supported by the us department of energy .",
    "in this appendix , we try to provide an argument for the exponential decay  ( [ distlen ] ) of the distribution for the width of the front . to this aim",
    ", we consider a very simple model of reaction - diffusion : particles diffuse on the line and during each time interval  @xmath188 , each particle duplicates with a probability  @xmath188 . the motions of all the particles are uncorrelated .",
    "if one added a saturation rule as described at the beginning of section  [ sec : deriv ] , the density of particles ( or the number of particles on the right of @xmath7 , depending on the precise saturation rule ) would be described by a stochastic fkpp equation .",
    "however , the saturation affects only the motion of particles in the bulk of the front , where the density is high .",
    "as the fluctuations develop in the low density region , it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of the size of the fluctuations are well described by the model _ without any saturation_.    for this model without saturation , let  @xmath189 the probability that , at time  @xmath6 , no particles are present on the right of  @xmath7 given that , at @xmath98 , there is a single particle at the origin : @xmath190 . during the first `` time step '' @xmath188 , the only particle in the system moves by a quantity  @xmath191 where  @xmath192 is a gaussian number of variance  @xmath193 , and duplicates with a probability  @xmath188 . if it duplicates , the probability  @xmath194 is the probability that the offsprings of both particles are on the left of  @xmath7 .",
    "as the particles have uncorrelated motion , this is the product of the probabilities for each offspring .",
    "finally , one gets@xcite @xmath195 where the average is on  @xmath192 . after simplification ,",
    "@xmath196 one notices that @xmath197 is solution of the deterministic fkpp equation  ( [ fkpp ] ) .",
    "therefore , for large  @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xcite @xmath198 let  @xmath199 be the probability that there are no particles on the right of  @xmath7 when the initial condition is a given density of particles  @xmath200 .",
    "using the fact that all the particles are independent , one gets easily @xmath201 .",
    "\\label{qp}\\ ] ] @xmath202 needs to reproduce the shape of the front seen from the tip . starting from ( [ h_cutoff ] ) , we write  @xmath203 and take the large  @xmath19 limit .",
    "one gets @xmath204 for  @xmath205 and @xmath206 for @xmath207 . evaluating the integral in ( [ qp ] ) , one gets , for large  @xmath6 and @xmath208 , @xmath209 .",
    "\\label{gumbel}\\ ] ] ( notice how the @xmath210 factor canceled out ) .",
    "the probability distribution function of the rightmost particle is clearly  @xmath211 .",
    "we see that in this stochastic model , the front moves at a deterministic velocity equal to  @xmath193 and that the position of the rightmost particle around the position of the front is given by a gumbel distribution .",
    "the distribution  ( [ gumbel ] ) gives our first hypothesis  ( [ distlen ] ) for large fluctuations ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "our attempts to check numerically ( [ gumbel ] ) by simulating fronts with a large but finite number of particles confirmed this exponential decay for large  @xmath40 , but showed some discrepancy for @xmath213 , which we do not understand .",
    "this , however , does not affect the hypothesis  ( [ distlen ] ) .",
    "we consider again the reaction - diffusion model introduced in appendix  [ infinite ] .",
    "as we said , one needs to add a saturation effect to obtain a propagating front equation for the density , but doing so introduces correlations in the motions of the particles that make the model hard to solve . in this appendix",
    ", we introduce an approximate way of adding a saturation effect which does not introduce any such correlation .    in a real front ,",
    "the tip is subject to huge fluctuations happening on short time scales . on the other hand",
    ", the bulk of the front moves smoothly and adjusts very slowly to the fluctuations happening at the tip .",
    "therefore , we believe that , for times not too large , it is a reasonable approximation to assume that the bulk of the front moves at a constant velocity .    to implement this idea , our model is the following : a wall starting at the origin is moving to the right at a constant velocity  @xmath162 .",
    "particles are present on the right of the wall .",
    "the particles are evolving as in appendix  [ infinite ] , except that whenever a particle crosses the wall , it is removed .",
    "we first consider a single particle starting at a distance  @xmath11 of the wall . after a time @xmath6 , either all the offsprings of this particle have been caught by the wall , or some have survived .",
    "we want to compute the probability  @xmath214 that all the particles have been caught at time  @xmath6 .",
    "the original particle , after a time  @xmath188 , is at a distance  @xmath215 from the wall , and it might have duplicated with probability  @xmath188 . using the same method as in appendix  [ infinite ] , one gets @xmath216 with the conditions @xmath217 in the long time limit , @xmath214 converges to the stationary solution @xmath218 , and one recognizes that  @xmath219 is the stationary solution of the fkpp equation  ( [ fkpp ] ) if  @xmath9 . in other words",
    ", @xmath220 is the shape of a travelling front . as this shape reaches  @xmath221 for  @xmath222 , it must be a front with a sine arch and a velocity  @xmath162 smaller than  @xmath193 , as in ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "so if  @xmath223 , the probability  @xmath220 is the shape of the front with a cutoff : @xmath224 ( the extra factor @xmath225 comes from the fact that  @xmath222 is the tip of the front in ( [ 1-e ] ) while it is the bulk of the front in ( [ h_cutoff ] ) . if @xmath226 , all the particles eventually die and @xmath214 converges to  @xmath227 . )    if one starts with a density  @xmath228 of particles at time  @xmath98 , the probability  @xmath229 that everybody dies is given , similarly to  ( [ qp ] ) , by @xmath230.\\ ] ] we consider , as an initial condition , the situation in the real front with  @xmath231 for  @xmath232 as in ( [ h_cutoff ] ) .",
    "one gets , for long times , @xmath233.\\ ] ] we see that the system survives if @xmath234 which , given  @xmath235 , is exactly  ( [ 4th ] ) ."
