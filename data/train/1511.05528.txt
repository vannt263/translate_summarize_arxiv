    "these two planets have similar equilibrium temperatures and scale heights ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) , so this difference is likely due to the higher snr of the warm sub - neptune simulations caused by the relatively high brightness and small size of the adopted host star , gj 1214 .",

    "this error is considerably larger than the h@xmath3o mixing ratio uncertainty we expect for the warm neptune with a clear solar composition atmosphere and full @xmath104 @xmath1 m wavelength coverage ( table  [ tbl-4 ] ) , and we share the concern with @xcite that stellar activity could be the limiting factor for accurate retrievals of jwst observations of active stars . simultaneous photometric observations at relatively short wavelengths ( e.g. , see * ?",

    "jwst will likely obtain high quality transmission and emission spectra of a variety of exoplanet atmospheres over a wavelength range of at least @xmath104 @xmath1 m .",
    "obtaining spectra over this entire range will typically require observations of 4 separate transit or secondary eclipse events using 4 instrument modes for planets with bright host stars .",
    "we do not know at this time exactly how jwst data will be impacted by systematic noise , but we have assumed noise floors consistent with the best performance of hst or spitzer as appropriate for each wavelength range .",

    "however , @xmath38 @xmath1 m emission spectra provide significantly better constraints than the transmission spectra on the mixing ratios of most molecules for cloudy hot jupiter and warm neptune atmospheres assuming that emission spectra are not impacted by clouds .",
    "each star+planet system should be evaluated to determine whether emission or transmission observations are more favorable for detecting spectral features and constraining parameters of interest .",
    "emission spectra can be more useful than transmission in cases of sufficiently high @xmath7 accompanied by high @xmath8 . acquiring both transmission and emission spectra will probe exoplanet atmospheres over the broadest possible pressure ranges and constrain compositions and chemistries better than either transmission or emission alone .",

    "photometric filter observations may be more useful for constraining the planet s properties .",
