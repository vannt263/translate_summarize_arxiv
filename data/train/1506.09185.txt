    "the search for novel quantum states of matter arising from the interplay of strong electronic correlations , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , and crystal field splitting has recently gained strong impetus in the context of @xmath5 and @xmath6 transition metal oxides  @xcite .",
    "the layered iridates of the a@xmath1iro@xmath2 ( a = na , li ) family  @xcite have been at the center of this search because of the prediction  @xcite that the dominant interactions in these magnets constitute the celebrated kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice , one of the few exactly solvable models hosting gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids ( qsls )  @xcite .",
    "this aspect together with the realization that the kitaev spin liquid is stable with respect to moderate heisenberg - like perturbations  @xcite has triggered a lot of experimental activity on a@xmath1iro@xmath2 and , more recently , on the similar @xmath3-rucl@xmath2 compound  @xcite .    in the layered a@xmath1iro@xmath2 magnets , the single - ion ground state configuration of ir@xmath7 is an effective pseudospin @xmath8 doublet , where spin and orbital angular momenta are intertwined due to the strong soc . in the original kitaev - heisenberg model proposed by jackeli and khaliullin  @xcite , the pseudospins couple via two competing nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions : an isotropic antiferromagnetic ( afm ) heisenberg exchange , @xmath9 , and a highly anisotropic kitaev interaction , @xmath4 , which is strong and ferromagnetic , a fact that is also confirmed by _",

    "they show , respectively , afm zigzag and incommensurate long - range magnetic orders , none of which is actually present in the kitaev - heisenberg model for fm @xmath4 coupling .    -@xmath0 model with three types of nn ( solid ) and nnn (",

    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are two primitive translations and @xmath12 is a lattice constant .",
    "we also show the vertical 2-leg ladders ( shaded strips ) discussed in the text , and the four - sublattice decomposition ( a - d ) related to the operations @xmath13 and @xmath14 , see text . ]",
    "the most natural way to obtain these magnetic states is by including further neighbor heisenberg couplings  @xcite , which are non - negligible due to extended nature of the @xmath6-orbitals of ir@xmath7 ions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent calculations by sizyuk _ et al _  @xcite based on the _ ab - initio _ density - functional data of foyevtsova _ et al _  @xcite have shown that , for na@xmath1iro@xmath2 , the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) exchange paths must also give rise to an anisotropic , kitaev - like coupling @xmath0 , which turns out to be afm .",
    "more importantly , this coupling is the largest interaction after @xmath4 .",
    "it has also been argued  @xcite that @xmath0 plays an important role in the stabilization of the ic spiral state in li@xmath1iro@xmath2 and might be deduced from the strong - coupling limit of hubbard model with topological band structure  @xcite .",
    "recent structural  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite studies have shown that the layered honeycomb magnet @xmath3-rucl@xmath2 is another example of a strong soc mott insulator , where the ru@xmath15 ions are again described by effective @xmath8 doublets . at low @xmath16 , this magnet exhibits zigzag ordering as in na@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the superexchange derivations  @xcite based on the _ ab initio _ tight - binding parameters show that the nnn coupling @xmath0 is again appreciable , and the signs of both @xmath4 and @xmath0 are reversed compared to na@xmath1iro@xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath4 is afm and @xmath0 is fm ) .",
    "however , a strong off - diagonal symmetric nn exchange @xmath17 term  @xcite , which is allowed by symmetry , is also present  @xcite , together with a much smaller @xmath9 coupling .",
    "this compound must then be examined in connection to @xmath17 , @xmath0 , and @xmath9 , since the @xmath17 term alone is not sufficient to explain the experimental situation , as we discuss at length in sec .",

    "here we consider the minimal extension of the nn kitaev model that incorporates the effect of @xmath0 , the @xmath4-@xmath0 model . we show that an extremely weak @xmath0 is enough to stabilize the zig - zag phases relevant for na@xmath1iro@xmath2 and @xmath3-rucl@xmath2 , without introducing large , second and third neighbor heisenberg exchange @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are present in these compounds , the key point is that the kitaev spin liquid is significantly more fragile against @xmath0 than @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , in conjunction with the above predictions from superexchange derivations , our findings suggest that any adequate minimal model of these compounds should include the nnn coupling @xmath0 .",
    "a very striking aspect of the zig - zag phases ( shared by all magnetic phases ) of the @xmath4-@xmath0 model is that they are only stabilized for quantum spins and not for classical spins , despite having a strong classical character .",
    "indeed , these phases are ising - like ( with spins pointing along one of the three cubic axes ) , they are protected by a large excitation gap in the interacting @xmath20 spin - wave spectrum , and the spin lengths are extremely close to their classical value of @xmath21 . yet",
    ", these phases can not be stabilized in the classical limit , in stark contrast to the conventional situation where quantum and thermal fluctuations work in parallel and often lead to the same order - by - disorder phenomena . instead ,",
    "this rare situation we encounter here stems from the manifestly different symmetry structure of the classical and quantum hamiltonians , and the underlying principle that time reversal can only act globally in quantum systems ( see below ) .",
    "this aspect has important ramifications for the phase diagram at zero and finite temperatures @xmath16 .",

    "it turns out that the physics actually remains the same under a simultaneous sign change of @xmath4 and @xmath0 , because this can be gauged away by an operation @xmath41 , which is the product of @xmath42-rotations around the @xmath43 , @xmath33 , and @xmath44 axis , respectively , for the b , c , and d sublattices of fig .",

    "duality is a very common feature in many spin - orbital models  @xcite but does not exist when heisenberg couplings are also present ( in contrast to the symmetry @xmath14 discussed below ) . here",
    "it reduces our study to the first two quadrants of the unit circle of @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] shows the quantum phase diagram as found by exact diagonalizations ( ed ) on finite clusters , see discussion below and numerical data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ] .",
    "there are six different regimes as a function of the angle @xmath45 : the two quantum spin liquids ( qsls ) regions ( which have been enlarged for better visibility ) around the exactly solvable kitaev points ( @xmath46 and @xmath42 ) and four long - range magnetic regions ( i - iv ) , hosting fm , neel , stripy , as well as the zig - zag phases that are relevant for na@xmath1iro@xmath2 ( ii ) and @xmath3-rucl@xmath2 ( iv ) . under the duality transformation @xmath13 , the two qsls map to each other , i maps to iii , and ii maps to iv .",
    "each of the magnetic regions actually hosts twelve degenerate quantum states , some of which are even qualitatively different among themselves , with very distinct bragg reflections .",
    "for example , the region iii hosts six fm and six stripy afm ground states , and iv hosts six nel and six zigzag afm ground states .",
    "this striking aspect stems from a non - global symmetry , @xmath14 , which is the product of @xmath42-rotations around the @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath33 axis , respectively , for the b , c , and d sublattices of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the two states shown in each magnetic region of fig .  [ fig : phasediagram ] are related to each other by this symmetry , which for these particular states amounts to flipping the z - component of the spins in every second shaded ladder of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the remaining ten states of the quantum ground state manifold arise by applying the global symmetries of the model : i ) the double cover @xmath37 of @xmath47 , and ii ) the double cover @xmath48 of the @xmath49 group of global @xmath42 rotations in spin space .",
    "let us now turn to the numerical spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ]  ( a , b ) .",
    "first , the qsl regions are extremely narrow : they survive in a tiny window of @xmath50 around the exact kitaev points , which is confirmed by the comparison of ed against large scale pseudofermion functional renormalization group ( pffrg ) calculations  @xcite . so the qsls are extremely fragile against @xmath0 .    second , fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ]  ( a , b ) show very dense spectral features in the qsl regions , reflecting the continuum structure of fractionalized excitations above the kitaev spin liquid . more specifically , for finite systems the ground state degeneracy at the exact kitaev points   is lifted by @xmath0 .",
    "still , for small enough @xmath51 , the qsls must be gapless in the thermodynamic limit , because @xmath0 respects time reversal symmetry and is therefore not expected  @xcite to open a gap in the majorana spectrum  , before the transitions to the magnetically ordered phases . ] .",
    "third , unlike the qsl regions , the low - energy spectrum inside the magnetic regions is very discrete .",
    "in addition , most of the low - lying states within the energy window shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ed ]  ( a , b ) correspond precisely to the twelve quantum ground states discussed above . for finite systems",
    ", these states are admixed by a finite tunneling , leading to twelve symmetric eigenstates with quantum numbers corresponding to the decomposition of the symmetry broken states .",
    "this decomposition is worked out in detail in @xcite and is indeed fully consistent with the ed data .",
    "so the lowest twelve states in each magnetic region of figs .  [ fig : ed ]  ( a , b ) will collapse to zero energy in the thermodynamic limit , leaving the true magnon excitations with a large anisotropy gap ( modulo finite size corrections ) , reflecting the anisotropic , ising - like character of the magnetic model .",
    "fourth , the magnetic instabilities , which serve as good examples of deconfinement - confinement transitions  @xcite for the underlying spinons , are of first order , as they are accompanied by finite , abrupt changes   in several ground state properties , e.g. , in @xmath52 , and in the spin - spin correlations .",
    "specifically , at @xmath46 and @xmath42 , all fluxes @xmath53 have a value of @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "a finite @xmath0 admixes sectors of different @xmath53 , and so @xmath52 drops continuously as we depart from the exact kitaev s points , until it jumps to very low absolute values when we enter the magnetic phases , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ]  ( c ) .    turning to the spin - spin correlations ,",
    "their abrupt change at the transition can be seen in the behavior of the ` symmetrized ' spin structure factor @xmath55 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ]  ( d ) , which is defined as ( ) = _ _ 0 e^i^()s^_0 s^ _  , where @xmath56 is the number of sites , @xmath57 is the ordering wavevector ( see below ) of the @xmath3-th component of the spins ( @xmath58 ) , and the extra factor of @xmath59 in this definition accounts for the fact  @xcite that , for finite systems , there are no correlations between nn ladders like the ones shaded in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , due to the non - global symmetry @xmath14 discussed above .",
    "these data show clearly the short - range ( long - range ) character of spin - spin correlations inside ( outside ) the qsl regions .",
    "this aspect can be seen more directly in fig .",
    "[ fig : edlrspinprofiles ] , which shows the real - space spin - spin correlation profiles @xmath60 , in the three channels @xmath58 , as calculated in the ground state of the 32-site cluster , inside the first qsl phase and slightly outside ( magnetic phase i ) .",
    "the results show clearly the ultra short - range nature of the correlations inside the qsl region , and the long - range nature outside .     cluster , inside the first qsl phase ( @xmath61 , left column ) and inside the magnetic phase i ( @xmath62 , right column ) .",
    "different rows correspond to the three different channels @xmath60 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the reference site @xmath66 is indicated by the small black open circle .",
    "positive ( negative ) correlations are shown by filled blue ( filled red ) circles , whose radius scales with the magnitude of the correlation .",
    "the difference between @xmath67 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 stems from the fact that the 32-site cluster does not have the full point - group symmetry of the infinite lattice , and the momentum point @xmath68 is not equivalent by symmetry to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , see  @xcite . ]    finally , the spin - spin correlation profiles demonstrate the special anisotropic character of the correlations , whereby different spin components @xmath3 are correlated along different directions of the lattice ( or , equivalently , different spin components @xmath3 order at different ordering wavevectors @xmath57 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ) , reflecting the locking between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in this model .",
    "similar behavior is found for all other magnetic phases , including the zig - zag phases that are relevant for na@xmath1iro@xmath2 and @xmath3-rucl@xmath2 .",
    "such a signature of directional dependent kitaev couplings is exactly what has been reported recently by s.  h.  chun _ et al . _ for na@xmath1iro@xmath2  @xcite ; see also last paragraph of sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .    in the following",
    "we shall probe the physical mechanism of the spin liquid instabilities by taking one step back and examining the classical limit first .",
    "for classical spins , the frustration introduced by the @xmath0 coupling is different from the one of the pure @xmath4 model studied by baskaran _",
    "et al _  @xcite . a straightforward classical minimization in momentum space  @xcite gives lines of energy minima instead of a whole branch of minima  @xcite , suggesting a sub - extensive ground state manifold structure , in analogy to compass - like models  @xcite or other special frustrated antiferromagnets  @xcite",
    ".    we can construct one class of ground states by satisfying one of the three types of ising bonds .",
    "we can choose for example the horizontal @xmath71-bonds and align the spins along the @xmath33-axis with relative orientations dictated by the signs of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the energy of the resulting configuration saturates the lower energy bound  @xcite @xmath72 and is therefore one of the ground states .",
    "we can then generate other ground states by noting that @xmath4 and @xmath0 fix the relative signs of the spin projections @xmath73 only within the vertical 2-leg ladders of the lattice ( shaded strips in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) , but do not fix the relative orientation between different ladders , because these couple only via @xmath74 and @xmath75 ising interactions which drop out at the mean field level .",
    "this freedom leads to @xmath76 ground states , where @xmath77 is the number of vertical ladders .",
    "this sub - extensive degeneracy stems from the presence of non - global , _ sliding _",
    "operations  @xcite of flipping @xmath78 for all spins belonging to one vertical ladder .",
    "similarly , we can saturate the @xmath74 or the @xmath75 bonds , leading to 2-leg ladders running along the diagonal directions of the lattice . in total",
    ", this procedure delivers @xmath79 classical ground states .",
    "these states are actually connected in parameter space by valleys formed by other , continuous families of ground states that can be generated by global so(3 ) rotations of the discrete states  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy associated with these valleys is accidental and can therefore be lifted by fluctuations .",
    "this is in fact the situation at finite @xmath16 where thermal fluctuations select one of the three types of discrete ground states , thereby breaking the three - fold symmetry of the model in the combined spin - orbit space .",
    "this corresponds to a finite-@xmath16 nematic phase where spins point along one of the three cubic axes but still sample all of the @xmath76 corresponding states , without any long - range magnetic order . to achieve the latter one needs to spontaneously break all _ sliding _ symmetries and",
    "this can not happen at finite @xmath16 , according to the generalized elitzur s theorem of batista and nussinov  @xcite .",
    "the _ sliding _ symmetries can break spontaneously only at @xmath80 and in all possible ways , which is reflected in the divergence of the spin structure factor along lines in momentum space .",
    "turning to quantum spins , the situation is fundamentally different because the _ sliding _ symmetries are absent from the beginning : to flip one component of the spin we must combine a @xmath42-rotation in spin space and the time reversal operation  -rotation is actually enough ( because the model involves only two types of ising couplings ) , meaning that _ sliding _ symmetries exist also for quantum spins . ] .",
    "the latter , however , involves the complex conjugation which can not be constrained to act locally only on one ladder .",
    "essentially , this means that the ladders must couple to each other dynamically by virtual quantum - mechanical processes , which in turn opens the possibility for long - range magnetic ordering even at finite @xmath16 .",
    "the natural way to understand the dynamical coupling between the ladders is to perform a perturbative expansion around one of the three strong coupling limits where the above discrete states become true quantum - mechanical ground states .",
    "consider for example the limit where the @xmath74 and @xmath75 couplings , denoted by @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are much smaller than the @xmath71 couplings , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "let us also parametrize @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath88 we have @xmath89 decoupled vertical ladders , and @xmath76 quantum ground states .",
    "degenerate perturbation theory  @xcite then shows that the degeneracy is first lifted at fourth order in @xmath90 via three , loop - four virtual processes that involve : ( i ) only @xmath81 , ( ii ) only @xmath82 , and ( iii ) both @xmath81 and @xmath82 perturbations , see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : perttheory ] .",
    "the processes ( i ) give rise to intra - ladder , six - body terms which are nothing else than the flux operators @xmath53 .",
    "as shown by kitaev  @xcite , these terms can be mapped to the square lattice toric code  @xcite which has a gapped spin liquid ground state .",
    "next , the processes ( ii ) and ( iii ) give rise to effective , nnn inter - ladder couplings of the form @xmath91 , where @xmath66 and @xmath25 have the same ( ii ) or different ( iii ) sublattice unit cell indices , see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : perttheory ] . to fourth - order in @xmath90 ,",
    "the corresponding couplings @xmath92 ( i ) , @xmath93 ( ii ) , and @xmath94 ( iii ) read & & j_w=,[eq : jw ] + & & j_1=(k_2^z),[eq : j1 ] + & & j_2= .",
    "[ eq : j2 ] note that @xmath94 is always afm and competes with @xmath93 in the regions i and iii of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "we also emphasize that there is no @xmath95 coupling when @xmath66 and @xmath25 belong to nn ladders .",
    "this is actually true to all orders in perturbation theory , because of the above non - global symmetry @xmath14 , which changes the sign of @xmath73 on every second vertical ladder ( b and c sites of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : perttheory ] shows the behavior of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 as a function of the angle @xmath45 , where the relative factor of @xmath59 between @xmath99 and @xmath18 accounts for their relative contribution to the total classical energy .",
    "close to the exactly solvable points @xmath46 and @xmath42 , the physics is dominated by the flux terms @xmath53 which , as mentioned above , lead to the gapped toric code qsl  @xcite .",

    "the four magnetic phases i - iv of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] are all stabilized by @xmath9 which , according to fig .  [ fig : perttheory ] , is the dominant coupling in a wide region away from @xmath46 and @xmath42 .",
    "note that there are also two windows ( shaded in fig .",
    "[ fig : perttheory ] ) in the beginning of regions i and iii where the two inter - ladder terms compete and @xmath102 .",
    "this opens the possibility for two more states ( the ones favored by @xmath18 ) in these regions .",
    "this scenario is however not confirmed by our ed spectra and spin structure factors ( especially for the 32-site cluster which is commensurate with both types of competing phases ) , showing that these phases are eventually preempted by the qsls and the phases i and iii at higher values of @xmath90 .",
    "we remark here that the 1-loop formulation of pffrg delivers the @xmath18 but not the @xmath93 processes because , in a diagrammatic formulation of abrikosov fermions , these processes relate to @xmath103-particle vertex contributions , which require a 2-loop formulation .",
    "however , for @xmath45 around @xmath104 and @xmath42 , where @xmath9 is small , a 1-loop formulation already yields good agreement .",
    "the magnetic phases of the model can be captured by a standard semiclassical expansion , but this has to go beyond the non - interacting spin - wave level .",
    "indeed , the zero - point energy of the quadratic theory lifts the accidental continuous degeneracy of the problem ( selecting the cubic axes for the global direction in spin space , see ref .   [ ] ) , but fails to lift the discrete @xmath76 degeneracy ( the spectrum has lines of zero modes corresponding to the soft classical twists along individual ladders ) , and does not deliver a finite spin length , in analogy to several frustrated models  @xcite .",
    "the spurious zero modes are gapped out by spin - wave interactions , leading to the expected anisotropy gap and a finite spin length .",
    "the latter ( obtained here from a self - consistent treatment of the quartic theory ; details will be given elsewhere ) tracks closely the behavior of the spin length extracted from the ed ` symmetrized ' spin structure factor   in this definition accounts for the fact that there are no correlations between nn ladders for finite systems , due to the symmetry @xmath14 , see also [ ] ] @xmath55 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ]  ( d ) .",
    "furthermore , both methods give values that are very close to the classical value of @xmath21 inside the magnetic regions , showing that these phases are very robust .",
    "the quartic spin wave expansion is however insensitive to the proximity of the qsls , most likely due to the first - order character of the transitions .",
    "at @xmath105 the system decomposes into two inter - penetrating triangular sublattices , where the @xmath0 coupling plays the role of a nn kitaev coupling .",
    "this problem has been studied for both classical  @xcite and quantum spins  @xcite . the above analysis for the magnetic phases still holds here , the only difference being that the two legs of each ladder decouple , since they belong to different triangular sublattices .",
    "the ordering between the legs belonging to the same sublattice stems from the _ effective _ coupling @xmath9 , which is the only one surviving at @xmath30 .",
    "this coupling connects nnn legs only , leading to twelve states in each sublattice and thus @xmath106 states in total , instead of 12 for finite @xmath4 .",
    "the accumulation of such extra states at low energies can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed](a - b ) at @xmath105 .",
    "note that while the ed spectra are broadly independent of system size , significant differences between the two cluster sizes are apparent near @xmath107 .",
    "these differences , e.g. on the ground state multiplicity , can be easily traced back to the different point group symmetry of the two clusters , see detailed explanation in @xcite .",
    "finally we would like to point out that the origin of the ordering mechanism at the triangular kitaev points has also been discussed independently in a recent paper by g.  jackeli and a.  avella  @xcite .",
    "charting out the stability region of the kitaev spin liquid is an extremely relevant endeavor for the synthesis and characterization of new materials .",
    "one of the counterintuitive results of this study is that the frustrating ( with respect to long - range magnetic order ) nnn coupling @xmath0 , which has exactly the same anisotropic form and symmetry structure as the @xmath4 term , destabilizes the kitaev spin liquid much faster than the non - frustrating isotropic heisenberg @xmath9 coupling .",
    "this finding gives a very useful hint in the search of realistic materials that exhibit the kitaev spin liquid physics .",
    "in a@xmath1iro@xmath2 materials , for example , the role of the size of the central ion ( na in na@xmath1iro@xmath2 , or li in li@xmath1iro@xmath2 ) in mediating the @xmath0 coupling ( see also below ) is a key aspect that can be easily controlled by experimentalists  @xcite .    on a more conceptual note ,",
    "the physical mechanism underpinning the magnetic long range ordering in the present model is a novel example of order - by - disorder .",
    "unlike many other classical states , here the ordering manifests only for quantum spins and not for classical spins .",
    "this striking contrast between classical and quantum spins is even more surprising in the light of the fact that all these phases have a strong classical character with local pseudo - spin lengths that are very close to the maximum classical value of @xmath21 .    on this issue",
    ", we should stress that there is no discrepancy between the very large pseudo - spin length that we report here and the small length of the magnetic moments extracted from magnetic reflections , e.g. , in na@xmath1iro@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "such an apparent discrepancy can be explained by the value of the @xmath108-factor which can be significantly smaller then @xmath59 , because the orbital angular momentum is not quenched in strong soc compounds .",
    "for the ideal cubic symmetry , for example , the well - known land formula gives @xmath109 , and similar values could be expected for lower symmetry .",
    "let us now elucidate further our main reasons on why the @xmath0 coupling must play an important role in na@xmath1iro@xmath2 , and can be relevant in li@xmath1iro@xmath2 and @xmath3-rucl@xmath2 :    \\i ) the super - exchange expansion of @xcite shows clearly that the nnn kitaev coupling is the second largest term in na@xmath1iro@xmath2 , with @xmath110-@xmath111  mev .",

    "the k@xmath1 coupling stabilizes the zig - zag phase but it is unable to lock the direction of the moments at the mean - field level due to an infinite accidental degeneracy .",
    "the fact that the locking along the cubic axes in the k@xmath114-k@xmath1 model eventually proceeds via a quantum order - by - disorder process ( see ref .  [ ] ) renders this result very susceptible to much smaller anisotropic interactions that can pin the direction of the moments already at the mean field level .",
    "a very small positive anisotropic @xmath17 term can for example play such a role and can account for the locking along the face diagonals , as can be directly seen by a straightforward minimization of the classical energy .",
