    "photohadronic interactions in high - energy astrophysical accelerators are , besides proton - proton interactions , the key ingredient of hadronic source models . the smoking gun signature of these interactions may be the neutrino production from charged pions , which could be detected in neutrino telescopes  @xcite , such as icecube ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for the general theory of the astrophysical sources .",
    "for instance , in grbs , photohadronic interactions are expected to lead to a significant flux of neutrinos in the fireball scenario  @xcite . on the other hand , in agn models ,",
    "the neutral pions produced in these interactions may describe the second hump in the observed photon spectrum , depending on the dominance of synchrotron or inverse compton cooling of the electrons .",
    "the protons in these models are typically assumed to be accelerated in the relativistic outflow together with electron and positrons by fermi shock acceleration .",
    "the target photon field is typically assumed to be the synchrotron photon field of the co - accelerated electrons and positrons .",
    "also thermal photons from broad line regions , the accretion disc , and the cmb may serve as target photon field . the latter case , relevant for the cosmogenic neutrino flux , is not considered in detail .",
    "the basic ideas of complete hadronic models for agn have been described already in previous works @xcite , as well as leptonic models have been discussed by @xcite . in the first place",
    ", these models have been used as static models to describe steady - state spectral energy distributions . but",
    "with today s generation of gamma - ray telescopes , a detailed analysis of the dynamics of very high energetic sources is possible , and time - dependent modeling is inevitable . for the case of leptonic models , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "a necessary prerequisite for a time - dependent hadronic modeling is the efficient computation of the photohadronic interactions .",
    "the on - line calculation via monte carlo simulations is not feasible , therefore a parametric description is the most viable way ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the prediction of neutrino fluxes in many source models relies on the photohadronic neutrino production . in this case , astrophysical neutrinos are normally assumed to originate from pion decays , with a flavor ratio at the source of @xmath4 arising from the decays of both primary pions and secondary muons .",
    "however , it was pointed out in ref .  @xcite that such sources may become opaque to muons at higher energies , in which case the flavor ratio at the source changes to @xmath5 . therefore , one can expect a smooth transition from one type of source to the other as a function of the neutrino energy @xcite , depending on the cooling processes of the intermediate muons , pions , and kaons .",
    "recently , the use of flavor information has been especially proposed to extract some information on the particle physics properties of the neutrinos and the properties of the source ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "for instance , if the neutrino telescope has some flavor identification capability , this property can be used to extract information on the decay @xcite and oscillation @xcite parameters , in a way which might be synergistic to terrestrial measurements .",
    "of course , the flavor ratios may be also used for source identification , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . except from flavor identification",
    ", the differentiation between neutrinos and antineutrinos could be useful for the discrimination between @xmath6 and @xmath7 induced neutrino fluxes , or for the test of neutrino properties ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "a useful observable may be the glashow resonance process @xmath8 at around @xmath9  @xcite to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos in the detector . within the photohadronic interactions ,",
    "the @xmath1 to @xmath2 ratio determines the ratio between electron neutrinos and antineutrinos at the source .",
    "therefore , a useful source model for these applications should include accurate enough flavor ratio predictions , including the possibility to include the cooling of the intermediate particles , as well as @xmath1 to @xmath2 ratio predictions . in addition , the computation of the neutrino fluxes should be efficient enough to allow for reasonable parameter studies or to be used as a fit model .",
    "photohadronic interactions in astrophysical sources are typically either described by the refined monte - carlo simulation of the sophia software  @xcite , which is partially based on @xcite , or are in very simplified approaches computed with the @xmath10-resonance approximation @xmath11 the sophia software probably provides the best state - of - the - art implementation of the photo - meson production , including not only the @xmath10-resonance , but also higher resonances , multi - pion production , and direct ( @xmath12-channel ) production of pions .",
    "kaon production is included as well by the simulation of the corresponding qcd processes ( fragmentation of color strings ) .",
    "the treatment in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ds ] ) , on the other hand , has been considered sufficient for many purposes , such as estimates for the neutrino fluxes .",
    "however , both of these approaches have disadvantages : the statistical monte carlo approach in sophia is too slow for the efficient use in every step of modern time - dependent source simulations of agns and grbs .",
    "the treatment in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ds ] ) , on the other hand , does not allow for predictions of the neutrino - antineutrino ratio and the shape of the secondary particle spectra , because higher resonances and other processes contribute significantly to these .",
    "one possibility to obtain a more accurate model is to use different interaction types with different ( energy - dependent ) cross sections and inelasticities ( fractional energy loss of the initial nucleon ) .",
    "for example , one may define an interaction type for the resonances , and an interaction type for multi - pion production ( see , _ e.g. _ , and others ) .",
    "typically , such approaches do not distinguish @xmath1 from @xmath2 production .",
    "an interesting alternative has been proposed in @xcite , which approximates the sophia treatment analytically .",
    "it provides a simple and efficient way to compute the electron , photon , and neutrino spectra , by integrating out the intermediate particles .",
    "naturally , the cooling of the intermediate particles can not be included in such an approach .",
    "since we are also interested in the cooling of the intermediate particles ( muons , pions , kaons ) , we follow a different direction .",
    "we propose a simplified model based on the very first physics principles , which means that the underlying interaction model can be easily adapted if new data are provided . in this approach , we include the intermediate particles explicitely .",
    "we illustrate the results for the neutrino spectra , but the extension to photons and electrons / positrons is straightforward .    more explicitly , the requirements for our interaction model are the following :    * the model should predict the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 fluxes separately , which is needed for the prediction of photon , neutrino , and antineutrino fluxes , and their ratios . *",
    "the model should be fast enough for time - dependent calculations and for systematic parameter studies .",
    "this , of course , requires compromises .",
    "for example , compared to sophia , our kinematics treatment will be much simpler .",
    "* the particle physics properties should be transparent , easily adjustable and extendable .",
    "* the model should be applicable to arbitrary proton and photon input spectra . *",
    "the secondaries ( pions , muons , kaons ) should not be integrated out , because a ) their synchrotron emission may contribute to observations , b ) the muon ( and pion / kaon ) cooling affects the flavor ratios of neutrinos , and c ) pion cooling may be in charge of a second spectral break in the prompt grb neutrino spectrum , see  @xcite .",
    "* the cooling and escape timescales of the photohadronic interactions as well as the proton / neutron re - injection rates should be provided , since these are needed for time - dependent and steady - state models . * the kaons leading to high energy neutrinos",
    "should be roughly provided , since their different cooling properties may lead to changes in the neutrino flavor ratios ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we incorporate a simplified kaon production treatment to allow for the test of the impact of such effects .",
    "this also serves as a test case for how to include new processes .    for the underlying physics",
    ", we mostly follow similar principles as in sophia .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basics ] , we review the basic principles of the particle interactions , in particular , the necessary information ( response function ) to compute the meson photo - production for arbitrary photon and proton input spectra . in sec .  [ sec : photo ] , we summarize the meson photo - production as implemented in the sophia software , but we simplify the kinematics treatment . in sec .  [",
    "sec : simplemodels ] , we define simplified models based on that . as a key component , we define appropriate interaction types such that we can factorize the two - dimensional response function . in sec .  [",
    "sec : comparison ] , we then summarize the weak decays and compare the different approaches with each other and with the output from the sophia software .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we provide in app .",
    "[ app : others ] how the cooling and escape timescales , and how the neutron / proton re - injection can be computed in our simplified models .",
    "this study is supposed to be written for a broad target audience , including particle and astrophysicists .",
    "for the notation , we follow @xcite , where we first focus on weak decays , such as @xmath13 , and then extend the discussion to photohadronic interactions .",
    "let us first consider a single decay process .",
    "the production rate @xmath14 ( per energy interval ) of daughter particles of species @xmath15 and energy @xmath16 from the decay of the parent particle @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the differential spectrum of parent particles ( particles per energy interval ) , and @xmath20 is the interaction or decay rate ( probability per unit time and particle ) for the process @xmath21 as a function of energy @xmath22 ( which is assumed to be zero below the threshold ) . since in pion photoproduction many interaction types contribute , we split the production probability in interaction types `` it '' .",
    "the function @xmath23 describes the distribution ( as a function of parent and daughter energy ) of daughter particles of type @xmath15 per final state energy interval @xmath24 .",
    "this function can be non - trivial .",
    "it contains the kinematics of the decay process , _ i.e. _ , the energy distribution of the discussed daughter particle , other species , we are not interested in , are typically integrated out . if more than one daughter particle of the same species @xmath15 is produced , or less than one ( in average ) because of other branchings , it must also give the number of daughter particles per event as a function of energy , which is often called `` multiplicity '' .",
    "note that the decay can be calculated in different frames , such as the parent rest frame ( prf ) , in the center of mass frame of the parents ( cmf ) , or in the shock rest frame ( srf ) , typically used to describe shock accelerated particles ( such as from fermi shock acceleration ) in astrophysical environments .",
    "however , the cross sections , entering the interaction rate @xmath25 , are often given in a particular frame , which has to be properly included .",
    "in addition , note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are typically given per volume , but here this choice is arbitrary since it enters on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ equ : prod ] ) .",
    "sometimes it is useful to consider the interaction or decay chain @xmath28 without being interested in @xmath15 , for instance , for the decay chain @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", one can integrate out @xmath15 .",
    "this approach has , for instance , been used in @xcite for obtaining the neutrino spectra .",
    "note , however , that the parent particles @xmath17 or @xmath15 may lose energy before they interact or decay , such as by synchrotron radiation .",
    "we do not treat such energy losses in this study explicitely , but we provide a framework to include them , such as in a steady state or time - dependent model for each particle species .    in meson photoproduction , a similar mechanism can be used .",
    "the interaction rate eq .  ( [ equ : prod ] ) can be interpreted in terms of the incident protons ( or neutrons ) because of the much higher energies in the srf , _",
    "i.e. _ , the species @xmath17 is identified with the proton or neutron , which we further on abbreviate with @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( for proton or neutron ) . in this case",
    ", the interaction rate depends on the interaction partner , the photon , as @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the photon density as a function of photon energy @xmath34 and the angle between the photon and proton momenta @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the photon production cross section , and @xmath37 is the photon energy in the nucleon / parent rest frame ( prf ) in the limit @xmath38 . the interaction itself , and therefore @xmath39 and @xmath34 , is described in the srf .",
    "the daughter particles @xmath15 are typically @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , or kaons .",
    "if intermediate resonances are produced , we integrate them out so that only pions ( kaons ) and protons or neutrons remain as the final states .    in the following",
    ", we will assume isotropy @xmath40 of the photon distribution .",
    "this limits this specific model to scenarios where we have seed photons produced in the shock rest frame ( _ i.e. _ , synchrotron emission ) .",
    "the other interesting case , where thermal photons are coming from outside the shock , may be easily implemented as well when the shock speed is high enough to assume delta - peaked angular distributions .",
    "arbitrary angular distributions would require additional integrations .",
    "assuming that the photon distribution is isotropic , the integral over @xmath41 can be replaced by one over @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the threshold below which the cross sections are zero .",
    "note that @xmath42 corresponds to the available center of mass energy @xmath45 of the interaction as @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : pgamma2 ] ) , the integral over @xmath42 takes into account that the proton and photon may hit each other in different directions . in the most optimistic case , @xmath47 ( head - on hit ) , whereas in the most pessimistic case , @xmath48 ( photon and proton travel in same direction ) .",
    "it should be noted that the assumption of isotropy here is limiting the model to internally produced photon fields .",
    "this could be lifted for different angular distributions , but except for the case of uni - directional photons this would require one more integration .    in general , the function @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : prod ] ) is a non - trivial function of two variables @xmath22 and @xmath16 . for photo - meson production in the srf ,",
    "the energy of the target photons is typically much smaller than the incident nucleon energy , and @xmath49 . in this case , , where @xmath30 is some parameterized probability distribution function of arbitrary shape and the parameters @xmath50 only depend on the initial state .",

    "the function @xmath54 describes how many daughter particles are produced at this energy in average . for our purposes",
    ", it will typically be a constant number which depends on interaction type and species @xmath15 ( if it changes at a certain threshold , one can define different interaction types below and above the threshold ) . for the relationship between @xmath53 and the inelasticity @xmath55 ( fractional energy loss of the initial nucleon ) , see app .",

    "the kinematics of more complicated interactions , such as direct production or multi - pion production , has been simulated by the introduction of multiple interaction types for each production channel . in a step - by - step fashion",

    "of course , some effort has to be spent to find a suitable parameterization for each process .",
    "we have demonstrated that our results match the output of sophia sufficiently well . however , there are some differences due to the more refined kinematics treatment of sophia , which effectively corresponds to one additional integration . for example , for very narrow spectral features , such as rapid cutoffs ,",
    "the spectra are naturally more smeared out by sophia .",
    "this is especially the case for high energetic interactions where multi - pion production is dominant , as can be seen in the bb ( black body ) benchmark .",

    "_ , app .",
    "[ app : sophia ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have included the spin state of the final muon in the pion decays , as described in @xcite , not included in sophia , which leads to differences in the neutrino flavor ratios : in fact , the electron to muon neutrino flavor ratio at the source is typically larger than 0.5 , instead of smaller , as predicted without taking into account the spin state . in particular , we obtain @xmath201 @xmath202 for the grb benchmark , @xmath203 for the agn benchmark , and up to @xmath204 for the bb benchmark close to the spectral peaks .",
    "this means that especially the agn benchmark behaves as pion beam in spite of the helicity dependence of the muon decays , whereas the bb benchmark shows the strongest deviation .",
    "since our approach has allowed us to discuss the leading interaction types separately , we have also shown the differences to the @xmath3-resonance approximation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for example , we have shown how multi - pion production modifies the characteristic shape of the grb neutrino spectrum expected from the resonance approximation ( which is flat in @xmath205 times the flux in the intermediate energy range ) .",
    "in fact , all of the the resonances combined do not dominate in any significant part of the charged pion spectrum for our grb , agn and bb benchmarks .",
    "in addition , the @xmath3-resonance approximation has rendered insufficient for the computation of the ( electron ) neutrino - antineutrino ratios at the source , because , by definition , no @xmath2 are produced .",
    "we have also demonstrated from our general response function in model sim - b , that for any input proton or photon spectrum the @xmath167 ratio at the source is significantly larger than one , as opposed to 1/2 from the @xmath3-resonance approximation .",
    "this implies that any neutrino flux based on the @xmath3-resonance approximation and normalized to photon flux observations using the charged to neutral pion ratio is underestimated by at least a factor of @xmath206 , where this factor is independent of the input spectra .",
    "we conclude that our simplified model sim - b allows for an efficient computation of pion and neutrino fluxes , including the necessary features for neutrino flux ratio discussion and the necessary efficiency for time - dependent simulations .",
    "it is sufficient for many purposes especially for power law photon fields , but , of course , it can not replace a full monte carlo simulation including full kinematics if high precision fits of existing data are required .",
    "in particular , it may turn out to be useful for time - dependent simulations and extensive parameter space studies using power law spectra , including spectral breaks .",
