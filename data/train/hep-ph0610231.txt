    "some years ago it was recognized that the measurements of @xmath3 for leptons ( commonly referred to as the lepton anomaly ) can be an interesting window to discover new physic beyond the standard model .",
    "the recent theoretical results for the electron anomaly are now known at order @xmath4 @xcite in its qed contribution and at two - loops for the electroweak corrections @xcite for the muon anomaly .",
    "the present values are : @xmath5 for the electron and @xmath6 for the muon .",
    "in fact , the results reported by the muon @xmath7 collaboration @xcite combined with the most recent theoretical calculations have shown that there remains a discrepancy with the sm theoretical calculations at a confidence level from @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xmath10 , according to the values chosen for the hadronic contributions .",
    "using @xmath11 data , the sm prediction for the muon @xmath12 deviates from the present experimental value @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite by @xmath13 , if the hadronic light - by - light contribution is used instead of the hadronic @xmath14 decay data . among all contributions yielding corrections to the muon anomaly ,",
    "the hadronic contributions are less accurate due to the hadronic vacuum polarization effects in the diagrams which use data inputs coming from the @xmath15 annihilation cross section and the hadronic @xmath16 decay .",
    "it is not clear at present whether the value from @xmath16 decay data can be improved much further due to the difficulty in evaluating more precisely the effect of isospin breaking .",
    "in fact , these measurements have provided the highest accuracy for the predictions of theories for strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions because they have reached a fabulous relative precision of 0.5 parts per million ( ppm ) in the determination of @xmath17 . however , if this discrepancy for the muon anomaly remains , it is possible that we are under a window open for new physics at a high energy scale , @xmath18 the study of the muon anomaly becomes relevant because it is more sensitive to interactions that are not predicted in the sm but that can be reached at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) with @xmath19 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "if we take into account the effects of virtual massive particles in the diagrams contributing to the lepton anomaly , the corrections to the anomalies are expected to be of the order @xmath20 for the muon , and of the order @xmath21 for the tau .",
    "the same huge enhancement factor would also affect the contributions coming from degrees of freedom beyond the sm , so that the measurement of the @xmath16 anomaly would represent the best opportunity to detect new physics .",
    "unfortunately , the very short lifetime of the @xmath14- lepton which , precisely because of its high mass , can also decay into hadronic states , makes such a measurement impossible at present .",
    "this is the reason for the emphasis on the muon anomaly .",
    "many models beyond the standard model have been proposed in order to explain the discrepancy of the muon @xmath12 .",
    "this is the case for example in @xmath22 gut models @xcite@xcite , supersymmetry @xcite and left - right ( l - r ) models with mirror fermions @xcite . for a review of models for new physic see ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have studied a left - right symmetric model with mirror fermions in the @xmath23 context using a minimal set of higgs fields that consists in two doublets and two singlets .",
    "one essential ingredient in our model is the incorporation of @xmath24parity to induce the breaking of @xmath25 through the vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . ) of an odd higgs relative to @xmath26parity @xcite .",
    "we expect that the breaking scale of @xmath25 will be not very far from the electroweak scale , let us say @xmath27 @xmath28 due to introduction of an even @xmath26parity higgs singlet which gain a v.e.v . in the gut scale before the @xmath26parity odd higgs .",
    "our paper is organized as follow . in section 2",
    "we introduce our left - right symmetrical model with mirror fermions based in a @xmath23 gut . in section 3",
    "we study the higgs sector and its interactions with charged leptons that is relevant for the lepton anomaly and its radiative mass . in section 4",
    "we analyze the constraints on the relevant parameters of the model . in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "left - right symmetric models are expected to be a natural consequence of @xmath29 this extension of the standard model is also expected to be a sub - group of some grand unified model .",
    "the fermionic content of the fundamental representations can vary , but an economical choice consists of mirror fermions , related by a parity symmetry .",
    "mirror fermions are suggested for example in @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 @xcite @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite unifications models , as well as direct product group such as @xmath35 @xcite .    in the l - r model with mirror fermions the particle content",

    "there are two ways of breaking parity spontaneously : the first is to identify the discrete symmetry @xmath92 that interchanges the groups @xmath93  and @xmath25 of the lorentz group @xmath94 as the parity operator @xmath95 , which allows the parity symmetry of the higgs bosons to be @xmath96 and also @xmath97 .",
    "thus , when @xmath25 is broken in the symmetric l - r model , parity is also broken . the second possibility for",
    "a spontaneously breaking of the parity symmetry is through the v.e.v . of an odd scalar field that conserves the l - r symmetry . in this case",
    "it is not possible to have @xmath98 if in the model there are complex yukawa couplings .",
    "this type of parity is called @xmath1-parity which is a generator of groups that contain the product @xmath99 as a subgroup .",
    "this second possibility is very important because allow @xmath100 with different coupling constants for @xmath93 and @xmath25 and different masses for these higgs fields .",
    "our model for the scalar potential includes two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets .",
    "these singlets and doublets transforms under @xmath1-parity as @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , if in the model there is no cp violation or complex yukawa couplings . in this case",
    ", @xmath104 and @xmath1-parity can be indistinctly considered .",
    "let us suppose the following invariant potential under @xmath105 for the higgs fields @xmath106 our motivation to write this potential is the fact that @xmath62 and @xmath61 are not necessarily into the same irreducible multiplet of higgs fields . in consequence",
    "it is also possible a mixing between these fields .",
    "if this is the case , when @xmath107  and @xmath108 the potential responsible for the higgs masses for the fields @xmath109 and @xmath110  is @xmath111 from which we find the mass terms , @xmath112 now we impose the hierarchy condition in the previous equations such that @xmath113 @xmath114 . in this limit",
    "we can now have @xmath115 and , let us say ; @xmath116 it is necessary to indicate that @xmath117 breaks the electroweak symmetry and @xmath118 breaks the l - r symmetry close to the tev scale .",
    "it also must be noted that if @xmath61  and @xmath62 are into the same multiplet , the mixing terms in the potential possibility will be absent .",
    "let us now suppose that there is no cp violation and that all v.e.v .",
    "are considered to be real : @xmath119 @xmath120 then it is possible to show that the minimum conditions for the potential are given by @xmath121=0,\\ \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\\upsilon_{r}}=2\\upsilon_{r}[\\mu^{2}-2\\lambda_{\\chi } ( \\upsilon_{l}^{2}+\\upsilon_{r}^{2})+m_{d}s_{d}+m_{m}s_{m}+\\lambda s_{d } s_{m}+\\nonumber\\\\ \\varepsilon_{d}s_{d}^{2}+\\varepsilon_{m}s_{m}^{2}-4\\varkappa\\upsilon_{r } ^{2}]=0,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] from these equations we have @xmath122=0\\ ] ] as we require non trivial solutions",
    "so that @xmath123 @xmath124 we obtain the desired hierarchy @xmath125 an important point to be noted in the previous equation is that the effect of the breaking due to the singlet @xmath62 is sub - dominant with relation to @xmath61 which breaks @xmath1-parity when @xmath126 .",
    "additionally , if @xmath127 the @xmath1-parity is conserved and also the l - r symmetry  producing @xmath128 as expected .",
    "thus , we have shown that in our potential there is a possibility to construct models producing an hierarchy between the breaking scale of @xmath25 and the electroweak scale simply by using two higgs singlets to generate the minimum of the potential . the crucial point in this sense",
    "is the inclusion of the mixing term @xmath129 which is possible if @xmath130 and @xmath61 are into different irreducible representations . in the same way as in the previous term ,",
    "also the term @xmath131 breaks the l - r symmetry .",
    "it is fundamental also to fine tune the parameters of the model at the radiative level to assure that @xmath118 do not destabilizes the @xmath117 value .",
    "thus , from equations ( 12 ) - ( 15 ) we must have @xmath132      an interesting model with mirror fermions based in the gauge group @xmath134 with a minimal set of higgs fields was elaborated in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is constructed using two higgs doublets @xmath135 that satisfy the parity transformation @xmath136 , and two higgs singlets , the first of which is coupled to dirac terms - @xmath61 - and the other that couples to majorana terms - @xmath62 .",

    "@xcite@xcite with only two doublets the minimum for the vacuum appear at @xmath137 which is phenomenologically useless .",
    "it has also been shown by using a variational method @xcite that this vacuum is unstable and that @xmath117 could gain a small value , in comparison to @xmath138 when higgs fields are coupled to fermion fields .",
    "the other possible solution is the inclusion of bi - doublets , increasing the number of fundamental parameters in the scalar sector . in the present approach , with two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets ,",
