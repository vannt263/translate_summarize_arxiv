    "the nucleon vector strange form factors , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , characterize the contribution of the strange sea quarks to the nucleon electromagnetic form factors , and thereby their contribution to the charge and magnetization distributions in the nucleon . with polarized electron facilities , @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be accessed by measuring the pv asymmetries in elastic @xmath9-@xmath10 scattering , quasielastic @xmath9-@xmath11 scattering , and elastic @xmath9-@xmath12he scattering  @xcite . in very general terms , the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath13 can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the `` non - vector - strange '' asymmetry ( independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are functions of kinematic quantities , nucleon electromagnetic form factors , and nuclear models ( for non - hydrogen targets ) .    for elastic e@xmath18p scattering , the full form of the asymmetry is  @xcite @xmath19}\\\\ \\nonumber & \\times \\{\\displaystyle ( \\epsilon(g_e^{p})^2 + \\tau(g_m^{p})^2)(1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta_w)(1+r_v^p)\\\\ \\nonumber & \\quad -(\\epsilon g_e^p g_e^n + \\tau g_m^p g_m^n)(1+r_v^n)\\\\ \\nonumber & \\quad -(\\epsilon",

    "[ eq_apv_full2 ] , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fermi and fine structure constants , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is the four momentum transfer .",
    "@xmath25 are the proton and neutron electric and magnetic form factors , while @xmath26 is proton axial form factor seen by an electron . in order to extract contributions from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , one must include the effects of standard model ( sm ) @xmath29 electroweak radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "it is often useful to characterize these corrections in terms of ratios @xmath30 of the @xmath29 hadronic vector ( @xmath31 ) and axial vector ( @xmath32 ) weak neutral current amplitudes to the corresponding tree - level amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 give these ratios for vector proton , neutron , and su(3)-singlet amplitudes , respectively . in principle , their values can be obtained using the sm predictions for the effective electron - quark couplings @xmath36 given in @xcite .",
    "however , the quoted @xmath36 do not include perturbative qcd contributions or coherent strong interaction effects in the radiative corrections associated with elastic scattering from a nucleon .",
    "a recent analysis of these effects has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite and up - dated in ref .",
    "the latter work also gives an improved treatment of strong interaction contributions to the running of the weak mixing angle in the @xmath37 renormalization scheme from its value at the @xmath38-pole , @xmath39 , to the quantity appropriate for precise , low - energy neutral current experiments , @xmath40 .",
    "all of these effects are included in the @xmath41 given in table [ tab_ana_prms ] .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in @xmath42 and @xmath35 are less than one percent and have a negligible impact on our analysis , so we do not quote these errors in table [ tab_ana_prms ] .",
    "the theoretical error in @xmath43 is @xmath44 @xcite , or slightly more than one percent .",
    "since this error receives roughly equal contributions from the uncertainty in @xmath45 and from the @xmath29 @xmath46 box graph corrections , it is not appropriate to quote an uncertainty in @xmath33 alone .",
    "the uncertainties associated with other strong interaction effects are sub - dominant . for the kinematic range of the pv experiments analyzed here",
    ", the @xmath41 have a negligible impact on the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath47 and are taken to be constant .",
    "we use the conventional @xmath37 renormalization scheme .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 in eqn .",

    "the values of @xmath24 , @xmath49 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 , @xmath50 are taken directly from @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 , and @xmath35 are converted from @xmath36 parameters in @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 is derived from the proton weak charge given in ref .",
    "we adopt the value and uncertainty of @xmath51 from @xcite , @xmath52 from @xcite , and @xmath53 from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "several observations can be made from the table .",
    "first , compared to the first order fits , the additional free parameter @xmath54 does not improve the fit quality significantly .",
    "reasonable fits can be obtained up to @xmath0 of 0.210  ( gev / c)@xmath55 , beyond which the `` flexibility '' of our fit model again seems to be inadequate to describe the data .",
    "second , the best values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are very similar to those obtained from the first order fit ( table  [ tab_fit_class1 ] ) .",
    "third , the uncertainties of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as compared to those from the first order fit , are slightly larger due to the additional parameter @xmath54 .",
    "fourth , if we ignore the fit quality , and simply examine the mean and uncertainty of @xmath54 , it is large and uncertain until the fit range goes up to 0.262  ( gev / c)@xmath55 .",
    "this is expected , since it is difficult to determine the slope parameter with insufficient `` lever arm '' .",
    "also , fits beyond 0.262  ( gev / c)@xmath55 suggests a gentle @xmath54 .",
    "( to illustrate this point , in the last row in table  [ tab_fit_class3 ] we show the fit results by using only the low @xmath0 ( @xmath560.11  ( gev / c)@xmath55 ) and happex-99 data , which yield a consistent picture as described above . ) however , the fit quality for @xmath57  0.210  ( gev / c)@xmath55 prevents us from making a strong statement about @xmath54 here .    for completeness , we also investigated the impact of including a @xmath58 term in @xmath7 ( corresponding to chiral order @xmath59 ) .",
    "the resulting fit quality does not improve substantially with the inclusion of data with @xmath0 beyond @xmath600.2  ( gev / c)@xmath55 , and both second order parameters in the form factors are poorly constrained",
    ". nevertheless , the resulting @xmath27 are consistent with those obtained above .",
    "based on these considerations , we choose to use the first order fit up to @xmath610.164 ( table  [ tab_fit_class1 ] ) as our final results in this analysis : @xmath62 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath63 between the two , and @xmath64 .",
    "again , the uncertainties of the two form factors are marginalized 1@xmath65 uncertainties corresponding to the projections of @xmath66 contour .",
    "this result is in good agreement with eqn .",
    "[ eq_bestfit_band ] , for which only the lowest three @xmath0 bins of @xmath67 data were included . for @xmath8 alone , the one - side confidence integral for a negative @xmath8 ( @xmath68 $ ] ) is 12.3% .",
    "a combined analysis of the world pv electron scattering data has been performed to extract the nucleon strange electric and magnetic form factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath69  ( gev / c)@xmath55 .",
    "our treatment is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but utilizes all available low @xmath0 data including the recent happex results  @xcite and incorporates the uncertainties in the electromagnetic and axial form factors .",
    "we find that the agreement among different measurements is good and we obtain fits with acceptable @xmath70 .",
    "using a simple parametrization of the @xmath0 variation in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a satisfactory global fit can be obtained up to a @xmath71  ( gev / c)@xmath55 . at @xmath72  ( gev / c)@xmath55 ,",
    "the confidence integral for @xmath73 is 12.3% , so substantially negative values of @xmath8 are highly disfavored by the fit .",
    "in addition , our best fit is consistent with @xmath74 at @xmath0=0.1  ( gev / c)@xmath55 .",
