    "phase field models are an important numerical technique for capturing the growth of micro - structures  @xcite and can be used to model various solidification processes such as that of a binary alloy  @xcite . instead of explicitly tracking the solid - liquid interface , an order parameter is introduced that varies continuously over a thin transition layer , which approximates a sharp solid interface with a diffuse one . using this approach ,",
    "boundary conditions at the interface can be replaced by localized body - force terms , simplifying the conservation equations that govern the order parameter .",
    "even though the term  phase field \" was coined much later , the basic idea has been in existence since the 1800s when van der walls studied fluid interfaces using a density field  @xcite .",
    "phase field models have also been used to study many physical applications including defects  @xcite , deformations  @xcite , and the growth of dendrites  @xcite .",
    "a variety of numerical methods have been employed , includes finite differences  @xcite , finite elements  @xcite , and spectral methods  @xcite .",
    "one well known conservative method to capture phase dynamics is the cahn - hilliard model .",
    "the original purpose of this model was to investigate the phase transition of binary alloys  @xcite and has been used to model the phase dynamics of polymers and ceramics  @xcite , thermo - capillary flows  @xcite , the rayleigh - taylor instability  @xcite , droplet breakup  @xcite , liquid - liquid jets pinching off  @xcite , multicomponent lipid vesicles  @xcite , and for the tracking of tumor growth  @xcite .    solving the cahn - hillard equation on a curved surfaces",
    "is a difficult task for a number of reasons .",
    "it is a fourth order partial differential equation which is numerically stiff , requiring small time steps for stability . in this work ,",
    "the fourth - order pde is split into a set of coupled second - order differential equations .",
    "the underlying surface differential operators are discretized using the closest - point method  @xcite .",
    "a numerical convergence analysis is presented based on a manufactured solution while a qualitative spatial analysis is also shown to demonstrate that small changes early in the evolution of the phase field can lead to large changes in the final domain location .",
    "consider a closed interface @xmath0 with an outward facing normal @xmath1 .",
    "the non - dimensional surface cahn - hilliard equations describe the temporal evolution of an order parameter @xmath2 on the surface @xmath0 , where the evolution is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the surface gradient operator , @xmath5 is the mobility , and @xmath6 is the surface peclet number which relates the strength of any surface advection to diffusion .",
    "the chemical potential , @xmath7 , is the variational derivative of the surface free energy , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is often taken as a double well potential and @xmath10 is the cahn number , which indicates the strength of the energy penalty associated with surface boundaries  @xcite .",
    "this results in the following expression for the chemical potential , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the surface laplacian operator . using the chemical potential expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ch_continuity ] ) results in a fourth - order evolution equation for the phase field .",
    "assume that the mobility is constant and equal to 1 and that the equations are discretized on a standard cartesian grid using finite difference approximations .",
    "let the interface be described by a level set jet scheme  @xcite .",
    "the cahn - hilliard system can be written as a pair of coupled , second - order differential equations  @xcite , @xmath13 discretizing this in time the system can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the solutions at times @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , with @xmath19 a constant time step .",

    "the basic idea is to extend the solution away from the interface such that it is constant in the normal direction . with this extension ,",
    "it is possible to write a surface differential equation as a standard differential equation in the embedding space .",
    "let @xmath32 be a linear polynomial interpolation operator and @xmath33 be a cubic polynomial interpolation operator .",

    "in this section both quantitative and qualitative convergence results are presented .",

    "a wide number of different interface descriptions could be used .",
    "first consider the quantitative convergence of the method using a manufactured solution .",
    "the solution is taken to be @xmath49 , which is a scaled real @xmath50 spherical harmonic .",
    "this leads to a chemical potential of @xmath51 and a mixing energy of @xmath52 .",
    "for the quantitative study the parameters are set to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the time step is varied from @xmath55 to @xmath56 for the grid sizes that varied from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "all errors are computed as @xmath59-errors at a time of @xmath60 .",
    ".grid convergence results are presented using the methods of manufactured solutions using bdf2 .",
    "errors in the phase field and chemical potential at time of t=0.5 are shown using time step of @xmath61 .",
    "it is found to be second order accurate in space , as expected . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the errors for both the bdf1 and bdf2 schemes as a function of time step for various grid spacings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeconv ] .",
    "several items become apparent from this figure .",
    "first , at large time steps the first - order scheme converges at the expected rate .",
    "the second - order scheme appears to converge at the expected rate , but this convergence only occurs for a small time step window before reaching a steady - state value .",
    "second , it is observed that for a given grid size at sufficiently small time steps the error becomes constant .",
    "in fact , both the first- and second - order in time schemes have the same error at small time steps .",
    "this behavior can be explained by considering the expected error . due to the interpolation operators this solver is similar to those used for semi - lagrangian methods .",
    "specifically , it should be expected that the error should obey @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the order of time discretization , @xmath64 is the accuracy order of derivative approximations , and @xmath65 is the order of the interpolant  @xcite . it should be expected that as the time - discretization errors decrease for a fixed grid spacing the overall error should be dominated by the interpolation error , @xmath66 . it is interesting to note that the error for this particular solution does not increase with decreasing time step , but remains constant .",
    "the reason for this is not known and would require further investigation .",
    "the errors using @xmath67 with the bdf2 scheme are shown in table [ table : gridconv ] . at this time",
    "step the error is dominated by the grid spacing .",
    "as demonstrated , the spatial convergence is approximately second - order for both the phase field and chemical potential .",
    "next consider the qualitative convergence of the cahn - hilliard system .",
    "the cahn - hilliard system is solved on a unit sphere with a random initial concentration .",
    "the chemical potential in this case the a simple double - well potential , @xmath68 . to ensure the conservation of the phase field over long simulation times",
    "the correction of xu , li , lowengrub , and zhao has been implemented  @xcite .    to ensure that the initial condition is the same across all grid sizes , a random initial concentration which spans @xmath69 $ ]",
    "is created on the @xmath57 grid and is then interpolated using a spline interpolant to the finer meshes .",
    "the time step is fixed at @xmath70 and the bdf2 scheme is used .",
    "the other parameters in this study are @xmath71 and @xmath54 .    the results for various times can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qualresults ] .",
    "the initial homogeneous phase quickly segregates , as seen at t=@xmath72 , into connected serpentine - like domains .",
    "after segregation the domains start to slowly coarsen in time .",
    "the large domains grow larger in size at the expense of the smaller domains . from fig .",
    "[ fig : qualresults ] , it can be seen that the solution on the grid size of @xmath57 starts to differ at a time of @xmath73 , where one serpentine domain pinches off . from this point",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath57-grid differs from the finer meshes , which all demonstrate similar behavior .",
    "this can be further seen by comparing the steady - state domains of the @xmath57 and @xmath74 grids at a time of 65 , fig .",
