    "divergent properties of a system near its critical point are usually characterized by the critical exponents @xcite , describing the dependence of macroscopic quantities on the deviation from the critical point .",
    "for example , at a distance @xmath1 from the critical point , the order parameter @xmath2 behaves as @xmath3 , the correlation length @xmath4 as @xmath5 , and the correlation time @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the static exponents and @xmath9 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "although the number of microscopic degrees of freedom is huge , the number of independent critical exponents is small , as these critical exponents satisfy several scaling laws .",
    "whether the power laws with the several exponents are enough to describe universal critical properties is an interesting and fundamental question in both classical @xcite and quantum phase transitions @xcite .    in this paper , we study the relaxation quantum critical dynamics .",
    "theoretical studies on the quantum critical dynamics have been partly stimulated by developments in experimental technologies @xcite , which provide effective platforms to manipulate quantum many - body systems and detect their nonequilibrium quantum phenomena .",
    "although a lot of effort has been devoted to understanding the universal dynamic properties @xcite , long - range entanglement and nonequilibrium nature make this issue difficult to tackle in both analytical and numerical aspects @xcite .    in classical critical dynamics",
    "@xcite , the dynamic exponent and the static ones are decoupled . in quantum case",
    ", it is well known that there is a mapping between a @xmath10-dimensional quantum system and a corresponding @xmath11-dimensional classical system .",
    "the additional dimension comes from the inverse of the temperature , and plays the role of the imaginary time .",
    "as the imaginary time has an identical dimension to the real time , parts of the dynamic and static critical properties are intimately intertwined in quantum critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , hyperscaling scaling laws in quantum criticality include the dynamic exponent @xmath9 and the static ones together @xcite .",
    "so , besides the usual static critical exponents and the dynamic one , it is believed that no additional exponent is necessary in quantum critical dynamics , compared to the equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "a typical example is the driving quantum critical dynamics , in which the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite and the finite - time scaling theory @xcite show that nonequilibrium critical properties are well described by the exponents in the equilibrium quantum critical phenomena , even at finite temperatures @xcite .",

    "we suggest that a universal characteristic function @xmath26 can be introduced , as in the classical case @xcite , to characterize the behavior of an arbitrary initial parameter @xmath0 under the scale transformation .",

    "in classical short - time critical dynamics , a universal characteristic function has been proposed to describe the rescaled initial order parameter in the scale transformation characterizing evolution with an arbitrary initial magnetization @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we suggest a similar scale transformation which contains a universal characteristic function to describe the imaginary - time evolution starting with an arbitrary initial magnetization in quantum critical dynamics .",
    "universal behavior near the quantum critical point is controlled by the low - lying energy levels . because of the dissipative nature of eq .",
    "( [ scheq ] ) , when a quantum system is quenched to the vicinity of its critical point , contributions from the high - energy levels decay fast in the microscopic initial stage . after this stage",
    ", the critical system enters the universal short - time stage . for both very small @xmath0 and the saturated @xmath0 , previous studies @xcite have shown that a scaling form connects the scaling behavior in this stage to that in the long - time stage .",
