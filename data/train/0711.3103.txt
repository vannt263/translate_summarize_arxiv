    "driven diffusive systems play an important role in statistical physics .",
    "they not only serve as paradigm for non - equilibrium behaviour @xcite , but also as models for transport processes like vehicular traffic @xcite , granular flow through narrow pipes @xcite and biological transport by motor proteins @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these models is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) which was first introduced to describe protein polymerization in ribosomes @xcite ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the tasep exhibits some generic properties like _ boundary induced phase transitions _ @xcite that also occur in more complex driven systems .",
    "it was solved exactly @xcite and results can be used for qualitative and quantitative approaches to other systems .",
    "the phase diagram consists of three phases ( high density ( h ) , low density ( l ) , and maximum current phase ( m ) ) , depending on whether the current is limited by the particle input , output or the transport capacity of the bulk , and is generic for a large class of driven diffusive systems @xcite .",
    "while homogeneous systems are extensively investigated , systems with inhomogeneous transition rates are not that well understood , especially for the case of open boundary conditions .",
    "it is well - known that in nonequilibrium systems even weak disorder can lead to drastic changes @xcite . for driven diffusive systems already a single _ defect site _ , i.e.  a site with reduced hopping rate , can have a global effect on the stationary state , see e.g.  @xcite for the case of the tasep with periodic boundary conditions . here",
    "it was shown that in an intermediate density regime @xmath0 the current becomes density - independent , i.e.  the flow - density relation ( fundamental diagram ) exhibits a plateau .",
    "in contrast , in the limits of low and high densities , the current is unchanged by the presence of the defect .",
    "here we consider the tasep with open boundaries in the presence of a _ bottleneck _ of length @xmath1 , i.e.  a sequence of @xmath1 consecutive `` slow '' bonds corresponds to a single _ defect_. ] , where the hopping rate of the particles is reduced compared to the rest of the system .",
    "we will study the effect of such bottlenecks on the phase diagram of the tasep , focussing on the _ maximal current _ that can be maintained by the system through optimization of the input and output rates , i.e.  its _ transport capacity_.    in open systems , the main effect of the bottleneck ( or defects in general ) is a decrease of the transport capacity @xcite .",
    "this leads to an enlarged maximum current phase compared to the pure system .",
    "in addition the density profiles in the maximum current phase exhibit phase separation into a high density and low density regime separated by a shock .    the effect of defects in systems with open boundaries has been studied earlier by several authors .",
    "so far no exact solutions are known and one has to rely on computer simulations with monte carlo ( mc ) methods and mean - field type approximations .",
    "kolomeisky @xcite investigated the tasep in the presence of a single defect site ( @xmath2 ) deep in the bulk .",
    "analytical results are obtained by a mean field approach which neglects correlations on the slow bond by dividing the system into two homogeneous ones coupled at the defect site .",
    "therefore this approach is limited to single defect sites ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "comparison with mc results shows a good agreement , at least for the high- and low - density phases .",
    "the mean field treatment also leads to deviations of density profiles near the defect site from the mc results .    in @xcite , chou and",
    "lakatos gave an analytical approach treating a finite number of bottlenecks of arbitrary lengths .",
    "their _ finite segment mean field theory ( fsmft ) _ divides the system into segments which contain one or a few defect sites . by determining the leading eigenvector of the corresponding transition matrix and matching the currents of the different subsystems , predictions for the current through the system",
    "are obtained which at the same time take into account correlations near the bottlenecks .",
    "although the method allows to treat several defect sites of arbitrary hopping rates within the segment , it is restricted to segment lengths of less than 20 sites due to the numerical complexity .",
    "the results for one and two defect sites ( @xmath2 ) in the bulk were recently extended by dong et al .",
    "additionally they have considered the case where a single defect is located near the boundary of the system and found an _ edge effect _ induced by the interaction of this defect with the boundary .",
    "this implies a dependence of the current on the position of the defect .",
    "finally , the effects of langmuir kinetics , i.e.  particle - creation and -annihilation in the bulk have been shown @xcite to lead to a rich phase diagram including novel phases .",
    "the present investigation generalizes the previous works in several aspects .",
    "especially we will study systematically the dependence of the current on the length @xmath1 of the bottleneck and its position . for this purpose",
    "we develop an analytical approach to calculate the current and critical boundary rates , called the _ interacting subsystem approximation ( isa)_. mathematically it requires finding a specific root , constrained by physical requirements , of a polynomial which has a degree of order @xmath1 . for longer bottlenecks this approach is more efficient than the approach of @xcite which demands to search an eigenvector of a @xmath3-matrix",
    "this allows us to generalize the single defect results of dong et al .",
    "@xcite to longer bottlenecks .",
    "the increase of the maximum current by moving defects near the boundary is reproduced by isa and extended to the case @xmath4 ( _ positive edge effect _ ) . however , for lower entry rates isa predicts a decrease of the current ( _ negative edge effect _ ) which is confirmed by mc simulations .",
    "we also observe in mc simulations an intermediate regime which shows a non - monotonic dependence of the current on the position of the bottleneck .",
    "furthermore we conclude that for bottlenecks near the boundaries there is no phase transition to a maximum current phase , since the current is not constant in any regime , but it approaches the maximum current asymptotically for higher entry and exit rates , and there is no macroscopic phase separation .",
    "we also consider the case of two bottlenecks of arbitrary lengths and separation generalizing the corresponding results of @xcite for two single defects .",
    "therefore we also investigate the case that one of the bottlenecks is near the boundaries .",
    "the results will motivate a concept of _ effective boundary rates _ that encompasses the effect of boundary - near bottlenecks .",
    "this provides the basis for an extensive study @xcite of finite defect densities , i.e.  a macroscopic number of slow bonds . here",
    "previous investigations for periodic @xcite and open systems @xcite have revealed surprising results .",
    "for the open system , for example , it has been found @xcite that the position of the phase transitions is sensitively sample - dependent even for large systems .",
    "we consider a tasep consisting of @xmath5 sites which can either be empty or occupied by one particle . throughout this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in the steady - state in the limit @xmath6 . with each bond between neighbouring sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 we associate a hopping rate @xmath9 which corresponds to the rate at which a particle will move from @xmath7 to its right neighbour @xmath8 if this is empty with sites @xmath7 .",
    "these site rates are related to the bond rates by @xmath10 .",
    "we will use both terminologies here . ] . at the boundary sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 particles can be inserted and removed , respectively . if site @xmath13 is empty a particle will be inserted there with rate @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "if site @xmath5 is occupied this particle will be removed with rate @xmath15 . here",
    "we will use a random - sequential update corresponding to continuous - time dynamics .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of a single bottleneck of length @xmath1 , i.e.  a section of @xmath1 consecutive slow bonds ( or sites ) with hopping rate @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - asepdef ] ) .",
    "all other bonds are fast bonds with hopping rate @xmath17 .    in order to determine relevant quantities like the current and critical boundary rates , we approach the problem by virtually dividing the system into three interacting subsystems ( fig .",
    "[ fig - asepdef ] ) : a system of @xmath18 sites with hopping rate @xmath19 at the left end of the chain , a section of length @xmath20 consisting of the bottleneck with @xmath1 slow sites ( hopping rate @xmath21 ) extending from site @xmath22 to site @xmath23 plus an extra fast site @xmath24 at the right end , and finally another pure system of length @xmath25 with hopping rates @xmath19 .",
    "note that subsystem 2 , which contains the bottleneck , starts and ends with a fast bond .",
    "this symmetry of the subsystem will be more convenient for our investigations .",
    "the main idea of our approach is to use the exact solution for the stationary state of the pure tasep with random - sequential dynamics @xcite .",
    "this solution applies to all three pure subsystems defined above .",
    "the interactions between these subsystems are described by suitably chosen boundary rates .",
    "we neglect correlations at the sites connecting the subsystems . introducing the occupation number @xmath26 of site",
    "@xmath7 , this explicitly means that we assume @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average local density at site @xmath7 .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to that of kolomeisky @xcite for the case of a single defect ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , there correlations on the slow bond are neglected whereas here we will treat the bottleneck also as a pure system ( of reduced hopping rate ) so that the most relevant correlations induced by it are taken into account .",
    "the three subsystems are coupled through virtual boundary rates @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "note that all these rates are associated with fast bonds . in the following",
    "we will call this approach the _ interacting subsystem approximation ( isa ) _ to distinguish it from the usual mean - field approach which neglects _ all _ correlations .",
    "the rate equations at the sites connecting the subsystems are then given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the virtual boundary rates @xmath33 in terms of the average local density @xmath34 .",
    "for completeness , we also define @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that the mean - field factorization of expectation values only applies to the sites at the boundaries of the subsystems .",
    "all correlations within the subsystems will be taken into account exactly !    from the exact solution of the tasep with @xmath37 sites for hopping rate @xmath38 , we know the `` partition function '' @xcite @xmath39 which is exact for all system sizes @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the probability of finding the stationary system in a configuration @xmath42 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath43 can be removed by taking the limit @xmath44 which yields the analytic continuation @xmath45    the corresponding results for the tasep with hopping rate @xmath46 can be obtained by rescaling of the boundary rates @xmath47 .",
    "thus the partition function in a pure tasep with hopping rate @xmath48 is @xmath49 this result will be used in the following for different values of @xmath37 , depending on the length of the subsystems .",
    "the exact current @xmath50 of a pure system of length @xmath37 , which is the quantity most relevant in the following , can be expressed through the partition function as  @xcite @xmath51    conservation of current then yields the central equations of the isa @xmath52 which express the fact that the current in the stationary state is the same in all three interacting subsystems .",
    "note that we have used ( [ zp(n ) ] ) and ( [ j(n ) ] ) to express the current in the bottleneck ( subsystem 2 ) through the result @xmath50 for a pure system .    inserting ( [ z(n ) ] ) and ( [ j(n ) ] ) in ( [ current_cons ] ) we obtain a set of two algebraic equations with six variables . in principle one",
    "can solve these equations , if four of the variables are known or more equations are given that determine variables .",
    "first we study the case where the bottleneck is _ far from the boundaries_. so we assume that @xmath18 and @xmath25 are large . from the latter condition",
    "it is expected that the topology of the phase diagram is the same as that of a system with a single defect ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we can therefore follow @xcite and classify the phases by the phases of the pure subsystems 1 and 3 which are @xmath53 .",
    "though at first glance one could expect nine possible phases corresponding to all possible combinations of three phases l , h , m ( see sec .  [ introduction ] ) that can be realized in the pure subsystems 1 and 3 , it was argued in @xcite that only the combinations l - l , h - h and h - l can exist .",
    "the l - l - phase corresponds to a global _ low density phase ( l ) _ , while h - h corresponds to a _",
    "high density phase ( h)_. in both cases , only around the bottleneck there are local deviations from the density profile of the homogeneous system . in the h - l - phase , we have phase separation which can not be observed in the pure system .",
    "the current in the h - phase is independent of the entry rate , while in the l - phase it is independent of the exit rate . thus in a phase separated h - l - phase , the current is independent of both boundary conditions and takes a maximum value ( see below ) .",
    "although it is sometimes called a _ maximum current phase ( m ) _ like in the pure system , its properties differ from the maximum current phase in the pure system not only by the occurrence of phase separation , but also by the absence of algebraic boundary layers .",
    "therefore we prefer the terminology _ phase separated regime _ ( ps ) .",
    "furthermore , the transition to this phase corresponds to a transition of subsystem 1 from l to h and vice versa respectively , which is accompanied by a discontinuity of the mean density @xmath54 . according to this ,",
    "it can be classified as a first order transition in contrast to the pure system where the transition to the maximum current phase is of second order .",
    "though the system with a bottleneck is not exactly invariant under the _ particle - hole symmetry operation _ defined by @xmath55 , this transformation only changes the position of the bottleneck , but still leaves it far from the boundary . thus the particle - hole transformation leaves the phases of the subsystems unchanged , since it only changes their sizes , but they stay @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the phase diagram must be symmetric with respect to the line @xmath56 .",
    "this symmetry constraint yields that the transition line between high and low density phase must be at @xmath56 .",
    "we now want to determine the critical entry rate @xmath57 at the transition from the l - phase to the ps - phase for fixed @xmath15 in terms of the analytical isa approach introduced in the last section .",
    "it corresponds to the transition of ( the pure ) subsystem  1 from low to high density phase which occurs at @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore we know that at this point @xmath59 .",
    "subsystem 3 still remains in the low density phase .",
    "therefore we also have @xmath60 .",
    "since the current must be the same as in subystem 1 and @xmath61 must be smaller than 1/2 we conclude @xmath62 . from the definition of the virtual boundary rates ( [ bound_rates1 ] ) , ( [ def_bound_rates ] ) we obtain by a simple transformation @xmath63 where",
    "the first equality in each equation can be found e.g.  in @xcite . from the exact solution of the pure tasep ( [ j(n ) ] ) , ( [ z(n ) ] ) and the conservation of current ( [ current_cons ] ) , it follows @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the limit defined in ( [ z(n)2 ] ) and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",

    "the requirement that a physical relevant solution for @xmath57 has to be in the interval @xmath69 $ ] gives a unique solution @xmath70 for the transition point to the ps - phase .",
    "in general , the solution depends on the length @xmath1 of the bottleneck and the slow hopping rate @xmath21 . for @xmath2 , for example , equation ( [ a*-equ ] ) can be transformed into @xmath71 the relevant solution is then @xmath72 explicitly , for the value @xmath73 used in most simulations , one obtains @xmath74 by evaluating ( [ a*(l=1 ) ] ) .",

    "nonetheless , as we can also see in the figures , the magnitude of the positive and the mixed edge effect is much smaller than the one of the negative edge effect .",
    "the isa results obtained from the equations in the last subsection confirm the existence of negative and positive edge effect , while the mixed one is not .",
    "this indicates that the mixed edge effect is caused by correlations at the edge of the bottleneck . in fig .",

    "we did not display them in fig .",
    "[ j_bound_ld ] since the deviations due to correlations are larger than the positive / mixed edge effect itself . in the appendix",
    "it is shown that the negative edge effect is predominant in regimes where the current depends significantly on the boundary rates .",
    "moreover , we see that the current does not attain a plateau value .",
    "instead it seems to approach asymptotically the value @xmath135 ( fig .  [ j(a)_bn_boundary ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed by our simulations , where we calculated the current for the very high value @xmath136 that yielded an effective entry rate of @xmath137 .",
    "since we assume the effective entry rate to grow monotonic with the real entry rate , we can conclude that we have always @xmath138 , thus the maximum current phase can never be attained .",
    "as we have argued above , there is no phase separation , either , if the distance of the bottleneck from the boundary is microscopic , so we can state that for a bottleneck near the boundary only the high and low density phase can occur .",
    "this is plausible since a similar argument for the absence of the maximum current phase in subsystem  3 as in sec .",
    "[ one_bottleneck ] applies .",
    "though strictly speaking there is no m / ps - phase if the bottleneck is near a boundary , the system still exhibits a kind of _",
    "crossover_. while there is neither a plateau region nor a sharp kink in the dependence of the current on the entry rate ( see fig .",
    "[ j(a)_bn_boundary ] ) , for higher entry rates this dependence is rather weak . for a bottleneck",
    "far from the boundaries we actually have sharp phase transitions , so we can say that by approaching the bottleneck to the boundary , the phase transition to the m / ps - phase is `` softened '' into a crossover .",
    "the transition from low density phase to the high density phase occurs for @xmath139 .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ mass(a)_bn_boundary ] where we have plotted the average density in dependence on @xmath14 . the jump in the average density marks the transition point , which matches quite good the value of @xmath140 .",

    "the value calculated by solving the isa equations ( [ current_cons(near_bound)_1 ] ) and ( [ current_cons(near_bound)_2 ] ) is a little less , but it still yields the correct sign of the shift of the transition point .",
    "[ aeff(a ) ] shows the dependence of @xmath140 on @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath139 is the transition line between high and low density phase , the diagram simultaneously displays the phase diagram , interpreting the y - axis as the @xmath15-range . as we see",

    "this observation indicates that _ bottlenecks far from the boundary do not have any influence on the current _ , as long as the current is below the maximum current allowed by that bottleneck .    in fig .",
    "[ jmax(l)&defect ] , however , we see the maximum current in a system with a bottleneck of length @xmath1 far from the boundaries and a defect at site 3 .",
    "again , one does not see a significant difference : _ a small bottleneck near the boundary has no influence on the transport capacity_.    in agreement with observations already made in @xcite , our results motivate the view of a local influence of bottlenecks that yields the possibility to generalize concepts of the tasep with single bottleneck to systems with many bottlenecks .",
    "only bottlenecks near the boundaries have influence on the current if it is below the transport capacity .",
    "we therefore propose that the influence of boundary defects can be taken into account through effective boundary rates in the same manner as for a single bottleneck near the boundaries .",
    "that means that below the maximum current we can describe the system as a pure tasep , but with effective boundary rates @xmath160 depending on the configuration of bottlenecks near the boundaries instead of the pure ones .",
    "we have investigated the tasep in the presence of a bottleneck of @xmath1 consecutive slow sites .",
    "apart from computer simulations we have developed an approximate analytical approach called _ interacting subsystem approximation ( isa ) _ that makes use of the exact results obtained for the pure tasep .",
    "isa turns out to be an efficient and accurate method for systems with a single bottleneck .",
    "it can be applied to other systems as long as exact results are available .",
    "therefore we have divided the system into subsystems consisting of fast and slow sites only , where the exact solution @xcite for the homogeneous system applies . in the treatment of the coupling of these systems",
    "certain correlations are neglected .",
    "nevertheless the predictions of the analytical approach are in good agreement with the simulations , while they slightly underestimate the real current .",
    "our method yields much better results than e.g.  the mean field approach in @xcite for single defects . for longer bottlenecks",
    "it is much more computationally efficient than the approach by chou and lakatos @xcite , which produces results of a similar accuracy .",
    "the _ finite segment mean field theory ( fsmft ) _ introduced in @xcite takes into account only particle correlations within the bottleneck section and a certain number of sites adjacent to it .",
    "this approach is more flexible in the kind of systems that can be treated , but it is algorithmically more complex and less efficient since it requires the determination of the leading eigenvector of a matrix that grows exponentially in the segment length @xmath1 . as a consequence",
    "it can not be applied to systems with longer bottlenecks @xmath161 ) .",
    "in contrast , the isa method relies on finding _ one _ root of a polynomial whose degree is approximately @xmath1 .",
    "this root can be isolated by physical constraints . for this problem fast algorithms",
    "exist making it possible to compute the current for very large bottlenecks .",
    "moreover the accuracy of the isa even increases for longer bottlenecks .",
    "since later @xcite we want to use our results for disordered systems with finite density of defects , a method that can also be applied to long bottlenecks is required and the isa appears to be a suitable procedure for this task .    the isa can be applied for calculating the transport capacity ( maximum current ) and the transition point to the phase separated phase of a system with a bottleneck far from the boundaries , as well as the current of a system with a bottleneck near the boundaries . if the bottleneck is far from the boundaries , the main effect on the current is a lowering of the maximum current .",
    "it is independent of the bottleneck position , but things change if the bottleneck is located near one of the boundaries . here",
    "interactions with the particle input or output become important ( _ edge effect _ , for single defect sites see @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a change of the current .",
    "isa reproduces the increase of the transport capacity if defects are moved towards the boundary which was found by dong et al .",
    "additional to this _ positive _ edge effect , isa predicts that for lower entry rates the current is _ decreased _ by a bottleneck near a boundary compared to the situation where it is deep in the bulk .",
    "this _ negative _ edge effect is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations also show that there is a regime where even a non - monotonic dependence on the bottleneck position is possible .",
    "this effect , however , is _ not _ reproduced by isa which indicates that it has its origin in correlations that are neglected in the approximation .",
    "a bottleneck near the boundary also has crucial effects on the phase diagram .",
    "indeed it leads to an _ absence _ of a maximum current-/phase separated phase !",
    "one can say , the bottleneck near the boundary softens the phase transition into a _",
    "crossover_. the remaining phase transition line between low and high density phase , on the other hand , is distorted compared to the pure system .",
    "this observation motivates the concept of _ effective boundary rates _ :",
    "the effects of the boundary bottleneck are encompassed as effective boundary rates and the system can be described as a pure one with the effective rates instead of the real ones .",
    "one can calculate the relation between effective and real rates by isa which then can be used to determine the phase transition line .    in future work @xcite we will use the present results to derive an effective theory for disordered systems which have a finite density of defect sites even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the results obtained here for systems with two bottlenecks indicate that an accurate description of the disordered case can be obtained , since the `` interaction '' of bottlenecks is rather local which is in agreement with observations in @xcite and @xcite . for large distances of bottlenecks ,",
    "the maximum current in the tasep is dominated by the longest bottleneck while ( smaller ) bottlenecks even close to the boundaries do not have any influence on it .",
    "this observation supports the conjecture made in @xcite for periodic systems with quenched disorder that the longest bottleneck is dominating the transport capacity , and hence the transition to phase separation",
    ". therefore it will be important to have an analytical approach that can deal efficiently with very long bottlenecks .",
    "in contrast , if the system is not in the maximum current phase , we have found that even large bottlenecks in the bulk do not have an influence on the current .",
    "these observations indicate that we can treat boundary effects and transport capacity independently for systems with many bottlenecks by using the concept of effective boundary rates and the isa also in this case .",
    "natural applications of the results presented here are to biological transport .",
    "the tasep is the basis for the description of protein synthesis and also active intracellular transport of motor proteins along microtubuli . in both cases disorder",
    "plays an importat role through the inhomogeneity of the mrna template @xcite or microtubuli associated proteins ( maps ) that attach to microtubuli and can form obstacles for the motion of mobile motor proteins like kinesin @xcite .",
    "we now want to determine a condition that the current decreases for a bottleneck approaching a boundary ( _ negative edge effect _ ) .",
    "again , due to the particle - hole symmetry ( [ p - h - symmetry ] ) it is sufficient to consider a bottleneck near the left boundary .",
    "we have to distinguish if the current for a defect at a small distance @xmath162 from the boundary is larger or less than the current for a defect far from the boundary , @xmath163 . though the dependence of the current on the position of the first defect is not always monotonic , for an approximation it is sufficient to compare the current @xmath164 for _ one _ position of the defect near the boundary with the current @xmath165 for a defect far from the boundary , since the mixed edge effect ( see sec",
    ".  [ one_bottleneck_at_boundary ] ) is quite weak and only in a small parameter region . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath166 .",
    "using ( [ z(n ) ] ) and ( [ zp(n ) ] ) yields @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the virtual exit rate of subsystem 1 .",
    "the edge effect is negative if @xmath169 in the l - phase we have @xmath170 and ( [ edge - ineq2 ] ) is fullfilled if @xmath171    though we can not determine @xmath168 exactly , we can state that @xmath168 is less than in a pure system with @xmath172 .",
    "however , in a pure system there is a flat density profile without correlations , and we have exactly @xmath173 , so ( [ neg_edge - eff - cond ] ) is always fulfilled .",
    "therefore in the l - phase and , due to particle - hole - symmetry , in the h - phase , the edge effect is always negative .    in systems with many randomly distributed bottlenecks",
    "it is very unlikely that longest one is near the boundary .",
    "thus the transition to the ps - phase , where the current is independent of the boundary rates , will occur for lower rates of @xmath174 , where the negative edge effect is predominant ."
