    "the universe today is composed of three main components . by mass - density ,",
    "ordinary or visible matter ( vm ) accounts for about 4% , dark matter ( dm ) for 21% and dark energy for the remainder .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to suggest an explanation for why the densities of visible and dark matter are so similar , with the latter about a factor of five more dense than the former .",
    "if dark matter is supposed to be an independent sector from ordinary matter , then their rather similar mass densities is a puzzle .",
    "the generic expectation is that the mass densities should differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "but we may turn this around and explore the hypothesis that the similar densities imply a deep connection between vm and dm , especially the way both are produced in the early universe . in this talk",
    ", i report on a scheme developed with bell , petraki and shoemaker for producing visible and dark matter from a common source , and with tightly related number densities.@xcite    the starting point is the fact that the ordinary matter density today is due to a baryon - antibaryon asymmetry .",
    "if the plasma of the early universe had been exactly symmetric between particles and antiparticles , then the very efficient annihilation processes would have left a universe today with hardly any matter in it .",
    "it is thus necessary to suppose that the primordial plasma had a small asymmetry in favour of particles over antiparticles , with the matter in the universe today comprised of the excess baryons and electrons .",
    "if we wish to explain why the dm density today is similar to vm , then it makes sense to explore the idea that the present dm population is also the relic from a slightly asymmetric primordial dark plasma .",
    "this general idea has been discussed for a long time , but has recently attracted increased attention as well as having acquired the catchy title of ` asymmetric dm ' ( adm).@xcite it should be contrasted with the much - studied hypothesis that dm is a majorana fermion , such as the neutralino or the sterile neutrino .",
    "the relic abundance of a majorana particle obviously can not be due to a particle - antiparticle asymmetry ( unless the mass is tiny so that the two helicity states become effectively particle and antiparticle ) .    making dm",
    "asymmetric renders it qualitatively similar to ordinary matter , but we want to go further and make a quantitative connection . because a mass density depends on both a number density and a particle mass , we will ultimately need a way to relate these two properties between the two sectors . in this talk ,",
    "i discuss how one may relate number densities , leaving the particle mass question open .",
    "the key idea is that the universe may be secretly baryon symmetric !",
    "it could be that there is a well - defined sense in which dm carries antibaryon number which exactly cancels the baryon number carried by the vm.@xcite if true , then the baryon asymmetry is an illusion .",
    "nevertheless , there is a genuine asymmetry in another quantum number , as we now discuss .",
    "( actually , there is a certain poetic licence inherent in the `` baryon - symmetric universe '' title .",
    "the precise definition appears below . )",
    "the stability of ordinary matter is due in significant measure to the conservation of baryon number . for our purposes , it is convenient to rename this quantity as ` visible baryon number ' and designate it as @xmath0 .",
    "it is this quantity we refer to when talking of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . in adm models",
    ", there is an analogous ` dark baryon number ' @xmath1 that plays an important role in ensuring the stability of dm , and its relic density is due to a @xmath1 asymmetry .",
    "now form the orthogonal linear combinations @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a generalised baryon number carried by both vm and dm . for simplicity , this will simply be called ` baryon number ' .",
    "the baryon - symmetric universe refers to this quantity , postulating that @xmath4 for the universe as a whole , with @xmath5 the orthogonal charge @xmath6 is necessarily asymmetric : @xmath7 the point of this is that dm number density is determined by @xmath8 and the baryon number carried by the dm particle or particles .",
    "since @xmath8 equals the visible baryon asymmetry , we achieve a strong connection between the number densities of vm and dm , which is our goal .",
    "we now know what we want , but how do we realise it ? the simple equations above tell us the answer : we need to generate an @xmath6 asymmetry while maintaining @xmath9 . rather than generating visible baryon number _ per se _ ,",
    "we want to generate @xmath6 number .",
    "the sakharov conditions then become our guide.@xcite we want early universe dynamics that features @xmath6- , @xmath10- and @xmath11-violating interactions that occur out of equilibrium .",
    "since we do not wish a @xmath3 asymmetry , then @xmath3 must either be always conserved , or violated without the other conditions holding .",
    "elegance and robustness argues for the @xmath3 conservation option : the universe is baryon symmetric , because @xmath3 is not violated by the dynamics that creates the particle asymmetries .",
    "the @xmath6-creation process must switch off in the late universe , so that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independently conserved today .",
    "one may now take any standard mechanism for baryon asymmetry generation , and recast it for @xmath6 generation . in this talk ,",
    "i describe how one may use the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism@xcite in a scenario termed `` pangenesis '' , meaning the unified creation of all matter@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "[ ] ) .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the ad mechanism is the coherent production of charge ( equivalent to an asymmetry ) from the oscillations of a scalar condensate when the associated symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "recall that the noether current for a charged scalar field is @xmath12 .",
    "the charge density is @xmath13 , which can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the creation of a charge - carrying scalar condensate requires it to be oscillating in time .",
    "the initiation of these oscillations requires the sakharov conditions to be met .",
    "because @xmath6-violation today must be extremely weak , we need a way of amplifying these effects in the early universe .",
    "the ad pangenesis structure is this : at the renormalisable level , both @xmath3 and @xmath6 are conserved .",
    "effective non - renormalisable operators that preserve @xmath3 but violate @xmath6 are then introduced .",
    "these effective operators are suppressed by some powers of an ultraviolet cutoff scale @xmath16 , with the exponents depending on the specific operators used .",
    "the key observation is that the suppression will be lifted if scalar fields appearing in those operators develop large values in the early universe .    for a scalar field to be able to acquire a large value , it must define a flat direction in the scalar potential .",
    "flat directions are a generic feature of scalar potentials in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , so scenarios invoking the ad mechanism fit in very well with the susy solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the exactly flat directions found in generic renormalisable theories with unbroken supersymmetry are lifted by both soft susy - breaking scalar masses and non - renormalisable effective operators .",
    "nevertheless , the directions remain flat enough for the ad mechanism to work : the soft electroweak - scale masses are negligible in the high - energy regime where ad condensate formation occurs , and the non - renormalisable terms only come into play for exceptionally large field values .    of the many possible models for pangenesis",
    ", i shall describe only one.@xcite this model has three sectors : visible , dark and connector .",
    "the visible sector is an extension of the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the dark sector is described by a separate gauge theory and will not be specified in this talk ; there are many possibilities .",
    "the connector sector is where the ad dynamics takes place .",
    "it contains flat - direction scalar fields that form an @xmath6-laden condensate . through",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath6 conserving interactions , the @xmath6 charge of the condensate is transferred into a @xmath0-asymmetric visible particle plasma and a @xmath1-asymmetric dark - sector soup .",
    "consider table [ ta1 ] .",
    "it lists the chiral superfields @xmath17 , and there are also vector - like partners @xmath18 .",
    "the u(1 ) charges are arranged so that @xmath19 and @xmath20 carry @xmath6-charge but zero @xmath3-charge .",
    "these two superfields define the connector sector .",
    "the supermultiplets @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( and their vector - like partners ) belong to the visible and dark sectors , respectively .",
    "their role is to transfer the @xmath6 asymmetry carried by the connector fields to the other two sectors .",
    "the renormalisable superpotential for the superfields in table [ ta1 ] is @xmath23 we see therefore that there are no quartic terms for the @xmath24 scalar potential , so these fields define a `` flat plane '' , a two - dimensional generalisation of a flat direction .",
    "there are of course potentially many other flat directions , especially when one includes the mssm and dark sector fields .",
    "one then needs a reason for why large field values are generated in the @xmath24 plane , but not in other directions .",
    "an elegant solution to this problem lies in having the role of @xmath0 played by ordinary baryon - minus - lepton number  call it @xmath25  rather than just ordinary baryon number . because @xmath25 is anomaly - free",
    ", we can gauge it .",
    "let us suppose that actually the generalised `` baryon '' number @xmath26 is gauged , but @xmath6 is not .",
    "now , to get a flat direction , we need both @xmath27-flatness and @xmath28-flatness . with gauged @xmath3 , @xmath27-flatness requires that flat directions carry a vanishing expectation value for the @xmath3 charge .",
    "this lifts all potential flat directions that could spoil pangenesis , because we are now assured that any flat direction is incapable of generating an asymmetry in @xmath3 .    to have the baryon - symmetric ad mechanism operate , we now add non - renormalisable terms to the superpotential which respect @xmath3 but explicitly violate @xmath6 .",
    "examples include @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there are others that preserve both @xmath3 and @xmath6 , but they do not play any important role in the ad dynamics .",
    "these quartic superpotential terms are multiplied by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath16 is the uv cut - off as before .",
    "the coupling constants contain the required @xmath11-violating phases , as well as helping to quantify the strength of explicit @xmath6 violation .",
    "the important terms in the scalar potential for the flat plane are@xcite @xmath35 |\\phi_0|^2   + \\left[\\hat{m}_0 ^ 2(t )   -   \\hat{c } h^2\\right ] |\\hat{\\phi}_0|^2   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\frac{(a_k \\tilde{m } + a_k h ) \\lambda_k}{m } \\phi_0^k \\hat{\\phi}_0^{4-k } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{k=0}^3 \\sum_{l=0}^{3-k } \\frac{\\lambda^2_{kl}}{m^2 }   \\left(\\phi_0^ * \\hat{\\phi}_0\\right)^{3-k - l}|\\phi_0|^{2k}|\\hat{\\phi}_0|^{2l } + h.c .",
    ",   \\label{eq : vfd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 include thermal masses , @xmath37 is the hubble parameter , and soft susy breaking is parameterised by @xmath38 .",
    "the hubble parameter enters the potential because the finite vacuum energy density during inflation breaks susy .",
    "this potential has all the ingredients for ad generation of @xmath6 , since the terms in the second and third lines violate both @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "the vacuum - energy induced @xmath39 corrections to the scalar masses are also very important , because they allow the initial scalar field values after inflation to be very large .",
    "the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 are required to be positive , so that when @xmath42 gives the dominant contribution to the squared masses the potential minima are displaced to very large field values . during inflation ,",
    "the scalar fields fall into these minima .",
    "the subsequent evolution has two aspects to it because we have a two - field ad setup , rather than the standard one - field situation .",
    "the evolution can be decomposed into the angular and radial directions .",
    "being @xmath6 and @xmath11 violating , the sextic terms in the third line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfd ] ) are able to drive @xmath6 creation through evolution along the angular direction , before the standard ad radial oscillations are able to begin .",
    "this is useful , because the thermal masses are known to have a suppressing effect on asymmetry generation for the case where the explicit charge violation occurs at quartic order in the superpotential .",
    "the radial evolution begins after @xmath42 decreases sufficiently to make the squared masses positive .",
    "the angularly - evolving fields now no longer have to maintain a large radius because that is no longer energetically favoured .",
    "explicit calculations@xcite have shown that the asymmetry generated is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number density asymmetry relative to entropy density , @xmath45 is a measure of the @xmath11-violating phases , @xmath46 is the reheating temperature after inflation and @xmath47 is the planck mass . the correct asymmetry can be obtained for reasonable choices of all parameters .    the @xmath6 asymmetry held by the condensate",
    "must now be transferred into both visible and dark sector particles .",
    "this occurs through the @xmath48 and @xmath49 renormalisable terms .",
    "since these terms respect both @xmath3 and @xmath6 , their role is purely one of transfer ; they can not change the value of the asymmetry . recall that @xmath21 and its partner are visible sector fields , and @xmath22 and its partner reside in the dark sector . the scalar fields @xmath50 and @xmath51 defining the condensate can decay directly into the fermionic components of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we see that for every visible sector field created , there is a corresponding dark sector field , so the key baryon - symmetric feature is preserved .",
    "the supermultiplet @xmath21 may couple in many ways to mssm fields and thus inject the asymmetry throughout the visible sector : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . similarly @xmath22 and/or @xmath58 may couple to further dark - sector degrees of freedom .",
    "the asymmetry in the visible sector will in general be reprocessed by sphaleron effects in the usual way .",
    "for example , if the @xmath54 term is the means by which the transfer occurs , then the @xmath6-charge initially manifests as lepton number , and the sphaleron reprocessing is essential .    for the dark asymmetry to be the sole determinant of the dm number density , we need the symmetric part of the dark plasma to efficiently annihilate into radiation that subsequently redshifts and becomes insignificant .",
    "this means a dark sector force of some description must exist .",
    "a simple possibility is that it is a dark analogue of electromagnetism : an unbroken u(1 ) gauge force .",
    "this has the added benefit that the dark photon could kinetically mix with the ordinary photon and enhance the direct detection prospects of the asymmetric dm .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge symmetry can also be spontaneously broken .",
    "the cosmological observations of the visible and dark matter densities imply a prediction for the dark matter mass .",
    "it is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the proton mass , and @xmath61 is the baryon number of the dm particle . for reasonable values of the latter parameter , we see that the several - gev regime is predicted .",
    "this is common to all adm models , with the baryon - symmetric variety providing an explicit value for @xmath62 .",
    "note that this is typically not equal to one , because of sphaleron reprocessing .",
    "the analogue of sphaleron effects may well exist in the dark sector as well , so that needs to be specified before the ratio of the final asymmetries can actually be computed .",
    "conversely , a terrestrial measurement of the dm mass would tell us what @xmath63 has to be and thus help us construct the internal physics of the dark sector .",
    "it is interesting that present results from dama@xcite , cogent@xcite and cresst@xcite favour a dm mass in this range , though of course the true situation is far from settled .",
    "finally , we note that the above discussion needs to be generalised if the dm is multicomponent , which is a perfectly reasonable possibility .",
    "this scenario has potential implications for both dm direct detection experiments and collider physics .",
    "if @xmath3 is gauged , then the associated @xmath64 mediates spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering , with a per nucleon cross - section given by @xmath65 for the case where a massive dark photon @xmath27 kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon , the cross - section is @xmath66 this is potentially large enough to be relevant for the dama and cogent signals , but there is enough parameter freedom to lower it should that become necessary ( to obey the xenon constraints@xcite , for example ) .",
    "the @xmath64 could be directly produced at the lhc if it is light enough .",
    "if so , it would have a substantial invisible width into dark sector species , making it distinguishable from standard @xmath64 candidates.@xcite    finally , we comment that the lightest supersymmetric particle in the visible sector should contribute in a negligible way to the dm density in pangenesis .",
    "if the visible lsp is a stable neutralino , for example , it should be primarily an admixture of the wino and the higgsinos to allow it to annihilate efficiently and be underabundant .",
    "pangenesis  the simultaneous creation of visible and dark matter in a baryon - symmetric universe via the affleck - dine mechanism  is a viable cosmological scenario that is consistent with the supersymmetric resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "evidence for pangenesis would be : a dm mass in the several gev range , supersymmetry , a @xmath64 with significant coupling to the dark sector , and a dm direct detection process mediated by kinetic mixing between the ordinary photon and a dark - sector analogue .",
