    ", cnts have received intense attention@xcite due to their unique tunable electronic properties , which lead to remarkable mechanical , thermal and optical features .",
    "a variety of potential applications of cnts have been studied by many experimental and theoretical groups in recent years , including the cnt - based nanosensing applications such as gas sensors@xcite which can detect gases such as o@xmath0@xcite , h@xmath0@xcite or no@xmath0@xcite ; and photovoltaic solar cells@xcite in which the cnts serve as electron acceptors and the conjugated polymers , for example p3ot , as electron donors .",
    "more recent experiments also used the si - cnt junctions to achieve the solar cell with high efficiency@xcite .",
    "the interaction of cnts with atoms or molecules is the key ingredient for utilizing cnts as materials with desired functions and properties .",
    "there are two basic types of particle adsorption , chemisorption and physisorption . in chemisorption , the adsorbate , an atom or a molecule , is covalently bonded to the cnt .",
    "it either transfers electrons to or extracts them from the nanotube resulting in an enhanced conductance@xcite . in physisorption ,",
    "the van der waals interaction becomes the dominant interaction between the adsorbate and the cnt , and the electronic structure of the cnts only changes slightly ; however , the dopants can introduce some localized states that are placed inside the band gap of semiconducting cnts@xcite .",
    "depending on the position of the impurity state inside the band gap , @xmath2-type or @xmath10-type semiconducting cnt systems can be made . for problems related to photophysics and chemistry ,",
    "these localized , mid - gap states open additional relaxation pathways to facilitate the electron transfer upon photo - excitations@xcite .",
    "the rates for these processes , which measure how fast the electron in the cnt is transferred to the chemical species , are important quantities in the dynamics of such relaxation aided by lattice vibration .",
    "therefore , an understanding of rates and hence the relaxation processes is of fundamental importance in device applications like photovoltaic solar cells and organic light - emitting diodes .",

    "while cas - ci or tddft based dynamics approach can be applied to study excited states and photo - induced dynamics with high accuracy , their high computational costs limit their application to comparatively small - scale systems . the reduced density matrix formalism , which includes weak electron - phonon couplings , is an appropriate theoretical tool to study phonon - assisted processes , as it requires the least computation effort among the approaches mentioned above . previously , micha _ et al .",

    "we have set up two types of theoretical models .",
    "the first one consists of a semiconducting ( @xmath2,0 ) cnt and a dinitropentylpyrene , in which the dinitromethane ch@xmath0n@xmath0o@xmath1 is linked , via an aliphatic chain , to the pyrene c@xmath11h@xmath12 ( fig.[cnt_sys]a ) that has been adsorbed on the cnt .",
    "the second one consists of the same ( @xmath2,0 ) cnt but only a dinitromethane ( fig .",
    "[ cnt_sys]b ) directly adsorbed on the cnt .",
    "since the sizes of the adsorbate in both cases are different , the corresponding cnt supercells for adsorbates in the first and the second cases have been constructed to contain five and two cnt primitive cells , or 200 and 80 carbon atoms , respectively .",

    "the first model has been used to understand the enhanced binding between the functioning molecule and the cnt via large contact area between the pyrene fragment and the cnt , as was realized in experiments@xcite , and the second model has served as a simplified model system for investigating electron dynamics upon excitation .",
    "the rest of this section details ( a ) the density functional theory ( dft ) and approximations that have been used for the structural optimizations , energetics and the electronic structures ; and ( b ) the reduced density matrix formalism combined with the dft that has been employed to study the dynamics of the phonon - assisted intra - band relaxations in both the conduction band and the valence band .        the foundations of dft state that for an @xmath13-electron system , all the ground - state physical properties can be determined once the ground - state charge density of the system is known .",

    "we have also repeated our calculations in the pristine ( 7,0 ) , ( 13,0 ) , ( 16,0 ) and ( 19,0 ) cnts , with results also shown in table ii .",
    "there are a few things worth pointing out : first , the relaxation times for the electrons are smaller than those of the holes in all the cnts ; an electron in the conduction band relaxes more rapidly than the hole in the valence band , which agrees with habenicht _",
    "s results@xcite of intra - band relaxations for ( 7,0 ) cnt . in their paper",
    ", they claim that the hole in the valence band interacts more strongly with the radial - breathing phonon mode ( rbpm ) than with the g - type longitudinal optical phonon mode ( lopm ) in the cnt , while the electron in the conduction band mainly interacts with the latter mode .",
    "the transition rate between two states depends on the non - adiabatic coupling as well as the number of phonons at the state energy difference . in our studies ,",
    "the corresponding phonon energy for the lopm is about @xmath145 while it is less than @xmath146 for the rbpm , in all the pristine cnt systems .",
    "we have found that the energy differences for adjacent , non - degenerate states @xmath147 are closer to the lopm phonon energy , which suggests that the lopm plays an important role in the phonon - assisted relaxations . in the ( 10,0 ) , ( 13,0 ) and ( 16,0 ) cnts , we have also found that the non - adiabatic couplings for adjacent conduction band states are about an order of magnitude larger than those for valence band states . in ( 7,0 ) and ( 19,0 ) cnt , the couplings for conduction band states are about two times larger than those for valence band states . therefore , the electron couples with the phonon stronger than the hole does , which results in a faster electron relaxation dynamics .",
    "second , the hole relaxation time constant in the pristine ( 7,0 ) cnt is @xmath148 , while the electron relaxation time constant is only @xmath149 .",
    "these are comparable with the time scales computed in reference [ ] . third , the calculated hole relaxation time constants vary between @xmath150 to @xmath151 . the relaxation time constants of the electron , on the other hand , change from @xmath152 to about @xmath149 .",

    "the results are given in table iii .",
    "upon adsorption , our studies of electronic structures show that there is a gap state provided by the adsorbate in each case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dos_cnts ] , and the electron relaxation time constants are much smaller than the hole relaxation time constants . again , this is due to larger non - adiabatic couplings in the conduction band than in the valence band .",
    "the relaxation time constants as functions of the chiral index @xmath2 , which in this situation is proportional to the tube radius , are visualized in fig .",
    "[ rates.n ] .",
    "it is clear that the relaxation time constants depend on the tube radius .",
    "compared with the results of the intra - band relaxations in pristine ( @xmath2,0 ) cnts , we have found that the electron and hole relaxation time constants are modified , but there is not a clear trend for the change .",
    "the electron relaxation in all the cases upon adsorption occurs very rapidly .",
    "typically this process completes at less than @xmath159 .",
    "when @xmath5 , the presence of the gap state facilitates the electron relaxation by a factor of two .",
    "when @xmath155 , however , the electron relaxation time does increase by a factor of two .",
    "when @xmath156 and 19 , the electron relaxation times are comparable with those in the corresponding pristine cnt cases .",
    "the hole relaxations , on the other hand , are all on sub - picosecond time scales . except for @xmath5 where the hole relaxation time is comparable with the pristine cnt value , all the hole relaxation times differ by a factor of two when they are compared with the values in pristine cnt cases .",
    "in particular , the hole relaxation time constant in both @xmath155 and 19 upon adsorption is doubled , while it is reduced by half when @xmath156 .    since the lumo is the gap state in all the four cases and",
    "the initially photo - excited electron is in the cnt , when the intra - band relaxation in the conduction band is complete , there is an electron transfer from the cnt to the adsorbate . as an example , fig .",
    "[ dynamics]c shows such process of the photo - induced charge transfer in the ( 10,0 ) cnt - adsorbate system .",
    "it is clear that the photo - excited electron originally in the cnt eventually hops to the adsorbate , leaving a hole inside the cnt . in each case",
    ", the electron transfer occurs at the same time scales as the intra - band relaxation in the conduction band , i.e. @xmath137s .",
    "this process takes about @xmath160 or less in all the cases .    , and ( * b * ) : the hole relaxation time constant @xmath161 , versus the chiral index @xmath2 , for the pristine ( @xmath2,0 ) cnts and for ( @xmath2,0 ) cnt functionalized by dinitromethane.,width=377 ]    note that in dft calculations there is an issue about the band gap error , which is important in the studies of inter - band relaxation where the photo - excited electron in the conduction band recombines with the hole in the valence band . in the semiconducting cnts ,",
    "such relaxation is on time scales of @xmath162 or even @xmath163@xcite , which is at least an order of magnitude larger than the intra - band relaxation aided by phonons . in the present work ,",
    "since we mainly study the dynamics of the latter , we do not expect that this issue significantly changes our results .",
    "however , more accurate calculations such as the hybrid functional calculations@xcite or the gw method@xcite to correct the band gap will be applied in the future .",
    "in addition , we assume that upon photo - excitations , the geometrical distortion is small so that the huang - rhys factors@xcite , which measure the contributions of phonon modes to the reorganization energy , are negligible .",
    "we also assume that the electron - phonon interaction is weak such that the intra - band relaxation dynamics can be studied in the redfield theory within the markov approximation .",
    "such approximations are justified by the fact that the calculated time constants for pristine cnts are in good agreement with experiments .",
    "however , more rigorous approach such as the nonequilibrium green s function based technique , where those interactions are described by the non - markovian relaxation terms in kadanoff - baym equations@xcite , can be applied in the future .",
    "finally , in our calculations we have neglected excitonic effects concerning the interaction between the photo - excited electron and the hole . with all these approximations mentioned above , it is surprisingly good that our results agree well with the experiments for the pristine semiconducting ( @xmath2,0 ) cnts@xcite .",
    "however , more advanced studies including these effects will be addressed in the future .",
    "we have studied semiconducting ( @xmath2,0 ) cnts for @xmath5 , 13 , 16 and 19 that are functionalized by a physisorbed electron - accepting functional group , dinitromethane or ch@xmath164n@xmath164o@xmath165 .",
    "we find that the functional group can be firmly attached to the tube using a pyrene anchoring fragment .",
    "the functional group contributes additional states in the band gap of the cnt , but the pyrene fragment acts only as an anchor that enhances the binding between the dinitromethane and the cnt . in order to reduce computational intensity",
    ", the set of smaller systems , cnts with the functional group only , has been used for further investigations .",
    "we find that an excited state of the functionalized cnt undergoes electronic dynamics coupled to thermal lattice vibrations , and electronic energy dissipates into lattice vibrations .",
    "furthermore , our studies of the dynamics of intra - band relaxations indicate that upon initial photo - excitation , an electron from the cnt ends up being transferred to the adsorbate , while a hole stays in the cnt .",
    "electronic - state dynamics demonstrates two effects : ( i ) electrons and holes lose their energy into thermal vibrations and ( ii ) electrons and holes migrate in space .",
    "such migration often leads to the formation of a charge separation state .",
    "we have quantified electronic relaxation with rate constants .",
    "the photo - induced charge transfer completes in about @xmath160 in all cases . for pristine cnts , the calculated intra - band relaxation time constants agree well with the experimental time scales .",
    "our calculations predict that electron relaxation in the conduction band is faster than hole relaxation in the valence band in such cnt systems , with and without the adsorbed dinitromethane molecules .",
    "this is due to the stronger electron - phonon interaction in the conduction band than the hole - phonon interaction in the valence band .",
    "our results have twofold importance : ( i ) we demonstrate the applicability of the density matrix formulation in the kohn - sham dft framework to a broader range of systems ; and ( ii ) our results provide an important step toward developing solar energy harvesting materials .",
