    "although the existence of x - ray emission in the jets of active galactic nuclei was known prior to the launch of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , it was surprising to discover that a substantial fraction of observed kiloparsec - scale jets have detectable x - ray counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in some cases",
    " notably the fanaroff - riley i radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) off @xmath10 gev electrons in the jet ( ic / cmb ) provides an alternative x - ray emission mechanism @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton process may be important in some condensed regions with high densities of relativistic electrons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ic / cmb emission should be most pronounced in high - redshift objects with jets whose flow velocities remain highly relativistic out to scales of tens or hundreds of kiloparsecs , as long as one of the two opposing jets points almost directly along the line of sight . in this context @xmath0-ray blazars ,",
    "whose jets display faster apparent speeds than the general population of compact flat spectrum radio sources @xcite , are prime candidates for strong ic / cmb emission .",
    "detection of ic / cmb x - rays provides a determination of the doppler factor on kiloparsec scales ( see appendix a and * ? ? ?",

    "a number of kiloparsec scale jets show a decrease in the ratio of x - ray to radio intensity with distance from the core @xcite .",
    "this could result from gradual decrease of the bulk lorentz factor on kiloparsec scales @xcite .",
    "such a model can be tested only in the case of observation of multi - knot jet structure at two or more frequencies , which are rarely available despite the high sensitivity of chandra observations . for these reasons , the detected x - ray / radio jet of the @xmath0-ray bright quasar 0827 + 243 ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the most striking features of the combined x - ray and radio images ( fig .",

    "outside the nuclear region , the radio emission first rises above the noise level only near the bend .",
    "the direction of the inner x - ray jet is within @xmath60 of that of the parsec - scale radio jet , where @xcite have measured apparent speeds as high as @xmath61 .",
    "this apparent speed implies that the bulk lorentz factor @xmath62 , with an optimal viewing angle @xmath63 . using the least extreme values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 provides an estimate of the doppler factor on parsec scales , @xmath66^{-1 } \\sim \\gamma \\approx 22 $ ] , where @xmath67 is the actual bulk velocity in units of @xmath51 .",

    "because of limited photon statistics , the angular sizes determined from the x - ray image are uncertain by @xmath73% .",
    "similarly , the offsets of the x - ray and radio intensity apparent in figs",
    ". 4 and 5 in features @xmath23 and @xmath24 may not be real .",
    "the presence of any x - ray photons outside the core region _ is _ highly significant , but the absence of such photons near the periphery of a knot could be due to either a genuine lack of emission or insufficient exposure time .    in order to produce an apparent bend of @xmath74 , the jet would need to change its intrinsic direction by an angle at least equal to the initial viewing angle .",
    "since this is only @xmath75 , the intrinsic change in trajectory can be quite modest .",
    "the bend could be caused by deflection of the jet flow by a cloud , in which case one would expect a standing shock wave to compress and heat the jet plasma while it decelerates the bulk motion .",
    "the observed drop in intensity around the bend ( see fig .",
    "6 ) implies that the decrease in doppler beaming more strongly influences the observed emission than does the compression and heating .",
    "an alternative scenario for the apparent bending is that the jet flow has always been straight , but the direction of the `` nozzle '' changed .",
    "that is , about @xmath76  yr in the past the jet might have pointed from the nucleus to knot @xmath44 , then steadily swung until it reached its current direction about @xmath77 yr ago . in this case , knots @xmath24 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 could no longer be energized by the jet .",
    "the radiative lifetime of electrons emitting at a frequency @xmath78 ghz is @xmath79^{-1}~~{\\rm yr},\\ ] ] where the quantities on the right - hand side are all defined in appendix a. this includes energy losses to both synchrotron radiation and ic / cmb scattering in the thomson limit . for the magnetic fields we derive in the next section , the lifetimes of electrons ( times the bulk lorentz factor @xmath64 to translate to the rest frame of the host galaxy ) radiating at 15 ghz are considerably shorter than the estimated age of knot _",
    "c6 _ , @xmath80 yr .",
    "the most popular models to explain the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of features on kiloparsec scales involve ( 1 ) synchrotron radiation from a single population @xcite or dual population @xcite of relativistic electrons , and/or ( 2 ) inverse - compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of several x - ray knots at different distances from the core allows us to constrain the possible emission processes , and then to derive key physical parameters and how they vary as a function of distance from the nucleus .",
    "measurements of the radio synchrotron emission determine the value of the product @xmath81 , or an upper limit for knots that are not detected at either 5 or 15 ghz , through eq .",
    "this product depends on the unknown quantities @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , which represent the ratio of proton to electron energy density , the ratio of particle to magnetic energy density , and volume filling factor , respectively .",
    "however , these are raised to a small power , hence only unlikely , extreme values of these parameters could affect greatly the derived value of @xmath81 .",
    "the models for the x - ray emission from the jet of 0827 + 243 must therefore be consistent with the values or limits to @xmath81 dictated by the observations .",
    "figure 7 shows the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the three most prominent regions in the jet : knot @xmath52 , with the brightest x - ray emission and non - detection at optical and radio frequencies , @xmath24 , with measured x - ray and radio fluxes and optical upper limit , and @xmath44 , detected only in the radio .",
    "the x - ray spectral index , @xmath85 , is significantly flatter than the radio spectral indices , @xmath86 0.7 - 1.1 .",
    "( as discussed above , there are only enough photon counts to determine the x - ray spectral index for all the knots combined .",
    "therefore , it is possible for one knot to have a steeper spectrum , but not all . )",
    "this places further constraints on the emission models , such that a simple power - law energy distribution of a single population of electrons is not viable .",
    "we now discuss models in which the x - ray emission is either synchrotron radiation or upscattered cmb photons .",
    "the seds of @xmath52 and @xmath44 are each consistent with synchrotron emission from a single population of relativistic electrons . however , either the slopes of the electron energy distributions of the two knots are different or the sed contains a hump at x - ray frequencies owing to inefficient inverse compton cooling of cmb photons in the klein - nishina regime @xcite . because the optical upper limit falls below the extrapolation of the radio spectrum , the sed of knot @xmath24 can be fit by synchrotron emission from a single electron population only under the @xcite scheme . in order to fit seds similar to those of knots @xmath52 and @xmath24 , one needs to adopt a very high value ( @xmath87 ) of the `` minimum '' electron lorentz factor @xmath88 .",
    "this can represent either a lower - energy cut - off or the energy above which the power - law energy distribution breaks to a slope steeper than @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , relativistic shock waves should heat electron - proton plasmas to an average thermal energy per particle @xmath90 @xcite , where @xmath91 is the rest mass of a proton and @xmath92 is the bulk lorentz factor of the shock front in the co - moving frame of the unshocked jet .",
    "hence , @xmath93 is expected in the co - moving frame of the emitting plasma .",
    "the main difficulty in applying the @xcite model to 0827 + 243 is the poor match at the low - frequency end of the sed .",
    "knot @xmath24 has a steeper radio spectral index than that of the model seds .",
    "in addition , the low radio flux of knot @xmath52 is expected only for very short times since the onset of particle acceleration , @xmath94 yr as measured in the co - moving frame . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter condition can be met if the bulk lorentz factor @xmath95 , since the measured diameter of @xmath52 of 5 kpc implies a lifetime of at least @xmath96 yr in the co - moving frame .",
    "the seds of the knots of 0827 + 243 then require @xmath97 in order to avoid the dominance of ic / cmb emission over synchrotron radiation at x - ray energies .",
    "alternatively , all of the observed seds could be explained through synchrotron radiation from two populations of relativistic electrons , plausibly associated with jet structure transverse to the axis , as in spine - sheath models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the physical parameters of the plasma corresponding to these two populations are given in table 3 .",
    "they are computed with eq .",
    "( a3 ) under the assumptions that each population is in energy equipartition with the magnetic field ( @xmath98 ) , the kinetic energy in protons and electrons is comparable ( @xmath99 ) , and the emission fills the entire structure ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the simulated seds are shown in figure 7 .",
    "constraints on the spine population are similar to those of the @xcite model , hence @xmath95 is needed and the x - ray spectrum is flattened because the dominant process by which the electrons cool is ic / cmb scattering in the klein - nishina limit . in this case , the energy loss rate depends on electron lorentz factor as @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spine is populated by high - energy electrons with lorentz factors @xmath102 , flat spectral energy distribution , @xmath103 , doppler factor @xmath104 , and low magnetic field , @xmath105 g .",
    "this value of @xmath106 is the minimum capable of producing the observed x - ray flux via the synchrotron mechanism given the derived strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the sheath in this model has @xmath107 and a steep spectral index , @xmath108 , and is less relativistic ( @xmath109 , although this is not well specified in the model ) with a higher magnetic field , @xmath110 20 - 100 @xmath8 g .",
    "the range of possible values of @xmath106 allows the synchrotron power - law spectrum to extend to 15 ghz but not to 420 thz in the optical region .",
    "the value of the minimum electron lorentz factor is uncertain ; that given in table 3 fits the seds without excessive energy requirements .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz instabilities should generate turbulence between the spine and sheath , leading to cooling and deceleration of the spine and an increase in the internal energy of the sheath .",
    "we expect that this could accelerate electrons to achieve a flatter spectrum in the sheath as the turbulence develops along the jet . in this model",
    "the spine produces the x - rays and the sheath generates the radio emission that we observe . since the x - ray and radio emission regions are not co - spatial , the features with detected x - ray and radio emission might appear shifted relative to each other .",
    "an apparent offset of @xmath111 is in fact observed in the case of knot @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which is especially interesting if real because the shift is primarily perpendicular to the jet axis .      inverse compton scattering off cmb photons is a potentially efficient way to produce extended x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "if the mechanism dominates in a kiloparsec - scale jet , as deduced in a number of objects by @xcite , the high - energy photon spectrum is expected to extend up to the @xmath0-ray domain . as is discussed by the above authors ( see also eq .",
    "a5 in appendix a ) , ic / cmb can dominate the x - ray emission if the doppler factor and redshift are high . in the case of the quasar 0827 + 243 , a number of properties of the jet",
    "indicate that the doppler factor remains high out to the x - ray knots : ( 1 ) the x - ray jet aligns with the parsec - scale jet , where highly superluminal apparent speed , @xmath112c , is found @xcite ; ii )",
    "the sharp bend of the x - ray jet is almost surely amplified owing to a small angle between the jet axis and line of sight ( see above ) ; iii ) the decrease of x - ray to radio intensity ratio along the jet can be attributed to deceleration of the jet from an initially very high bulk lorentz factor @xmath64 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "figure 8 shows the observed and simulated seds for components @xmath113 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the simulated seds are combined synchrotron and ic / cmb emission from a single population of relativistic electrons with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the value of @xmath116 should not be higher and @xmath117 should not be lower than the indicated values , otherwise we would expect these knots to be detected at optical wavelengths",
    ". the value of @xmath117 can not be grater than 15 without causing the low - frequency cutoff to the x - ray spectrum to exceed the soft band of our _ chandra _ observation . because we have no measurements of @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the same feature ( knots @xmath23 and @xmath24 are too faint to estimate the x - ray spectral index separately from @xmath120 and @xmath52 ) , we consider that @xmath121 , as expected for ic / cmb emission when the same power - law distribution of scattering electrons also produces the radio emission .",
    "we could also obtain @xmath118 flatter than @xmath119 if we were to assume that the electron energy distribution breaks from a slope of @xmath122 below @xmath123 to a slope steeper than @xmath124 at higher energies ; see the previous section .",
    "the ic / cmb x - ray model combined with synchrotron radio emission allows us to estimate the parameters of the jet using eq .",
    "( a7 ) , ( a5 ) , and ( a3 ) .",
    "equation ( a7 ) provides an estimate for ( or limit to ) the ratio @xmath125 , while eq .",
    "( a3 ) and ( a5 ) give the values of ( or limits to ) the products @xmath81 and @xmath126 for the radio synchrotron and x - ray ic / cmb emission , respectively .",
    "table 4 presents the parameters derived for each jet feature .",
    "the model fits the observed spectral energy distribution quite well ( fig .",
    "8) except that the x - ray spectrum of knot @xmath24 is much steeper than the combined spectrum of all the x - ray knots .",
    "this can be accommodated by the data , since @xmath24 contains only about 18% of the x - ray flux from the extended jet .",
    "it is also consistent with low - energy flattening of the electron energy distribution , as discussed above .",
    "knot @xmath52 has marginally detected radio emission at 5  ghz ( fig .",
    "4 ) that matches the flux of the model sed .",
    "one striking property of the model is that the doppler factor @xmath127 of x - ray features @xmath128 , and @xmath52 coincides with the estimate of the parsec - scale @xmath127 based on the apparent speed .",
    "moreover , since the x - ray and parsec - scale radio jets lie in the same direction , there is no evidence of bending that would change the angle @xmath129 between the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "this strongly implies that the bulk lorentz factor remains constant from parsec to kiloparsec scales and that the magnetic field is very low , @xmath130 , upstream of the bend .",
    "these conclusions would be modified somewhat if a dual population of electrons were to exist in a given knot such that the x - rays were a roughly equal combination of synchrotron and ic / cmb emission . in this case ,",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 @xmath8 g would be possible before the bend .",
    "it is doubtful , however , that such a balance between the two emission mechanisms would occur for all three knots upstream of the bend .",
    "according to the model parameters , deceleration of the jet does occur after the sharp bend beyond component @xmath52 , as anticipated from hydrodynamic considerations .",
    "the decrease in bulk lorentz factor is accompanied by intensification of the magnetic field .",
    "as has been discussed by @xcite , this is expected for a decelerating relativistic jet , since the magnetic field in the co - moving frame of the emitting plasma @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the magnetic field in the rest frame of the host galaxy of the quasar .",
    "we note that these inferences are independent of the nature of the x - ray emission , but do assume that the equipartition condition holds .",
    "the significant change in the projected direction of the jet implies that the variation in @xmath127 is influenced both by a decrease in @xmath64 and a change in @xmath65 .",
    "the apparent bending requires a change @xmath135 , but it would be difficult to deflect a powerful , highly relativistic jet by more than a few degrees while conserving momentum .",
    "hence , we can assume that the new viewing angle @xmath65(post - bend ) @xmath136 .",
    "as shown in figure 9 , the value of @xmath64 after the bend is then roughly equal to half the doppler factor . therefore , the decrease in the doppler factor is primarily a consequence of deceleration of the jet flow .",
    "further evidence for deceleration of the jet flow is found in the shift between the x - ray and radio positions of component @xmath23 and in the existence of an extended radio tail downstream of knot @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of a decelerating jet ( cf . fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the required kinetic luminosities of the x - ray emitting knots are high , but perhaps possible for a powerful jet , @xmath137 erg s@xmath31 for @xmath23 , @xmath138 erg s@xmath31 for @xmath24 , and less for the others , when the bulk kinetic energy of the protons is included .",
    "these values argue that the jet can not be far from equipartition between the energy density of relativistic electrons and that of the magnetic field .",
    "otherwise , the required luminosities would be excessive ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", this can explain the flat x - ray spectra alongside the steeper radio spectra .",
    "the relatively flat x - ray spectrum of the extended jet of 0827 + 243 is consistent with synchrotron radiation from extremely high - energy electrons under the @xcite scenario or within a dual population ( e.g. , spine - sheath ) model .",
    "it can also be explained by inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by @xmath5 electrons if the energy distribution of the electrons is relatively flat below @xmath143 and steeper above this value .",
    "all models require very high doppler factors , consistent with the value @xmath144 inferred from the parsec - scale superluminal apparent motion , and very low magnetic field ( @xmath145 ) upstream of the bend situated 5@xmath2 from the core .",
    "the implication is that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet flow maintains its high value all the way from parsec scales to @xmath146 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "beyond this point , the jet bends by about @xmath74 projected on the sky and at least @xmath147 in three dimensions . in the ic / cmb model , the flow decelerates while the magnetic field intensifies at and beyond the bend .",
    "the latter follows the expectations of the model of @xcite , although the jump in field strength at the bend is about 4 times greater than the model predicts .",
    "this is in line with the supposition that a standing shock accompanies the bend in the flow .    in the ic / cmb case and in most of the synchrotron models ,",
    "the energetics of the jet are reasonable if the energy distribution of the electrons is less steep than @xmath148 below a rather high value of @xmath0 , @xmath149 .",
    "such high break energies are consistent with particle acceleration by relativistic shocks .",
    "other possible processes for producing high values of @xmath88 are discussed by @xcite . as mentioned by @xcite ,",
    "the @xcite proposal predicts that the sizes of x - ray knots should be smaller than those of optical knots owing to the more sever energy losses of x - ray emitting electrons .",
    "however , we detect no optical knots in 0827 + 243 , and hence can not apply this test with our current data .",
    "the flat spectrum of the x - ray jet features suggests that the maximum energy output of the knots could occur in the @xmath0-ray domain , perhaps up to the tev region ( @xmath150  hz ) , although this emission is difficult to observe .",
    "tev photons from such a high redshift ( @xmath151 ) will pair - produce off cosmic infrared photons before reaching the earth .",
    "in addition , current @xmath0-ray detectors have insufficient resolution to isolate any emission from the extended jet , and the nuclear emission probably dominates the total @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0-ray flux should not be observed to drop below the expected level if the models are valid . at lower frequencies , synchrotron and , for knots with low values of @xmath127 , ic / cmb emission could contribute substantial amounts of optical and infrared flux from the jet in 0827 + 243 .",
    "observations in these wavebands could define the lower and/or upper cutoffs of the relativistic electron energy distributions , thereby removing one of the remaining ambiguities in our analysis .",
    "if the dominant contribution to the observed flux density at a given frequency can be identified as synchrotron radiation , we can relate the magnetic field strength @xmath152 and doppler factor @xmath127 to observed parameters as follows .",
    "based on the formulas given in @xcite , @xcite expressed the synchrotron flux density @xmath153 at frequency @xmath154 as @xmath155 where @xmath156 is tabulated in table a1 , @xmath157 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath158 and @xmath39 define the electron energy distribution , @xmath159 .",

    "the ic / cmb flux density varies as @xmath192 .",
