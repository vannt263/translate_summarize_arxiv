    "the fractional quantum hall states have a lasting fascination due to their nontrivial topological properties , which lie beyond the paradigm of the fermi - liquid theory , and the potential applications in topological quantum computation  @xcite . probing excitations at the edge of a fqh droplet is the most accessible approach for the detection of the topological properties in the bulk thanks to the edge - bulk correspondence in the topological system . the edge excitations are gapless in the thermodynamic limit , contrast to gapped quasihole / quasiparticle excitations in the bulk . owing to the existence of edge states , current exists between two contacts connected by an edge channel as",
    "electrons can be injected into or removed from the fqh edge without costing energy .",
    "the standard theory for the fqh edge physics is the chiral luttinger liquid ( cll ) theory  @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts that a fqh droplet exhibits power - law bahavior in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics ( @xmath3 ) when electrons are tunneling through a barrier into the edge , e.g. , from a three - dimensional fermi liquid . for the celebrated laughlin state at a filling factor @xmath4 in the lowest landau level ,",
    "the cll theory predicts a tunneling exponent @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath6 measured in experiments are sample dependent with a numerical value smaller than 3 , which are nonuniversal  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible causes of this discrepancy is existence of counterpropagating edge modes , which result from edge reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "the edge reconstruction in the electron density profile manifests the competition between electron - electron interaction , which tends to spread out the electron density , and the electrostatic confinement at the edge , which holds the electrons in the interior of the sample .",
    "numerical calculations  @xcite indicate that the edge reconstruction in fqh states is unavoidable in the state - of - art gaas - based samples based on modulation doping , which greatly enhances sample mobility but unintentionally introduces a large region of fringe field at the edge that favors edge electron redistribution .",
    "this effect hinders the observation of the universal behavior in edge transport .    in recent years new two - dimensional materials , such as graphene , emerged .",
    "the fqh effect has already been observed in graphene  @xcite .",
    "however , integer and fractional quantum hall effects in graphene differ from those in normal semiconductor - based devices , because electrons in graphene obey the relativistic dirac equation , instead of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation often encountered in solid state materials .",
    "here we compare the fqh states in both gaas - based samples and in graphene samples with the emphasis on the difference of the competition at the edge .",
    "we find that there is an experimental accessible parameter region in graphene - based samples , in which edge reconstruction can be avoided and , therefore , universal fqh edge physics can be observed .",
    "the universality is reflected in the calculation of the equal - time edge green s function , which is related to the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics in edge tunneling .",

    "an experimental sample based on a modulation - doped gaas / gaalas heterostructure  @xcite can be simplified to a two - dimensional electron layer , which is located at the interface between gaas and gaalas , and a homogeneous positive background charge layer , which originates from the remote dopants .",

    "the confinement potential for electrons due to background charge competes with the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "this competition is the driving force for edge reconstruction .",
    "the density of the background charge @xmath7 is determined by the electron filling factor @xmath8 due to charge neutrality and , therefore , the background confinement potential is a single - body potential in the fqh hamiltonian .",

    "we find an exponent @xmath42  @xcite at @xmath43 @xmath44 , which is consistent with the cll theory prediction .",
    "the exponent for the variational laughlin wavefunction is the same as that of the coulomb ground state before reconstruction .",
    "however , when @xmath45 @xmath46 , the exponent @xmath47 is noticeably smaller than @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that the long - range coulomb interaction does not directly lead to nonuniversal edge behavior , but the consequence of its competition with the confinement potential , i.e. , edge reconstruction , does . in a typical gaas - based sample , @xmath14 is of order 1000 @xmath49 , i.e. , about 10 @xmath50  @xcite . while the numerical calculation for such a large @xmath14 is not practical due to the system - size constraint , we speculate that multiple edge reconstructions can occur , leading to more than three counterpropagating edge modes .",

    "[ grahenell](a ) , the eigenenergy of the lowest landau level increases rapidly as approaching the open edge , which keeps electrons from spreading out .",
    "since in the disk geometry the @xmath11th orbital is located at @xmath69 along the radial direction , the landau orbitals closer to the edge are denser than those closer to the center .",
    "the edge potential influences a large portion of the orbitals in the momentum space .",
    "therefore , in a finite - size calculation we need to include significantly more orbitals than needed for the laughlin state to prevent the edge potential from destroying the bulk properties .    in fig .",
    "[ grahenell](b ) we plot the ground - state angular momentum for 8 electrons in 32 orbitals as a function of @xmath14 .",

    "[ gsn8](b ) , in which the laughlin phase remains stable down to @xmath71 .",
    "this is because that the interaction is too weak to compete with the edge potential when @xmath14 is sufficiently small , thus electrons are repelled from the edge and the ground - state angular momentum decreases . strictly speaking",
    ", a fair comparison requires us to use a sharp cutoff in real space in the gaas model as well , such that the single - particle energy bends up and one needs to introduce landau level mixing in a more complete treatment ( see ref .",

    "the upper bound of the window in which the unreconstructed laughlin phase can be realized in the graphene model agrees well with that in the gaas model  @xcite .",
    "however , in the graphene model , e.g. , on boron nitride substrate between the graphene layer and the gate , the parameter @xmath14 can be chosen as small as a few nanometers or a small fraction of @xmath50  @xcite , thus the universal exponent in tunneling experiments may be easily accessible in graphene .",

    "the edge mode is not well separated from other states in the spectrum ( similar to fig . 8 in ref .",
