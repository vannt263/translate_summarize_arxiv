    "we prove that if a graph @xmath4 lacks certain induced cycles , the vertex decomposability and ( sequentially ) cohen - macaulayness of @xmath4 relies upon the codismantlability of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , such an approach also permits to read off the castelnuovo - mumford regularity of such graphs combinatorially , and enables us to discuss how tight the previously known upper bounds could be .",

    "most of recent research focuses on finding combinatorial properties of graphs that guaranty ( sequentially ) cohen - macaulayness of @xmath29 as well as enable us to compute some invariants , such as the castelnuovo - mumford regularity , of @xmath29 combinatorially .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for an excellent recent survey on the subject .",
    "topological combinatorics enters the picture via the stanley - reisner correspondence .",
    "recall that the _ independence complex _ @xmath30 of a graph @xmath4 is the simplicial complex on @xmath31 whose faces are independent sets of @xmath4 . in this context",
    ", @xmath29 is the stanley - reisner ring of @xmath30 .",
    "this assignment brings to use of topological combinatorial methods such as shellability and vertex decomposability created to analyze the structure of stanley - reisner rings of simplicial complexes not necessarily those arisen from graphs .",
    "it seems that such methods are well adapted , and almost all existing characterizations of graphs with ( sequentially ) cohen - macaulay edge rings involve these notions .",
    "it has been shown that the vertex decomposability of a graph @xmath4 ( in fact , that of @xmath30 ) and ( sequentially ) cohen - macaulayness of @xmath29 are equivalent if the graph @xmath4 is a member of the family of bipartite graphs  @xcite or chordal graphs  @xcite or very well - covered graphs  @xcite . a detail look at their proofs reveals that the vertex decomposability of these graphs are of special kind .",
    "indeed , if a vertex decomposable graph belongs to one of these graph classes with at least one edge , then it has a shedding vertex @xmath0 satisfying that the closed neighborhood set of one of its neighbors is contained in that of @xmath0 .",
    "such an observation naturally raises a simple question : what conditions on a given graph do guaranty that its shedding vertices ( if any ) satisfy this property ?",
    "we obtain a complete answer to this question by proving that if a graph lacks induced cycles of length four and five , any of its shedding vertices must be of this type .",
    "this also allows us to introduce a graph class , _ codismantlable graphs _ , defined recursively ( see definition  [ defn : codis ] ) .    in most cases , our method of proofs has a combinatorial nature . in section two",
    ", we introduce codismantlable graphs , and reveal some of their combinatorial properties .",
    "we remark that there is no direct relation between the classes of codismantlable and _ dismantlable _ graphs , so our terminology is just a coincidence stemming from the relevance of their defining relations .",
    "we recall that a vertex @xmath32 of a graph @xmath4 is said to be _ dominated _ by a vertex @xmath33 if @xmath34\\subseteq n_g[v]$ ] , and a graph @xmath4 is called a dismantlable graph if either it consists of a single vertex or it has a dominated vertex @xmath32 such that @xmath35 is dismantlable @xcite . however , there are dismantlable graphs that are not codismantlable , and vise verse .",
    "for instance , the wheel graph @xmath36 for @xmath19 is an example of a dismantlable graph that is not codismantlable , and the pan graph @xmath37 for @xmath38 is a codismantlable graph which is not dismantlable .",
    "moreover , they are not complementary graph classes , that is , the complement of a codismantlable graph need not be a dismantlable graph and vise verse .",
    "we there prove that when a well - covered graph @xmath4 is @xmath7-free , then its vertex decomposability , codismantlability and cohen - macaulayness are all equivalent . in a similar vein , we show that if @xmath4 is a well - covered graph with @xmath39 , then @xmath4 is vertex decomposable if and only if it is cohen - macaulay .",
    "the section three deals with the castelnuovo - mumford regularity of codismantlable graphs .",
    "we prove that the regularity of a @xmath6-free vertex decomposable graph equals to its induced matching number .",
    "furthermore , we show that the co - chordal cover number of a graph of girth at least five equals to the domination number of its line graph .",
    "we there also present an example showing that there exist connected graphs such that their co - chordal cover numbers could be far from their regularities .    in the final section ,",
    "we associate a ( simple ) graph to any given digraph , the _ common - enemy graph _ , and prove that common - enemy graphs are always vertex decomposable and codismantlable provided that source digraphs are acyclic .",

    "meantime , we will discuss some problems related to our present work that we have not been able to clarify so far .",
    "indeed , what we are really asking whether theorem  [ thm : tri - unmixed ] remains true when a graph is not necessarily @xmath7-free . at this point , it is also reasonable to ask under what conditions on a codismantlable graph @xmath4 , we may guarantee that @xmath9 .",
