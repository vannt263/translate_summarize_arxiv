    "massive protostars are still embedded in their natal molecular material , and due to the high extinction are traditionally observed in the radio / mm and infrared wavelength bands .",

    "in particular , the arc - second resolution imaging capability of the chandra x - ray observatory has allowed for the detection of young , and hence embedded , massive stars in a number of the nearest massive star forming regions ( e.g. townsley 2006 ) . here",
    "we present the results of chandra observations of the iras@xmath120126 + 4104 region , which contains a massive protostar , i.e. a massive star that is still in the process of assembling most of its final mass through accretion from its envelope . a small number of low - mass ` class 0 ' type protostars have been detected in x - rays ( e.g. tsuboi et al .",
    "2001 ) and the observations presented in this paper were carried out to search for x - ray emission from similar , but more massive objects .    the iras@xmath120126 + 4104 region of massive star formation has been studied extensively in the last few years .",

    "these authors discuss the possible origin of the radio continuum sources , and while the detailed nature of the radio continuum sources is still under debate , they favor a model for i20n1 and n2 where the ionization is shock - induced by the outflow from the putative massive proto - star , located about @xmath23 to the south - east of i20n1 . for i20s , on the other hand , the radio continuum data are consistent with direct photo - ionization of jet material from an early b - type star .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain x - ray emission from early type stars : shocks in line driven winds in the outer atmosphere of the star ( e.g. , lucy & white 1980 ) , magnetically confined stellar winds ( gagn et al . 2005 ) , collisions of strong winds in close binary systems ( e.g. , pittard & parkin 2010 ) , and binary induced magnetic reconnection events ( schultz et al .",

    "the @xmath54 probability for constancy was 0.4 , indicating no variation of its x - ray flux was detected .",

    "all models were also run allowing the abundance to vary .",
    "none of these models fit the data well , however all models imply similar absorption columns of about @xmath56@xmath9 , as well as the presence of a hot plasma with kt@xmath57kev .    in figure  4 ( upper panel ) , we show an overlay of our best fit model , which consists of an absorbed 1 t apec model plus three gaussians .",
    "the best fit model parameters are an absorbing column of n@xmath58@xmath9 , a plasma energy of kt@xmath59kev , and an abundance of 1.2 solar .",
    "two of the three gaussians lines were added to represent energies of 3.9 and @xmath60kev , which are likely due to ca@xmath1xix .",
    "whether in fact these lines are actually present in the data can not be stated with any certainty due to the low signal - to - noise ratio , but their presence improves the fit and similar emission lines have been reported in the class i protostar wl22 in @xmath61-ophiuchi ( imanishi & koyama 2001 ; see also maggio et al .",

    "emission from the fe@xmath1xxv ( he - like ) ion is expected at an energy of @xmath62kev , and the spectrum of i20s shows excess emission near this energy .",
    "however , the emission appears quite broad , and we add the third gaussian at an energy of @xmath63kev , which represents emission from weakly ionized iron .    while i20s is the second brightest x - ray source in the iras@xmath12016 + 4104 region , its emission is still fairly weak and provides only a total of 167 x - ray photons , which does not allow strong constraints on spectral modeling .",
    "we thus do not consider the model presented above as fully representative of the physical state of the x - ray emitting plasma in i20s .",
    "the most significant results of the model fit are the absorption column density , as well as the broad emission complex around the iron line energies , implying emission from both weakly ionized , and he - like iron .",
    "the observed ( i.e. absorbed ) @xmath32kev flux of i20s is @xmath64erg@xmath1@xmath65s@xmath6 , and the unabsorbed luminosity is about @xmath10erg@xmath1s@xmath6 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of i20var is shown in figure  4 ( lower panel ) .",

    "we estimate that n@xmath67 is accurate within about a factor of 2 , but the plasma temperature is less well constrained ; reasonable fits were possible with any energy larger than about @xmath68kev .",
    "the observed @xmath32kev flux of i20var is @xmath69erg@xmath1@xmath65s@xmath6 , corresponding to an unabsorbed luminosity of approximately @xmath13erg@xmath1s@xmath6 .",
    "we first turn to the non - detection of x - rays from the position of the massive protostar i20n . as has been pointed out by skinner et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , very few massive embedded stars have been detected in x - rays and little is known about their x - ray emission during early evolutionary stages . among the candidates for massive protostars which have been detected",
    "are the well known sources hh80 - 81 ( ggd27-x , pravdo et al .",
    "2009 ) , s106-irs4 ( giardino et al . 2004 ) , ngc2071-irs1 , irs3 ( skinner et al . 2009 ) , and several sources in the monr2 region ( kohno , koyama & hamaguchi et al .",
    "these sources show relatively hard spectra with energies in the range of @xmath70kev , observed through column densities @xmath71@xmath9 and unabsorbed x - ray luminosities of @xmath72erg@xmath1s@xmath6 .",
    "translating our detection limit of 7 counts to physical parameters is model dependent : for an optically thin thermal spectrum with an energy of @xmath73kev , and absorption column of n@xmath74@xmath9 , our detection limit corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of about @xmath75erg@xmath1s@xmath6 in the @xmath32kev energy band . as the column density increases",
    ", much more luminous sources would be required for detection , e.g. l@xmath76erg@xmath1s@xmath6 for n@xmath77@xmath9 , and l@xmath78erg@xmath1s@xmath6 for n@xmath79@xmath9 .",
    "i20n is located near the column density maximum in the iras@xmath120126 + 4104 core region , where cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate n@xmath80@xmath9 .",
    "thus , at present , the non - detection of i20n in x - rays is consistent with the x - ray properties of known massive protostellar candidates if the hypothetical x - ray source in i20n suffers the full extent of the absorption through the column density of 10@xmath81 @xmath9 .",
    "this source is located about @xmath21 south of i20n near the edge of the dense central core .",
    "no compact emission in any molecular transition or dust continuum has been reported at this position ; the only detection so far is at @xmath22 cm ( hofner et al .",
    "2007 ) . at this wavelength ,",
    "the source shows a smooth elongated structure of axis ratio @xmath82 oriented in the direction of the large scale flow ( figure  1 ) , which has been interpreted by hofner et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as either a photoionized jet or shock ionization due to outflowing matter .",
    "the detailed evolutionary state of i20s is difficult to assess .",
    "most existing models for jets are based on collimated disk winds ( e.g. pudritz et al . 2007 ) , hence the presence of a radio jet inside the dense molecular cloud core suggests that an accretion disk might exist around the central object in i20s .",
    "however , the absence of any detectable , compact , high density tracer suggests that the total mass of such a putative disk , and the accretion rate would be substantially lower than in i20n .",
    "if the radio continuum emission from i20s is due to ionizing photons beamed into the solid angle of the jet , the required uv photon flux corresponds to a zams spectral type b1 ( hofner et al .",
    "this spectral type is likely an upper limit since a high velocity jet might produce a significant fraction of the ionizing radiation .",
    "accretion onto the stellar surface of such an object even at free - fall velocities would result in a spectrum with e@xmath83kev ( gnther et al .",
    "2007 ) , i.e. much softer than is observed .",
    "one scenario which can produce plasmas with energies of several kev is strong shocks , which can occur when the outflowing matter in the jet is stopped by the surrounding dense gas in the molecular core ( e.g. raga , noriega - crespo & velazquez 2002 ) .",
    "as discussed above , the energy of the x - ray emitting plasma of i20s is poorly determined , but it is likely larger than @xmath84kev .",
    "shock speeds @xmath85km@xmath1s@xmath6 are required to produce a plasma of this energy .",
    "terminal wind speeds of early b stars can be of this magnitude ( e.g. cassinelli et al .",
    "1994 ) , and proper motions within the hh80 - 81 jet as large as @xmath86km@xmath1s@xmath6 have been detected ( marti , rodriguez & reipurth 1995 ) , so this scenario is a distinct possibility .",
    "the radio morphology of i20 is reminiscent of the jet in the classical t - tauri star dg tau which is also known to be an x - ray emitter ( gdel etal .",
    "2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "however the x - ray emission from i20s arises from a much hotter plasma , suffering much higher extinction , and is more luminous than dg tau , so that i20s might be an upscaled version of dg tau .    for lower mass stars ,",
    "hard x - rays are produced mostly by magnetic reconnection events which heat the plasma to high temperatures ( e.g. feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) , and similar processes have recently been detected for massive stars ( schulz et al .",
    "this type of emission usually occurs in x - ray outbursts with a typical flare profile in the lightcurve . while there is evidence for marginal variability of the x - ray flux from i20s",
    ", no flare - type variability is seen .",
    "this type of flux variation is more likely related either to the rotation of the star or to orbital modulation in a binary . for the former case , a possible production mechanism for hard x - ray emission would be the magnetically confined wind model ( gagne et al .",
    "2005 ) , and for the latter case , the colliding binary wind model ( e.g. pittard & parkin 2010 ) .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the emission line at @xmath63kev .",
    "this line is due to weakly ionized iron indicating the presence of relatively cold gas .",
    "following the theory outlined in tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , if the fluorescent matter is along the line of sight to i20s , an order of magnitude estimate for the equivalent width ( ew ) of the @xmath63kev line is ew@xmath87(n@xmath88/@xmath89@xmath90ev , where n@xmath88 is the equivalent hydrogen column in the fluorescent material .",
    "the absorption column measured from model fitting the i20s x - ray spectrum is n@xmath91@xmath9 .",
    "based on the iram plateau de bure @xmath92 mm observations ( @xmath93 ) of cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the formulas of mezger et al .",
    "( 1990 ) with an assumed dust temperature of @xmath94k , we estimate a column density of n@xmath95@xmath9 at the position of i20s . considering the uncertainties ( angular resolution , dust properties and assumed temperature ) ,",
    "this value is consistent with the absorption derived from the x - ray spectrum .",
    "thus , the expected ew of the @xmath63kev iron line is on the order of a few times @xmath96ev , whereas much larger values for ew are necessary to explain the excess in the spectrum near @xmath63kev , suggesting a much higher column density for the fluorescent matter .",
    "as noted above , i20s is located near the edge of the dense molecular core , which contains the massive protostar i20n .",
    "a likely scenario is therefore that the @xmath63kev line arises from reflection of x - ray emission from i20s at the edge of the dense molecular core .",
    "however the low count - rate of the i20s spectrum precludes a more detailed analysis and more sensitive observations are needed to study the putative @xmath63kev line .",
    "this source was first detected by hofner et al .",
    "( 2007 ) at radio wavelengths , where it showed strong variability on time scales of @xmath97 days or longer .",
    "the emission characteristics of i20var are consistent with gyro - synchrotron emission from a low mass , pre - main sequence star , which infrared emission is made undetectable by an overlaying column of about n@xmath77@xmath9 .",
    "our x - ray data imply the same amount of absorption from fitting the low energy cutoff .    with the exception of a possible flare onset at the end of these observations ,",
    "the emission from i20var appears mostly quiescent ( figure  3 , bottom ) rather than flare - like .",
    "the luminosity of quiescent x - ray emission from low mass pre - main sequence stars is generally found to be smaller than a few times @xmath98erg@xmath1s@xmath6 ( e.g. imanishi et al . 2001 ) , whereas i20var has an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of approximately @xmath13erg@xmath1s@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that i20var is either a low mass star with unusually high quiescent x - ray emission , or that it is an intermediate mass star .",
    "in this paper , we described chandra observations of the iras@xmath120126 + 4104 core region .",
    "the massive protostar i20n was not detected in our observations .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity of this source is similar to the massive protostars detected so far , then the non - detection indicates that the x - ray emission suffers the full extent of the absorption toward i20n , which is thought to be dominated by an edge - on accretion disk .",
    "x - ray emission was detected from the radio jet source i20s .",
    "the source was marginally variable , but showed no evidence of x - ray flares .",
    "the emission has a hard and strongly absorbed spectrum , showing a broad line between 6.4 and 6.7kev .",
    "the line is consistent with a superposition of emission from both weakly , and highly ionized iron .",
    "also , x - ray emission from the variable radio source i20var was detected .",
    "the x - ray emission from this source was constant during the observations , with a larger x - ray luminosity than would be expected from a low mass pre - main sequence star .",
    "together with detection limits from 2mass , this suggests that i20var is possibly an intermediate mass star .",
