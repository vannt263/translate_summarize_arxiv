    "the unusual magnetic properties of the stacked triangular antiferromagnet ( staf ) cufeo@xmath5 have been the subject of considerable investigation and speculation over the past several decades , especially since the recent discovery of an unconventional magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling induced by relatively weak magnetic field .",
    "@xcite the focus of the present work is on the surprising sequence of magnetic states which occur at low temperature with increasing field strength applied along the hexagonal c - axis .",
    "@xcite these can be characterized with the following spin polarization vectors @xmath6 and in - plane periodicities : linearly polarized @xmath7 period-4 ( p4 ) , helically polarized @xmath8 incommensurate ( ic ) , linearly polarized @xmath7 period-5 ( p5 ) , axial and canted @xmath6 period-3 ( p3 ) phases .",
    "although the rhombohedral r@xmath9 m crystal symmetry present at temperatures above the onset of linearly polarized @xmath7 ic magnetic order in zero field at @xmath10=14  k allows for axial magnetic anisotropy , usual spin - orbit coupling is absent in the s=5/2 , l=0 magnetic state of the @xmath11 ions . @xcite",
    "( the extent to which hund s rules apply to this semiconductor with non - trivial electronic structure @xcite may be questioned . )",
    "anisotropy may thus be expected to be small so that the origin of stability of the axial phases is not obvious .",
    "the existence of such a wide variety of magnetic states with different periodicities in this compound is in contrast with the other weakly axial staf s such as csnicl@xmath12 which show only period-3 phases and a typical spin - flop transition .",
    "@xcite neutron scattering experiments also indicate a period - two modulation of the magnetic order in cufeo@xmath5 along the c - axis of the corresponding hexagonal unit cell suggesting substantial antiferromagnetic ( af ) interplane coupling .",
    "@xcite such a complex phase diagram defies explanation through a model hamiltonian based on conventional magnetic interactions .",
    "remarkably , some important aspects of the magnetic ordering ( e.g. , stability of p4 and p5 states ) have been accounted for by a model 2d triangular ising af with very large second and third - neighbor exchange interactions , @xmath13=0.45 and @xmath14=0.75 , respectively , where @xmath15 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchange .",
    "@xcite the physical origin of these unusually long - ranged exchange effects is unknown , @xcite but there is evidence from perturbed angular correlation measurements that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are substantial .",
    "@xcite analysis of the model proposed here demonstrates the importance of inter - plane coupling , @xmath18 , @xcite for stabilizing the p4 state with smaller values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , an effect which has been found in other frustrated systems .",
    "@xcite    it has also been emphasized that spin - lattice coupling is an important effect in cufeo@xmath5 , as observed in magnetostriction @xcite and in the pressure dependence of @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite such interactions are also believed to be relevant for the structural phase transition to monoclinic @xmath20 symmetry which occurs as the temperature is lowered to about 11  k. it is near this temperature @xmath21 that a discontinuous magnetic phase transition from the linear ic phase to the ground state p4 ordered structure occurs .",
    "@xcite it is of interest to note that although the type of magnetic order is quite different , a similar @xmath22 - @xmath23 structural phase transition in solid @xmath24 has been shown to be driven by magnetoelastic coupling . @xcite magnetoelastic coupling is known to give rise to biquadratic _",

    "key to understanding the magnetic phase diagram of cufeo@xmath5 is the occurrence of an induced electric polarization @xmath28 in the ic spin - flop phase .",

    "<S> biquadratic _ antisymmetric _ exchange terms of the form @xmath0 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the unit vector connecting sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 , due partially to magnetoelectric coupling effects , are shown to be responsible for the spin - flop helical phase in cufeo@xmath5 at low magnetic field and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> usual biquadratic _ symmetric _ exchange , likely due to magnetoelastic coupling , is found to support the stability of axial magnetic states at higher fields in this nearly - heisenberg like stacked triangular antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> a model hamiltonian which also includes substantial interplane and higher - neighbor intraplane exchange interactions , reproduces the unique series of observed commensurate and incommensurate periodicity phases with increasing applied magnetic field in this highly frustrated system . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field - temperature phase diagram is discussed in terms of a landau - type free energy . </S>"
