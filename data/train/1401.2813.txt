    ", we obtain a similar result :    we remark that the special case of theorem  [ thmspheresintrod ] where the singular set @xmath6 of @xmath7 is empty is a classical result of meeks  @xcite .",
    "also , we note that in the statement of the above theorem , we made no assumption on the regularity of the foliation @xmath7 . however , the proofs in this paper require that @xmath7 has bounded second fundamental form on compact sets of @xmath16 or @xmath4 minus the singular set @xmath6 .",

    "the existence of such foliations follows from the next main theorem in  @xcite and the facts that every closed three - manifold has a differentiable structure and the euler characteristic of any closed manifold of odd dimension is always zero ; the proof of this theorem relies heavily on the seminal works of thurston  @xcite on the existence of smooth codimension - one foliations of smooth closed @xmath57-manifolds and of sullivan  @xcite , which explains when such foliations are minimal with respect to some riemannian metric .",
