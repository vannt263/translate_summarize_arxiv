    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) has been central to explaining various fundamental aspects of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of a system of weakly interacting bosons @xcite .",
    "one of the hallmarks of this system is the dark soliton that has been theoretically predicted @xcite as a unidirectional traveling wave solution for the condensate density in the case of weakly repulsive bosons .",
    "this soliton , which dies out when its speed approaches the speed of sound , has also been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the study of solitary wave propagation in bec remains an active frontier with special emphasis on non - gpe dynamics@xcite , as well as many - body effects such as quantum fluctuations and depletion that can not be described by gpe@xcite .",
    "the complex order parameter ( i.e. , the condensate wave function ) describing a bec that satisfies the gpe can be identified with the bosonic coherent state average @xcite of the boson annihilation operator in the continuum version of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "analogously , in a strongly interacting limit described by a system of hard - core bosons ( hcb ) the appropriate order parameter for this system would be the spin coherent state average @xcite as the system maps to a pseudospin model @xcite . in the continuum description of the dynamics of the extended lattice bose - hubbard model for hard - core bosons with nearest neighbor interactions",
    ", this order parameter satisfies an evolution equation that is different from the gpe @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this equation as the hgpe , where the prefix `` h '' has been used to denote its connection to hcb .",
    "unlike the gpe which describes the dynamics of a bec with no depletion , the hgpe evolution encodes both the normal and condensate fractions in the bose system . in our recent study , we showed that the hgpe supports @xcite both a dark soliton and an antidark@xcite soliton ( i.e. , a bright soliton on a pedestal ) for the bosonic density .",
    "in other words , the dark soliton of the bec of weakly repulsive bosons acquires a partner that is bright , when the repulsion becomes extremely strong .",
    "apart from being bright , the anti - dark soliton is found to be of quite a distinct variety compared to the dark soliton that resembles the gpe soliton .",
    "away from half - filling , i.e. , when there is a nonvanishing particle - hole imbalance in the background , the dark soliton dies out when its propagation speed approaches the speed of sound ( like the gpe soliton ) , while its brighter partner is found to persist all the way up to the sound velocity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at half - filling , when the particle - hole imbalance is zero , the dark and the antidark solitons in the particle density profile of the hgpe become mirror images of each other , and they both die out at the sound velocity .",
    "interestingly , in the corresponding condensate density , the two solitons become degenerate and cease to exist as separate entities . in this special case ,",
    "the condensate density profile is a dark soliton that dies out as its speed approaches the speed of sound @xcite .    in this paper , we show that for the half - filled case , the localized functional form of the solitary wave solution for the density of the hard - core bosonic condensate described by the hgpe agrees with that of the dark soliton of the gpe , to a very good approximation . in other words , if one focuses on the condensate fraction of the hard - core bosonic system , this strongly repulsive bose gas supports a solitary wave that has almost the same profile as the gpe soliton that describes the bec of a weakly repulsive bose gas .",
    "furthermore , since the hcb gas in the spin coherent state formulation of the extended bose - hubbard model with nearest neighbor interactions mimics an anisotropic , easy - plane ferromagnetic chain , the well known dark soliton of the gpe also relates to the magnetic soliton in the easy - plane ferromagnet , where it describes the profile of the _ square of the in - plane magnetization_.    in section ii , we begin with the many - body bose - hubbard hamiltonian that describes the low - energy behavior of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice , and briefly outline some steps that lead to the order parameter equations in the weakly and strongly interacting limits , respectively . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we first derive the evolution equation for the traveling waves in the condensate fraction of the atomic cloud obtained from the hgpe , and show that to a very good approximation , this equation agrees with the corresponding equation derived from the gpe . in section",
    "v , we discuss the relationship between the density solitons of the bec and the magnetic solitons of an easy - plane ferromagnet .",
    "we begin with the extended lattice bose - hubbard model in @xmath0 dimensions , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath1\\\\+\\sum_j u n_{j }    ( n_{j}-1 )   -(\\mu-2t)n_{j } , \\label { bh}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the creation and annihilation operators for a boson at the lattice site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the number operator , @xmath6 labels nearest - neighbor ( nn ) separation , @xmath7 is the nn hopping parameter , @xmath8 is the on - site repulsion strength , and @xmath9 is the chemical potential . to soften the effect of strong onsite repulsion , we add an attractive nn interaction ( @xmath10 ) ( although our results will be valid for repulsive @xmath11 as well as for @xmath12 ) .",
    "such a term may mimic certain characteristics of the long range dipole - dipole interaction , that has been considered in several recent studies @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath13 is added so that the terms involving @xmath7 reduce to the kinetic energy expression in the continuum version of the many - body bosonic hamiltonian .",
    "conventionally , one defines the order parameter for a many boson system to be the thermodynamic expectation value of the boson field operator .",
    "invoking the concept of a broken gauge symmetry allows this expectation value to be nonzero below the bec transition temperature .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that this order parameter may be chosen to be the expectation value of the boson annihilation operator in the bosonic coherent state ( also known as the harmonic oscillator coherent state or glauber coherent state ) representation of the pure quantum state . in this description",
    ", it can be shown that quantum fluctuations are absent .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for the boson annihilation operator determined from ( [ bh ] ) , after a bosonic coherent state averaging yields the following gpe equation for the condensate order parameter @xmath14 in the continuum description .",
    "@xmath15    the gpe with @xmath16 provides a very useful characterization of the various properties of the bec of _ weakly repulsive _",

    "the condensate density @xmath17 satisfies a continuity equation , and the system shows no depletion .    the hcb limit ( @xmath18 ) of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ bh ] ) has emerged as a useful model to describe various characteristics of the bec of a _ strongly repulsive _ bose system .",
    "the constraint that two bosons can not occupy the same site can be incorporated in the formulation by using field operators that anticommute at the same site but commute at different sites , thus satisfying the same algebra as that of a spin-@xmath19 system . by identifying @xmath3 with the spin flip operator @xmath20 , along with @xmath21 , the system can be mapped to the following quantum xxz hamiltonian in a magnetic field :    @xmath22- \\sum_j({\\textstyle g } - \\mu)\\,\\ , \\hat{s}_j^z .",

    "this mapping to spins suggests that a natural choice for the condensate order parameter @xmath28 of the hcb system is the average of the spin flip operator in the spin coherent state representation @xcite , i.e. , @xmath29 in this representation , it can be shown that @xcite the condensate density , @xmath30 is related to total particle number density @xmath31 as , @xmath32    setting @xmath33 in the continuum description , the condensate order parameter @xmath34 and the particle density @xmath35 satisfy the following equations @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 , \\label{sgpe1}\\ ] ] with the identification @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "( [ eqnrs ] ) for the half - filled hgpe , and hence the condensate density @xmath108 for the gpe ( which is equal to to the particle density ) has the same functional form as the condensate density @xmath43 for the hgpe .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this mapping between the gpe and the hgpe is valid _ provided one considers only the condensate fraction _ of the hcb . since the half - filling case for particle density in hgpe corresponds to quarter - filling for the condensate density , the corresponding gpe density for this mapping to be applicable is @xmath109 .",
    "the mapping between the gpe and the hgpe discussed above provides the relationship that the width of the soliton for the condensate density in the gpe and the hgpe are given , respectively , by @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that the relationship between the gpe and the hgpe applies only to the condensate density profiles , as the solitons for the corresponding condensate wave functions in these two limiting cases will differ in their phase jumps .",
    "an interesting consequence of the mapping between the gpe and the hgpe discussed in the previous section is the emergence of a relationship between two distinct physical systems , the gpe soliton in a bec and a magnetic soliton that arises from the _ quantum _ easy - plane ferromagnet ( [ spinh ] ) .",
    "as we discuss below , this provides an interesting way to understand why there are in general two solitary waves in the bosonic density of the hcb system , and why in the special case of half - filling , the condensate part of the hcb has only one solitary wave and _ why it is dark_.    in magnetism , the study of strict solitons and solitary waves in various types of quasi - one - dimensional _ classical _ spin systems has been a very active field @xcite for over three decades .",
    "strict solitons arise as solutions of completely integrable systems which possess a lax pair . in view of the relatively few examples of systems exhibiting solitons and solitary waves ,",
    "any relationship that is found between different physical systems is fascinating , since it unveils the universal mathematical aspects underlying these nonlinear systems that describe completely different physical phenomena .",
    "one well known example is the gauge equivalence@xcite between the completely integrable landau - lifshitz equation for the dynamics of a spin vector in a _ classical _ isotropic heisenberg ferromagnetic chain and the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) , which is just the gpe equation ( eq .",

    "( i.e. , attractive interaction ) .",

    "( [ gpe ] ) ) with @xmath16 ( @xmath112 ) has been shown @xcite , using their respective lax pairs .",

    "typically , @xmath114 gets related to the x - derivatives of @xmath113 and @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "further , magnetic soliton solutions have been obtained in the continuum description of a _ classical _ ferromagnetic chain with a _ single - site anisotropy _ given by @xmath116 @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the relationship between the bose hubbard model and a _ quantum _ ferromagnetic heisenberg spin hamiltonian ( [ spinh ] ) with an _ exchange anisotropy _ and a magnetic field will be exploited to relate the bec soliton to the magnetic soliton .",
    "note that the anisotropy is of the easy - plane type since @xmath117 .    by writing the complex parameter @xmath118 appearing in the spin coherent representation @xcite as @xmath119 , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the coherent state average @xmath122 in the quantum spin-@xmath25 system can be calculated in terms of @xmath123 and @xmath40 . by identifying @xmath124",

    "in addition , the particle density @xmath35 , the chemical potential @xmath9 and the particle - hole imbalance variable @xmath127 in the bec system described by hgpe are related to the spin variables of the magnetic system as follows .      where @xmath129 is the magnetic field along the z - direction , as seen from the xxz hamiltonian ( [ spinh ] ) .",
    "of the above , the first equation is obtained by taking the expectation value of the corresponding hard - core boson operator to be spin coherent state average .",

    ".    on taking spin - coherent state averages of the quantum spins on the lattice and going to the continuum , the evolution equation for the condensate order parameter also describes the evolution of classical spins , where the asymptotic density controls the external transverse field in the spin system .",
    "the solutions discussed here correspond to the half - filled case where this external field is tuned to zero .    as a consequence of the relationship ( [ rho ] ) , a soliton solution of the total particle density @xmath130 corresponds to a nonlinear excitation of the @xmath131-component of the spin . on the other hand",
    ", the soliton of the condensate density describes a nonlinear excitation of the in - plane spin , and relates to the _ square of the in - plane magnetization _",
    ", due to the relationship ( [ rhos ] ) .",
    "+ as discussed in our earlier paper@xcite , the existence of the two solitons in hcb has its root in the fact that both particles and holes play equal roles in deciding the dynamics of the system .",
    "it is noteworthy that the xxz hamiltonian ( [ spinh ] ) provides an alternative means to understand the existence of the two solitons .",
    "the spin hamiltonian ( [ spinh ] ) contains terms with two competing effects , the easy plane anisotropy @xmath26 that tends to align spins in the @xmath132-plane and the the transverse field @xmath133 that favors a spin alignment along the @xmath131-axis .",
    "the ground state of the system consists of spins aligned on a cone that makes an angle @xmath134 with the @xmath131-axis where @xmath134 is determined by the background density of the atomic cloud given by @xmath135 .",
    "interestingly , in the half - filled case @xmath136 , the particle - hole imbalance @xmath137 is zero , and @xmath138 vanishes . in this case , the ground state consists of spins in the @xmath132-plane .",
    "therefore , the solitary wave excitation resulting in a localized change in the density makes the spins move out of the plane . in view of the fact that there is no clear preferred direction ,",
    "disturbances above and below the easy plane are equally preferred . in the corresponding particle density in hcb ,",
    "the dark and antidark solitons are therefore mirror images of each other , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ fsol ] ) .",
    "in contrast , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ rhos ] ) , the condensate density of hcb is related to the _ square of the in plane magnetization _ , ( which maps to the gpe density profile with @xmath139 ) resulting in a _ single _",
    "soliton both in the gpe and in the condensate fraction of the hcb .",
    "such a soliton has to be a dark soliton , since the out of plane component of the spin decreases the total magnetization of the system .    in summary , soliton characteristics in the bec of bosons in weakly and strongly interacting regimes",
    "are expected to be quite distinct . in cold atom laboratories where the interaction between atoms can be varied ,",
    "one expects significant changes in the dynamics as one tunes the scattering lengths of the bosonic atoms .",
    "therefore , our result illustrating the similarities between the solitons in these two different regimes in the special half - filled case is important .",
