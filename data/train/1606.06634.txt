    "+ when considering the dynamics without delay , the mechanism behind the emergence of periodicity can be understood in the following terms .",

    "the addition of delay does not change the scenario .",

    "it is worth to mention that the presence of a stable limit cycle as attractor for the dynamics is a pure infinite volume effect .",
