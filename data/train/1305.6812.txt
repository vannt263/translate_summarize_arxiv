    "possible evidence of a vortical flow in nuclei was suggested by the analysis of the structure of the isoscalar giant dipole resonance ( isgdr ) observed in @xmath7 scattering experiments @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and an exhaustive list of references ) .",
    "in fact , the prevailing conclusion from this analysis was that the high - energy peak of the isgdr is produced by compressional vibrations @xcite , whereas the low - energy bump should be attributed to vortical nuclear flow associated with a toroidal dipole mode @xcite .",
    "the toroidal moments emerge as second order terms of multipole expansions of electric currents in physical systems @xcite . in nuclei ,",
    "the toroidal mode ( tm ) was predicted within a hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was argued that a strong mixing between compressional and vortical vibrations in the isoscalar e1 states should be expected @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not yet completely settled how the vorticity relates to the toroidal and compressional modes .",
    "this depends on the way the vorticity is defined . in hydrodynamical ( hd ) models , where it is characterized by a non - vanishing curl of the velocity field @xcite , the vorticity is solely associated to the tm while the compressional mode ( cm ) is irrotational .",
    "an alternative definition , more linked to nuclear observables , was proposed by ravenhall and wambach ( rw ) @xcite .",
    "it adopts , as a measure of the vorticity , the multipole component @xmath8 of the transition density current @xmath9 .",
    "the motivation for this choice is that this component is not constrained by the continuity equation . with this measure of the vorticity ,",
    "the tm and cm describe mixed flows of both vortical and irrotational nature . in the recent study @xcite ,",
    "the vortical operator of rw type was derived and related in a simple manner to the cm and tm operators . then the vortical , toroidal and compression e1 strengths in @xmath10pb were compared and thoroughly scrutinized within a separable random - phase - approximation ( srpa ) @xcite using the sly6 skyrme force @xcite .",
    "later a similar study was performed for the isotopes @xmath11sn @xcite .    following the above srpa exploration",
    ", the tm falls into the energy region of so - called pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) @xcite supposed to be induced in neutron rich nuclei by a relative translational oscillation of the neutron skin against the residual n = z core .",
    "so an interplay of tm and pdr may be expected .",
    "as shown in our recent study @xcite within the full ( non - separable ) rpa @xcite , the pdr energy region indeed embraces various modes with a strong tm fraction .",
    "moreover , the vortical flow dominates in the nuclear interior while the irrotational motion ( relevant for e1 transitions in the long - wave approximation ) prevails at the nuclear surface .",
    "this point deserves a further investigation .",
    "in particular , a comparative analysis of experimental data from @xmath12 ( relevant for both tm and pdr in t=0 channel ) , @xmath13 observations ( e.g. in sn isotopes @xcite and n=82 isotones @xcite ) , and @xmath14 reactions is needed .    in this study ,",
    "we continue the exploration of the toroidal , compression and vortical ( rw ) e1 strengths in various mass regions using srpa . while the previous analysis concerned @xmath10pb @xcite and sn isotopes @xcite , the present study concentrates on sm isotopes , from spherical @xmath0sm to axially deformed @xmath1sm .",
    "thereby we look particularly at the influence of the nuclear deformation . like in @xcite",
    ", we use a representative set of skyrme forces ( sly6 @xcite , skt6 @xcite , svbas @xcite , skm * @xcite , and ski3 @xcite ) covering a wide range of the isoscalar effective mass , @xmath15 . the isoscalar ( t=0 ) , isovector ( t=1 ) , and pure proton ( elm ) channels of e1 excitations",
    "are considered .",
    "like in @xcite , the relative contributions to the strengths of the convection @xmath2 and magnetization @xmath3 nuclear currents are inspected . to demonstrate the ability of our approach and accuracy of different skyrme parametrizations ,",
    "the supplemented characteristics ( binding energies , photoabsorption cross sections , energy - weighted sum rules ) are considered .    the srpa method used in the present calculations",
    "has been already successfully applied to description of various kinds of nuclear excitations ( electric @xcite and magnetic @xcite giant resonances , e1 strength near the particle thresholds @xcite , and tm / cm / rw modes @xcite ) in both spherical and deformed nuclei and was shown as an efficient and reliable theoretical tool .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the theoretical background and calculation scheme are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , the supplemented characteristics are inspected and numerical results for tm , cm , and rw strengths are discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , the conclusions are done . in appendix",
    "a , the vortical , toroidal , and compression flows and their operators are discussed .",
    "the hd and rw conceptions of the vorticity on nuclear flow are outlined .",
    "appendix b sketches the derivation of the rw equations . in appendix c , a basic information about the srpa method is given .",
    "the main topic of this paper is the influence of nuclear deformation on the toroidal , compressional and vortical dipole strength functions .",
    "the corresponding transition operators are @xcite @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath17\\:y_{1\\:\\mu}(\\hat{r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are operator of nuclear current and nuclear density , respectively .",
    "symbols @xmath21 and @xmath22 stand for spherical harmonics and vector spherical harmonics , respectively , and @xmath23 is the ground state square radius .",
    "the derivation of these operators and their connection to the long - wavelength limit of the standard e1 operator @xmath24 can be found in the appendix a and ref .",
    "the toroidal , compressional , and vortical strength functions @xmath25 are calculated in the framework of the skyrme srpa approach @xcite , see appendix c for more detail . in the above expression , @xmath26 labels the tm , cm , and rw strengths determined by the operators ( [ 29 ] ) , ( [ 30 ] ) , and ( [ 31 ] ) , respectively . the indices @xmath27 stand for the rpa states with the energies @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the rpa ground state .",
    "further , @xmath30 is the lorentz weight with the averaging parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the averaging is needed for the convenience of comparison of the results with the experimental data and to simulate roughly the smoothing effects beyond the srpa ( escape widths and coupling to complex configurations ) . for the broad and poorly known tm , cm , and rw strengths",
    ", a constant averaging width @xmath31=1 mev is optimal .",
    "the strengths are analyzed in t=0 , t=1 , and electromagnetic ( @xmath32 ) channels characterized by the effective charges @xmath33 and gyromagnetic ratios @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are free neutron and proton gyromagnetic ratios , @xmath38 is the usual quenching factor @xcite .",
    "see details in appendix a.    the photoabsorption cross - section is fully determined by the @xmath39 transitions and thus reads @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath42 is the strength function calculated with the standard dipole operator @xmath43    for the photoabsorption cross - section , detailed experimental data are available @xcite .",
    "so it is worth to compute this observable more accurately .",
    "it should be taken into account that i ) the escape widths appear above the particle emission thresholds and grow with energy due to the widening of the emission phase space , ii ) the collisional widths , induced by the coupling with complex configurations , also increase with the excitation energy . to simulate these trends",
    ", one should use in ( [ 40 ] ) an energy - dependent averaging parameter @xmath44 .",
    "this can be done by implementing a double folding scheme @xcite .",
    "we calculate first the strength function ( [ 39 ] ) with the operator ( [ e1 ] ) by using a small but fixed value of @xmath31 .",
    "this gives the strength distribution @xmath45 very closed to one obtained in rpa but with an equidistant energy grid .",
    "this strength is then folded again by using an energy dependent @xmath44 : @xmath46 in the present study , we use a simple linear dependence @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy of the first emission threshold and @xmath49 mev is a minimal width .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 is chosen to reproduce the gdr strength distribution .    in order to test the sensitivity of the modes",
    ", we consider a selection of sufficiently different skyrme parametrizations ( skt6 @xcite , svbas @xcite , skm * @xcite , sly6 @xcite , and ski3 @xcite ) covering a wide range of isoscalar effective masses : @xmath51=1 , 0.9 , 0.79 , 0.69 , and 0.58 , respectively .",
    "all the parametrizations provide a good description of basic ground properties of nuclei .",
    "the configuration space in the calculations covers all particle - hole ( two - quasiparticle ) states with an excitation energy up to @xmath52 mev .",
    "such a big basis allows to exhaust in the srpa calculations about 100% of the isovector thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) @xcite for the gdr and isoscalar harakeh s ewsr for the isgdr @xcite ( see also an extensive discussion at the end of the next subsection and appendix c ) . besides that",
    ", the large basis is crucial to lower the energy position of the spurious e1(t=0 ) peak towards the correct zero energy . in the present study",
    ", it lies in spherical @xmath0sm at @xmath53 mev , depending on the skyrme parametrization .",
    "this is not so good as in some full rpa calculations for @xmath10pb , which use a larger configuration space and manage to yield the spurious peak below @xmath54 0.6 mev , see e.g. sly5 @xcite and sly6 @xcite results .",
    "however , the present value is sufficient for our aims since the t=0 strengths of interest are situated at @xmath55 5 mev and further extension of the configuration space does not significantly affect them . to be on the safe side ,",
    "the tm , cm , and rw strength functions are given below only in the range @xmath55 5 mev .",
    "the calculations exploit a 2d representation in cylindrical coordinates using a mesh size of 0.3 fm and a calculation box of 21 fm . for open - shell isotopes",
    ", we use zero - range pairing forces .",
    "the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations are implemented at the bcs level @xcite . for closed shell nuclei , this reduces automatically to a hartree - fock ( hf ) treatment .",

    "in addition to spherical @xmath0sm and deformed @xmath1sm , the transitional isotopes @xmath57sm are also shown to illustrate the trends with development of the deformation .",
    "the treatment of these soft isotopes within rpa is known to be insufficient and has to be amended by the coupling with complex configurations @xcite . nevertheless , we find useful to present these rpa results to outline the trends .    in figure 1 ,",
    "the binding energies of sm isotopes calculated within the hf / hfb approach are depicted in dependence on the dimensionless parameter of the quadrupole deformation @xmath56 . for all skyrme forces used here , we see the pronounced main minima at @xmath56=0 in the spherical @xmath0sm and at @xmath56=0.33 - 0.34 in the prolate deformed @xmath1sm . in the latter case ,",
    "the internal quadrupole moment is @xmath58=6.4 - 6.6 b. both computed @xmath56 and @xmath58 are in a good agreement with the experimental values @xmath59=0.34 and @xmath60=6.6 b @xcite . in the transitional @xmath57sm ,",
    "the calculations produce two shallow minima with roughly the same depth , corresponding to prolate and oblate shapes , respectively . despite all the skyrme parametrizations are fitted to experimental binding energies of selected doubly magic or semi - magic nuclei , in our calculations only the sly6 , sv - bas , and ski3 forces reproduce the measured binding energy @xcite in the semi - magic @xmath0sm .",
    "the two older parametrizations skm@xmath61 and skt6 were tuned to doubly - magic nuclei only and do not perform so well for the rather soft @xmath0sm .    in figure 2",
    ", the calculated photoabsorption cross section is inspected .",
    "we get a good agreement with experiment @xcite for most skyrme forces in the spherical @xmath0sm and the well deformed @xmath1sm .",
    "the deformation splitting of the gdr in @xmath1sm is also reproduced . for the transitional isotopes , the agreement is acceptable as well . in all the nuclei ,",
    "the main deviation arises at the high - energy wing of the gdr .",
    "this is probably an effect of neglecting the complex configurations .",
    "additional useful insight may be obtained from the analysis of the sum rules . as was mentioned above , the trk sum rule for the photoabsorption cross section",
    "is exhausted in our calculations by about 100@xmath62 , see details in appendix c. for the purposes of the present study , it is crucial to check the sum rule for the isgdr @xcite @xmath63 , \\ ] ] obtained for the transition operator ( [ 30 ] ) and @xmath64 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab1 ] and they prove that this sum rule is also nicely fulfilled . thus exhausting both isovector trk and and isoscalar isgdr e1 sum rules",

    "the calculations give two broad cm bumps , a smaller one at low - energy and a large one at high - energy , which is in accordance to previous theoretical and experimental studies , see review @xcite . in @xmath1sm ,",
    "the strength is larger and more uniform than in @xmath0sm , as expected for a heavier and more deformed nucleus .",
    "three non - trivial effects are visible in both t=0 and t=1 channels .",
    "first , in @xmath1sm we see a substantial growth of the cm strength in the region @xmath68 mev where the pdr is supposed to appear .",
    "the comparison with the constrained case @xmath56=0 ( no deformation ) for the force sly6 indicates that this effect should be mainly ascribed to increasing the number of neutrons ( from magic 82 to 92 ) .",
    "indeed , unlike @xmath0sm , in @xmath1sm particular low - energy s.p .",
    "transitions @xmath69 $ ] become active , which may lead to the growth of the strength .",
    "however , following fig .",
    "4 , where the deformation splitting of @xmath4=0 and @xmath4=1 cm(t=0 ) components for skt6 and sly6 forces is demonstrated , the deformation effect is also important .",
    "just due to deformation , the low - energy and high - energy parts of the region @xmath68 mev are dominated by @xmath4=0 and @xmath4=1 branches , respectively .",
    "moreover , the comparison of t=0 and t=1 strengths allows to state that the pdr region may be also separated into two isospin sectors , a low - energy t=0 and a high - energy t=1 ones .",
    "this conjecture finds support in recent experimental analysis @xcite , which have split the low - lying e1 spectra into an upper and lower energy sectors .",
    "the upper sector is excited solely in @xmath13 and , therefore , has t=1 nature .",
    "the lower sector , instead , is composed of levels excited in both @xmath13 and ( @xmath70 and thus may be related to t=0 excitations .",
    "second , fig .",
    "3 shows that in @xmath1sm a substantial bump appears at 20 - 30 mev .",
    "this is particularly pronounced in t=0 .",
    "the comparison to the case @xmath56=0 indicates that the bump is caused by the deformation .",
    "4a ) shows that this is just the @xmath4=0 branch of the high - energy cm .",
    "we also see in fig .",
    "4a ) a huge deformation splitting ( @xmath54 10 mev ) of the cm(t=0 ) strength computed with sly6 force ( similar results are obtained for other skyrme forces ) .",
    "thus deformation gives for the high - energy cm indeed dramatic effect .",
    "third , fig .",
    "3 shows that the cm strength in general and low - energy and high - energy cm bumps in particular are noticeably upshifted with decreasing @xmath51 .",
    "this takes place for both isotopes @xmath0sm and @xmath1sm and in both channels , t=0 and t=1 .",
    "the effect is straightforwardly explained by well known spread of s.p .",
    "spectra below the fermi level with decreasing @xmath51 , see examples in @xcite .            in figure 5 ,",
    "the rpa cm strength functions are depicted .",
    "the residual interaction significantly downshifts ( upshifts ) the strength in t=0 ( t=1 ) channels .",
    "nevertheless all three effects discussed above for hf / hfb case remain the same .",
    "the @xmath71 experiment @xcite gives for the isgdr in @xmath0sm two bumps with the energies and widths e=14.2 mev , @xmath72=4.8 mev and e=25.0 mev , @xmath72=19.9 mev .",
    "the narrow low - energy and broad high - energy bumps of the isgdr are commonly treated as tm @xcite and cm @xcite , respectively .",
    "alternatively , both bumps may be treated as merely cm branches with the strong cm / tm coupling at a low energy @xcite . following fig .",
    "5 , our calculations for @xmath0sm roughly reproduce the experimental data @xcite for the forces skt6 , svbas , skm * , and sly6 . for ski3 with a low effective mass @xmath51=0.58 ,",
    "the agreement for the high - energy cm bump is not so good .",
    "it seems that skyrme forces with a large @xmath51 are more preferable for description of cm .",
    "note that , following fig .",
    "4 , the residual interaction considerably decreases the deformation splitting . as compared to the hfb case , it is reduced for the high - energy cm(t=0 ) bump from @xmath54 10 mev ( hfb ) to @xmath54 5 mev ( rpa ) .",
    "nevertheless , the deformation splitting remains very large .",
    "such strong splitting is known only for the isovector gdr .    in fig .",
    "6 , the rpa tm strength in @xmath66sm is depicted in t=0 and t=1 channels . unlike the cm ,",
    "the tm is concentrated at low energy while the high - energy strength is rather weak .",
    "following our analysis , this is because of the instructive ( destructive ) summation of @xmath73=10 and 12 terms in the tm operator ( [ 29 ] ) in the low - energy ( high - energy ) regions .",
    "for the cm operator ( [ 26 ] ) ( which may be decomposed in similar manner @xcite ) , we have the opposite result .    the tm(t=0 ) strength in fig .",
    "6 demonstrates the same three effects discussed above for cm : i ) pumping the strength to the pdr region due to neutron excess / deformation impact , ii ) appearance of an appreciable @xmath4 = 0 bump due to the deformation splitting of the high - energy strength , iii ) general upshift of the strength with @xmath51 . the manifestation of the effects for tm is weaker than for cm and",
    "noticeably depends on the force : the effects are significant for skt6 , svbas , skm * , ski3 but small for sly6 . in the t=1 channel ,",
    "the effects are much weaker , perhaps because the main player , the high - energy tm , is almost absent .    in fig .",
    "7 , a similar behavior is observed for the vortical rw strength generated by the operator ( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "the main difference from tm is that low - energy and high - energy rw bumps in t=0 channel are of a comparable strength .",
    "anyway both tm and rw are strong at 5 - 15 mev where the maximal nuclear vorticity is expected @xcite",
    ".    figs . 8 compares in @xmath0sm the cm , tm , and rw strengths in t=0 and t=1 channels with the strengths in the electromagnetic ( elm ) channel relevant for @xmath14 reaction , where only the proton part of the transition operators is active , see ( [ 46 ] ) . fig .",
    "9 does the same for @xmath1sm .",
    "it is seen that the strengths in the elm channel are very similar to t=1 ones .",
    "further figs . 8 and 9 demonstrate the contributions of the convection @xmath74 and magnetization @xmath75 nuclear currents ( [ 11 ] ) to the strength . in accordance to the previous calculations for @xmath10pb @xcite",
    ", the @xmath74 dominates at t=0 and @xmath75 at t=1 ( and elm ) .",
    "finally we remark that for a detailed study it is desirable to go beyond rpa and take into account more complex configurations .",
    "the low - lying e1 modes , in fact , may couple to two - phonon states describing collective - core excitations coupled to collective surface vibrations , like an octupole - quadrupole excitation .",
    "several rpa extensions are already available . among them , there are the qrpa plus phonon - coupling model @xcite and the separable rpa plus two - phonon approach @xcite with skyrme forces , and the relativistic time - blocking approximation ( rtba ) @xcite embracing the anharmonicity by coupling the rpa phonons to particle - hole + phonon states .",
    "alternatively , one may use the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite with woods - saxon separable potential and the equation - of - motion phonon method ( empm ) with realistic interactions @xcite .",
    "all these rpa extensions have been adopted with fair success to describe the low - energy e1 response in nuclei like @xmath10pb ( see e.g. @xcite ) and confirmed an important role played by the multi - phonon states in e1 low - lying spectra .",
    "however , before performing more detailed investigations with including multiphonon states , a first exploration with mere rpa exploration is desirable and this is just what we have presented here .",
    "the e1 compression , toroidal , and vortical @xcite strengths in even sm isotopes ( from spherical @xmath0sm to deformed @xmath1sm ) were investigated within the self - consistent separable random - phase approximation ( srpa ) approach @xcite with skyrme forces . a representative set of different skyrme parametrizations ( skt6 @xcite , svbas @xcite , skm * @xcite , sly6 @xcite , and ski3 @xcite ) was used .",
    "three reaction channels were inspected : isoscalar ( t=0 ) , isovector ( t=1 ) and electromagnetic ( with the proton part of the transition operator ) .",
    "particular attention was paid to effects of the quadrupole deformation .    as a first step ,",
    "the accuracy of the scheme was checked with respect to binding energies , photoabsorption cross sections , and e1 energy - weighted sum rules ewsr ( isovector for the gdr and isoscalar for the isgdr ) .",
    "it was shown that the configuration space used in our calculations is large enough to guarantee a good reproduction of the sum rules .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the e1 compressional , toroidal , and vortical strength functions for the chosen variety of the skyrme forces .",
    "the strengths in the electromagnetic channel ( relevant for the reaction of inelastic electron scattering ) are very similar to t=1 strength . in accordance to our previous explorations for @xmath10pb @xcite and sn isotopes @xcite",
    ", we find that the convection nuclear current @xmath2 plays a dominate role in all t=0 strengths while the magnetization nuclear current @xmath3 is crucial in t=1 and electromagnetic channels .",
    "all strength distributions are upshifted to higher energies with decreasing effective mass @xmath5 which may be related to the corresponding spreading the single - particle spectra @xcite .",
    "following our analysis , skyrme forces with a high affective masses , @xmath76 0.81 , are more suitable for the description of the experimental data for the isgdr @xcite , whose branches are commonly related to the toroidal and compression modes ( tm and cm ) .",
    "the most interesting results are obtained for the deformation impact on the strengths .",
    "there is a dramatic general redistribution of the compressional strength with deformation when passing from spherical @xmath0sm to deformed @xmath1sm . in the quasiparticle ( hfb )",
    "approximation , the deformation splitting of the high - energy cm amounts to as much as 10 mev .",
    "the residual interaction activated in rpa somewhat decreases the effect and reduces the splitting to 5 mev .",
    "however even such a splitting is huge . as a result",
    ", the high - energy cm demonstrates a clear separation into @xmath4=0 and @xmath4=1 branches . the @xmath4=0 branch is considerably downshifted and looks more like an individual resonance .",
    "this effect is strong for cm and weaker for other strengths .",
    "besides , it is stronger in the t=0 channel than in the t=1 channel",
    ". it would be interesting to check our findings in @xmath71 experiment for @xmath1sm .",
    "besides that , the move from @xmath0sm to @xmath1sm causes a considerable redistribution of the strength in the low - energy ( pdr ) region .",
    "this may be attributed to both increasing the number of neutrons and deformation .",
    "following our calculations , the pdr region covers both cm and tm strengths in both t=0 and t=1 channels , see also discussion @xcite .",
    "moreover , in accordance to recent experimental analysis @xcite , the pdr region may be separated into t=0 and t=1 sectors . however",
    ", a proper exploration of this detail requires a more involved theoretical framework taking into account the coupling with complex configurations .",
