    "jacobi forms play a central role in the theory of automorphic forms ( e.g. , via the fourier jacobi expansion of orthogonal modular forms ) , in quantum field theory ( where they appear as characters of infinite dimensional lie algebras ) and in algebraic geometry ( where they provide an indispensable tool for the construction of functions with prescribed behavior of their divisors ) . a philosophical reason for this might be that any given space of scalar - valued or vector - valued elliptic modular forms of integral or half - integral weight can be naturally embedded into a space of jacobi forms of integral weight and lattice index on the full modular group  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their centrality and importance , they have the striking property that there are various methods to compute their fourier expansions or even to describe them by explicit formulas . the main techniques to compute jacobi forms are ( 1 ) theta blocks @xcite , ( 2 ) pullback of jacobi forms of lattice index of singular or critical weight , where the latter are essentially invariants of weil representations of  @xmath0 @xcite , ( 3 ) the taylor expansion of a jacobi form around @xmath1 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and ( 4 ) modular symbols  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we describe an implementation based on the latter",
    ".    why do we focus on the modular symbol method ?",
    "theta blocks work nicely for small weights and produce appealing explicit formulas but miss more and more jacobi forms the larger the weight becomes .",
    "similarly , it is not yet clear in what generality the most recent method of pulling back singular and critical weight jacobi forms of lattice index works .",
    "the taylor expansion method always works and is easy to implement but becomes computationally harder as the index and , accordingly , the dimension of the spaces of jacobi forms increase .",
    "in contrast to this , the modular symbol method allows one to compute directly a desired jacobi eigenform without having to generate first a whole space of jacobi forms and then cut it down in a second step to the eigenspace one is looking for .",
    "more precisely , we start with a modular symbol representing an elliptic eigen - newform we are interested in .",
    "the articles referenced above that are related to the modular symbol method propose closed formulas for the jacobi newform associated to this elliptic modular form .",
    "this allows , for example , for an automatic generation of tunnell like formulas for ( the squares of ) the central values of the l - function attached to the twist of a given elliptic curve over the rationals .    whereas a ready - to - compute description of jacobi forms in terms of modular symbols is given in  @xcite for weight @xmath2 ( based on the results in  @xcite ) ,",
    "the formulas in  @xcite , which cover weights @xmath3 , need some reformulation along the lines of  @xcite . since the necessary steps for this are not completely obvious we found it worthwhile to deduce and describe these steps in detail in this note .",
    "the resulting formulas are summarized in  theorem  [ thm : formula ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by discussing a couple of examples . after showing the kind of data",
    "the algorithm can produce , we give some background to jacobi forms and then proceed to state and prove the mentioned formula we implemented .",
    "we then highlight some details of our implementation and we conclude with an appendix of various tables as proof of concept of our formulas and implementations.the implementation of the formula we derive is available at  @xcite .",
    "we start with some examples that we computed via an implementation of .",

    "we remark that , for holomorphic jacobi forms like @xmath4 and @xmath14 in section  [ sec : egs ] , we have @xmath39 and so an alternative is to use fourier coefficients @xmath40 indexed by pairs of integers @xmath7 , @xmath10 with @xmath41 and obtain a fourier expansion of the form @xmath42 as illustrated by those two examples .",
    "however , in what follows it will be more convenient to index the coefficients as in , which works for both holomorphic as well as skew - holomorphic jacobi forms .    a form in @xmath43 is cuspidal if @xmath44 for every @xmath10 . for @xmath2 and @xmath45",
