    "the southern sky was surveyed at 2.7  by the parkes radio telescope between 1968 and 1979 ( see bolton , savage & wright 1979 , and references therein ) , resulting in a catalogue of more than 10,000 radio sources . over this period , an extensive programme of optical identifications was undertaken . in its early stages , this programme was frustrated by lack of a southern radio calibrator grid , poor radio positions ( the original parkes positions were only accurate to 1015  arcsec ) and a lack of optical sky survey plates .",
    "modern methods , using accurate ( better than 1 arcsec ) radio positions and complete catalogues of digitised optical sky survey data , with the radio and optical reference frames tied to an accuracy of better than 100 milliarcsec ( johnston et al .",
    "1995 ) now allow unambiguous optical identification of most of the radio sources , supplemented by ccd imaging for the remainder . in this paper",
    "we present new identifications of a sample of parkes flat - spectrum radio sources using these techniques .",
    "the parkes catalogue contains both steep- and flat - spectrum sources .",
    "radio samples are biased towards core - dominated quasars if the flat - spectrum sources are selected and towards lobe - dominated quasars and galaxies for steep - spectrum sources .",
    "since the scientific questions of primary interest to us are related to core - dominated quasars , we concentrate on flat - spectrum sources in this study .",
    "other workers have compiled a number of complete samples of radio sources .",
    "each has been selected on different criteria , leading to the inclusion of different objects .",
    "low frequency samples contain more radio galaxies than quasars , high frequency ( i.e. flat - spectrum ) samples reverse that bias , and lower flux limits increase the mean redshift of the objects in the sample .",
    "four notable samples are the 3cr sample ( spinrad et al .  1985 , laing , riley & longair 1983 ) , the 2 jansky sample ( wall & peacock 1985 ) , the 1 jansky sample ( khr et al .  1981 ; stickel , meisenheimer & khr 1994 ) , and the parkes selected regions ( dunlop et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the 3cr sample comprises 173 sources selected with @xmath5  over an area of 4.23 .",
    "the high flux limit biases this sample towards lower redshift objects ( 18% have @xmath6 ) , and the use of a low frequency biases the sample towards steep - spectrum radio galaxies . the 2 jansky sample , which was selected at 2.7  over an area of 9.81 , contains 233 objects which are mainly steep - spectrum , again biasing the sample towards low - redshift radio galaxies .",
    "the 1 jansky sample was selected at 5 , also over 9.81  of sky and comprises 518 sources .",
    "55% are flat - spectrum sources , and of those @xmath7 are quasars or bl lacs ; many are parkes sources . finally , the parkes selected regions ( a total of 0.075 ) contain 178 sources with @xmath8 , most of which are steep - spectrum extended sources identified as galaxies .",
    "only 23% are flat - spectrum sources , but these objects have a distribution of properties similar to our sample .",
    "our primary interest in this paper is the compilation of a large unbiased sample of radio - selected quasars .",
    "note that we use the standard definitions of `` quasar '' for radio - loud sources and quasi - stellar - object ( qso ) for optically - selected sources .",
    "there were several motivations for defining the sample .",
    "first , we were interested in using quasars for gravitational lensing studies .",
    "a proper determination of lensing statistics requires the identification of complete quasar samples , as well as an understanding of any selection effects which might bias selection of gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "secondly , the recent completion of the large bright qso survey ( lbqs : hewett , foltz & chaffee 1995 ) has meant that there is a well - defined sample of optically - selected qsos , allowing the determination of global spectroscopic properties .",
    "the completion of a comparable sample of radio - selected quasars will allow a detailed phenomenological comparison of the optical spectra of these two classes of object , perhaps allowing the determination of differences in underlying physical conditions .",
    "finally , quasars are one of the most effective probes of the universe to high redshift , providing a measure of evolution as well as the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "of course the complete identification of a sample of radio sources can also provide some surprises , if unexpected objects , such as very high redshift quasars , are found .",
    "the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample we define here contains 323 sources selected in an area of 3.90  and is similar to the earlier compilation by savage et al .",
    "we have made significant progress in the optical identification of the sources which were previously termed `` empty fields '' , particularly by using near infrared  band ( 2.02.3 microns ) imaging to detect the optically faint sources .",
    "the extremely red optical to near infrared colours of these sources imply that most are heavily reddened , viewed through dust either in the line - of - sight to the quasar or within the immediate quasar environment ( see webster et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this paper",
    "we present optical identifications for 321 sources ( 99% of the sample ) , and redshifts for 277 sources ( 86% ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the selection criteria for the radio sources are described in section  [ sec_sample ] . in section  [ sec_positions ]",
    "we explain how the accurate radio positions were obtained , and present radio images of the resolved sources in the sample .",
    "section  [ sec_optical ] describes the mapping of the accurate radio positions onto the optical catalogues .",
    "we present a full discussion of the accuracy of this procedure , locate the likely optical counterparts , classify these images as either stellar or non - stellar and provide the optical magnitudes . where there is no optical survey image at the location of the radio source , we use r - band ccd frames and  near infrared images to determine the source identification and morphology . in section  [ sec_spec ]",
    "we present spectroscopic classifications and redshifts of these sources ; for those sources which do not have a published spectrum , we also include the spectra .",
    "all these results are summarised in a master catalogue of the sample in section  [ sec_cat ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec_corr ] presents a summary of the most important features of our sample .",
    "an electronic version of our catalogue is available from the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg in section viii ( `` radio data '' ) of the catalogue archive .",
    "our basic selection criteria are very similar to those used by savage et al .",
    "we started with the machine - readable version of the parkes catalogue ( pkscat90 , wright & otrupcek 1990 ) and applied the following criteria :    1 .",
    "2.7  ( @xmath9 ) and 5.0  ( @xmath10 ) fluxes defined 2 .   @xmath11   3 .",
    "spectral index @xmath0 , where @xmath1 4 .",
    "galactic latitude @xmath2 5 .",
    "@xmath12    in our search of pkscat90 , three objects did not have a 5.0  flux defined but satisfied all the other criteria .",
    "one of these was later included from our search of the discovery papers , but the other objects were not measured at 5.0  in the discovery papers , presumably because they are very bright radio sources associated with bright optical galaxies : pks  0131@xmath13367 ( 5.6 , 15mag ) and pks  0320@xmath13374 ( 98 , 10mag ) and were too extended to measure properly .",
    "this search resulted in an initial sample of 325 objects .",
    "we then carefully checked all the radio fluxes in the original discovery papers of the radio survey , as listed in table  [ radio_surveys ] .",
    "many objects have more recent ( but unreferenced ) flux measurements listed in pkscat90 , but we replaced these with the original fluxes in order to quantify the time difference between the 2.7 and 5.0  measurements and thus estimate the effects of variability . after the original fluxes were adopted , 15 sources no longer satisfied the flux and spectral criteria and so were excluded .",
    "we also found 17 sources whose original fluxes in the discovery papers satisfied the selection criteria so these were added to the sample .    in two regions ( samples a and f",
    "; see table  [ radio_surveys ] ) our search of pkscat90 produced several sources not listed in the original papers .",
    "these two regions of the original survey were not complete because the flux limit was not well - defined ; subsequent unpublished observations detected additional sources satisfying our selection criteria that were included in pkscat90 .",
    "we retained these additional objects ( 12 in each region ) , but flagged them with a minus sign in front of the reference code ( rf ) in the final catalogue ( table  [ tab_master ] ) .",
    "finally we removed four planetary nebulae from the sample on the basis that we are interested in extragalactic sources .",
    "this gave a final sample of 323 sources which are listed in table  [ tab_master ] in section  [ sec_cat ] .",
    "our new sample is complete in 6 of the 8 sub - regions listed in table  [ radio_surveys ] but in two of the regions ( a and f ) the original surveys are incomplete and we have added additional sources from pkscat90 .",
    "the distributions of the fluxes and spectral indices are given in figs .",

    "no completeness analysis was made for regions a and f so extra objects from pkscat90 not in the original papers were included ( 12 in each case ) and the flux limits are only indicative .",
    "the 5  fluxes for region b were published separately by wall ( 1972 ) .",
    "= _ wide    = _ wide    = 16.5 cm      flat - spectrum radio sources are well - known to be variable , which introduces two biases in our sample . first , our sample was selected to have a 2.7  flux above 0.5  _ at the observation epoch_. some of the sample may have been in a particularly bright state ; their average fluxes may be below our limit .",
    "likewise some flat - spectrum sources with average fluxes above 0.5  may have been excluded from the sample because they were in a particularly faint state when the sample was defined .",
    "secondly , the 5  observations of the sample sources were not obtained simultaneously with the 2.7  observations ( see table  [ radio_surveys ] ) .",
    "the 5  observations were usually taken after the 2.7  observations ; the time interval being more than 6 months in @xmath28% of cases ; six months is a typical variability timescale for compact radio sources ( fiedler et al .",
    "if a source varied between the two observations , its spectral index could be in error , and the object might be wrongly included in , or excluded from , the flat - spectrum sample .",
    "stannard & bentley ( 1977 ) investigated the variability of 50 parkes flat - spectrum radio sources , substantially overlapping our sample .",
    "they compared 2.7  fluxes taken two years apart , and found that @xmath29% of sources had varied by 15% or more .",
    "the number of sources included in the flux limited sample because they were brighter than average at the time of observation will exceed the number of sources missed because they were fainter than average .",
    "this is because there are more sources with mean fluxes just below 0.5  that there are with fluxes just above 0.5 , due to the steepness of the number / flux relation . using stannard & bentley s numbers",
    ", we estimate that @xmath30 3040 of our sources have mean fluxes below 0.5 , and that we missed @xmath30 2030 sources with mean fluxes above 0.5 .    allowing for the time delay between the 2.7  and 5  measurements",
    ", we can also estimate that @xmath31 flat - spectrum sources with @xmath32 will have been mistakenly classified as steep - spectrum and excluded from our sample , while another @xmath31 with @xmath33 will have been wrongly included .",
    "this calculation ignores the dependence of variability on spectral index .",
    "fiedler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) showed that most bright compact radio sources with relatively steep - spectra ( @xmath34 ) vary by only @xmath35% on timescales of two years .",
    "this implies that we will only misclassify @xmath35 objects with @xmath36 as being steep - spectrum .",
    "however , they also find that a small fraction of very flat - spectrum sources ( @xmath37 ) can vary by 50% or more on timescales of two years .",
    "applying their numbers to our sample , we estimate that @xmath38 sources with @xmath37 may have varied by enough to have been misclassified as steep - spectrum .",
    "these numbers may be an overestimate ; fiedler et al .  only considered compact sources , whereas several of our objects , particularly those with steeper spectra , are extended and may be less variable .",
    "we plan to address this uncertainty by remeasuring the sample making simultaneous flux measurements at both frequencies .    in summary",
    ", variability imposes an uncertainty on our 0.5completeness limit at 2.7 : some 3040 ( @xmath3011% ) sources in our sample have mean fluxes below the limit , and we missed some 2030 ( @xmath308% ) sources with mean fluxes above the limit .",
    "this bias is inherent to any single - epoch flux - limited sample .",
    "on the other hand we find that @xmath30510 objects in our sample actually have @xmath39 ( steep - spectrum ) and have been wrongly included because they varied between the epochs of the 2.7  and 5.0  measurements , but that another @xmath30510 flat - spectrum objects were missed for the same reason .",
    "we had to improve on the poor ( 1020 arcsec ) accuracy of the original parkes radio positions before being able to make optical identifications of the radio sources by positional coincidence .",
    "to this end we have obtained more accurate radio positions for all sources in the sample using published data , the vla calibrator manual ( as compiled by perley & taylor , 1996 ) and our own very large array ( vla ) and australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations . the sources of these positions and the associated errors are listed in table  [ tab_rradio ] .",

    "the observations were made at 4.86  with the vla in its `` cnb '' configuration to yield nearly circular synthesised beams with approximately 6 arcsec fwhm resolution .",
    "each programme source was covered with a single `` snapshot '' scan of about 3 minutes duration , and each group of snapshots was preceded and followed by scans on a phase calibrator whose rms absolute position uncertainty is not more than 0.1 arcsec in each coordinate .",

    "the ( u , v ) data recorded from both circular polarizations in two 50   bands centered on 4.835 and 4.885  were edited , calibrated , and mapped with aips .",
    "the images were cleaned , and the clean components were used to self - calibrate the antenna phases , yielding images with dynamic ranges typically @xmath41 . nearly every programme source contains a dominant compact component that should coincide in position with any possible optical identification .",
    "the positions of these compact components were determined by gaussian fitting on the images .",
    "the formal fitting residuals are @xmath42 arcsec because the synthesised beam is small and the signal - to - noise ratios are high . thus the radio position uncertainties are dominated by atmospheric phase drifts and gradients not removed by the calibration .",
    "they range from about 0.2 arcsec at dec @xmath43 to about 0.5 arcsec at dec @xmath44 .",
    "several remaining sources in the sample were observed with the atca during 1993 march and november using all 6 antennas with a maximum baseline of 6  km .",
    "observations were made at 4.80 and 8.64  in `` cuts '' mode with orthogonal linear polarisations at a bandwidth of 128 .",
    "the synthesised beam at 4.80  has a constant east - west resolution of 2 arcsec fwhm and a north - south resolution varying from 3 arcsec ( at dec @xmath44 ) to 8 arcsec ( dec @xmath45 ) .",
    "`` cuts '' mode involves observing each object for a period of one minute on at least 6 occasions spread evenly over 12 hours . in this way , it is possible to obtain imaging data on approximately 40 sources within a 12 hour observation .",
    "secondary calibrators with accurate , milliarcsec positions close to the programme sources were observed at least once every 2 hours .",
    "the flux density scale was determined from observations of the primary calibrator at the atca , pks  1934@xmath13638 .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated within aips and images made using the caltech difmap software ( shepherd , pearson & taylor , 1995 ) .",
    "the final self - calibrated images have typical dynamic ranges in excess of 400:1 for strong and relatively compact sources , decreasing to approximately 100:1 for objects with weak or extended emission .",
    "source positions were calculated by fitting a gaussian to the peak in the brightness distribution of a cleaned ( but not self - calibrated ) 8.64  image .",
    "the uncertainty in source positions measured from these atca images comprises a component due to thermal noise , which scales inversely with s / n ( @xmath30beamwidth/(s / n ) ) and a component due to systematic effects arising from the phase - referencing . the latter term dominates for strong sources and scales linearly with angular distance between the source and the phase - reference used to calibrate its position .",
    "the error is approximately 0.1 arcsec for an angular separation of 5  ( reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the new radio positions are presented in table  [ tab_master ] . as shown in table  [ tab_rradio ]",
    "these are all accurate to 0.6 arcsec or better for unresolved sources .",
    "any radio sources we know to be resolved are noted in the comments column of table  [ tab_master ] and we present radio images of these sources in fig .",

    "we made an independent check of the radio centroid position for this source by measuring it on the 4.85  survey images made with the nrao 140-foot telescope ( condon , broderick & seielstad , 1991 ) . a gaussian fit gave a position of 03:49:31.5 @xmath1327:53:41 ( b1950 ) , consistent with the original position ( and coincident with an optical galaxy ) but not with the stronger vla source at 03:49:41.17 @xmath1327:52:07.0 ( b1950 ) .",

    "the northern limit of the source is close to a bright galaxy .",

    "a1 ) with no central component the centroid of the image was not used to define the position ; the north - east component was adopted instead .",
    "this was chosen because of the very good positional correspondence with a quasar at redshift z=1.45 and also the fact that no optical counterpart for the south - west component was detected in the hubble space telescope snapshot survey ( maoz et al.1993 ) .",

    "a factor contributing to our successful identifications is the greatly improved agreement between the radio and optical reference frames in the south ( e.g. johnston et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "our major source of optical data is the cosmos / ukst southern sky catalogue .",
    "this lists image parameters derived from automated measurements of the eso / serc southern sky survey plates , taken on iiia - j emulsion with the gg395 filter to give the photographic blue passband  ( 39505400 ) .",
    "the catalogue is described further by yentis et al .",
    "there are systematic errors in the astrometry of the cosmos catalogue : we made a first - order correction as described by drinkwater , barnes & ellison ( 1995 ) by using the ppm star catalogue ( rser , bastian & kuzmin 1994 ) to calculate a mean shift in the positions for each schmidt field used .    for sources north of + 3 degrees we used data from the automated plate measuring facility ( apm ; see irwin , maddox & mcmahon 1994 ) at cambridge based on blue ( unfiltered 103a - o emulsion ; 35504650 ) and red ( red plexiglass 2444 filter plus 103a - e emulsion ; 62506750 ) plates from the first palomar observatory sky survey ( poss  i ) .",
    "the sky catalogues were used to generate finding charts for all the sources which we present in appendix  [ sec_charts ] .",
    "these charts are a good approximation to the photographic data , but we stress that there can be problems with image merging in crowded fields : close objects ( e.g. two stars ) can be misclassified as a `` merged '' object or galaxy .",
    "the `` field '' code at the bottom of each chart indicates the ukst field number ( or the plate number for poss  i ) with a prefix describing the type of plate .",
    "the prefix `` j '' indicates ukst  plates measured by cosmos . for apm data `` j '' indicates ukst  plates , `` o '' blue poss  i plates and `` e '' red poss  i plates .",

    "this section describes the methods we used to find optical counterparts for the 32 sources not matched to images listed in the optical catalogues .",

    "however a counterpart was clearly visible on the plate , but it was too faint to be included in the automated catalogue or it had been merged with a neighbouring object .",
    "we note that six of these unmatched sources were assigned optical identifications in pkscat90 ; our new accurate positions show that these need to be revised . in three cases ( pks  1349@xmath13145 , pks  1450@xmath13338 , pks",
    "2127@xmath13096 ) there is a faint matching object but it is merged with a brighter image and in the other cases there is no optical counterpart at all at the correct position ( pks  0005@xmath13262 , pks  1601@xmath13222 , pks  2056@xmath13369 ) .    to identify the sources unmatched on the sky surveys we turned to longer wavelengths , using optical -band , i - band , and infrared -band ( 2.02.3 microns ) imaging on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) and the australian national university ( anu ) 2.3 m telescope .",
    "these data were analysed using the iraf analysis software .",
    "the observations resulted in identifications of 30 of the remaining sources including the merged objects , one of which was separated using a -band image .",
    "these sources are listed in table  [ tab_master ] in the same way as the sources identified from the digitised survey data , except that no  magnitude is given and the position offsets are estimated from the ccd frames .",
    "the source of the identifications is indicated in the comment column as `` ( r ) '' or `` ( k ) '' .",
    "we will present a full analysis of the - and -band data in later papers .",
    "the 2 sources we did not identify include pks  1213@xmath13172 which lies too close to a bright star to be identified in our data but stickel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) report having identified it with a `` @xmath57 mag resolved galaxy '' .",
    "the remaining source , pks  0320@xmath46015 was not detected in a  image ( approximate limit of = 18 ) but we anticipate identifying it when a deeper exposure is available .",
    "we note that pks  2149 + 056 which we detected in our  image was previously detected and identified as a quasar with a measured redshift by stickel & khr ( 1993 ) .      for the majority of the matched sources for which spectroscopic redshifts have been measured we are confident of having made the correct optical identification . for the remaining sources for which we have not yet obtained redshifts ,",
    "the identifications must be made on positional coincidence alone .",
    "a very detailed analysis of the statistics of source identifications was made by sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) in the context of matching iras sources with poor positions to the optical sky survey data .",
    "our problem is much simpler because both our source ( radio ) and survey ( optical ) positions are accurate .",
    "furthermore , we do not wish to include the image magnitudes in the analysis because we do not know the true distribution of optical magnitudes  a large fraction of the sources without spectroscopic confirmation are at the faint limit of the magnitude distribution .",
    "we made an estimate of the number of `` identifications '' in our sample that might just be coincidences by calculating the mean surface density of images in the sky survey catalogues at the plate limit and finding how many of these would lie within the match criteria .",
    "for the 46 fields without spectroscopic confirmation we would expect 1 random matches within a radius of 3 arcsec .",
    "in fact most objects lie within 2 arcsec : at this separation we would only get 0.4 random matches .",
    "it is therefore possible that one of the identifications we claim without spectroscopic confirmation is wrong : ideally only the sources with spectroscopic identifications should be used for analysis purposes .",
    "earlier versions of the flat - spectrum sample have been the subject of extensive campaigns of spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "some two thirds of the sample were identified in the summary made by savage et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and we have drawn on this work for the current sample .",
    "we carried out a very detailed literature review to find published redshifts for as much of the sample as possible .",
    "we based our search on the quasar catalogue compiled by hewitt & burbidge ( 1993 ) with additional material from the vron - cetty & vron ( 1993 ) quasar catalogue , the center for astrophysics redshift catalog ( version of may 28 , 1994 ; see huchra et al .",
    "1992 ) , the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned , helou et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the lyon - meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) .",
    "there are occasional errors in some of these large compilations , so for every redshift found in the catalogues we checked the reference cited and only accepted values for which we found a measured redshift in the original reference .",
    "we present these redshifts in table  [ tab_master ] along with a code that specifies the source of the measurement .",
    "for some objects the source reference indicated that the redshift was uncertain ( e.g. due to a single line or a lower limit derived from the redshift of an absorption system ) ; in these cases the reference code is prefaced by a `` @xmath13 '' sign .",
    "for some additional objects we found no published original reference ( some were given by private communications ) : these are assigned a reference code of zero and we have not listed the redshift in our table .",
    "after our critical search of the literature we accepted published redshifts for 206 sources in our sample of 323 sources .",
    "at the same time we searched for published spectra of any sources in our sample ; references to these are also given in table  [ tab_master ] .",
    "again , we only include those spectra we have checked in the original references .      as a result of the identifications presented in this paper we started a campaign of new spectroscopic identifications .",
    "this has resulted in 114 new spectra and 90 new redshift measurements which we present here .",

    "the sources with measured redshifts span the redshift range 0.053.78 with a median redshift of 1.07 ( see fig .  [ fig_reds ] ) .",
    "the redshift histogram is smooth , and broadly similar to that of optical surveys such as the large bright qso survey ( lbqs ; see hewett et al.1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution of our sample is compared to that of the lbqs in fig .",
    "[ fig_reds ] .",
    "the lack of lbqs quasars in the lowest redshift bin is due to the absolute magnitude and redshift cut - off of that survey .",
    "the 2-sample kolmogorov - smirnov test ( comparing sources with redshift @xmath62 in both samples : 235 parkes and 1018 lbqs ) gives results consistent with the two samples having the same redshift distribution at the 35% probability level .",
    "this makes the two samples ideal for comparing the properties of radio- and optically - selected quasars .    the distribution of optical  magnitudes of our sources ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_mags ] and [ fig_mags2 ] ) shows that despite the fact that our sample was not selected on the basis of optical magnitude , the sources occupy a restricted range of magnitudes .",
    "the majority have @xmath63 .",
    "the well - defined mode in the distribution of   magnitudes is not an artifact of the plate limit of @xmath64 ; the number of sources with @xmath65 is clearly below that with @xmath66 .",
    "however a small fraction of sources are clearly very faint in .",
    "in common with browne & wright ( 1985 ) we find that the modal   magnitude of our flat - spectrum sample is a function of radio flux ; the most radio - bright sources have slightly brighter typical   magnitudes ( fig .  [ fig_mags2 ] ) .",
    "this is also shown in fig .",

    "= _ wide    there is some suggestion from our data that the radio - to - optical ratio may be a physically meaningful parameter , as originally suggested by schmidt ( 1970 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] we plot radio - to - optical ratios @xmath67 as a function of radio luminosity , for different classes of source . a clear correlation can be seen , with the lowest radio - luminosity sources having low values of @xmath67 .",
    "if , however , we exclude galaxies , the correlation disappears , and no sources remain with @xmath68 .",
    "the sources without redshifts have radio - to - optical ratios above those of the detected sources , which may reflect dust obscuration of the   emission ( webster et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "= _ wide    = _ wide    this correlation can be modelled by assuming a strict proportionality between the  and 2.7  luminosities of our quasars , but adding the light of a host galaxy .",
    "if we assume that all host galaxies have absolute   magnitudes of @xmath69 , the quasar light will dominate over the host galaxy light for 2.7  luminosities @xmath70 ( for assumed cosmology see the caption to fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] ) . above this luminosity",
    "there will be no correlation between @xmath67 and the radio flux , as observed , and below this luminosity @xmath67 will be proportional to the radio flux , which is consistent with the observed correlation .",
    "the radio spectral indices do not correlate with redshift , apparent   magnitude , radio flux or radio luminosity  but the range of spectral index in the sample is of course limited .",
    "the compilation of this paper would not have been possible without the efforts of many people who have worked on the parkes radio samples over the past 20 years or more .",
