    "in the present paper we would like to know whether the content of metals in the formation regions of stars can introduce some signature in the ( @xmath1 ) diagram [ @xmath2 fractional age the stars can spent in the main sequence ( ms ) evolutionary phase ] . in fact , it was shown by stepie ( 2002 ) that magnetic fields not exceeding 400 g can spin up early type stars in the pms life , while stronger magnetic fields spin them down .",
    "however , since the mechanism acts through magnetic mass - accretion and magnetic - disc locking , the efficacy of the magnetic interaction can differ according to the metallic content in the star and its gaseous environment .",
    "it has been shown that be stars rotate at @xmath3 ( frmat et al .",
    "2005 ) . this rotational rate can be attained in the ms evolutionary phase only if stars have high rotational rates early in the zams .",
    "it is expected then that the presence of magnetic fields and its effectiveness at establishing high initial stellar surface rotations can be different according to the metallic content of the medium where they are formed : _",
    "age vs. mass _ distributions may then be somewhat different .",
    "our aim is to study be stars situated towards the _ galactic - center _ and in the _ anti - center _ directions and see whether some information can be drawn form the _ age vs. mass _ distributions .",
    "high resolution and s / n spectroscopic observations were carried out on 118 be stars in the southern hemisphere with feros spectrograph at eso / la silla ( chile ) and with the coud spectrograph at the 1.60 m telescope of mct / lna ( brazil ) .",
    "eso spectra were taken with a spectral coverage of 3560 - 9200    and typical s / n @xmath4 .",
    "lna spectra were obtained with a wi098 ccd from 3939     to 5060     with a reciprocal dispersion of 0.24   / pixel .",
    "the stellar fundamental parameters were obtained in two steps .",
    "first , we derive the ( @xmath5 ) parameters with classical non - lte model atmospheres that we call @xmath6 . in the second step ,",
    "we correct the @xmath6 parameters for rotational effects due to stellar deformation and the concomitant gravitational darkening effect .",
    "we obtain thus the @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 fundamental parameters , i.e. those which depict homologous stars without rotation ( frmat et al .",
    "we correct them once more to obtain the fundamental parameters @xmath11 over the entire deformed stellar surface , which are finally used to interpolate masses @xmath12 and ages @xmath13 of the studied stars in evolutionary tracks calculated for rotating objects ( meynet & maeder 2000 , zorec et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a first estimate of the effective temperature and gravity is attempted through the fit of equivalent widths of many spectral lines , including balmer lines and line intensity ratios such as heii / hei and si iii / siii . once the first guess of ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) is established we perform a detailed fit of the observed lines with non - lte spectra synthesized with tlusty ( hubeny 1988 ) and synspec ( hubeny , hummer , & lanz 1994 ) codes",
    ". ratios of two neighboring ionization states elude sensitivities to abnormal element abundances carried by the fast rotation .",
    "however , the occurrence of heii lines in the visible is constrained to stars hotter than b2 ( @xmath16 22000 k ) . as most b and",
    "be stars in our sample show only hei lines , we studied many combinations of hei line ratios and used those with the less dependence on the helium abundance .",
    "fixing @xmath15 values , we calculated synthetic hei and heii line profiles for different temperatures from 15000 to 30000 k and helium number abundances he / h ratios from 0.001 to 0.3 . the analysis performed with neutral helium lines (",
    "hei@xmath17 4009 , 4026 , 4121 , 4144 , 4388 , 4438 , 4471 and 4922 ) show that only a few combinations of them ( he i4922/hei4026 , hei4438/hei4144 , he i4438/hei4026 , hei4438/hei4009 , he i4144/hei4121 ) are less sensitive to the helium content .",
    "the @xmath6 projected rotational velocity @xmath18 was derived from the first zero of the fourier transform of the hei@xmath194471  line profile .",
    "the @xmath6 @xmath18 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 were then corrected for rotational effects ( frmat et al .",
    "2005 , zorec et al .",
    "the evolutionary tracks used to calculate masses and ages are for rotating stars ( meynet & maeder 2000 , zorec et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the distribution of fractional ages ( @xmath2 age / time spent in the ms ) against the stellar mass of all studied be stars is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1]a . in this figure",
    "we see that _ all studied stars , but one , lay below the tams_. although most of the studied stars lay in the second half of the ms strip , a non negligible number of them is still in the first half of the ms evolutionary phase . quite similarly to what was found in zorec et al .",
    "( 2005 ) _ a lack of stars with masses @xmath20 below @xmath21 0.5 is noticeable_. in our sample , stars with masses @xmath22 approach the tams",
    ". this may be due to their fast evolution and perhaps to some lack in our stellar sample of massive be stars with ages @xmath23 0.5 .",
    "this lack can also be produced by a loss of angular due to their high mass - loss rates .",
    "they can become low rotators rapidly and thus be impeded to display the be phenomenon any more .    in order to separate the stars in two sets carrying possible information on differences in initial matallicity content , we separated them into  galactic - center \" and  galactic anti - center `` groups .",
    "[ f1]b shows that there is no noticeable difference in the _ ",
    "age vs. mass \" _ distributions thus obtained .",
    "the most striking differences are : a ) the number of be stars in the ' ' galactic - center \" group outnumbers the  anti - center \" one ; b ) there are younger be stars in the anti - center direction . finding a ) may agree with the fact that low metallicity favors fast rotation ( maeder et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , the distinction between both groups could be more reliable if we could see differences in the number fractions n(be)/n(b+be ) .",
