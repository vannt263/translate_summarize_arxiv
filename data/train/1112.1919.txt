    "the timescale for halo stars to exchange their energy and angular momentum is long compared to the age of the milky way galaxy .",
    "thus , the stellar halo of the milky way provides a unique laboratory for studying hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "theoretical simulations show that the remnant debris of hierarchical galaxy formation should be visible as star streams in the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "indeed , observers have discovered the tidal debris of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite wrapping around the milky way @xcite and other stellar overdensities throughout the stellar halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the vast majority of these detections come from star counts without radial velocity measurements .",
    "we describe a powerful technique for identifying tidal star streams that exploits the additional information provided by a complete radial velocity survey .",
    "with large stellar radial velocity surveys such as rave @xcite and segue @xcite now available , approaches including radial velocities enable better constraints on structure in the halo .",
    "to identify statistically significant tidal structures , we examine the surface number distribution and the radial velocity distribution of stars in great circles . both the surface density and the radial velocity distributions probe the origin of structure in the halo .",
    "a radial velocity test for structure applies independently of the underlying spatial distribution .",
    "our technique opens up the possibility of finding tidal star streams based on structure in velocity space .",
    "combining our spatial and radial velocity statistical tests provides a more powerful joint test for identifying star streams .",

    "most of these methods include an assessment of the statistical significance of the structures they detect .",
    "the method we develop contains elements of previous approaches refined for application to radial velocity samples that are complete over some substantial portion of the sky .",
    "our approach has three steps : ( 1 ) we analyze great circle counts based on a nearly uniform , dense grid of sampling poles , ( 2 ) we compare the great circle radial velocity distribution with the radial velocity distribution for the entire survey , and ( 3 ) we combine the great circle counts and velocity distribution comparison into a single statistic .",
    "we estimate the significance level , or probability of false positives , among the structures we detect .",
    "the orbits of tidal debris from disrupted satellite galaxies in the milky way halo persist for several gyr .",

    "the latitude and longitude of the pole on the unit sphere then determine the location of its corresponding great circle , as illustrated in figure [ fig : graphic ] .",

    "we then record observed counts for all segments of great circles corresponding to these poles that lie within the sample boundaries .    to account for multiple statistical tests on the same set of data and to avoid overstating the statistical significance of the findings ,",
    "we modify the great circle count technique of @xcite . using the bonferroni correction @xcite , we adjust the probability of each individual test , @xmath20 in equation  ( [ pgceqn ] ) , to account for multiple tests by multiplying the probability by the total number of tests of the data .",
    "the bonferroni correction protects against false positives but at the expense of more false negatives .",
    "the bonferroni correction assumes that the tests are independent and represents a lower bound when they are not .",
    "thus , our estimate of the overall probability of false positives is conservative .",
    "in fact , we expect that none of the highest confidence streams we detect in the hvs survey sample are false positives ( see  [ sec : greatcirclecounts ] ) .",
    "radial velocities of stars are a potentially important probe for the presence of star streams .",
    "the velocity distribution for halo stars is nearly gaussian with average line - of - sight velocity @xmath21  km  s@xmath22 and velocity dispersion @xmath23  km  s@xmath22 in the galactocentric rest frame @xcite .",

    "relative to the large dispersion of the halo , this small velocity dispersion should enable detection of streams in velocity space .",
    "we search for evidence of streams by comparing the distribution of radial velocities for the stars in a great circle with the _ observed _ distribution of radial velocities for the entire sample .",
    "if the distribution of radial velocities on the sky is randomly drawn from this underlying distribution , the radial velocities of stars lying in an arbitrary great circle should follow the same distribution . rather than assuming a gaussian radial velocity distribution of background halo stars _ a priori _",
    ", we use the observed radial velocity distribution for the sample . in this approach",
    ", the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test provides a nonparametric estimate of the probability , @xmath25 , that the radial velocity distribution for stars within a great circle is randomly drawn from the same distribution as the hvs survey .",

    "we combine the great circle count and radial velocity probabilities to form a joint test under the assumption that spatial position and radial velocity are independent .",
    "the probability of observing a group of stars and their radial velocities within a great circle segment of width @xmath3 is then the product of the individual probabilities for each of these events , @xmath26 .",
    "although position and radial velocity may not be truly independent , the combined probability gives a measure of the joint departure of the spatial and velocity distributions from those for a set of points randomly distributed on the sphere and randomly drawn from the observed radial velocity distribution .",
    "there are several important observational and theoretical limitations to our ability to detect tidal streams .",
    "observational limitations include the limited sky coverage of a sample and the limited depth and density of a sample .",
    "theoretical limitations include departure of the orbit of the stream from a great circle and multiple orbits or wraps of the streams .",
    "@xcite review many of the issues involved in detecting tidal debris in the galactic halo .",
    "existing radial velocity surveys sample only a fraction of the sky .",
    "consequently , we can only access great circle segments with arc lengths @xmath27",
    ". the observed magnitude limit of a radial velocity survey defines the volume of the halo and the part of the orbit we sample .",
    "we are potentially less sensitive to the apocenter passage than to the pericenter passage of the orbit .",
    "more stars are stripped from the progenitor of a star stream near pericenter , probably enhancing our ability to detect streams and possibly leading us to overestimate the density of the stream .",
    "our sensitivity depends on the width of the great circle that we choose .",
    "the overall density of the sample sets a lower limit on the width of great circles we can profitably explore .",
    "as we increase the width of the great circles we use to sample the distribution , dilution of potential streams by background stars increases .",
    "this problem is particularly serious for the intrinsically narrowest streams .    for computational convenience",
    "we approximate orbits as great circles .",
    "however , the sun s offset of approximately 8 kpc from the galactic center means that orbits do not appear exactly as great circles on the celestial sphere , an effect that diminishes with the size of the orbit and the proximity of the sun to the plane of the orbit .",
    "furthermore , the orbits depart from great circles for a nonspherical galactic potential .",
    "a nonspherical galactic potential causes precession of the orbit of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "stars stripped during different passes of the progenitor may then appear in the same observed great circle . in our technique ,",
    "one indication of this phenomenon is the appearance of multiple peaks in the observed radial velocity distribution for the great circle approximating the orbits .",
    "multiple wraps may also increase the great circle count .",
    "in addition , intersection with other streams or structures may produce multiple peaks in the radial velocity distribution as well as an increase in the great circle count .",
    "we demonstrate our technique by applying it to the spectroscopic sample of distant halo stars from the hvs survey of @xcite .",

    "the estimated number of stars within the sagittarius stream is the excess number of stars above random , @xmath113 = @xmath114 . _ a posteriori _",
    ", we verify that the locations of the poles for this collection of great circles change little as a function of @xmath36 and that the excess number of stars as a function of @xmath36 is independent of any small change in the @xmath115 of the most significant pole for an adopted @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : sgrcounts ] shows our estimate for the number of survey stars in the sagittarius stream , @xmath113 , as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the derived @xmath113 rises from @xmath116 70 for @xmath117 to @xmath116 150 for @xmath36 = 14  and then levels off . adopting a typical @xmath118 for @xmath36 = 1420",

    "shows that sagittarius contributes about 10% to 17% of the stars in the hvs survey .",
    "because this approach uses the full hvs survey , it yields a better estimate of the fraction of hvs survey stars within the sagittarius stream .",
    ".,width=312 ]      to conclude this section , we compare the surface density of stars identified in our observations of the sagittarius stream with the predictions of the @xcite model . for each iteration in a monte carlo simulation , we construct a sample of model stars with the same number of stars observed in the hvs survey .",
    "this model sample consists of ( i ) stars drawn randomly from the @xcite model and ( ii ) stars distributed randomly and isotropically in the hvs survey area . based on our result in  [ sec : bluestardensity ]",
    ", we select 17% of this sample from the @xcite model .",

    ", we can express the ratio of the observed surface density to that predicted from the monte carlo simulations as @xmath121 .",
    "here , @xmath111 is the number of stars in the most significant great circle observed in the hvs survey sample , @xmath122 is the median value of the number of stars in the most significant great circle from the monte carlo simulations , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are , respectively , the probabilities that a star placed randomly in the sample region falls within the observed or simulated great circle .",
    "this analysis shows that the @xcite model matches our observed surface density for stars in the sagittarius stream . for simulations with @xmath36 = 5 , we derive @xmath125 = 1.03 , with a 90% confidence interval of 0.821.43 .",
    "simulations with other @xmath36 s yield similar results .",
    "we construct a statistical technique to detect star streams in the galactic halo based on both the surface number density and the radial velocity distribution within great circles .",
    "the addition of radial velocities to the analysis increases our ability to identify star streams and to show that some overdensities in number counts are superpositions of several distinct structures in velocity space .",
    "the technique is straightforward yet powerful , can be generalized to diverse sets of data , and quantifies the statistical significance of tidal star streams .",
    "detection is possible even when a structure contributes only a few percent of the stars in a sample .",
    "we apply the method to the hvs survey and detect the sagittarius stream at high significance .",
    "comparison with theoretical models confirms that blue stragglers and bhb stars are members of the sagittarius stream .",
    "great circle counts and comparisons with theoretical models suggest that the sagittarius stream comprises 10% to 17% of the halo stars in the hvs sample .",
    "the ratio of blue stragglers to blue horizontal branch stars varies along the length of the stream , with roughly equal numbers of these two stellar types at ra = 050  and a 2:1 mix of blue stragglers to blue horizontal branch stars at ra = 130180 .",
    "our conclusions support previous indications of variations in stellar population related to the original structure of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "this technique is easily applied to other large radial velocity surveys including rave @xcite and segue @xcite .",
    "identifying tidal star streams in these radial velocity surveys will ultimately improve constraints on the milky way s formation history , dark matter halo mass distribution , and the distributions of stellar populations within the progenitors .",
