    "the recent progress in the search for low frequency solar oscillations  possibly g - modes  achieved in the golf ( soho ) experiment  @xcite and future experimental proposals  @xcite open new possibilities for the detailed studies of the solar radiative zone ( rz ) as well as the solar core which can not be done by solving inverse helioseismic problem for the high frequency p - modes .",
    "the frequencies found in the experiment  @xcite turn out to be slightly shifted @xmath1 compared to the predictions of the solar seismic model ( ssem )  @xcite obtained in the absence of magnetic field and solar rotation .",
    "the influence of the rz magnetic field on the g - modes frequency shifts was studied in ref .",

    "the correct separation of the cusp ( alfven ) resonances in 1-d model ( see sec .",
    "[ marcttdms ] below ) , which enables one to simplify the problem in question , is the significant advantage in comparison with 3-d model that allows us to compute rotation and magnetic corrections .",
    "such corrections are calculated in a 3-d model with help of the perturbation theory , without referring to the presence of mhd resonances , using eigenfunctions of horizontal and vertical displacements @xmath2 computed in ssem not accounting for a magnetic field or a stellar rotation . on the contrary ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of the 1-d problem , the vertical velocities @xmath3 , depend on both the magnetic field and the stellar rotation .",
    "these functions are the exact analytical solutions to the considered problem .    in the present work",
    "we continue to study the modifications of _ analytical _ mhd spectra for internal helioseismological waves in the 1-d model beyond the jwkb approximation taking into account both the magnetic field and the _ rotation _ of the sun .",
    "note that in the 3-d mhd the solar rotation can be taken into account in analytical spectra only in the frame of the jwkb approximation of short waves , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it should be also mentioned that in the 1-d model we loose the effect of the stellar rotation with respect to an observer because of the simplification of the topology . in the 3-d model",
    "this effect is characterized by the azimuthal frequency splitting @xmath5 . however , even in the case of the rigid body rotation , the influence of the coriolis force in the reference frame , rotating together with a star , results in the additional frequency splitting which remains in the 1-d problem as well .",
    "the aim of this work is to evaluate such an effect in a magneto - active plasma beyond the scope of the perturbation theory , applied in the 3-d model , or jwkb approximation .",

    "the faraday equation takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the compressibility of gas .",
    "finally the full nonlinear ideal mhd equation system is completed by the equation of the entropy conservation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total gas pressure ; @xmath21 is the heat capacity ratio ( @xmath22 for hydrogen plasma ) .    note , that in the equilibrium condition , @xmath23 the contribution of the centrifugal force ( last term ) is negligible in the sun ( @xmath24 ) .      in order to find spectra of seismic waves accounting for the magnetic field and rotation in rz a number of assumptions is required .",
    "we shall specify these as they are used , in order to keep clear which results rely on which assumptions , but we also list them all here for ease of reference .    1 .",
    "we consider ideal mhd neglecting both the heat conductivity and viscosity contributions to energy losses , as well as the ohmic dissipation .",
    "we linearize the mhd equations about an equilibrium background configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ a background configuration which is time independent and given by the condition  ( [ equilibrium ] ) .",
    "3 .   we assume the fluctuations to be adiabatic , with the contributions of fluctuations to the heat source vanishing : @xmath25 .",
