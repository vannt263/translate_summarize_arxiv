    "observations show that some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) occur at cosmological distances , and some of the bursts are related to the supernova explosions . if the radiation of a cosmological grb is isotropic , its energy release is estimated to be @xmath5 erg at the hundreds of kev range .",
    "massive supernovae emit comparable amounts of energy , mainly in the form of neutrinos .",
    "thus a question about the origin of grbs energy supply arises .",
    "connection between the grb phenomenon and that of a supernova seems to be supported by several facts .",
    "first , the paper by  @xcite reports the temporal and spatial concurrence of the `` compact '' supernova sn 1998 bw ( @xmath6 erg , type snic ) with grb 980425 , identified with a nearby galaxy which has @xmath7 . secondly",
    ", `` hills '' are observed in the light curves of some optical transients several days after the grb ; they can be interpreted as a contribution from the supernova burst simultaneous with the grb .",
    "thirdly , narrow x - ray lines of ions characteristic of supernova shells are detected in the spectrum of the afterglow  @xcite , with the velocity of the line - emitting material reaching @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , the `` energy crisis '' arises if we attempt to relate an isotropic grb to a supernova .",
    "one way to avoid this crisis is to suggest that grbs are associated with strongly collimated relativistic ejections radiating within @xmath1-range .",
    "this makes it possible to decrease by many orders the luminosity from cosmological grbs corresponding to the observed fluxes .",
    "@xcite proposed this connection between grbs and strongly anisotropic supernova bursts .",
    "summarizing , we see that current understanding of the nature of grbs requires a combination of two conditions : a supernova explosion ( possibly of special type ) and the formation of a narrow ( opening angle less than a degree ) beam of relativistic particles radiating within x- to @xmath1-range .",
    "@xcite proposed a model where a beam of relativistic particles is formed by the interaction of a fast shock wave generated during a supernova explosion with a magnetized star - companion ( a neutron star or a white dwarf ) of the supernova precursor .",
    "the flow of the shock matter around the magnetosphere of the star - companion forms an almost parallel magnetospheric tail .",
    "magnetic field in the tail becomes super strong ( about @xmath9 g ) due to the cumulative effect .",
    "virtually any star - companion interacting with a supernova shock will produce such strong magnetic field , due to amplification during the explosive compression of conducting medium - the mechanism proposed by  @xcite to produce very strong magnetic fields .",
    "for the typical shock parameters , the density @xmath10 is of order @xmath11 , and the velocity @xmath12 is about @xmath13 , the value of the amplified magnetic field is @xmath14 gauss . for a usual star like the sun ( which has magnetic field of the order of @xmath15 ) , the compression will be about @xmath16 times and the transversal size of the tail will be equal to @xmath17 .",
    "hence , virtually any explosion of a supernova which had a star - companion , will result in a highly magnetized elongated plasma formation in the shadow of the star - companion .",
    "the magnetic field changes its direction from one edge of the tail to the other , which leads to the magnetic reconnection , magnetic energy release , and acceleration of charged particles .",
    "similar processes take place in the magnetospheric tail of the earth formed by the flow of the solar wind . in a strong magnetic field",
    "these relativistically accelerated particles produce synchrotron radiation concentrated in a narrow cone @xmath18 .",
    "the frequency of supernova explosions has the order of @xmath19 per a galaxy , which gives @xmath20 radiation bursts per year , directed towards the earth ( the universe has @xmath21 galaxies ) .",
    "all this may provide an insight into the nature of grbs .",
    "in this paper we provide an accurate quantitative theory of the outlined phenomena , namely the evolution of the current sheet , the acceleration of charged particles , and the formation of the radiation spectrum .",
    "magnetic field of a star is almost dipolar at the large distances from the center of the star .",
    "its direction changes from one side of the sheet to the other ( with respect to the axis of the tail ) .",
    "interaction of a dense plasma flow with this dipole magnetic field produces a long current sheet . a similar magnetospheric tail is formed by solar wind in the dipolar magnetic field of the earth .",
    "such situation may also arise in a close binary system of stars , consisting of a magnetized star and a massive supernova precursor .",
    "a shock wave from the exploding massive star interacts with the magnetized star and forms a current sheet , resulting in a grb .",
    "such model of grbs was proposed in the papers of  @xcite .",
    "yet another example of the current sheet formation comes from a binary system of neutron stars , one of which is a radio pulsar .",
    "relativistic wind flow of the radio pulsar around the other star forms a magnetic tail .",
    "discovery of a close binary system of neutron stars containing two radio pulsars psr j0737 - 3039 a , b was reported in the paper of  @xcite .",
    "observations of this system show that the wind flow of the more powerful pulsar a around the magnetosphere of the radio pulsar b takes place inside the light cylinder of the pulsar b. thus , a long and almost parallel tail of magnetic field is formed in the magnetosphere of b.    to study the phenomena taking place in the magnetosphere of a magnetized star , we assume the sheet to be flat and infinitely long . therefore , all characteristics depend only on one coordinate @xmath22 , which is perpendicular to the current sheet .",
    "our approximation is one - dimensional , which makes possible the solution of non - stationary problems .",
    "the geometric structure of this problem is presented in figure 1 .",
    "non - uniform magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath23 axis and the tail , the @xmath24 axis is perpendicular to the @xmath23-@xmath22 plane .",
    "magnetic field depends linearly on the @xmath22 coordinate @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant determined by electric currents flowing in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "a particle with charge @xmath27 and mass @xmath28 in such non - uniform magnetic field is subject to the gradient drift  @xcite @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the velocity and momentum components of the particle perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "equation  ( [ grad - dr ] ) is not applicable near the plane @xmath32 .",
    "the larmor radius of the particle is greater than the inverse gradient of the field there , so the drift approximation is not valid when @xmath33 .",
    "electric current @xmath34 produced by the drift motion of charged particles with density @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 and is independent of their charge .",
    "brackets @xmath37 mean averaging over the distribution function of the particles .",
    "in addition to the drift current resulting from the drift of the particles in the non - uniform magnetic field , there also exists a magnetization current @xmath38 due to non - uniform distribution of the magnetic moments of the particles , @xmath39 .",
    "the sum of the drift current and the magnetization current depends only on the gradient of the transversal energy density of particles @xmath40 the total current @xmath41 is formed by the electron and ion flows . assuming plasma to be quasineutral and consisting of electrons and positively charged ions with mean charge @xmath42",
    ", we see that the electric current is @xmath43.\\ ] ] on the other hand , we have @xmath44 finally , @xmath45 equation  ( [ equilib ] ) is virtually identical to the equilibrium condition of an inhomogeneous plasma in a non - uniform magnetic field , when the equilibrium is supported by external pressure @xmath46 .",
    "now we add an extra assumption that the current sheet is compressed by some external force acting along the @xmath22 axis , and consider the evolution of such sheet .",
    "we may assume that the evolution is fast enough and it can be described by ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "mhd equations for the one - dimensional case ( all parameters depend only on the @xmath22 coordinate ) are @xmath47 during the one - dimensional compression ( or expansion ) of the current sheet magnetic field remains one - dimensional , @xmath48 in addition to the @xmath24 component of the velocity @xmath49 , the @xmath22 component becomes time - dependent as well @xmath50 the plasma density is @xmath51 , its pressure is @xmath52 .",
    "we use the equation of state @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the adiabatic exponent . from the first and the fourth equations of system  ( [ maineq ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath55 which leads to the following condition @xmath56 which means that the magnetic field is `` frozen '' into the plasma .",
    "hence , we have @xmath57 , so let @xmath58 .",
    "now , the third and the fourth equations of system  ( [ maineq ] ) describe the evolution of the velocity @xmath59 and plasma density @xmath60 @xmath61 the change of variables @xmath62 reduces the system of non - linear equations  ( [ twoeq ] ) to the following linear system @xmath63 to simplify the notation we drop the index of @xmath64 . eliminating the derivatives of @xmath22 we obtain one equation for @xmath65 @xmath66 solution of this equation",
    "can not be expressed in terms of known special functions for the arbitrary values of @xmath67 .",
    "however , we can obtain a quasiclassical approximation to the general solution after applying laplace transform to the variable @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath69 , the quasiclassical solution to  ( [ oneeq ] ) is @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the fast magnetic sound speed .",
    "the function @xmath73 appearing in the solution depends on the initial conditions .",
    "we may assume that the velocity @xmath68 is zero when @xmath74 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath75 as well .",
    "it is convenient to write the initial condition for the density @xmath76 at @xmath74 in the following way @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the density at @xmath79 . from the continuity equation of system  ( [ twoeq ] ) it follows that @xmath80 . from the first equation of the same system ( the equation of motion )",
    "we see that @xmath81 .",
    "after we change variables to @xmath82 , @xmath83 , our initial conditions become @xmath84 in the obtained solution , @xmath85 satisfies the equation @xmath86 , and @xmath87 satisfies the equation @xmath88 . for @xmath89 the value @xmath87 can not be determined , because at the limiting value @xmath90 the density @xmath87 vanishes and can not be negative later . since @xmath91 , the condition @xmath92 is virtually identical to @xmath93 , and quasiclassical solution  ( [ quasit ] ) is not valid .    substituting  ( [ quasit ] ) into  ( [ lineq ] ) gives the following approximation for @xmath94 @xmath95 + \\int_{\\rho_0}^\\rho f(\\rho_1 ) d\\rho_1.\\ ] ] the integrals appearing in expressions  ( [ quasit],[quasiz ] ) have their simplest form when @xmath96 , which is close to the adiabatic exponent for an ideal gas @xmath97 .",
    "in this case the solution is @xmath98 here we have chosen the function @xmath73 to be the power function @xmath99 where @xmath100 is an arbitrary value and @xmath101 .",
    "solutions @xmath102 and @xmath94  ( [ quasi2 ] ) are always single - valued functions of ( @xmath103 ) , but the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 may not be . the quantity @xmath105 can be found by reversing the second equation of system  ( [ quasi2 ] ) .",
    "this can be uniquely done until the moment when the shock occurs and the jacobian of the transformation of the unknown variables vanishes @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 the jacobian @xmath109 always vanishes at a value @xmath110 .",
    "when the shock occurs , the derivatives @xmath111 and @xmath112 become infinite which leads to the singularity in the electromagnetic field . the question whether there is a shock for almost arbitrary initial perturbations is very important , so we would like to obtain an exact solution of the mhd equations , and it is only possible for @xmath96 .",
    "this solution can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions @xmath113 the hypergeometric function @xmath114 appearing in these equations has a branch point at @xmath115 , which means that solution  ( [ exact - tz ] ) can not be continued into the region @xmath116 .",
    "note that quasiclassical solution  ( [ quasi2 ] ) for @xmath96 corresponds to the first two terms in the expansion of exact solution  ( [ exact - tz ] ) into powers of @xmath27 .",
    "both in the exact solution and in the quasiclassical one , the singularity occurs for @xmath117 when the jacobian @xmath109 vanishes ( the shock point ) .",
    "however , in the exact solution the shock occurs only for negative values of @xmath100 , namely for @xmath118 .",
    "these values of @xmath100 correspond to the more natural initial conditions when the initial value of the acceleration of the sheet @xmath119 does not have a singularity at @xmath120 .",
    "the behavior of the jacobian @xmath109 of @xmath110 for the exact and quasiclassical solutions is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the figure shows that the approximate solution describes the behavior of the sheet well right up to the shock point , so later we will use only quasiclassical solution  ( [ quasi2 ] ) .",
    "an expression for the @xmath24 component of the plasma velocity should be added to formulas  ( [ quasi2 ] ) .",
    "it can be easily found from the equation @xmath121 , whose solution is an arbitrary function of the variable @xmath122 , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 the function @xmath125 is determined by an initial condition for the motion of the sheet in the @xmath24 direction at @xmath74 .",
    "the initial velocity @xmath126 can be arbitrary for an infinitely wide sheet .",
    "but since the real geometry of our problem is not flat , we may assume that @xmath127 .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath128 and the other components vanish .",
    "evolution of the current sheet causes a drastic change of the magnetic field , its energy , and the appearance of the electric field . due to the high speed of this process ( it lasts for only about @xmath129 )",
    ", the energy of the magnetic field is passed to the energy of the accelerated particles .",
    "acceleration is most effective in a region with the fastest evolution , i.e. near the singularity .",
    "let us consider acceleration of the charged particles in the vicinity of singularity .",
    "we assume that these particles are relativistic , so that @xmath130 , and that their fraction is small compared to the plasma density in the sheet .",
    "the singularity appears in the above solution of the mhd equations during the compression of the current sheet .",
    "the distribution function @xmath131 of relativistic particles in cartesian coordinates satisfies collisionless lioville s equation @xmath132 let us change the cartesian coordinates @xmath133 to the cylindrical ones @xmath134 in the momentum space . here",
    "@xmath135 is a component of the particle momentum along the magnetic field @xmath136 , @xmath31 is that perpendicular to the magnetic field , and @xmath137 is a rotation angle of the particle around the magnetic field , @xmath138 the force acting on the particles is the lorentz force @xmath139 \\right).\\ ] ] thus we have the kinetic equation @xmath140 \\frac{\\partial f_*}{\\partial \\varphi } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the cyclotron frequency of the particle rotation , @xmath142 .",
    "let us expand the function @xmath143 of @xmath137 into a fourier series and leave only the first 3 terms @xmath144 hence we get the system of equations for the functions @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 @xmath148 we need only know the function @xmath149 , which is independent of @xmath137 , because the other components of the distribution function make no contribution after the averaging over the rotation angle @xmath137 .",
    "we solve the second and the third equations for @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and substitute the result into the first equation .",
    "this procedure is simplified in two cases : ( a ) @xmath150 , ( b ) @xmath151 .    in the first case ,",
    "the cyclotron period is much less than the time scale of evolution of the distribution function .",
    "this condition is only violated close to the center of the sheet , where the magnetic field is zero and particles are not magnetized .",
    "the magnetic field is very strong in the case of the interaction between the supernova shock and the magnetized star ( @xmath152 gauss ) , therefore the region , where the particles are not magnetized , is negligibly small .",
    "hence we may assume that the condition ( a ) holds everywhere .",
    "substituting @xmath153 into the first equation , we obtain @xmath154 equation  ( [ kineq1 ] ) has a simple physical meaning .",
    "all particles move in the @xmath22 direction with a velocity of the electric drift @xmath155 , moreover the particles have an acceleration in this direction due to the variation of this velocity along the @xmath22 axis , and hence gain the transverse momentum @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that the acceleration @xmath156 tends to infinity at the shock point , @xmath157 the dependence of @xmath158 on the coordinate @xmath22 and the time @xmath159 is given by the formula  ( [ fields ] ) .",
    "now , it will be convenient to change variables from @xmath160 to @xmath161 .",
    "in the new variables  ( [ kineq1 ] ) reads @xmath162 we may assume that the distribution function of fast plasma particles is maxwellian at @xmath74 ( @xmath163 ) , and their density is proportional to the plasma density , i.e. the fraction of the accelerated injected particles is constant along the entire sheet @xmath164 the solution of kinetic equation  ( [ kineq2 ] ) with such initial conditions is @xmath165 it shows that the distribution function of the particles remains maxwellian , but the temperature is time - dependent @xmath166 .",
    "for @xmath167 the temperature is rising as @xmath168 tends to zero . at the moment @xmath169 the temperature becomes infinite , which means that the distribution function is constant in the region @xmath170 .",
    "note that the moment @xmath169 occurs before the shock for @xmath171 and these moments coincide if @xmath172 .",
    "the case @xmath172 corresponds to the initial distribution of density @xmath173 with constant initial plasma temperature along the entire sheet .",
    "though formally the particles are accelerated up to infinite energies , it is clear that the cyclotron radius of the fastest particles should be less than the typical thickness of the sheet @xmath174 , and also , that their cyclotron frequency should be greater than the inverse typical evolution time @xmath175 of the sheet .",
    "therefore , we have two estimates for @xmath176 : @xmath177 and @xmath178 , where @xmath179 can be found from the definition of @xmath168 and is estimated to be @xmath180 , @xmath181",
    ". finally we have @xmath182 .",
    "later we will see that @xmath183 for the actual values of the parameters , so we can assume that @xmath184 .",
    "the most interesting case for us is when @xmath172 , and in this case all plasma masses up at the moment of shock near the two planes @xmath185 , symmetric with respect to the center of the sheet .",
    "the estimate for @xmath186 is @xmath187 , it is reciprocal to the initial acceleration of the sheet @xmath188 , and , of course , @xmath186 should be less than the thickness of the sheet @xmath174 .",
    "the plasma velocity @xmath64 is positive for @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 , i.e. plasma particles move away from the center of the sheet into the regions around @xmath192 with a strong magnetic field . due to the strong magnetic field ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation becomes significant for the plasma particles ( electrons ) there . for @xmath193 and @xmath194",
    "the quasiclassical approximation used in the solution of the mhd equations is not applicable .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is almost constant at the large distances @xmath193 and @xmath194 from the center of the sheet , and its value is equal to the magnetic field at the boundary of the sheet . the electric field with the components @xmath195 and @xmath196 exists there as well , and plasma velocity in the electromagnetic field should be @xmath197 , where @xmath72 is the fast magnetic sound speed .",
    "thus , fast particles with the constant distribution function obtained above move into the regions with constant fields due to the electric drift and strongly radiate there .",
    "next , we find @xmath198 , the distribution function of these particles , and their radiation intensity @xmath199 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath200 and @xmath201 , i.e. the plasma motion is non - relativistic .",
    "in this case the drift velocity is @xmath202 .",
    "the function @xmath198 satisfies the following continuity equation in the phase space @xmath203 the force @xmath204 acting on the particles has the simplest expression in the reference frame moving with the velocity of the electric drift , where there is no electric field . since the drift is non - relativistic , this force is the same in the stationary reference frame .",
    "we use tildes for the values observed in the moving frame .",
    "the friction force due to radiation is  @xcite @xmath205 note that the magnetic field in the moving reference frame is @xmath206 , and components of the electric field are @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "let us denote @xmath209 the net force acting on the particles is @xmath210 again , change the cartesian coordinates @xmath133 to the cylindrical ones",
    "@xmath134 in the momentum space @xmath211 notice that a non - relativistic momentum addition rule was used here as the drift is non - relativistic .",
    "further , we neglect terms of the order higher than @xmath158 and @xmath212 in all calculations . under this approximation @xmath213 ,",
    "@xmath214 since divergence is a scalar value and the lorentz force is solenoidal , we have @xmath215 substituting the expressions obtained above in the original kinetic equation , and averaging it over the rotation angle @xmath137 , we obtain @xmath216 the identity @xmath217 is used here , it can be proved by expanding @xmath218 into a taylor series in powers of @xmath158 and @xmath212 and averaging over the angle @xmath137 .",

    "let us notice that that the constant distribution function of accelerated particles obtained in the previous section was the function of the transverse momentum @xmath31 . here ,",
    "in contrast , we use the isotropic function with the same parameters .",
    "the reason is that the plasma with strongly anisotropic particle distribution is very unstable with respect to the excitation of the electrostatic waves leading to fast isotropization .",

    "according to the papers of  @xcite , the typical moderate values for the sheet are :    the typical velocity of the fast magnetic sound is @xmath296 cm / s ,    the thickness of the sheet is @xmath297 cm ,    the typical value of the magnetic field is @xmath298 g ,    the plasma temperature in the sheet is @xmath299 kev .",
    "the time of the sheet compression can be estimated from equation  ( [ etadef ] ) and the condition @xmath300 @xmath301 now we can estimate the maximum value of the lorentz factor for the particles ( @xmath172 ) : @xmath302 the collimation @xmath265 of the radiation is determined by the parameter @xmath26 , @xmath303 , @xmath304 @xmath305 is the classical electron radius , @xmath306 cm . assuming @xmath307",
    ", we obtain @xmath308 , which yields the collimation angle , @xmath309 .",
    "the intensity of the accelerated particle radiation in the sheet is maximal at the frequency @xmath310 , which corresponds to the energies of the order of @xmath311 kev .",
    "asymptotic behavior of the spectrum as well as the frequency @xmath312 agree with the observed values of grbs  @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the more precise calculations for the model of cosmological grbs proposed by  @xcite confirm their estimations .",
    "evolution of the current sheet , particle acceleration due to the magnetic energy release , and the synchrotron radiation turn out to agree with what was estimated .",
    "the total radiated energy corresponds to the release of the magnetic energy stored in the sheet ( @xmath313 , see the papers of  @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalent radiated energy in the isotropic models is @xmath314 times greater , i.e. about @xmath315",
    ". the latter energy can be even greater for closer binary systems ( where the distance between a supernova precursor and the star - companion is less than @xmath316 ) , and it may reach values of @xmath317 .",
    "the proposed model explains the main characteristics of observed grbs .",
