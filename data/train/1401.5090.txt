    "water s dielectric properties are central to understanding water s role as a solvent and are important in areas such as climate science , remote sensing and microwave engineering .",
    "the great practical importance of water s dielectric properties has led to their measurement to high accuracy at a large gamut of state points.@xcite    a central question we seek to answer is what the relative effects of water model geometry , flexibility and polarization are on the dielectric constant . the usefulness of adding flexibility to water models has been investigated before with mixed results,@xcite and many polarizable models have likewise been created and investigated.@xcite critical comparisons of rigid vs. flexible and/or polarizable models have been done before with a focus on reproducing the density anomaly,@xcite ir spectra,@xcite water clusters,@xcite and h - bond dynamics.@xcite in this paper we examine the importance of both flexibility and polarizability on the dielectric properties of water .",
    "we do this by comparing three models with similar geometries - the rigid and flexible versions of tip4p/2005 and ttm3f , which is flexible and polarizable .    in the process of comparing these three models",
    "we compare the nature and degree of dipolar correlation in detail and investigate how this correlation contributes to the dielectric properties . to better understand the dielectric properties as a whole we ask if water can be understood as a relaxor ferroelectric .",
    "relaxor ferroelectrics are highly polarizable materials characterized by broad temperature dispersion in @xmath4 and the presence of polar nanoregions.@xcite      water is exceptional in its ability to form highly ordered phases under certain conditions .",
    "most strikingly , ice xi is a proton - ordered ferroelectric phase which forms when ice ih is cooled below 72 k. local ferroelectric ordering is preserved when ice xi is transformed into ice ih , leading to easier reformation of ice xi upon recooling.@xcite water confined in carbon nanotubes or membrane channels is believed to exhibit ferroelectric order.@xcitethe presence of an interface is known to influence the structure of water and degree of dipolar correlation up to several nanometers into the bulk.@xcite in biophysics , some proteins have  ferroelectric \" hydration shells with thicknesses of 3 - 5 water diameters,@xcite and antifreeze proteins are believed to influence water structure up to a nanometer into the bulk.@xcite    in bulk water the degree of dipolar correlation is well quantified by the kirkwood factor @xmath5 .",
    "assuming conducting boundary conditions , the dielectric constant can be calculated in a computer simulation using the following linear response relation : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the total dipole moment of the simulation box .",
    "@xmath8 for a rigid model and can be well estimated using the clausius - mossotti relation for flexible and polarizable models.@xcite to see the dependence of @xmath9 on dipolar correlation it is useful to recast equation [ eqnused ] as : @xmath10 here @xmath5 is the finite system g - factor .",
    "if we assume @xmath11 then @xmath12 @xmath13 is the average cosine of the angle between dipoles .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the finite system kirkwood factor @xmath5 and infinite system kirkwood factor @xmath14.@xcite @xmath14 was defined by kirkwood as:@xcite @xmath15 this equation is the exact equation for rigid dipoles in an infinite medium with no boundary at infinity.@xcite the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath5 varies considerably depending on the boundary conditions and method employed for treating the long range interactions.@xcite for ewald summation with conducting boundary conditions:@xcite @xmath16 note that equations [ kirkwoodeqn ] and [ gkgkrelation ] are only strictly correct for rigid dipoles ( @xmath8 ) , but we found that the correction to [ kirkwoodeqn ] from polarization contributes negligibly to @xmath14 ( about 1.5 % ) .@xcite looking at equation [ eqnused2 ] we see that if the dipoles are uncorrelated ( @xmath17 ) then @xmath18 and @xmath19 would equal 30 for water at 298 k ( assuming a dipole of @xmath20 d ) .",
    "the actual value is 78.4 , indicating that dipolar correlations increase @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "in bulk water it is well known that the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network increases dipolar correlation.@xcite if we assume a four - site tetrahedral bonding model with bonding probability @xmath22 and ignore all h - bond loops , then the contribution of the @xmath23th h - bonded shell to @xmath5 is given by:@xcite @xmath24 assuming @xmath25 and @xmath26 then this yields @xmath27 with contributions of @xmath28 .",
    "the importance of the h - bond network is confirmed in computer simulations which show a strong correlation between hydrogen bond density and dielectric constant.@xcite the importance of the h - bond network can also be inferred from the observation that dissolved solutes decrease @xmath9 . remarkably , the decrease in @xmath9 with solute concentration is largely independent of the type of solute,@xcite suggesting that the depression in @xmath9 is not due to local interaction of water with the solute but rather to the overall disruption of the h - bond network .",
    "the real h - bond network is not perfectly tetrahedral and contains loops and cooperative h - bonding effects .",
    "bulk water is populated by many different types of h - bonded structures with varying lifetimes .",
    "the concept of polar nanoregions ( pnrs ) may be useful towards understanding this situation .",
    "polar nanoregions are regions of dipole correlation on the nanometer scale which relax more or less independently of each other.@xcite polar nanoregions have been well characterized in several relaxor ferroelectrics , where they are found to range in size from 1 - 100 nm.@xcite    the average lifetime of pnrs clearly would be quantified by the debye relaxation time @xmath29 as it is computed in computer simulation .",
    "however , the relaxation time of some special structures may be much longer than others .",
    "perhaps the most striking evidence for long lived ( and long ranged ) dipole correlations in water comes from the analysis of the  site - dipole field \" first introduced by higo , et .",
    "al . in a study of",
    "spc / e.@xcite additionally , there are tantalizing experimental hints of very slow relaxations in the bulk.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]           for the models at different temperatures , calculated using @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the experimental data was calculated using experimental @xmath9@xcite using eqn .",
    "[ eqnused2 ] and @xmath32.,width=321 ]    the temperature derivative of @xmath9 is an important quantity which has been largely neglected in studies of water models .",
    "the temperature derivative is directly proportional to the change in entropy of the liquid under the application of an electric field.@xcite@xcite thus an accurate value of @xmath33 is important for capturing the change in the entropy ( ordering ) of the liquid around ions and predicting the solvation free energy of charged species.@xcite for this reason @xmath33 at 298/300k is compared for some popular water models in table [ watermodels ] .",
    "interestingly , spc / e greatly underestimates @xmath33 while tip3p overestimates it .",
    "spc / e and tip3p are the two most popular explicit water models in the biophysics community.@xcite of the water models listed , ttm3f most accurately captures the slope at 300 k.    it is also useful to look at the temperature dependence of @xmath5 when comparing the models ( see figure [ gkvst ] ) .",
    "all three models overestimate the degree of correlation but ttm3f yields the correct monotonic decrease in @xmath5 with increasing temperature , while tip4p/2005 and tip4p/2005f show an unphysical increase in @xmath5 with temperature between 240 and 300 k and then little change at higher temperatures .",
    "ttm3f exhibits temperature dependence of @xmath34 even at fixed density , as shown in figure [ muvstemp ] .",
    "this is likely the distinguishing factor which allows ttm3f to have a better temperature derivative compared to the other models .",
    "is plagued by noise from the fitting process.,width=321 ]        figure  [ epsomega ] shows the real and imaginary dielectric functions .",
    "the experimental data between 50 - 33,333 @xmath35 ( 1.5 @xmath36 10@xmath37 - 10@xmath38 hz ) was taken from index of fraction data using the relation @xmath39.@xcite    of particular interest is the the feature centered at 180 - 200 @xmath35 which is most clearly present in @xmath40 .",
    "neumann noted that this feature is absent in the dielectric spectra of tip4p and proposed that it must be due to polarization effects.@xcite raman and fir spectra of water also show a band between 170 - 190 @xmath35.@xcite the exact nature of the 180 @xmath35 raman band has been the subject of some controversy.@xcite the prevailing view is that it is due to the stretching vibrations of nearly - linear hydrogen bonds , but others have interpreted it as being due to cage vibrations or more exotic hydrogen bond network relaxations.@xcite    if the feature at 180 - 200 @xmath35 is indeed due to the stretching of hydrogen bonds , then it will only appear in @xmath0 if polarization is included , as the geometric dipoles of two h - bonded molecules do not change during h - bond stretching .",
    "indeed , the ttm3f spectrum shows a shallow peak in this region , while the flexible tip4p/2005 shows nothing .",
    "the fact that the ttm3f peak is smaller than experiment makes sense considering that the hydrogens are not polarizable in ttm3f and the only polarization dipole is located on the m - site .    at high frequencies we see that both ttm3f and tip4p/2005f do a good job of reproducing the librational resonances and the bending ( @xmath41 ) and symmetric & antisymmetric modes ( @xmath42 ) , with ttm3f performing noticeably better in reproducing @xmath40 . using the clausius - mossotti equation we calculated @xmath43 for ttm3f to be 1.76 using the polarizability of the polarization dipole only .",
    "the molecular polarizability from flexibility was estimated by calculating the change in dipole due to bending in an electric field oriented along the hoh bisector .",
    "for tip4p/2005f we found @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ tempdependence ] shows the temperature dependence of the real part of the dielectric constant @xmath45 at different frequencies . to our knowledge",
    "such plots have only been presented once before for water , on the website of m. chaplin.@xcite    according to a review article on relaxor ferroelectrics ,  a universal signature of the relaxor state is a broad frequency - dependent peak in the real part of the temperature - dependent dielectric susceptibility\".@xcite the  experimental data \" here comes from a two - debye fit function for @xmath46 derived from experimental data by meissner and wentz.@xcite it was shown that this fitting function well reproduces the experimental data for @xmath47 between 273 and 373 k. of particular interest is the temperature dependence of the @xmath45 peak , which is better captured by ttm3f .",
    "the temperature dependence of both @xmath29 and @xmath48 is best described by the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) equation : @xmath49 ( see the supplementary material for a comparison of the vft fit with other fitting functions.@xcite ) this fact is very interesting because vft relaxation is a universal feature of relaxor ferroelectrics and dipolar glasses.@xcite the underlying origin of the vft equation is not very well understood , but most theories assume a distribution of relaxation environments within the bulk . an influential theory for the vft equation",
    "is the adam - gibbs model , which assumes the existence of cooperatively rearranging regions.@xcite the cooperatively rearranging concept is nearly identical to the polar nanoregion concept used to describe relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "the fact that the debye relaxation is larger than the single molecule relaxation function is a direct consequence of dipolar correlations . a model which assumes spherical relaxation clusters ( analogous to pnrs ) predicts @xmath50.@xcite a comparison of the three models studied here shows little difference in @xmath51 or @xmath3 between the models ( figure [ tauscomparison ] ) .",
    "thus the introduction of polarization does not appear to significantly effect the debye or single molecule relaxation times .",
    "for sub - boxes of different sizes , tip4p/2005 at 300 k. the total boxes contained either 512 , 1,000 , 10,000 or 28,178 molecules .",
    "for the 512 molecule box the sub - boxes had sizes of @xmath52 3 , 6 , 10 and 24.8 @xmath53 corresponding to boxes with approximately 1 , 7 , 33 and 512 molecules .",
    "care was taken to use a consistent fitting procedure .",
    "the error was estimated to be 5% or less.,width=321 ]    the relaxation times of sub - boxes of different sizes gives information about the size of the polar nanoregions responsible for the debye relaxation time .",
    "we broke the simulation cell into boxes of different sizes and calculated the total dipole moment of each box at each timestep .",
    "the dipole correlation function is computed separately for each box and then averaged over all boxes .",
    "figure [ tau_vs_size ] shows the resulting dependence of of the relaxation time @xmath54 on the box size .",
    "a convergence of @xmath54 appears to be reached when @xmath55 , however beyond this @xmath54 begins to decrease in large boxes .",
    "the reason for this decrease is unknown , but is likely due to the artifact from periodic boundary conditions ( discussed below ) , which causes decorrelation at long distances . averaging over non - overlapping spheres with diameter @xmath56 gives the same result ( not shown ) .",

    "the cosine function simply gives the average cosine of the angle between the dipole moments of two molecules as a function of @xmath57 : @xmath58 the prime on the summation indicates that we do not include @xmath59 . in everything that follows ,",
    "angle brackets indicate an ensemble average . the cosine function is shown in figure [ costheta ] .",
    "oxygen - oxygen rdfs are shown for reference to emphasize that the peaks in the cosine function do not necessarily overlap with the rdf peaks , since the cosine function does not contain any information about the density of molecules .",
    "we clearly see that ttm3f has much larger correlation , especially in the first shell .",

    "the region of the second h - bonded shell ( 4 - 5 @xmath53 ) contains both positive and negative contributions . in such plots",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the contributions from h - bonded shells and non h - bonded shells , since they overlap considerably .",

    "the kirkwood correlation function accounts for this by reporting the total correlation of dipoles in a sphere of radius @xmath57 normalized only by the dipole moment of the central molecule .    since @xmath65 is more sensitive to small correlations at large distances , it is also more sensitive to artifacts arising from the use of periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) and ewald summation.@xcite when pbcs and ewald summation are used @xmath65 begins to artificially grow beyond a certain point which we found is usually around half the minimum image distance ( @xmath71 ) .",

    "the @xmath65 data clearly shows the relative contributions from different h - bonded shells to @xmath5 and therefore to the dielectric constant .",
    "flexibility decreases @xmath65 slightly in tip4p/2005 , which might be due to a weaker h - bond network .",
    "on the other hand , ttm3f @xmath65 exhibits larger @xmath65 values and displays a more pronounced contribution from the second shell .",
    "the third and fourth shells do not contribute to @xmath5 in any of the models but appear more pronounced in ttm3f .",
    "further insight can be gained by breaking @xmath65 into axial and equatorial components:@xcite @xmath73 if a dipole is embedded in a homogeneous dielectric continuum , the axial region is a region of positive correlation , while the equatorial is anti - correlated .",
    "the two regions are separated by a conical surface at an angle of @xmath74 . unlike the continuum case ,",
    "the equatorial component is _ correlated _ ( negative ) in water out to about 1.2 nm due to the h - bond network ( fig .",
    "[ largegkr ] ) . in our simulations with 1,000 molecules",
    "the equatorial component remains negative even at large distances due to the artifact ( fig .",
    "[ gkrcomparison ] ) .",
    "the one dimensional angular correlation functions are useful for measuring the overall correlation in each shell but do not contain any information about the structure within shells . fully capturing the geometric correlations between molecules requires calculating the full pair correlation function @xmath75 which has ( for a rigid non - linear molecules ) seven dimensions - a distance @xmath57 and three angles for each molecule ( ie .",
    "euler angles ) .",
    "thus some reduction of information is necessary and many different reductions are possible . to better understand the structure we use follow the approach of matthias & tavan@xcite to produce 2d plots using two variables - a radial distance @xmath76 between molecules and the angle @xmath77 , which is the angle between the dipole moment of molecule @xmath23 and @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath79 corresponds to the direction of the dipole moment ( axial direction ) , which is called the  z \" axis .",

    "the rigid and flexible versions of tip4p/2005 are not compared here since they are nearly identical in appearance .",
    "perhaps the most striking thing about these plots is their similarity  differences in magnitude are not very visible here .",
    "several small differences can be observed , however .",
    "the first shell in ttm3f is more spread out and thus has a smaller maxima ( 6.52 vs. 9.35 ) .",
    "the ttm3f 2d cosine function exhibits slightly more structure and anti - correlation in the interstitial regions .    in the supplementary material",
    "2d correlation functions for 1000 spc / e and tip3p are also presented.@xcite in all five of the models presented the dipole correlations resemble a dielectric continuum at distances larger than 1.5 nm , confirming the findings of mathias & tavan .",
    "we propose that this distance corresponds to the largest possible radius of the polar nanoregions .",
    "a sphere with @xmath86 nm contains around 424 molecules .",
    "a similar maximum radius can also be deduced from the @xmath54 vs box size data or from @xmath65 .",
    "the results indicate that the addition of flexibility to a model , when no other reparameterizations are done , has little effect on the dielectric properties except at high frequencies .",
    "the introduction of polarization , however , does have a significant effect in several regards .",
    "firstly , it introduces significant temperature and density dependence to the the dipole moment resulting in better values for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "an accurate value for @xmath87 ensures that the entropy change in an electric field is described accurately , even at fixed temperature .",
    "secondly , polarization better reproduces @xmath89 , especially the 200 @xmath35 h - bond stretching feature and high - frequency features .",
    "finally , polarization enhances dipole correlation and leads to a more physically accurate change in dipole correlation with temperature .",
    "this indicates that _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water will have larger dipole correlations . as a consequence , the analysis of local dipolar order in the form of polar nanoregions might be relevant to understanding such simulations .",
