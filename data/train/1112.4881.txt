    "<S> the set of @xmath30-nondegenerate polynomials with respect to a polytope @xmath30 forms an open subset in the affine space parameterizing their coefficients @xmath34 : under mild hypothesis , such as when @xmath30 contains a unimodular simplex , then this subset is zariski dense . </S>",
    "<S> ( see batyrev and cox @xcite as a reference for this notion as well as the work of castryck and the second author @xcite for a detailed analysis of nondegenerate curves . ) </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish here between @xmath35 and @xmath36 which is the convex closure of @xmath37 : for the laurent polynomial @xmath38 in @xmath39 variables , @xmath14 is @xmath30-nondegenerate if and only if @xmath38 is nondegenerate with respect to @xmath36 in the sense of kouchnirenko @xcite , adophson and sperber @xcite , and others . </S>",
    "<S> nondegenerate hypersurfaces are an attractive class to consider because many of their geometric properties can be deduced from the combinatorics of their newton polytopes .    </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath47 be the normalized volume of @xmath30 , so that a unit hypercube @xmath48^n$ ] has normalized volume @xmath49 and the unit simplex @xmath50 has normalized volume @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> we say that @xmath30 is _ confined _ if @xmath30 is contained in an orthotope ( box ) with side lengths @xmath52 with @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we say that @xmath14 is _ confined _ if @xmath35 is confined . </S>",
    "<S> a slight extension of a theorem of lagarias and ziegler @xcite shows that every polytope @xmath30 is @xmath54-equivalent to a confined polytope ; this existence can also be made effective . </S>",
    "<S> ( see section 3 for more detail . ) in other words , for each laurent polynomial @xmath14 there is a computable monomial change of basis of @xmath55 $ ] , giving rise to an equality of zeta functions , under which @xmath14 is confined . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the theorem below , at the expense of introducing a factor of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 where @xmath58 , one can remove the assumption that @xmath30 is confined . )    for functions @xmath59 , we say that @xmath60 if there exists @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that for every @xmath63 we have @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the reader is warned that not all properties familiar to big - oh notation for functions of one variable extend to the multivariable case ; see howell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our analysis also holds with howell s more restrictive definition , but we will not pursue this further here . ) </S>",
    "<S> we further use the `` soft - oh '' notation , where @xmath65 if @xmath66 for some @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> then there exists an explicit algorithm that , on input a nondegenerate laurent polynomial @xmath69 $ ] with @xmath70 and an integer @xmath71 , computes as output @xmath72 modulo @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> if further @xmath14 is confined , then this algorithm uses @xmath74 bit operations .    to recover the zeta function ( as an element of @xmath75 ) , </S>",
    "<S> if we fix both the dimension and the number @xmath76 of monomials , we have the following result .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath68 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> then there exists an explicit algorithm that , on input a confined , nondegenerate laurent polynomial @xmath69 $ ] with @xmath78 and @xmath40 , computes as output @xmath72 using @xmath79 bit operations .    </S>",
    "<S> according to a theorem of adolphson and sperber @xcite , under the hypothesis that @xmath14 is nondegenerate , @xmath80 is a polynomial of degree @xmath81 times @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the context of theorem b , if @xmath83 is small ( or fixed ) , then our algorithm runs in polynomial time in the ( dense ) output size , which is the best one could hope for ( aside from minimizing the degree of this polynomial ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( the fewnomial input size , on the other hand , is @xmath84 for @xmath14 confined and @xmath15 fixed . )    in our theorem , we require the dimension @xmath15 to be fixed for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , we employ well - known algorithms for lattice polytopes which have only been analyzed assuming that the dimension is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> ( they further assume that arithmetic operations in @xmath43 take time @xmath85 , which is nearly valid in the usual bit - complexity model if @xmath30 is confined and @xmath15 is fixed ; for a discussion of this point , see section 3 . ) </S>",
    "<S> second , it is often quite natural from a geometric point of view to consider the dimension to be fixed ; one often considers families of hypersurfaces of a fixed dimension , for example . finally , allowing fewnomial input and output and varying dimension , the problem of computing @xmath72 is harder than the np - complete problem 3- ( indeed , for the latter one only wishes to know if @xmath86 for an affine hypersurface @xmath87 of degree @xmath88 ) . for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> , we restrict our analysis ( continuing below ) to fixed dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> our method follows in the same vein as other recently introduced @xmath1-adic cohomological techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the methods of lauder and wan @xcite mentioned above compute @xmath72 for a polynomial @xmath14 of total degree @xmath89 using @xmath90 bit operations . </S>",
    "<S> the dense input size of @xmath14 is @xmath91 ; consequently if the prime @xmath1 ( and dimension @xmath15 ) are fixed then their algorithm runs in polynomial time in the dense input size . </S>",
    "<S> their method , although apparently not practical , is completely general and does not require any hypothesis on @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> our method can be analyzed on dense input ( see section 5 ) as well , running in time @xmath92 with no condition on the number of monomials in the support of @xmath14 .    in a different direction , kedlaya @xcite </S>",
    "<S> ( see also the presentation by edixhoven @xcite ) used monsky - washnitzer cohomology to compute the zeta function of a hyperelliptic curve of genus @xmath93 over @xmath2 in time @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note here that the dense input size is @xmath95 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been taken up by several others : see , for example , work of abbott , kedlaya , and roe @xcite , who compute the zeta function of a projective hypersurface by working in the complement of the hypersurface and using mumford reduction . </S>",
    "<S> ( indeed , kedlaya has suggested that there should be a natural extension @xcite of his ideas to the realm of toric hypersurfaces . ) </S>",
    "<S> our method also mirrors the algorithm of castryck , denef , and vercauteren @xcite , who tackle the case of nondegenerate curves . </S>",
    "<S> their method has good asymptotic behavior but to be practical needs an optimized implementation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , rather than following this vein and working with monsky - washnitzer ( @xmath1-adic de rham ) cohomology , we employ the cohomology theory of dwork , which has a more combinatorial flavor .    in a yet further direction , </S>",
    "<S> lauder has used dwork s theory of @xmath1-adic differential equations to compute zeta functions using deformation @xcite and recursion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frobenius , acting on the members of a one - parameter family , satisfies a differential equation coming from the gauss - manin connection . </S>",
    "<S> lauder uses this equation to solve for the action given an initial condition arising from the action on the cohomology of a simple variety which one can compute directly . </S>",
    "<S> our method fits into this framework as it provides natural base varieties to deform from : indeed , the idea of deformation in the context of nondegenerate curves has been pursued by tuitman @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the methods of lauder show that one can compute @xmath8 for a smooth projective hypersurface @xmath96 of degree @xmath89 with @xmath97 and nonvanishing diagonal terms in time @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation method has also been pursued fruitfully by gerkmann @xcite and others in different contexts .    </S>",
    "<S> adapting an idea of chudnovsky and chudnovsky and bostan , gaudry , and schost @xcite for accelerated reduction , harvey @xcite has improved kedlaya s method for hyperelliptic curves , with a runtime of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this approach appears to extend to higher dimensions as well , extending the method of abbott , kedlaya , and roe @xcite : his method appears to give a runtime of @xmath100 under a smoothness hypothesis analogous to the condition of nondegeneracy ( but somewhat weaker ) . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to see how his ideas for lowering the exponent on @xmath1 might apply in our situation .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in section 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the cohomology theory of dwork and give an overview of our method . </S>",
    "<S> in section 2 , we discuss each step of the algorithm in turn : computing the splitting function and the jacobian ring , the computation of frobenius ( where the condition of sparsity enters ) , and the reduction theory in cohomology . in section 3 , </S>",
    "<S> we give some algorithms for computing with polytopes . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss running time and precision estimates for the complete algorithm in section 4 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section 5 we discuss the case @xmath101 and consider some other possible modifications . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude in section 6 with some examples . </S>"
