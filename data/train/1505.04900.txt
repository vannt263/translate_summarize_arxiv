    "the three peaks in the fluorescence spectrum correspond to the transitions ( arrows ) between the dressed states indicated by c ( dash - dotted ) , l ( dashed ) , u ( solid ) , respectively in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) . from the illustration ,",
    "the side peak ( say the upper , u ) is successively followed by emissions of the other side ( l ) or central ( c ) peaks . therefore , successive two - photon emission within the same side peak is strongly suppressed if the splitting between the dressed states is larger than the line width ( @xmath199 if the linewidth is limited by the emitter lifetime ) .",
    "this scheme to produce highly efficient and distinguishable single photons has been studied in recent years with qd emitters  @xcite , in which the spectral filtering of a side peak emission ( say @xmath200 ) is essential . in this scheme ,",
    "the major cause of the contamination noise on the sp purity is the other two emission peaks ( @xmath201 ) and the excitation laser itself ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "the main physics can be described by a resonantly driven two - level system , @xmath203+\\gamma_{sp}{\\mathcal",
    "l}_{{\\hat \\sigma}^- } { \\hat \\rho}+(\\gamma_{\\rm ph}/2 ) { \\mathcal l}_{{\\hat \\sigma}_z } { \\hat \\rho},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath204 in the rotating frame , and @xmath170 and @xmath171 are the spontaneous emission and dephasing rates .",
    "here we set the dephasing rate @xmath205 according to the experimental reports showing lifetime limited linewidth  @xcite . for the calculation of the emission properties ,",
    "we define the emission field operator by @xmath206 , and the central frequency of the filter @xmath19 is set @xmath207 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] ( c ) , shows the simulated @xmath189 of the upper side peak emissions spectrally filtered by the three types of filters , lorentzian ( black ) , gaussian ( green ) , rectangular ( magenta ) filters .",
    "the @xmath189 is plotted as a function of the filter bandwidth @xmath20 , which shows a minimum in the regime @xmath208 reflecting the physics of sp generation mentioned above ; if @xmath209 , @xmath189 decreases as @xmath20 decreases since the spectral selection for the side peak becomes effective . on the other hand , for @xmath20 much less than the spontaneous emission rate @xmath170 or the linewidth ( @xmath210 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( c ) ) , @xmath189 increases as @xmath20 decreases due to the degraded time resolution .",
    "the @xmath189 at the minima depends on the types of the spectral filters , being similar to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) , the result for an incoherely pumped qd . in this case",
    ", however , the gaussian filter gives the smallest @xmath189 i.e. the most pure sp emission , and the lorentzian filter gives the worst purity for @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( c ) . here",
    ", we again note that our results for lorentzian filter perfectly agree with those obtained by using the other method  @xcite , numerically showing the validity of our method .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( d ) , the @xmath189 at the minima is shown as a function of the ratio between the rabi frequency over the linewidth , @xmath212 .",
    "it is clearly found that @xmath189 at the minima decreases ( i.e. the sp purity increases ) as @xmath213 increases .",
    "this is because the contamination source i.e. the other emission peaks , c and l , become spectrally separated and suppressed well by the filters for larger splitting , @xmath213 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the lorentzian filter gives @xmath189 larger than others i.e. the performance to obtain high sp purity is the lowest among the three types , while the rectangular filter was the worst choice in the case of incoherent excitation in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( c ) . moreover , an interesting result is that the most efficient filter type to give the highest sp purity depends on the pump parameter @xmath213 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( d ) . for the rabi",
    "splitting not too large @xmath214 , the gaussian filter with the smallest @xmath189 is the best choice among the three . for the strong rabi field @xmath215 , the rectangular filter with the smallest @xmath189 is the best filter type .",
    "we should note here that the latter case especially is quite different from the result of incoherent excitation in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( c ) .",
    "a simple explanation for this nontrivial matching between the filter and emitter remains elusive .",
    "in general , the matching between filter types and emitters will depend on the non - universal details of the pumping and emission dynamics .",
    "therefore , the numerical simulation under given conditions and the direct comparison between different filters are necessary to tailor and optimize the quantum emissions .",
    "we proposed a calculation method , based on the superoperator eigenvalue decomposition technique , for photon statistics of spectrally filtered fields with various types of filters .",
    "this method can give exact results when the emission dynamics is given by quantum master equations , which can be applied to a wide variety of quantum emitters , and solvable with the eigenvalue approach ( matrix diagonalization ) .",
    "also , it is possible to treat a wide variety of filter function if analytic expressions for the convolution functions , @xmath98 and @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensitygens ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zi])-([eq : ziii ] ) , are obtained .    as typical examples , focusing on three filter types , lorentzian , gaussian , and rectangular filters",
    ", we applied this method to qd single photon ( sp ) emitters . with the simulation for two cases , under incoherent excitations and under coherent and resonant excitations",
    ", we found condition - dependent non - universal matching between filter - types and emitters in order to have the highest sp purity .",
    "an interesting issue remaining will be extending this method to simulations for periodic and short - pulsed pumping , which will allow us to study the effect of the spectral filtering in case of short - pulse excitations aiming at more realistic operations of the qd sp source  @xcite .",
