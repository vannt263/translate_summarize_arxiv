    "execution of foreign exchange transactions at a fixed market benchmark rate is common amongst institutional investors .",
    "appeal lies in the fact that , particularly when tracking benchmark indices in other asset classes , currency conversion can be performed by the same underlying fx rates as employed by their target index .",
    "furthermore , aggregation of fixing trades by market makers prior to execution increases liquidity , which , in theory , enables clients to trade large fx amounts at a trusted rate , without having to worry about best execution or the risk of moving the price .",
    "moreover , as a market fix is uniform across providers , it is also intended to build trust in client / provider relationships , as a clearly defined and measurable service arises .",
    "the currently most important benchmark rate is the world market reuters 4 pm london fix ( wm / r 4 pm ) , which accounts for approximately @xmath0-@xmath1 of the total @xmath2 daily volume in the fx spot market @xcite .",
    "the wm / r 4 pm fixing rate @xcite is determined using the methodology described in [ sec_wmrfix ] .",
    "it is based on the last trade prices as well as the last best bid and offer quotes at the end of each one second interval between 15:59:30 to 16:00:30 gmt . therefore , to achieve the wm / r rate ,",
    "service providers execute their fixing orders within this 60 second interval .",
    "compression of large order flow into a narrow time window can be expected to give rise to a special market structure around the fixing time , which is part of what we will look at in this paper .",
    "the described structure has recently come to the attention of the wider public , as concerns have been raised regarding market participants who may have used the construction mechanism of the wm / r 4 pm fix to influence the benchmark @xcite .",
    "subsequently , multiple suggestions regarding how to improve the construction of the wm / r 4 pm fix have been brought forward @xcite .",
    "these investigations mainly focus on the mitigation of eventual manipulation possibilities .",
    "generally , little research has been done on the observable market structure around the wm / r 4 pm fix @xcite , despite the importance of the wm / r 4 pm fix in the services received by many institutional investors .    in this",
    "regard , spot rate volatility and extreme spot rate movements are of particular interest , since they are important parameters in the quest for best execution practice .",
    "some analysis has been done in the context of general interactions between clients and dealers @xcite , with the recent focus shifting onto the impact of algorithmic order execution @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the influence of the wm / r 4 pm fix on the dynamics of both , spot rate volatility and extreme spot rate movements .",
    "our study shows that the order compression of the fix indeed changes the market behaviour , resulting in spiking volatility within the wm / r fixing window , and an increased probability for spot rate extrema in this period .",
    "before discussing the market dynamics around the fix , a short description of its construction shall be provided @xcite .",
    "the fixing rate is determined for currency spot , forward , and non - deliverable forward rates .",
    "the calculation differs between forward and spot rates .",
    "while , for the former , a single rate snapshot at the fixing time is used as the benchmark , the spot rate calculation utilises several price quotes within an interval around the fixing time . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on spot rates only .",
    "spot fixings are determined for 160 currency pairs , which are split into trade currencies for liquid pairs and quote currencies for illiquid pairs . for our analysis",
    ", we consider trade currency pairs .",
    "market data is sourced from thomson reuters , ebs , and currenex .",
    "currently , all trade currency data is obtained from a primary source . for currency pairs involving chf , eur , and jpy , data from ebs",
    "currenex data supplements it as a secondary source , if the number of datapoints is too low .",
    "rub data is solely obtained from ebs .",
    "benchmark rates for other pairs are based on thomson reuters data only .",
    "the fix rate is obtained by accumulating quote and trade data within a set time interval around the fixing time . at present , this interval is 1-min . for trade currencies and 2-min . for quote currencies ,",
    "i.e. , for the 4 pm fix ( _ closing rate _ ) the accumulation times are 15:59:30 - 16:00:30 and 15:59:00 - 16:01:00 , respectively .",
    "notably , following recent recommendations @xcite , wm / r is aiming to implement changes to its calculation methodology @xcite , which will become effective on the 15/02/2015 . thereafter",
    ", the data sourcing window is widened to @xmath3 , i.e. , for the 4 pm fix the accumulation time changes to 15:57:30 - 16:02:30 .",
    "additionally , trade currency data will be gathered from different sources . to this end",
    ", thomson reuters data is pooled together with ebs and currenex data for pairs containing chf , eur , jpy , and rub .",
    "quote currency data is sampled at the end of 15-sec .",
    "intervals , leading to 9 datapoints in total . at each sampling point , the last valid best bid and ask quotes are recorded .",
    "subsequently , the medians of these bid and ask quotes are calculated , whose mid - price yields the wm / r benchmark rate .    for trade currencies ,",
    "a more elaborate method is used , which is illustrated in figure [ fig_wmrmethod ] .",
    "data is sourced at the end of each 1-sec .",
    "interval @xmath4 , which amounts to 61 datapoints in total .",
    "the last valid best bid and ask quotes , as well as the last rate at which a trade happened in the interval , are captured .",
    "to calculate the fixing rate for trade currencies , firstly , the spread @xmath5 of the best bid and offer quotes is determined for each interval .",
    "subsequently , the trade rate is categorised into a bid trade or an offer trade , depending on whether the trade hit a quote on the bid or the offer side of the order book .",
    "the spread @xmath5 is applied to the trade to infer the opposite side of the order book , resulting in an inferred trade rate at that side .",
    "trades that fall outside the best bid and offer quotes , i.e. , trades which were executed hitting quotes inside the order book , are excluded from the calculation . combining the inferred and actual trade rates",
    "ideally yields subsets for the bid and the offer side containing a total of 61 datapoints each ( bid trades and offer trades in figure [ fig_wmrmethod ] ) .",
    "notably , this assumes that a valid trade occurs within each of the 1-sec .",
    "intervals , which is not necessarily the case . if there is insufficient trade rate data , bid and offer quotes are used instead . the exact limit on",
    "the number of required trade datapoints is discretionary to wm / r and unpublished .",
    "in such a case , quote data is not pooled together from different data sources , but rather data from the source with the largest number of valid quotes is used .        for each side ,",
    "i.e. , bid trades and offer trades , the median of the rates is computed . the mid - price between the median bid and median offer trades",
    "yields the wm / r fix .",
    "its spread is given by a predefined standard spread @xmath6 for each currency pair , which is supposed to reflect the liquidity at different times of the day .",
    "the determination of this standard spread is discretionary .",
    "however , if the market spread @xmath7 , defined as the mean over all spreads @xmath5 obtained from the quote data , is larger than the standard spread , @xmath7 will be used instead . applying this spread to the wm / r fix",
    "yields its bid and ask rates .    for both , trade and quote currencies ,",
    "the initially sourced data is subject to quality checks , which compare it to the general market level .",
    "this level is established from continuous market surveillance by capturing trade rates at every 15-sec . throughout the entire day .",
    "quality checks happen automatically , testing for data consistency @xcite , as well as on a discretionary basis , for which no detailed methodology has been published .",
    "the mechanism for determining the wm / r closing spot rate suffers from two main weaknesses . on the one hand",
    ", it does not take into account volume information . ignoring spot rate modifications arising from market impact ,",
    "trade rates obtained from the execution of large orders contribute with the same weight to the benchmark as orders at the minimum size . on the other hand , capturing solely the last quote and trade rates at the end of a macroscopic time interval ignores market microdynamics .",
    "market trends happening towards the end of each interval have the potential to affect the data used in benchmark calculation .",
    "for instance , the splitting of a large order into many transactions , distributed over the fixing interval , with each transaction selectively executed towards the end of the 1-sec .",
    "wide data aggregation intervals , can result in a modification of the benchmark in the direction of the order .",
    "for our analysis , we use spot rate data sourced from bloomberg , for a total of 12 currency pairs .",
    "the data has a minute - by - minute resolution , and contains four different price streams .",
    "these are the opening , the highest , the lowest , and the last spot rate obtained within each 1-min . interval .",
    "since the opening rate corresponds to the closing rate of the previous point , our analysis only focuses on the latter three time series .",
    "each interval is centred at the minute , i.e. , datapoints are , for example , obtained at 15:59 , 16:00 and 16:01 .",
    "the time indices are expressed in local london time .",
    "as occasionally there are minute entries missing in the datasets , the data is filtered for completeness , and days containing incomplete datasets have been excluded from the evaluation .",
    "this is done because parts of our analysis rely on the comparison between spot rates at different minutes .",
    "due to data availability , the look - back periods vary between the currency pairs as follows :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we report on the observation of a change in market dynamics around 4 pm london time , introduced by the wm / r closing rate .",
    "the compression of large order flow into the short time interval , considered for determining the wm / r fix , gives rise to local extrema in volatility .",
    "moreover , it increases the probability for extreme movements in the spot rate .",
    "both effects happen predominantly in anticipation of the event , i.e. , before 4 pm .",
    "this sets the 4 pm market dynamics apart from the one observed for other market relevant events , such as information arrival .",
    "unlike such events , whose effects lead to longer term distortions in the market dynamics , the observed spot rate extrema are confined to a short interval on the order of the fixing window size . while fx execution to the fix has its advantages in terms of convenience , our analysis shows that this comes at the expense of an increased probability for the investor to be subject to the most extreme daily market movements .    in recent months",
    ", the occurrence probability for such spot rate extrema around the fixing window has decreased .",
    "the reduction coincides with an increase media attention paid to the wm / r closing rate benchmark .",
    "this could be indicative for a change in the behaviour of market participants , who selectively walk away from execution at the wm / r fix to avoid these drawbacks .",
