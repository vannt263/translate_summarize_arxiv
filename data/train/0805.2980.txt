    "there is currently considerable interest in preparing exotic quantum states of many - body systems which can be used as resource states for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  that is , quantum computation that proceeds solely through local adaptive measurements on single quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the canonical example of such a resource state is the cluster state  @xcite , which is a universal resource for mbqc on suitable lattices or graphs  @xcite . it may be possible to prepare such a cluster state dynamically in atomic systems such as an optical lattice  @xcite or using single photons  @xcite",
    "however , one exciting possibility is that such resource states might be the non - degenerate ground state of a `` natural '' hamiltonian lattice system .",
    "if the system is gapped , then one simply needs to cool it sufficiently in order to obtain the desired state ( although , even for gapped systems , this cooling process may be difficult  @xcite ) .    consider the cluster state on a lattice",
    "@xmath0 , defined as the unique @xmath1 eigenstate of a set of stabilizer operators @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the pauli @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) operator at site @xmath7 and where @xmath8 denotes that @xmath9 is connected to @xmath7 by a bond in the lattice @xmath0 . the hamiltonian @xmath10 with @xmath11 an energy constant , has the cluster state as its unique ground state  @xcite . in addition , this system is gapped ( the gap is @xmath12 ) , and such a system can be cooled efficiently  @xcite .",
    "however , for any non - trivial lattice or graph , this hamiltonian involves many - body interactions , as opposed to the two - body interactions that occur frequently in nature .",
    "an obvious question , then , is whether it is possible to realize any given highly - entangled quantum state as the ground state of a hamiltonian with only two - body interactions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that this is not possible in general , and nielsen  @xcite used this result to prove that a cluster state on a computationally universal ( i.e. , two - dimensional or higher ) lattice can not arise as the ground state of a hamiltonian with only two - body interactions .",
    "however , investigations into quantum complexity theory  @xcite have demonstrated that cluster states ( and other such states that are universal ) can be _ approximated _ by the ground state of a local two - body hamiltonian .",
    "the key idea is to make use of `` mediating '' ancilla qubits to create an effective many - body coupling out of two - body interactions .",
    "the problem with such methods is that the detailed parameters in the perturbing hamiltonian must be controlled with a precision that increases with the size of the system  @xcite , making such approaches impractical for the task of creating cluster states on large lattices .    using an alternate method based on the idea behind projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite , bartlett and rudolph",
    "@xcite proved that it was possible to obtain a state that closely approximates an _ encoded _ cluster state on a square lattice using a hamiltonian with only two - body nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "in addition , they proved that mbqc can proceed using such an encoded resource state , still requiring only adaptive single - qubit measurements .    in this paper , we present a general method for constructing two - body nearest - neighbour hamiltonian systems for which the ground state encodes a cluster state , based on the techniques of  @xcite .",
    "our rigorous application of perturbation theory reveals errors in the calculation of the energy gap for the square lattice investigated in  @xcite ( although these errors do not affect their key result ) and we provide a correct treatment of this case .",
    "we also investigate the cluster state on a one - dimensional line ( useful for illustration , as well as for its application as a quantum wire  @xcite ) , a hexagonal lattice in two - dimensions  a universal mbqc resource with the best scaling of the energy gap in perturbation , and the cubic lattice in three - dimensions  a resource state for which fault - tolerance thresholds have been found  @xcite .",
    "we explicitly characterise the effects of fixed boundary conditions on the lattice , proving that such boundary conditions do not affect the main result .",
    "finally , we provide an outline of a proof that this method yields an encoded cluster state as the ground state on any graph .",
    "our general method relies on the fact that the cluster state is simply represented as a projected entangled pair state ( peps ) , also known as a valence - bond solid state .",
    "the peps representation  @xcite is a powerful and often compact method of describing the state of a many - body system .",
    "consider a regular lattice @xmath0 of qubits , with coordination number @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath13 bonds connect each qubit to other sites on the lattice ) .",
    "a pep state on @xmath0 can be constructed by assigning a pair of _ virtual _ quantum systems of dimension @xmath14 to each bond on the lattice , each pair prepared in a maximally - entangled state , and then applying a projection @xmath15 to the @xmath13 virtual systems associated with each site .",
    "the cluster state ( and a wide variety of other states of interest ) require only @xmath16 for their representation ; in what follows , we restrict our attention to this case where the virtual systems are qubits .",
    "in addition , we choose the maximally - entangled state of these virtual qubits to be the two - qubit cluster state @xmath17 where @xmath18 . with this convention",
    ", the cluster state has a simple peps representation  @xcite corresponding to the projection operator @xmath19 at each site , with @xmath13 zeros ( ones ) in @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , and the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 forming a basis for the resulting qubit at each site .    as an example , consider the peps representation of the cluster state on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "there are four bonds emanating from every site in a square lattice , and so each site possesses four virtual qubits .",
    "virtual qubits connected by a bond are placed in the state @xmath24 , and then a projection @xmath25 is applied .",
    "the resultant state , @xmath26 is a cluster state on the square lattice .",
    "the essential idea of the method presented in this paper is to mimic the peps construction procedure using a physical two - body hamiltonian , wherein the `` virtual '' qubits are real physical systems and the resulting peps state is _ encoded _ into logical qubits . consider a regular lattice .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the set of sites , each with coordination number @xmath13 .",
    "we assign @xmath13 qubits to each site , and label with a double index @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "( the choice of the second label @xmath30 is completely arbitrary . )",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the pauli @xmath5 and @xmath6 operators for the @xmath30th qubit at site @xmath28 .",
    "following the peps construction , if a site @xmath7 is connected to a site @xmath9 by a bond ( denoted @xmath33 ) , then we associate qubit @xmath27 and @xmath34 for some @xmath30 to this bond .",
    "( we note that this notation can become problematic with certain periodic conditions , but it should be clear from the context how to adjust it appropriately . )    our _ peps hamiltonian _ is defined as follows .",
    "at each site , we require a two - body hamiltonian with a two - dimensional ground state space spanned by @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for this , we choose a site hamiltonian @xmath37 which is of ising form @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes that qubits @xmath30 and @xmath40 are connected according to some graph structure . aside from being connected , the specific form of this graph is relatively unimportant ; however its structure will affect the energy levels of the hamiltonian .",
    "for example , for two - dimensional lattices , it is natural to choose a ring structure .    between sites ,",
    "we define a different two - body interaction of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the site connected to @xmath7 via bond @xmath30 .",
    "with this hamiltonian , on every bond in the lattice @xmath33 there are two terms : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that the terms in @xmath45 stabilise @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath46 is the ground state of @xmath45 .",
    "this product of maximally - entangled states is the starting point of the peps construction . the site hamiltonian @xmath37 is meant to `` implement '' the peps projection by ensuring that the qubits at a site act as a single logical qubit ; to do so , the site hamiltonian @xmath37 must be much stronger than the bond hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "one is then lead to consider the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath47 where @xmath48 , which is suitable for perturbative analysis in @xmath49 .    in @xcite",
    ", this procedure was applied to a square lattice .",
    "the terms in the perturbation combine at higher orders to yield the stabilisers of the logical cluster state , and the resulting low - energy theory of the lattice is governed by an effective hamiltonian of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : clusterhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the gap to the next excited state is finite and independent of the size of the lattice . of course , because this is a perturbative approach there will now be corrections to the unperturbed logical eigenstates which will not be in the logical space .",
    "so the _ exact _ cluster state will not be obtained .",
    "however , these errors will be small ( occurring with probability @xmath50 , as we will show ) and so a state arbitrarily close to the cluster state can be obtained . in",
    "what follows , this procedure is generalised to other lattice structures important in quantum computation .",
    "we now present a simple duality transformation that maps the hamiltonian   to one describing uncoupled sites .",
    "consider decomposing   as a sum of commuting terms @xmath51 , as @xmath52 where @xmath53 note that @xmath54=0 $ ] for @xmath55 .",
    "define the unitary transformation @xmath56 to be the application of a @xmath57 gate @xmath58 to every bond on the lattice .",
    "the action of this transformation on the bond terms in the above hamiltonian is @xmath59 . transforming each term",
    "@xmath51 thus yields @xmath60 which is localized entirely to the site @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the duality transformation @xmath56 yields a hamiltonian of uncoupled sites , where each site hamiltonian takes the form of a transverse - field ising model on some connected graph .    with this mapping , the spectrum of the hamiltonian   can be calculated explicitly , with the hamiltonian term @xmath61 at each site , for example by using a jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "we note at this point that each hamiltonian @xmath61 has a nondegenerate ground state for all @xmath62 ; thus , our peps hamiltonian on the full lattice will also possess a nondegenerate ground state for @xmath62 .",
    "for each site @xmath7 , define the operator @xmath63 that is , @xmath64 is the tensor product of @xmath65 for every qubit at site @xmath7 together with @xmath66 on every neighbouring site .",
    "it is straightforward to show that all such operators commute with the hamiltonian of eq .  , @xmath67=0\\ , , \\quad \\forall\\ \\mu \\in \\mathcal{l}\\,,\\ ] ] and with each other , @xmath68=0\\ , , \\quad \\forall\\ \\mu,\\nu\\in\\mathcal{l}\\,.\\ ] ] thus , if @xmath69 has a nondegenerate ground state ( as is the case for the peps hamiltonian with @xmath70 )",
    ", it must also be a simultaneous eigenstate of all operators @xmath64 .    using the duality transformation",
    "@xmath56 defined above , we find that @xmath71 using the well - known solution to the transverse - field ising model with hamiltonian  ( [ eq : tfim ] ) , we find that the ground state for @xmath62 is the @xmath1 eigenstate of this operator .",
    "( this can be inferred by the fact that the ground state is clearly the @xmath1 eigenstate of @xmath72 in the limit @xmath73 . )",
    "thus , we have that the ground state of the peps hamiltonian for @xmath62 is the simultaneous @xmath1 eigenstate of all operators @xmath64 , @xmath28 .",
    "the operators @xmath64 , then , can be viewed as _ encoded cluster stabilizers _ , and the ground state for @xmath62 as an encoded cluster state .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath62 , this encoding is no longer in the ground state space of @xmath37 spanned locally at sites by the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "our perspective is to consider the encoding to be fixed in this space and view the ground state of the peps hamiltonian as the desired locally - encoded cluster state plus perturbative corrections in @xmath74 .",
    "these concepts are best illustrated through a simple example .",
    "first we illustrate this approach on the simplest lattice : a one - dimensional line of qubits with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly that the perturbative procedure yields a low - energy effective hamiltonian on the logical qubits of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : clusterhamiltonian ] ) , and that an approximate cluster state is obtained as the non - degenerate ground state . the basic steps outlined in this example for the one - dimensional line , suitably generalized , will be applicable to more complex lattice structures .    consider a one - dimensional line consisting of @xmath75 qubit sites with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. , a ring ) .",

    "the perturbative approach has so far been successful in producing the cluster state on each lattice type with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we now analyse the effect of placing fixed boundaries on the lattice .",

    "the cluster stabilizers for the end sites are given by the product of an @xmath5 operator on the boundary site with a single @xmath6 operator on its sole neighbour .",

    "the energy corrections to @xmath92th order @xmath344 are the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath345 .",
    "furthermore , the eigenstates that are selected by the perturbation to break the degeneracy ( to zeroth order ) are just the eigenvectors of @xmath345 corresponding to each eigenvalue .",
    "note that @xmath338 depends on lower order energy corrections and so each lower order correction must be calculated before proceeding to the higher order corrections . at each stage",
    "we must insist that the @xmath92th order energies differ from the @xmath346th order energies only by an amount @xmath92th order in @xmath45 , which removes any non - physical solutions .    to determine the explicit form of the @xmath338 , we simply substitute eq .",

    "( [ a7 ] ) becomes @xmath348 thus , the first order energy corrections to states in @xmath86 are just the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath349 . in the non - degenerate case we see that eq .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) reduces to the well - known expression @xmath350 .",
    "if this eigenvalue spectrum is still degenerate , then the degeneracy is not completely broken at first order .",
    "it is then necessary to go to second order @xmath351 again we can examine whether the degeneracy has been broken at this stage by examining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the above operator @xmath352 . if not , we must continue to proceed to higher orders .",

    "first , from eq .",
    "( [ a10 ] ) , it can be concluded that @xmath355 are the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath356 for each order @xmath357 .",
    "however , the energies @xmath358 are not generally the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath338 ; this will only be true in general when all operators @xmath338 can be simultaneously diagonalised .",
    "fortunately , for the systems investigated in this paper , it can be shown that the @xmath338 commute with each other and therefore the energies @xmath358 are indeed the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath338 .",
    "second , there are some general properties we can note about the form of the @xmath338 operators . from the form of eq .",
    "( [ a10 ] ) and the series expansion in eq .",
    "( [ a10l ] ) , it is clear that all terms in the expansion of @xmath330 are proportional to operators of the form @xmath359 for some @xmath360 .",
    "this result is used in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalgraph ] .",
    "the above analysis allows the zeroth order energy eigenstates to be determined .",
    "we now direct our attention to the first order corrections to these states .",
    "suppose we have determined that @xmath361 to zeroth order for some @xmath362 using the above method . from eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) and using eqs .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) we have , to first order in @xmath45 , @xmath363 where @xmath147 are the eigenstates of @xmath37 with energy @xmath364 .",
    "determining @xmath365 to first order is somewhat more complicated : even though @xmath366 to zeroth order , it is possible for first order corrections to come from other states @xmath367 .",
    "however , if the energy degeneracy between @xmath368 and @xmath369 is only broken at order @xmath370 , then one must go to the order @xmath371 equations just to determine the _ first _ order eigenstate corrections to @xmath365 .",
    "in this case , @xmath372 but @xmath373 .",
    "then , at order @xmath371 , eq .  ( [ a7 ] ) reads @xmath374 taking the inner product with @xmath369 and rearranging gives latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\langle l |\\psi_i\\rangle_l&=\\frac{\\langle l |\\theta^{(m_l+1 ) } |\\psi_i\\rangle_l -e_i^{(m_l+1)}\\langle l |\\psi_i\\rangle_l}{e_i^{(m_l)}-e_l^{(m_l ) } } \\notag\\\\ & = \\frac{\\langle l |\\theta^{(m_l+1 ) }    @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , to first order in @xmath45 , we have latexmath:[\\[\\begin{gathered } \\label{a19 } |\\psi_i\\rangle =   |i\\rangle + \\sum_{|j\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{h}_{\\bar{l } } } \\frac { \\langle j | v |i\\rangle } { e_l^{(0)}-e_j^{(0)}}|j\\rangle \\\\ + \\sum_{|l\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{h}_l , l \\neq i } \\frac{\\langle l |\\theta^{(m_l+1 ) }"
