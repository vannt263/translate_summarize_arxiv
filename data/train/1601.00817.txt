    "despite the various astrophysical observations in support of its existence  @xcite , the nature of dark matter still remains an open question . of the various candidates for dark matter , one of the most compelling is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp )  @xcite , with a mass ranging from a few gev to @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , when the wimp annihilation rate falls below the hubble expansion rate , the chemical equilibrium between wimps and the primordial plasma is no longer maintained , and the number of wimps per comoving volume naturally fixes to the value required for explaining the present abundance of cold dark matter .",
    "although chemical equilibrium at this stage is no longer maintained , kinetic equilibrium between dark matter and the plasma is still achieved through a high momentum exchange rate  @xcite .",
    "eventually , when the hubble rate equates the scattering process rate , wimps kinetically decouple from the plasma and flow with a given free - streaming velocity .",
    "this velocity sets the lowest value for the size of protohalos , which determines the subsequent evolution of primordial structures  @xcite .",
    "in particular , bringmann  @xcite defined the temperature of the kinetic decoupling @xmath1 in the standard cosmological scenario , while gelmini and gondolo  @xcite defined @xmath1 in the low - temperature reheating ( ltr ) cosmology following a dimensionality reasoning .",
    "we present a full solution of the evolution equation governing the process of the kinetic decoupling , and we generalize the definition of the temperature of kinetic decoupling and the average kinetic energy of wimps in a generic non - standard cosmological model .",
    "the scattering process between plasma at temperature @xmath2 and wimps of mass @xmath3 is a brownian motion in momentum space , with momentum transfer related to the number @xmath4 of collisions required to change the momentum by @xmath5 as @xmath6 . since @xmath7 is much larger than the average momentum transfer @xmath8 , the number of collisions required to appreciably change the momentum of wimp is @xmath9 .",
    "the momentum exchange rate @xmath10 is suppressed with respect to the elastic collision rate @xmath11 by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "thermal decoupling of wimps occurs at a temperature @xmath13 approximatively given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hubble expansion rate at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "thermal decoupling of a heavy dark matter particle with @xmath3 and with small momentum transfer per collision @xmath16 is described by a fokker - planck equation for the dark matter particle occupation number @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a monotonically increasing function with @xmath2 .    defining the wimp kinetic temperature @xmath20 as 2/3 of the average kinetic energy of the dark matter particle , @xmath21 and defining the function @xmath22 the fokker - planck eq .",
