    "square - free monomial ideals are in strong connection to topology and combinatorics . there are at least two approaches to investigate these ideals in terms of topology or combinatorics .",
    "one approach is to associate a simplicial complex to a given square - free monomial ideal @xmath3 , whose faces come from square - free monomials which do not belong to @xmath3 . another approach is to associate a clutter to @xmath3 whose circuits come from the minimal generators of @xmath3 .",
    "the main goal in both cases is to obtain algebraic properties of @xmath3 via combinatorial or topological properties of associated objects .",
    "one of the highlighted result on this subject is frberg s theorem .",
    "r. frberg in @xmath7 showed that , the edge ideal of a graph @xmath8 has a linear resolution if and only if the complement graph @xmath9 is chordal @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a square - free monomial ideal generated in degree @xmath10 , the problem of having linear resolution depends only on the shape of the associated graph , and does not depend on the characteristic of the base field .",
    "this is not the case for square - free monomial ideals generated in degree @xmath11 .",
    "the ideal associated to a triangulation of the projective plane , is a classical example of a square - free monomial ideal generated in degree @xmath12 whose resolution depends on the characteristic of the base field ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) ) .",
    "so it is too much to expect a combinatorial characterization ( as in frberg s theorem ) for arbitrary square - free monomial ideals with linear resolution .",
    "however , it is reasonable to ask , if one may find such a characterization for ( square - free ) monomial ideals with linear resolution over any field .",
    "it is worth to say that , via alexander duality , this problem is equivalent to characterization of all simplicial complexes which are cohen - macaulay over any field ( c.f .",
    "* theorem 3 ) ) . as a partial result on this subject , in @xcite , the authors defined several generalizations of chordality to higher dimensions , and they showed that the ideal associated to their classes , have a linear resolution over any field .",
    "however , it is not so difficult to give a counterexample for the other direction .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite , the authors made the attempt to prove the other direction , by showing that every square - free monomial ideal with linear resolution over any field , comes from a chorded simplicial complex , where in that paper chorded is defined pretty technically .",
    "the authors show by an example that not any ideal admitting a linear resolution over any field , need to be chorded in their sense ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 7.2 ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first we show that , for a given square - free monomial ideal @xmath3 , we may add ( remove ) some generators to ( from ) @xmath3 in a way that , the corresponding non - linear strands do not change under this process . then , motivated by this result , we introduce a class of clutters whose associated ideal of any member of this class has a linear resolution over any field .",
    "the advantage of this definition is that , this class contains other known families of clutters with this property , and at the moment , we do nt know of any counterexample for the other direction ( see question  [ characterization question ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we present the background material .",
    "this involves some preliminaries on graded modules and betti numbers together with some basic notions of combinatorics .",
    "then , in section  [ section stability ] , we state one of the main theorems of this paper ( theorem  [ main ] ) . indeed , with the required preparations , we show that , if @xmath3 is a square - free monomial ideal corresponded to a clutter @xmath13 and @xmath14 is chosen appropriately , then the ideals @xmath15 and @xmath3 share the same betti numbers in their non - linear strands . in section  [ section chordal ] , we introduce the class @xmath16 of chordal clutters . it is shown that , for any member of @xmath16 , the associated ideal has a linear resolution over any field .",
    "then we show that , this class contains other families of chordal clutters as defined in @xcite .",
    "we close the paper by showing that , unlike in the graph case , it is not true that for arbitrary element of @xmath16 , the associated ideal has linear quotients .",
    "a counterexample for the last assertion , comes from a triangulation of the dunce hat .",
