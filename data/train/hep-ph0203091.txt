    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite offers a new approach to the hierarchy problem .",
    "this scheme proposes that our four - dimensional world is embedded in a five - dimensional spacetime described by the metric @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and with the @xmath5 dimensional coordinate @xmath6 being compactified on an @xmath7 orbifold bounded by branes of opposite tension at the fixed points @xmath8 ( known as the planck brane ) and @xmath9 ( tev - brane ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 describes the curvature of the space ( with the five - dimensional curvature invariant being given by @xmath11 ) and is of order the five - dimensional planck scale , @xmath12 , so that no additional hierarchy exists .",
    "self - consistency of the classical theory requires  @xcite that @xmath13 so that quantum gravitational effects can be neglected .",
    "the space between the two branes is @xmath14 and their separation , @xmath15 , can be naturally stabilized  @xcite with @xmath16 ; we employ @xmath17 in the numerical results that follow . for such values of @xmath18",
    "any mass of order the planck scale on the @xmath8 brane appears to be suppressed by an amount @xmath19 on the tev brane .",
    "the presence of the exponential warp factor @xmath20 thus naturally generates the hierarchy between the planck and electroweak ( ew ) scales .",
    "the scale of physics on the tev - brane is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "integration over the extra dimension of the five dimensional rs action yields the relationship between the 4-dimensional planck scale and the scales @xmath10 and @xmath12 : @xmath23 together , this relation and the inequality @xmath24 imply that the ratio @xmath25 can not be too large , and suggests that @xmath26 .",
    "in the original rs framework , gravity propagates freely throughout the bulk while the standard model ( sm ) fields are constrained to the tev - brane .",
    "the graviton kk states have non - trivial wave functions in the extra dimension due to the warp factor , and have masses given by @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 are the unequally spaced roots of the bessel function @xmath29 and @xmath30 labels the kk excitation level .",
    "the first graviton excitation thus naturally has a mass of order a tev .",
    "the @xmath31 kk states couple to fields on the tev - brane with a strength of @xmath32 .",
    "the graviton kk states can thus be produced in colliders as tev - scale resonances with tev@xmath33-size couplings to matter  @xcite .    for additional freedom in model building ,",
    "the original rs model has been extended to allow various subsets of the sm fields to reside in the bulk in the limit that the back - reaction on the metric can be neglected .",
    "this possibility allows for new techniques to address gauge coupling unification , supersymmetry breaking , the neutrino mass spectrum , and the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "placing the gauge fields of the sm alone in the bulk is problematic  @xcite , as all of the gauge kk excitations then have large couplings to the remaining fields on the tev - brane ; these couplings take on the value @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the corresponding sm gauge coupling .",
    "ew precision data then constrain the masses of the first kk gauge states to be in excess of 25 - 30 tev , thus requiring @xmath36 to be in excess of 100 tev  @xcite .",
    "this introduces a new hierarchy between @xmath37 and the ew scale , and therefore this scenario is highly disfavored .",
    "it was subsequently shown that these constraints can be softened by also placing the sm fermions in the bulk @xcite and giving them a common five - dimensional mass @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to further model building possibilities provided @xmath39 is in the range @xmath40  @xcite ; for larger values of @xmath39 the former strong coupling regime is again entered , while for smaller values potential problems with perturbation theory can arise  @xcite . in the absence of fine - tuning , these scenarios require that the higgs field which breaks the symmetry of the sm remains on the tev brane , as when bulk higgs fields are employed , the experimentally observed pattern of @xmath41 and @xmath42 masses can not be reproduced . in this case , the @xmath41 and @xmath42 obtain a common kk mass in addition to the usual contribution from the higgs vev .",
    "it is then impossible to simultaneously maintain the two tree - level sm relationships @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the possibility of allowing the sm fermions to propagate in the rs bulk .",
    "we show that if the third generation of fermions resides in the bulk , then large mixing between the fermion zero modes and their kk tower states is induced by the sm higgs vev and the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "this mixing results in contributions to @xmath45 or @xmath46  @xcite which greatly exceeds the bound set by current precision ew measurements  @xcite .",
    "the only way to circumvent this problem is to raise the mass of the first kk gauge state above 25 tev for any value of @xmath39 in its viable range , which again implies a higher value of @xmath36 .",
    "unless we are willing to fine tune @xmath36 , we must then require the third generation fields to remain on the tev - brane so that they have no kk excitations .",
    "if we treat the three generations symmetrically we must localize all of the fermions on the tev - brane , and also confine the sm gauge sector to the tev brane as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we instead propose here a ` mixed ' scenario which places the first two generations of fermions in the bulk and localizes the third on the wall .",
    "we find that mixing of the kk towers of these lighter generations with their zero modes does not yield a dangerously large value of @xmath45 provided that @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we show that values of @xmath39 near @xmath48 to @xmath49 may help explain the mass hierarchies @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we explore the possible signatures of this scenario at the lhc and future linear colliders , as well as in precision measurements and flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) ; we find that the same parameter space which addresses the fermion mass hierarchies also allows a higgs boson with a mass of 500 gev , and is otherwise invisible at the lhc .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a brief overview of the mechanics of the rs model which we will need for subsequent calculations . in section",
    "iii we examine the contributions to the @xmath0 parameter when the third generation is in the bulk and show that this scenario is highly disfavored .",
    "we examine the present bounds on the kk mass spectrum in our mixed scenario that arise from precision ew data in section iv .",
    "we demonstrate that sm higgs masses as large as 500 gev are now allowed by the electroweak fit since these contributions can be partially ameliorated from those of the kk states .",
    "section v explores the implications of this scenario for the lhc , while section vi examines the signatures at a future  linear collider and at gigaz .",
    "in particular , we show that the kk states in this model lie outside the kinematically limited range of the lhc but yield observable indirect effects at a linear collider .",
    "finally , we discuss constraints from fcnc in section vii , and present our conclusions in section viii .",

    "this , and the fact that the @xmath175 fusion process is higher order in the ew coupling constant , render this a poor place in which to search for kk effects .    the only remaining possibility for detecting the kk states at the lhc is via deviations in top and bottom quark production .",
    "these processes are dominated at high energies by gluon initiated interactions ; however , these do not receive any modifications from gluon kk states since @xmath187 couplings do not exist .",
    "we thus only examine top quark production , which receives a larger contribution from quark initiated processes , and where the large couplings of the kk gauge states to third generation quarks enter .",
    "the invariant mass distribution is presented in fig .  [ topprod ] for @xmath188 tev and @xmath167 .",
    "since the kk couplings to wall fermions do not decrease with kk level , we have checked that the contributions from including multiple states in the kk tower does not significantly enhance the effect .",
    "in fact , summing the first five kk contributions slightly decreases the cross section from that where only the first level is included due to the factor of @xmath189 that enters the coupling of the @xmath30th kk level to top quarks .",

    "we examine here whether kk gauge boson exchanges can be observed at a future @xmath192 collider with @xmath193 gev and @xmath194 . since the anticipated center - of - mass energies are well below the 11 tev kk gauge mass defining the lower edge of the allowed range from the ew fit , we study the off - resonance modification of fermion pair production , @xmath195 .",

    "it is difficult to predict what the status of fits to the ew precision data will be after the gigaz program concludes , as a small shift in the experimental central values assisted by the small anticipated errors can drastically alter the current situation .",
    "if the central values remain unchanged , it is clear from these figures that the improved precision in the measurement of @xmath213 will disfavor the heavier higgs solutions , and require a large value of @xmath217 , which reintroduces a hierarchy between @xmath37 and the ew scale .",
    "however , the rs predictions for @xmath218 and @xmath219 match experiment better than the sm results and can accommodate a heavy higgs , and the global fit to the ew observables may prefer this solution .",
    "whatever scenario is realized , it is certainly true that the entire parameter space , including the region inaccessible in off - resonance fermion pair production , can be probed at gigaz .",
    "the placement of fermions in different locations in extra dimensions , on the tev brane or in the bulk , leads to potentially dangerous fcnc since the glashow - weinberg - paschos conditions  @xcite for the natural absence of fcnc are no longer satisfied .",

    "a detailed analysis of fcnc effects is certainly beyond the scope of this paper and requires a specific flavor model as input ; we simply outline the potential sources of fcnc and provide a few estimates of their size .",
    "the most obvious sources of fcnc are from the exchanges of gauge bosons .",
    "the states in the gauge kk towers can feel the different fermion generation localities , and through intergenerational mixing can then induce fcnc .",
    "furthermore , the couplings of the wall fields to the kk gauge states are enhanced by a factor of @xmath220 . since zero mode kk gauge states in the limit of vanishing mixing",
    "are constrained by construction to have the same couplings to fermions as do the sm gauge bosons , such fields can only induce fcnc through the small admixture of kk weak eigenstates introduced by mixing .",
    "these effects are suppressed by small mixing angles , and are not as important as those arising from the kk towers themselves .",
    "we therefore expect that the kk gauge state contributions represent the greatest source of potentially dangerous fcnc .",
    "graviton kk towers can also probe the different locations of the sm fermion generations and induce fcnc - like couplings . however , in this case the potentially dangerous contributions are much smaller since ( @xmath221 ) graviton - induced fcnc take the form of dimension-8 operators , in contrast to the dimension-6 kk gauge contributions , and lead to amplitudes which are suppressed by factors of order @xmath222 .",
    "this is an enormous degree of suppression since we have shown that @xmath223 tev in the scenario presently under consideration .",

    "we see that , at least for the @xmath254 system , the rs fcnc contributions are rather small . we have also studied @xmath255 mixing and obtain similar results .",
    "once a realistic theory of flavor within this rs model context is constructed , we can perform a more detailed and quantitative analysis of the potential impact of fcnc",
    ". it will be interesting to examine if existing bounds can provide further constraints on the rs model parameters within such a framework .",
    "in this paper we have re - examined the placement of sm fermions in the full 5-dimensional bulk of the randall - sundrum spacetime .",
    "we have found that mixing between the top quark zero mode and its kk tower , induced by the large top quark mass , yields shifts in the @xmath0 parameter that are inconsistent with current measurements . to obviate these bounds",
    "we must take the fundamental rs scale @xmath256 tev , reintroducing the hierarchy between the planck and ew scales and thus destroying the original motivation for the rs model .",
    "we instead proposed a mixed scenario which localizes the third generation of quarks , and presumably leptons , on the tev - brane and allows the lighter two generations to propagate in the rs bulk . for values of the bulk mass parameter in the region",
    "@xmath257 , the same values allowed by both contact interaction searches and @xmath0 parameter constraints arising from the first two generations , the fermions mass hierarchies @xmath1 and @xmath2 are naturally reproduced .    we next explored the consequences of this proposal for current precision ew measurements .",
    "we studied modifications of the electroweak observables caused by both mixing of the sm gauge bosons with their corresponding kk towers and the exchanges of higher kk states ; we found that with kk masses @xmath258 tev and bulk mass parameters @xmath259 a higgs boson with mass @xmath260 gev can provide a good fit to the precision electroweak data .",
    "an analysis of the fit showed that the large couplings between the zero mode bottom quark and kk gauge bosons induced large shifts in @xmath213 that prevented a heavier higgs from being consistent with the precision data .",
    "we then examined the signatures of this scenario at future high energy colliders .",
    "we found that the parameter region consistent with the precision electroweak data does not lead to any new physics signatures at the lhc ; the expected event excess in both drell - yan and gauge boson fusion processes are statistically insignificant with the envisioned integrated luminosities , and the predicted modification of the @xmath261 production cross section is similarly unobservably small .",
    "the only new physics that the lhc would possibly observe is a higgs boson apparently heavier than that allowed by the sm electroweak fits .",
    "by contrast , the parameter range @xmath262 tev and @xmath263 can be probed in fermion pair production processes at a future @xmath192 collider with center - of - mass energy of @xmath264 gev , while the region @xmath265 tev and @xmath263 is testable at gigaz . for larger kk first excitation masses , we reintroduce the hierarchy between @xmath37 and the electroweak scale .    finally , we considered the possible constraints on this scenario arising from low energy fcnc .",
    "the asymmetric treatment of the three fermion generations allows kk @xmath42-boson exchanges to mediate fcnc interactions .",
    "we estimated the contributions of such effects to meson - antimeson mixing , and found that their size is within the theoretical errors inherent to meson mixing .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of fcnc effects requires a full model of flavor , which we have not constructed .    in summary",
    ", we have found that the experimental restrictions on placing sm matter in the rs bulk lead naturally to a very interesting region of parameter space .",
    "this parameter region provides a geometrical origin for the fermion yukawa hierarchies , and allows a heavy higgs boson to be consistent with precision measurements while remaining otherwise invisible at the lhc .",
    "we believe that such features render this model worthy of further study .",
