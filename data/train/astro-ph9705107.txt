    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) makes a clean prediction for the primordial helium abundance @xmath0 , depending on only one parameter ( the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath3 ) and on that only weakly .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath0 is therefore necessary to test bbn even in the present situation where measurements of other predicted quantities constraining @xmath3 , such as the primordial lithium abundance , deuterium abundance and the cosmic baryon density , are not yet so precise ( e.g. walker 1991 , smith 1993 , sarkar 1996 , fields 1996 , hogan 1997ab ) .",
    "even though the bulk of the helium of the universe originates in the big bang , the additional helium enrichment by stars can not be ignored in estimating the primordial abundance from observations of present - day helium . unlike the case of deuterium",
    ", we do not have the option of measuring directly the nearly primordial abundance of 4 at high redshift .",
    "lyman-@xmath4 absorption by he@xmath5 at high redshift now gives a rough direct estimate of primordial abundance ( hogan , anderson & rugers 1997 ) , but require uncertain ionization corrections to estimate @xmath2 .",
    "the high precision needed for strong cosmological tests can only be attained with high signal - to - noise measurements of nebular emission lines in well characterized nearby regions ( pagel 1992 , izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky , 1994 , 1997 , skillman 1994 , 1997 ) , necessarily requiring measurements in gas with a certain amount of stellar helium superimposed on the primordial helium .    under these circumstances , what is the best way to estimate the primordial helium abundance @xmath0 ?",
    "it certainly helps to find regions with as little stellar helium as possible , as indicated both by their helium abundances and by the abundances of other heavier elements .",
    "the best studied example is i zw 18 ( pagel 1992 , skillman & kennicutt 1993 , izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky , 1997 ) , with an average estimated helium abundance from five independent measurements @xmath6 ( olive , skillman , & steigman 1997 ) , and a metallicity 1/50th of solar . in the analysis",
    "below , we will use samples drawn from the complete sample of 62 individual regions ( including two in i zw 18 ) compiled by olive , skillman , & steigman ( 1997 ) from the data in pagel ( 1992 ) , izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky , ( 1994 , 1996 ) , and skillman ( 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "this sample represents all published @xmath2 measurements of regions with o / h @xmath7 and n / h @xmath8 ( for comparison ( o / h)@xmath9 and ( n / h)@xmath10 ) .    one statistical technique to extract a primordial helium abundance from such a sample was introduced by peimbert & torres - peimbert ( 1974 ) and is still widely used . for each galaxy in the sample , a metallicity @xmath11 ( either o / h or n / h ) and helium abundance @xmath2 are measured ; one then fits a linear relation between @xmath2 and @xmath11 and extrapolates to zero metallicity to find the primordial value .",
    "this technique offers insights into the nuclear evolution of these systems , and for relatively large enrichments the extrapolation is empirically well founded . in olive , steigman & walker ( 1991 ) and in olive & steigman ( 1995 ) , it was shown that these two quantities as measured in extragalactic regions are in fact strongly correlated .",
    "the stability of the resulting fits was tested by a statistical bootstrap in olive & scully ( 1996 ) and in olive , skillman , & steigman ( 1997 ) showing that the results were not particularly sensitive to any individual data point .    however , one of the limitations of this method is the need to assume a linear relation between @xmath2 and @xmath11 , which is not well motivated .",
    "for example , helium and oxygen are not produced in the same stars ; while helium is produced primarily in intermediate mass stars , oxygen is produced only in stars with masses @xmath12 .",
    "physically realistic enrichment models often include quadratic terms , as well as stochastic variations in enrichment history , including different slopes @xmath13 .",
    "it is not clear that complicating the fits to include such effects results in a value for primordial @xmath0 with any greater statistical significance or reliability .",
    "moreover most of the information on the primordial abundance is contained in the lowest metallicity points , where the correlation is not very reliably established ; this information is not being efficiently used in regression fits dominated by highly enriched regions .",
    "another approach has been to simply take the lowest , best measured points and use them as estimates of ( or at least limits on ) the primordial abundance .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that it may be sufficient to determine the primordial 4 abundance from even a single well studied low metallicity region such as i zw 18 ( kunth 1994 ) , although to avoid bias it should be chosen on the basis of low metallicity and not low helium abundance .",
    "although these approaches yield results consistent with the linear fit to the data , caution is needed to avoid subtle biases if one starts off by selecting a sample by intentionally choosing the lowest points . moreover in a sample of more than just one point we need a statistical method to combine the data , which recognizes the real spread in stellar helium enrichment and still recovers an unbiased estimate of the primordial value in spite of the obvious `` bias '' that the nonprimordial contributions are always additive .",
    "we explore here a simple but systematic bayesian approach to these issues , which we believe is the simplest recipe to extract an unbiased primordial abundance estimate from the data , free from detailed assumptions about metal enrichment .",
    "we aim to assume as little as possible only that there is some universal primordial helium abundance , and that all subsequent evolution has increased the abundance .",
    "we encapsulate these assumptions mathematically with a bayesian `` prior '' and derive statistical constraints on the primordial abundance which explicitly recognize the bias introduced by stellar enrichment .",
    "inspiration for our approach and more background on the statistical methods is given by press ( 1996 ) application of bayesian arguments to estimates of the hubble constant .",
    "suppose we have a sample @xmath14 consisting of a series of abundance measurements @xmath15 in a set of galaxies . in each case",
    "@xmath16 there is some true abundance @xmath17 which we do not measure , because of the measurement error .",
    "we seek to evaluate the relative probability ( or likelihood ) of obtaining the data in sample @xmath14 , given a primordial abundance @xmath0 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the probability of obtaining the measurement @xmath15 given the primordial value @xmath0 . for this in turn",
    "we write @xmath20 the first term in the integrand is just the distribution of measurement errors in each case . for the second term we need to explicitly construct a bayesian prior @xmath21 .",
    "this `` enrichment probability function '' encodes our assumptions about what the distribution of helium abundances in galaxies in our sample ought to be , given a primordial abundance .    what do we know about @xmath21 ?",
    "the most important property , supported by all models of nuclear evolution , is that there is no net destruction of helium : stars can only increase the primordial abundance .",
    "thus nowhere can the true abundance be less than @xmath0 : @xmath22 for @xmath23 . at a more detailed level",
    ", the shape of this prior depends on what we think about the chemical histories of the galaxies in the sample under study ; there will be some range of @xmath0 of width @xmath24 for which @xmath25 .",
    "fortunately as we shall demonstrate , within reasonable limits the detailed shape for @xmath26 does not much affect the statistical limits on @xmath0 : the most important thing is its asymmetry about @xmath27 .    within this framework",
    "we can now explore estimates of @xmath28 , and consequent statistical constraints on @xmath0 . to start with , ( 1 ) assume that the observational errors are normally distributed with variances @xmath29 , and ( 2 ) assume the simplest form for @xmath21 , a uniform distribution or top - hat function of width @xmath24 , @xmath30 . the likelihood function is then given by @xmath31 where the product is over the @xmath32 sample data points .",
    "the integral in ( [ prob1 ] ) can be performed analytically , resulting in @xmath33 the normalization constants @xmath34 are chosen so that each of the individual functions @xmath35 , when integrated over @xmath0 , yield unity . to a very good approximation , @xmath36 . for sufficiently large @xmath24 , the first error function is approximately unity .    we choose to leave @xmath24 as a free parameter and maximize the likelihood ( [ prob2 ] ) in both @xmath0 and @xmath24 that is , we estimate @xmath24 from the sample itself . for each choice of @xmath37",
    "we compute the likelihood @xmath38 ; the maximum of the likelihood gives the best values of these parameters .",
    "the relative likelihood of other choices then allow us to derive constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath24 .",
    "this can be illustrated in contour plots showing the equal likelihood contours representing 1 , 2 and 3 standard deviations .",
    "these are determined by comparing the log of the likelihood to its peak value = _ peak - s^2/2 [ s ] for @xmath39 standard deviations .",
    "the contours in the figures represent 1 , 2 , and 3 standard deviations from the peak value as determined by ( [ s ] ) .",
    "if a large number of points contribute , the @xmath40 contour translates in the usual way to approximately 95% confidence .    as an illustrative exercise it is useful first to consider a sample of just one galaxy , the lowest metallicity galaxy i zw 18 where @xmath2 has been measured independently in two distinct regions , yielding an average helium abundance @xmath41 .",
    "because the measured values of @xmath0 for the two regions in i zw 18 are consistent with each other , the likelihood function ( [ prob2 ] ) is peaked at @xmath42 and prefers a value @xmath43 , equal to the average of the two points ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "the full power of the method becomes clearer when we employ a larger statistical sample . in figures 1b-1e",
    ", we show the effect of progressively adding more 4 data to our sample .",
    "the data is ordered by metallicity so that for example , the 11 point set includes the 11 extragalactic regions with the lowest values of o / h . except for sample selection ,",
    "the oxygen abundance is not explicitly utilized .",
    "we show the likelihood distributions up to what was described olive , skillman , and steigman ( 1997 ) as set c corresponding to 32 data points . in this case , the linear extrapolation with respect to o / h gave @xmath44 .",
    "the cuttoffs for the various data sets considered here correspond to o / h @xmath4535 , 45 , 60 , and 85 @xmath46 for the 7 , 11 , 18 , and 32 point sets respectively . , the correlation between @xmath2 and o / h can not be neglected . even in the 32 point set considered here ,",
    "the correlation is statistically significant .",
    "notice in table 1 that the likely value of @xmath24 increases from the 18 to the 32 point set ; larger samples contain more information on enrichment but obscure the information on @xmath0 . ]",
    "as soon as one goes beyond a 2-point data set , the dispersion in the data ( normally associated with enrichment correlated with metallicity ) produces a likelihood distribution which is peaked at a non - zero value for @xmath24 yielding an estimate of the stellar helium enrichment of the sample .",
    "consider for example the 11-point data set .",
    "the peak of the distribution occurs at @xmath47 and at that width , @xmath48 .",
    "the individual helium abundances in this sample range from 0.225 to 0.251 , with a weighted mean 0.237 @xmath49 0.002 .",
    "the value for @xmath0 determined by the likelihood distribution is significantly below the mean value of the data .",
    "this bias is familiar from studies of the malmquist effect : the best estimate of the distribution from which points are drawn is in general quite different from the distribution of the values for the points themselves . in the present context",
    "it is the asymmetry of the prior which leads to the apparent bias .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the 2@xmath50 level , the data are consistent with a single primordial value with no subsequent enrichment @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to a conservative 2@xmath50 upper limit , @xmath52 as the number of data points in the sample increases , the peak of the likelihood distribution shifts to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "the 2@xmath50 upper limit however remains at @xmath42 , and its value is relatively insensitive to the data set .",
    "these results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the most important arbitrary step in the above analysis is in the choice of prior , and to calibrate its effect we consider a range of physically plausible possibilities .",
    "in fact the top - hat function is already quite conservative towards allowing the largest possible upper limits on @xmath0 that is , since very low @xmath2 systems in the present universe , even in the current samples of low metal galaxies , are quite rare , it appears that stellar helium enrichment is seldom very small .",
    "we could however try to bias the result by choosing a different shape biased _ a priori _ towards smaller ( or larger ) nonprimordial enrichments .",
    "consider for example a sawtooth function prior , @xmath53 for @xmath17 between @xmath0 and @xmath54 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this stipulates _ a priori _ that it is most likely that there has been very little helium enrichment , and no enrichment greater than @xmath24 , thus @xmath55 rises abruptly to some value at @xmath27 , linearly decreasing for @xmath56 , and zero for @xmath57 .",
    "we will refer to this prior as the negative bias ( named for the slope with respect to @xmath17 ) .",
    "alternatively , we might choose @xmath58 for @xmath17 between @xmath0 and @xmath54 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this assigns a greater probability for larger helium enrichment but still no enrichment greater than @xmath24 ; thus @xmath55 rises linearly from @xmath0 to some value at @xmath59 .",
    "this is indeed the case for typical galaxy samples , where low enrichment systems are hard to find , so this is perhaps the more realistic prior .",
    "we refer to this prior as the positive bias . taken together , these priors span the range of reasonable possibilities .",
    "likelihood contours for these two additional choices for priors are shown in figures 2 and 3 for the same subsamples discussed above .",
    "for all three priors , and for all the samples considered , the goodness of fit of the model the effective reduced @xmath60 is less than unity , reflecting that the model is an adequate description of the data ( and that the random observational errors have typically been overestimated . )",
    "the differences in the parameter estimates from the top - hat case are small , reflecting the fact that the most critical assumption affecting the results is the one we are most confident in , namely the assignment of @xmath61 for @xmath62 . as is evident from the figures , the likelihood contours",
    "are shifted to the right for the negative bias prior , yielding a higher value for @xmath0 and to the left for the positive bias , favoring a lower @xmath0 .",
    "however , the @xmath63 upper limit is found to be nearly independent of our choice of prior .",
    "these results are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the significant detection of nonzero @xmath24 reveals that even in these samples of metal - poor galaxies , there is evidence for a spread in @xmath2 produced by stars .",
    "the best fit to the data is for values of the primordial abundance in the range @xmath64 , depending on the specific model and subsample .",
    "a 2@xmath50 upper limit , @xmath65 , holds for all cases ; this bound is virtually independent of the stellar helium enrichment model .",
    "there are enough data points entering so that even if individual errors are nongaussian , this limit corresponds approximately to a 95% confidence level .",
    "the statistical evidence from this sample indicates that the internally estimated errors are if anything overly conservative , so the quoted limits are also generously estimated .",
    "the only reasonable way to reconcile the data with a higher value of @xmath0 would be some systematic error in common among all the points that is , an in - common mistake biasing the results of all the measurements .",
    "of course , errors of this kind can not be corrected by any purely statistical technique .",
    "even with quite simple and conservative assumptions , our analysis yields a final limit which is sufficiently precise to overconstrain the big bang picture when combined with other data .",
    "our limit of @xmath65 corresponds to a limit on the baryon / photon ratio @xmath66 and a predicted deuterium abundance @xmath67 , in conflict with some recent claims ( e.g. tytler 1996 ) but in accord with others ( e.g. songaila 1996 ) .",
    "it is also consistent with bbn predictions of the li abundance ( fields & olive 1996 , fields 1996 ) .",
    "for the observed microwave background temperature , the baryon density is predicted to be @xmath68 , which begins to conflict with some recent estimates based on models of quasar lyman-@xmath4 absorption ( e.g. , rauch 1997 , weinberg 1997 ) , but accords with other estimates of baryon density ( e.g. , hogan 1997ab ) .",
    "an overall concordance of the big bang picture is certainly possible but will depend on which of these datasets `` gives way '' .",
    "it is clear that the reliability of @xmath0 estimates would improve significantly with comprehensive studies of even one more region similar to i zw 18 .",
    "we would like to thank e. skillman and g. steigman for helpful conversations .",
    "we are grateful to the institute for nuclear theory , seattle , funded by doe , for sponsoring the 1996 workshop on nucleosynthesis in the big bang , stars , and supernovae , where this work was started .",
