    "in this note , we consider the strong decays of the lowest - lying radially excited baryons .",
    "these are the states comprising the first excited * 56 * -plet , in su(6 ) language .",
    "we make predictions for the decay widths of these states that are independent of any specific model for the binding potential or spatial wave functions .",
    "a reason for taking up studies of excited baryons now is that we anticipate new results from the clas collaboration at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility .",
    "not all the states in the radially excited * 56 * -plet are yet discovered , and many of the measured decay widths of the observed states have large uncertainties . a set of predictions for the decay widths of unobserved states will be of great use to experimenters . of necessity , we also provide predictions for the masses of the unobserved states . to this end",
    ", we present a derivation of the grsey - radicati mass formula  @xcite from large-@xmath0 qcd that we believe has not appeared explicitly in the literature .",
    "another and more specific reason for our analysis is to shed light on the roper resonance , the @xmath1 .",
    "the roper is the first excitation of the nucleon with the same @xmath2 quantum numbers .",
    "the most direct explanation of the roper is as a three - quark radially excited state .",
    "however , certain of its apparent peculiarities have led to plausible suggestions that it may be a hybrid state  @xcite ( a state whose lowest significant fock component is three quarks plus gluonic excitations ) or that it may be a cross section enhancement that does not correspond to any resonance  @xcite . an argument against interpreting the roper as a three - quark state has been that its calculated mass is too high in quark models with one - gluon - exchange , _",
    "i.e. _ spin - color , interactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that the observed mass is perfectly consistent with the three - quark picture if mass splittings are due to spin - flavor interactions instead  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is evidence of a roper signal from a lattice calculation using a three - quark source operator , although uncertainties in the mass determination as yet preclude saying if it is lighter than its negative parity counterpart  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we assume the roper resonance is a three - quark state embedded in the excited * 56 * -plet ; confirmation of the decay widths predicted here will therefore support the three - quark interpretation of this state .",
    "the value of a model - independent analysis should be clear : we are free of any assumptions regarding the binding potential or quark spatial wave functions .",
    "we do make assumptions about the dominance of single - quark operators and about configuration mixing that we now consider in turn .",
    "first , we assume that the decays of interest proceed via a single quark interaction vertex .",
    "we may write the decay operator in the same su(6 ) tensor product space in which we define the baryon spin - flavor wave functions : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is an su(6 ) generator , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the generators of su(2 ) and su(3 ) , respectively , @xmath7 is the meson three - momentum , and @xmath8 represents a meson field operator .",
    "the asterisk in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) indicates that that the operator acts on the spin - flavor wave function of the excited quark .",
    "here we adopt a convenient picture of the baryon state that follows from large-@xmath0 qcd , namely , that the baryon consists of a ` core ' of @xmath9 ground state quarks generating a collective potential in which a single quark is excited .",
    "note that the complete symmetry of the * 56 * -plet spatial wave functions implies that matrix elements of the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) are proportional to matrix elements of the same spin - flavor operator summed over all the quarks in the baryon state , @xmath10 thus , the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) works equally well in parameterizing the decays of radially excited baryons for @xmath11 , where the state may be described more realistically as a collective excitation of all three quarks .",
    "matrix elements of this operator may be written @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a function that parameterizes the momentum dependence of the amplitude .",
    "this includes momentum dependence that originates from the underlying quark - level vertex , as well as from the overlap of the baryon spatial wave functions .",
    "the baryon states shown represent only the spin - flavor part of the wave function , and are nonrelativistically normalized .",
    "use of the single - body decay approximation is strongly motivated by its success in describing decays of the orbitally excited , * 70 * -plet baryons , both in the algebraic su(6 ) approach  @xcite , as well as more recent large-@xmath0 effective field theory analyses  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "both one- and two - body operators have been shown to contribute to * 70 * -plet decay matrix elements at leading order in the @xmath15 expansion .",
    "nonetheless , comparison to data for both strong decays  @xcite and photoproduction amplitudes  @xcite reveals that the two - body operators are phenomenologically irrelevant .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume that similar dynamics may play a role in the strong decays of other excited su(6 ) multiplets .",
    "our second assumption is that mixing between states in the excited * 56 * -plet and other su(6 ) multiplets , _",
    "i.e. _ configuration mixing , can be neglected . in the case of the * 70 * -plet ,",
    "successful large-@xmath0 effective theory descriptions of the strong decays  @xcite , photoproduction amplitudes  @xcite , and the nonstrange mass spectrum  @xcite all neglect mixing with other su(6 ) multiplets . in the present case , one might worry that the nearest observed states with appropriate quantum numbers for mixing , members of the positive - parity * 70 * -plet , are only between 200 and 300 mev heavier than the states of interest , so that a significant effect can not be precluded .",
    "fortunately , evidence from explicit quark models suggests that configuration mixing involving the excited * 56 * is also small  @xcite , and even smaller than one would expect from @xmath15 arguments  @xcite . we simply adopt this as a working assumption , without wedding ourselves to a particular quark model or choice of baryon spatial wave function .",
    "we first determine the functional form and normalization of @xmath14 by considering the decay modes of observed members of the excited * 56 * -plet , the @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the @xmath18 .",
    "we will refer to this multiplet as the * 56@xmath19 * henceforth .",
    "( the rpp refers to the * 56@xmath19 * as the @xmath20 . )",
    "our input values are shown in table  [ table1 ] , and have been extracted from data in the review of particle physics ( rpp )  @xcite .",
    "the one standard deviation errors on the baryon masses were taken to be half of the corresponding mass ranges given in the rpp , and partial widths were computed using the quoted full widths , branching fractions , and associated errors .",
    "the values for @xmath14 corresponding to each observed decay mode are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "since we wish to model the function @xmath14 for momenta from @xmath21 to @xmath22  mev , we require only that we find a simple functional form that works well within this range .",
    "the most successful result is @xmath23 , which has a @xmath24 per degree of freedom of @xmath25 .",
    "note that the functional forms @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 lead to a @xmath24 per degree of freedom of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that such a simple functional form can account for the data in the momentum range of interest , though admittedly , the experimental uncertainties are large .",
    "it is not inconceivable , for example , that improvement in the data could lead to a preference for the less singular - looking linear fit , but given the present errors , the difference between a linear and the @xmath32 fit makes little difference in our decay predictions . continuing in our spirit of model independence , we do not try to ascertain the origin of @xmath14 , but explore how far we can go in predicting decay modes for unobserved states .",
    "we use the grsey - radicati ( gr ) formula to predict masses for the unobserved members of the * 56 * -plet : @xmath33+dj(j+1 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : grf}\\ ] ] here j ( i ) is the baryon spin ( isospin ) and @xmath34 is the number of valence strange quarks .",
    "the gr formula predicts spin- and flavor - dependent mass splitting for completely symmetric su(6 ) baryon multiplets in terms of the four parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; in our case , these parameters are determined from the masses given in table  [ table1 ] . while the gr formula was originally a conjecture  @xcite , and later ` derived ' by assuming su(6 ) symmetry and a specific set of mass operators transforming in symmetry - breaking representations of small dimensionality  @xcite , we begin by showing how eq .",
    "( [ eq : grf ] ) may be obtained more rigorously from large-@xmath0 qcd . this observation follows from the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is not presented there explicitly . in a large-@xmath0 operator analysis for the * 56 * -plet , we may write the general mass formula @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the spin , flavor , and spin - flavor generators of su(6 ) ( with a sum over quarks left implicit ) , and @xmath43 parameterizes the size of su(3 ) breaking .",
    "notice that the eight order - one coefficients , @xmath44 , completely span the space of observables , namely the eight baryon mass eigenvalues . assuming that the baryon states have spin , isospin , and strangeness of order one in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", we may discard all but the first four terms if we choose to work only up to subleading order . acting on a large-@xmath0 baryon state @xmath45 @xmath46 and for totally - symmetric spin - flavor wave functions @xmath47.\\ ] ] these identities imply that the only effects of the discarded terms up through order @xmath15 are redefinitions of the first four coefficients , @xmath48 .",
    "thus we may write the mass eigenvalues @xmath49 & + & \\epsilon \\frac{a'_4}{2\\sqrt{12}n_c } \\left[3i(i+1)-s(s+1)-3n_s(n_s+2)/4\\right ] + { \\cal o}(1/n_c^2 ) \\,\\,\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : grf ] ) then follows from a trivial redefinition of the coefficients . in modern language , the su(6 ) breaking representations that lead to the gr mass formula are precisely those that arise at leading and subleading order in the @xmath15 expansion ."
