    "naturally - occurring collaborative dialogues are very rarely , if ever , one - sided . instead ,",
    "initiative of the interaction shifts among participants in a primarily principled fashion , signaled by features such as linguistic cues , prosodic cues and , in face - to - face interactions , eye gaze and gestures .",
    "thus , for a dialogue system to interact with its user in a natural and coherent manner , it must recognize the user s cues for initiative shifts and provide appropriate cues in its responses to user utterances .",
    "previous work on mixed - initiative dialogues focused on tracking a single thread of control among participants .",
    "we argue that this view of initiative fails to distinguish between _ task initiative _ and _ dialogue initiative _ , which together determine when and how an agent will address an issue .",
    "although physical cues , such as gestures and eye gaze , play an important role in coordinating initiative shifts in face - to - face interactions , a great deal of information regarding initiative shifts can be extracted from utterances based on linguistic and domain knowledge alone . by taking into account such cues during dialogue interactions ,",
    "the system is better able to determine the task and dialogue initiative holders for each turn and to tailor its response to user utterances accordingly .    in this paper , we show how distinguishing between task and dialogue initiatives accounts for phenomena in collaborative dialogues that previous models were unable to explain . we show that a set of cues , which can be recognized based on linguistic and domain knowledge alone , can be utilized by a model for tracking initiative to predict the task and dialogue initiative holders with 99.1% and 87.8% accuracies , respectively , in collaborative planning dialogues .",
    "furthermore , application of our model to dialogues in various other collaborative environments consistently increases the accuracies in the prediction of task and dialogue initiative holders by 2 - 4 and 8 - 13 percentage points , respectively , compared to a simple prediction method without the use of cues , thus illustrating the generality of our model .",
    "previous work on mixed - initiative dialogues focused on tracking and allocating a single thread of control , the _ conversational lead _ , among participants .",
    "novick developed a computational model that utilizes _ meta - locutionary acts _ , such as _ repeat _ and _ give - turn _ , to capture mixed - initiative behavior in dialogues .",
    "whittaker and stenton devised rules for allocating dialogue control based on utterance types , and walker and whittaker utilized these rules for an analytical study on discourse segmentation .",
    "kitano and van ess - dykema developed a plan - based dialogue understanding model that tracks the conversational initiative based on the domain and discourse plans behind the utterances .",
    "smith and hipp developed a dialogue system that varies its responses to user utterances based on four dialogue modes which model different levels of initiative exhibited by dialogue participants .",
    "however , the dialogue mode is determined at the outset and can not be changed during the dialogue .",
    "guinn subsequently developed a system that allows change in the level of initiative based on initiative - changing utterances and each agent s competency in completing the current subtask .",
    "however , we contend that merely maintaining the conversational lead is insufficient for modeling complex behavior commonly found in naturally - occurring collaborative dialogues @xcite . for instance , consider the alternative responses in utterances ( [ smith])-([other ] ) , given by an advisor to a student s question :    _ _    i want to take nlp to satisfy my seminar course requirement .    [ nlp ] who is teaching nlp ?    [ smith ] dr .  smith is teaching nlp .",
    "[ ca nt ] you ca nt take nlp because you havent taken ai , which is a prerequisite for nlp .",
    "[ other ] you ca nt take nlp because you havent taken ai , which is a prerequisite for nlp .",
    "you should take distributed programming to satisfy your requirement , and sign up as a listener for nlp .",
    "suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control , such as that of @xcite . in utterance ( [ smith ] )",
    ", a directly responds to s s question ; thus the conversational lead remains with s. on the other hand , in ( [ ca nt ] ) and ( [ other ] ) , a takes the lead by initiating a subdialogue to correct s s invalid proposal .",
    "however , existing models can not explain the difference in the two responses , namely that in ( [ other ] ) , a actively participates in the planning process by explicitly proposing domain actions , whereas in ( [ ca nt ] ) , she merely conveys the invalidity of s s proposal .",
    "based on this observation , we argue that it is necessary to distinguish between _ task initiative _ , which tracks the lead in the development of the agents plan , and _ dialogue initiative _ , which tracks the lead in determining the current discourse focus @xcite .",
    "this distinction then allows us to explain a s behavior from a response generation point of view : in ( [ ca nt ] ) , a responds to s s proposal by merely taking over the dialogue initiative , i.e. , informing s of the invalidity of the proposal , while in ( [ other ] ) , a responds by taking over both the task and dialogue initiatives , i.e. , informing s of the invalidity and suggesting a possible remedy .",
    "= -1000 an agent is said to have the _ task initiative _ if she is directing how the agents task should be accomplished , i.e. , if her utterances directly propose _ actions _ that the agents should perform .",
    "the utterances may propose _ domain _ actions @xcite that directly contribute to achieving the agents goal , such as _ `` let s send engine e2 to corning . '' _ on the other hand , they may propose _ problem - solving _",
    "actions @xcite that contribute not directly to the agents domain goal , but to how they would go about achieving this goal , such as _ `` let s look at the first [ problem ] first . ''",
    "_ an agent is said to have the _ dialogue initiative _ if she takes the conversational lead in order to establish mutual beliefs , such as mutual beliefs about a piece of domain knowledge or about the validity of a proposal , between the agents .",
    "for instance , in responding to agent a s proposal of sending a boxcar to corning via dansville , agent b may take over the dialogue initiative ( but not the task initiative ) by saying `` _ we ca nt go by dansville because we ve got engine 1 going on that track .",
    "_ '' thus , when an agent takes over the task initiative , she also takes over the dialogue initiative , since a proposal of actions can be viewed as an attempt to establish the mutual belief that a set of actions be adopted . on the other hand ,",
    "an agent may take over the dialogue initiative but not the task initiative , as in ( [ ca nt ] ) above .      to analyze the distribution of task / dialogue initiatives in collaborative planning dialogues",
    ", we annotated the trains91 dialogues @xcite as follows :",
    "each dialogue turn is given two labels , _ task initiative ( ti ) _ and _ dialogue initiative ( di ) _ , each of which can be assigned one of two values , _ system _ or _ manager _ , depending on which agent holds the task / dialogue initiative during that turn . ) . ]",
    ".distribution of task and dialogue initiatives [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ' '' ''    = -1000 table  [ domains ] shows a comparison between the dialogues from the five corpora and the results of this evaluation .",
    "row 1 in the table shows the number of turns where the _ expert _ holds the task / dialogue initiative , with percentages shown in parentheses .",
    "this analysis shows that the distribution of initiatives varies quite significantly across corpora , with the distribution biased toward one agent in the trains and maptask corpora , and split fairly evenly in the airline and switchboard dialogues .",
    "row 2 shows the results of applying our baseline prediction method to the various corpora .",
    "the numbers shown are correct predictions in each instance , with the corresponding percentages shown in parentheses .",
    "these results indicate the difficulty of the prediction problem in each corpus that the task / dialogue initiative distribution ( row 1 ) fails to convey .",
    "for instance , although the dialogue initiative is distributed approximately 30/70% between the two agents in the trains91 corpus and 40/60% in the airline dialogues , the prediction rates in row 2 shows that in both cases , the distribution is the result of shifts in dialogue initiative in approximately 25% of the dialogue turns .",
    "row 3 in the table shows the prediction results when applying our training algorithm using the _ constant - increment - with - counter _ method .",
    "finally , the last row shows the improvement in percentage points between our prediction method and the baseline prediction method . to test the statistical significance of the differences between the results obtained by the two prediction algorithms , for each corpus",
    ", we applied cochran s @xmath0 test @xcite to the results in rows 2 and 3 .",
    "the tests show that for all corpora , the differences between the two algorithms when predicting the task and dialogue initiative holders are statistically significant at the levels of p@xmath10.05 and p@xmath2 , respectively .    based on the results of our evaluation",
    ", we make the following observations .",
    "first , table  [ domains ] illustrates the generality of our prediction mechanism .",
    "although the system s performance varies across environments , the use of cues consistently improves the system s accuracies in predicting the task and dialogue initiative holders by 2 - 4 percentage points ( with the exception of the maptask corpus in which there is no room for improvement ) and 8 - 13 percentage points , respectively .",
    "second , table  [ domains ] shows the specificity of the trained bpa s with respect to application environments . using our prediction mechanism ,",
    "the system s performances on the collaborative planning dialogues ( trains91 , trains93 , and airline reservation ) most closely resemble one another ( last row in table ) .",
    "this suggests that the bpa s may be somewhat sensitive to application environments since they may affect how agents interpret cues .",
    "third , our prediction mechanism yields better results on task - oriented dialogues .",
    "this is because such dialogues are constrained by the goals ; therefore , there are fewer digressions and offers of unsolicited opinion as compared to the switchboard corpus .",
    "this paper discussed a model for tracking initiative between participants in mixed - initiative dialogue interactions .",
    "we showed that distinguishing between task and dialogue initiatives allows us to model phenomena in collaborative dialogues that existing systems are unable to explain .",
    "we presented eight types of cues that affect initiative shifts in dialogues , and showed how our model predicts initiative shifts based on the current initiative holders and and the effects that observed cues have on changing them .",
    "our experiments show that by utilizing the _ constant - increment - with - counter _ adjustment method in determining the basic probability assignments for each cue , the system can correctly predict the task and dialogue initiative holders 99.1% and 87.8% of the time , respectively , in the trains91 corpus , compared to 96.8% and 74.9% without the use of cues .",
    "the differences between these results are shown to be statistically significant using cochran s q test .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated the generality of our model by applying it to dialogues in different application environments .",
    "the results indicate that although the basic probability assignments may be sensitive to application environments , the use of cues in the prediction process significantly improves the system s performance .",
    "we would like to thank lyn walker , diane litman , bob carpenter , and christer samuelsson for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper , bob carpenter and christer samuelsson for participating in the coding reliability test , as well as jan van santen and lyn walker for discussions on statistical testing methods .",
