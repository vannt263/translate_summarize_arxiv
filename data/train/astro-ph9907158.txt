    "the shape of both peaks is clearly energy - dependent .",
    "this _ letter _ concentrates on the high energy x - ray spectrum ( @xmath13  kev ) , based on the hpgspc and pds data . in consideration of the strong phase dependence of the cyclotron lines of   ( @xcite ) , we accumulated the pha spectra over 10 pulse phase intervals .",
    "initially , these spectra were divided by the pha spectrum of the crab nebula and multiplied by the spectral shape of the crab nebula , a power - law with photon index , @xmath14 , of 2.1 , such that marked spectral features could be spotted in an approximately model- and calibration - independent fashion ( @xcite ) .",
    "dips at @xmath012  kev , @xmath024  kev , and @xmath036  kev and , possibly , @xmath048  kev were apparent in the spectra from a number of phase intervals .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of the descending edge of the main peak ( phase of 0.20.3 ) , shown in fig.[fig : crab_ratios ] , displayed by far the deepest features at @xmath012  kev , @xmath024  kev , @xmath036  kev and a clear evidence of a dip at @xmath048  kev .",
    "this motivated us to carry out a detailed spectral analysis , with models including multiple harmonic features .",
    "we used the following continuum models to fit the 9100  kev spectra : ( a ) the negative and positive power laws exponential ( npex ) model adopted by mihara ( 1995 ) as the standard model for x  ray pulsars observed with _ ginga _ , @xmath15 ; ( b ) a power law with a high energy cut - off , @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the photon flux , @xmath18 is the e - folding energy and @xmath14 is the photon index .",
    "independent of the continuum model used , at least three absorption - like features were required in the fit .",
    "these features were introduced in the model(s ) as gaussian filters in absorption , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the centroid energy , width and depth of each feature . introducing the third absorption feature at @xmath23  kev ( in addition to the first two harmonics at @xmath24 and @xmath25  kev ) led to a pronounced improvement in the fit , with the reduced @xmath26 decreasing from 2.5 ( 268 dof ) to 1.7 ( 265 dof ) in the case of the npex model .",
    "an f test shows that the probability of chance improvement is of @xmath27 .",
    "the hpgspc and pds count spectra of the descending edge of the main peak ( pulse phase 0.20.3 ) , together with the best fit model described above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( upper panel ) : an additonal feature centered around @xmath048  kev is clearly apparent in the residuals of both the hpgspc and pds spectra ( fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] bottom panel ) .",
    "this prompted us to introduce a fourth absorption feature , @xmath28 , in the model ; the minimum @xmath26 decreased to 1.24 ( 262 dof , npex continuum ) , corresponding to an f - test probability of chance improvement of @xmath29 .",

    "best fit parameters and equivalent widths are summarized in table  [ tab : best_fit ] . in the same table",
    "best - fit parameters obtained by using the power - law with an exponential cut - off are also given .",
    "we also performed a fit with all the line centroids constrained to an integer harmonic spacing .",
    "the resulting minimum @xmath26 is 1.58(259 dof ) for the npex model and 1.67(259 dof ) for the power law plus cutoff model .",
    "an f - test gives a probability of chance improvement for the models with non - constrained line centroids @xmath30 in both cases .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the spectra from other phase intervals also shows significant variations of the line features with the pulse phase confirming previous findings from _ ginga _ and _ rossixte _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "variations up to 10% in centroid energy are observed .",
    "three lines are still observed at the descending edge of the soft broad peak , at phase 0.50.6 , with centroid energies of @xmath31  kev , @xmath32  kev and @xmath33  kev . a comparison with the centroid energies of the three harmonics derived by heindl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , based on _ rossixte _ data is far from straightforward in consideration of the close but still different pulse phase interval ( 0.7 - 0.76 ) over which their spectrum was accumulated and considering also the different phase of the outburst .",
    "the spectroscopic capabilities of the high energy instruments ( hpgspc and pds ) onboard  allowed to us study multiple absorption - like features in the spectrum of the x - ray pulsar transient   . in particular four features centered at energies of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36  kev , and @xmath37  kev were found in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile .",
    "we fitted the line centroids in table 1 with a simple linear model for the form @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40 a free parameter ) .",
    "unacceptable values of @xmath41 were obtained : 79.3(3 ) for the power law plus cutoff model and 71.4(3 ) for the npex model .",
    "we conclude that the line centroids reported in table 1 are not equispaced , for both continuum models",
    ". stated differently , the corresponding harmonic ratios 1:(@xmath42):(@xmath43):(@xmath44 ) are significantly different from the classical values 1:2:3:4 . a closer look at the data reveals that this result can be ascribed entirely to the value of the centroid of the first harmonic . as an example , in the case of a power law plus cutoff model , the first harmonic is at 12.79@xmath450.05 kev , while a fit to the other three harmonics gives a spacing of 12.02@xmath450.02 kev .",
    "similar results are obtained by using the centroid energies obtained from the npex continuum model .",
    "we note that , since the first harmonics lies close to the energy interval over which the slope of the x - ray spectrum steepens rapidly , the determination of its centroid energy could be affected by a somewhat inadequate modelling of the continuum . for example , the excess of  shoulder \" photons , below the fundamental , as predicted in many theoretical calculations ( @xcite ) , may cause the fitted centroid energy of the fundamental to appear higher , therefore causing the harmonic ratios to be somewhat smaller than expected .",
    "it is well know that in strong magnetic fields , the energy spacing of cyclotron harmonics is altered by relativistic effects , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46^{1/2}-1\\ } /\\sin^2\\theta$ ] , where @xmath47 is the electron mass , @xmath48 the angle between the photon propagation angle and the b - field , and @xmath49  g ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this formula , further corrected for the gravitational redshift , was fit to the centroid energies of the four harmonics observed by _",
    "bepposax_. while formally unacceptable ( @xmath41 79.9(2 ) for the power law plus cutoff model and 35.7(2 ) for the npex model ) , the best fit obtained in this way was somewhat better than the simple linear fit .    despite the uncertainties described above , we conclude that the centroid energies of the four spectral features of ",
    "are most naturally interpreted in terms of the fundamental , second , third and fourth harmonics of cyclotron resonant features in a strong magnetic field , taking into account relativistic corrections .",
    "this is the first time that four harmonics are observed in the x - ray spectrum of any cosmic source .",
    "we find that equivalent widths of the second , third , and fourth harmonics are larger than that of the fundamental , confirming and extending previous results from _ ginga _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a trend was predicted by alexander & mszros ( 1989 , 1991 ) , who found that two - photon scattering and two - photon emission processes have a major effect in determining the depth of the second and higher harmonics relative to the fundamental .",
    "detailed calculations show that , while the equivalent width of the second harmonic is always larger than the fundamental , this is not necessarily the case for the third ( and the fourth ) harmonics .",
    "in fact the strength of the third harmonic depends strongly on @xmath48 and the optical depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of our measured spectra with the ones calculated by alexander & mszros ( 1991 ) shows a qualitative agreement .",
    "a systematic study of the  spectra of   as function of pulse phase for different mass accretion rates ( _ i.e. _ different outburst phases ) is currently underway and will be published elsewhere .",
