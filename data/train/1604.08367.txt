    "<S> the chern number of lattice yields the number of parallel thermal edge channels , so high chern number states are generally more effective thermal conductors compared to low chern number states . </S>",
    "<S> also , majorana bound states trapped in lattice defects could also be interesting from quantum information point of view . while the applications of chiral superconductors are still emerging , our work points to a conceptually simple method to obtain them in nanofabricated structures .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions _ in this work we proposed a method to engineer topological states by potential impurities deposited on 2d chiral superconductors . in particular , we presented a microscopic theory of chiral @xmath1-wave superconductors with impurity lattices . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to calculate the topological phase diagram for general impurity strengths and hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> our results have remarkable conceptual and practical consequences : given a 2d chiral superconductor , it is possible to fabricate a large number of nontrivial descendant states by a straightforward procedure . because potential - induced subgap states are generic in time - reversal breaking superconductors and superfluids , our results have universal appeal irrespective of the platform and microscopic details of the chiral state .    </S>",
