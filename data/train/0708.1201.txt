    "our picture of nuclei of seyfert galaxies relies on the unified scheme ( @xcite ) , which assumes that the central source a black hole , an accretion disk , and broad line region  is embedded within an optically thick molecular torus located at a distances larger than @xmath9  pc . over a certain luminosity range ,",
    "the structure of these main ingredients are considered almost identical in all active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and the apparent differences among individual objects are ascribed to their orientation with respect to our line of sight ; the object is classified as a seyfert 1 if the line of sight lies within the opening angle of the torus , and as a seyfert 2 if observed through the obscuring material .    because the nuclear intrinsic light in the optical , ultraviolet , and soft x - ray frequencies is absorbed by the torus , seyfert 2 agns can be seen at these energies only through reprocessed emission .",
    "a large population of such obscured agns could make the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ; @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , ) provided that a typical torus is optically thick to electron scattering and subtends a large solid angle as seen from the central source . from observations of such obscured agns",
    ", we can investigate the circum - nuclear environment ( e.g. their geometry , ionization state , etc . ) , thorough the reprocessed emission which would be diluted by the intrinsic emission in seyfert  1 s . from a fair number of seyfert  2 agns ,",
    "the satellite actually observed evidence for such emission , e.g. strong iron line complex and hard continua , in energies from a  few  kev to 10  kev ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since only hard x - rays can penetrate the obscuring material , observations in such energy range are crucial to the investigation of hidden nuclei , or even to their discovering .",
    "many of pioneering works on this field were done with satellite , with its hard x - ray sensitivity up to @xmath10  kev ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",

    "the obscuring material was found to be even opaque to compton scattering , with @xmath14 reaching a  few ( @xcite ) , where @xmath15 is the thomson cross section . in such `` compton - thick '' agns ,",

    "we can not constrain the high energy spectral cutoff . although it is required in the broad band fitting around 200  kev ( see table [ tab : first ] ) , when the systematic error on the gso background modeling ( 2% ) is taken into account , we obtain only its lower limit of @xmath64  kev . nonetheless , a cutoff energy around 100 - 300  kev is consistent with the one obtained from this source , and those measured in several seyfert 1s ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , , , ) .      the observed average 1050 kev flux was @xmath142 erg  s@xmath30  @xmath1 , which is @xmath141 and @xmath143 times that measured by and , respectively . at the level of @xmath144  @xmath1 ,",
    "the optical depth to electron scattering will become rather high , @xmath145 or so .",
    "in such a case , the observed spectrum and flux would depend significantly on the geometry of the absorbing matter ( @xcite ) , even though the intrinsic luminosity is the same . the model ` cabs ` assumes a configuration where a small blob of matter scatters some of the primary flux out of the line of sight .",
    "if , on the contrary , the re - processing matter has a large solid angle to the central source , a fraction of the photons will also be scattered into the line of sight , and the nuclear luminosity required to explain the observed flux will decrease . at the same time , such scattered photons would significantly dilute the time variability of the intrinsic source .",
    "based on the observed rapid ( less than 1-day ) hard x - ray variability in ngc  4945 , @xcite argued that the compton - thick absorber must be geometrically - thin , with a half angle of less than 10@xmath146 as seen from the central source .",
    "if this is the case , the configuration assumed by ` cabs ` is considered to be more realistic .",
    "while the present data strongly points to a geometrically thin absorber , the scenario requires a relatively high nuclear intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the extrapolation of the best - fit model to the 210 kev band , corrected for photo - electric absorption alone , yields a flux of @xmath147  erg  s@xmath30  @xmath1 . further correcting this for the thomson opacity , i.e. multiplying a factor @xmath148 where @xmath149",
    ", we obtain @xmath150  erg  s@xmath30  @xmath1 , and hence a 210  kev intrinsic luminosity of @xmath151  erg  s@xmath30 . using the bolometric corrections of @xcite , a bolometric luminosity of @xmath152  erg  s@xmath30",
    "is derived , which in turn is @xmath16% of the eddington limit .",
    "although the inferred @xmath153 is unplausibly large , this value is strongly dependent on @xmath11 , and there is also some scatter in the bolometric corrections ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we can also get @xmath154% within errors , and hence the scenario is energetically feasible .",
    "the derived bolometric luminosity is of the same order of magnitude as the observed infrared luminosity of the nucleus ( @xcite ) , and hence the agn can dominate the energy output from the nucleus .",
    "the flux of the intrinsic emission in the 1250  kev band showed variations by a factor of 2 on a time scale of @xmath7  ks .",
    "similar variability was observed with every previous mission ( , , ) . from the 1250  kev light curve",
    ", we calculated excess variance @xmath155 ( @xcite ) in the same manner as @xcite , to find @xmath156 .",
    "this value lies well on the @xmath157 vs @xmath155 relationship derived from a number of seyfert  1 agns ; the expected @xmath158 for @xmath159 is -1.25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the intrinsic variability is diluted by scattered photons , and supports the idea that the re - processing material be geometrically - thin .",
    "the spectrum below 10  kev showed evidence of reflection from cold matter , and was modeled with a hard reflection continuum and neutral emission lines .",
    "the derived equivalent width of the fe  i  k@xmath3 line , ranging @xmath160  kev , is consistent with those expected when the line is produced in an optically - thick material with solar abundance ( ranging between 1.3  kev and 2.7  kev , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the fe k@xmath3 i line and the reflection continuum are generated by the same material ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that preferred a transmission origin for the line as the spectrum below 7  kev is not well fit by reflection alone",
    ". however , this is due to there being additional complex low energy emission from hot gas ( some of which can be spatially resolved e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our detection of the compton shoulder at @xmath161 confirms a reflection origin , as transmission predicts @xmath162 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath163 also indicates that the reflector is probably seen nearly edge on ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also detect for the first time the associated fe  i  k@xmath4 and ni  i  k@xmath3 lines from the reflector .",
    "the flux of these lines are @xmath164 and @xmath165 of that of fe  i  k@xmath3 , respectively , which also agree with the value expected from the neutral reflection .",
    "the obtained @xmath166 is quite small at a  few  @xmath167 . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : disc1 ] , the estimation of the intrinsic flux , and hence of @xmath166 , is strongly affected by the geometry of the compton - thick absorber . in the most extreme case ,",
    "i.e. when the absorber is spherically surrounding the continuum source , the intrinsic flux would be 36 times lower than derived here ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "even in that case , @xmath166 still remains @xmath168  a  few  @xmath169 , which is significantly smaller than those of the other compton - thick seyfert 2 agns ; e.g. @xmath170 in mkn  3 ( @xcite , awaki et al .",
    "this might be explained by assuming the reflector to be located nearly edge - on angle ; so we fitted the spectrum with @xmath171 , to find that the @xmath166 value increases by only a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "the small @xmath166 implies that we see in the reflection only a small part of the illuminated disk on the far side of itself .",
    "all the above evidence on the re - processed signals implies that the geometrically - thin / disk - like reflector is viewed from a near edge - on angle .",
    "considering that the h@xmath19o megamaser emission requires an edge - on inner disk geometry in this source ( @xcite ) , the simplest explanation of the reflector , absorber and maser source is that these are all the same structure , namely the accretion disk ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the accretion structure in this source could be different from a typical agn which is considered to have a putative torus with a large covering factor .",
    "another remaining question is the origin of the ionized fe line observed at @xmath126  kev .",
    "the bc + scattered power - law model gives a slightly better fit than the bc + thermal model , to the spectral curvature around 4  kev .",
    "however , this is probably simply due to there being more free parameters in this model , and it is thus difficult to provide any clearcut preference on the origin of the soft x - ray continuum and the ionized line from our data . in this section ,",
    "we therefore only discuss physical consistency of each of our scenarios .    from its energy ,",
    "the ionized line is consistent with the resonance line , @xmath172 , at 6.700  kev or the intercombination lines , @xmath173 , at 6.682 and 6.668  kev , or their mixture .",
    "a strong contribution from the forbidden line , @xmath174 , at 6.637  kev , is clearly ruled out by the mean line energy .",
    "collisionally ionized plasmas have @xmath175 while a pure photo - ionized plasma has @xmath176 as the resonance line is weak .",
    "note that contamination from dielectronic lines is not important at the inferred temperature of @xmath177  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , continuum photons enhance @xmath172 through resonance line scattering , so the observed line energy can also be consistent with photo - ionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature of @xmath178  kev estimated from the thermal plasma model is rather high compared to those expected from ordinary star - burst activity ( @xmath179  ev ) , and difficult to produce ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a similar temperature was observed in a nearby pure star - burst galaxy ngc  253 ( ) . from the scattered continuum model",
    ", we obtained @xmath180 .",
    "the column density of the photo - ionized gas can be estimated on the basis of this ratio . in order to have an order of magnitude estimate we assume a covering factor of @xmath132 ,",
    "then the gas column density would be @xmath181  @xmath1 .",
    "this value lies within those estimated in other obscured agns ( e.g. ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe  xxv  k@xmath3 and fe  xxvi  k@xmath3 lines with respect to the scattered power - law , i.e. @xmath90  kev and @xmath91  kev , respectively , are consistent with the both components originating from a photo - ionized gas ( see calculations in ; @xcite ) .",
    "to highly ionize the iron , the region where the line originates needs to be close to the central source so that its flux could potentially vary as the primary continuum does .",
    "we searched in vain for any time variability of the ionized lines .",
    "therefore , both of our scenarios are considered to be physically consistent . yet",
    "another possibility is that the ionized line , together with the modeled scattered continuum , arise from unresolved point sources ( @xcite ) .",
