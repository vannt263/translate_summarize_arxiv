    "the old stellar populations in globular clusters and galaxies are important tracers of the histories of galaxies and can help decide among various current models of the formation of galaxies .",
    "for example , if an elliptical galaxy forms in a simple , isolated , dynamical collapse , its stars form primarily at early times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the hierarchical assemblage of an elliptical galaxy from smaller pieces , in mergers accompanied by star formation , leads naturally to a substantial intermediate - age population ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although globular clusters and elliptical galaxies harbor similar populations @xcite , they do have certain disparate properties that make it difficult to establish their relative ages .",
    "the major complication is the variation in elemental abundances @xcite .",
    "luminous elliptical galaxies are metal - rich and show an enhancement in the magnesium - to - iron abundance ratio relative to that of the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while andromeda globulars reach higher metallicities than do those of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that there is an `` age - metallicity degeneracy '' , i.e.very little difference between the optical spectra of two old systems in which one has twice the age and three - fourths the metallicity of the other .",
    "the balmer lines of hydrogen can break this degeneracy , but their strengths are also influenced by stars hotter than the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "@xcite showed that m31 globular clusters of moderate to high metallicity exhibit anomalously strong h@xmath1 and cn line absorption compared to those of milky way globulars , and that their cn ( but not h@xmath1 ) is stronger than in nuclei of elliptical galaxies .",
    "they considered whether the balmer - line enhancement might be due to anomalously hot stars on the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) , or to unevolved blue stragglers situated on the main sequence blueward of the turnoff . in the end , they favored the possibility that these m31 globulars might be younger than those of the milky way , since this might also account for the anomalous cn absorption .",
    "subsequent work has confirmed several important distinctions among these groups , but has generally not supported substantial differences in age . @xcite",
    "confirmed from optical spectra that cn is enhanced in the metal - rich m31 globulars relative to those of the milky way , and again argued for younger ages ; but @xcite noted that the  anomalies in m31 globulars all but disappeared when  was plotted against a magnesium index rather than an iron index .",
    "mid - uv measurements from the astro / ultraviolet imaging telescope @xcite suggested that the ages of the overwhelming majority of m31 globulars were comparable to those of the milky way .",
    "while @xcite deduced from stellar mid - uv spectra obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) that uv feature distinctions are primarily due to abundance differences , @xcite emphasized that feature strengths could also be affected by old , evolved subdwarf b / o stars  the visually faint but very hot `` extreme '' horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars responsible for the upturn in far - uv flux seen in luminous ellipticals @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we re - examine these issues using the @xcite spectra of the moderately metal - rich m31 globular cluster g1 ( @xmath2 k1 @xmath2 mayall ii ) .",
    "this bright , spatially extended , well - studied cluster is partially resolved into stars by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "@xcite found that its @xmath3 color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) bore a strong resemblance to that of the milky way globular cluster 47 tucanae , suggesting a similar age and metallicity for both clusters .",

    "in this work , we fit simple composite theoretical spectra to the @xcite g1 mid - uv spectra ( 2280 - 3120 , 5.5  resolution ) and optical spectra ( 3850 - 4750 , 8.8  resolution ) taken with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) faint object spectrograph ( fos ) .",
    "we use the observed cmd s for g1 @xcite and 47 tuc @xcite to guide our modeling .",
    "we forego a detailed spectral synthesis in favor of a weighted combination of the spectra of a few representative types of star , to avoid introducing a large number of free parameters whose individual effects can not be judged .",
    "consequently we ignore for now the possibility of a spread in metallicity among g1 stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have recently used empirical spectral libraries to explore fits to high - resolution optical and mid - uv spectra of old populations .",
    "such fits are necessarily limited by the characteristics of the population of relatively nearby , bright stars , which includes very few old hot stars and stars with non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "in contrast , our theoretical approach allows us to explore explicitly the effects of stars with a wide range of abundance ratios , and of hot stars representing both young main - sequence a stars and the hot horizontal - branch stars of the halo population .",
    "our results illustrate the basic gains achieved in fitting integrated optical and uv spectra when stellar parameters can be varied at will . as part of our future work under our hubble treasury program go-9455",
    ", we will eventually produce a library of theoretical stellar spectra , enabling a detailed spectral synthesis",
    ". however , our primary results from this simple modeling are robust enough and interesting enough that we want to draw attention to them at this stage .",
    "the spectral calculations for this work were run with the @xcite program synthe following the procedures of pdr01 .",
    "the same models were employed , those of @xcite downloaded from the kurucz web site and modified at the surface , for pdr01 showed that only models such as these  in which convective overshoot in the photosphere is turned off  can simultaneously reproduce the optical and mid - uv spectra of solar - type stars .",
    "the input list of mid - uv line parameters was largely that of pdr01 .",
    "we made additional changes to kurucz transition probabilities for atomic lines identified in the laboratory , added even more `` missing '' lines not yet so identified , and halved the absorption due to the mgi  bound - free edge near 2510 , to better match space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) spectra of a dozen stars of near - solar temperature spanning a wide range of metallicity .",
    "the input list of optical line parameters is based on the kurucz laboratory atomic line parameters , again with corrections like those of @xcite to match the sun but without adding missing lines .",
    "theoretical molecular line parameters were used in both wavelength regions , with modifications to match the sun . in the mid - uv ,",
    "we reduced by 0.15 dex both the theoretical oh transition probabilities of goldman for the 0 - 0 , 1 - 1 , 2 - 2 , 1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , and 3 - 2 bands , and the lifbase ch lines , all provided by m. bessell ( private communication , aug .  and oct .",

    "the kurucz ch transition probabilities were lowered by 0.15 dex for lines with at least one energy level measured in the laboratory , and by 1.0 dex for lines with both energy levels predicted rather than measured .",
    "the kurucz cn transition probabilities were used without change .",
    "composite spectra were generated by coadding spectra calculated for up to six representative types of star .",
    "their characteristics are given in table  1 .",

    "this probably reflects residual problems with the ch transition probabilities ; if so , ch will be overestimated in all comparisons .",
    "continuum definition affects 106516 alone , for the g1 spectra were obtained from space and are on an absolute flux scale .    despite its simplicity",
    ", our approach leads to very good fits to both the mid - uv and the optical observations of g1 .",
    "our best - fit spectra are shown at the top of figures 1 and 2 .",

    "their iron abundance [ fe / h ]  = @xmath11 , the mild enhancement of light @xmath15-elements , and average turnoff temperature  = 6050k , all resemble those of mildly metal - poor field halo and globular cluster stars in the galaxy .",
    "106516 is hotter than 6000k , but @xcite identify it as a blue straggler from its binary orbit .",
    "their fig .",
    "1 shows that it is slightly bluer than field turnoff stars of similar [ fe / h ] .",
    "thus this fit implies a similar age and light - element enhancement for g1 as for the oldest galactic stars , except for its cn .    throughout the mid - uv in the top plot of fig .  1 , the model fits the g1 spectrum nearly as well as the stellar model fits the 106516 spectrum , and has very similar discrepancies .",
    "these are attributed by pdr01 to problems remaining with the mid - uv line list . in the optical , most features",
    "are rather well matched , including , caii  h + , and caii  k. ( unfortunately , the m31 g1 optical spectrum does not extend redward as far as , at 4861 . )",
    "the ch band head is too strong by roughly the same relative amount as in 106516 , as is expected if gf - values are in error .",
    "however , the cn band near 3886  is far too weak . in 106516 neither this cn band nor the one at 4210is detected in the pdr01 echelle spectrum . like others before us",
    ", we can not explain the very strong cn in g1 .    at the top of fig .  2 , we show composite spectra designed to test for an age - bhb degeneracy .",
    "they are constructed with the same metallicity and flux - weighting factors as for the best fit , except that the turnoff temperature was increased and the weight of the cool bhb model was decreased .",
    "this fit is hardly distinguishable from the best fit ; the caii  h +  and the cores of lines below 2600  become slightly stronger .",
    "this suggests that when cool bhb stars are present in signficant but unknown numbers , the turnoff temperature may be uncertain by @xmath6100k even if metallicity and reddening are fixed . only the flux ratio rules out a larger uncertainty in temperature and thus age .",
    "the next - to - top plots illustrate the extent to which the age - metallicity degeneracy persists in the mid - uv . both depict fits to bhb+ehb models : [ fe / h ]  = @xmath5 in fig .",
    "1 , and [ fe / h ]  = @xmath12 in fig .  2 .",
    "both fits are still reasonable , marginally worse than the best fit , and both have flux ratios of unity to within the uncertainties .",
    "the [ fe / h ]  = @xmath5 model is unlikely , however , as its turnoff temperature of 5900k implies an age for the cluster that is probably greater than that of the field halo stars .",
    "a moderately old , mildly metal - poor population remains a possibility for g1 .",
    "this metallicity might be appropriate if abundance rises towards the very center of g1 , since the fos spectra were taken through a 1  aperture at the center .",
    "however , even at this metallicity , cn is still not nearly strong enough .    the third plot from the top of fig .",
    "1 portrays composite spectra with hot and cool blue stragglers instead of ehb and cool bhb stars . here",
    ", the mid - uv fit is poorer than in the top plot ; neither the mgii  region nor the region below 2600  is as well reproduced .",
    "a similar but more extreme mismatch is seen in the third plot from the top of fig .  2 , based on a single bss of intermediate temperature .",
    "a somewhat better fit is shown in the fourth plot from the top of fig .  2 ,",
    "in which only a hot blue straggler is included .",
    "however , in all these blue - straggler composite models , the 2900 ",
    "3100  lines are too weak as well .",
    "while a higher metallicity would alleviate this , the optical lines would then be too strong .",
    "also , the mid - uv magnesium lines are poorly matched : the mgi  line at 2856  is too weak , while the mgii  line wings are too weak and its core often is too strong . adding",
    "main - sequence stars would alleviate this discrepancy , but again this would spoil the agreement in the optical . to fit both",
    "the mid - uv and optical spectra of g1 thus requires bhb stars rather than bss .    the fourth plot from the top of fig .",
    "1 shows a composite spectrum like that of the best fit , but lacking the ehb model .",
    "the optical region is matched rather well , but the observed mid - uv fluxes are seriously underestimated in deeper lines and at shorter wavelengths . this discrepancy would be reduced if scattered light is present in the g1 spectrum .",
    "however , the iraf fos tasks countspec and bspec were run for a g2v model specifically for this configuration , resulting in levels of scattered light always less than 3% for both the mid - uv and the optical g1 spectra .",
    "only if scattered light comprises @xmath610% of the maximum level of the mid - uv spectrum would the observed g1 mid - uv spectrum match this calculated bhb spectrum without ehb stars .",
    "the fifth plot from the top of both figures portrays composite spectra with no hot stars at all . in order to preserve the balmer - line strengths and the slope of the optical continuum at the same metallicity and light - element ratio as the top plot ,",
    "the ratio was decreased of rhb + rgb stars to msto + ms stars and the turnoff temperature was raised to 6250k for the plot in fig .  1 .",
    "in the optical , the fit is respectable , although for the balmer and the caii  lines the fit is substantially worse than in the top plot . in the mid - uv , however , the deterioration of the fit is dramatic .",
    "both line strengths and the slope of the mid - uv flux are very poorly reproduced .",
    "the mid - uv fit is improved but still unsatisfactory in the fifth plot of fig .  2 , in which a higher metallicity and hotter turnoff temperature were adopted .",
    "we have shown that composite theoretical spectra calculated from scratch with stellar models and our modified line list provide an excellent match to observed mid - uv and optical spectra of the m31 globular cluster g1 , but only if blue horizontal branch stars are included .",
    "the average turnoff temperature of 6050  of the best - fit composite spectra ( shown at the top of figs .  1 and 2 ) is like that of milky way globular clusters and the halo field , suggesting a similarly old age for g1 .",
    "the observed great strength of cn remains unexplained , however .",
    "the metallicity of the best - fit spectrum , @xmath4}}= -0.8 $ ] ( one - sixth solar ) , agrees well with the @xcite conclusion from the color of its giants that g1 is `` at least as metal - rich as 47 tuc . ''",

    "@xcite infer @xmath4}}= -0.95 $ ] for g1 , but our best fit at @xmath5 requires a turnoff temperature that would render g1 older than milky way globular clusters or the halo field .",
    "a multi - metallicity model might overcome this objection ; we have not yet considered such models .",
    "the weighting factors for the best - fit spectra imply as many or more ehb as cool bhb stars , and one cool bhb star for every seven to eleven rhb stars in g1whose cmd otherwise resembles that of 47 tuc .",
    "the cool - bhb / rhb ratio is consistent with the small but nonzero number of cool bhb stars seen near the limiting magnitude of the g1 cmd @xcite .",
    "the ehb stars are visually too faint to have been detected there .",

    "although the latter is metal - poor , its giants clearly span a range of metallicity @xcite , and its bhb stars appear to have higher metallicities at bluer colors @xcite .",

    "the ehb stars account for one - third of the light below 2400  but 25% at 2550 , and @xmath1710% above 2900 .",
    "the effect of the ehb model is to weaken metal line strengths below 2500while simultaneously raising the overall fluxes towards the blue end of the mid - uv .",
    "the contributions to the 47 tuc spectrum that @xcite deduced at 2680  are 15% from giants and rhb stars and 78% from msto stars , plus 7% from blue stragglers . at this wavelength , msto and cooler ms stars in our best - fit model of fig .  1 contribute 35% and 24% , versus 3.5% from giants and rhb s , 24% from cool bhb stars , and 13% from ehb stars .",

    "the large discrepancy in the turnoff / giant ratio between our models and that of @xcite might be due not only to our larger hot - star component , but also to the adoption of different temperatures and/or abundances of the giant and ms stars .",

    "the rgb + rhb contribution is 55% ; the ms , 14% ; the msto , 18% ; and the cool bhb , 13% .",
    "these percentage fluxes and figs .  1 and 2",
    "show that the g1 optical spectrum by itself does not demand a hot component . as seen in the next - to - bottom plot in fig",
    ".  1 , an acceptable fit in the optical can be obtained without hot stars , at the same metallicity as the best fit , by increasing the proportion of cool stars and raising the turnoff temperature by 250k  thereby reducing the inferred age . in fig .  2 ,",
    "a similarly good fit is obtained with a higher metallicity and turnoff temperature . however , both these fits are unacceptable in the mid - uv . to match the elevated mid - uv fluxes below 2650 , to fit the shallow cores of strong mid - uv lines , and to preserve the strengths of weaker lines at 2900 ",
    "3100  at the metallicity dictated by the optical , models hotter than about 8000k are required .",
    "the effect of such models is illustrated explicitly in figure  3 , which plots the theoretical fluxes for several models used in generating the composite spectra of fig .  1 .",
    "in the optical , the models that are 8000k and hotter contribute strong balmer lines but no metallic or molecular lines ( except for caii  in the 8000k model ) , and a continuum that rises towards the blue .",
    "together these characteristics explain why the turnoff temperature changes when they are included . in the mid - uv ,",
    "the 8000k and 10,000k models show flat , weak - lined spectra , while the 26,000k model spectrum shows virtually no lines and rises steeply bluewards .",
    "in contrast , the models at lower temperatures show progressively stronger lines and weaker fluxes towards the blue .",
    "the fits using model spectra with blue stragglers of the same metallicity as the cluster are not as good as those with hot horizontal branch stars .",
    "this is largely because the hottest feasible blue straggler model is 10,000k , resulting in too little flux below 2650  and too much line dilution near 3000 .",
    "our discussion of the plots in figs .",
    "1 and 2 has established that a bhb population is required to match the g1 spectra , even though our spectral analysis is limited in the number of models considered and adopts a constant metallicity .    in previous modeling of old stellar systems ,",
    "bhb stars have been considered but usually dismissed .",
    "tools for incorporating them were limited ; as described below , we are planning to address this both theoretically and observationally .",
    "moreover , there was no theoretical or empirical expectation that bhb stars should occur at high metallicity . however , cool bhb stars are now known to exist not only in g1 , but also in several metal - rich environments within the galaxy . @xcite",
    "have found bhb stars in two globular clusters in the galactic disk , with metallicities one - fourth solar . in a photometric and spectroscopic",
    "survey for bhb stars in the galactic bulge , @xcite have found two cool bhb stars with solar metallicity in a field 7.5@xmath13 from the galactic center . the old open cluster 6791 contains several possible bhb stars @xcite , including four or five sdb / o stars ( liebert et  al . ) the coolest of the bhb stars  both a radial - velocity and a proper - motion member  was found by @xcite to have @xmath4}}= + 0.4 \\pm 0.1 $ ] dex , and to have temperature , gravity , and rotational velocity consistent with a cool bhb star .",
    "our theoretical modeling of the spectrum of g1 , however simple , has achieved very good fits to its observed mid - uv and optical spectra , except for cn .",
    "only two normalization constants were applied to the data ; their ratio is consistent with the foreground reddening expected for this cluster .",
    "the proportions of the primary stellar components considered are in accord with observations of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the cool bhb stars required are present in the g1 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the metallicity deduced for g1 is like that of the galactic globular 47 tucanae , whose color - magnitude diagram is also very similar .",
    "the age inferred is comparable to that of the galactic halo .",
    "provided the elevated flux level below 2500  in the g1 spectrum is not due to scattered light , the extremely hot ehb stars are also required , in numbers comparable to those of the cool bhb stars .",
    "the ehb stars are too faint for detection in the red cmd of g1 , but in the galaxy , they outnumber cool bhb s in both the metal - rich open cluster 6791 ( liebert et  al . ) and in the globular cluster  @xcite .      * the near uv provides important additional constraints to interpreting the spectra of remote composite systems",
    ". however , the age - metallicity degeneracy remains at some level even in the near uv .",
    "* the mid - uv spectral region can be modeled reliably by theoretical spectral calculations , but up - to - date models and line lists must be used . as demonstrated by pdr01 , models of stellar photospheres should have convective overshoot turned off .",
    "line lists must incorporate revised _",
    "gf_-values and atomic lines not yet identified in the laboratory , and so must be tested by comparison with observed spectra of stars spanning the relevant range of spectral type and metallicity . * blue horizontal branch stars must be included in composite spectra , now that they are observed in many metal - rich systems in the galaxy as well as in m31 g1 itself .",
    "* when bhb stars are included , the age of g1 does not appear to differ substantially from that of galactic globular clusters .",
    "ages of andromeda globulars will be underestimated from the balmer lines whenever bhb stars are present but not accounted for .      *",
    "main sequence , turnoff , subgiant , and red giant weighting factors should be calculated from stellar isochrones including light - element enhancements , and compared directly to in - depth star counts of the 47 tuc cmd . because several galactic globulars have rather different cmd s within and outside their cores , attention should be paid to the spatial region probed by the cmd .",
    "* plausible distributions of bhb and blue stragglers should be included , both separately and in the same model , since  and many other galactic globulars show both . * a variable overall metallicity",
    "should also be considered .",
    "the relative abundances of critical elements such as magnesium , calcium , and nitrogen should be varied as well . * a large grid of theoretical model spectra",
    "must be calculated to allow accurate interpolation for all of these possible components .",
    "we plan to continue this work under our three - year hubble treasury program go-9455 .",
    "the mid - uv line list of pdr01 will first be improved , using updated laboratory measurements and new comparisons against high - quality mid - uv spectra to be taken in cycles 11 and 12 of msto stars , giants , and bhb / ehb stars of the field , and blue - straggler and turnoff stars in open clusters",
    ". this should provide good mid - uv fits for stars of solar metallicity and higher , and for stars hotter and cooler than the sun .",
    "it will also provide a more extensive set of empirical mid - uv stellar spectral templates .",
    "we will then calculate complete grids of theoretical stellar mid - uv spectra , and generate composite spectra using dozens of stellar models rather than the six considered here .",
    "their relative weights will be derived from isochrones calculated both with and without enhanced abundances of magnesium , nitrogen , and other light elements .",
    "they will be tested against stis spectra to be taken of g1 and four other m31 globular clusters .",
    "all of our stis observations are being made public as they are taken , and the grids of theoretical stellar and composite spectra will be made public as they are completed . at that point , it should be possible for anyone to judge from mid - uv and optical spectra to what extent bhb stars might be contributing to the strong  indexes seen in most metal - rich m31 globular clusters , and to what extent their ages are affected .",
