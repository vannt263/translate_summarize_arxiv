    "the goal of sn  ia progenitor studies is to use these measures of sn  ia intrinsic variation to explore trends with host properties that could shed light on the underlying population that produces sne  ia @xcite .    since sn",
    "ia explosions are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath2ni , it is widely accepted that the intrinsic variation in sn  ia brightness and decline rate is primarily driven by the amount of @xmath2ni present in the sn explosion , with more luminous and slower declining explosions being powered by more @xmath2ni @xcite .",
    "one avenue of exploration would be to connect this theoretical idea to the progenitor population of sne  ia by comparing host galaxy properties with the measures of sn  ia light curve variation .",
    "this requires a mechanism that varies the amount of @xmath2ni as a function of some property of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite presented a model relating progenitor metallicity to produced sn  ia @xmath2ni mass for a constant ( solar ) o / fe ratio .",

    "their data are consistent with the model , although with a higher scatter than predicted by the theory . they also found that varying the o / fe ratio according to thin or thick - disk models produced no substantial change in their results .",
    "if the dependance of @xmath2ni mass on host metallicity is real , then fainter and faster declining sne  ia should be associated with higher metallicity , and thus more massive , host galaxies .",
    "if a decline in the rate of fast fading , fainter sne  ia with redshift could be detected , it would be evidence for the relation between ni mass and metallicity because we expect the more distant universe to consist of lower - mass and lower - metallicity objects on average when compared with the local universe . at this time , however , malmquist biases complicate an accurate determination of the rate evolution for low - luminosity sne  ia @xcite .",
    "we therefore look to host properties of low - luminosity sne  ia in the local universe , where they are easier to detect and apparently more abundant .",

    "we next require sed coverage in both the uv and optical bands , further reducing our sample down to 174 hosts . at this point",

    "the 90 hosts that did not pass these criteria had no or limited optical photometry mostly due to not being members of any of the major galaxy catalogs ( i.e. , anonymous ) and not being in the sdss footprint which would allow us to derive the integrated flux from sdss imaging .",

    "the discrepancy in the sfr distributions ( figure [ fig_pegdist]c ) could be due to a luminosity bias from the host - targeted low - redshift surveys . here",
    "the higher redshift areal survey does not prefer luminous , and therefore higher sfr , hosts .",
    "these differences are reinforced if there is a correlation between mass and sfr . in this case , the same bias that produces the deficit of low - mass hosts in the local mass distribution produces the deficit of lower sfr hosts in the local sfr distribution .",

    "the apparent transition at a luminosity - weighted host age of 3 gyr ( see figure  [ fig_ni_age ] and h09 , figure 8) could place interesting constraints on progenitor scenarios given that this implies a fairly long delay time for low @xmath2ni mass , hence low - luminosity and low - stretch sne  ia .",
    "it is encouraging that the features in plots of light curve properties against host properties in local hosts are similar when compared with the snls sample out to @xmath95 @xcite , although a detailed comparison using hubble diagram residuals will be needed to determine if any significant evolution of the population can be detected @xcite .",

    "ia from low - extinction hosts would allow a more definitive test of this correlation .    while there is no apparent trend in a similar plot in (",
    "* see their figure  9 ) , we see a trend that is marginally significant .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this difference .",
    "since the hosts in the @xcite sample were selected morphologically , their sample may not be as free from dust extinction as originally thought .",
    "in addition , their corrections for light curve shape are derived with a method that assumes a milky way - like dust is responsible for residual color after a quadratic color - decline relation is subtracted ( see comparison of fitting methods in * ? ? ? * ) , which may not be appropriate for these hosts .",
    "the trend we see in figure  [ fig_age_mb ] is in the right sense to be caused by residual line - of - sight extinction since we would expect the sne hosted by the oldest galaxies to have the least non - local extinction .",
    "these data suggest that either the sne  ia or the dust produced in galaxies of different host properties are different or both .",
    "@xcite showed a weak trend in the hubble residuals when using samples divided into three host morphology bins , after removing the reddest sne .",
    "an exploration based on more physical host properties could provide a more accurate assessment of this effect @xcite .",
    "further progress may be made by extending host photometry farther into the infra - red to help constrain the host dust content and by more detailed fitting of host star - formation history to constrain the most recent episode of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "specifically , we find that the higher the ssfr of the host galaxy , the brighter and slower the sne  ia that are produced , on average .",
    "we find that the typical stretch of the sne  ia produced begins to drop after the host galaxy reaches a luminosity - weighted age of 1 gyr .",
    "we find that low stretch ( @xmath21 ) sne  ia in the local universe prefer hosts with stellar masses above @xmath53 m@xmath1 .",
    "this is unlikely to be due to a malmquist bias , since lower luminosity sne are easier to detect against lower mass , lower luminosity hosts .",
    "we find that fainter , faster sne  ia do indeed prefer more massive and presumably higher metallicity hosts , supporting the link between the production of @xmath2ni and progenitor metallicity .",
    "we suggest that it is likely that sn  ia cosmological fitting could be improved by adding a parameter characterizing the host properties to account for the impact of galaxy evolution on the evolution of sne  ia with redshift . the trends in host properties with sn  ia light curve properties support this idea and suggest that perhaps host age would be a good property to use .",
    "our sample shows no obvious trend in host properties with sn  ia peak color , except that all the reddest sne  ia appear in hosts with ages around 1 gyr .",
    "we find that the reddest sne  ia appear in hosts with a range of derived host extinctions .",

    "one possible explanation for this is that the color correction leaves a small residual brightness trend that is due to extinction and that older hosts contain less dust than younger hosts .",
    "this residual trend is consistent with the one reported in @xcite , who find that sne  ia in early - type galaxies are brighter , after shape and color correction , than sne  ia appearing in late - type hosts .    for sne  ia with @xmath96 and @xmath81",

    "<S> , we find that our local sample is consistent with a model that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the @xmath2ni mass that powers the explosion , but we can not rule out the absence of a trend . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a correlation between @xmath2ni mass and host age in the local universe that is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the age  @xmath2ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply a luminosity - weighted age threshhold of @xmath3 gyr for sn  ia hosts , above which they are less likely to produce sne  ia with @xmath2ni masses above @xmath4 m@xmath1 . </S>"
