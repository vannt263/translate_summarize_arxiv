    "the isolation of graphene sheets @xcite was soon followed by experiments @xcite on the anomalous integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) , demonstrating the formation of landau levels , described with non - interacting electron theory .",
    "subsequently , theoretical explorations @xcite appeared pertaining to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in graphene , which , in contrast to the iqhe , is known to be the manifestation of collective correlated interacting electrons phenomena . for dirac electrons in the lowest ( @xmath1 = 0 ) landau level ( lll ) , it was found @xcite ( in a spherical geometry ) that the behavior of the incompressible states in boundless graphene models emulates that of the well - known fqhe in the semiconductor 2d electron gas .",
    "@xcite recent experiments , @xcite employing small ( 1 @xmath2 m ) suspended single - sheet samples have shown that the appearance of the fqhe in graphene is accompanied by the emergence of an insulating phase .",
    "the physics that underlies this joint occurrence , coupled with the systematic theoretical overestimation @xcite of the measured fqhe excitation energies , remains unresolved ; similar findings in recent experiments on bilayer graphene @xcite further highlight these open issues .    in this paper ,",
    "we show , using exact diagonalization @xcite ( exd ) ( in the quantum hall regime ) of the many - body hamiltonian for interacting dirac electrons occupying the lll of finite planar graphene samples , that the incompressible correlated electron physics is modified [ using zigzag boundary conditions @xcite ( zbc ) ] in two main ways : ( i ) the fqhe excitation energies are significantly attenuated due to depletion of the density of the bulk component of the dirac electrons spinor , and ( ii ) the concurrent accumulation of charge at the sample edge underlies the opening of a gap in the many - electron spectrum ( increasing with the magnetic field , as observed experimentally ) , relating to the aforementioned insulating phase .",
    "underlying the above many - body behavior is the existence of lll single - particle states of mixed character , exhibiting bulk- [ darwin - fock - type @xcite ( df ) ] and edge - type components of _ equal weights _",
    "@xcite ( _ independent of sample size _ ) , each residing on a different graphene sublattice . with interelectron repulsion ,",
    "the bulk component exhibits fqhe characteristics ( with excitation energy gaps reduced by a factor of four compared to boundless graphene ) .",
    "the edge component is associated with formation of a single - ring rotating wigner molecule @xcite ( rwm ) .",
    "the size - independent influence of the graphene edge on the many - body properties ushers a new paradigm , contrasting the commonly accepted expectation that materials bulk properties are unaffected by the detailed configuration or conditions at the surface .",
    "@xcite this unique behavior derives from the two - sublattice topology of the graphene net modeled here by the continuous dirac - weyl ( dw ) equation . @xcite",
    "an important element in our approach is formulation of the solutions of the dirac - weyl equation ( with the zigzag boundary conditions ) using the kummer confluent hypergeometric function .",

    "finally , in appendix b we distinguish the mixed bulk - edge dirac spinor states ( forming the quasidegenerate lll manifold in finite graphene samples with zbc ) , where one of the spinor components is located in the bulk of the sample and the other localized at the edge , from the `` double - edge '' states where both components of the spinor represent edge states . in the `` double - edge '' case , one component corresponds to a bulk orbital which transforms ( when the orbital s centroid falls near the graphene sample boundary ) into an edge state familiar from the theory@xcite of the nonrelativistic integer qhe .",
    "the other component of the `` double - edge '' spinor , as well as the edge orbital of the aforementioned mixed bulk - edge one , corresponds to an edge state unique to the two sublattice topology of graphene . we discuss and illustrate the natural way in which the above classification of dirac - electron edge states arises within the framework of the kummer function formalism for the solution of the dw equation described in sec .",
