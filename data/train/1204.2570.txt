    "a typical 0.6 @xmath1 pure h atmosphere wd cools down to 3800 k in about 10 gyr @xcite . @xcite and @xcite were the first ones to use the oldest wds in the solar neighborhood to constrain the age of the galactic disk .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fast moving halo wds must exist in the solar neighborhood , though in relatively small numbers compared to the larger population of younger disk wds . for example , the besanon galaxy model predicts 127 disk and 3 halo wds per square degree within 1 kpc for a galactic latitude of 45@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the halo wds are predicted to be fainter than @xmath5 mag .",

    ", serendipitious discoveries of nearby halo wds have happened .",
    "wd0346 and j1102 are the best examples of such discoveries .",

    "similarly , @xcite identified j1102 as a high proper motion wd ( @xmath8 yr@xmath7 ) while searching for high - redshift quasar candidates in the sdss spectroscopy data ( the sdss spectrum of j1102 shows a broad emission feature at 5750 - 5900  , which is an artifact ) .",
    "@xcite explain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of j1102 with a 3830 k pure h atmosphere wd .",
    "however , without a parallax measurement , the mass , cooling age , and the kinematic membership of this wd can not be constrained accurately .    here we present parallax and mid - infrared photometric observations of j1102 , and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of both stars using parallax , optical , and infrared photometry .",
    "our observations are discussed in section 2 , whereas our model atmosphere analysis and the nature of these objects are discussed in section 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we obtained trigonometric parallax observations of j1102 at the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope .",
    "we used a total of 106 images taken on 13 observing runs between 2008 february and 2011 december .",
    "the instrumentation , observing protocols , and reduction techniques used were very similar to those described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for nearly all observations we used a 2048@xmath9 site ccd detector ( ` echelle ' ) at the f7.5 focus , but for the last",
    "two runs we used a 2048@xmath9 stis ccd ( ` nellie ' ) , due to problems with the echelle ccd .",

    "we took many exposures in a 4-inch wide kron - cousins @xmath13-band filter , as near to the meridian as we could to minimize differential color refraction effects .",
    "the parallax reduction and analysis pipeline was unchanged from the previous work , and the change of detectors appeared to have no effect on the results .    for j1102 , we measure a proper motion of @xmath14 mas yr@xmath7 , and a relative parallax and formal error of @xmath15 mas . using the colors and magnitudes of the reference - frame stars , and increasing the uncertainty slightly to allow for unmodeled systematics",

    "this figure shows that our observations cover a large range of parallax factor for j1102 , and the parallax is well constrained .",

    "unfortunately , wd0346 is blended with a brighter source in the irac images , which prohibits us from performing aperture photometry on it .",
    "none of these objects are detected in the wise survey @xcite .",
    "we use the state of the art wd model atmospheres to fit the available photometry for our targets .",
    "the model atmospheres include the ly-@xmath19 red wing opacity @xcite as well as non - ideal physics of dense helium that includes refraction @xcite , ionization equilibrium @xcite , and the non - ideal dissociation equilibrium of h@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we convert the magnitudes into monochromatic fluxes using the zero points derived from the vega ( stis ) spectrum integrated over the passband for each filter .",

    "regardless of these issues , wd0346 is clearly a very cool and old wd .",

    "the uncertainty in main - sequence age is larger than the range given here .",
    "however , this uncertainty is insignificant compared to the total age of the wd , which is 11.5 gyr for wd0346 .",
    "both wd0346 and j1102 are significantly older than the coolest disk wds known @xcite .      at a galactic latitude of @xmath36 ,",

    "they provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the model uncertainties in cool wd atmospheres and put the globular cluster ages on a more secure footing .",
    "our analysis shows that the current wd atmosphere models including the ly-@xmath19 opacity in the blue and the cia in the infrared provide a reasonable match to the observations , though problems most likely associated with the cia calculations remain .",
    "infrared data are essential for constraining the atmospheric composition of cool wds ( see fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
