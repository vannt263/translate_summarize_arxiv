    "given two @xmath4 functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 that satisfy laplace s equation , a complex valued harmonic function @xmath7 is defined via the combination : @xmath8 .",
    "the jacobian of such a function is given by @xmath9 .",
    "we will only consider harmonic functions that are univalent ( injective ) with positive jacobian on @xmath10 . on a simply connected domain @xmath11",
    ", a harmonic mapping @xmath7 has a canonical decomposition @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are analytic in @xmath15 , which is unique up to a constant .",
    "the dilatation @xmath16 of a harmonic map @xmath7 is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "the following theorem provides the link between harmonic univalent functions and minimal surfaces :    ( weierstrass - enneper representation ) .",
    "every regular minimal surface has locally an isothermal parametric representation of the form    @xmath18    in some domain @xmath11 , where @xmath19 is analytic and @xmath20 is meromorphic in @xmath15 , with @xmath19 vanishing only at the poles ( if any ) of @xmath20 and having a zero of precise order @xmath21 wherever @xmath20 has a pole of order @xmath22 .",
    "conversely , each such pair of functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 analytic and meromorphic , respectively , in a simply connected domain @xmath15 generate through the formulas ( [ wrep ] ) an isothermal parametric representation of a regular minimal surface .    we will use ( [ wrep ] ) in the following form :    for a harmonic function @xmath12 , define the analytic functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 by @xmath23 and @xmath24 . then the minimal surface representation ( [ wrep ] )",
    "becomes    @xmath25    see @xcite , @xcite for a further introduction to harmonic mappings .",
    "for an introduction to minimal surfaces see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be a parametrization for a surface @xmath0 immersed in @xmath1 .",
    "set @xmath27 and define @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 be the coefficients of the metric induced in @xmath1 by @xmath26 .",
    "we then have the relations    @xmath32 is notation for @xmath33 . inverting this system",
    "we find    @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    since the weierstrauss - enneper representation theorem requires that @xmath0 has an isothermal parametrization , we require @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which implies    @xmath39    the first two equations are identically satisfied . expanding the constraint on @xmath29 , and using the identity    @xmath40",
    "we find @xmath41 .",
    "defining @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , we have the cauchy riemann and isometric conditions :    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    we now proceed to calculate the symmetry group of ( [ eqone])-([eqthree ] ) . for an introduction to symmetry methods",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "preforming a symmetry analysis on a system of nonlinear equations is widely regarded as the best way to find exact solutions of the system .",
    "we will now summarize the lie method in @xcite .    consider a system of partial differential equations given by    @xmath49    with @xmath50 the set of independent variables and @xmath51 the set of dependent variables where @xmath52 run over the set of all partial derivatives of @xmath5 up to order @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and components @xmath56 , @xmath57 , we define the @xmath53-th prolongation of @xmath7 to be    @xmath58    given by @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a multi - index running over the space of all possible derivatives .",
    "for example if we consider @xmath62 , we can compute    @xmath63    the space @xmath64 is called the @xmath53-th order jet space of @xmath65 . the fundamental idea behind the method of symmetry analysis is to view @xmath66 as a map from the @xmath53-th order jet space into @xmath67 , and assuming derivative terms occur as polynomials in the system , we can identify @xmath66 with a subvariety in the jet space given by    @xmath68    now let @xmath69 be open .",
    "a symmetry group of @xmath70 is a local group of transformations @xmath31 acting on @xmath0 such that when @xmath54 solves @xmath70 , then @xmath71 solves @xmath70 for all @xmath72 where defined .",
    "let @xmath73 be a vector field on @xmath0 , and assume @xmath73 infinitesimally generates the symmetry ground @xmath31 of @xmath66 .",
    "then by projecting @xmath73 into @xmath0 via the exponential map , we may construct a local one - parameter group @xmath74 .",
    "we may then define the prolongation of @xmath73 as    @xmath75(x , u^{(n)})\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is the exponential map .",
    "we also define the jacobi matrix of @xmath66 to be    @xmath77    and say @xmath66 is maximal if the rank of @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "the following theorem constrains the form of coefficients of the @xmath53-th prolongation of an infinitesimal generator for the symmetry group .",
    "let    @xmath80    then @xmath73 has prolongation    @xmath81    where    @xmath82    where subscripts on @xmath5 indicate partial derivatives and sums over repeated indices are implicit .",
    "the following may be called the fundamental theorem of the lie method :    let @xmath66 be a system of differential equations of maximal rank . if @xmath31 is a local group of transformations acting on @xmath0 and    @xmath83=0\\ ] ]    whenever @xmath84 , for every infinitesimal generator @xmath73 of @xmath31 , then @xmath31 is a symmetry group of @xmath66 .",
    "we use these two theorems to calculate the coefficients of the infinitesimal generator .",
    "we then exponentiate the infinitesimal generator to obtain the symmetry group of the system .",
    "finally , we apply these symmetries to known and usually simple solutions of the system to obtain new and hopefully more interesting solutions .",
    "we now turn attention to ( [ eqone])-([eqthree ] ) .",
    "the infinitesimal generator of the above system is given by :    @xmath85    since the system is first order , we need only consider the first prolongation    @xmath86 @xmath87    where the @xmath88 are functions of @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "applying the first prolongation to the pde system gives the following coefficient relationships :    @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93    exponentiating these infinitesimal vector fields gives the symmetry transformations :    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    in @xcite the minimal symmetry group for the real minimal surface equation    @xmath104    was calculated .",
    "many of the translational symmetries and an @xmath105 symmetry were found .",
    "we note that the analogue of @xmath106 in @xcite is similar but different , since is constrains a weierstrauss - enneper representation of a surface and not a graph .",
    "consider the transformation @xmath107 , @xmath108 which preserves the metric @xmath109 . when @xmath110 , this is simply a minimal surface specified by defining @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath112 we get the conjugate surface .",
    "thus all intermediate surfaces , called associated surfaces , are isometric . since all minimal surfaces can be constructed from parts of a helicoid and catenoid @xcite , the following examples are of interest .",
    "first we draw attention to the catenoid , given by @xmath113 .",
    "it s conjugate surface is the helicoid and associated surfaces between the two are plotted over @xmath114 in figure [ helcat ]",
    ". since all of the associated surfaces are isometric , geometrically they are equivalent .",
    "however , note topologically the catenoid is @xmath115 where as the helicoid is @xmath116 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the other symmetries found in the analysis for the half catenoid .",
    "we see that the symmetries generate surfaces that are topologically distinct from the catenoid , but geometrically identical as in the above example .",
    "let @xmath7 be the harmonic mapping @xmath117 where @xmath118 + \\frac{z}{1 - z^2}\\bigg)\\ ] ] and @xmath119 - \\frac{z}{1 - z^2}\\bigg)\\ ] ] which lifts to the catenoid .",
    "we make the transformation in equation ( [ symlast ] ) by letting @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "figure 2 gives several plots of this transformation for various @xmath122 values .",
    "the topology of the half catenoid is @xmath116 for all @xmath122 up to some value between @xmath123 where it changes to a punctured cylinder .",
    "note as @xmath124 that the minimal surfaces eventually degenerate to a line , in a manner peculiarly similar to neckpinch singularities of the ricci flow .",
    "let @xmath125 be the helicoid over @xmath114 parameterized isothermally by + @xmath126 . for helicoids @xmath127 given by @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 by @xmath128 , @xmath131 where @xmath132 then @xmath127 and @xmath130 are locally isometric",
    ".    it would be interesting to generalize the symmetry methods of this paper to higher dimensional riemannian or lorentizian manifolds .",
    "one would need a generalized weierstrauss - enneper representation for this task .",
    "moreover , we believe there are potential topological theorems coming from symmetry ( [ symlast ] ) , which are connected to how the symmetry scales the domain of the graph under consideration . for instance , if one calculates the one parameter family of minimal surfaces given by symmetry ( [ symlast ] ) and a simply connected minimal surface , does the topology always change from the plane to @xmath133 or some variant thereof ?"
