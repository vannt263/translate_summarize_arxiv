    "the discovery and study of galaxies at @xmath9 was first made possible by the advent of deep , multi - band , near - infrared imaging provided by the installation of wfc3/ir on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) in 2009 ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2010 ; mclure et al . 2010 ; oesch et al .",
    "2010 ; finkelstein et al . 2010 ; bunker et al . 2010",
    "; see dunlop 2013 for a review ) .",
    "the initial deep studies with wfc3/ir revealed the first significant samples of galaxies at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , based on imaging through the @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 and @xmath3 filters , coupled with pre - existing deep optical imaging with acs ( to establish a lack of emission shortward of the redshifted lyman - break at @xmath15 ) . in the intervening 5 years , by combining the ultra - deep data available in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; hudf09+hudf12 ) with shallower , wider - field data from the hudf09 parallel fields , candels ( grogin et al .",
    "2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) and borg surveys ( trenti et al . 2011 ) , several different groups have reached very similar conclusions on the form of the rest - frame uv galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath10 and @xmath16 ( e.g. mclure et al . 2010 , 2013 ; oesch et al .",
    "2012b ; bradley et al .",
    "2012 ; schenker et al . 2013 ; schmidt et al . 2014 ; bouwens et al . 2015 ; finkelstein et al . 2014 ) , at least at @xmath17 ( see bowler et al . 2012 , 2014a , 2014b for new progress in the continuing debate over the form of the bright - end of the high - redshift galaxy lf ) .",
    "while a general consensus has therefore emerged over the evolving lf ( and hence uv luminosity density ) out to @xmath11 , progress at higher redshifts has , unsurprisingly , proved more difficult .",
    "the robust selection of galaxies at @xmath18 required exploitation of the additional @xmath4 filter , enabling deeper , dual - band ( @xmath19 ) detections of the rest - frame uv continuum longward of the lyman break even if the source lay beyond @xmath20 .",
    "this approach ( coupled with ultra - deep @xmath12 imaging ) was utilised in the hudf12 programme to provide the first meaningful sample of galaxies at @xmath21 ( ellis et al .",
    "2013 ; mclure et al .",
    "2013 ) and was also successfully exploited in the clash treasury programme to uncover examples of gravitationally - lensed galaxies at @xmath22 ( zheng et al .",
    "2012 ) and @xmath23 ( coe et al . 2013 ) .",
    "ellis et al . ( 2013 ) used the first robust sample of galaxies at @xmath24 uncovered from the hudf12 imaging to investigate the evolution of uv luminosity density at @xmath25 , and concluded that , although the star - formation rate density at @xmath25 appeared to fall below a simple extrapolation of the evolution seen over @xmath26 , the fall - off was less dramatic than implied by some previous studies ( i.e. bouwens et al .",
    "2011a ; oesch et al .",
    "2012a ) , and more consistent with estimates from individually lensed @xmath25 galaxies from the clash clusters survey ( e.g. zheng et al . 2012 ; coe et al .",
    "subsequently , by combining the hudf12 dataset with wider - area imaging from candels , mclure et al .",
    "( 2013 ) produced the first constraints on the @xmath27 lf ( at @xmath28 ) and used these to re - calculate the uv luminosity density .",
    "the resulting inferred star - formation rate density at @xmath18 was actually somewhat higher than derived by ellis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    however , despite this progress , the relatively small size of the @xmath0 samples , coupled with the potential for extreme field - to - field cosmic variance when sampling only the bright end of the @xmath0 galaxy uv lf ( e.g. robertson et al .",
    "2014 ) , has led to considerable debate over the amount of star formation at @xmath0 .",
    "in essence , while there is now a broad consensus that uv luminosity density declines smoothly and gradually from @xmath29 to @xmath11 , some authors have continued to argue that the available information at higher redshifts favours a rapid drop - off at @xmath0 ( e.g. oesch et al .",
    "2013 , 2014a , 2014b ) while others have argued in support of continued smooth decline ( e.g. ellis et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this , then , is the new focus of debate in the study of high - redshift galaxy evolution .",
    "it is of importance for several reasons .",
    "first , since @xmath0 is only 95myr earlier than @xmath11 , a sudden acceleration in the descent of uv luminosity density over such a relatively small amount of additional lookback time could be reasonably viewed as discovery of the ` epoch of galaxy formation ' .",
    "secondly , such a down - turn in galaxy abundance would make it more difficult for young galaxies to be the primary agent of cosmic reionization ( c.f .",
    "robertson et al 2010 , 2013 ) , unless the optical depth due to thomson scattering of the microwave background has been over - estimated ( hinshaw et al 2013 , planck collaboration 2014 ) .",
    "third , such rapid evolution might also be viewed as unexpected given the known , relatively mature properties of galaxies at @xmath10 ( dunlop et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) and theoretical predictions of early structure growth ( e.g. jaacks et al . 2012 ; kimm & cen 2013 ; paardekooper et al . 2013 ; cai et al . 2014 ; dayal et al . 2014 ; genel et al . 2014 ; henriques et al .",
    "fourth , the evolution of the galaxy population out to @xmath0 has obvious implications for the prospects of the search for and study of galaxies at even earlier times ( potentially out to @xmath30 ) with the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) from late 2018 .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that improved infomation on the prevalence of galaxies at @xmath0 is required , and thankfully , due to the continued excellent performance of wfc3/ir , this is an area in which the _ hst _ can still make an important contribution .",
    "this is one of the science drivers for the hubble frontier fields ( hff ) programme , which aims to deliver deep , near - infrared ( @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 ) data ( with associated acs optical imaging ) , over 12 wfc3/ir pointings , consisting of 6 cluster and 6 parallel fields .",
    "imaging of the first cluster field , abell-2744 , was completed in early 2014 and has been explored by several authors ( zheng et al .",
    "2014 ; zitrin et al .",
    "2014 ; ishigaki et al .",
    "2015 ; atek et al . 2015 ; oesch et al .",
    "2014b ) , while the abell-2744 parallel field has also been interrogated for high - redshift galaxies ( ishigaki et al .",
    "2015 ; oesch et al .",
    "at the time of writing , wfc3/ir+acs imaging of the second cluster field , macsj0416.1 - 240 ( previously targeted in the clash programme ; bradley et al .",
    "2014 ; bouwens et al . 2014 ) , and its associated parallel field has now also been completed .",
    "while not of the depth achieved in the hudf ( see koekemoer et al .",
    "2013 ) , these new pointings provide a large and important increase in the sky area covered with the crucial deep 4-band near - infrared imaging ( i.e. including @xmath4 ) required to robustly select galaxies at @xmath31 , and several of the aforementioned studies have reported galaxies in the abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields at these extreme redshifts . indeed , given the continued degradation of the acs , and relatively shallow nature of the hff acs optical imaging compared to the associated wfc3/ir imaging ( at least compared to the hudf ) the hff programme is arguably better optimized for the selection of galaxies at @xmath0 than at @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , while much attention has been focussed on the potential for gravitional lensing in the cluster fields to yield boosted examples of faint high - redshift galaxies beyond the limits of blank field surveys such as the hudf , it is the parallel fields that in fact provide the most valuable boost in well - understood cosmic volume for improving our knowledge of the number density of galaxies at @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the new hff data from all four of the pointings completed to date to photometrically select a new , robust sample of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath6 .",
    "we apply the tried and trusted methods developed through the hudf12 programme ( mclure et al .",
    "2013 ) , confining attention to galaxies which are sufficiently bright ( in practice @xmath1ab mag ) for the available dynamic range in the multi - colour photometry to deliver reasonably robust photometric redshifts .",
    "this approach also involves confining our attention to clean , and deep regions of the imaging ( where the local rms noise in @xmath3 as measured from @xmath32 nearby 0.5-arcsec diameter apertures is @xmath33mag ) , resulting in avoidance of the inner cluster regions , and most of the area traversed by the critical lines of high magnification .",
    "the outcome is essentially a new , blank - field survey for galaxies at @xmath0 , which complements the hudf12 project by sampling @xmath34mag shallower , but over an effective area @xmath35 times greater .",
    "we use our new sample of @xmath0 galaxies to revisit our previous estimate of the uv lf ( and hence luminosity density ) at these redshifts , and briefly explore the implications for early galaxy evolution .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the hff imaging data and briefly describe our selection methods . in section 3",
    "we present and discuss our final sample of @xmath18 galaxies .",
    "in section 4 we update our determination of the @xmath0 lf , derive the corresponding improved estimate of the integrated uv luminosity density and hence star - formation density at these redshifts , and compare with theoretical predictons .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 . throughout the paper",
    "we will refer to the following _ hst _ acs+wfc3/ir filters : f435w , f600lp , f606w , f775w , f814w , f850lp , f098 m , f105w , f110w , f125w , f140w , f160w as @xmath36 respectively .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke 1974 ; oke & gunn 1983 ) and all cosmological calculations assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 kms@xmath39mpc@xmath39 .",
    "the core dataset for this study is supplied by the public _",
    "wfc3/ir+acs imaging which has now been completed for the first two hff clusters ( abell-2744 and macsj0416.1 - 240 ) and their associated parallel fields .",
    "because the field - of - view of the acs is larger than that of wfc3 , the effective raw area of full multi - band _ hst _ coverage is equivalent to four wfc3/ir pointings , or @xmath40arcmin@xmath5 ( but see below , and section 3 for the effective survey area for @xmath0 galaxies ) . within this area , the _ hst _",
    "hff imaging provides 7-band photometry , reaching 5-@xmath41 depths of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48mag .",
    "these depths correspond to 85% of point - source flux - density , as scaled from aperture photometry measured on the hff parallel fields through 0.4-arcsec diameter apertures in the acs imaging , and apertures scaling from 0.4  0.5-arcsec diameter through the infrared ( i.e. from @xmath12 to @xmath3 ) which are designed to enclose 70% of point - source flux in each wfc3/ir band ( see below and mclure et al .",
    "the typical depth values listed here are averaged between the abell-2744 and macsj0416.1 - 240 imaging , with the former being typically 0.10.2 mag deeper in most wavebands ( due to the background ) .    because we are particularly interested here in sources which are only detectable longward of @xmath49@xmath50 m , additional information at wavelengths longer than @xmath3 is still of value , even though the available ground - based @xmath51-band imaging and _ spitzer",
    "_ irac imaging can not reach the same depths as achieved with wfc3/ir .",
    "this is because even non - detections at these longer wavelengths can help to exclude potential low - redshift interlopers , and refine high - redshift photometric redshift solutions .",
    "we have therefore made our own reductions of the deep ( @xmath52hr ) , vlt hawk - i @xmath53 observations of the hff ( hawki - ff , pi : brammer , eso programme i d 092.a-0472 ) , which provides @xmath53-band imaging across both the cluster and parallel fields , with a fwhm @xmath54 0.45arcsec , reaching a 5-@xmath41 detection depth of @xmath55mag within a 1-arcsec diameter aperture , ( which encloses @xmath56% of point - source flux ) .",
    "although the coverage is much less extensive , we also considered the gemini ao imaging of the inner regions of the hff reported by schirmer et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , which has now been completed ( 5.2 hr of exposure ) for the macsj0416.1 - 240 cluster , and reaches point - source depths of @xmath57mag .",
    "finally we have also mosaiced the available _ spitzer _ irac 3.6@xmath50 m and 4.5@xmath50 m imaging of the hff cluster and parallel fields .",
    "this provides imaging reaching a 5-@xmath41 point source detection depth of @xmath58mag , subject to the effectiveness of local source deconfusion .",
    "given the difficulties of accurately deconfusing the _ spitzer _ data , particularly in the two cluster fields , it was not included in the final sed fits , although it was utilized as a sanity check to guard against contamination from dusty low - redshift interlopers .",
    "initial photometric catalogues were produced by running sextractor 2.8.6 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in dual - image mode , using each of the wfc3/ir filters sampling long - ward of the lyman - break at @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath60 ) as the detection image .",
    "in addition , further catalogues were produced using all of the relevant stacks of the _ hst _ near - infrared data as the detection image ( i.e. @xmath61 ) .    from this initial",
    "set of six object catalogues , a master catalogue was constructed containing every unique object which was detected at @xmath62 5-@xmath41 significance in any of the detection images . for those objects which were present in multiple catalogues ,",
    "the positional information and photometry based on the highest signal - to - noise ratio detection was propagated to the master catalogue .",
    "we note that all of the final objects selected in this paper are detected at better than 5-@xmath41 in the @xmath19 stack , and all but two are detected at better that 5-@xmath41 in the @xmath3 imaging alone .",
    "a master photometry catalogue was then constructed of all unique objects , detected at @xmath63 in one of the six available catalogues , and undetected ( at @xmath64 ) in all of the acs @xmath65 , @xmath66 & @xmath67 images .          for consistency with the hudf12 analysis ,",
    "the near - infrared photometry adopted in this study is based on circular apertures , with the aperture diameter in each of the near - infrared bands tuned to enclose @xmath68% per cent of the flux - density of the filter - specific point spread function ( psf ) . with _",
    "wfc3/ir the required aperture diameters are 0.40 , 0.44 , 0.47 and 0.50arcsec for the @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 images respectively . for the photometry in the acs imaging we simply adopted an aperture diameter of 0.4arcsec for all bands , to avoid continuing to shrink the 70%-diameter apertures to the point where astrometric errors become potentially problematic for accurate photometry .",
    "for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting we then corrected all the above aperture photometry to 85%  of total point - source flux - density using the appropriate psf for each band .",
    "since the near - infrared photometric apertures have all been tuned to incorporate 70%  of point - source flux - density , the correction to 85%  of flux - density corresponds to a shift of @xmath69mag . in the acs bands",
    "this correction obviously becomes progressively larger as we move from @xmath67 to @xmath65 . in order to account for any extended flux",
    ", the total magnitudes reported in table 1 , and adopted for all subsequent luminosity function analysis , were calculated using a large ( 0.85-arcsec diameter ) circular aperture plus an additional point - source correction .",
    "finally , for completeness , we also experimented with convolving all of the _ hst _ imaging to the same resolution as the @xmath3 imaging ( using an appropriate kernel for each waveband ) before then undertaking aperture photometry in all bands with an aperture of constant diameter ( i.e. 0.5arcsec ) .",
    "the results of the sed fitting ( described below ) utilising this alternative matched - psf photometry were , in practice , indistinguishable from those obtained used the matched aperture photometry as described above .",

    "integration of this function then produces a consistent but somewhat higher estimate of uv luminosity density at @xmath0 than reported by mclure et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ( see fig.6 , and section 4.2 for details).,width=302 ]    we note that , although these two alternative fits are both acceptable , the new hff data mean that the density evolution fit is slightly favoured",
    ". continued luminosity evolution , as generally found at lower redshifts @xmath73 ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2007 ;",
    "mclure et al . 2009 ; bouwens et al . 2011b ; bowler et al .",
    "2014b ) is , however , also still clearly consistent with the available data .",
    "regardless of the precise values of the fitted schechter - function parameters , it is clear from fig.5 that nothing too dramatic occurs between @xmath11 and @xmath18 , and the galaxy uv lf continues the smooth decline witnessed over @xmath73 .",
    "this conclusion contrasts somewhat with that reached by oesch et al .",
    "( 2013 ) who reported that the @xmath0 lf lay significantly below what is ` expected ' based on continued smooth evolution . however , the sample on which oesch et al .",
    "( 2013 ) based this conclusion was significantly smaller than that reported here , and they did not have the benefit of the @xmath4 imaging which is so crucial in the selection of reliable @xmath0 galaxy samples . in any case ,",
    "examination of their binned data at @xmath0 ( shown in their figure 11 ) shows that all three of their data points are in fact clearly consistent with the new more accurate @xmath0 lf derived here .",
    "given our improved knowledge of the @xmath0 lf , it is clearly of interest to recalculate the inferred uv luminosity density , and hence star - formation rate density at @xmath0 . as described in robertson et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2013 ) the high - redshift evolution of uv luminosity density has important implications for reionization , given the apparent need for reionization to be an extended process to explain the optical - depth to thomson scattering inferred from the polarization of the microwave background ( hinshaw et al .",
    "2013 ; planck collaboration 2014 ) .",
    "it can also provide a useful and fairly straightforward test of the ability of the latest galaxy simulations to predict the early build - up of the galaxy population .",
    "therefore , in fig.6 we present the results of integrating the uv lfs shown in fig.5 to derive the high - redshift evolution of uv luminosity density , @xmath74 , and hence star - formation rate density , @xmath75 ( with the latter quantity derived assuming a salpeter imf and the uv - to - sfr conversion of madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "our new estimated value at @xmath0 is @xmath76 ( or , equivalently , @xmath77 ) if , following what has become common practice , the uv lf is integrated down to @xmath78 , equivalent to @xmath79 .",
    "this limit to the integration facilitates comparison with previous results , but is also well motivated in the current case because , as can be seen from fig.5 , it corresponds well to the faintest absolute magnitude probed directly by the available galaxy samples at @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath74 at @xmath0 inferred from the hudf12 programme was already at the higher end of the published estimates , but the result presented in fig.6 is somewhat higher still .",
    "this reflects the fact that , at least at the brighter luminosities , the udf has proved to be somewhat underdense at @xmath0 as judged against the wider area probed by the hff pointings studied here .",
    "consequently , it can be seen that our new results now strongly favour a continued smooth decline in @xmath74 between @xmath11 and @xmath0 , rather than a marked drop - off at this epoch . to help focus the debate over what happens to star - formation rate density beyond @xmath11 , oesch et al .",
    "( 2013 ) proposed that continued smooth evolution at @xmath80 could be parameterized as @xmath81 while their own results favoured a change at @xmath80 to a much steeper decline , with @xmath82 ( revised slightly to @xmath83 by oesch et al .",
    "we therefore include both these curves in the left - hand panel of fig.6 , to help clarify the comparison .",
    "our new result at @xmath0 clearly favours the shallower decline , but in fact our best fit value lies slightly below the @xmath81 extrapolation .",
    "however , it is not clear that this paramaterization provides the fairest or most appropriate baseline for judging whether high - redshift evolution is proceeding as ` expected ' .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig.6 , a better description of the smooth decline of @xmath74 from @xmath84 to @xmath0 is provided by a simple linear relation between @xmath85 and redshift , with a least - squares fit to the datapoints shown in fig.6 yielding the solid red line shown in the left - hand panel , given by the relation @xmath86 .",
    "it can also be seen that this smoothly - declining relation leads naturally on to the latest estimate of @xmath75 at @xmath87 reported by oesch et al .",
    "( 2014b ) ( based on the @xmath88 object identified by zitrin et al .",
    "2014 ) , although it does not agree well with the , albeit highly uncertain , estimate from bouwens et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , plotted as the grey open square .",
    "in addition , it can be seen from fig . 6",
    "that our derived star - formation rate density at @xmath0 is only 0.16 dex higher than that derived by ishigaki et al .",
    "they choose to describe their result as being supportive of a steep decline in @xmath75 at high redshift as proposed by oesch et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014b ) .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that the ishigaki et al .",
    "( 2015 ) results are based only on the abell-2744 hff fields , which have a significantly lower number density of @xmath89 galaxies than the macsj0416 hff fields .",
    "it is clear that our new @xmath75 determination at @xmath18 , based on the largest and most robust @xmath0 galaxy sample assembled to date , lies at the high end of pre - existing estimates . as shown by the solid red line in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "6 , our new result is in good agreement with a simple extrapolation of the evolution in @xmath75 seen at lower redshifts , and provides no evidence for a dramatic decline in @xmath75 at @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude that fig.6 now provides a convincing case that the smooth decline of @xmath75 seen from @xmath90 to @xmath11 continues to at least @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed comparison with the full range of available theoretical models / simulations of early galaxy formation / evolution is beyond the scope of the present paper , but in the right - hand panel of fig.6 we include a comparison of the observed smooth decline of uv luminosity density ( and hence sfr density ) with the predictions of six recent ( and very different ) models of galaxy formation .",
    "all of the different models have been integrated down to an effective limit of @xmath79 and corrected to a salpeter imf where necessary .",
    "it is very clear from the right - hand panel of fig.6 that , contrary to some recent reports in the literature ( e.g. oesch et al .",
    "2014b ) , the illustris model ( genel et al . 2014 ) does not reproduce the observed gentle decline of uv luminosity density very well .",
    "the data and the model predictions are in fairly good agreement at @xmath91 but at higher redshifts the model predictions descend too rapidly .",
    "it is interesting to note that this disagreement is not just relative to our new measurement at @xmath0 , but is already apparent by @xmath11 , where there is a clear consensus over the observed value .",
    "the origin of this disagreement is not clear , but we note that the illustris simulation , as is common practice , assumes a reionization history that implements a redshift - dependent uv background that is not self - consistent with the computed evolving star - formation rate density .",
    "we can speculate that this internal inconsistency and/or the specific implementation of feedback may impact on the ability of the illustris and other similar simulations to correctly predict the evolving abundance of faint galaxies at early times .",
    "it can be seen that the observed evolution of uv luminosity density is rather better produced by the semi - analytic models of cai et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and dayal et al .",
    "it should be noted that while the dayal et al .",
    "( 2014 ) model has been tuned to fit the @xmath10 uv lf , it contains only two redshift independent free parameters designed to describe the key physics of early galaxy formation as embedded within a dark - matter halo merger tree .",
    "thus it can be seen that the observed early evolution of sfr density is broadly as expected given the predicted hierarchical growth of underlying structure within the @xmath92 model . however , our new results suggest that our understanding of the baryonic physics of early galaxy growth still needs further refinement , given that globally - averaged star formation activity appears to have built up more rapidly at very early times ( @xmath93 ) than predicted in current models .",
    "as mentioned above , in constructing our luminosity function and uv luminosity density estimates , we have attempted to account for cosmic variance uncertainty owing to the luminosity - dependent spatial clustering of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we adopt the cosmic variance model described by robertson ( 2010a , b ) that utilizes abundance - matching of galaxies and dark matter halos to estimate the clustering bias of objects in our sample and calculate the combined poisson and sample variance uncertainty of the binned number counts ( see , e.g. , schenker et al .",
    "for our samples in the hff lensing clusters , we have accounted for the amplification of cosmic variance owing to the impact of magnification on the effective search area following robertson et al .",
    "the cosmic variance uncertainty in the luminosity function shown in fig.5 has been propagated through to the uncertainty in the uv luminosity density shown in fig.6 . if the abell-2744 and macs j0416.1 - 240 samples are representative of the remaining hffs , we project that the associated uncertainties may improve by as much as a factor of two in the final samples .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing the value of the hff parallel fields in this work ; these have provided the majority of the boost in survey area ( and hence cosmological volume ) for probing the brighter end of the @xmath0 lf , in effect more than trebling the area of usefully deep @xmath19 imaging over that previously provided by hudf12 .",
    "this work thus provides strong motivation for completing all six of the planned hff cluster + parallel fields , and we look forward to this being achieved in the coming years .",
    "we have completed a new search for galaxies at redshift @xmath0 in the first two hubble frontier fields for which the _ hst _ wfc3/ir and acs imaging has now been completed ( in both the cluster and parallel fields ) . to ensure robust photometric redshift solutions and to minimize incompleteness ,",
    "we have confined our search to objects with @xmath1ab mag , and have considered only the homogeneously deep regions of the imaging which have an rms noise @xmath2mag ( within a 0.5-arcsec diameter aperture ) . we have also insisted on detections in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , to ensure the selection of @xmath0 objects with a confirmed blue continuum longward of the putative redshifted lyman break .",
    "the result is a survey covering an effective area ( after accounting for magnification ) of 10.9arcmin@xmath5 , which yields 12 galaxies at @xmath6 . within the abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields",
    "we confirmed the three brightest objects reported by ishigaki et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , but have recovered only one of the four @xmath7 sources reported by zheng et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in the macsj0416.1 - 240 cluster field",
    "we have uncovered five objects , and explain why each of these eluded detection or classification as @xmath0 galaxies in the published searches of the shallower clash data . finally we have discovered four @xmath0 galaxies from within the previously unsearched macsj0416.1 - 240 parallel field .",
    "based on the published magnification maps we have deduced that only one of these 12 galaxies is likely boosted by more than a factor of two by gravitational lensing .",
    "consequently we have been able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the normalization of the @xmath0 uv galaxy luminosity function as explored previously in the hudf12 programme , and have then integrated the uv lf to derive the most accurate measurement to date of uv luminosity density ( and hence star - formation rate density ) at @xmath0 .",
    "our main conclusion is that the new data strengthen the evidence for a continued smooth decline in uv luminosity density ( and hence star - formation rate density ) from @xmath11 to @xmath0 , contrary to recent reports of a marked drop - off at these redshifts .",
    "this result alleviates concerns that such a rapid down - turn in early star formation would present significant obstacles for the conclusion that high - redshift galaxies provided the bulk of the ultraviolet photons required to produce and maintain cosmic reionization .",
    "finally we find that the observed decline of star - formation rate density with increasing redshift over @xmath94 is significantly more gradual than predicted by some of the latest theoretical simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. genel et al .",
    "2014 ; henriques et al .",
    "whatever the origin of this discrepancy , our results indicate that galaxy evolution , and hence globally - averaged star formation activity builds up more rapidly at very early times ( @xmath93 ) that predicted in current models .",
