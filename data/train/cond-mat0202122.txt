    "various types of systems display peculiar properties due to competing long - range forces . in this paper",
    "we focus on the statistical properties of charged interfaces , in ising - like systems , such as aggregates of charged topological defects in charge - density wave systems @xcite and among them polyacetylene @xcite , charged domain - lines in uniaxial ferroelectrics @xcite or stripes in oxides @xcite .",
    "instabilities , such as the observed inclination of stripes in cuprates @xcite and manganese @xcite , might be related to the presence of the long range coulomb interactions and its competition with an attractive force .",
    "uniaxial ferroelectrics and density waves are also model systems where such instabilities could take place .",
    "the present study deals with one or two - dimensional charged interfaces , i.e. strings or walls .",
    "the former is realized in oxides , monolayers of doped conducting polymers or other charge - density waves and junctions in field effect experiments @xcite for equivalent materials .",
    "the latter might be present , due to a dimensional crossover which induces a @xmath0 ordering , in the systems cited above .",
    "the above interests emerged from a model - independent theory concerning the statistical and thermodynamic properties of uncharged and charged solitons which has been studied , respectively , in refs .   and  .",
    "the system considered is two - fold degenerate and , when topologically doped , the solitons form a one - component plasma in either @xmath1 or @xmath0 space .",
    "the competition between the long - range @xmath0 coulomb interaction of the particles and the confinement force between them has led to a very rich phase diagram .",
    "particularly interesting was the regime where the temperature is much less than the confinement energy scale , so that the solitons are actually bound into pairs , and the repulsive coulomb interaction is weak enough to preserve these bisolitons as the elementary particles . in this regime ,",
    "aggregated phases of bisolitons were shown to exist .",
    "the study of such aggregates in the continuum limit is equivalent to the study of charged interfaces .",
    "the statistical properties of charged fluctuating manifolds have been considered before @xcite . in this study , the authors have been considering a generalization of the theory of polyelectrolytes , cf . ref .  , and have been focusing on the properties emerging from scale invariance and renormalization .",
    "even though some of our results will converge with the previous study , which seems to be quite natural , our aim will be different .",
    "we consider interfaces directed along an anisotropy axis of the system which are either in an elastic or confinement regime ; the latter is relevant to quasi - one dimensional systems in relation with the statistical properties of solitons mentioned above . in both regimes",
    "the coulomb interaction favors the disintegration of the interface .",
    "in contrast with the instability towards a modulation which has been suggested in ref .   this competition , as we will show , leads to _ zero - temperature shape instabilities _ with respect to a _ tilting _ of the interface .",
    "we will focus mainly on the properties related to this discrete symmetry breaking .",
    "this will able us to better understand the structure of the solitonic lattice in the presence of the long range repulsive interaction . in this respect , and as explained in @xcite , even though this problem seems to be quite old , the detailed impact of the coulomb interaction has not been reported before .",
    "moreover , the charged solitonic lattice is commonly observed nowadays as stripes in various oxides .",
    "experimentally the observation that upon doping the system , at low temperatures , a transition from a collinear , i.e. vertical , to a diagonal stripe phase takes place @xcite is strikingly similar to our actual results .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the statistical properties of a charged string . in section [ presentation ]",
    "we present the models of the confined and elastic charged strings . in section [ zerotemp ]",
    "we derive the statistical properties of the string with the help of a saddle - point calculation .",
    "we present the zero - temperature results dealing with the instabilities of the string . in section [ finitetemp ]",
    "the effects of thermal fluctuations are considered . in section [ numerics ] the previous results",
    "are confirmed with the help of a numerical approach . in section [ applications ]",
    "the present study is applied to the @xmath2 and @xmath0 solitonic lattices , as well as stripes and uniaxial ferroelectrics .",
    "the problem of the charged string @xcite has emerged from the study of the statistical properties of topological defects , i.e. solitons , common to charge density wave ( cdw ) systems .",
    "these general arguments are reproduced in the following as they give a full meaning to the physical origins of the present theory , cf .",
    "@xcite for a review on the physics of topological defects in cdw systems .",
    "it should however be clear that this study is also relevant to other systems with discrete symmetry breaking as has been mentioned already in the introduction .    for the moment we consider a one - dimensional system , i.e. a single chain , in a cdw state .",
    "the latter is described by a lattice order parameter which is complex in general @xmath3 where @xmath4 runs along the chain , @xmath5 is related to the cdw gap and @xmath6 fixes the position of the cdw with respect to a host lattice . in",
    "weakly commensurate cdw the low energy excitations are excitations of the phase .",
    "this leads , cf .",
    "@xcite , to a sine - gordon type hamiltonian @xmath7 where the first term gives the elastic energy of the cdw and the second term reflects the pinning of the cdw superstructure by the host lattice ; @xmath8 is the degeneracy of the ground - state .",
    "the non - trivial solutions of the equation of motion associated with ( [ sinegordon ] ) are the solitons , i.e. the @xmath9particles @xcite , which may be viewed as compressions or dilatations of the cdw",
    ". as we are in the realm of electronic crystals the solitons might therefore carry a charge which is fractional , i.e. @xmath10 , in the general case . for a double - degenerate ground state ,",
    "@xmath11 , they are given by @xmath12 where the length @xmath13 corresponds to the width of this nucleus domain wall connecting the two ground states @xmath14 .",
    "the situation is slightly different for the two - fold degenerate trans - polyacetylene because in this case the band is half - filled and the system is commensurate . in particular equation ( [ sinegordon ] ) does not describe this case .",
    "however the previous arguments remain qualitatively the same .",
    "the defect is an amplitude or @xmath15soliton ; it carries an integer charge and is described by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant deformation of the chains . again",
    "this excitation connects the two ground states of the system @xmath18 .    for a quasi - one - dimensional system , which we consider here",
    ", neighboring chains must have the same phase modulo @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to the following general two - particle interaction @xmath20 between neighboring chains @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with coupling constant @xmath23 , and solitons distant by @xmath24 . in",
    "the coarse - grained regime , @xmath25 , ( [ interchainint ] ) grows linearly , @xmath26 , a signature of the confinement of the defects .",
    "this can be shown explicitly with the help of ( [ sshsoliton ] ) and ( [ interchainint ] ) . dealing with a string , e.g. a domain line of solitons",
    ", this confinement energy is equivalently reproduced by the solid on solid ( sos ) model .",
    "the related hamiltonian reads @xmath27 where we have taken @xmath28 as the inter - chain energy scale , @xmath29 runs along the vertical direction and @xmath30 is an integer variable giving the deviation of the string with respect to the @xmath29 axis .    the opposite case , corresponding to small deviations @xmath31 , is more general for the energy then increases quadratically @xmath32 .",
    "this is equivalent to the elastic model which is extensively used in interface physics .",
    "the related hamiltonian reads @xmath33 these two interface models are well known @xcite . to compactify notations",
    "we shall define @xmath34 where @xmath35 leading respectively to the confinement and elastic regimes and where the continuum limit has been taken in both cases .",
    "we thus see that a crossover ( corresponding to fractional @xmath36 ) from the elastic to the confinement regime takes place as the distance between solitons increases , i.e. as the tilt angle of the string increases .",
    "this is manifested by the fact that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is related to the tilt angle of the string and @xmath39 is the inter - chain distance . for @xmath40",
    "the string is elastic whereas for @xmath41 the confined string is relevant .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes takes place at @xmath42 the introduction of the @xmath0 long - range coulomb interaction yields",
    "@xmath43    where @xmath44 so that the elementary constituent of the string might carry a fractional charge @xmath45 ( @xmath46 for polyacetylene ) , @xmath47 is the dielectric constant of the isotropic , neutral media in which the plane is embedded and the contribution of the vertical string has been subtracted .",
    "the thermodynamics of the charged interface is governed by @xmath48 or explicitly    @xmath49",
    "we consider a configuration @xmath50 were @xmath51 has been expanded in the vicinity of the saddle point distribution @xmath52 with deviations @xmath53 .",
    "free boundary conditions are taken .",
    "the expanded hamiltonian reads , in the harmonic approximation    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is given by ( [ tothamexplicit ] ) and @xmath56 .",
    "the saddle point distribution is given by @xmath57 that is    @xmath58    this non - linear integro - differential equation can not be solved exactly .",
    "we will therefore take an ansatz for the ground - state configuration @xmath52 of the string .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ tothamexplicit ] ) , at zero temperature , the elastic or confinement term favors a vertical string , i.e. along the @xmath29 axis , whereas the coulomb favors the disintegration of the string in the perpendicular direction .",
    "instabilities of the string arise from the competition between these interactions .",
    "_ we find that these instabilities lead to a tilted string as the new ground state of the system_. therefore @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the tilt angle of the string with respect to the @xmath29 axis .",
    "this ansatz satisfies the linearized equation ( [ eamotexplicit ] ) up to some logarithmic corrections . as will be shown explicitly in the following , @xmath38 is related to the ratio between the coulomb and confinement or elastic energy scales .",
    "it is thus related to the elementary charge of the string constituent soliton .    with the help of ( [ disttilted0 ] ) , and",

    "the results for the confinement regime are qualitatively the same as for the elastic one .",
    "the present study should be connected , as has been said in the introduction , to the previous work on the statistical properties of solitons .",
    "above , we have been considering the domain - line as given .",
    "actually , in quasi - one dimensional systems , it has been shown in @xcite , with the help of a mapping to the ferromagnetic ising model , that there are no strings , i.e. infinite domain lines of solitons , at non - zero temperature .",
    "the latter emerge from a process of exponential growth of aggregates of bisolitons below a crossover temperature @xmath175 . in the non - interacting case , @xmath176 and the aggregates are finite rods perpendicular to the chains of the quasi - one dimensional system . at zero temperature",
    "the rods cross the whole system forming the free domain lines of solitons . in the interacting case",

    "take place in order for the bisolitons to aggregate , cf .",
    "this is due to the important size - charging energy of the aggregates .",
    "a crucial approximation is that we have been neglecting shape instabilities in the interacting case .",
    "this reduced us to the region of the phase diagram where @xmath178 , cf .",
    "( [ gammacriticgauss ] ) . at high coupling constants , @xmath179 ,",
    "strings at @xmath117 , or aggregates at finite temperatures should melt into a wigner crystal of solitons . at intermediate coupling constants",
    "the present theory , dealing with shape instabilities should be relevant . it should be noted that in the previous paper we have suggested that shape instabilities give rise to a modulated string which would correspond to a single negative mode ; as we have shown , the instability at intermediate coupling constant , is towards a tilt of the interface and affects a continuous set of modes .",
    "we will first seek the stability of the string phase with respect to the wigner crystal of solitons at @xmath117 .",
    "then we will concentrate on the non - zero temperature regime and look for the shape of the aggregates of solitons which lead to strings . to make comparison with the previous paper easier ,",
    "notice that the present coupling constant , @xmath180 , is similar to the coupling constant used in the previous paper @xmath181 .",
    "otherwise we have tried to preserve the same notations .",
    "we define @xmath182 as the coupling constant above which strings melt into a wigner crystal at @xmath117 .",
    "we would like to check here that @xmath183 in order to preserve the coherence of the arguments .    as the coulomb interaction increases , the string of solitons tilts .",
    "it s energy also increases .",
    "this leads to a dissociation of the string as soon as it s energy per soliton @xmath184 becomes larger than the energy of the constituent soliton @xmath185 .",
    "the latter corresponds to @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the radius of the wigner seitz cell including the soliton and a background charge of density @xmath188 with @xmath189 .",

    "thus @xmath192 increases from negative values .",
    "the melting of the string is given by @xmath193 and , @xmath38 being the optimal angle of the string , ( [ sossol ] ) . starting with @xmath194 in @xmath193 , ( [ sossol ] ) leads to the boundary @xmath195 , in contradiction with the starting hypothesis . on the other hand , starting with @xmath196 leads to the lowest boundary @xmath197 , cf .",

    "the tilted phase might thus be observed when this condition is satisfied .",
    "more exotic is the non zero temperature case . from the point of view of interfaces , the latter roughen and",

    "equivalently , from the point of view of solitons there are no infinite lines but finite size aggregates .",
    "the size of the aggregates is approximately given by the distance between two successive collision points of neighboring interfaces .",
    "we address here the question of the shape of the charged aggregates of solitons in the intermediate regime where @xmath201 .",

    "an inclined aggregate , as in figure [ shapes ] c ) , would thus be more favorable than the straight rod .",
    "but at finite temperature angular kinks are present and they further reduce the coulomb energy .",
    "we can shown that a droplet with the lozenge shape of figure [ shapes ] b ) is favored in comparison with the previous aggregates .",

    "details are given in the text.,width=283,height=226 ]      we consider briefly the important case of three dimensional systems where interfaces are domain walls . in @xmath0",
    "some rigorous statements allow a good understanding of the uncharged case in the frame of quasi - one dimensional systems , cf . @xcite . in the presence of coulomb interactions",
    "we shall thus follow @xcite as well as our present experience of the charged @xmath2 case .",
    "concerning notations , in the third direction , @xmath215 , the coupling constant will be taken as @xmath216 and the unit length as @xmath217 .      for the non - interacting case it has been shown in @xcite that peculiarities are brought by the raise of dimensionality . in @xmath0 the excitations analogous to rods would be disc - like objects .",
    "however , rigorous statements concerning the @xmath0 case show that , at a temperature @xmath218 , a density @xmath219 of solitons condense into infinite anti - phase domain walls perpendicular to the chains of the quasi - one dimensional system ; @xmath220 then corresponds to the density of finite size solitons below @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , the crossover regime of growing rods , which took place below @xmath177 in @xmath2 , can not take place in @xmath0 and is replaced by the transition at @xmath221 .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations on the walls is well known .",
    "several authors have shown ( see references in @xcite ) that , in @xmath0 the hight - hight correlation function remains finite at @xmath222 whereas it diverges logarithmically for @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the roughening temperature . from these considerations @xmath221 may be considered as the roughening temperature . the existence of walls in @xmath0 at finite temperatures is compatible with the fact that in ising - like systems there is @xmath2 long - range order at low temperatures .",
    "the three - dimensional case of charged walls can be treaded the same way as the two - dimensional case .",
    "we will therefore consider again the elastic and confinement regimes .",
    "the coulomb interaction will lead to a tilting of the wall here too .",
    "two tilt angles can be defined now , because the anisotropy axis becomes an anisotropy plane .",
    "we will thus consider @xmath225 which corresponds to the previous , in plane , tilt angle and @xmath226 which is the tilt angle with respect to the third direction .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian of the system is then    @xmath227\\ ] ]    where , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 and in the last term , the contribution of the straight domain wall has been substracted .",
    "notice that it is only in the case where @xmath231 that we gain a global factor @xmath232 as in the @xmath2 case .",
    "the logarithm is therefore the signature of a non - homogeneous charge dilatation within the wall .",
    "our aim is to determine the phase diagram , @xmath233 versus @xmath234 in both regimes , i.e. @xmath235 . among the four possible cases we will consider only the full elastic ( @xmath236 ) and mixed ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 ) regimes .    in the elastic regime , @xmath236 ,",
    "the phase diagram is displayed on figure [ wall elastic ] . for @xmath239 ,",
    "the stable solution is given by @xmath240 in the region @xmath241 , the stable solution corresponds to @xmath242 for @xmath243 a third phase , corresponding to @xmath244 is stable .",
    "the domain of validity of this solution overlaps the ones of the two previous solutions . with the help of energetic considerations , we find that a line of first order critical points , at @xmath245 , separates phase ( [ phase00 ] ) from phase ( [ phasey0 ] ) . by the same way , a line of first order critical points has been found to separate phase ( ) from phase ( [ phasey0 ] ) .",
    "the line @xmath246 is a line of second order critical points which terminates at the critical end - point @xmath247 , @xmath248 .",
    "phases which would have both angles none - zero appeared to be unstable .",
    "phase diagram of the elastic wall : @xmath249 as a function of @xmath250.,width=283,height=226 ]    a similar analysis can be done for quasi - two dimensional ( @xmath251 ) systems where the interface is elastic within the planes , i.e. @xmath237 and in the confinement regime between planes , i.e. @xmath238 . for @xmath251 systems , the coupling in the third direction is weak with respect to the coupling in other directions , i.e. @xmath252 . in the region of the phase diagram where @xmath252 the solution is thus given by @xmath253 and is stable for @xmath239 .",
    "as before , when @xmath241 , the untilted solution is stable for small @xmath234 and is separated from the previous by a line of second order critical points . from ( [ phase0z ] ) and ( [ confintangle ] ) , we see that for a given value of the ratio @xmath254 , the tilt is stronger in the mixed regime than in the pure elastic regime .",
    "this can be interpreted by considering the equilibrium position of a constituent of the wall due to the constant confinement force and the constant electric force due to the charged wall ; a priori , the equilibrium is reached only at @xmath255 , a feature which is peculiar to the confinement regime .",
    "this implies that the wall should melt as soon as @xmath256 _ or , _ if the coulomb energy scale is sufficiently weak , that the wall should strongly incline to reduce the coupling constant .",
    "allowing the wall to tilt , the equilibrium equation , @xmath255 , is generalized to @xmath257 which leads to the following minimal stability angle @xmath258 above which the wall stabilizes at the equilibrium angle ( [ confintangle ] ) .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "the situation is thus richer than in the @xmath2 case with the appearance of a tricritical point and quantitative differences between the various regimes but , qualitatively , the same phase diagram for all of them .",
    "in particular , the tilting of the interface takes place with respect to a single anisotropy axis and not both . in quasi - two dimensional systems ,",
    "the wall should tilt with respect to the third direction rather than @xmath259direction and the tilting is stronger in the confinement regime to prevent the melting .",
    "another difference with the @xmath2 case is that thermal fluctuations do not affect these results , as long as we are below the roughening temperature of the wall .",
    "up to know the whole theory is model independent . as we have already mentioned our results could be applied to doubly commensurate charge - density waves such as polyacetylene .",
    "we will however consider physical systems which are quite extensively studied nowadays .",
    "these are the oxides , e.g. cuprate , nickelate , manganese and the new ferroelectric state .",
    "the latter will be considered in the next section .",
    "we will focus here on the phenomenology of stripes with the help of the above theory .",
    "we concentrate only on the long distance properties , namely , the fact that stripes consist of lines or walls of holons which are similar to the charged solitons we have been considering .",
    "the latter are thus charged interfaces as the ones described in this paper .",
    "the oxides we consider are quasi - two dimensional materials formed by coupled planes . at intermediate values of doping , a @xmath0 ordering of the stripes",
    "might have been seen in @xmath260 and @xmath261 , cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the impact of the pinning by the lattice and the coulomb interactions play a crucial role in these systems .    in @xmath260 neutron diffraction studies have revealed diffuse magnetic peaks along the @xmath215-direction , in the stripe phase , which is consistent with stripes as one - dimensional interfaces .",
    "moreover , @xmath262-ray studies reveal that stripes are parallel in next - nearest - neighboring layers but orthogonal between nearest layers .",
    "this @xmath0 ordering is probably due to a pinning of the stripes by the lattice structure .",
    "the case of nickelates is more interesting . in @xmath261",
    "there is a body - centered stacking of parallel elastic stripes with only weak perturbations due to the lattice .",
    "this @xmath0 ordering is due to coulomb repulsion and might correspond to a domain wall with a step - like profile suggesting a confinement regime in the third direction .",
    "this justifies the mixed confinement - elastic regime we have considered in [ 3dcase ] .",
    "experimental results do not however exclude the interpretation of this @xmath0 ordering as a wigner crystal of lines .",
    "the latter hypothesis allows us to focus on strings within planes of the quasi - two dimensional system , as we are going to do in the next paragraph .    following wakimoto & al @xcite",
    ", we are going to recall briefly here some experimental results related to the tilting of string - like stripes in @xmath263 .",
    "the experimental results are summarized on figure [ cuprate ] which has been taken from @xcite . in figure [ cuprate ]",
    "( a ) , @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the distance between stripes . at low doping ,",
    "the inset on the left of this figure , shows magnetic bragg peaks corresponding to a one - dimensional spin modulation which is inclined with respect to the reference tetragonal axis . at higher doping",
    ", the inset on the left , shows that this spin modulation , along with the charge stripes , have rotated by an angle of @xmath266 degrees .",
    "the main figure , together with figure [ cuprate ] ( b ) which displays the tilt angle as a function of the concentration of dopant , show that this shape instability takes place around @xmath267 where @xmath268 increases linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the authors report a weak dependence of the magnetic peaks on the third direction .",
    "this implies that the spin modulations are weakly correlated between successive @xmath269 layers .",
    "thus , the stripes can be considered with a good accuracy as charged strings which justifies our starting hypothesis .",
    "the stripe instability observed experimentally might be due to the competition between the long - range coulomb interaction and an anisotropic interaction . to relate this instability to an increase of the concentration of dopants @xmath4 we should probably take into account structural changes .",
    "as argued by tranquada & al @xcite , the lines of charge might be pinned along the direction of the tilt of the @xmath270 octahedron .",
    "this tilt direction varies with doping .",
    "it is along the orthorhombic axis at low doping and along the tetragonal axis at higher doping .",
    "these axis are @xmath266 degrees from each - other . at an intermediate doping ,",
    "corresponding to the critical value @xmath271 , a @xmath266 degrees tilt of the stripes , satisfying the structural constraints , can take place .",
    "simple considerations related to the competing energy scales are in favor of such an order of magnitude for the tilt angle .",
    "first , in this system @xmath272 where @xmath273 is a unit length of the tetragonal structure .",
    "second the exchange energy @xmath165 is of the order of @xmath274 .",
    "thus @xmath275 where ( [ gamma0 ] ) has been used .",
    "if we consider that the debye length is of the order of the inter - stripe distance @xmath276 , at the transition @xmath271 we have @xmath277",
    ". thus @xmath278 . using ( [ xiopt2 ] ) ,",
    "the maximum tilt angle compatible with these values is around @xmath279 degrees .",
    "a tilt angle of @xmath266 degrees can be reached with a @xmath280 which is clearly in the range of allowed values above .",
    "hence , the competing interactions can be responsible for such a tilt .",
    "this tilt could reduce the electrostatic energy of the stripe as can be seen by the following argument . at low doping ,",
    "i.e. in the diagonal stripe phase , the hole concentration along the stripe is @xmath281 hole / cu .",
    "this concentration is reduced to @xmath282 hole / cu in the collinear stripe phase , cf .",
    "wakimoto & al .",
    "the density of charges along the stripe is thus reduced by @xmath283 , with @xmath284 for the present @xmath266 degrees tilt angle .",
    "this dilatation factor reduces the electrostatic energy of the string as has already been seen in ( [ mffreeen ] ) .",
    "this could hold assuming that the number of holes@xmath285stripe is constant .",
    "the added dopants would lead to the formation of new stripes .",
    "the latter become tightly packed at high doping as suggested by the linear relation @xmath286 .",
    "tilting of stripes in a cuprate oxide ( from @xcite).,width=264,height=264 ]      recently a ferroelectric mott - hubbard state has been observed in quasi 1d organic superconductors such as @xmath287 .",
    "we give a brief account on the origin of this phase and connect the results to our present study .",
    "experimental and theoretical results are given in detail in @xcite .",
    "in the system mentioned above @xmath288 are molecules composing the stacks and therefore giving rise to the one dimensional nature of the compound .",
    "@xmath262 are ions placed in the vicinity of the molecules . at large temperatures , of the order of @xmath289 ,",
    "the ions reorder through a uniform shift which gives rise to a ferroelectric phase .",
    "the latter has been detected via the measurement of the dielectric susceptibility which shows a gigantic anomaly at low frequency around @xmath290 . at low temperature domain lines , separating domains with opposite polarization , should be observed .",
    "their existence is necessary to minimize the external electric field generated by charges accumulating at the boundary of the sample .",
    "moreover , as the interface corresponds to a jump in the polarization it is charged .",
    "following @xcite we shall define as @xmath291solitons the elementary constituents of the interface which connect domains with opposite polarization .",
    "they carry a fractional charge @xmath45 with @xmath292 .",
    "two facts suggest that this system is a good candidate for the observation of charged interfaces .",
    "first the background dielectric susceptibility @xmath293 is large .",
    "further more @xmath15solitons are also present and they screen the coulomb interaction .",
    "this weakens the coulomb interaction .",
    "in such systems , the strings of @xmath291solitons should thus be stable against a melting towards a wigner crystal .",
    "bubble - like aggregates of @xmath291solitons , as the ones described in [ applications ] , could also be observed at higher temperatures .",
    "the statistical properties of charged interfaces , strings and walls , has been studied .",
    "we have found that shape instabilities , due to competing interactions , play a fundamental role .",
    "they manifest themselves through zero - temperature phase transitions from which new ground - states emerge where the interface is tilted . the @xmath2 case of the string has been extensively studied . for small tilt angles",
    "the string is elastic and the transition to the tilted ground state is second order . on the other hand",
    "a first order transition takes place if we are beyond the limit of validity of the elastic regime , i.e. in the confinement regime . at non - zero temperatures",
    "it has been shown that in either regimes a pure coulomb roughening of the string , due to the proliferation of angular - bikinks , exists in addition to the usual roughening as soon as @xmath294 . at higher temperatures angular - kinks",
    "are thermally activated and connect the degenerate ground - states .",
    "these results have been confirmed with the help of a numerical approach based on the monte carlo - metropolis algorithm .",
    "we have then related the present study to the general problem of the statistical properties of solitons in charge - density wave systems in either @xmath1 or @xmath295 dimensions . in @xmath2 systems",
    "the string has been shown to emerge from lozenge - like aggregates of solitons upon decreasing temperature . in @xmath0 , the additional coupling constant in the third direction",
    "enriches the tilted phases with the appearance of a tricritical point separating them . in the confinement regime , a disintegration of the wall is favored but the solitons might order in the form of a strongly inclined wall .",
    "applications concerning stripes in oxides and a possible explanation of their tilt , as well as charged strings in uniaxial ferroelectric experiments , have also been considered .",

    "i would like to thank a. bishop for discussions and his hospitality at the theoretical division and center of non - linear studies , of los alamos .",
    "in this appendix we give some details on the screening in the ensemble of solitons .",
    "screening makes the energy extensive and gives a meaning to the thermodynamic limit as has been said all along the paper . in the following",
    "we will work in the rpa approximation which is very well known in the field on many - body theory .",
    "this allows us to derive the debye length and the electrostatic potential in two cases : two and three - dimensional screening .",
    "we consider first a single plane embedded in @xmath0 space .",
    "this case corresponds to two - dimensional screening .",

    "the first term on the right of ( [ general poisson ] ) corresponds to the screening charge .",

    "this leads to an algebraic screening instead of the exponential one , cf .",

    "we consider now the three dimensional case of independent planes embedded in a neutral media .",
    "such a system of decoupled planes brings a @xmath312screening .",
    "the screening charge is then a function of the three - dimensional vector @xmath298 .",
    "but , as the planes are independent , the bare correlation function corresponds to @xmath313 . by the same arguments as in the first section we can compute the coulomb field which reads @xmath314 where we consider only the @xmath300 plane subject to the bulk screening .",
    "the three - dimensional debye length is then given by @xmath315 where @xmath217 is the inter - plane distance .",
    "in real space ( [ 3dcoulomb ] ) leads to the usual exponential screening .",
