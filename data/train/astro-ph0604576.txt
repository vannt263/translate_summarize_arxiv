    "determining the mass - density profiles of galactic dark matter halos has been an exciting , yet contentious , field for a number of years now .",
    "though it is widely agreed that low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are dark matter dominated down to small radii @xcite and , hence , are ideal test subjects for studying the dark matter distribution , a consensus on the interpretation of their rotation curves has been difficult to achieve .",
    "the disagreement arises when comparing the data to numerical simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the most common description of cdm halo behavior is given by the analytic approximation of @xcite and is known as the nfw profile .",
    "the cosmologically motivated nfw halo is characterized by a mass - density that rises very steeply toward the center , a property which makes the halo `` cuspy '' .",
    "cuspy halos that rise more steeply than the nfw halo have also been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whether or not the dark matter halos of lsb galaxies can be described by cuspy nfw - like profiles has been a matter of debate .",
    "nfw halos can be fit to the observations , but the fits are usually of lower quality than fits with pseudo - isothermal halos",
    ". moreover , the implied cosmological parameters are inconsistent with the standard @xmath0cdm picture .",
    "in particular , the observed concentrations of the nfw halos are too low @xcite .",
    "much better fits to lsb observations are found when using the pseudo - isothermal halo model ( simon et al .",

    "these halos have a mass - density that remains at an approximately constant value toward the center , thus they are referred to as `` cored '' halos . unlike the nfw profile , however , the pseudo - isothermal halo has no cosmological motivation or theoretical basis .    in its favor",
    ", the cdm model has been successful on large scales in explaining structure formation in the early universe as well as abundances of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "it is more appealing to have a halo model with explanations rooted in cosmology rather than a model that is simply a convenient fit to the data .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that a number of reasons have been given in an attempt to salvage the appropriateness of the nfw profile as a description of galactic dark matter halos .",

    "low spatial resolution ( i.e. , beam smearing ) was suggested to be a systematic effect that would erroneously indicate cores @xcite .",
    "the question of beam smearing was addressed by long - slit  observations which had an order of magnitude increase in spatial resolution [ see for example , mcgaugh , rubin , & de blok 2001 ( hereafter mrb01 ) ; bmr01 ] ; cusps did not appear when the resolution was increased , showing that beam smearing had been of only minor importance in the hi  observations .",

    "if the slit misses the dynamical center of the galaxy , or if there are non - circular motions from , for instance , a bar , the circular velocity may be underestimated and lead to the false inference of a cored halo .",
    "@xcite conducted extensive modeling in which the rotation curves of both cuspy and cored halos were subjected to various effects and concluded that no systematic effect will entirely mask the presence of a cuspy halo for realistic observing conditions .",
    "@xcite performed a similar exercise with similar results , but argued that it might still be possible to retain cuspy halos .",
    "clearly there are a number of issues which new observations must simultaneously address .",
    "the data must be both high resolution and two - dimensional in nature .",
    "observations must have resolution @xmath5 1 kpc as that is the critical length scale at which the distinction between cusps and cores can be determined @xcite .",
    "any non - circular motions should be readily identifiable in a two - dimensional velocity field .",

    "the minimum disk assumption is considered applicable to those galaxies which require substantial amounts of dark matter at small radii even in the maximum disk model .",
    "we then expanded our sample to include other lsb galaxies that nearly made the `` clean '' cut .",

    "the two exposures per pointing were combined to increase the signal - to - noise and to remove cosmic rays .",

    "the average error on individual emission line velocities due to centroiding accuracy was roughly 1.5 km s@xmath10 .",

    "the maximum difference between the measured velocities and the mean was taken to be the error on the fiber velocity .",

    "specifically , rotcur does a non - linear least squares fit to the following equation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21    the observed velocity at position @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is a function of the systemic velocity ( @xmath24 ) , the rotation velocity ( @xmath25 ) , the inclination ( @xmath26 ) , the position of the center of rotation ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) , and the position angle ( @xmath29 ) of the major axis .",
    "the position angle is defined as the angle between north and the receding side of the major axis , measured from north through east .",

    "the  data cover the centers of the galaxies .",
    "we find these to be in the regime of solid - body rotation .",
    "consequently , neither the center nor the inclination could be determined by the observations .",
    "the center was therefore fixed to the position of the optical center and the inclination was fixed to published values ( bmr01 ; bb02 ; tully 1988 ) .",
    "the systemic velocities were determined by rotcur .",
    "we also used rotcur to determine the position angle of the major axis , using published long - slit values as the initial guess .",
    "if the position angle could not be well - constrained by rotcur , then it was fixed to the long - slit value .",
    "the long - slit position angles are generally from either the hivelocity field or the surface photometry , or in some cases , are the position angles indicated in a catalog such as the ugc @xcite .",
    "only two galaxies , ugc 477 and ugc 1281 , had position angles well - constrained by rotcur .",
    "ring radii were set to the effective fiber resolution for each galaxy .",
    "the resulting rotation curve was inspected for rings with considerably higher or lower velocities than neighboring rings .",
    "these highly deviant points in the rotation curve were investigated and were usually attributable to a single fiber in the ring having an extreme velocity .",
    "these extreme fibers were removed and the rotation curve was recalculated .",
    "lastly , we added in quadrature to the errorbars on the final rotation curve the velocity error from centroiding accuracy corrected for inclination .",
    "we do not impose a minimum error on the rotation curve points , as was the case in some previous works ( eg .",
    "5 km s@xmath10  in @xcite and 4 km s@xmath10  in ) .",
    "the nature of the errors on the rotation curve points from the velocity fields is different from the errors on long - slit rotation curves . in the long - slit case ,",
    "the error is on a single velocity measurement and gives the accuracy with which a gaussian could be fitted to an emission line profile , or the error is given by the consistency of the observed emission lines ( , [ ] @xmath166584 , [ ] @xmath166717  and [ ] @xmath166731 ) .",
    "the error does not contain information about the uncertainty in the rotation velocity .",
    "errors can become arbitrarily small in high signal - to - noise data and is the reason why minimum errors were imposed . in two - dimensional data ,",
    "the rotation velocity is obtained from a tilted ring fit .",
    "the error indicates something about the spread of the velocities in a ring . in this case",
    ", a smaller error indicates that the gas in the ring has smaller non - circular motions .",

    "two of the most prominent competing dark matter halo density profiles are the pseudo - isothermal halo and the nfw profile .",

    "it predicts the same functional behavior for cdm halos of galaxy clusters as for the cdm halo of a single galaxy .",
    "the nfw mass - density distribution is described as @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is related to the density of the universe at the time of halo collapse , and @xmath50 is the characteristic radius of the halo .",

    "@xmath53 is the radius at which the density contrast exceeds 200 , roughly the virial radius .",
    "@xmath56 is the circular velocity at @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , there are other cuspy halo models with slopes steeper than the nfw profile .",
    "the nfw profile thus serves as a lower limit to the slope of cuspy density profiles and as such , gives the cuspy halo the best possible chance to fit the data . from an observational perspective , there is very little to distinguish the various flavors of cuspy halos .      in this section",
    "we combine the  data with the previous smoothed long - slit  and hi  rotation curves when available .",
    "for the ten galaxies with long - slit and/or hi  data , we supplement the  data with the entire long - slit rotation curve , and include only those hi  points which extend beyond the radial range of both the  and long - slit data . using only the outer hi  points where",
    "the rotation curves have usually begun to flatten lessens possible resolution effects . as discussed below , there are three galaxies , f563 - 1 , f583 - 4 and ugc 4325 , for which we exclude some of the  and/or hi  data .",
    "we find the best - fit isothermal halo and nfw halo .",

    "the @xmath57 halo fits do not necessarily have parameters that are realistic or consistent with @xmath0cdm .",

    "this halo was required to match the velocities at the outer radii of each galaxy while constraining the concentration to agree with cosmology .",
    "we chose a value of @xmath56 which forced the nfw velocities to match as many of the data points in the turn - over region as closely as possible , with a minimum requirement of falling within the errorbars .",
    "this is a reasonable constraint because dark matter must explain the high velocities at large radii where the contribution of the baryons has fallen off .",
    "equation 7 of @xcite , which gives the concentration as a function of @xmath56 @xcite , was then used to calculate the concentration .",
    "we adjusted this concentration to agree with the cosmology of @xcite by subtracting 0.011 dex @xcite .",
    "we did not include the last four  points of f563 - 1 nor the last three  points of f583 - 4 in the halo fits .",
    "the f563 - 1 points were excluded because they are based on few fibers and because of the significant inconsistency with the long - slit and hi  rotation curves as discussed in @xmath6 4.1 .",
    "the outer  points of f583 - 4 spike to higher velocities than the long - slit data at the equivalent radii .",
    "neither the isothermal nor nfw halo model will be able to fit this feature in the  rotation curve .",
    "these  points also have little influence on the halo fits ; there is essentially no change in the values of the isothermal or nfw halo parameters , only much improved @xmath59 , when the three points are removed .",
    "there are 2 and 3 hi  points beyond the optical data for ugc 4325 and f583 - 4 , respectively , which were also not used . though the rise then sudden decline suggested by the combined optical and hi  data for ugc 4325 may well be real ,",
    "no simple , smooth model can fit it .",
    "since we are interested in the inner halo structure as probed by the new data , we exclude the 2 hi points . for a thorough comparison of many more independent data for this galaxy see @xcite",
    "the situation is similar for the hi  points of f583 - 4 .",

    "<S> we present high resolution two - dimensional velocity fields from integral field spectroscopy along with derived rotation curves for eleven low surface brightness galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we fit nfw and pseudo - isothermal halo models to the new data combined with previous long - slit and hi  data . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> we find the pseudo - isothermal halo to better represent the data than the nfw halo , as the nfw concentrations are often lower than expected for a @xmath0cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results to previous studies and find that including the new two - dimensional optical data does not significantly alter the halo parameters , but does decrease the uncertainties by roughly a factor of 2 . </S>"
