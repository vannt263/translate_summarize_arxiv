    "the final fate of gravitational collapse is one of the most important unsolved problems in gravitation physics . in general relativity ,",
    "singularity theorems were proved stating that spacetime singularities inevitably appear under general situations and physical energy conditions  @xcite . in this context , a _ cosmic censorship hypothesis _ ( cch ) was proposed by penrose , which asserts that singularities formed in generic gravitational collapse of physical matter can not be observed ; in other words , there are no _ naked singularities _ formed in physical gravitational collapse  @xcite .",
    "there are two versions of this hypothesis .",
    "the weak cch asserts that all singularities formed in gravitational collapse are hidden inside black holes and can not be observed from infinity , which implies the future predictability of the spacetime outside the black - hole event horizons . on the other hand , the strong cch asserts that no singularities are observable .    at the present time , however , the general proof of cch is far from complete ; on the contrary , many counterexample candidates have been proposed in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the generic occurrence of naked singularities has been shown in the spherical dust collapse represented by the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution  @xcite and in the null dust collapse represented by the vaidya solution  @xcite although the absence of pressure is not physically reasonable . for a perfect fluid with a reasonable equation of state @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pressure and the energy density , respectively , the generic occurrence of naked singularities in spherical",
    "collapse has been shown by numerical simulations for @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "of course , the assumption of spherical symmetry is very strong . in a genuine counterexample of cch ,",
    "the solution must be stable against non - spherical perturbations .",

    "it has been shown numerically that the naked singularity formation in the ltb solution is marginally stable against odd - parity perturbations but is unstable against even - parity perturbations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the naked singularity formation in the self - similar vaidya solution has been shown to be stable against even - parity perturbations  @xcite . in the perfect - fluid case , stability of the naked singularity formation against non - spherical perturbations is still open .",
    "singularity theorems imply that a stage with infinitely high curvature can be realized in the very final stage of gravitational collapse .",
    "the effects of quantum gravity will be unavoidable there . until now , many quantum theories of gravity have been proposed . among them , superstring theory is the most promising candidate , which predicts a higher - dimensional spacetime . if superstring theory is the correct quantum theory of gravity , the effects of the extra dimensions will become significant near singularity formation .",
    "when the curvature radius around a center is comparable to the compactification radius of the extra dimensions , the collapse must be effectively higher - dimensional .",
    "however , the non - perturbative aspects of superstring theory are so far not understood completely although the progress in recent years has been remarkable .",
    "given the present circumstances , taking string effects perturbatively into classical gravity is one possible approach to study the quantum effects of gravity .",

    "then , at any point on such a geodesic , @xmath187 with equality holding only for radial null geodesics .",
    "for the future - directed outgoing geodesics , this gives @xmath188 and @xmath189 in the untrapped and trapped regions , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath190 and @xmath191 are satisfied in the untrapped and trapped regions , respectively , where the subscripts represent causal ( excluding radial null ) geodesics and outgoing radial null geodesics , respectively .",
    "let us consider the @xmath41-plane .",
    "the singularity is located at @xmath74 for @xmath192 .",
    "first we consider the singularity with @xmath78 . by eq .",
    "( [ geodesics2 ] ) , the past - directed ingoing geodesics emanating from an event with @xmath82 in the trapped region can not reach the singularity at @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , there is no future - directed outgoing geodesic emanating from the singularity in the trapped region , i.e. , the singularity with @xmath78 is censored .",
    "next we focus on the singularity with @xmath193 , where @xmath194 holds .",
    "now suppose that @xmath195 extends back to a central singularity located at @xmath196 , where @xmath197 satisfies @xmath198 .",
    "there exists a portion of @xmath195 which is in the untrapped region .",
    "let @xmath7 be any point on such a potion of @xmath195 and to the future of the singularity .",
    "applying inequality ( [ geodesics1 ] ) at @xmath7 , we see that @xmath199 through @xmath7 crosses @xmath195 from above and hence the points on @xmath199 prior to @xmath7 must lie to the future of points on @xmath195 prior to @xmath7 , in the sense @xmath200 for @xmath201 , where @xmath202 corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the radial null geodesics must extend back to @xmath74 with @xmath98 satisfying @xmath203 , and so must emerge from the singularity .",
    "it is noted that @xmath204 holds in the case of @xmath5 .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the higher - dimensional misner - sharp mass is not an appropriate quasi - local mass in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "firstly , we give a definition of the higher - dimensional misner - sharp mass .",
    "we consider the @xmath1-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath205 with the general metric @xmath206 where @xmath207 is an arbitrary lorentz metric on @xmath208 , @xmath47 is a scalar function on @xmath208 with @xmath74 defining the boundary of @xmath208 , and @xmath209 is the unit curvature metric on @xmath210 .",
    "the higher - dimensional misner - sharp mass @xmath211 is a scalar on @xmath208 defined by @xmath212    there are several properties which a well - defined quasi - local mass should satisfy  @xcite .",
    "one of them states that there is an invariant mass function in spherically symmetric spacetime , that any definition of the quasi - local mass should be reduced to in the special case with spherical symmetry .",
    "in particular , in the schwarzschild spacetime of mass @xmath213 , the invariant mass function should coincide with @xmath213 because it is the unique vacuum solution in general relativity . in gauss - bonnet gravity ,",
    "on the other hand , the unique spherically symmetric vacuum solution is the gb - schwarzschild solution .",
    "therefore , a well - defined quasi - local mass in gauss - bonnet gravity should be reduced to the mass for this solution in the spherically symmetric vacuum case .",
    "the metric of the gb - schwarzschild solution is given by @xmath214 with @xmath215 where @xmath68 is a constant .",
    "the @xmath1-dimensional schwarzschild solution is obtained in the limit of @xmath216 as @xmath217 of which mass is given by @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the volume of an @xmath36-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "on the other hand , the mass for the gb - schwarzschild solution also coincides with @xmath213  @xcite .",
    "thus , a well - defined quasi - local mass should be reduced to @xmath213 for the spherically symmetric vacuum case in gauss - bonnet gravity as well as in general relativity .    from eq .",
    "( [ qlm ] ) , we can show @xmath220 for the @xmath1-dimensional schwarzschild solution , while we obtain @xmath221 for the gb - schwarzschild solution .",
    "indeed , @xmath211 does not coincide with @xmath213 for @xmath3 for the latter case .",
    "consequently , @xmath211 is not an appropriate quasi - local mass in gauss - bonnet gravity .    in this paper , @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ f - gb ] ) is adopted in order to evaluate the mass of the singularity .",
    "@xmath58 is preferable rather than @xmath211 in gauss - bonnet gravity because it is reduced to @xmath222 $ ] for the static limit , i.e. , in the gb - schwarzschild solution .",
