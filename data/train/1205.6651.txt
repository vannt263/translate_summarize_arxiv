    "grb 970828 is one of the first grbs with an observed afterglow @xcite and a determined redshift of @xmath8=0.9578 from the identification of its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this source is still presenting today , after 15 years from its observations , an extremely rich problematic in the identification of its astrophysical nature .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was discovered by the asca satellite 1.17 days after the grb trigger @xcite and the data showed the presence of a feature around @xmath9 5 kev , maybe associated to a radiative recombination edge of a h- or he - like ionized iron @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting was also a variable and large intrinsic absorption column which was found from the asca : the absence of an optical afterglow @xcite , the large intrinsic absorption column detected in the x - ray data @xcite and the contemporary detection in radio - wavelengths of the grb afterglow , imply a very large value for the circum - burst medium ( cbm ) , this variable absorption might be an indication of a strong inhomogeneous cbm distribution .",
    "@xcite described the presence of an evolving thermal component in the first 40 s of the emission of grb 970828 , as observed by the batse detector on board the compton gamma ray telescope @xcite .",
    "this thermal emission was associated to the photospheric grb emission of a relativistic expanding fireball @xcite , and from the observed properties of the blackbody spectrum it was inferred the bulk lorentz gamma factor of the expanding plasma , @xmath10 .",
    "this first thermal component is followed by a second emission episode , which starts @xmath9 50 s after the grb trigger .",
    "this second episode was neglected in the analysis of @xcite , where they explicitly stated to `` neglect here late - time episodes of engine activity that occur after @xmath9 25 and @xmath9 60 s in this burst '' .",
    "we have recently proposed that some grbs , namely grb 090618 @xcite and grb 101023 @xcite , can be described by two sharply different emission episodes . a first episode that is characterized by a thermal component in the early phases of its emission , which originates from an expanding source , not related to the grb emission .",
    "we have shown that this component is characterized by an expansion of the blackbody emitter , whose origin is associated to the latest phase of the life of a massive star . in the late phase of its evolution ,",
    "this massive star is well - described by a bare core that has lost its hydrogen envelope and most or entirely the helium one , during the previous stages of its evolution .",
    "this core is then observed to expand at non - relativistic velocities . at the end of the first episode ,",
    "the collapse to a black hole occurs and the actual grb emission happens . since this first episode occurs prior to the grb emission and to the formation of a black hole , we have referred to this as the proto - black - hole ( pbh - @xmath11 from the ancient greek that means anteriority in space and in time ) .    in this work",
    "we describe first the pbh component that we find in the first episode of grb 970828 light curve .",
    "we then proceed to the description of the second episode , which in this work represents the authentic grb emission .",
    "the grb emission is well explained in the context of the fireshell scenario , see e.g. @xcite for a complete review of the model .",
    "we find for the grb an @xmath12-plasma total energy of @xmath1 erg , a baryon load @xmath2 and a lorentz gamma factor at transparency of @xmath3 . from the numerical simulations we confirm the presence in the cbm of large average particle density , of the order of @xmath4 part/@xmath5 , and dense clouds with @xmath7 .",
    "we show that this can explain the `` dark '' nature of this grb and the observed large and variable column absorption in the asca x - ray afterglow .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with the analysis presented in @xcite and represents a further confirmation of the presence of a pbh in the early emission of grb 970828 .",
    "grb 970828 was discovered with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on 1997 august 28th @xcite . within 3.6 hr",
    "the rxte / pca scanned the region of the sky around the error box of the asm burst and detected a weak x - ray source @xcite .",
    "grb 970828 was also observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) and the grb experiment on ulysses @xcite .",
    "the batse - lad light curve is characterized by two main emission phenomena , see fig.[fig:4b.0 ] : the first lasts about 40 s and is well described by two main pulses , the second one is more irregular , being composed by several sharp pulses , lasting other 40 s. the x - ray afterglow observations started at about 0.1 days after the trigger time and continued up to 7 - 10 days .",
    "it is well described by a double power - law behavior , but a possible resurgence of soft x - ray emission , together with marginal evidence for the existence of fe lines , was reported by beppo - sax and asca @xcite .    the optical observations , which started about 4 hr after the burst , did not report any possible optical afterglow for grb 970828 up to @xmath13=23.8 @xcite . however , the observations at radio wavelengths of the burst position , 3.5 hrs after the initial burst , succeeded in identifying a source at a good significance level of 4.5 @xmath14 @xcite inside the rosat error circle ( 10  ) .",
    "the following deep searches for a possible optical counterpart of this radio source led to the identification of an interacting system of faint galaxies , successively recognized as the host galaxy of grb 970828 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of the brightest of this system of galaxies led to the identification of their redshift , being @xmath8=0.9578 .",
    "the lack of an optical transient associated with the afterglow of grb 970828 can be explained as due to the presence of strong absorption , due to dusty clouds in the burst site environment , whose presence does not affect the x - ray and the radio observations of the grb afterglow .    to analyze in detail this grb ,",
    "we have considered the observations of the batse - lad detector , which observed grb 970828 in the 25 - 1900 kev energy range , and then we have reduced the data by using the rmfit software package . for the spectral analysis we have considered the high energy resolution burst ( herb ) data , which consist of 128 separate high energy resolution spectra stored during the burst emission .",
    "the light curve was obtained by using the medium energy resolution ( mer ) data , which consist of 4.096 16-channel spectra summed from triggered detectors .",

    "this value of the p - grb energy is only 9 @xmath18 10@xmath19 the isotropic energy of the second episode , which we can assume as equal to the energy @xmath20 of the @xmath12-plasma of the grb emission . in this way , with the knowledge of the temperature at transparency and of the p - grb energy , we can derive the value of the baryon load from the numerical solutions of the fireshell equations of motion .",
    "these solutions for four different values of the total e@xmath21e@xmath22-plasma energy are shown in the fig .",
    "4 of @xcite .",
    "we find that the baryon load is @xmath2 , which corresponds to a lorentz gamma factor at transparency @xmath3 .",
    "the grb emission was simulated with very good approximation by using a density mask characterized by an irregular behavior : all the spikes correspond to spherical clouds with a large particle density @xmath23 part/@xmath5 , and with radius of the order of @xmath6 cm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.5 ] . considering all the clouds found in our analysis ,",
    "the average density of the cbm medium is @xmath24 particles/@xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding masses of the blobs are of the order of @xmath25 g , in agreement with the clumps found in grb 090618 .",
    "the results of the fireshell simulation are shown in table [ tab:4b.3 ] while the simulated light curve and spectrum are shown in fig .",

    "the possible presence of a supernova emission , observed ten days after the burst in grb 090618 @xcite but not spectroscopically confirmed , is at the same time very intriguing in light of the still unknown grb - sn connection @xcite .",
    "we have transposed the data of the `` bump '' rc - band light curve observed in the optical afterglow of grb 090618 , associated to the presence of a possible underlying supernova @xcite , to the redshift of grb 970828 .",
    "this simple operation concerns only the transformation of the flux observed , under the assumption that the sn has the same intrinsic luminosity : the variation of the magnitude only depends on the square of the difference between the luminosity distances .",
    "moreover , we have also transposed the @xmath27 and @xmath26band light curves of sn 1998bw @xcite , which is the prototype of a supernova associated to a grb . from the @xmath28 correction transformation formula ,",
    "the @xmath29band light curve , transposed at @xmath8=0.9578 , corresponds approximately to the observed @xmath26band light curve , so in principle we should consider the @xmath30 nm transposed light curve as the actual one observed with the @xmath31 nm optical filter .",
    "these transposed light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.6 ] .",
    "we conclude that the possible supernova emission could have been seen between 20 and 40 days after the grb trigger , neglecting any possible intrinsic extinction .",
    "the optical observations were made up to 7 days from the grb trigger , reaching a limit of @xmath32 @xcite and subsequent deeper images after @xmath33 days @xcite , so there are no observations in this time interval",
    ". however , the @xmath13-band extinction value should be large since the observed column density from the x - ray observations of the grb afterglow is large as well @xcite : the computed light curve for the possible sn of grb 970828 should be lowered by more than 1 magnitude , leading to a sn bump below the @xmath13 = 25.2 limit , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.6 ] .",
    "the presence of very dense clouds of matter near the burst site might be the cause of these absorptions .",
    "indeed we find the presence of clouds in our simulation at the average distances of @xmath34 cm from the grb progenitor , with average density of @xmath4 part/@xmath5 and typical dimensions of @xmath6 cm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.5 ] .    the possibility to observe the energy distribution from a grb in a very wide energy range",
    ", thanks to the newly space missions dedicated , has allowed to definitely confirm the presence of two separate emission episodes in grbs associated to sne .",
    "future missions , as the proposed loft , will allow to observe the thermal decay from these objects down to @xmath35 kev .",
    "the large area detector , designed for the loft mission , could be also able to observe in timing mode the emission from the newly born neutron star ( ns ) from supernovae ib / c , catching a possible characteristic signature of the neo - ns @xcite , shedding more light on the sn - grb enigma .",
    "a general conclusion is therefore appropriate : it is mandatory to proceed to a detailed spectral analysis in parallel to an identification of the physical and astrophysical nature of the source .",
    "this has been made explicitly clear in the analysis of grb 090618 @xcite .",
    "the crucial role of grb 090618 has been to evidence the existence of a new family of grbs , associated to sne , composed of two distinct emission episodes .",
    "this has been made possible thanks to different reasons : 1 ) the large number of detectors , fermi , swift bat and xrt , agile , suzaku - wam , konus - wind and coronas photon rt-2 , that allowed to study that grb in a very wide electromagnetic energy range , from 0.3 kev to 40 mev ; 2 ) the very large intensity emitted from grb 090618 , @xmath36 erg ; 3 ) the low redshift of the grb , @xmath8 = 0.54 .",
    "although both episodes radiate in the hard x - ray energy range , the first episode originates from a non - relativistic expansion process , having an expansion velocity of @xmath9 1000 km / s , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.2 ] , and occurring prior to the formation of a black hole ; the second one is the one occurring at the formation of the black hole and is the authentic grb emission .",
    "of course , the understanding of these two components can not be done only on a phenomenological basis , but it requires an understanding of the underlying physical and astrophysical processes .",
    "we verify in this work that indeed grb 970828 is a member of this family .",
    "the new understanding leads to a wealth of information on the evolution of the thermal component and of the radius of the blackbody emitter , given by eq .",

    "finally , from the analogy with the optical bump observed in grb 090618 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4b.6 ] , associated to a possible sn emission @xcite , we have given reasons why a possible sn associated to grb 970828 would not have been observable due to the large interstellar local absorption , in agreement with the large column density observed in the asca x - ray data @xcite and with the large value we have inferred for the cbm density distribution , @xmath42 particles/@xmath5 .",
