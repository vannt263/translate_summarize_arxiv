    "the school has no leaders and each fish follows the same behavioral rules .",
    "2 .   to decide where to move , each fish uses some form of weighted average of the position and orientation of its nearest neighbors .",
    "3 .   there is a degree of uncertainty in the individual s behavior that reflects both the imperfect information - gathering ability of a fish and the imperfect execution of the fish s actions .",
    "we remark that similar assumptions , but deterministic ones , were also introduced by reynolds @xcite .",
    "as seen in section 2 , we formulate the motion of each individual by a system of deterministic and stochastic differential equations .",
    "the weight of average is taken analogously to the law of gravitation .",
