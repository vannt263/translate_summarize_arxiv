    "collections of interacting self - motile objects fall into the class of systems known as active matter @xcite , which can be biological in nature such as swimming bacteria @xcite or animal herds @xcite , a social system such as pedestrian or traffic flow @xcite , or a robotic swarm @xcite .",
    "there are also a wide range of artificial active matter systems such as self - propelled colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "studies of these systems have generally focused on the case where the motile objects interact with either a smooth or a static substrate ; however , the field is now advancing to a point where it is possible to ask how such systems behave in more complex static or dynamic environments .",
    "one subclass of active systems is a collection of interacting disks that undergo either run - and - tumble @xcite or driven diffusive @xcite motion .",
    "such systems have been shown to exhibit a transition from a uniform density liquid state to a motility - induced phase separated state in which the disks form dense clusters surrounded by a low density gas phase @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that when phase - separated run - and - tumble disks are coupled to a random pinning substrate , a transition to a uniform density liquid state occurs as a function of the maximum force exerted by the substrate @xcite .",
    "in other studies of run - and - tumble disks driven over an obstacle array by a dc driving force , the onset of clustering coincides with a drop in the net disk transport since a large cluster acts like a rigid object that can only move through the obstacle array with difficulty ; in addition , it was shown that the disk transport was maximized at an optimal activity level or disk running time @xcite .",
    "studies of flocking or swarming disks that obey modified vicsek models of self - propulsion @xcite interacting with obstacle arrays indicate that there is an optimal intrinsic noise level at which collective swarming occurs @xcite , and that transitions between swarming and non - swarming states can occur as a function of increasing substrate disorder @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in such swarming models differ from those of the active disk systems , so it is not clear whether the same behaviors will occur across the two different systems .",
    "a number of studies have already considered active matter such as bacteria or run - and - tumble disks interacting with periodic obstacle arrays @xcite or asymmetric arrays @xcite .",
    "self - ratcheting behavior occurs for the asymmetric arrays when the combination of broken detailed balance and the substrate asymmetry produces directed or ratcheting motion of the active matter particles @xcite , and it is even possible to couple passive particles to the active matter particles in such arrays in order to shuttle cargo across the sample @xcite . in the studies described above , the substrate is static , and external driving is introduced via fluid flow or chemotactic effects ; however , it is also possible for the substrate itself to be dynamic , such as in the case of time dependent optical traps @xcite or a traveling wave substrate .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of colloids in traveling wave potentials reveal a rich variety of dynamical phases , self - assembly behaviors , and directed transport @xcite .    here",
    "we examine a two - dimensional system of run and tumble active matter disks that can exhibit motility induced phase separation interacting with a periodic quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) traveling wave substrate . in the low activity limit , the substrate - free system forms a uniform liquid state , while in the presence of a substrate , the disks are readily trapped by the substrate minima and swept through the system by the traveling wave . as the activity increases , a partial decoupling transition of the disks and the substrate occurs , producing a drop in the net effective transport .",
    "this transition is correlated with the onset of the phase separated state , in which the clusters act as large scale composite objects that can not be transported as easily as individual disks by the traveling wave .",
    "we also find that the net disk transport is optimized at particular traveling wave speeds , disk run length , and substrate strength . in the phase separated state we observe an interesting effect where the center of mass of each cluster moves in the direction opposite to that in which the traveling wave is moving , and we also find reversals to states in which the clusters and the traveling wave move in the same direction . the reversed motion of the clusters arises due to asymmetric growth and shrinking rates on different sides of the cluster .",
