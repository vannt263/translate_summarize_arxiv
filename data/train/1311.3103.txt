    "the single point lens equation can be analytically solved @xcite .",
    "the lens equation for a double lens becomes considerably more complex , and is no longer analytical @xcite . in this case , when the source is far away from the caustics , there are always three images ; when the source is inside the caustics , the number of images increases by two .",
    "it is analytically known that for five image configurations , the minimum total magnification is 3 @xcite .",
    "the light curve of a double lens can be diverse , depending on the lens parameters and source trajectory . for extreme mass ratios , there is a well - known degeneracy between close and wide separation binaries which yields essentially identical light curves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , planetary and stellar double lens light curves can also mimic each other @xcite .",
    "many of these degeneracies can be ( partially ) broken with accurate photometry and cadence , or with additional information from parallax ( e.g. , @xcite ) or finite source size effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless an analytical understanding of the degeneracy in the lens equation is helpful in searching the parameter space .",
    "historically , a wrong solution has been picked in the presence of degeneracy for the parallax microlensing event macho - lmc-5 , which was later corrected with analytical insight @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for some geometries , the magnification pattern and resulting light curves from multiple planets are qualitatively degenerate with those from single - planet lensing without providing mathematical explanations .",
    "@xcite examined the caustics of multiple lenses in two extreme cases , i.e. , the separations between each two lenses are either very large with respect to their einstein radii , or very small compared to the enstein radius of the total mass .",
    "he also demonstrated a principle of duality between planets external and internal to the einstein ring , which turned out to be the close - wide degeneracy for multiple stars .",
    "the recent discovery of two double - planet systems @xcite illustrates a need for exploring further the degeneracy for multiple ( @xmath0 ) lenses or new degeneracies yet to be found . due to the greater number of parameters in triple lensing ,",
    "the search of the parameter space is even more time - consuming , and so analytical guidance becomes even more important .",
    "this paper is an attempt to explore this issue .",
    "compared to the previous studies , we explore a few new issues : ( 1 ) we , for the first time , discuss the three - body vs. three - body (  [ sec : triple ] ) and two - body vs. three - body (  [ sec : double ] ) degeneracies in great detail ( which was mentioned in @xcite ) . in particular , we give detailed procedures in  [ sec : degeneracy ] and appendix a how to explore this degeneracy .",
    "( 2 ) we explore the correlation between different parameters ( error ellipses ) for the first time ( figs . 4 and 5 ) through concrete examples of light curves . ( 3 ) we also pay more attention to light curves and consider the residual between the degenerate cases to show the strength of the degeneracies .",
    "( 4 ) technically , the methods we use are somewhat different : we use complex notations and expand the lens equations directly used by dominik ( 1999 ) and an ( 2005 ) whose papers are mainly about binary lenses . in contrast , @xcite mostly used polar coordinates and expand the jacobian determinant to investigate the caustics of multiple lenses .",
    "the structure of the remaining paper is as follows . in  [ sec : lenssystem ] we present the lens equation and our notations ; in  [ sec : degeneracy ] and  [ sec : other ] we generalise the degeneracies found in triple lenses ; finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] we briefly discuss our results .",
    "we start this section by presenting the @xmath1-point lens equation , and then introduce the notations we use for later discussions .      in complex notation",
    ", the @xmath1-point lens equation can be written as ( @xcite ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the source and its lensed image positions , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the position and the mass of the @xmath7-th lens .",
    "note that , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent complex conjugates of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the lens equation describes the mapping from the lens plane onto the source plane .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the mapping is given by @xmath10 the determinant of the jacobian matrix is @xmath11 . since gravitational lensing conserves surface brightness",
    ", the magnification is simply given by @xmath12 . obviously , if @xmath13 , the magnification @xmath14 is formally infinite .",
    "image positions satisfying this condition form one or more closed `` critical curve(s ) '' in the lens plane , which are mapped into `` caustics '' in the source plane . for convenience , we plot all these curves on the same plane in units of the angular einstein radius ( see equation  [ re ] in  [ sec : notations ] ) .       in two",
    "coordinate systems .",
    "the three lenses are labelled as @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "both coordinate systems are centred on the primary lens @xmath15 , and the two separations are labelled as @xmath18 and @xmath19 with a characteristic angle @xmath20 between them . in the first coordinate system ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are on the horizontal axis , and the source trajectory is parameterised by two parameters , i.e. , the impact parameter @xmath21 and the trajectory angle @xmath22 . in the second coordinate system",
    ", the @xmath23-axis in an arbitrary direction is chosen as the horizontal axis and the angle between the @xmath23-axis and the line connecting @xmath15 and @xmath16 is denoted as the direction angle @xmath24 . ]    in this paper , we do not consider blending and finite - source size effect .",
    "moreover , we also do not include microlens parallax and orbital motion effects .",
    "so the trajectory of the lens - source relative motion is a straight line , and all the lens systems are static .",
    "@xcite suggested a set of notational conventions for point lens microlensing ( see @xcite for further extensions to the double - lens case with orbital motion and even full keplerian solutions ) . in their notation the distances to the lens and source",
    "are denoted as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the distance between the lens and source are @xmath27 .",
    "the angular einstein radius is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the lens .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use angular coordinates which are normalised to @xmath30 defined above , and the corresponding time is normalised by the einstein radius crossing time @xmath31 .",
    "the total lens mass @xmath29 is normalised to unity ( @xmath32 ) .    for any lens system , there are three basic parameters @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the time of the closest approach to the lens system `` center '' , @xmath21 is the corresponding lens - source projected separation ( in units of @xmath30 ) at @xmath34 , and @xmath31 is the einstein radius crossing time .",
    "normally , we set the origin of the coordinate system at the position of the primary object .    in a static double - lens system , there are two mass components @xmath35 , where @xmath15 is the primary mass and @xmath16 is the secondary mass ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "three additional parameters are needed to describe the configuration of the double - lens , namely @xmath37 , or equally @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the mass ratio of the binaries , @xmath40 is the projected separation between the primary and secondary objects ( in units of @xmath30 ) , and @xmath41 is the direction of lens - source relative motion with respect to the double - lens axis ( primary toward secondary ) , i.e. , the angle from the double - lens axis to the trajectory counterclockwise .    similarly , a static triple - lens has six additional parameters ( compared to a single lens model ) @xmath42 or equally @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath41 is the angle from the @xmath18-axis to the trajectory counterclockwise , @xmath20 is the angle from the @xmath18-axis to the @xmath19-axis counterclockwise . for later convenience , we also define an angle @xmath24 from the @xmath23-axis of the chosen coordinate system to the @xmath18-axis ( measured counterclockwise ) . henceforth , we call @xmath22 the `` trajectory angle '' , @xmath20 the `` characteristic angle '' and @xmath24 the `` direction angle '' . fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] illustrates all the parameters in a static triple - lens system .",
    "specially , in the absence of parallax effects , a static triple - lens system has an obvious discrete degeneracy , @xmath47 it also indicates an axial symmetry which can reduce the range of @xmath20 from @xmath48 $ ] to @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "in this section , we first explore the close / wide degeneracy in triple lensing with two planets , and then a continuous degeneracy arising in the external shear approximation .",
    "these theories are mainly suitable to the central caustics , which are defined as the caustics in the vicinity of the primary object .              for planetary lensing ,",
    "i.e. , when the mass ratio @xmath50 , @xcite showed that the traditional perturbative method can be applied . afterwards ,",
    "@xcite re - examined that the central caustics can be expanded into a symmetric representation to the linear approximation : @xmath51 } , \\label{pcu1}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the phase angle , @xmath53 is the parametric form of the ( linear approximation of the ) central caustics and @xmath54 is the planetary position in complex notation . note that the shape of the central caustics remains the same when @xmath54 is changed into @xmath55 , which indicates the close / wide degeneracy .",
    "the formalism can be generalised to the @xmath1 planet ( plus primary ) case : @xmath56},\\ ] ] which indicates a @xmath57 planetary close / wide degeneracy in microlensing .",
    "this degeneracy has already been found in observation @xcite , and is consistent with the conclusion drawn by @xcite ( see his  5.1 ) , who used a different mathematical method . here",
    "a simulated example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4-fold ] .",

    "the red solid lines are drawn numerically , while the blue dashed lines are the linear approximation ( equation  [ pcu2 ] ) - they are quite similar but show subtle differences , which can be seen in the residual of the light curves .",
    "all the parameters used are shown in table  [ tab : para](1 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4-fold](ii ) , there are two deviating features in the residual between the close - close case ( c ) and the wide - wide case ( a ) . by comparing the wide - close case ( b ) and the wide - wide case ( a ) , we can conclude that the first feature ( @xmath58 @xmath59 to 0.005 ) is due to the second planet ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "similarly , the second feature ( @xmath58 0.005 to 0.060 ) is due to the first planet ( @xmath61 ) and more notable than the first one . as a result ,",
    "the perturbations caused by individual planets are separated in this example , and this phenomena is consistent with the prediction by @xcite .    since @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( in the wide - wide case )",
    ", it indicates that if a planet is closer to the einstein radius of the star , the difference in its close / wide degeneracy will be more significant , i.e. , the degeneracy is much easier to break .",
    "in addition , a heavier planet can also weaken the degeneracy .",
    "note that , @xmath64 are chosen strictly by the @xmath40-@xmath65 law .",
    "however , when fitting the real data , we can obtain even better degenerate solutions around these values by small changes , and thus the close / wide degeneracy may be stronger in practice .",
    "when all the other lenses are much farther away from the einstein radius of the primary lens , the external shear approximation @xcite is valid . here",
    ", we rewrite the lens equation  ( [ lenseq ] ) in triple - lens case ( @xmath66 ) , and taylor - expand the deflection terms caused by two of the masses ( @xmath16 & @xmath17 ) at the location of the primary mass ( @xmath15 ) @xmath67 \\left({\\bar{z}}- { \\bar{z}}_1\\right)^{k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to transform equation  ( [ taylor ] ) into a specific form which describes a point - mass lens under perturbation @xmath69 where @xmath70 m_1^{k \\over 2}. \\label{shear}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] if all @xmath71 are equal to each other for two lens systems , it will be a perfect degeneracy .",
    "however , this would also imply two systems are identical . instead of the perfect but trivial degeneracy",
    ", we can identify approximate degeneracies by truncating equation  ( [ perturb ] ) after @xmath72 ( see @xcite ) @xmath73 and such degeneracies may be indistinguishable within observational uncertainty . throughout this paper , we use primed symbols for the parameters of derived degenerate systems , to differentiate them from those of the initial system .",
    "note that in this case , three component equations in equations  ( [ gammaeq0 ] ) are responding to five lens parameters named @xmath74 , and one relative parameter is needed when comparing two different lens systems .",
    "so it is convenient to include another parameter to determine the relative orientation between each triple - lens system , and we find the direction angle @xmath24 is quite suitable . by choosing parameter set @xmath75 , we can always make the first two @xmath71 terms to be the same for two different lens systems , i.e. , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are two complex constants .",
    "now , there are four equations to determine six free parameters in a triple - lens system , implying a continuous degeneracy with two remaining parameters @xmath20 and @xmath24 . to simplify calculation",
    ", we also choose the position of the primary lens mass ( @xmath15 ) as the origin of the coordinate system . hence , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . as a result",
    ", the external shear equations for triple - lens can be derived from equations  ( [ shear ] ) and  ( [ gammaeq ] ) as    [ 3sheareq ] @xmath82    where @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "note that both the initial and derived triple - lens parameters satisfy these equations .    in principle",
    ", there are two steps to obtain all potential continuous degenerate solutions .",
    "firstly , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are calculated by equations  ( [ 3sheareq ] ) with the initial parameters @xmath85 .",
    "and then , equations  ( [ 3sheareq ] ) are called again to calculate all sets of derived parameters @xmath86 .",
    "we find that when @xmath87 are chosen , equations  ( [ 3sheareq ] ) can be solved analytically ( see appendix  [ subsec:3 - 3 ] for the detailed procedure ) .",
    "moreover , in the coordinate system determined by @xmath24 , the trajectory angle should be @xmath88 which is crucial when generating the degenerate light curves .                            to check the reliability of the truncation in equation  ( [ perturb ] ) , higher - order effects should be considered , i.e. , for @xmath89 , if we have @xmath90 then there should be a set of `` continuous degeneracies '' for different triple - lens systems .",
    "for the assumptions and approximation discussed in ",
    "[ sec : shear ] , equation  ( [ perturb ] ) is suitable to describe the shape of the central caustics .",
    "although they turn out to be much smaller than the ones near other lower mass objects ( i.e. , planetary caustics ) , these caustics play dominant roles in high magnification events , which are particularly important in the current mode of discovering exoplanets where a combination of surveys and followups is used ( ) .",
    "[ fig : triple ] shows three examples of the external shear continuous degeneracies in static triple - lens case .",
    "the red solid lines are for the initial system , while the blue dashed lines represent one of the continuous degenerate systems whose parameters are calculated by equation  ( [ 3sheareq ] ) .",
    "the left panel shows the comparison around the peak region , and the right panel shows the comparison of the central caustics .",
    "note that we have already shifted the blue dashed caustic as suggested by equation  ( [ shift ] ) to overlap those two caustics together , and set @xmath91 in the figures for convenience .",
    "all the parameters are shown in table  [ tab : para](2 ) .",
    "as shown in these examples , the external shear degeneracies exist in triple - lens case , although they may not always have the same strength .    in the simulated events , the magnifications are very high @xmath92 , still when the angles are not so different ( see the top panel ) , the differences are only @xmath93 mag lasting for @xmath94 ( approximately a few hours for a typical event ) , which may be difficult to detect even using the next generation microlensing event .",
    "for the other two panels , the differences are somewhat larger , reaching @xmath95 mag and @xmath96 mag respectively .",
    "we have simulated many more events , and find some trends between the degenerate strength and the input parameters @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the correlation between the degenerate strength and these parameters are as follows :    1 .   when @xmath100 , there are some @xmath20 values which may make the analytic method invalid .",
    "first of all , when @xmath101 or @xmath102 , equations  ( [ 3sheareq : b ] ) and ( [ 3sheareq : d ] ) are equal to 0 . to get a non - trivial solution , the only choice is to set @xmath103 , which means that the initial triple - lens system will be degenerate with a double - lens system .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : double ] . secondly , when @xmath104 , equation  ( [ 3sheareq : b ] ) is equal to 0 .",
    "we have either @xmath103 or @xmath105 , leading to a trivial solution .",
    "similarly , when @xmath106 or @xmath107 , equation  ( [ 3sheareq : d ] ) is equal to 0 . as a result , the degeneracy will vanish around @xmath106 , @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",
    "2 .   in fact , these discreet @xmath20 values divide the whole characteristic angular space into four regions , i.e. , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the degeneracy strength behaves differently in these regions . for @xmath113 ,",
    "a smaller @xmath20 makes the degeneracy stronger , which can be seen by comparing the first two examples in fig .  [ fig : triple ] .",
    "both having @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the degeneracy of the first example is stronger because a smaller @xmath20 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath117 , this correlation is weak and even reversed when @xmath20 approaches @xmath102 .",
    "finally , for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the degeneracy is normally weak although becomes stronger when @xmath20 is @xmath118 or @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , an acute @xmath20 has a stronger degeneracy than its complementary ( @xmath120 ) , i.e. , there is no symmetry about @xmath104 .",
    "for example , with @xmath121 in the first example ( fig .",
    "[ fig : triple]a  and  [ fig : triple]b ) , the residual between the light curves is quite small even though @xmath114 .",
    "but when @xmath122 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : triple]e  and  [ fig : triple]f ) , @xmath123 leads to far more significant deviations .",
    "4 .   not surprisingly , the degeneracy becomes stronger if @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "besides , there seems no symmetry about @xmath126 : for @xmath113 and @xmath117 , the degeneracies with @xmath127 are always better than those with @xmath128 ; while for @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the opposite is true . actually , all the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : triple ] are simulated with @xmath127 and @xmath115 .    to illustrate how",
    "different parameters may be correlated in a real event , we simulate a light curve covering a duration of @xmath131 with 8642 data points ( corresponding to a cadence of 10 min for a typical microlensing event with @xmath132 d ) .",

    "the @xmath133 contours have some interesting features . for @xmath140 ,",

    "we also give detailed recipes to calculate the parameters satisfying the external shear degeneracy ( see appendix  [ app2 ] ) . with these recipes",
    ", the whole parameter space can be searched through numerical method , e.g. , monte carlo markov chain method .",
    "the continuous degeneracy implies that the double and triple lenses may be degenerate .",
    "this has the important consequence that in some cases , multiple planet systems may be mistakenly identified as a single planet system .",
    "if this happens , a wrong set of planetary parameters may be derived and the frequency of multiple planet systems will be under - estimated .",
    "naively the probability for triple lensing may be somewhat lower due to binary lensing since it requires two planets to be present .",
    "however , if all the systems are in a single orbital plane , then the chance of detecting two planets may be boosted when viewed edge on .",
    "the probability of this degeneracy being observed will depend on the detailed predictions from the planet formation theories .",
    "indeed microlensing is perhaps the only way to probe multiple planet population at a few au .",
    "the next - generation microlensing experiment such as the korean microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet ) presents an exciting possibility to explore this parameter space .",
