    "it is not an exaggeration to say that @xmath0-bosons along with their charged partners , @xmath13-bosons , have been at the focus of attention in high - energy physics over more than the past two decades .",
    "the properties of these particles , which are mediators of weak interaction between leptons and quarks , were studied in detail in experiments at the lep and slc electron - positron colliders . in a series of experiments performed between 1989 and 1995 at cern @xcite ,",
    "enormous statistics of observations of @xmath0-boson production and decays were collected . in all , approximately @xmath14 events associated with leptonic modes of @xmath0-boson decay and more than @xmath15 events of transformation of these unstable particles into hadrons were detected .",
    "the results of these investigations made it possible to determine , among other things , the mass of the @xmath0-boson , @xmath16 , and its total decay width , @xmath17 , to an extremely high degree of precision @xcite .",
    "many other parameters of the process @xmath18 were also analyzed both in the vicinity of the @xmath19-resonance and far from it @xcite .",
    "the precision of experimental data reached in recent years has given a motivation to theoretical physicists for performing formidable work on calculating radiative corrections to the processes involving @xmath0-boson production and decay ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    not only does @xmath0-boson physics provide a precision test for standard model predictions concerning particle interactions , but it is also a unique tool for seeking manifestations of new physics ( beyond the standard model ) , which will replace sooner or later the generally accepted @xmath20 scheme . despite the impressive successes of the standard model in adequately describing a formidable set of experimental data , there is no doubt among the physics community that the modern model of fundamental interactions can not be conclusive because of a number of fundamental theoretical drawbacks .",
    "these include , first , an enormous number ( more than 19 ! ) of independent input parameters  coupling constants , the masses of quark and leptons , the parameters of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix , etc ; second , the instability of the mass of the as - yet - undiscovered higgs boson with respect to quadratically divergent radiative corrections and the allied hierarchy problem ; and , third , the isolated character of gravitational interactions , which do not fit in the existing quantum model .",
    "this is not the whole story , however .",
    "paradoxically as it is , the main drawback of the standard model at the present time is that it is in perfect agreement with all experimental data accumulated thus far , providing no hint as to the nature of new physics that will have to replace it .",
    "this kind of `` recess '' in the experimental development of physics theory caused a flash of creative activity in theoretical physics in attempts at guessing vague outlines of a new theory of everything . by no means",
    "do grand unification theories , supersymmetry , supergravity , superstrings , supermembranes , and @xmath21-theory exhaust the list of ideas that require an experimental verification .",
    "the questions that a future theory should answer include that of the origin of particle masses , that of why our space - time is four - dimensional , that of why several generations of leptons exist , that of how many flavors quarks have , and that of how many neutrino flavors exist .",
    "even today , physicists try to find answers to many of these questions by analyzing available experimental data .    for example , the total invisible width of @xmath0-bosons , @xmath22 , with respect to the decays of these particles through channels that are rather difficult to detect plays an important role in @xmath0-boson physics . in the experiments performed at the lep accelerator ,",
    "the invisible width @xmath23 was determined indirectly as the difference of the total decay width of the @xmath0-boson and its total width with respect to all observed decays . in the standard model , the invisible decay width of the @xmath0-boson",
    "is interpreted as the partial width with respect to decays to neutrinos of various flavors : @xmath24    this quantity can be considered as some kind of a counter of neutrino generations , and its precise measurement is of particular interest for new physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is intriguing that the present - day experimental value of the number of neutrinos from the invisible decay width of the @xmath0-boson , @xmath25 @xcite , differs somewhat from the result expected in the standard model , @xmath26 .",
    "exotic channels of @xmath0-boson decay frequently provide unique tests for some fundamental principles of modern physics .",
    "for example , analysis of the forbidden ( in a vacuum ) @xmath0-boson decays to photons ( @xmath27 ) and gluons ( @xmath28 ) makes it possible to establish a quantitative measure of the principle of quantum indistinguishability of integer - spin particles  bose symmetry for photons and gluons @xcite . according to the landau - yang theorem @xcite",
    ", a massive vector particle can not decay to massless vector states . in an external electromagnetic field , however , the reactions @xmath27 and @xmath28 become possible @xcite .    the problem of searches for new possible manifestations of supersymmetry is also tightly related to @xmath0-boson physics .",
    "there is still a hope for finding relatively light superparticles produced in rare channels of @xmath0-boson decay . as an example",
    ", one can consider the reaction @xmath29 , in which a pair of light gluinos , @xmath30 , having a mass of about @xmath31  gev appear .",
    "this process , which is extensively discussed in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) , is of special interest in view of prospects for observing new - physics manifestations at next - generation @xmath32-colliders .",
    "projects of experiments with @xmath0-bosons at the large hadron collider(lhc ) also caused interest in studying the properties of these particles in the presence of a quark - gluon plasma , which is quite an unusual environment of @xcite .",
    "in view of the aforesaid , it is of particular interest to discuss some other new phenomena in @xmath0-boson physics that manifest themselves under unusual conditions . in this study , we investigate changes in partial decay widths of the @xmath0-boson in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields .",
    "interest in such investigations is explained both by astrophysical applications and by applications in the physics of relativistic particles channeling through single crystals ( so - called channeling of particles @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the strength of electric fields generated by the axes and planes of single crystals may reach formidable values of ( @xmath33v / m ) @xcite over macroscopic distances . at the same time",
    ", it is well known that astrophysics studies exotic objects ( neutron stars , white dwarfs ) that , at the latest stages of their evolution , can undergo a strong compression , and this leads to a significant increase in the magnetic field strength inside them ( @xmath34 g @xcite ) . at such enormous values of the external field strength ,",
    "the physics of quantum processes changes significantly .",
    "external fields frequently remove the forbiddance of specific reactions whose occurrence is impossible in a vacuum .",
    "the first investigations into the physics of relativistic particles in the presence of a strong external field were performed within quantum electrodynamics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "later , the technique of calculations that was developed there was also used in non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "respective calculations rely on the method of exact solutions to the wave equations for charged particles , which makes it possible to take into account the interaction with the electromagnetic field beyond standard perturbation theory . in this case , the wave functions for all charged particles and their propagators are modified in quite a unwieldy manner , depending on the configuration of an external field @xcite .",
    "although the resulting expressions are cumbersome and although the calculations are quite involved , the ultimate results , which are valid at arbitrarily high values of the external - electromagnetic - field strength , carry information that can not be obtained by perturbative methods , and this is an obvious advantage of the method . from this point of view , investigation of quantum processes in superstrong fields provides a unique possibility of analyzing the self - consistency of the physical theory globally in the case where an expansion in a small parameter is impossible .",
    "the method of calculations that is used below is based on the crossed - field model , which was successfully applied in the previous studies of the present author to studying photino - pair production @xcite and to analyzing the decays of @xmath35-bosons in an external field @xcite .",
    "in the leading order of perturbation theory in the coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the matrix element of @xmath0-boson decay to a pair of charged leptons , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 the presence of an external electromagnetic field is taken into account via choosing specific wave functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the charged leptons @xmath38 .",
    "this approach , which , in particle physics , is referred to as the furry representation , yields , for the probability of @xmath0-boson decay , an expression in which electromagnetic interactions are taken into account exactly , beyond standard perturbation theory in the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "the explicit form of the wave functions for charged particles in an external electromagnetic field depends on the field configuration . in the present study",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the crossed - field configuration , in which case the strength tensor @xmath43 has the form @xmath44 it is assumed in this case that the external - electromagnetic - field potential @xmath45 is chosen in the gauge @xmath46 here , the unit constant @xmath47-vector @xmath48 determines the spatial field configuration and satisfies the conditions @xmath49 a crossed field is a particular case of the field of a plane electromagnetic wave having an isotropic wave @xmath47-vector @xmath50 .",
    "the invariant parameter @xmath51 characterizes the crossed - field strength and has the dimensions of energy .",
    "recall that , in an arbitrary reference frame , a crossed field is a superposition of constant electric and magnetic fields whose strength vectors are orthogonal and are equal in absolute value : @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , the two relativistic invariants of the electromagnetic field are zero : @xmath53 in the crossed - field model , the choice of wave @xmath47-vector @xmath54 is quite arbitrarily .",
    "it is only necessary that this vector be isotropic , have dimensions of energy , and satisfy the conditions @xmath55 in particular , the wave @xmath47-vector @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of the electromagnetic - field - strength tensor and the constant electromagnetic - potential @xmath47-vector @xmath57 as @xmath58 in dealing with the problem of @xmath0-boson decay , it is advisable to express the wave vector @xmath56 in terms of the @xmath0-boson 4-momentum @xmath59 and the electromagnetic - field - strength tensor @xmath60 ( see next section ) as @xmath61 in an arbitrary constant uniform electromagnetic field , the probability of the decay @xmath62 is a function of three invariant dimensionless parameters , @xmath63 .",
    "these parameters are determined by the strength tensor of an external macroscopic field as @xmath64 in the crossed - field model , the parameter @xmath6 has the simplest form @xmath65 the square of the wave vector ( [ wavevector ] ) having the form @xmath66 in a crossed field , the two parameters ( [ invarianta ] ) and ( [ invariantb ] ) of the external - field strength vanish by virtue of the equality in ( [ crossed ] ) , @xmath67 ; therefore , the right - hand side of eq.([k2 ] ) also vanishes . for a constant uniform electromagnetic field of general form",
    ", the condition that the wave vector in ( [ wavevector ] ) is isotropic is not satisfied : @xmath68 . even in this case , however , we can use the semiclassical crossed - field model , which ensures a satisfactory description of the decay probability in an electromagnetic field of general form , provided that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the closer to zero the right - hand side of eq.([k2 ] ) and the higher the precision to which the condition of isotropicity is satisfied , the more precise the results that are obtained in this approximation .",
    "the above constraints are obviously satisfied in the region of relatively weak electromagnetic fields for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the decay probability @xmath73 in a crossed field will correspond to the first leading term @xmath74 in the semiclassical expansion of the total decay probability @xmath75 in a power series in the vectors of the external - field strengths at small values of the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; that is , @xmath78 this relation between the probabilities of quantum processes in a crossed field and a constant electromagnetic field of general form was obtained for the first time within quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the wave functions for charged fermions in the field of a plane electromagnetic wave were obtained as far back as 1937 by d.m.volkov ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the case of a crossed field , these exact solutions to the dirac equations for leptons @xmath38 in an external field have the form @xmath79\\times \\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\biggl\\{1-\\frac{e(kx)}{4(pk)}(f_{\\mu\\lambda}\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\lambda ) \\biggr\\ } \\frac{u(p ) } { \\sqrt{2p_0 v}};\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath80\\times \\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\biggl\\{1+\\frac{e(kx)}{4(p'k)}(f_{\\mu\\lambda}\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\lambda ) \\biggr\\ } \\frac{u^c(p ' ) } { \\sqrt{2p'_0 v}};\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the spin part of these wave functions normalized to a three - dimensional spatial volume @xmath81 is determined by the constant dirac bispinors @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "it is also intriguing that , in the region around @xmath276 , the presence or the absence of the initial - gauge - boson electric charge is immaterial because the change in the decay width is due primarily to the increase in the phase space of final particles .    in the region of superstrong fields ( @xmath277 ) ,",
    "a sizable contribution to the total decay width of the @xmath0-boson comes from the @xmath11-quark - production process @xmath254 , which is forbidden in a vacuum by conservation laws . as the external - field strength increases , this reaction becomes dominant in relation to other modes of @xmath0-boson decay , this being due to a very large mass of the @xmath11-quark .",
    "the external field serves as some kind of a catalyst for super heavy - particle - production processes , which can not occur under ordinary conditions . in view of the aforesaid , it would be of interest to discuss searches for new ( as - yet - undiscovered ) hypothetical particles ( supersymmetry and so on ) among new @xmath0-boson decay modes that arise in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "although external - field strengths necessary for directly observing such reactions are not yet available in experiments ( see , for example , @xcite ) , these investigations are of course very interesting from the point of view of fundamental principles of physical theory .",
