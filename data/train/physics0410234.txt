    "the interaction of intense laser pulses with overdense plasmas has attracted much interest for the fast ignitor concept in inertial fusion energy @xcite .",
    "the interaction of ultrashort intense laser pulses with thin solid targets have also been of great interest for the application to high energy ion sources @xcite .",
    "ultraintense irradiation experiments using an infrared subpicosecond laser , e.g. , nd : glass ( @xmath3 1,053 nm ) or ti : sapphire ( @xmath3800 nm ) lasers , whose powers and focused intensities exceed 100 tw and @xmath4 w/@xmath5 , are possible using chirped pulse amplification techniques @xcite . in these experiments , the classical normalized momentum of electrons @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electron mass , @xmath8 is the speed of light , @xmath0 is the laser intensity in w/@xmath5 , and @xmath9 is the wavelength in @xmath10 m . on the other hand ,",
    "a krf laser ( @xmath3 248 nm ) has an advantage as the fast ignitor in that the critical density is close to the core , and hot electron energies are suitable since the critical density of the krf laser is ten times greater than that of an infrared laser @xcite .",
    "the peak intensities of krf laser systems were only the order of @xmath11 w/@xmath5 , namely @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the laser plasma interactions on the laser wavelength was not investigated in @xmath13 .",
    "recently , the laser absorption and hot electron generation have been studied by the high intensity krf laser system of which focused intensity is greater than @xmath14 w/@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the production of hot electrons by the high intensity krf laser has not been fully understood yet .",
    "namely , it has been not clear that the effects of laser wavelength on hot electrons produced by ultrashort intense laser pulse on solid - density targets .",
    "the absorption , electron energy spectrum , and hot electron temperature have usually been investigated and scaled using the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the electron density , critical density , and density scale length , respectively .",
    "critical density absorption of the laser light converts laser energy into hot electrons having a suprathermal temperature @xmath20 approximately proportional to @xmath21 for @xmath22 , and @xmath23mc^2 $ ] at moderate densities @xcite , where @xmath24 kev , @xmath7 is an electron rest mass .",
    "the scaling of the hot electron temperature has been supported by experiments of nd : glass and ti : sapphire lasers @xcite . on the other hand , the results of one - dimensional simulation for normal incidence in the density region @xmath25 and the normalized intensity @xmath26 have shown that @xmath27 mc^2 $ ] , where @xmath28 is the electromagnetic fields at the surface of the overdense plasma , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which depend weakly on @xmath1 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is weakly depend on the angle of incidence , absorption rate , and @xmath32@xcite .",
    "the hot electron temperature is scaled by the amplitude of electromagnetic fields at the plasma surface rather than that in vacuum ; namely , the hot electron temperature is slightly dependent on the wavelength .",
    "in addition , at the interaction of intense laser pulses with solid density plasma which has a sharp density gradient the hot electron temperature is scaled by @xmath33 rather than @xmath1 @xcite . in the present paper , we study the absorption of ultrashort intense laser pulses on overdense plasmas for different laser wavelengths ( @xmath2 = 0.25 , 0.5 , and 1 @xmath10 m ) using a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation .",
    "in order to investigate hot electron generation for oblique incidence , we use the relativistic 1 and @xmath34 dimensional pic simulation with the boost frame moving with @xmath35 parallel to the target surface , where @xmath8 and @xmath36 are the speed of light and an angle of incidence@xcite . in the simulation ,",
    "the target is the fully ionized plastic and the electron density @xmath37 .",
    "the density correspond to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath3 0.25 , 0.5 , and @xmath41 m , respectively .",
    "the density profile has a sharp density gradient , @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 . in order to clarify the boundary effect ,",
    "ions are fixed , namely , the boundary does not move all the time .",
    "the laser pulse starts at @xmath46 and propagates towards @xmath47 .",
    "the laser intensity rises in 5 fs and remains constant after that .",
    "the irradiated intensity @xmath48 w/@xmath5 and the angle of incidence @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( p - polarized ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath51 2.3 , 9.2 , and 36 for @xmath3 0.25 , 0.5 , and 1.0 @xmath10 m , respectively .",
    "however , @xmath52 for all wavelength .",
    "normalized electron energy distributions after 50 fs are shown in fig.1(a ) and 1(b ) for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the hot electron temperatures are 140 and 340 kev for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the hot electron temperatures does not depend on the laser wavelength .",
    "the result is well agreement with that of a simple sharp boundary theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorption depends on the laser wavelength , @xmath53 0.9 - 1.8% , 2.2 - 3.0% , and 3.6 - 4.3% and @xmath54 2.6 - 4.1% , 5.3 - 6.7% , and 7.8 - 9.0% for @xmath3 1.0 , 0.5 , and 0.25 @xmath10 m , respectively .",
    "the effects of laser wavelength on hot electrons produced by ultrashort intense laser pulse on solid - density targets are studied by the use of a pic simulation . as a result ,",
    "the dependence to the wavelength of hot electron temperature strongly depend on the boundary condition , even in the one dimensional case , namely , all are not determined only by @xmath1",
    ". the density profiles of both preformed plasma @xcite and multi - dimensional effects such as surface deformation @xcite are very important in the actual experiments .",
