    "dittmann had noted @xcite `` that in affine coordinates ( e. g. using the pauli matrices for @xmath11 ) the [ bures ] metric becomes very complicated for @xmath11 and no good parameterization seems to be available for general @xmath1 '' . in the first part of this two - part paper @xcite , we attempted to fill this lacuna , by deriving the @xmath12 bures metric tensor making use of a recently - developed euler - angle parameterization of the @xmath13 density matrices @xcite .",
    "six euler angles ( denoted @xmath14 ) , used in parameterizing an element of @xmath15 , are employed .",
    "additionally , two ( independent ) eigenvalues ( @xmath16 ) of the @xmath13 density matrices enter into this `` schur - schatten''-type parameterization of the @xmath13 density matrices @xcite .",

    "several of the tensor elements were then , in fact , found to be identically zero .",
    "( the @xmath12 matrix tensor decomposes into a @xmath18 block and a @xmath19 one , in correspondence to the six euler angles and the two independent eigenvalues . )",
    "however , we were not able to report concise symbolic expressions in @xcite for _ all _ the tensor elements .",
    "subsequent to the issuance of part i @xcite , we have further pursued the analytical matters there , managing to derive symbolic expressions in relatively concise form for all the entries of the @xmath12 bures metric tensor ( @xmath20 ) , as well as its inverse ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "several of the entries , however , particularly two in the inverse , remain rather relatively cumbersome in nature , so far resisting further simplification . by way of illustration , making use of the leafcount command in mathematica to measure the complexity of an expression , the largest leaf count ( that is , the `` total number of indivisible subexpressions '' ) for any single one of the @xmath20 s is 352 , while the largest for any of the @xmath21 s is 233 , aside from the two relatively complicated ones , having scores of 921 and 1,744 .",
    "we note here that all these entries prove to be _ independent _ of the euler angle @xmath22 .",
    "additionally , introducing the transformation @xmath23 , all the entries also become independent of the euler angle @xmath24 .",
    "( the entry with the largest leaf count is @xmath25 , and the second largest , @xmath26 . ) therefore , the two tensors are fully parameterizable with _ six _ , rather than eight variables .",
    "this reduction in dimensionality is exploited in the numerical integrations reported below .",
    "we noted that the two expressions ( both symmetric in @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 frequently occurred in the tensor elements .",
    "these two expressions are displayed in figs . 1 and 2 , making use of the transformation employed in @xcite : @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "for example , @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 in the two @xmath18 ( euler angle ) blocks of the bures metric tensor and its inverse , the identically zero elements are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    the volume element of the bures metric , in particular for the case @xmath3 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 has been determined from certain general considerations @xcite .",
    "we were then able , using this formula as a test , to numerically validate our calculations of the @xmath20 s to a very high degree of accuracy .",

    "this disparity is clearly a matter of convention , depending upon what sign is designated for the ricci tensor .",

    ", he has written : `` tentatively , the puzzle you mentioned ( i. e. the yang - mills functional for the ( anti ) self - dual field is larger than for the full field ) could stem from the problem of constructing a topological term using numerical methods . in the analytic world",
    "the difference between @xmath108 and @xmath109 is topological in the sense that its variation with respect to the connection vanishes .",
    "so , locally a minimum of @xmath110 is also a minimum of the original yang - mills action , and @xmath108 should be larger than @xmath111 provided @xmath52 and @xmath112 belong to the same topological class ( namely the topological term has the same value ) . in numerical computations , however , manifestation of topological invariance for an integral might not be as easy as in the analytic world",
    ". it could be the case that when @xmath52 is changed into @xmath112 , the value of the `` topological term '' is also changed . in that case",
    "the argument in the analytic consideration would be no longer valid .",
    "thus a naive suggestion is that during comparison between @xmath108 and @xmath111 numerically , one should also monitor possible changes in the topological term , to rule out the possibility that @xmath52 and @xmath112 are not really in the same topological class . ''",
    "so , it appears that it would be of interest in this matter to , in addition to our other computations , attempt to numerically approximate the term @xmath113 in ( [ gt25 ] ) by itself , as well as with @xmath52 replaced in it by @xmath114 as well as @xmath112 .",

    "it remains for us to attempt to solve the first of the two sets of equations in ( [ bdk ] ) , that is the dirac equation , together with the coulomb gauge condition .",
    "what we have considered to be the `` anti - self - dual '' part ( @xmath121 ) of the yang - mills field over the eight - dimensional convex set of three - level quantum systems satisfies the `` set @xmath127 '' of twenty - one equations in @xcite , @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 that is , to the _ negative _ eigenvalue , -3 , of a fourth rank tensor invariant under @xmath132 .",

    "the strongly self - dual 2-forms , hence the solutions of set @xmath136 saturate various topological lower bounds  , but they form an overdetermined system  we show that the solutions of set @xmath136 for an @xmath137-dimensional gauge group , depend exactly on @xmath137 arbitrary constants , provided that the system is consistent .",
    "thus the set @xmath136 lacks the rich structure of the self - duality equations in four dimensions . on the other hand , the solutions of set @xmath24",

    "`` in fact , one often finds in the literature that [ our ] equations ( [ keee ] ) and ( [ kee ] ) are referred to as the self - duality and anti - self - duality equations respectively .",

    "self - duality and anti - self - duality correspond to which way the division algebra @xmath138 acts : if on the left or on the right , and are hence related by a change of orientation on the manifold .",

    "solutions to these self - duality equations are provided by manifolds of @xmath115 holonomy @xcite , which are necessarily ricci - flat .",
    "the holonomy group is then 21-dimensional .",
    "acharya and oloughlin replaced the field strengths in the self - dual yang - mills equation @xmath143 by the components @xmath10 of the curvature two - form ( as we have above ) .    using the technique of embedding the spin connection in the gauge connection ( cf .",
