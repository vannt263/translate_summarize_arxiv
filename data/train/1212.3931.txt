    "the goal of this paper is to study rellich type estimates for some elliptic systems by using the first order formalism introduced in @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling the classical lax - milgram existence theorems of variational ( or energy ) solutions for divergence form second order partial differential equations and make clear how we understand them in unbounded domains .",
    "it is well - known that both neumann and regularity problems have unique solutions in the energy class .",
    "we reformulate this using the @xmath3 formalism in order to represent these solutions via a semi - group .",
    "we then obtain factorisations of the dirichlet to neumann map and of its inverse in @xmath4 topologies which are related to ( abstract ) boundary layer potentials .",
    "this part is completely general and true for any such elliptic system .    in the last part",
    ", we assume that the coefficients are block triangular ( see below for definition ) .",
    "although such an assumption is rather restrictive , it brings up a phenomenon which we think interesting on its own . using these factorisations , we prove that , in the triangular situation which corresponds to making the conormal derivative proportional to the transversal derivative , the neumann to dirichlet map is bounded in the @xmath0 topology , that is , solutions ( we shall make clear the meaning of solutions ) satisfy half of the boundary rellich estimate @xmath5 which implies that the neumann problem with @xmath0 data is solvable . for the adjoint situation",
    ", it is the dirichlet to neumann map that is bounded on @xmath0 , hence the opposite rellich inequality for solutions @xmath6 holds so that the regularity problem with @xmath0 data is solvable . in each case",
    ", we do not know about boundedness of the inverse , that is , we do not know the other half of the rellich estimate ( and we do not expect it by any means ) which is the alluded to phenomenon : usually rellich estimates are proved both ways .",
    "we also show that the dirichlet problem with @xmath0 data is solvable in the same block triangular situation as for the neumann problem .",
    "we remark that the conjunction of the two situations is the block - diagonal case for which @xmath7 is known to be equivalent to the kato square root estimate @xcite .",
    "as the reader might notice , a feature of our proof is the use of one equivalent formulation of the kato square root estimate ( for an auxiliary operator ) which shows a tight connection between rellich estimates and @xmath8 technology .    in a subsequent paper of two of us ( the first and third named author ) with s. hofmann",
    ", neumann solvability results for hardy space data are obtained in the triangular situations of this paper in the case of systems of such pde s satisfying the de giorgi regularity condition .",
