    "many social , technological , and biological networks belong to a common scale - free ( sf ) structure @xcite which consists of many low degree nodes and a few high degree nodes called as hubs .",

    "in addition , these real networks are classified into assotative and disassortative networks @xcite . for examples , typical social networks , e.g. coauthorships and actor collaborations ,",
    "are assotative , while typical technological and biological networks , e.g. internet , world - wide - web , protein - interaction , and food webs , are disassortative . in assotative networks ,",
    "nodes with similar degrees tend to be connected , and thus positive degree - degree correlations appear . in disassotative networks",
    ", nodes with different degrees : low and high degrees tend to be connected , and thus negative degree - degree correlations appear .    through the above findings in network science , superior network theories and efficient algorithms have been developed for analyzing network topology and dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , studies for the cases with degree - degree correlations are not clear enough for successful analysises of topological structures and epidemics on networks except some percolation analysises . recently",
    ", it has been numerically and theoretically found that an onion - like structure with positive degree - degree correlations gives the nearly optimal robustness against hub attacks in an sf network @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the average behavior of stochastically generated network models or empirical data samples of real networks is discussed in many applications .",
    "usually , some characteristic quantities such as degree distribution or clustering coefficient are investigated for a network , then their quantities are averaged over the samples of networks in which the existence of a generation rule ( mechanism ) of the networks is assumed . in this paper , we focus on the beforehand averaged network structure over samples , and calculate the degree distribution for several models of growing network with or without degree - degree correlations . this representation will give a general framework for numerically investigating the characteristic topological quantities in growing networks . since our framework is supported by the interesting property of ordering that older nodes tend to have higher degrees in a randomly growing network @xcite , a wide range of application to growing networks can be expected .",
    "we consider a set of growing networks in which a new node is added with probabilistic links to existing nodes in a network at each time step .",
    "to study the average behavior of the stochastic processes in many samples , we use the ensemble average of adjacency matrix defined as follows .",
