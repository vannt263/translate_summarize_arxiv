    "at present , graphite and its electronic properties attract considerable attention due to the discovery of novel carbon - based materials such as fullerenes and nanotubes constructed from wrapped graphite sheets .",
    "@xcite besides , thin films of graphite give promise of device applications .",
    "@xcite the attention to graphite is also caused by specific features of its electron energy spectrum which result in interesting physical effects .",
    "@xcite the electronic spectrum of graphite is described by the slonzewski - weiss - mcclure ( swm ) model , @xcite and values of the main parameters of this model were found sufficiently accurately from an analysis of various experimental data ; see , e.g. , the review of brandt _",
    "et al_. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the fermi surface of graphite consists of elongated pockets enclosing the edge hkh of its brillouin zone ( see figures below ) .",
    "these pockets are formed by the two majority groups of electrons ( e ) and holes ( h ) which are located near the points k and h of the brillouin zone , respectively .",
    "there is also at least one minority ( m ) low - concentration group of charge carriers in graphite , and this group seems to be located near the point h. however , it is necessary to emphasize that in spite of the considerable attention attracted to graphite an unresolved problem concerned with its spectrum still exists .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in the edge hkh of the brillouin zone of graphite , two electron energy bands are degenerate , and in a small vicinity of the edge these bands split linearly in a deviation of the wave vector @xmath0 from the edge .",
    "in other words , the edge is the band - contact line .",
    "but , it was shown in our paper @xcite that if in the @xmath0-space a closed semiclassical orbit of a charge carrier surrounds a contact line of its band with some other band ( and lifting of the degeneracy is linear in @xmath0 ) , the wave function of this carrier after its turn over the orbit acquires the addition phase @xmath1 as compared to the case without the band - contact line .",
    "this @xmath2 is the so - called berry phase , @xcite and it modifies the constant @xmath3 in the well - known semiclassical quantization rule @xcite for the energy @xmath4 of a charge carrier in the magnetic fields @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cross - sectional area of the closed orbit in the @xmath0 space ; @xmath8 is the component of @xmath0 perpendicular to the plane of this orbit ; @xmath9 is a large integer ( @xmath10 ) ; @xmath11 is the absolute value of the electron charge , and the constant @xmath3 is now given by the formula:@xcite @xmath12 when the magnetic field is applied along the hkh axis , orbits of electrons and holes in the brillouin zone of graphite surround this axis .",
    "thus , one might expect to find @xmath13 for these orbits instead of the usual value @xmath14 ( the values @xmath13 and @xmath15 are equivalent ) .",
    "a value of @xmath3 can be measured using various oscillation effects and in particular , with the de haas - van alphen effect .",
    "@xcite for example , the first harmonic of the de haas - van alphen oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility has the form , @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is some extremal cross section of the fermi surface of a metal in @xmath8 , a positive @xmath19 is the amplitude of this first harmonic , and @xmath20 is its phase which is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 for a minimum and maximum cross - section @xmath18 , respectively , and @xmath23 in the case of a two - dimensional fermi surface . @xcite",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) that one has to obtain @xmath24 for the maximum cross - sections of the electron and hole majorities in graphite .",
    "however , the phases @xmath25 , @xmath26 measured long ago @xcite agree with the usual value @xmath27 ; see table i.    recently a new method of determining the phase @xmath20 of the de haas - van alphen oscillations was elaborated , @xcite and the authors of that paper found @xmath13 for the cross section of the hole majority in graphite .",
    "however , in this determination they assumed the fermi surface of the holes to be two - dimensional ( @xmath28 ) ; see table i. besides this , they found @xmath27 for the maximum cross section of the electron majority , assuming the three - dimensional fermi surface for this majority ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "although the obtained value @xmath13 for the holes agrees with the above prediction , the results of ref .",
    "give rise to the following new problems : first , since the band - contact line in graphite penetrates both the electron and hole extremal cross sections , these cross sections must have the same @xmath3 .",
    "second , using the values of the parameters of swm model , @xcite one might expect that in graphite the electrons and holes of the extremal cross sections are both three - dimensional .    in this paper",
    "we show that in graphite , apart from the band - contact line coinciding with the edge hkh , _ three additional _ band - contact lines exist near this edge .",
    "the existence of these lines leads to the usual value @xmath27 for the maximum cross sections of the electron and hole majority groups in graphite .",
    "in other words , we resolve the above - mention contradiction between the theoretical value of @xmath3 and the data of refs .  .",
    "we also discuss the data of ref .  .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,>,^,^,>,>,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "when the magnetic field @xmath5 is directed along the @xmath30 axis , the maximum electron cross section in @xmath31 is located at @xmath32 , while the maximum cross section of the hole majority is between the points k and @xmath33 , viz .",
    ", at @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fermi energy in graphite , see fig .  2 .",
    "thus , both these cross sections are penetrated by the four band - contact lines .",
    "however , an _ even _ number of the band - contact lines do not change @xcite the usual value @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath14 for the maximum cross sections of the majority groups , which agrees with the experimental results of refs .  .",
    "we now discuss briefly the value of @xmath3 for the minority group . for the parameters presented in table",
    "ii , the hole minority is located near the point h and it results from the band @xmath36 . at this point",
    "the minority and the hole majority produced by the band @xmath37 have equal cross sections when the magnetic field is along the hkh axis . since no contact lines of the bands @xmath36 and @xmath37 penetrate this common cross section",
    ", one might expect to find the usual value @xmath14 in this case .",
    "however , the semiclassical approximation which is used in deriving eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) fails for the hole orbits corresponding to this cross section since for this approximation to be valid , the orbits must be sufficiently far away from each other .",
    "the analysis carried out beyond the scope of the semiclassical approximation @xcite led to @xmath13 and @xmath23 for the `` degenerate '' orbit . in experiments this orbit is ascribed to the hole minority , and the phase @xmath38 measured in ref .",
    "agrees with these @xmath3 and @xmath39 , see table i.    in ref .",
    "a new method was developed to determine the phase @xmath20 of the de haas -van alphen oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the appropriate results for @xmath20 and @xmath3 in graphite are presented in table i. however , authors of ref .   implied in their analysis of @xmath3 that the sign of @xmath19 in formula ( [ 3 ] ) is positive in the case of electrons and negative for holes .",
    "this is not correct ; the sign is always positive .",
    "a re - examination of the derivation of the lifshits - kosevich formula @xcite proves this statement .",
    "@xcite with this in mind we have corrected @xmath39 and @xmath3 of ref .  , and the obtained results are also presented in table i.    for the hole minority and for the electron majority @xcite the corrected results coincide with those of williamson _ et al_.@xcite ( but @xmath40 can be caused by the above - mentioned degeneracy of the hole orbits rather than by the two - dimensional spectrum of the hole minority ) . for the hole majority the phases @xmath26 measured in refs .   and",
    "the phase @xmath41 obtained by lukyanchuk and kopelevich @xcite means that either the spectrum of these carriers is two dimensional , or if @xmath42 , one obtains @xmath43 .",
    "however , in the semiclassical approximation , @xmath3 can be equal to @xmath44 or to @xmath45 only .",
    "@xcite intermediate values can occur in situations close to the magnetic breakdown .",
    "@xcite in principle , such the situation is possible for the swm model , but it does not occur for the parameters presented in table ii .    the parameters of table ii correspond to three dimensional spectrum of graphite and lead to a consistent description of the experimental data @xcite obtained many yeas ago .",
    "however , lukyanchuk and kopelevich @xcite used the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) with very high ratio of the out - of - plane to basal - plane resistivities ( @xmath46 ) , and in this sample , quantum - hall - effect features were observed which indicate a quasi two dimensional nature of this hopg .",
    "@xcite it was also argued @xcite that in similar samples of hopg an incoherent transport occurs in the direction perpendicular to the graphite layers , and the three dimensional spectrum of carriers seems to fail .",
    "if this conclusion is valid only for the hole majority , it could explain the above - mentioned disagreement .",
    "this also means that the parameters of swm model should be reconsidered to describe the spectrum of such hopg .    to conclude",
    ", the phases of the de haas - van alphen oscillations in graphite were measured in refs .  . the data of refs .",
    "can be completely explained in the framework of the known band structure of graphite @xcite if one takes into account that four band - contact lines exist near the hkh edge of its brillouin zone .",
    "the data of lukyanchuk and kopelevich @xcite obtained for hopg disagree with the experimental results of refs .   for one of the two large cross sections and probably imply that a reconsideration of the energy - band parameters for such hopg is required ."
