    "in conditions where the established theory of hadronic physics , namely quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , can not be solved we use a variety of models to explain the hadronic properties . to test these models , we can compare them with numerical simulations of qcd , like those through the lattice gauge theory , and available results of hard experiments .",
    "( the effort remains to use these discrete tests of continuum models for improvements in the models so as to get better agreements in the next comparisons .",
    "this is an important route of advancing our understanding of the hadronic physics and qcd . )",
    "such hard experiments could be cross sections , decay rates , masses and @xmath1 ( angular momentum , parity and c - parity ) combinations of hadrons . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive list of phenomenological implications in the charmonium sector , in form of masses , radii and wave functions at origin for a variety of @xmath1 assignments , of a model previously proposed @xcite by us for hybrid mesons .",
    "this model is an extension of the quark potential model to incorporate the knowledge of the gluonic excitations provided by lattice gauge theory ; this analytic model was noted to have a very good agreement with the corresponding lattice gauge theory based numerical results .",
    "if this qcd - motivated model can explain properties of newly discovered mesons including many hybrid candidates , this should be a useful advancement in our understanding of the gluonic excitations and , in general , of the physics beyond in the quark model . in our quest for comprehensiveness , we address the radial and orbital excitations along with the previously worked out @xcite radially ground state gluonic excitations ( hybrids ) and try to explain the properties of the newly discovered mesons in the charmonium sector mentioned below .    in general , an important guide to the search of physics beyond the quark model are meson @xmath1 combinations like @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xcite not satisfying the quark model formulas @xmath4 and @xmath5 . amongst the theoretical options to understand such exotic mesons , hybrid is an important option with often some expected features predicted through the existing models of hybrids or numerical simulations of the excited gluonic field in qcd .",
    "guided by theoretical signatures for hybrids , it is not uncommon to find experimentalists specifically searching for hybrid mesons : cern compass has been @xcite centered on hybrid meson structure studies , along with pion polarizability .",
    "progress on this project is reported , for example , in @xcite .",
    "hybrid interpretations of some results form @xmath6-factories has been discussed in @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite discussed then available experimental evidence for exotic hybrid mesons and described the gluex experiment in hall d of jefferson laboratory as a new initiative for performing detailed spectroscopy of the light - quark meson spectrum .",
    "this collaboration aims to investigate the full spectrum of mesonic states upto roughly 3 gev including hybrid candidates ; the photoproduction in it promises to be rich in hybrids , starting with those having exotic quantum numbers .",
    "hence this experiment has been expected to provide detailed spectroscopy necessary to map out hybrid meson spectrum which is essential for an understanding of the confinement mechanism and the nature of the gluon in qcd .",
    "this primary motivation of gluex has been re - stated in more recent proposals @xcite as to search and ultimately study the pattern of gluonic excitations in the meson spectrum produced in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "the spectroscopic searches for the exotic hybrid states such as @xmath8 system in the cleo - c research program @xcite .",
    "the panda ( antiproton annnihilation at darmstadt ) experiment features a scientific programme devoted @xcite to charmonium spectroscopy and gluonic excitations ( hybrids , glueballs ) , along with some other topics .",
    "this experiment performs studies of the strong interaction via precision spectroscopy of charmonium and open - charm states , an extensive search for exotic objects such as glueballs and hybrids , in - medium and hypernuclei spectroscopy , and more .",
    "@xcite says ",
    "the research of charmonium and charmed hybrids using the antiproton beam with momentum ranging from 1 gev / c to 15 gev / c in panda experiment at fair is perspective and interesting from the scientific point of view .",
    "charmonium and charmed hybrids with different quantum numbers are copiously produced in antiproton - proton annihilation process . \"",
    "@xcite says that for the panda experiment  its set - up allows physicists to address questions like the structure of glueballs and hybrids , to clarify the nature of the x , y , and z states \" and other related ones .",
    "this also tells that crystal barrel searched for hybrids with the exotic quantum numbers @xmath9 .",
    "many exotic mesons are suggested to be hybrids .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite mentions three experimental candidates for a light @xmath10 hybrid : @xmath11 , observed by e852 , ves , and crystal barrel experiment , @xmath12 , observed by e852 and ves , and @xmath13 observed by e852 ; see also the ref .",

    "@xcite proposes that a structure at 2175 mev observed by the babar collaboration is a @xmath15 strangeonium hybrid .",
    "the first paper of ref .",
    "@xcite above and refs .",
    "@xcite interpret @xmath16 as a @xmath17 hybrid . amongst the possible interpretations of the recently discovered @xmath18 mesons ,",
    "hybrid option is commonly advocated ; see refs .",
    "@xcite .    as mentioned above , it is because of the theoretical work on hybrids that we know how to interpret or not an exotic meson as a hybrid , though this type of work needs improvements both in terms of more specific predictions and clearer relationship with qcd .",
    "available studies include , in addition to the ones mentioned in the above paragraph , those through the flux - tube model  @xcite ,  @xcite-@xcite , qcd string model  @xcite , the quark model with a constituent gluon  @xcite-@xcite , the lattice qcd  @xcite-@xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite-@xcite , using many - body coulomb gauge hamiltonian  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "testing models of qcd and our understanding of qcd effects , as well as interpreting the recent meson spectrum , all point towards the significance of charmonium system .",
    "for example , barnes says @xcite `` charomonium system is an excellent laboratory for studyding non - perturbative effects such as confinement and gluonic excitations '' and `` identification of complete hybrid multiplet , especially @xmath1 exotics , would be a crucial contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of gluonic excitations . ''",
    "ketzer says in ref .",
    "@xcite `` to avoid experimental difficulties in the light quark sector due to the high density of ordinary @xmath19 states below 2.5 gev@xmath20 , a search for hybrids in the less populated charmonium mass region is expected to be very rewarding . ''",

    "a possible approach to take advantage of all the theoretical approaches to understand hybrid mesons is to use the numbers generated by lattice simulations of qcd ( for discretized configurations of quarks and antiquarks ) to constrain form and parameters of a continuum model that is motivated directly or indirectly by qcd .",
    "once that is done , we can compare the model with the results of actual hard experiments .",
    "the phenomenological implications we report result from fitting to the lattice result an explicitly written extension of the quark potential @xmath21 whose use is @xmath22 limited to finding properties of the ground state hybrid mesons ; @xmath23 is the relative vector a quark and antiquark . like any potential model , the relation of the model to qcd",
    "can perhaps be most easily seen through what is termed the born - oppenheimer approach already used in hadronic physics in ref .",
    "@xcite and later in refs .",
    "@xcite  @xcite : taking energy of the quickly adjusting gluonic field , found through the numerical lattice simulations of qcd , to be our adiabatic quark - antiquark potential @xmath21 , we first fit its parameters .",
    "then we solve the resulting schr@xmath24dinger equation for a set of possible quantum numbers of quark anti - quark ( for all cases ) to calculate the meson energies and wave functions ; for hybrid we used the additional term @xcite in our potential and considered quantum numbers of the gluonic field as well .",
    "the result has been the directly testable implications for the hadronic physics we report .    in our earlier work  @xcite , properties of conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons were studied for radially ground state using an extended quark model .",
    "the investigation of radial excitations of mesons and hybrid mesons is of great interest in hadron physics . in refs .",
    "@xcite few radial excited states of conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons were predicted , though not with any potential model ; ref .",

    "we calculate the masses , sizes , and radial wave functions of ground and radial excited state conventional ( @xmath25 @xmath26,@xmath27 , @xmath28 , .... ) and hybrid charmonium states such as @xmath29 @xmath1 states .",
    "this present work is the extension of our previous work  @xcite . using the radii form factors  @xcite energy shifts  @xcite ,  @xcite , and magnetic polarizabilities  @xcite can be found for conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons .",
    "the decay constants  @xcite ,  @xcite decay rates  @xcite ,  @xcite , and differential cross sections  @xcite for quarkonium states can be calculated using the radial wave function at the origin .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii , the potential model used for conventional mesons is written . then using this potential model , radial wave functions for the ground and radially excited state conventional charmonium mesons",
    "are found by numerically solving the schr@xmath24dinger equation .",
    "the expressions used to find masses , root mean square radii , and radial wave functions at the origin for conventional charmonium mesons are also written in this section . in section iii",
    ", the potential model is written for hybrid mesons , and then we accordingly ( i.e. for hybrids ) redo all the numerical work as done in section ii .",
    "results for the masses , root mean square radii and square of radial wave functions at the origin for the radial and orbital ground and excited states of conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons are reported in section iv .",
    "based on these results , we also include some results related to experimentally measurable quantities . in section",
    "iv , xyz- particles are related with different states of charmonium mesons based on similar mass and @xmath1 states where available .",
    "for the conventional mesons , we use the following quark anti - quark effective potential  @xcite @xmath30 , \\label{p24}\\ ] ] where the first term is due to one gluon exchange with quark - gluon coupling constant @xmath31 , second is linear confining potential with string tension @xmath32 , third term is the gaussian - smeared hyperfine interaction , and the last term is for the spin orbit potential with @xmath33/2,\\ ] ] and @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are quantum numbers of the relative orbital angular momentum of quark - antiquark and the total spin angular momentum of the meson respectively . the spin - orbit potential and the tensor term  @xcite are both zero for the angular @xmath37 . the parameters used in this potential for the charm quark and anti - quark are taken to be @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev as in refs .",
    "these values are obtained from the fit of the masses of 11 experimentally known @xmath42 states mentioned in the last column of table 1 below . in the third term , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the reduced mass of the quark and antiquark , and @xmath45 is the mass of the charm quark .",
    "the values of quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath36 which we choose for our study are reported in table 1 below . in the quark model ,",
    "the characteristics of a conventional meson can be described by the wave function of the bound state of quark - antiquark and in the above mentioned b.o .",
    "approximation this wave function @xmath46 can be found by solving the radial schr@xmath47dinger equation given as @xmath48 @xmath49 is the radial wave function and @xmath50 is the interquark distance .",
    "here @xmath51 is the sum of kinetic and potential energy of quark - anti - quark system . in this non - relativistic approximation ,",
    "especially justified for heavy mesons , the mass of a @xmath42 state is obtained after the addition of constituent quark masses in the energy @xmath51 .",
    "we found the numerical solution of the schr@xmath47dinger equation using the shooting method .",
    "earlier  @xcite we used this method to find the numerical solutions for radially ground state ( i.e for @xmath52 ) .",
    "now we extended this work of ref .",
    "@xcite by finding the normalized solutions for radially ground and excited states ( i.e for @xmath53 ) .",
    "the numerical solutions were obtained by regularizing the @xmath54 term ( of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) by adding a parameter @xmath55 to @xmath50 in the denominator whose value is taken small enough not to affect the equation for @xmath50 values away from the origin .",
    "this remedy is obviously required only for the mesons for which @xmath56 . as a check on our calculation",
    ", we confirmed that our results for the charmonium meson masses for ground and radially excited states agree with the table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the black curves in figs . 1 to 4",
    "show the radial wave functions @xmath49 of charmonium mesons for different values of @xmath57 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "four panels in each fig . correspond to four values of @xmath52 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 respectively and",
    "four black curves in each panel correspond to four possible values of @xmath61 corresponding to each value of @xmath35 , which are taken 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 in figs . 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 respectively .",
    "the exception of two black curves in each panel of fig . 1 arise because for @xmath37 the quantum number @xmath61 can have only two possible values .",
    "we noted that for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath49 decrease exponentially at large inter quark distances .",
    "the number of nodes in a radial wave function is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "it is also noted that peaks come closer to origin as we go to higher radially excited states . and",
    "by increasing @xmath35 , the wave function s peak goes away from the origin .",
    "but the wave functions are essentially insensitive to the @xmath36 values .",
    "one possible reason is that for our heavy quarks the @xmath65 factor ( appearing in eq . ) of the hyperfine term becomes very small .",
    "the normalized wave functions are then used to calculate root mean square radii and radial wave functions at origin using the following relations : @xmath66 @xmath67 radial wave function at origin is used in many applications of high energy physics as mentioned in section i.",
    "to describe hybrid mesons in bo approxiamtion , we used the static potential @xmath68 in place of @xmath69 of eq .",
    "( [ p24 ] ) : @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the gluonic potential whose functional form varies with the level of gluonic excitation . this potential and the corresponding gluonic states",

    "however , the @xmath75 states also require the sign  of parity under reflection in the plane perpendicular to quark anti - quark axis for their unique specification .",

    "now , considering the expected phenomenological challenges in forceable future , we have extended this work  @xcite by calculating these properties for a rather comprehensive spectrum of conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons .",
    "we do this by including the radially excited @xmath1 states not addressed in the previous study . in table 1 , our calculated masses are reported for the ground and radially excited states of charmonium mesons along with the experimental and theoretical predictions of the other s works .",

    "<S> the quark potential model for mesons and its extension for hybrid mesons are used to study the effects of radial excitations on the masses , sizes and radial wave functions at the origin for conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons . </S>",
    "<S> these results can help in experimentally recognizing hybrid mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons are calculated for the ground and radially excited states using the shooting method to numerically solve the required schr@xmath0dinger equation for the radial wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the experimentally observed masses and theoretically predicted results of the other models . </S>",
    "<S> our results have implications for scalar form factors , energy shifts , and polarizabilities of conventional and hybrid mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of masses of conventional and hybrid charmonium meson with the masses of recent discovered xyz - particles is also discussed . </S>"
