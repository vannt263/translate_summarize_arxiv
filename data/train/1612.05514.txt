    "in this paper we introduce an infinite number of identities between determinants whose entries are hermite polynomials .",
    "the remarkable fact is that the identities involve determinants of different size .",
    "an example of such an identity would be given by    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes the @xmath2-th hermite polynomial and @xmath3 .",
    "the first two determinants are wronskian determinants , and this type of identities had already been shown in @xcite , and possibly known before . as we shall explain below , they are a particular case of the whole equivalence class described in this paper that involves a given partition and its conjugate partition .",
    "the third determinant in is not a wronskian , but can be constructed in a similar fashion and thus we have coined the name _ pseudo - wronskian _ for it .",
    "a pseudo - wronskian involves two sequences , one of ordinary hermite polynomials @xmath4 and one of conjugate hermite polynomials @xmath5 . the determinant is built by taking derivatives of the ordinary hermite polynomials as in the usual wronskian , but shifting upwards the degree ( which is almost an integration ) for the conjugate hermite polynomials .",
    "wronskian determinants are a key object in the theory of linear differential equations , but they also arise naturally when iterating darboux transformations in schrdinger s equation , as it was shown by crum @xcite , and has been used extensively in the theory of integrable systems known as the _ dressing method _ ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "darboux transformations are fundamentally related to exceptional orthogonal polynomials , @xcite , and it was precisely this research that motivated the results reported in this paper .",
    "the determinantal identities discussed here express an equivalence class of rational darboux transformations that lead to the same transformed potential up to a spectral shift , and the two families of entries ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) correspond to the two families of seed functions for state - adding and state - deleting rational darboux transformations in the harmonic oscillator .    at the schrdinger picture ,",
    "these equivalences had already been noticed by in the laguerre and jacobi cases by odake in @xcite , and by the authors in @xcite . the most convenient way to visualize the equivalence is by shifting the origin in a maya diagram , a type of diagram that was originally introduced by sato in integrable systems theory @xcite .",
    "they were applied to the context of darboux transformations and exceptional polynomials by takemura @xcite .",
    "wronskian determinants of hermite polynomials appear already in the work of karlin and szeg @xcite , who provide expressions for the number of real zeros of the wronskian of a sequence of consecutive hermite polynomials .",
    "those sequences for which the wronskian determinant has no real zeros were characterized by adler in @xcite , and the result for arbitrary sequences has been recently derived by garca - ferrero et al .",
    "@xcite , using oscillatory type arguments .",
    "the complex zeros of these wronskians of hermite polynomials display very intriguing symmetric patterns on the complex plane , @xcite .    beyond their obvious interest in sturm - liouville theory , wronskian determinants of classical polynomials play a role in the construction of rational solutions to nonlinear integrable equations of painlev type . the symmetry approach based on bcklund transformations of painlev equations developed by noumi and his collaborators ( see @xcite and references therein ) shows how to construct rational solutions by applying the symmetry group to a number of seed solutions .",
    "maya diagrams and partitions are also an essential part of their description . in particular , two families of rational solutions to @xmath6can be constructed using generalized hermite and okamoto polynomials , which can both be expressed as wronskians of specific sequences of hermite polynomials @xcite .",
    "we show how to apply our results to provide an alternative pseudo - wronskian representation of okamoto and generalized hermite polynomials , which happens to be more efficient in the former case .",
    "it is also possible to view the pseudo - wronskian determinants introduced in this paper as an extension of jacobi - trudi formulas in the theory of symmetric functions , @xcite .",
    "the original jacobi - trudi formulas express the schur polynomial @xmath7 associated to a given partition @xmath8 as a determinant whose entries are complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials , or as a determinant whose entries are elementary symmetric polynomials associated to the conjugate partition @xmath9 .",
    "jacobi - trudi formulas were already extended to include classical orthogonal polynomials in @xcite and lead to exceptional orthogonal polynomials in @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - wronskian determinants in this paper can be regarded as a generalization of jacobi - trudi formulas that involve not just the partition @xmath8 or its conjugate partition @xmath9 , but also mixed representations described by the durfee symbols introduce by andrews in @xcite .",
    "analogous results for the laguerre and jacobi classes , including appropriately defined pseudo - wronskians , will be presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : def ] we introduce the basic definitions and we review the connection between partitions and maya diagrams . in section [ sec : pw ] we show how to associate a pseudo - wronskian determinant to each labelled maya diagram and we prove the main theorem stating the proportionality of pseudo - wronskian determinants for all labelled maya diagrams in the same equivalence class . in section [ sec : min ] we address the problem of finding the minimal order pseudo - wronskian determinant in each equivalence class . finally , in the last two sections we apply our results to derive alternative and more efficient pseudo - wronskian representations of exceptional hermite polynomials and special polynomials related to rational solutions of painlev type equations .",
    "we define a maya diagram to be a set of integers @xmath10 that contains a finite number of positive integers , and excludes a finite number of negative integers .",

    "by contrast , an unlabelled maya diagram should be visualized as a sequence of filled and unfilled boxes , without a choice of origin . in this formulation ,",

    "it is convenient to represent a partition by means of a ferrer s diagram , a finite collection of points arranged in left - justified rows , with the row lengths in non - increasing order .",
