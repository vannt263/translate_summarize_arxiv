    "direct imaging surveys for resolved substellar companions are vital for studies of brown dwarfs and planets .",
    "these surveys provide measurements of the frequency of companions as a function of various physical properties , such as primary mass , companion mass , separation , and age , which in turn can be used to constrain the mechanisms by which substellar companions form .",
    "in addition , compared to their isolated counterparts , each newly uncovered companion represents a superior laboratory for studying the atmospheres and evolution of substellar objects because the age , distance , and metallicity of the primary , and hence the companion , are relatively easy to measure .",
    "a variety of criteria can be adopted for selecting primaries to search for companions .",
    "stars for which planets have been discovered through radial velocity monitoring and young nearby stars are particularly attractive categories to consider .",
    "several direct imaging surveys have focused on known extrasolar planetary systems @xcite , producing one companion that was initially described as a brown dwarf @xcite but later shown to be a white dwarf @xcite .",

    "the only known t dwarf companions to stars consist of gl  229  b @xcite , gl  570  d @xcite , gl  337  d @xcite , @xmath10  ind  b and c @xcite , and scr  1845  b @xcite , all of which orbit nearby stars that are older than @xmath11  gyr and have no known planets .",
    "most resolved substellar companions have been identified through deep , high - resolution imaging at small separations ( @xmath12 ) with adaptive optics or the _ hubble space telescope _ or through shallow imaging at arbitrarily large separations with the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) or the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . because of its wide field of view ( @xmath13 ) and unprecedented sensitivity at mid - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",

    "we measured photometry and astrometry of all point sources appearing in the reduced images of each star .",
    "we then identified candidate t dwarf companions by comparing these data to the colors of known t dwarfs @xcite , which are highly distinctive from those of other astronomical sources .",
    "we did not search for m and l dwarf companions because their irac colors do not differ significantly from those of stars at earlier types .",
    "we also considered only candidates that had magnitudes that were consistent with the absolute magnitudes of known t dwarfs when placed at the distance of the primary .",

    "these data encompass the candidate companion to this star that we have found with irac . according to analysis",
    "that was kindly performed by g. bryden , the candidate is not detected in those 24  data . extrapolating from the irac data with a rayleigh - jeans distribution , the expected 24  flux from the candidate is @xmath24  mjy while the noise in the 24  image is about twice this value .",
    "these relatively shallow observations were designed to detect an excess above the stellar photosphere of hn  peg rather than a faint companion .",
    "we obtained near - ir spectra of the candidate t dwarf companions to hn  peg and hd  3651 with the spectrometer spex @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on the nights of 2006 june 15 and 30 .",
    "the instrument was operated in the prism mode with a @xmath25 slit , producing a wavelength coverage of 0.8 - 2.5  and a resolution of @xmath26 . for each candidate",
    ", we obtained 20 exposures distributed between two positions along the slit .",

    "the camera contained a @xmath27 aladdin 2 insb array and had a plate scale of @xmath28  pixel@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "imaging was performed through mauna kea observatory ( mko ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 filters @xcite . in each filter",
    ", we obtained one 30  s exposure at each of nine dithered positions .",
    "for the @xmath32-band imaging of the candidate companion to hd  3651 , we performed this cycle twice .",
    "images for a given candidate and filter were median combined to produce a flat field image , which was then divided into the original exposures .",
    "point sources in these images exhibited fwhm@xmath33 .",
    "we extracted photometry for each candidate companion with the task phot under the iraf package apphot using a radius of eight pixels .",

    "the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 measurements for the two candidate companions are presented in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "when a candidate companion is identified in direct imaging of a star in the solar neighborhood , the standard method of definitively assessing its status as a binary companion consists of checking whether it shares the same proper motion as the primary . to apply this method to the two candidate t dwarfs from our irac images of hn  peg and hd  3651 , we needed an image of each object obtained at a second epoch .",
    "the candidate companion to hn  peg was detected in each of the three 2mass bands and appears in the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the candidate near hd  3651 is not in the 2mass point source catalog , but through visual inspection of the images , we find that it was detected in @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    to measure the proper motion of each candidate , we identified sources that appear in both the irac and the 2mass images and measured their right ascensions and declinations in the 4.5  image of irac and in the 2mass band in which the candidate companion has the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath31 for hn  peg and @xmath30 for hd  3651 ) .",
    "the differences between the irac and 2mass coordinates for these objects are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : pm1 ] and [ fig : pm2 ] .",
    "the relatively small number of stars in each diagram is a reflection of the requirement of a detection by 2mass ; the numbers of sources detected by the irac images are much larger . to correct for a small offset between the coordinate systems of the irac and 2mass images",
    ", we applied constant shifts to the right ascension and declination differences so that their average values were zero .",
    "in other words , we assume that the average proper motion of stars surrounding each star is zero . for comparison ,",
    "we include in figs .",
    "[ fig : pm1 ] and [ fig : pm2 ] the expected displacements of hn  peg and hd  3651 during the time interval between the 2mass and irac observations ( @xmath34 and 6.8  years ) based on their known proper motions @xcite . in each of the two diagrams ,",
    "one source exhibits a motion that is significantly non - zero and that is consistent with the expected motion of the primary .",
    "these two objects are the candidate t dwarfs that we found with irac .",
    "thus , these data demonstrate that both candidates have common proper motions with the primaries , which conclusively establishes their companionship . hereafter in this paper , we refer to these new companions as hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b. the positions of hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b relative to their primaries are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "2mass and irac images of these systems are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hnpeg ] and [ fig : hd3651 ] .      in ",
    "[ sec : phot ] , we identified hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b as possible t dwarfs based on their mid - ir colors and magnitudes .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] and [ fig : spec2 ] , our near - ir spectra of both companions exhibit methane absorption , which is the defining spectral feature of t dwarfs @xcite . to measure the precise spectral type of each companion , we visually compared these spectra to the spex data for t dwarf standards that were presented by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] , we find that the spectrum of hn  peg  b agrees well with the average of the spectra of sdss  1254 - 0122 ( t2 ) and 2mass  1209 - 1004 ( t3 ) .",
    "the match is clearly worse with either of these standards alone .",
    "therefore , we assign a spectral type of t2.5@xmath35 to hn  peg  b.    although the overall spectrum of hn  peg  b is fit well with standard t dwarfs , the k  i absorption lines at 1.25  appear to be weaker in hn  peg  b than in the standards . in comparison , these lines become weaker with lower gravity for late - m and early - l dwarfs @xcite but grow stronger with lower gravity at late - t types @xcite .",
    "based on the apparent youth of its primary (   [ sec : age ] ) , hn  peg  b should have a lower surface gravity than the standard t dwarfs in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "thus , these data for hn  peg  b seem to indicate that the gravity dependence of the k  i lines is the same in early t dwarfs as it is in m and l dwarfs .",
    "however , because the spectral resolution of our data is too low for reliable measurements of these lines , a spectrum at higher resolution is needed to explore this issue definitively .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spec2 ] , we compare hd  3651  b to 2mass  0727 + 1710 ( t7 ) and 2mass  0415 - 0935 ( t8 ) and the average of the two standards . the differences between hd  3651  b and each of these three spectra are subtle , but close examination of each comparison indicates that the average of t7 and t8 provides the best match to hd  3651 .",
    "for instance , the width of the continuum at 1.2 - 1.3  , the depth of the absorption at 1.6 - 1.8  , and the level of the @xmath32-band flux are all best fit by the average of t7 and t8 .",
    "therefore , we measure a spectral type of t7.5@xmath35 for hd  3651  b.        now that hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b have been confirmed as companion t dwarfs , we examine their physical properties .",
    "because these t dwarfs are companions , we can assign to them the ages and distances of their primaries , which are bright , well - studied stars in the solar neighborhood . as a result ,",
    "the ages and distances of these t dwarfs , and hence the masses , radii , and temperatures , are better constrained than those of isolated t dwarfs .",
    "we adopt the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric distances of @xmath36 and @xmath37  pc for hn  peg  a and hd  3651  a , respectively @xcite .",
    "hn  peg  a appears to be a young solar analog based on its activity , x - ray emission , rotation , li abundance , and kinematics @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the li measurements for hn  peg  a @xcite to li data for solar - type members of the pleiades and hyades open clusters and the ursa major moving group @xcite indicates that hn  peg  a is probably older than the pleiades ( @xmath38 - 125  myr , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and these open clusters @xcite produces the same result .",
    "the chromospheric activity of hn  peg  a suggests an age of @xmath42 - 0.4  gyr @xcite .",
    "a debris disk was recently detected around hn  peg  a at 30 and 70  by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , which tends to further support the youth of this star . meanwhile , hd  3651 is probably older than the sun considering its fairly long rotational period ( p=48  d , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated an age of 5.9  gyr from its chromospheric activity and @xcite reported an isochronal age of @xmath43  gyr .",
    "based on these age constraints , we adopt ages of @xmath44 and @xmath45  gyr for the hn  peg and hd  3651 systems , respectively .      to measure the bolometric luminosities of hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b , we first used the @xmath46 photometry to flux calibrate the 0.8 - 2.5   spectra .",
    "for each object , we constructed a spectral energy distribution that consisted of these calibrated spectra , the irac photometry ( 3.2 - 9.2  ) , a linear interpolation of the fluxes between 2.5   and 3.2  , and a rayleigh - jeans distribution longward of 9.2  . by summing the flux in each distribution and correcting for distance , we measured log  @xmath47 and @xmath48 for hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b , respectively .",
    "our luminosity measurement for hn  peg  b is greater than the value produced by combining its @xmath32 magnitude with the bolometric corrections ( bc@xmath49 ) that have been previously measured for t2-t3 dwarfs @xcite .",
    "for instance , the bolometric luminosity for the t2 dwarf sdss  1254 - 0122 from @xcite implies bc@xmath50 .",
    "if we combine this value of bc@xmath49 with our @xmath32 measurement for hn  peg  b and an absolute bolometric magnitude for the sun of @xmath51 , we arrive at log  @xmath52 . to explore the source of the difference in these two luminosity estimates ,",
    "we compare in figure  [ fig : colors ] the near- and mid - ir colors of hn  peg  b to colors of t dwarfs compiled by @xcite .",
    "the 2mass measurements from @xcite have been transformed to the mko system @xcite . in the diagrams of colors versus spectral type in figure  [ fig : colors ] ,",
    "hn  peg  b is similar to other t dwarfs near its spectral type in terms of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55-[4.5]$ ] , and @xmath56-[5.8]$ ] , but it is redder by @xmath42 and @xmath57  mag in @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59-[8.0]$ ] , respectively .",
    "the latter difference is not significant because of the large photometric error in @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "however , hn  peg  b clearly has redder @xmath61irac colors relative to typical field dwarfs , which explains why the luminosity derived from @xmath32 and bc@xmath49 was lower than the value measured from the photometry and spectra .",
    "in other words , if we reduced the irac fluxes of hn  peg  b by @xmath62% so that its @xmath61irac colors were consistent with those of other t2-t3 dwarfs like sdss  1254 - 0122 , then our luminosity measurement would agree with the one based on @xmath32 and bc@xmath49 .",
    "our luminosity measurement for hd  3651  b agrees well with the value produced by combining its @xmath32 magnitude with bc@xmath49 for t7-t8 dwarfs from @xcite . in addition , the near- and mid - ir colors of hd  3651  b are consistent with those of the other t dwarfs shown in figure  [ fig : colors ] .",
    "we use theoretical evolutionary models to convert our luminosity and age estimates for hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b to masses , effective temperatures , and radii .",
    "we perform this conversion by plotting these companions on diagrams of luminosity versus age and comparing their positions to lines of constant mass , temperature , and radius that are predicted by evolutionary models .",
    "these diagrams are presented in figs .  [",

    "we have presented the discovery of two t dwarf companions in the solar neighborhood , hn  peg  b ( t2.5 ) and hd  3651  b ( t7.5 ) .",
    "these t dwarfs are the sixth and seventh known t dwarf companions to stars and are the first t dwarfs discovered with the _ spitzer space telescope_. in this section , we describe additional notable aspects of these new brown dwarfs .",
    "hn  peg  a has been the target of high - precision radial velocity monitoring @xcite and near - ir coronographic imaging @xcite , but no companions have been found through those observations .",
    "hn  peg  b was bright enough to be detected by the imaging of @xcite , but it was outside of their field of view ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this companion was also beyond the field of view of unpublished images of hn  peg obtained with the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ during general observer program 10176 .",
    "various data from the literature indicate that hn  peg  a has an age of 0.1 - 0.5  gyr (   [ sec : age ] ) . if the t dwarf s  ori  70 @xcite is a field dwarf rather than a member of the young cluster @xmath71  ori @xcite , then hn  peg  b may be the youngest known t dwarf .",
    "hn  peg  b closely resembles the recently discovered late - l companion to hd  203030 in terms of age and mass @xcite .",
    "several properties of hn  peg  b do not behave in the manner predicted for young , low - gravity t dwarfs .",
    "although the colors within the @xmath46 bands and within the irac bands are normal , all colors containing one of the former and one of the latter are redder than those of typical t dwarfs by @xmath42  mag (   [ sec : lbol ] ) . in contrast , low gravity should cause these colors to become bluer , not redder , according to the theoretical spectra of @xcite . based on its position in color - magnitude diagrams , hn  peg  b",
    "is probably not an equal - component binary , but it could be a binary with two unequal components , which suggests that it could be a binary .",
    "this brown dwarf was identified as a possible binary because of its bright @xmath30 magnitude relative to late l dwarfs @xcite , but more recent 1 - 5  measurements indicated that it might not be significantly overluminous compared to other t dwarfs @xcite . ] .",
    "because later t dwarfs emit proportionately more flux in the mid - ir bands than at shorter wavelengths , an unresolved system of this kind ( e.g. , t1+t5 ) might be responsible for these anomalous colors .",
    "another possible explanation is photometric variability between the dates of the irac and @xmath46 observations @xcite .",
    "our estimates of the stellar parameters of hn  peg  b also exhibit peculiarities .",
    "when we compare the luminosity and age of hn  peg  b to the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models , we derive an effective temperature of @xmath72  k , which is lower than the values previously measured for t dwarfs at t2-t3 ( @xmath73  k , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the spectral modeling of late t dwarfs by @xcite found that temperature should increase rather than decrease with lower gravity at a given spectral type . if this prediction is combined with the models shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bur97 ] and [ fig : bar03 ] , then a young t dwarf should be much brighter than an older one at the same spectral type . instead",
    ", we find that hn  peg  b is at the faint end of t0-t4 dwarfs @xcite and is at least one magnitude fainter in bolometric luminosity than expected for its assumed age .",
    "one possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the hn  peg system is much older than various data for the primary seem to indicate (   [ sec : age ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite have recently reported the same anomalous behavior for a late - l companion near another star that appears to be young , hd  203030 , and it seems unlikely that the age estimates for both stars have such large errors . instead , the presence of this phenomenon in both hn  peg  b and hd  203030",
    "b strongly indicates that the temperature of the l / t transition is dependent on surface gravity , and in a manner that has not been previously predicted .",
    "when combined with the evolutionary models , the luminosity and age of hn  peg  b translate to a mass @xmath6  @xmath8 , making it one of the least massive known t dwarfs .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of t dwarf companions to the nearby stars hn  peg ( g0v , 18.4  pc , @xmath0  gyr ) and hd  3651 ( k0v , 11.1  pc , @xmath1  gyr ) . during an ongoing survey of @xmath2 fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with the infrared array camera aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ , we identified these companions as candidate t dwarfs based on their mid - infrared colors . using near - infrared spectra obtained with spex at the nasa infrared telescope facility </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm the presence of methane absorption that characterizes t dwarfs and measure spectral types of t2.5@xmath30.5 and t7.5@xmath30.5 for hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b , respectively . by comparing our _ spitzer _ data to images from the two - micron all - sky survey obtained several years earlier , we find that the proper motions of hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b are consistent with those of the primaries , confirming their companionship . </S>",
    "<S> hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b have angular separations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 from their primaries , which correspond to projected physical separations of 795 and 476  au , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of their luminosities to the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xmath8 for hn  peg  b and hd  3651  b. in addition , the models imply an effective temperature for hn  peg  b that is significantly lower than the values derived for other t dwarfs at similar spectral types , which is the same behavior reported by metchev & hillenbrand for the young late - l dwarf hd  203030  b. thus , the temperature of the l / t transition appears to depend on surface gravity . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , hd  3651  b is the first substellar companion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close - in planet from radial velocity surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of this companion supports the notion that the high eccentricities of close - in planets like the one near hd  3651 may be the result of perturbations by low - mass companions at wide separations . </S>"
