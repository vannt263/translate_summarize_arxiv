    "antiferromagnets with strong geometrical frustration are fascinating systems which can display a variety of exotic magnetic phases different from conventional nel ordering@xcite . recently , frustrated systems with strong quantum fluctuation have been attracting much attention from a view point of the interplay of quantum fluctuation and spin frustration .",
    "@xmath9 kagom antiferromagnet ( kaf ) is a typical example of such systems .",
    "there are many theoretical works on the @xmath9 kaf . by virtue of careful analyses and numerical simulation ,",
    "it has been predicted that the ground state of @xmath9 kaf is quantum spin liquid as resonating valence bond state ( rvb ) , and that there are huge number of singlet excitations which fill up the triplet excitation gap@xcite .",
    "however , this intriguing prediction has not been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "the experimental study of the @xmath9 kaf is limited because of few model substances .",
    "three compounds [ cu@xmath10(titmb)@xmath0(ch@xmath1co@xmath0)@xmath11@xmath12h@xmath0o@xcite , cu@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath13(oh)@xmath142h@xmath0o@xcite and @xmath15-cu@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath16@xcite are known to have kagom lattice or closely related lattices .",
    "however the kagom net is distorted into an orthorhombic form in cu@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath13(oh)@xmath172h@xmath0o , and buckled like staircase in @xmath15-cu@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath16 , so that the exchange network is anisotropic . for [ cu@xmath1(timb)@xmath0(ch@xmath1co@xmath0)@xmath11 @xmath12h@xmath0o ,",

    "these compounds are crystallized in trigonal structures ( space group @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "cuf@xmath21 octahedra are connected in the @xmath19-plane sharing corners .",
    "magnetic @xmath22 ions with @xmath9 form a regular kagom lattice in the @xmath19-plane , and all of the nearest neighbor exchange interactions are equivalent .",
    "cuf@xmath21 octahedra are elongated along the principal axes which are almost parallel to the @xmath19-axis , so that the hole orbitals @xmath23 of cu@xmath3 spread in the kagom layer .",
    "since the bond angle of superexchange @xmath24 in the @xmath19 plane is about @xmath25 , the nearest neighbor superexchange interaction @xmath26 through f@xmath27 ion in the kagom layer should be antiferromagnetic and strong .",
    "the interlayer exchange interaction @xmath28 should be much smaller than @xmath26 , because magnetic @xmath22 layers are sufficiently separated by nonmagnetic @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and f@xmath27 layers .",

    "@xmath33 with m@xmath18 zr and hf crystals were synthesized according to the chemical reaction @xmath34",

    "the materials were packed into pt - tube in the ratio of @xmath41 .",
    "single crystals of @xmath33 were grown by both vertical and horizontal bridgman methods .",

    "transparent colorless crystals were obtained .",
    "the crystals obtained were identified to be @xmath33 by x - ray powder and single crystal diffractions .",

    "figure 2 shows the inverse magnetic susceptibilities of @xmath42 and @xmath43 as functions of temperature measured for external field parallel to the @xmath19-axis . with decreasing temperature ,",
    "the susceptibilities increase obeying the curie - weiss law with large negative weiss constants , which is indicative of strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the weiss constants obtained for @xmath44 are listed in table 1 . the susceptibilities exhibit sudden jumps at @xmath6 k and 175 k for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . in both systems , the phase transition at @xmath45 has small hysteresis , which is indicative of the first order transition .",
    "the susceptibilities obey the curie - weiss law also below @xmath45 .",
    "these results indicate that the phase transition at @xmath45 is not of magnetic but of structural origin .",

    "the spontaneous magnetizations were observed at @xmath59 k , as listed in table 1 .",
    "the weak ferromagnetic moment for @xmath44 is much smaller than that for @xmath60 .",
    "the weak ferromagnetic moment is intrinsic to the present system , because its magnitude is strongly dependent on field direction and independent of sample .",
    "therefore , the rapid increase in the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures is originated from magnetic ordering with the weak ferromagnetic moment .    within the mean - field theory ,",
    "the weiss constant for the kagom lattice is related to the nearest neighbor exchange interaction as @xmath61 , where @xmath26 is defined as @xmath62 . from the weiss constants listed in table 1 , we obtain @xmath63",
    "k and @xmath64 k for @xmath42 , and @xmath65 k and @xmath66 k for @xmath43 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are exchange interactions above and below @xmath45 , respectively . in both systems , the exchange interactions are antiferromagnetic and strong .",
    "this is attributed to that the hole orbitals @xmath23 of cu@xmath3 spread in the kagom layer , and that the bond angle @xmath24 of about @xmath25 is much larger than @xmath69 and rather close to @xmath70 for which strong antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction can be produced @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature dependences of total specific heat in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "sharp peaks are observed at structural phase transition temperature @xmath6 k and @xmath71 k for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "peaks at @xmath45 are not @xmath72-like due to the first order transitions .     and ( b ) @xmath43 measured at zero magnetic field .",
    "insets show the enlargements of low - temperature specific heat in both systems.,width=566 ]    as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "3 , the specific heat exhibits small bend anomaly at @xmath73 k and 24.5 k for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "this anomaly is different from @xmath72-like and cusplike anomalies which are characteristic of the phase transition of the second order .",
    "the small specific heat anomaly is indicative of small change in the entropy at @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath74 increases with increasing applied field , e.g. , for @xmath43 , @xmath75 k at @xmath76 t. at present , the spin structure below @xmath74 is unclear .",
    "the ratio of @xmath77 to @xmath74 is approximately 10 for both systems .",
    "the large @xmath78 value implies the good two - dimensionality and the strong frustration in the present systems .",
    "vectors for @xmath79 in @xmath33 systems , ( a ) the @xmath19-axis component and ( b ) the @xmath19-plane component.,width=453 ]    next , we discuss the origin of the weak ferromagnetic moment .",
    "there is no inversion center at the middle point of two neighboring magnetic ions in the kagom lattice .",
    "this situation differs from that in the triangular lattice .",
    "thus , in general , the antisymmetric interaction of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) type , @xmath80 $ ] , is allowed . for the high symmetric crystal structure above @xmath45 in which the regular kagom lattice is realized , there are mirror planes that are parallel to the @xmath19-axis , cross the middle points of neighboring cu@xmath3 ions and are perpendicular to the lines connecting these ions .",
    "therefore , the @xmath81 vectors should be parallel to the mirror planes .",
    "since there are two - fold screw axes along the @xmath82 , [ 0 , 1 , 0]$ ] and @xmath83 $ ] directions , the @xmath81 vectors become antiparallel along these directions .",
    "thus , arrangement of the @xmath81 vectors should be as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in this case",
    ", if the nel ordering occurs , the dm interaction acts to stabilize the so - called @xmath84 structure and also gives rise to the weak ferromagnetic moment due to the canting of ordered moments .",
    "if the ground state is spin liquid as rvb state , the dm interaction acts to mix the excited triplet state into the ground singlet state , which leads to the magnetic ground state with finite susceptibility .",
    "although the details of the crystal structure below @xmath45 is not clear at present , we infer that the weak ferromagnetic moment observed below @xmath74 is attributed to the dm interaction , because the low - temperature crystal structure is expected to be closely related to the high - temperature crystal structure .",
    "we have presented the results of magnetization and specific heat measurements on the single crystals of @xmath42 and @xmath43 which are described as quasi-2d @xmath9 kagom antiferromagnet .",
    "both systems undergo structural phase transitions at @xmath6 k and 175 k , respectively .",
    "magnetic orderings accompanied with the weak ferromagnetic moment occur at @xmath73 k and 24.5 k for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . at present , the spin structure in the ground state is not clear .",
    "the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction that is generally allowed in the kagom lattice should be responsible for the weak ferromagnetic moment .",
    "for further discussion on the magnetic ground state , we need detailed data of the crystal structure below @xmath45 .",
    "the present systems are characterized as the @xmath9 kagom antiferromagnet with strong exchange interactions , @xmath85 k. therefore , novel magnetic excitations predicted by recent theory@xcite may be examined by neutron inelastic scattering just above @xmath45 where the regular kagom lattice is realized .",
    "the authors would like to thank i. yamada for useful suggestion on the sample preparation .",
