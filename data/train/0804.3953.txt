    ", the charge freed up by the absence of the vacuum - side bonds has to be redistributed , resulting in major changes in the elastic,@xcite magnetic,@xcite and other thermodynamic@xcite properties of the surface as compared to the bulk .",
    "often this results in structural modulations in order to minimize the energy and reduce the stress on the surface . on the other hand",

    "determination of surface stress , which is central to understanding self - organization processes on crystal surfaces , has proven to be a challenge .",
    "especially , the few studies that compare experiment and theory do not provide a systematic level of agreement .",
    "two such comparisons are on the change of surface stress upon oxygen adsorption on pt(111)@xcite and cu(100).@xcite in the first case , the calculation result is somewhat lower than the experimental one , whereas in the case of o / cu(100 ) the theory exceeds the experimental results by a factor as large as 3 . in a similar study , the calculation significantly underestimates the experiment on o / ni(100).@xcite the uncertainties are attributed to the sensitivity to the boundary conditions in the setup and the macroscopic nature of the measurement in the crystal bending experiments , by far the most popular technique regarding adsorbate induced surface stress , and the lack of convergence in the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations . therefore , additional means of measuring surface stress are very important .    to this end , one could consider the lattice relaxations upon stress release at a boundary . strain relaxation in finite - size objects is not surprising , as it is reasonable to expect that the boundaries ( be it one - dimensional or two - dimensional ) will assume a configuration minimizing the forces . indeed , pioneering experimental studies regarding the change of the lattice constant of tiny three dimensional crystallites were done in the early 1950s,@xcite and somewhat later the connection of this observation to surface stress was established.@xcite in these studies the contraction of small spherical metal crystals was explained through the radial forces applied by the surface to the inner part of the particles , laying out the basis for understanding our experimental observations .    regarding surfaces , there is a wide range of studies on elastic effects due to a variety of defects such as single atoms , atomic steps , and three dimensional adsorbate islands . within the general framework ,",
    "defects are modeled as local forces that induce long - range elastic relaxations on the surface and in the bulk ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the propagation of the displacements into the bulk has been demonstrated most notably by x - ray diffraction analysis.@xcite however , the relevant interactions are often confined to the most superficial layers , as in the case of o adsorbed on pt(110)-(1@xmath42).@xcite    following this argument , to a first approximation , an adsorbate island can be considered as a two - dimensional crystallite with a one - dimensional boundary . in the case of pseudomorphism , the adsorbate lattice locks on to that of the underlying crystal .",
    "however , for small monolayer islands , the stressed layer might be able to -at least partially- relax through its boundaries , and we can expect a mismatch between the adsorbate and the substrate .",
    "there is already experimental work pointing to such relaxations both on metals and on semiconductors , using real space imaging and diffraction techniques.@xcite on the theoretical side , recent simulations show deviations from pseudomorphic positions for small two - dimensional islands.@xcite    in this paper , we demonstrate that quantitative information on surface stress can be obtained by measuring such deviations from pseudomorphism as a function of the size of the monolayer adsorbate islands .",
    "we observe that small islands of oxygen on w(110 ) behave similarly to the cases mentioned above showing a mismatch to the underlying lattice , @xmath5 , depending on their size and the crystallographic direction within the surface plane . taking advantage of the distinct low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) spots corresponding to the p(@xmath0 ) order , we follow the changes in the average lattice spacing as a function of the average domain size obtained from the spot widths .",
    "we find a mismatch scaling as the inverse island size , @xmath2 , in the @xmath1 $ ] direction , while it is dominated by quadratic and higher order terms , @xmath6 , along @xmath3 $ ] . the lattice mismatch is explained as a strain relaxation , and it is described in terms of a frenkel - kontorova model . from this model , using calculated force constants , we extract the surface stress value along @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we have performed density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations in order to understand the nature of the oxygen induced surface stress change , obtained by modeling the observed strain relaxations in our measurements . while the early first - principles surface - stress calculations@xcite were mostly oriented towards the understanding of the microscopic origin of stress , some of the more recent ones@xcite are being directly compared to the experimental measurements of the surface stress change , with varying success .",
    "our _ ab - initio _ result agrees well with the stress value estimated from our model of the measured lattice relaxations in the @xmath1 $ ] direction .",
    "in addition , the qualitatively different scaling of the lattice mismatch along @xmath3 $ ] can be understood from our calculation results , which show a lack of a significant stress change in this direction and a strain - stress coupling between the two orthogonal directions .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the experimental setup and reports the leed results on oxygen adsorption on w(110 ) , section iii presents the model of lattice relaxation as a balls - and - springs chain , and in section iv , we describe the _ ab - initio _ calculations . in section",

    ", for a 5-layer slab .",
    "aside from having the correct atomic structure , stress values do converge much slower with the number of k - points than energies in the dft calculations , and the long - ranged elastic relaxations bring forth the necessity for larger slabs , which is the motivation behind the rather thick slabs used in our calculations .",
    "the semi - empirical potential calculations@xcite yield instead a surface stress of 2.4  n / m along @xmath1 $ ] and 0.3  n / m along @xmath3 $ ] , which differ significantly from the present _ ab initio _ results .",

    "as seen in table  [ tab : dft_stress ] , both our calculation and the crystal - bending measurement show that the relative stress is compressive along @xmath1 $ ] , while along @xmath3 $ ] the surface stress is affected negligibly upon oxygen adsorption . on the other hand , the surface stress change that we obtained by modeling the average lattice relaxation as a function of island size , @xmath26 } = -6.5 $ ]",

    "n / m from the calculation , especially considering the few parameters used in our model .",
    "the reason for the remaining difference between the quantitative estimate from the model chain and the calculated stress is attributed mainly to the simplifications of the model itself .",
    "most importantly , we have considered only the relaxations within the oxygen layer . as hinted by the modified tungsten atomic positions in the presence of oxygen",
    ", the relaxations in the adsorbate layer should continue into the tungsten surface , albeit with reduced magnitude .",
    "thus , a more accurate model should take into account layer - resolved stresses , with the lattice in each layer ( namely oxygen and the first layer tungsten ) having a different power law behaviour ( both with @xmath28 but each with a different coefficient , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this , although possible , would require a more precise measurement and a detailed analysis of the leed spot profiles .",
    "a quantitative comparison between the _ ab - initio _ calculations and the crystal - bending results from table  [ tab : dft_stress ] is less satisfactory , as the calculation is a factor four above the experimental value along @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this , although discouraging , illustrates the problems in the surface stress studies .",
    "one problem noted in the mentioned experimental study is the adsorption of oxygen also on the back side of their crystal , which should result in a reduction of the measured stress by about 25 % .@xcite in addition , as suggested in the introduction , part of the reason for the difference between experiment and theory is to be sought in the macroscopic nature of the crystal - bending measurements , since the presence of domain boundaries relieves the stress on the adsorbate covered surface .",
    "indeed , our leed analysis shows that even at 0.5 ml oxygen coverage , which corresponds to the best p(@xmath0 ) order , the oxygen lattice is relaxed along @xmath1 $ ] by as much as 0.5 % . at room temperature",
    ", this relaxation should be more pronounced due to the smaller domain sizes . as a consequence ,",
    "the surface stress in the adsorbed face of the crystal is lower than the value estimated from a calculation that considers a surface uniformly covered and free of defects .",
    "the surface quality of the crystal used in the experiments can also influence the results , as the surface stress would be reduced by the presence of defects such as steps or step - bunches .",
    "this problem was avoided in our @xmath8-leed measurements by choosing a region free of atomic steps .    regarding the strain relaxation processes",
    ", we have demonstrated that the behaviour along @xmath1 $ ] is consistent with what is expected from a harmonic chain sitting on a periodic potential .",
    "however , along @xmath3 $ ] the situation presents a qualitative difference as the power ( with which the relaxation scales inversely as a function of island size ) is much larger than 1 throughout the full range of oxygen coverages .",
    "additionally , the mismatch along @xmath3 $ ] is much smaller than that along @xmath1 $ ] except for the smallest island sizes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figuremismatch ] ) . as we have noted earlier , these observations suggest that the lattice relaxation along @xmath3 $ ] is a consequence of the @xmath1 $ ] relaxation , yielding a higher - order effect in @xmath29 . indeed , as seen in table .  [",
    "tab : dft_stress ] , our calculations predict no noticeable difference between the clean and oxygen - covered w(110 ) surface stress in the @xmath3 $ ] direction .",
    "we suggest that the lattice change along @xmath3 $ ] is induced by the strain - relaxations taking place in the @xmath1 $ ] direction for small - sized islands .",
    "we find support for this explanation when we extend the calculation to a slab that is stretched slightly along @xmath1 $ ] in order to model the strain relaxation .",
    "in particular , we have performed a calculation for a slab stretched uniaxially by 1.5 % along @xmath1 $ ] . in this case",

    "n / m.@xcite as expected , along @xmath1 $ ] the relative stress decreases as the compressed lattice relaxes upon stretching . on the other hand , along @xmath3 $ ] a tensile stress appears as the lattice is stretched in the orthogonal direction .",
    "this strain - stress coupling between the two directions is therefore believed to be the driving force of the lattice changes along @xmath3 $ ] .    a similar analysis as in eq .",
    "[ eq : eqn2 ] can give us more insight on the power law behaviour observed along @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "if the driving force is the relaxation along @xmath1 $ ] , the regions in which the contraction in @xmath3 $ ] occurs must be limited to what can be described as the `` corners '' of an island .",

    "one issue that we have ignored in the discussion of the spot profiles and relaxations is related to the island size and shape distribution .",
    "in general the boundaries of oxygen islands do not run simply along @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "stm studies of low oxygen coverages show a variety of island shapes possibly elongated in the @xmath34 directions.@xcite however , from our two - dimensional leed spot profiles , we were able to determine only a mean elongation along @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "in addition to the shape , the details of the island size distribution depend on the oxygen coverage.@xcite it is plausible that a coverage dependent change in the asymmetry of this distribution would modify the power law of the apparent ( or mean ) strain relaxation .",
    "we have measured the lattice relaxations within oxygen islands on w(110 ) by low - energy electron diffraction .",
    "the half - order diffraction spots of the p(@xmath0 ) order within the oxygen covered regions allowed the observation of the mismatch to the substrate lattice as a function of the average island size . along",

    "this provides support to our explanation that the qualitatively different behaviour in the @xmath3 $ ] direction is an effect induced by the lattice relaxation along @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we believe that , with a more sophisticated analysis of the integral order leed spot profiles , the semi - quantitative strain - relaxation model described in this paper can be generalized to study the surface stress in a wide range of adsorbate systems and ultra - thin films .      the derivation of eq .",
