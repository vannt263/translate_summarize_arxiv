    "<S> ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at an energy @xmath0 are studied in a three - dimensional fluid dynamical model . </S>",
    "<S> the results of a hydrodynamical evolution using the pic - method are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the importance and diagnostic value of a proper reaction plane determination is emphasized , and the time development of collective observables is presented .    [ [ introduction ] ] introduction : + + + + + + + + + + + + +    fluid dynamical ( fd ) models are widely used to describe ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> their advantage is that one can vary flexibly the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter and test its consequences on the reaction dynamics and the outcome . in energetic collisions of large heavy ions , </S>",
    "<S> especially if qgp is formed in the collision , one - fluid dynamics is a valid and good description for the intermediate stages of the reaction . here , interactions are strong and frequent , so that other models have limited validity . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the initial and final , freeze - out ( fo ) , stages of the reaction are outside the domain of applicability of the fluid dynamical model .    </S>",
    "<S> the equations of perfect fd are just the local energy , momentum and baryon number conservation laws , where we assume local equilibrium , so that the energy - momentum tensor is given by the eos . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the most important and almost only input is the eos .    of course the initial and final ( fo- ) </S>",
    "<S> conditions are also vital , and the deviations from thermal equilibrium ( viscosity and dissipation ) are also important . here , though , we will concentrate on the impact of the initial condition .    as pointed out above </S>",
    "<S> , the equations of perfect hydrodynamics are the conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> still , the approach additionally assumes a local thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> if this is present , intensive macroscopic space - dependent quantities such as temperature , @xmath1 , chemical potential , @xmath2 , and pressure , @xmath3 , can be defined . </S>",
    "<S> an equation of state has to be introduced , which gives a relationship between energy- and baryon number density and the pressure : @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary to have a complete , solvable set of equations . after introducing the shear viscosity , @xmath5 , and the heat conductivity , @xmath6 , a state near equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> can also be described .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ the - pic - model ] ] the pic model : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the particle in cell ( pic ) method was developed by amsden and harlow in the early 1960s @xcite and upgraded to ultra - relativistic energies by nix and strottman in the 80s and 90s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the method takes advantage of a combination of eulerian and lagrangian solution methods ; the pressure is calculated on an eulerian grid , while all current transfers are calculated in a larger number of lagrangian cells , the so - called `` marker particles '' .    </S>",
    "<S> the method has numerous advantages ( e.g.  keeping conserved quantities constant ) , and a typical main disadvantage , the development of `` ringing instabilities '' in rapid expansion or explosion . </S>",
    "<S> this has recently been eliminated by assigning the marker particles random positions to avoid structures , along which an instability would start to develop . with this upgrade the stability of expansion </S>",
    "<S> is increased , so that a spherical object remains exactly spherical ( within the numerical resolution ) even after a volume increase by a factor of more than 100 .    </S>",
    "<S> after upgrades , the code can follow the fluid dynamical expansion even well beyond the physical applicability of fd . </S>",
    "<S> this extended fd history can then be used to analyse the effects of choices on the fo hyper - surface , or on the fo layer ( a 4-volume domain ) .    a code with finite cell - size exhibits necessarily a numerical viscosity and coarse graining . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy lost in this averaging is thermalized just as in nature . </S>",
    "<S> no additional constraint is enforced to conserve the entropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical viscosities are in the range of the estimated physical viscosity @xcite , if the reaction is not too peripheral , in which case the applicability of fd is not the best anyway . </S>",
    "<S> the larger than realistic viscosities in the transverse direction dissipate more transverse flow to heat , so we get higher @xmath1 and higher thermal smearing .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ the - initial - state ] ] the initial state : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +        the initial shape is calculated in an effective 1d yang - mills coherent field model , where the transverse plane is split up to `` streaks '' like in the `` firestreak''-model of the 1970s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> projectile and target matter interpenetrate each other initially in the collision , exchange color charge and form `` strings '' which expand until all initial kinetic energy is converted to string tension . </S>",
    "<S> no transverse momentum exchange is taken into account among the streaks in this initial stage , but a longitudinal expansion at the edges of the strings was included in the expansion to make the surface at the initial moment ( when the fd starts ) smoother .    </S>",
    "<S> the streaks expand until the initial kinetic energy is converted fully into string tension . </S>",
    "<S> we use an effective string tension of @xmath7 , which was deduced from earlier string model fits to experimental cern - sps results . </S>",
    "<S> this results in moderately long streaks of @xmath8 , so that the thickness of the initial state is rather a flat than an extremely long object parallel to the beam direction .    </S>",
    "<S> while in the middle of the transverse plane in the cm frame the matter is at rest , the edges on the projectile and target side have projectile- and target - directed excess momenta , which lead to a skewed object at the end of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the longer the formation of initial state lasts , the more skewed this initial state becomes ( ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ non - existing - symmetry - and - event - plane - reconstruction ] ] non - existing symmetry and event - plane reconstruction : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    although both nuclei involved in the collision of two gold beams are of equal size and mass , there is no forward - backward ( f / b)-symmetry . in each event </S>",
    "<S> a clear distinction between projectile and target hemisphere must be made . </S>",
    "<S> it is trivial to see that a single - event particle distribution following from an initial state of finite impact parameter as described above , is not f / b - symmetric but deviates from this by a certain angle @xmath9 in the x / z - plane ( see ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the event - plane reconstruction is not done for its f / b - orientation , these effects are lost .    the aforementioned effect , the _ third flow component _ </S>",
    "<S> , has been predicted as a signature of the qgp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be visible in the special behaviour of the directed flow coefficient @xmath10 , which is supposed to be closer to zero at central rapidities than the usual linear increase of @xmath11 vs. rapidity , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is measurable at around midrapidity @xcite    especially correlation measurements , but also flow determinations , must be aware of this fact . </S>",
    "<S> two - particle correlations showing basically two peaks at @xmath13 and @xmath14 do not take the real geometry into account . </S>",
    "<S> taking a sample over events with randomly identified f / b event planes obscures the advent of interesting physics .    </S>",

    "<S> this leads to a distribution of matter and energy density in an ellipsoid shape in very late stages of the collision , which is enhanced in the direction of the original pressure gradient . </S>",

    "<S> the presence of the third flow component is well visible in the former . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be seen that both directed and elliptic flow coefficients approximately double their magnitude between the two times .    </S>",
    "<S> all flow plots are calculated assuming massless quarks in a qgp - phase . in evaluating the flow during the hydro evolution </S>",
    "<S> we take advantage of the observed @xmath18-scaling . </S>",
    "<S> it should further be noted that all flow plots are calculated at constant time hypersurfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course not including freeze - out and hadronization , but it allows us to study effects of different initial conditions during the hydro evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a larger @xmath11 than in experimental data @xcite , because , we neither performed a fo calculation through a realistic fo hypersurface , nor an impact parameter averaging . </S>",
    "<S> both these processes make the distributions smoother and decrease @xmath11 and @xmath19 . </S>",
