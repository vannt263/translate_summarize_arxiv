    "the present paper elaborate the @xmath7 structure of compound poisson spaces ; we note that for all of this compound poisson processes the results of @xcite immediately produce gelfand triples of test and generalized functions as well their characterizations and calculus .",
    "the analysis on pure poisson spaces was developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and many others from different points of view .",
    "in @xcite we have developed methods for non gaussian analysis based on generalized appell systems . in the case of poisson space , this coincide with the system of generalized charlier polynomials , however the desirable extensions to compound poisson and for example gamma processes are trivial .",
    "let us describe this construction more precisely .",
    "we recall that the poisson measure @xmath8 ( with intensity measure @xmath9 which is a non - atomic radon measure on @xmath10 ) is defined by its laplace transform as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dual of @xmath13 ( @xmath14-functions on @xmath15 with compact support ) .",
    "an additional analysis shows that the support of the measure @xmath8 consists of generalized functions of the form @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dirac measure in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the configuration space over @xmath21 i.e. , @xmath22 the configuration space @xmath20 can be endowed with its natural borel @xmath9-algebra @xmath23 and @xmath8 can be considered as a measure on @xmath24    let us choose a transformation @xmath25 on @xmath26 given by @xmath27 then the normalized exponential or poisson exponential @xmath28 is a real holomorphic function of @xmath29 on a neighborhood of zero @xmath30 on @xmath31 its taylor decomposition ( with respect to @xmath29 ) has the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 it follows from the above equality that for any @xmath34 @xmath35 the function @xmath36 is a polynomial of order @xmath37 on @xmath24 this is precisely the system of generalized charlier polynomials for the measure @xmath38 see subsection [ 2eq61 ] for details .    this system can be used for a fock realization .",
    "@xmath39 has a fock realization analogous to gaussian analysis , i.e , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the n - fold symmetric tensor product of @xmath42    the `` poissonian gradient '' @xmath43 on functions @xmath44 which has specific useful properties on poisson space , is introduced on a specific space of `` nice '' functions as a difference operator @xmath45 the gradient @xmath43 appears from different points of view in many papers on conventional poissonian analysis , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "we note also that the most important feature of the poissonian gradient is that it produces ( via a corresponding integration by parts formula ) the orthogonal system of generalized charlier polynomials on @xmath46@xmath47 see remark [ 2eq62 ] .",
    "in addition we mention here that as a tangent space to each point @xmath48 we choose the same hilbert space @xmath49    we conclude section [ ref21 ] with the expressions for the annihilation and creation operators on poisson space . in terms of chaos decomposition nualart and vives",
    "@xcite proved the analogous expression of the creation operator , in this paper we give an independent proof which is based on the results on absolute continuity of poisson measures , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , details can be found in subsection [ 2eq63 ] .",
    "the analysis on compound poisson space can be done with the help of the analysis derived from poisson space described above . that possibility is based on the existence of an unitary isomorphism between compound poisson space and poisson space which allows us to transport the fock structure from the poisson space to the compound poisson space .",
    "the above isomorphism has been identified before by k. it , @xcite and a. dermoune , @xcite .",
    "all this is developed is subsection [ 2eq64 ] .",
    "the images of the annihilation and creation operators under the above isomorphism on compound poisson space are worked out in subsection [ 2eq65 ] .",
    "the aim of section [ 2eq66 ] is to study in more details the previous analysis in a particular case of compound poisson measure , the so called gamma noise measure .",
    "its laplace transform is given by @xmath50 this measure can be seen as a special case of compound poisson measure @xmath51 for a specific choice of the measure @xmath52 used in the definition of @xmath53 , see section [ 2eq66 ] - ( [ 2eq67 ] ) for details . from this point of view , of course , all structure may be implemented on gamma space .",
    "the question that still remains is to find intrinsic expressions for all these operators on gamma space as found in poisson space .",
    "the most intriguing feature of gamma space we found is its fock type structure . as in the poisson case it is possible to choose a transformation @xmath25 on @xmath26 such that the normalized exponentials @xmath54 produce a complete system of orthogonal polynomials , the so called system of generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "it leads to a fock type realization of gamma space as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a quasi-@xmath37-particle subspace of @xmath57 the point here is that the scalar product in @xmath58 turns out to be different of the standard one given by @xmath59 as a result the space @xmath60 has a novel @xmath37-particle structure which is essentially different from traditional fock picture .",
    "throughout this section we consider the measure space @xmath61 where @xmath9 is a non - atomic @xmath9-finite measure .",
