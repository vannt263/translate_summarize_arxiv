    "resistive pulse sensing has been demonstrated for the analysis of particle size down to particles a few tens of nanometers in diameter @xcite , and has been implemented with quite large measurement bandwidth , enabling particle detection at rates approaching @xmath0 particles / s @xcite . our high - speed nanoparticle analyzer @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , comprising a molded microconstriction ( mc ) , which when filled with saline has electrical resistance @xmath1 , a molded microfluidic bias resistor ( fr ) , with saline electrical resistance @xmath2 , and a metal electrode that capacitively senses the saline electrostatic voltage @xmath3 between the microconstriction and bias resistor .",
    "when the device is biased by an externally - applied voltage difference @xmath4 , and a particle passes through the microconstriction , the microconstriction resistance will increase by an amount @xmath5 that is proportional to @xmath1 and to the particle volume @xcite .",
    "this changes the electrostatic potential of the saline above the metal sense electrode by an amount @xmath6 in an optimally - designed circuit the mc and fr resistances are balanced , @xmath7 , and the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) is equal to @xmath8 . in the limit where the amplifier circuit connected to the electrode has infinite input impedance ,",
    "the voltage change at the amplifier input is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , yielding a large bandwidth voltage signal proportional to the particle volume .",
    "figure [ fig:1](b ) demonstrates the electrical detection of a single 1 @xmath9 m diameter polystyrene particle .",
    "it shows both the high sensitivity and the rapid electrical response of the device , corresponding to the short transient ( @xmath10s ) generated by the particle passage through the microconstriction .",
    "the amplitude of the voltage signal can be used to discriminate particle size , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) , showing signals generated by a mixture of 0.75 @xmath9 m and 1 @xmath9 m diameter polystyrene beads .",
    "two distinct signal amplitudes are visible in the time trace , which are accumulated to generate the histogram also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) .",
    "we actively displace particles using a pair of metal bimorph disc actuators , made from a lead zirconate - titanate piezoelectric material and purchased commercially .",
    "the actuators bend in a concave - up or concave - down fashion , determined by the sign of an externally applied voltage .",
    "these actuators are placed symmetrically on either side of the sorting region of the microfluidic device , each above a small volume of fluid connected by a narrow channel to the main channel through which particles pass ( see fig . [ fig:2](a ) ) .",
    "the actuators are used in a tandem push - pull arrangement , one driven by a voltage pulse with polarity chosen so that it pushes the underlying fluid , and the other driven by the opposite polarity voltage pulse , so that it pulls on the fluid underneath , motion that generates fluid flow with minimal static pressure change .",
    "when a particle passes through the sorting region of the device , these opposite polarity voltage pulses ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) are generated and applied to the actuators .",
    "the resulting pulse of fluid flow , transverse to the main channel flow in which the particle is entrained , displaces the particle towards one of the output channels .        the microfluidic device shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] was fabricated by molding polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) using a lithographically - defined mold made from photo - definable epoxy .",
    "the actuators were embedded in the pdms structure , with a very thin pdms layer separating the actuator from the fluid , thus yielding strong and efficient mechanical coupling to the fluid .",
    "we mounted the completed device on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope , with the active area of the device focussed through a dry objective onto the plane of a ccd camera .",
    "for the initial experiments we used fluorescent polystyrene beads , 0.5 @xmath9 m in diameter .",
    "the microfluidic channels were completely filled with either filtered saline or deionized water , and fluid flow was established by regulating the air pressure at each of the device ports .",
    "we then introduced the beads into the input port on the device , and used parallel flow in the two flow - focussing ports on either side of the input port to hydrodynamically focus the flow , yielding bead velocities of @xmath131 mm / s .",
    "the beads were sufficiently diluted prior to injection that only one bead passed through the active area of the device at a time .    to deflect a bead , two opposite - polarity electrical pulses with amplitude 1 - 5 v and duration 10 ms were applied to the transducers , generating the desired push - pull drag flow in the fluid channel connecting the two transducers .",
    "figure [ fig:2](c ) displays the resulting response of an individual bead to this kind of signal , with the bead directed to output port a. reversing the polarity of the signals would instead deflect the particle to output port c. in the absence of an actuation signal , particles would flow into the waste port b.",
    "we combined the electrical size analyzer and the micro - actuator to demonstrate all - electronic size - based sorting .",
    "we established pressure - driven flow of the analyte through the main channel of the device , using flow - focussing to maintain tight lateral spacing of the particles .",
    "particles passed one at a time through the size analyzer , resulting in the generation of an output pulse whose amplitude , proportional to the particle volume , was used to discriminate and drive the piezoelectric actuators .",
    "the microactuator flow pulse then directed the particle to the desired output port .",
    "the electrical schematic is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ; the electrical signal from the particle analyzer was discriminated and a trigger generated , after a programmable time delay , that was then amplified and used to drive the actuators .        in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) we show the results of a size - based sorting experiment , using a mixture of polystyrene beads with 0.75 @xmath9 m and 1 @xmath9 m diameters .",
    "the figure displays the input size histogram , color - coded for where the input particles were directed ( red for output a , green for output c ) .",
    "we mark also the size ( voltage ) at which the binary sort discriminator and trigger was set .",
    "a single pass through the device produces highly enriched outputs , with monodisperse populations achieving ( in this experiment ) 100% sorting fidelity at each output port , defined as the fraction of beads appearing at each output port that were intentionally directed there .",
    "the fidelity of the sorter is ultimately limited by variations in the particle speed and by insufficient drag force on some particles , both of which arise for particles near the bottom and top of the channel , where the poiseuille flow velocity and the micro - actuator induced drag both fall to zero .    very high speed sorting can be achieved using this microactuator design . figure [ fig:3](c ) shows the high - speed binary sorting of 1 @xmath14 diameter polystyrene particles , where we significantly increased the flow rate of particles over the previous experiments . the voltage pulse from the particle size analyzer",
    "was directly amplified to generate an actuation voltage that sent the first @xmath15 particles to output a. the actuation voltage was then shut off , and the next @xmath15 particles were directed to output b. red and green dots show the final positions of particles in the output region .",
    "an output fidelity of around 98@xmath16 was achieved , as shown in table [ table:1 ] . for the actuated particles , the actuation signal pulse width was about 500 @xmath9s , which corresponds to a maximum sorting speed of about 60,000 particles / min , assuming a 50% duty cycle .",
    "the sorting rate is limited in this case by the compliance of the actuators ; stiffer actuators would be required to achieve sorting speeds significantly higher than this .",
    ".size based sorting : results of sorting polydisperse particles with 0.75 and 1 @xmath9 m diameters , showing the number of beads in each output port as well as the sorting fidelity , defined in the text .",
    "[ table:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this experiment demonstrates a powerful and potentially useful application for this device , enabling the on - demand sorting of cells based on functional parameters or based on surface or internal marker expression , following which the sorted cells can be used for further study . in the fluorescence mode ,",
    "this device achieves a sorting throughput of @xmath136,000 cells / min with a fidelity of better than 95% , which is comparable to the results reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "this approach promises an alternative and significantly more flexible approach to cell sorting than is possible using conventional flow cytometry .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a fluorescence - based as well as a size - based high - speed microsorter , both implemented in a disposable microfluidic format .",
    "the two versions of the device enable discrimination of individual sub - micron particles and cells with good signal - to - noise ratio , which control an integrated push - pull micro - actuator , yielding a sorter that can be operated at high speed with high fidelity .",
    "the sorting scheme is label - free , and we have demonstrated the ability to perform binary sorts of both synthetic polystyrene beads as well as biological cells .    this concept can be extended to sort multi - component nanoparticle solutions . a multichannel output design can easily be configured to allow more complex configurations , combining both electrical and optical detection techniques as well as doing higher - order sorting , with different binary sort elements cascaded to allow multiplexed operation .",
    "a cascaded arrangement could also be used to correct sorting errors from previous sorting elements .",
    "it could also be possible to equip the ccd camera with a bayer mask or use a triple - ccd device , in order to obtain optical images of the cells , similar to imaging flow cytometry , but with added sorting capability .",
    "the low cost , scalable fabrication , and simple on - chip detection and sorting ability , make this device potentially useful in a wide range of applications .",
    "the micromold used to define the microfluidic sorter poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) structure was fabricated using two thicknesses of the photodefinable epoxy su-8 ( microchem corp . ) , patterned using optical lithography ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . the substrate consisted of a bare 100 mm silicon wafer onto which we defined gold alignment marks using a photoresist liftoff process .",
    "the thin regions of the micromold ( 2 @xmath9 m thick ) , which includes the fluidic resistor ( fr ) and microconstriction ( mr ) , were patterned first .",
    "the fluidic resistor was defined using 17 parallel ribs of su-8 , each rib 50 @xmath9 m long and 3 @xmath9 m wide .",
    "the microconstriction was a rib of su-8 2 @xmath9 m long and 2 @xmath9 m wide .",
    "the remaining , thicker portions of the microfluidic structure were defined following this , using thick ( 15 @xmath9 m ) su-8 .",
    "this mold was used to cast pdms , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , and could be reused to fabricate many pdms elements .",
    "once cast , the pdms was bonded to a clean glass slide that , for the size - based micro - sorter , included a sensing electrode ( 10 nm ti , 50 nm au ) , fabricated using a conventional photoresist liftoff process .",
    "the microfluidic channels were completely filled with either filtered saline or deionized water , and fluid flow was established by regulating the air pressure at each of the device ports .",
    "usually , in , ff1 and ff2 ports ( refer to figure [ fig:2](a ) ) were set to very similar values to create a pressure head on the analyte input side .",
    "the beads or cells were introduced into the in port on the device , ff1 and ff2 flow - focussing ports were used to hydrodynamically focus the input beads towards the out b port . on the other side of the microsorter , out a",
    ", b , c ports were set at lower pressure than in port , yielding the bead velocities of 1 mm / s .",
    "using the microactuator to successfully drive particles to the desired output port depends on transducer pulse amplitude , pulse timing as well as on the height of the particle in the channel . the time delay from detection to the actuation point is inversely proportional to velocity , so finding a pulse delay that works for the range of expected velocities is clearly necessary .",
    "the height of a particle in the channel determines its velocity , due to the poiseuille distribution of flow ; this also controls the effectiveness of the sorting flow pulse , which has the same poiseuille flow distribution , so that e.g. a slow particle will feel a smaller sorting force than a fast particle . as slower particles are in the sorting region proportionally longer than fast particles",
    ", the integrated impulse can be made almost independent of velocity . in order to achieve the highest fidelity actuation",
    ", we tuned each transducer s actuation voltage separately , and ensured that nearly the same end result could be achieved independent of the particle s measured horizontal velocity .",
    "figure [ fig:2](d ) shows part of the tune - up for the push mode actuation , in which the voltage applied to one actuator acting by itself was adjusted to give the same displacement as for the other actuator acting by itself ( red and green data points ) .",
    "this was verified by applying the same polarity pulse to each actuator , giving a net null displacement ( black data points ) .",
    "for example , for the device used here , we found the upper actuator ( a1 ) would balance the lower actuator ( a2 ) if we used pulses of amplitude @xmath17 v and @xmath18 v respectively , the difference in voltage reflecting a difference in the transducers or in how they were mounted .",
    "a similar tune - up procedure was used for the pull mode actuation .",
    "constant and opposite voltages @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( typically a few volts in amplitude ) were applied to bias electrodes a and b respectively ( fig .",
    "the bias voltages were adjusted in such a way as to keep the average sensor output voltage @xmath3 near zero , to avoid electrolytic corrosion of the sensing electrode . the instantaneous voltage @xmath3 was monitored and compared to a set threshold voltage , with voltages beyond the threshold triggering the sorter actuation .",
    "the trigger ( stanford research dg535 ) would in turn generate a square pulse of 10 ms duration and @xmath21 = 1 v amplitude , which was amplified by a dual - output amplifier ( krohn - hite 3602 m ) to generate positive and negative polarity pulses which were applied to the two pzt transducers .",
    "the voltages used to drive the pzts were tuned up as described above .      for fluorescence - based sorting , which was used designed to sort both fluorescent beads as well as biological cells with dimensions of order 10  @xmath9 m ,",
    "a much larger microfluidic design was used , where in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) and ( c ) the layout was scaled up uniformly by a factor of 10 from the microparticle sorter . in this implementation",
    ", the particles to be sorted were illuminated with a mercury lamp through a dapi filter cube , and the return fluorescent signal captured using a 60@xmath22 dry objective before illuminating a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera ( qicam 12-bit , 100 fps ) .",
    "the pixels in the ccd lying inside a software - defined rectangular `` region of interest '' ( roi ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , were digitally analyzed and summed in real time to evaluate the roi total intensity .",
    "when a bead passes through the roi , the summed intensity increases sharply , and this intensity is used to generate a software - programmable delayed trigger pulse on a function generator ( stanford research systems ds345 , square pulses of 10 ms duration and @xmath23 v amplitude ) .",
    "this pulse was amplified by a dual - output amplifier ( krohn - hite 3602 m ) to generate positive and negative polarity pulses with amplitudes as per the tune - up procedure described above .",
    "the opposite polarity pulses were applied to the two transducers , generating the desired push - pull drag flow in the channel connecting the two transducers . in the absence of an actuation signal",
    ", particles in the flow stream would flow into the waste port b in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the fidelity of this sorter , defined as the fraction of fluorescent beads that went to the desired output port , depends strongly on the timing between fluorescence detection and the actuation flow pulse , which required careful optimization due to the larger microfluidic dimensions as well as the use of software analysis and its concomitant delays .",
