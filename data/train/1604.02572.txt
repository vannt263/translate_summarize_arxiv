    "the explicit four loop values of the coefficients for generic fermion representations were generalised from the original references in @xcite while the explicit formulae for the coefficients are shown in the appendix of @xcite .",

    "the baryon operator is constructed out of three quarks . in general for the renormalization of composite operators one needs to consider operator mixing .",

    "from the figure it is clear that the 2-loop result is only accurate very close to the upper limit of the conformal window , i.e. @xmath17 , while the agreement between the 3- and 4-loop result suggests that the fixed point coupling so determined is reliable for a much wider range of number of flavors , i.e. @xmath18 .     at 4- , 3- and 2-loop order as a function of the number of flavors @xmath19 .",

    "in fact , the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass term @xmath22 have also been investigated on the lattice by several groups and for the purpose of this work we refer to the comprehensive review of these results presented in @xcite .",
    "although no universal consensus exists yet on whether or not the su(3 ) theory with @xmath24 has ir fixed point  @xcite , the lattice results measuring the anomalous mass dimension are compatible with the four loop results .",

    "the baryon anomalous dimension is very small @xmath25 , about a factor four smaller than the mass anomalous dimension .",

    ", we compare in various perturbative estimates .",
    "we use the 3- and 2- loop expressions for @xmath26 and for each we insert the value of the ir fixed point coupling at the same order in perturbation theory or one order higher . for @xmath23 ,",

    "the 2-loop estimate of the baryon anomalous dimension shows significant deviations respect to the other three estimates.this is consistent with the expectation that the 2-loop computation is reliable only very close to the loss of asymptotic freedom .",
