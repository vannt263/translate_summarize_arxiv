    "this paper explores the relation between geometric convexity , and geodesic connectedness of space - times and semi - riemannian manifolds .",
    "we consider geodesics of all causal types , since they form the scaffolding for the global topological and geometric structure of the space .    according to gibbons and ishibashi @xcite : `` convexity and convex functions play an important role in theoretical physics .",
    "for example , gibbs s approach to thermodynamics @xcite is based on the idea that the free energy should be a convex function .",
    "a closely related concept is that of a convex cone which also has numerous applications to physics . perhaps the most familiar example is the lightcone of minkowski spacetime . equally important",
    "is the convex cone of mixed states of density matrices in quantum mechanics .",
    "convexity and convex functions also have important applications to geometry , including riemannian geometry @xcite . it is surprising therefore that , to our knowledge , that [ sic ] techniques making use of convexity and convex functions have played no great role in general relativity . ''",
    "using convex functions , we give geometric / topological proofs of geodesic connectedness for classes of space - times to which known methods do not apply .",
    "for instance : a null - disprisoning space - time is geodesically connected if it supports a proper , nonnegative strictly convex function whose critical set is a point .",
    "timelike strictly convex hypersurfaces of @xmath0 are geodesically connected .",
    "we also give a criterion for the existence of a convex function on a semi - riemannian manifold .",
    "sufficient conditions for geodesic connectedness of lorentzian manifolds are given by an early theorem of uhlenbeck ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3 ) , and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.25 ) . however , these theorems concern spaces with no conjugate points , whereas the spaces we consider may have conjugate points along geodesics of all causal types .",
    "geodesic connectedness was studied via an infinite - dimensional variational theory introduced by benci , fortunato , giannoni and masiello at the end of the 80 s .",
    "for lorentzian manifolds carrying a timelike killing field , geodesic connectedness has only recently become well understood @xcite .",
    "it is also known to hold for globally hyperbolic space - times carrying time - dependent orthogonal splittings satisfying certain conditions , as summarized in theorem [ thm : cs - main ] below .",
    "see the informative survey of geodesics in semi - riemannian manifolds by candela and sanchez @xcite , also see .",
    "globally hyperbolic manifolds always have orthogonal splittings @xcite , but there may be none satisfying the conditions just mentioned , e.g. de sitter space , which is not geodesically connected",
    ". or there might exist splittings that satisfy the conditions , but no known way to determine their existence .    according to @xcite : `` it should be interesting to obtain a result similar to that one also under weaker assumptions on the metric or under intrinsic hypotheses more related to the geometry of the manifold . ''",
    "uhlenbeck considers orthogonal splittings satisfying a metric growth condition , and also calls for a more geometric approach , observing that the growth condition is `` not very satisfactory since it depends on the splitting [ which ] may be changed in drastically different ways ... it is to be hoped that a similar condition that does not depend on coordinates may be found '' @xcite .",
    "our theorems concern strongly causal or , more generally , null - disprisoning space - times ; or else timelike convex hypersurfaces , which while globally hyperbolic , typically do not have natural orthogonal splitting that satisfies all the conditions in @xcite ( see appendix [ app : conclusion ] ) , nor do we know how to determine if any splitting that satisfies the conditions exists .",
    "our results raise important questions concerning lorentzian manifolds that satisfy the condition @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "this condition , introduced and applied by andersson and howard @xcite , extends @xmath3 from the riemannian to the semi - riemannian setting by requiring spacelike sectional curvatures to be @xmath4 and timelike ones to be @xmath5 ( for @xmath2 , reverse the inequalities ) .",
    "the geometric meaning of the condition , i.e. an equivalent local triangle comparison condition , was found in @xcite .",
    "( note that @xmath6 does not imply @xmath7 . )    recall that under the assumption of timelike sectional curvatures @xmath8 , harris proved a global _ timelike _ triangle comparison theorem @xcite .",
    "beem , ehrlich , markvorsen and galloway proved that the bartnik conjecture holds in this case @xcite .",
    "convex hypersurfaces of @xmath9 are riemannian manifolds of sectional curvature @xmath10 , and their properties reflect those of general riemannian manifolds of @xmath10 .",
    "timelike convex hypersurfaces of @xmath0 satisfy @xmath11 .",
    "thus our motivation for studying them is two - fold : they are space - times to which topological / geometric arguments readily apply , and in particular they carry convex functions . and",
    "as in the riemannian case , they should be a guide to properties of more general space - times of @xmath12 ( for some properties of @xmath12 , see remark [ rem : r > k ] below ) .",
    "we take @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as standard references on lorentzian and semi - riemannian geometry .    by a _",

    "equivalently , @xmath13 is convex ( strictly convex ) if and only if the hessian @xmath14 is positive semidefinite ( positive definite ) .    this paper demonstrates the importance of these classically convex functions ( equivalently , taking the negative , concave functions ) in studying the curvature condition @xmath12 on space - times . on riemannian spaces with sectional curvature @xmath15 ,",
    "such functions arise naturally ( cheeger - gromoll@xcite , see @xcite ) .    in @xcite , gibbons and ishibashi also introduce and consider  space - time convex \" functions on lorentzian manifolds , namely those satisfying @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the lorentzian metric , and @xmath14 has lorentzian signature .",
    "they discuss consequences of the existence of such functions , for instance , ruling out closed marginally inner and outer trapped surfaces .",
    "they give examples of space - time convex functions on cosmological space - times , anti - de - sitter space and black - hole space - times , and consider level sets of convex functions , as well as foliations by constant mean curvature hypersurfaces .",
    "on riemannian spaces with sectional curvature @xmath8 , convex functions again arise naturally ( bishop - oneill@xcite , see examples in ( * ? ? ? * ch.4 ) ) . in future work",

    ", gordon proved that if a connected riemannian manifold @xmath20 supports a proper , nonnegative convex function , then @xmath20 is geodesically connected @xcite .",
    "gordon s proof depends on the fact that complete riemannian manifolds are geodesically connected , and does not extend to the lorentz setting where geodesic connectedness is not a consequence of any completeness hypothesis .",
    "we prove the following semi - riemannian version of gordon s theorem .",
    "a semi - riemannian manifold @xmath20 is called _ disprisoning _ if for every inextendible geodesic @xmath21 , neither end lies in a compact set .",
    "@xmath20 is called _ null - disprisoning _ if for every inextendible null geodesic , neither end lies in a compact set .    note that strongly causal , in particular globally hyperbolic , space - times are null - disprisoning ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "if there is no non - constant complete geodesic on which @xmath13 is constant ( for example , if @xmath13 is strictly convex ) , then @xmath20 is geodesically connected .",
    "[ rem : r > k ] in riemannian comparison theory , the existence of proper nonnegative convex functions plays a fundamental role .",
    "a complete riemannian manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature always carries such a function , obtained by taking the negative of the infimum of all busemann functions of rays based at a point .",
    "the soul theorem of meyer - cheeger - gromoll is a consequence ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall see that the timelike convex hypersurfaces of @xmath0 in theorem [ thm : main ] , which as noted in the introduction satisfy @xmath11 ( namely , timelike sectional curvatures @xmath8 and spacelike ones @xmath15 ) , support proper convex functions ( theorem [ thm : support - convex ] ) .",
    "an important question in lorentzian geometry must be : what analogues of global riemannian comparison theory appear in lorentzian manifolds of @xmath11 , or @xmath23 or @xmath24 ?",
    "for instance , in @xcite , andersson and howard proved `` gap '' rigidity theorems for @xmath11 and @xmath25 of the type first proved for riemannian manifolds of @xmath10 and @xmath26 by greene and wu @xcite and gromov @xcite respectively .",

    "the analogous theorem is shown to hold in semi - riemannian manifolds of @xmath23 for _ signed _ alexandrov comparisons .",

    "a _ convex hypersurface _ of @xmath30 is a smooth manifold , smoothly embedded as the boundary of a convex body .",
    "we prove the following geodesic connectedness theorem for timelike convex hypersurfaces of minkowski space @xmath0 .",
    "note that since a convex hypersurface @xmath20 of @xmath0 splits off a non - null line if it contains one , geodesic connectedness of @xmath20 reduces to the case where @xmath20 contains no non - null line .",
