    "thus , the af spin fluctuations in a doped cuo@xmath9 plane are widely believed to have a fundamental connection with the underlying mechanism of high-@xmath8 superconductivity.@xcite extensive neutron scattering measurements have revealed an intimate relationship between the incommensurate ( ic ) low - energy spin fluctuations observed in la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath2 ( lsco)@xcite and the superconductivity.@xcite on the other hand , the discovery of evidence for cooperative spin and charge order in la@xmath12nd@xmath13sr@xmath14cuo@xmath15 ( lnsco ) provides a new perspective on the charge distribution within the cuo@xmath9 planes  @xcite ; doped charge spatially segregates into stripes that separate antiphase af domains .",
    "such self - organized states of the strongly correlated electrons result in a variety of interesting phenomena , and have attracted much attention due to their potential role in the mechanism of high-@xmath8 superconductivity .",
    "the physics behind the ic spin fluctuations in lsco remains controversial . to us ,",
    "the concept of fluctuating stripes@xcite provides an appealing explanation of the magnetic fluctuations ; however , there is an alternative school of thought that argues for an explanation in terms of fermi - surface - nesting effects.@xcite this controversy is tied to the issue of whether charge - stripe order is incompatible with superconductivity .",
    "it is clear experimentally that static ordering of charge stripes is correlated with a depression of @xmath8,@xcite but are the excitations of the stripe - ordered state different in nature from those in a state without static stripe order ?    to address these issues , we present a neutron scattering study of la@xmath10ba@xmath14cuo@xmath2 ( lbco ) with @xmath16 .",
    "this is the material in which high - temperature superconductivity was first discovered@xcite and in which the anomalous suppression of @xmath8 at @xmath16 was first observed.@xcite the difference between the ba- and sr - doped systems is associated with a subtle transition from the usual low - temperature - orthorhombic ( lto ) structure of lsco to the low - temperature - tetragonal ( ltt ) phase in the ba - doped material.@xcite the connection between the structural transition and the appearance of charge and spin stripe order has been clearly demonstrated in the @xmath17-doped la@xmath0ba@xmath18sr@xmath14cuo@xmath15 ( lbsco ) system@xcite ; however , up until now , the occurrence of stripe order in pure lbco has not been confirmed due to the difficulty of growing a crystal at the @xmath16 composition.@xcite    we begin our paper by presenting neutron diffraction evidence for stripe order within the ltt phase of la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , obtained using a large single crystal grown at kyoto university .",
    "on cooling , the transition to the ltt phase begins at @xmath19  k , and the magnetic and charge - order superlattice peaks appear essentially simultaneously at @xmath20  k. we then turn to the central topic , which is an investigation of the spin fluctuations for excitation energies in the range @xmath21  mev . we show that these low - energy excitations , which have some characteristics of spin waves within the stripe - ordered phase,@xcite evolve continuously through the ltt - to - lto transition . for @xmath4  mev , there is relatively little change in the imaginary part of the dynamic spin susceptibility , @xmath22 , through the transition , while at lower energies the * q*-integrated @xmath23 changes from being independent of @xmath24 in the ordered state to decreasing linearly towards zero as @xmath25 , as it must in the disordered state .",
    "these changes are similar to those observed for spin waves in undoped la@xmath9cuo@xmath15 as one warms through the nel temperature.@xcite in the latter case , the dynamical spin correlations in the paramagnetic state are viewed as evidence of instantaneous spin correlations with the character of the nel state but without the static order.@xcite by analogy , we take the low - energy ic spin fluctuations in the lto phase of lbco to be evidence of instantaneous stripe correlations of the same type that become ordered in the ltt phase.@xcite given that the nuclear displacements induced by charge order represent a primary order parameter for the stripe - ordered state,@xcite we conclude that ic spin fluctuations in the lto phase are evidence of dynamic charge stripes.@xcite the relevance to other cuprates will be discussed .",
    "a surprising feature observed in the ordered state is a dispersion of the inelastic ic scattering towards the af wave vector with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "this is different from the behavior that is observed for spin waves in stripe - ordered la@xmath10sr@xmath14nio@xmath26.@xcite this mystery has been resolved in a separate study,@xcite where we measured the spin excitations up to @xmath27  mev and found that their dispersion is incompatible with semiclassical spin - wave theory.@xcite instead , it appears that the full spectrum can be understood in terms of a model of weakly coupled 2-leg af spin ladders.@xcite    besides dispersing with energy , the apparent incommensurability @xmath28 is temperature dependent .",

    "( a similar result has been observed recently in lnsco.@xcite ) complementary reciprocal - space maps of the magnetic scattering at @xmath7 mev have been obtained at several temperatures for a sample of la@xmath0ba@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath2 .",
    "we show that the latter results can be reproduced by a disordered - stripe model , with a temperature - dependent average stripe period .",

    "the crystal growth was performed using an infrared radiation furnace ( nec machinery co. , sc - n35hd ) equipped with two large focusing mirrors and small halogen lamps .",
    "this combination of mirrors and lamps yields a sharp temperature gradient around the molten zone , which helps to provide stable conditions during the growth.@xcite both the feed and seed rods were rotating ( 20/25 rpm and counter to one another ) to ensure efficient mixing of the liquid and a homogeneous temperature distribution in the molten zone .",

    "the initial part of the grown rods ( @xmath3460 mm for lbco and @xmath3430 mm for lbsco ) , however , broke into powder , possibly due to the inclusion of an impurity phase such as la@xmath9o@xmath30 and/or ( la , ba)@xmath9cu@xmath9o@xmath36 . the samples for magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements were cut from the final part of the grown rod .",
    "crystals were subsequently annealed to minimize oxygen deficiencies in the same manner used for lsco.@xcite    = 2.75 in    figure 1 shows the magnetic susceptibilities measured using a squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) magnetometer . in the lbco sample , the field - shielding effect at low temperature is smaller , and the @xmath8 of 4 k is lower , compared with those reported for la@xmath37ba@xmath38cuo@xmath15 .",

    "for that system , the hall coefficient behaved `` normally '' ( i.e. , looked similar to comparably doped lsco ) in the lto phase , but dropped rapidly towards zero on cooling through the transition to the ltt phase for @xmath106 .",
    "the behavior in the ltt phase has been explained in terms of the response of charge stripes with a doped - hole concentration of 0.5 per cu site .",
    "for such a condition , there is electron - hole symmetry within a stripe , and consequently the hall coefficient should be zero.@xcite the electron - hole symmetry is quite sensitive to the hole concentration in the stripes , and hence it should be sensitive to the incommensurability , which will affect the hole concentration .",
