    "sample path properties of stochastic processes have been deeply studied for a long time , starting with the works of kolmogorov , lvy and others on the modulus of continuity and laws of the iterated logarithm of the brownian motion . since the late 1960s , these results were extended to general gaussian processes , while a finer study of the local properties of these sample paths was carried out ( we refer to berman @xcite , dudley @xcite , orey and pruit @xcite , orey and taylor @xcite and strassen @xcite , for the early study of gaussian paths and their rare events ) . among the large literature dealing with fine analysis of regularity ,",
    "hlder exponents continue to be widely used as a local measure of oscillations ( see @xcite for examples of recent works in this area ) .",
    "two different definitions , called local and pointwise hlder exponents , are usually considered for a stochastic process @xmath1 , depending whether the increment @xmath2 is compared with a power @xmath3 or @xmath4 inside a ball @xmath5 when @xmath6 . as an example , with probability one , the local regularity of fractional brownian motion @xmath7 is constant along the path : the pointwise and local hlder exponents at any @xmath8 are equal to the self - similarity index @xmath9 ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "this field of research is also very active in the multiparameter context and a non - exhaustive list of authors and recent works in this area includes ayache @xcite , dalang @xcite , khoshnevisan @xcite , lvy - vhel @xcite , xiao @xcite . as an extension to the multiparameter one",
    ", the set - indexed context appeared to be the natural framework to describe invariance principles studying convergence of empirical processes ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the understanding of set - indexed processes and particularly their regularity is a more complex issue than on points of @xmath10 .",

    "^ 2 $ ] such that @xmath13\\subseteq a$ ] for all @xmath14 ) is discontinuous with probability one ( we refer to @xcite or @xcite for the detailed proof ) . as a matter of fact , necessary and sufficient conditions for the sample path continuity property were investigated , starting with dudley @xcite who introduced a sufficient condition on the metric entropy of the indexing set , followed by fernique @xcite who gave a necessary conditions in the specific case of stationary processes on @xmath10 .",

    "we consider a supplementary assumption ( @xmath20 ) on @xmath21 and @xmath17 which impose that : 1 ) the distance from any @xmath22 to @xmath19 can be related to the cardinal @xmath23 , roughly by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is called the _ discretization exponent _ of @xmath26 ; and 2 ) a minimality condition on the class @xmath27 that is verified in most cases .",
