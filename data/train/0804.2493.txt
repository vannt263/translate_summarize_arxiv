    "[ sec : intro ]      alexandrov spaces are geodesic metric spaces with curvature bounds in the sense of local triangle comparisons .",
    "specifically , let @xmath5 denote the simply connected 2-dimensional riemannian space form of constant curvature @xmath4 . for curvature bounded below ( cbb ) by @xmath4",
    ", the distance between any two points of a geodesic triangle is required to be @xmath6 the distance between the corresponding points on the `` model '' triangle with the same sidelengths in @xmath5",
    ". for curvature bounded above ( cba ) , substitute `` @xmath7 '' .",
    "examples of alexandrov spaces include riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "a crucial property of alexandrov spaces is their preservation by gromov - hausdorff convergence ( assuming uniform injectivity radius bounds in the cba case ) .",
    "moreover , cbb spaces are topologically stable in the limit @xcite , a fact at the root of landmark riemannian finiteness and recognition theorems .",
    "( see grove s essay @xcite . )",
    "cba spaces are also important in geometric group theory ( see @xcite ) and harmonic map theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in lorentzian geometry ,",
    "_ timelike _ comparison and rigidity theory is well developed .",
    "early advances in timelike comparison geometry were made by flaherty @xcite , beem and ehrlich @xcite , and harris @xcite .",
    "in particular , a purely timelike , global triangle comparison theorem was proved by harris @xcite .",
    "a major advance in rigidity theory was the lorentzian splitting theorem , to which a number of researchers contributed ; see the survey in @xcite , and also the subsequent warped product splitting theorem in @xcite .",
    "the comparison theorems mentioned assume a bound on sectional curvatures @xmath8 of timelike 2-planes @xmath9 .",
    "note that a bound over _ all _ nonsingular 2-planes forces the sectional curvature to be constant @xcite , and so such bounds are uninteresting .",
    "this project began with the realization that certain lorentzian warped products , which may be called minkowski , de sitter or anti - de sitter cones , possess a global triangle comparison property that is not just timelike , but is fully analogous to the alexandrov one .",
    "the comparisons we mean are on signed lengths of geodesics , where the timelike sign is taken to be negative . in this paper , _",
    "length _ of either geodesics or vectors is always signed , and we will not talk about the length of nongeodesic curves .",
    "the _ model spaces _ are @xmath5 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the simply connected @xmath12-dimensional lorentz space form of constant curvature @xmath4 , and @xmath11 is @xmath5 with the sign of the metric switched , a space of constant curvature @xmath13 .",
    "the cones mentioned above turn out to have sectional curvature bounds of the following type . for any semi - riemannian manifold , call a tangent section _ spacelike _ if the metric is definite there , and _",
    "timelike _ if it is nondegenerate and indefinite .",
    "write _ @xmath0 _ if spacelike sectional curvatures are @xmath2 and timelike ones are @xmath3 ; for @xmath1 , reverse `` timelike '' and `` spacelike ''",
    ". equivalently , @xmath0 if the curvature tensor satisfies @xmath14 and similarly with inequalities reversed .",
    "the meaning of this type of curvature bound is clarified by noting that if one has merely a bound above on timelike sectional curvatures , or merely a bound below on spacelike ones , then the restriction @xmath15 of the sectional curvature function to any nondegenerate @xmath16-plane @xmath17 has a curvature bound below in our sense : @xmath18 ( as follows from @xcite ; see  [ sec : algebra ] below ) .",
    "then @xmath0 means that @xmath19 may be chosen independently of @xmath17 .",
    "spaces satisfying @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) are abundant , as warped product constructions show .",
    "they include , for example , the big bang cosmological models discussed by hawking and ellis @xcite ( see  [ sec : examples ] below ) .",
    "since there are many warped product examples satisfying @xmath0 for all @xmath4 in a nontrivial finite interval , then by stability , there are many non - warped product examples .    searching the literature for this type of curvature bound , we found it had been studied earlier by andersson and howard @xcite .",
    "their paper contains a riccati equation analysis and gap rigidity theorems .",
    "for example : a geodesically complete semi - riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath20 and index @xmath21 , having either @xmath22 or @xmath23 and an end with finite fundamental group on which @xmath24 , is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "their method uses parallel hypersurfaces , and does not concern triangle comparisons or the methods of alexandrov geometry .",
    "subsequently , daz - ramos , garca - ro , and hervella obtained a volume comparison theorem for `` celestial spheres '' ( exponential images of spheres in spacelike hyperplanes ) in a lorentz manifold with @xmath26 or @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "does this type of curvature bound always imply local triangle comparisons , or do triangle comparisons only arise in special cones ? in this paper",
    "we prove that curvature bounds @xmath0 or @xmath1 are actually equivalent to local triangle comparisons .",
    "the existence of model triangles is described in the realizability lemma of  [ sec : modellem ] .",
    "it states that any point in @xmath28 represents the sidelengths of a unique triangle in a model space of curvature @xmath29 , and the same holds for @xmath30 under appropriate _",
    "size bounds for @xmath4_.    we say @xmath31 is a _ normal neighborhood _ if it is a normal coordinate neighborhood ( the diffeomeorphic exponential image of some open domain in the tangent space ) of each of its points .",
    "there is a corresponding distinguished geodesic between any two points of @xmath31 , and the following theorem refers to these geodesics and the triangles they form . if in addition the triangles satisfy size bounds for @xmath4 , we say @xmath31 is _ normal for @xmath4_. all geodesics are assumed parametrized by @xmath32 $ ] , and by _ corresponding _",
    "points on two geodesics , we mean points having the same affine parameter .",
    "[ thm : comparison]if a semi - riemannian manifold satisfies @xmath33 , and @xmath31 is a normal neighborhood for @xmath4 , then the signed length of the geodesic between two points on any geodesic triangle of @xmath31 is at least ( at most ) that for the corresponding points on the model triangle in @xmath5 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "conversely , if triangle comparisons hold in some normal neighborhood of each point of a semi - riemannian manifold , then @xmath33 .    in this paper , we restrict our attention to local triangle comparisons ( i.e. , to normal neighborhoods ) in smooth spaces . in the riemannian / alexandrov theory ,",
    "local triangle comparisons have features of potential interest to semi - riemannian and lorentz geometers : they incorporate singularities , imply global comparison theorems , and are consistent with a theory of limit spaces . our longer - term goal is to see what the extension of the theory presented here can contribute to similar questions in semi - riemannian and lorentz geometry .",
    "we begin by mentioning some intuitive barriers to approaching theorem [ thm : comparison ] . in resolving them",
    ", we are going to draw on papers by karcher @xcite and andersson and howard @xcite , putting them to different uses than were originally envisioned .",
    "first , a fundamental object in riemannian theory is the locally isometrically embedded interval , that is , the unitspeed geodesic .",
    "these are the paths studied in @xcite and @xcite . however , in the semi - riemannian case this choice constrains consideration to fields of geodesics all having the same causal character .",
    "by contrast , our construction , which uses affine parameters on @xmath32 $ ] , applies uniformly to all the geodesics radiating from a point ( or orthogonally from a nondegenerate submanifold ) .",
    "secondly , a common paradigm in riemannian and alexandrov comparison theory is the construction of a curve that is shorter than some original one , so that the minimizing geodesic between the endpoints is even shorter . in the lorentz setting , this argument still works for _ timelike _ curves , under a causality assumption .",
    "however , spacelike geodesics are unstable critical points of the length functional , and so this argument is forbidden .",
    "thirdly , while the comparisons we seek can be reduced in the riemannian setting to @xmath34-dimensional riccati equations ( as in @xcite ) , the semi - riemannian case seem to require matrix riccati equations ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "such increased complexity is to be expected , since semi - riemannian curvature bounds below ( say ) have some of the qualities of riemannian curvature bounds both below _ and _ above .",
    "let us start by outlining karcher s approach to riemannian curvature bounds .",
    "it included a new proof of local triangle comparisons , one that integrated infinitesimal rauch comparisons to get distance comparisons without using the `` forbidden argument '' mentioned above .",
    "such an approach , motivated by simplicity rather than necessity in the riemannian case , is what the semi - riemannian case requires .    in this approach ,",
    "alexandrov curvature bounds are characterized by a differential inequality .",
    "namely , @xmath35 has cbb by @xmath4 in the triangle comparison sense if and only if for every @xmath36 and unit - speed geodesic @xmath37 , the differential inequality @xmath38 is satisfied ( in the barrier sense ) by the following function @xmath39 : @xmath40    the reason for this equivalence is that the inequalities ( [ eq : cb ] ) reduce to equations in the model spaces @xmath5 ; since solutions of the differential inequalities may be compared to those of the equations , distances in @xmath35 may be compared to those in @xmath5 .",
    "the functions @xmath41 then provide a convenient connection between triangle comparisons and curvature bounds , since they lead via their hessians to a riccati equation along radial geodesics from @xmath42 .",
    "we wish to view this program as a special case of a procedure on semi - riemannian manifolds . for a geodesic",
    "@xmath37 parametrized by @xmath32 $ ] , let @xmath43 thus @xmath44 in this paper , we work with normal neighborhoods , and set @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the geodesic from @xmath47 to @xmath42 that is distinguished by the normal neighborhood .",
    "( in a broader setting , one may instead use the definition @xmath48 under hypotheses that ensure the two definitions agree locally . in ( [ eq : edef2 ] ) , @xmath49 if @xmath47 and @xmath42 are not connected by a geodesic . )",
    "now define the _",
    "modified distance function @xmath50 at @xmath42 _ by @xmath51 here , the formula remains valid when the argument of cosine is imaginary , converting @xmath52 to @xmath53 . in the riemannian case , @xmath54 .",
    "the cbb triangle comparisons we seek will be characterized by the differential inequality @xmath55 on any geodesic @xmath37 parametrized by @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the self - adjoint operator @xmath56 associated with the hessian of @xmath57 may be regarded as a _ modified shape operator_. it has the following properties : in the model spaces , it is a scalar multiple of the identity on the tangent space to @xmath35 at each point ; along a nonnull geodesic from @xmath42 , its restriction to normal vectors is a scalar multiple of the second fundamental form of the equidistant hypersurfaces from @xmath42 ; it is smoothly defined on the regular set of @xmath58 , hence along null geodesics from @xmath42 ( as the second fundamental forms are not ) ; and finally , it satisfies a matrix riccati equation along every geodesic from @xmath42 , after reparametrization as an integral curve of @xmath59 .",
    "we shall also need semi - riemannian analogues to the three basic triangle lemmas on which alexandrov geometry builds , namely , the realizability , hinge and straightening lemmas .",
    "the analogues are intuitively surprising , both in one of the quantities considered , and also in the fact that monotonicity statements persist even though the model space may change . the straightening lemma is an indicator that , as in the standard riemannian / alexandrov case , there is a singular counterpart to the smooth theory developed in this paper .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : modellem ] with the triangle lemmas just mentioned . in  [ sec : mode ] , it is shown that the differential inequalities ( [ eq : diffineq ] ) become equations in the model spaces , and hence characterize our triangle comparisons .",
    "comparisons for the modified shape operators under semi - riemannian curvature bounds are proved in  [ sec : comparericcati ] , and theorem [ thm : comparison ] is proved in  [ sec : comparison ] .    in  [",
    "sec : algebra ] , semi - riemannian curvature bounds are related to the analysis by beem and parker of the pointwise ranges of sectional curvature @xcite , and to the `` null '' curvature bounds considered by uhlenbeck @xcite and harris @xcite .    finally ,  [ sec : examples ] considers examples of semi - riemannian spaces with curvature bounds , including robertson - walker `` big bang '' spacetimes .",
    "say three numbers _ satisfy the strict triangle inequality _ if they are positive and the largest is less than the sum of the other two .",

    "if the smallest coordinate is @xmath76 , the point is realized by a unique triangle in @xmath10 .",
    "part 1 is standard , as is part 2 for @xmath77 .",
    "now consider a point not in @xmath78 , and denote its coordinates by @xmath79 .",
    "to realize this point in @xmath73 , suppose @xmath80 and take a segment @xmath37 of length @xmath81 on the @xmath82-axis .",
    "since distance `` circles '' about a point @xmath47 are pairs of lines of slope @xmath83 through @xmath47 if the radius is @xmath29 , and hyperbolas asymptotic to these lines otherwise , it is easy to see that circles about the endpoints of @xmath37 intersect , either in two points or tangentially , subject only to the condition that @xmath84 if @xmath85 , namely , the point is not in @xmath65 .",

    "since @xmath97 , switching the sign of the metric completes the proof .",
    "let us say the points of @xmath28 for which lemma [ lem : realiz ] gives model space realizations _ satisfy size bounds for @xmath4 _",
    "( for @xmath98 , no size bounds apply ) .",
    "such a point may be expressed as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a realizing triangle in a model space of curvature @xmath4 , the geodesic @xmath46 is a side parametrized by @xmath32 $ ] with @xmath101 , and we write @xmath102 . by the _",
    "nonnormalized angle @xmath103 _ , we mean the inner product @xmath104 .    in our terminology , @xmath103 is the _ included _ , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the _ shoulder _ , nonnormalized angles for @xmath99 .",
    "this terminology is welldefined since the realizing model space and triangle are uniquely determined except for degenerate triples .",
    "the latter have only two realizations , which lie in geodesic segments in different model spaces but are isometric to each other .",
    "an important ingredient of the alexandrov theory is the hinge lemma for angles in @xmath5 , a monotonicity statement that follows directly from the law of cosines .",
    "part 1 of the following lemma is its semi - riemannian version .",
    "a new ingredient of our arguments is the use of nonnormalized shoulder angles , in which both the `` angle '' and one side vary simultaneously .",
    "not only do we obtain a monotonicity statement that for @xmath30 is not directly apparent from the law of cosines ( part 2 of the following lemma ) , but we find that monotonicity persists even as the model space changes .",
    "[ lem : hinge ] suppose a point of @xmath28 satisfies size bounds for @xmath4 , and the third coordinate varies with the first two fixed .",
    "denote the point by @xmath99 where @xmath100 lies in a possibly varying model space of curvature @xmath4 .    _ .",
    "_    the included nonnormalized angle @xmath103 is a decreasing function of @xmath107 .",
    "each shoulder nonnormalized angle , @xmath105 or @xmath106 , is an increasing function of @xmath107 .",
    "suppose @xmath98 .",
    "then the model spaces are semi - euclidean planes , and the sides of a triangle may be represented by vectors @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . set @xmath111 and @xmath112 , so @xmath113 since @xmath95 is an increasing function of its sidelength , part @xmath34 in any fixed model space is immediate by taking @xmath114 and @xmath115 in ( [ eq : ip1 ] ) to be fixed . for part @xmath12 in any fixed model space , it is only necessary to rewrite ( [ eq : ip1 ] ) as @xmath116 where @xmath114 and @xmath95 are fixed .",
    "a change of model space occurs when the varying point in @xmath28 moves upward on a vertical line @xmath117 , and passes either into or out of @xmath65 by crossing @xmath63 ( the same argument will hold for @xmath62 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "see figure [ fig : hinge ] .",
    "thus @xmath117 is the union of three closed segments , intersecting only at their two endpoints on @xmath63 .",
    "we have just seen that the included angle function is decreasing on each segment , since the realizing triangles are in the same model space ( by choice at the endpoints and by necessity elsewhere ) .",
    "since the values at the endpoints are the same from left or right , the included angle function is decreasing on all of @xmath117 .",
    "similarly , each shoulder angle function is increasing .",
    "suppose @xmath74 .",
    "the vertices of a triangle in the quadric model space are also the vertices of a triangle in an ambient @xmath12-plane , whose sides are the chords of the original sides .",
    "the length of the chord is an increasing function of the original sidelength .",
    "thus to derive the lemma for @xmath74 from ( [ eq : ip1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ip2 ] ) , we must verify the following : if a triangle in a quadric model space varies with fixed sidelengths adjacent to one vertex , and @xmath118 are the tangent vectors to the sides at that vertex , then @xmath119 is an increasing function of @xmath120 where the @xmath121 are the chordal vectors of the two sides .",
    "indeed , all points of a distance circle of nonzero radius in the quadric model space lie at a fixed nonzero ambient distance from the tangent plane at the centerpoint .",
    "thus @xmath121 is a linear combination of @xmath122 and a fixed normal vector @xmath123 to the tangent plane , where the coefficients depend only on the sidelength @xmath124 .",
    "the desired correlation follows .    by switching the sign of the metric",
    ", we obtain the claim for @xmath75 .",
    "the law of cosines in a semi - riemannian model space with @xmath98 is ( [ eq : ip1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath30 , the law of cosines for @xmath100 may be written in unified form as follows : @xmath125 here we assume @xmath100 satisfies the size bounds for @xmath4 .",
    "then each sidelength is @xmath70 if @xmath74 , and @xmath126 if @xmath75 .",
    "part 1 of lemma [ lem : hinge ] can be derived from ( [ eq : coslaw ] ) as follows .",
    "fix @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and observe that @xmath129 is decreasing in @xmath95 if @xmath74 , regardless of the sign of @xmath95 and even as @xmath95 passes through @xmath29 , and increasing in @xmath95 if @xmath75 .",
    "the size bounds imply that the factors @xmath130 become either @xmath130 for @xmath131 , or @xmath132 , depending on the signs of @xmath4 and @xmath81 , and hence are nonnegative .",
    "now we are ready to prove a semi - riemannian version of alexandrov s straightening lemma , according to which a triangle inherits comparison properties from two smaller triangles that subdivide it .",
    "it turns out that the comparisons we need are on nonnormalized shoulder angles .",
    "moreover , the original and `` subdividing '' triangles may lie in varying model spaces , so that geometrically we have come a long way from the original interpretation in terms of hinged rods .",
