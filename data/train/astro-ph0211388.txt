    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : e.g. , york et al .",
    "2000 ) has been finding high - redshift quasars at @xmath9 ; the most distant known to date is sdssp j103027.10 + 052455.0 at @xmath10 ( fan et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "one serious problem seems to be that all of these @xmath11 sdss quasars are exceptionally bright ( see table 1 ) . as claimed by wyithe and loeb ( 2002 ; hereafter wl02 ) , the presence of such very bright quasars at @xmath11 raises the following two problems : ( 1 ) if the central engine of these quasars is an accreting supermassive black hole and shines near the eddington accretion rate , a supermassive black hole with mass exceeding @xmath12 was already formed beyond @xmath13 .",
    "this challenges models for early structure formation ( turner 1991 ; haiman , loeb 2001 ) .",
    "also , ( 2 ) the absolute luminosities of the @xmath11 quasars are systematically higher than expected from the sdss survey criteria ( fan et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) , suggesting that the luminosity function of the @xmath11 quasars is significantly biased to higher luminosities .",
    "these two problems urge wl02 to propose that the sdss @xmath11 quasars may be magnified by intervening gravitational lenses .",
    "during the course of our optical deep survey program on l@xmath0 emitters at @xmath1 in the field surrounding the quasar sdssp j104433.04@xmath2012502.2 at @xmath3 , we found that a faint galaxy with @xmath4(ab ) @xmath5 is located at southwest of this quasar . in this paper",
    ", we report on the possibility that sdssp j104433.04@xmath2012502.2 is gravitationally magnified by a faint galaxy with optical photometric and spectroscopic data obtained by our observations . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a flat universe with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17100 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 ) .",
    "deep optical imaging observations were made with the suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "1998 ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope ( kaifu 1998 ) at mauna kea observatories .",
    "the suprime - cam consists of ten 2k@xmath194k ccd chips and provides a very wide field of view : @xmath20 with a /pixel resolution .",
    "therefore , the combination between the suprime - cam and the subaru telescope enables us to carry out wide and deep narrow - band imaging surveys for high-@xmath21 emission - line objects . using this facility , we made a very deep optical imaging survey for faint l@xmath0 emitters in the field surrounding the sdssp j104433.04@xmath2012502.2 at a redshift of 5.74 ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ; djorgovski et al . 2001",
    "; goodrich et al . 2001 ) . in this survey , we used a narrow - passband filter , nb816 , centered at 8160    with a passband of @xmath22(fwhm ) = 120  ; the central wavelength corresponds to a redshift of 5.72 for l@xmath0 emission .",
    "we also used broad - passband filters : @xmath6 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and z@xmath25 .",
    "a summary of the imaging observations is given in table 2 .",
    "all of the observations were made under photometric conditions , and the seeing size was between and during the run .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze only two ccd chips in which the quasar sdssp j104433.04@xmath2012502.2 is included ( see also ajiki et al .",
    "the field size is by .",
    "the individual ccd data were reduced and combined using iraf and mosaic - ccd data - reduction software developed by yagi et al .",
    "the photometric and spectrophotometric standard stars used in the flux calibration were sa101 for the @xmath6 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 data , and gd 50 , gd 108 ( oke 1990 ) , and pg 1034 + 001 ( massey et al .",
    "1996 ) for the nb816 data .",
    "the @xmath7 data were calibrated using the magnitude of sdssp j104433.04@xmath2012502.2 ( fan et al .",
    "thumb - nail optical images of the quasar filed are shown in figure 1 .",
    "a faint galaxy is seen at southwest from the quasar .",
    "this galaxy is seen even in the @xmath6-band image , giving a rough constraint such that its redshift is @xmath26 , since the wavelength of redshifted l@xmath0 absorptions by intergalactic neutral hydrogen is considered to be shorter than about 4400  .",
    "in order to estimate a spectroscopic redshift , we carried out optical spectroscopy using the subaru faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; kashikawa et al .",
    "2000 ) on 2002 march 13 ( ut ) .",
    "we used 300 lines mm@xmath18 grating blazed at 7500    ( 300r ) together with an order cut filter sy47 , giving a spectral resolution of @xmath27 with a -wide slit .",
    "this setting gave a wavelength coverage between 4700    and 9400  .",
    "the integration time was 1800 s. the spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this spectrum shows that this galaxy has blue colors , and that there is no prominent emission line .",
    "if this galaxy is a strong emission - line galaxy , like a starburst galaxy , it is inferred either that its redshifted wavelength of l@xmath0 emission line would be shorter than 4700  ,   or that its redshifted wavelength of [ o ii]@xmath283727 emission line would be longer than 9400  . from these constraints , one may estimate that the redshift of this galaxy lies in a range between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the faint galaxy which we have found ( hereafter , the lens galaxy ) is located at southwest from the quasar . in order to estimate how the quasar is gravitationally magnified ,",
    "we need information about both the redshift and the stellar velocity dispersion of this lens galaxy .",
    "however , no direct information on these two quantities was obtained in our observations .",
    "therefore , in this paper , first , we estimate its photometric redshift based on our optical broad - band photometric data ( subsection 4.1 ) .",
    "second , we also estimate its stellar velocity dispersion using the tully  fisher relation ( subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "then , we estimate the magnification factor based on the singular isothermal sphere model for gravitational lensing ( subsection 4.3 ) .      using optical @xmath6 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , nb816 , and @xmath7 data , we estimated a probable photometric redshift of the lens galaxy .",
    "its optical magnitudes obtained in our observations were @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ; the quoted errors are 1@xmath36 sky noises .",
    "it is noted again that because the lens galaxy is not a @xmath6-dropout , we had a constraint of @xmath37 .",
    "the sed of a galaxy that we observed was mainly determined by the following four factors : ( 1 ) the radiation from stars in the galaxy , ( 2 ) the extinction by dust in the galaxy , itself , ( 3 ) the redshift of the galaxy , and ( 4 ) the absorption by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen between the galaxy and us .",
    "we treated the above factors in the following way .",
    "we used the population synthesis model gissel96 , which is a revised version of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) ( see also leitherer et al .",
    "1996 ) , to calculate an sed from stellar components .",
    "the sed of the galaxy was determined by its star - formation history .",
    "the seds of local galaxies were well reproduced by models whose star - formation rate declines exponentially ( @xmath45 model ) ; i.e. , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath45 is the time scale of star formation .",
    "different combinations of @xmath47 and @xmath45 generate a similar shape of sed . in this work",
    ", we therefore used @xmath48 gyr models with the salpeter s initial mass function ( the power index of @xmath49 and the stellar mass range of @xmath50 ) to derive various sed types .",
    "we adopted the solar metallicity , @xmath51 .",
    "for these models , we calculated seds with ages of @xmath47 = 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 8 gyr , and called them sed1 , sed2 , sed3 , sed4 , sed5 , sed6 , and sed7 , respectively ; note that the sed templates derived by coleman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , elliptical galaxies ( the bulges of m 31 and m 81 ) , sbc , scd , and irr correspond to those of sed7 ( @xmath52 gyr ) , sed6 ( @xmath53 gyr ) , sed5 ( @xmath54 gyr ) , and sed4 ( @xmath55 gyr ) , respectively .",
    "we adopted the dust extinction curve for starburst galaxies determined by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with visual extinctions of @xmath56 = 0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1.0 . as for the absorption by intergalactic neutral hydrogen",
    ", we used the average optical depth derived by madau et al .",
    "however , scott , bechtold , and dobrzycki ( 2000 ) showed that the observed continuum depression between @xmath57    and @xmath58    due to the l@xmath0 clouds ( @xmath59 ) for quasars with @xmath60 3 is lower than that expected from extrapolation using the cosmic transmission derived by madau et al .",
    "further , they also showed that there is a scatter in @xmath59 from quasar to quasar .",
    "therefore , we also investigated the following two cases : 1 ) 0.5 @xmath19 the madau et al.s average optical depth , and 2 ) 2 @xmath19 the madau et al.s average optical depth .",
    "we then estimated the probable photometric redshift of the lens galaxy .",
    "in this procedure , we adopted an allowed redshift of between @xmath61 and @xmath13 with a redshift bin of @xmath62 = 0.02 .",
    "our results are shown in figure 3 . in this figure",
    ", we show the distributions of the likelihood for the seven seds .",
    "our best estimate of the photometric redshift of the lens galaxy is @xmath63 .",
    "since the likelihood , @xmath64 , exceeds 0.1 for @xmath65 1.5  2.5 , it is suggested that the lens galaxy is located at 1.5 @xmath66 2.5 .",
    "this range is consistent with the information from our optical spectroscopy ( section 3 ) .",
    "sed1 appears to be inappropriate for the sed of the lens galaxy .",
    "it is found that sed7 also has a maximum likelihood larger than 0.1 around @xmath67 .",
    "however , since the age of the galaxy at @xmath67 is considered to be younger than 2 gyr , we also threw out sed7 .",
    "the luminosity of the galaxy was evaluated to be the normalization factor , @xmath43 , times the luminosity of the model .",
    "the range of the evaluated absolute @xmath6-band magnitude for sed2 through sed6 was between @xmath68 and 2.5 is @xmath69 .",
    "although it is necessary for the estimate of the magnification factor by gravitational lensing to know the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath70 ) of the lens galaxy , there is no direct measurement .",
    "given the redshift of a lens galaxy , we could estimate its absolute magnitude and then estimate a probable value of the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "since it is considered that the lens galaxy is located at 1.5 @xmath66 2.5 , we could estimate the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of both the redshift and sed based on the tully  fisher relation established for a sample of galaxies in the local universe .        where @xmath72 is the absolute @xmath6 magnitude and @xmath73 is the full width at 20% of the maximum velocity .",
    "assuming that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the rotation velocity , we estimated @xmath70 as a function of @xmath21 and sed .",
    "we evaluated @xmath72 using the method given in subsection 4.1 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "since the cases of sed1 and sed7 are rejected in subsection 4.1 , the velocity dispersion is estimated to be in a range between 140 km s@xmath18 and 280 km s@xmath18 for a redshift range of 1.5 @xmath66 2.5 .",
    "we are now ready to estimate the magnification factor by gravitational lensing .",
    "we adopt the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model for simplicity ( e.g. , binney , merrifield 1998 ) . in this model , the magnification factor for the brighter source can be expressed as          where @xmath80 is the angular diameter distance between the lens galaxy and the source and @xmath81 is that between the observer and the source . in figure 5 , we show the magnification factor as a function of @xmath21 for eight cases of @xmath70 = 140 , 160 , 180 , 200 , 220 , 240 , 260 , and 280 km s@xmath18 . in this figure",
    ", we also show the magnification factor for the counter image [ @xmath82 , which can be seen at @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the angle between the lens galaxy and the intrinsic source .",
    "if the lens galaxy is located at @xmath85 and has @xmath86 km s@xmath18 , @xmath78 becomes and we thus obtain @xmath87 = infinity . however , if this is the case , since @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we would observe the counter image with nearly the same brightness as that of the lensed image .",
    "further , if @xmath90 , @xmath91 is also as large as @xmath87 . as we shown in figure 1 that there is no apparent object , except the quasar ( @xmath92 mag ) and the lens galaxy ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "since there is no apparent counter image , the magnification factor must be much less than 10 .",
    "if @xmath94 200 km s@xmath18 , the condition of @xmath95 is achieved at @xmath85 . in this case , we obtain @xmath96 .",
    "we have found a candidate of a lensing galaxy at southwest of the sdss high-@xmath21 quasar , sdssp j104433.04@xmath2012502.2 . from our observational data , we find that the lens galaxy is located at @xmath97 ; the most probable photometric redshift is @xmath63 . adopting the sis model for gravitational lensing , we estimate the magnification factor to be @xmath96 if the lens galaxy is located at @xmath85 and has a stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath98 km s@xmath18 .",
    "wl02 suggested that the sdss @xmath99 quasars are systematically brighter than expected .",
    "namely , they investigated the probability that a quasar with a rest - frame 1450    magnitude , @xmath100(ab ) , and a redshift of @xmath21 was selected into the survey using the survey selection function given in fan et al .",
    "they found that the cumulative probability of @xmath100(ab ) for the @xmath11 quasars is different from the expected one at the 95% significance level .",
    "however , they also suggested that this inconsistence is removed if the flux of one or more of the @xmath11 quasars is overestimated by a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , our finding presented in this paper may remove the inconsistency raised by wl02 .",
    "it is known that the lensing optical depth increases with increasing the redshift , and thus objects at higher redshift are more affected by gravitational lensing from a statistical point of view ( e.g. , turner 1991 ; barkana , loeb 2000 ; wl02 ) . as proposed by wl02",
    ", it will be very important to carefully search for lensing galaxies towards all high-@xmath21 quasars by deep and high - resolution imaging .",

    "we also thank dr .",
