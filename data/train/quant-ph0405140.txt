    "the description of the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with their surrounding is , in general , a very difficult task due to the complexity of the environment .",
    "an exact approach would require to take into account not only the degrees of freedom of the system of interest , but also those of the environment .",
    "one can , in principle , look for the solution of the liouville - von neumann equation for the density matrix of the total closed system . even when this is possible , however , the total density matrix contains much more information than what we actually need , since one is usually interested in the time evolution of the reduced system only .",
    "a common approach to the dynamics of open quantum systems consists in deriving a master equation for the reduced density matrix describing the temporal behavior of the open system @xcite .",
    "this equation is in general obtained by tracing over the environmental variables , after performing a series of approximations .",
    "two of the most common ones are the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and the born - markov approximation .",
    "the first one basically consists in neglecting in the microscopic system - reservoir interaction hamiltonian the counter - rotating terms responsible for the virtual exchanges of energy between system and environment .",
    "the second one neglects the correlations between system and reservoir assuming that the changes in the reservoir due to the interaction with the system can not feed back into the system s dynamics .",
    "the born - markov approximation leads to a master equation which can be cast in the so called lindblad form @xcite .",
    "master equations in the lindblad form are characterized by the fact that the dynamical group of the system satisfies both the semigroup property and the complete positivity condition , thus ensuring the preservation of positivity of the density matrix during the time evolution .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that numerical techniques as the monte carlo wave function method can always , in principle , be applied to the description of the dynamics , provided that the master equation is in the lindblad form @xcite .    in many solid state systems such as photonic band gap materials and quantum dots",
    "the markov approximation is , however , not justified @xcite .",
    "similarly , the reservoir interacting with a single mode cavity in atom lasers is strongly non - markovian @xcite .",
    "these physical systems therefore necessitate non - markovian analytical or numerical approaches to their dynamics . moreover , the non - markovian features become of importance when one is interested in the initial temporal regime , even for markovian systems , where the memory time of the reservoir @xmath0 is much smaller than the system characteristic time scale @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that during the last few years the interest in open quantum systems has increased mainly due to three reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the phenomena of decoherence and dissipation , characterizing the dynamics of a quantum system interacting with its surrounding @xcite , are considered nowadays the major obstacles to the realization of quantum computers and other quantum devices @xcite . on the other hand recent experiments on engineering of environments",
    "@xcite pave the way to new proposals aimed at creating entanglement and superpositions of quantum states exploiting decoherence and dissipation @xcite .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that presently the fields of quantum information and open quantum systems actually merge in the question to what extent the entangling power of the system - reservoir interaction is the responsible factor for decoherence @xcite . in order to understand deeply the origin , essence and effects of decoherence phenomena , it is of great importance to have the tools for an exact description of the open system dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we focus on an ubiquitous model of the theory of open quantum systems , that is the quantum brownian motion model , which is also known as the damped harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "we consider the exact generalized master equation obtained with the time - convolutionless projection operator technique @xcite .",
    "we exploit an analytic approach based on the algebraic properties of the superoperators appearing in the master equation @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the explicit expression of the exact analytic solution of this equation allows us to study in a complete way the dynamics and , in particular , the short time non - markovian regime .",
    "the analytic results are in very good agreement with the numerical simulations obtained by means of the non - markovian wave function ( nmwf ) method @xcite , a variant of the monte carlo ( mc ) methods @xcite . by looking at the dissipation and diffusion coefficients we single out those parameters governing the passage from lindblad to non - lindblad type regimes .",
    "the dynamics of the system in the lindblad type regime is governed by a lindblad type master equation , whereas in the non - lindblad type regime , the master equation can not be cast in the lindblad form and the dynamics is dominated by virtual exchanges of energy between the system and the environment .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] we recall the exact time - convolutionless master equation for quantum brownian motion and its superoperatorial solution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] we apply the non - markovian wave function method to the system under scrutiny . sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec : results2 ] contain the main results of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we study the border between lindblad and non - lindblad regions , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : results2 ] we focus on the non - lindblad type dynamics looking at the temporal evolution of the squeezing , of the mandel parameter and of the wigner function .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we first recall the microscopic model and the exact master equation for the reduced density matrix of a quantum brownian particle .",
    "then we briefly sketch an analytic approach to derive an exact solution for the master equation .",
    "let us consider a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath2 surrounded by a generic bosonic environment .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the total system can be written as follows @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the system , environment and interaction hamiltonians , respectively , and @xmath8 is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian considered here has a simple bilinear form with position of the oscillator @xmath9 and position environmental operator @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the position operators of the environmental oscillators . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we have written the previous expressions in terms of dimensionless position and momentum operators for the system oscillator .",
    "the key quantity governing the nature of the coupling is the spectral density @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 masses and frequencies of the environmental oscillators , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the density matrix of the total system . under the assumptions that : ( i ) at @xmath16 system and environment are uncorrelated , that is @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 density matrices of the system and the environment respectively ; ( ii ) the environment is stationary , that is @xmath20=0 $ ] ; ( iii ) the expectation value of the environmental operator @xmath21 is zero , that is @xmath22 ( as for example in the case of a thermal reservoir ) , one can derive the following master equation @xcite @xmath23\\rho_s(t ) . \\label{qbmme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we indicate with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the commutator ( anticommutator ) position and momentum superoperators respectively and with @xmath26 the commutator superoperator relative to the system hamiltonian .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that such a master equation , obtained by using the time - convolutionless projection operator technique @xcite , is the superoperatorial version of the hu - paz - zhang master equation @xcite .",
    "this equation can be solved in generality @xcite although the time dependent coefficients have no obvious closed form .",
    "for this reason , the exact study of the non - markovian behaviour of the system for strong couplings may be performed only by means of numerical methods .",
    "also in this case , however , one needs , firstly , to find out the parameter regime in which a perturbation expansion to a given order yields reliable numerical results .",
    "this is in general a very difficult task . in the following",
    "we will focus on the dynamics of the system in the weak coupling limit , and in particular we will consider the case in which a truncation of the expansion in the coupling strength @xmath8 to the second order is physically meaningful . under this condition the time dependent coefficients appearing in the master equation can be written as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 \\rangle , \\label{mu}\\ ] ] are the noise and dissipation kernels , respectively .",
    "for the case of an ohmic reservoir spectral density with lorentz - drude cutoff @xcite @xmath30 the noise and dissipation kernels assume the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cutoff frequency and @xmath33 denote the matsubara frequencies .",
    "it is worth noting that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to estimate in an easy way the order of magnitude of the error associated to the truncated expression of the coefficients .",
    "this allows to check the range of validity of the weak coupling approximation .",
    "the errors of the time dependent coefficients , up to the fourth order in the coupling constant , are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we will see in the following , truncating the perturbation expansion to the second order , it is possible to find a closed analytic form for two time dependent coefficients playing a special role in the dynamics : the diffusion coefficient @xmath34 and the dissipation coefficient @xmath35 . dealing with a closed analytic expression of these parameters allows to gain new insight in the dynamics of the open system .",
    "in fact , the possibility of studying analytically the border between lindblad and non - lindblad - type dynamics stems from the availability of a closed expression for these time dependent parameters .",
    "let us now look in more detail at the form of the master equation ( [ qbmme ] ) .",
    "first of all , we note that this master equation is local in time , even if non - markovian .",
    "this feature is typical of all the generalized master equations derived by using the time - convolutionless projection operator technique @xcite or equivalent approaches such as the superoperatorial one @xcite .    the time dependent coefficients appearing in ( [ qbmme ] ) contain all the information about the short time system - reservoir correlation .",
    "the coefficient @xmath36 gives rise to a time dependent renormalization of the frequency of the oscillator . in the weak coupling limit",
    "one can show that @xmath36 gives a negligible contribution as far as the reservoir cutoff frequency remains finite @xcite .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath35 is a classical damping term while the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath37 are diffusive terms .",
    "averaging over the rapidly oscillating terms appearing in the time dependent coefficients of eq.([qbmme ] ) one gets the following secular approximated master equation @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\ \\!\\ ! & - & \\!\\!\\!\\frac{\\delta(t ) - \\gamma ( t)}{2 } \\left [   a a^{\\dag } \\rho_s - 2 a^{\\dag } \\rho_s a + \\rho_s a a^{\\dag }   \\right]\\!\\ ! , \\label{merwa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the bosonic annihilation and creation operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ merwa ] ) is similar to the lindblad form , with the only difference that the coefficients appearing in the master equation are time dependent .",
    "we say that this master equation is of lindblad type when the coefficients @xmath41 are positive at all times @xcite .",
    "note , however , that lindblad type master equations , contrarily to master equations of lindblad form , in general do not satisfy the semigroup property .    in what follows we focus on the secular master equation given by eq .",
    "( [ merwa ] ) .",
    "let us stress that the secular approximation invoked here does not coincide with the rwa commonly used to describe quantum optical systems .",
    "indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , differences in what we may call the _ rwa performed before or after tracing over the environment _ do exist , and they are in principle measurable .",
    "the rwa performed before tracing over the environment consists in neglecting the counter  rotating terms in the microscopic hamiltonian describing the coupling between system and environment .",
    "the rwa performed after tracing over the environment is more precisely a secular approximation , consisting in an average over rapidly oscillating terms , but does not wash out the effect of the counter  rotating terms present in the coupling hamiltonian ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that there exists a class of observables not influenced by the secular approximation @xcite .",
    "the exact time evolution of the operators belonging to such a class can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ merwa ] ) .",
    "examples of such observables are the mean value of the quantum number operator @xmath42 , hereafter called the heating function , and the mandel parameter @xmath43 .",

    "a we give the expression for @xmath34 for generic @xmath46 and in appendix b its high @xmath46 and markovian approximations .",
    "the master equation ( [ qbmme ] ) can be exactly solved by using specific algebraic properties of the superoperators @xcite .",
    "the solution for the density matrix of the system is derived in terms of the quantum characteristic function ( qcf ) @xmath47 at time @xmath48 , defined through the relation @xcite @xmath49 it is worth noting that one of the advantages of this approach is the relatively easiness in calculating the analytic expressions for the mean values of observables of interest by means of the relations : @xmath50 in the secular approximation the qcf is found to be @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the qcf of the initial state of the system , and we defined @xmath53 the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) are defined in terms of the diffusion and dissipation coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively ( see eqs .",
    "( [ gammasecord ] ) and ( [ deltasecord ] ) ) as follows @xmath56 equation  ( [ chit ] ) shows that the qcf is the product of an exponential factor , depending on both the diffusion @xmath34 and the dissipation @xmath35 coefficients , and a transformed initial qcf .",
    "the exponential term is responsible of energy dissipation and it is independent of the initial state of the system .",
    "information on the initial state is given by the second term of the product , the transformed initial qcf .",
    "in the weak coupling limit considered here the asymptotic values of the diffusion and dissipation coefficients coincide with the markovian ones ( see appendix b ) . in this case",

    "in general , however , for strongly coupled systems , the steady state could be very different from the thermal state .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see pp .",
    "481 - 483 ) it is shown that , already for @xmath58 the steady state solution in the low temperature regime shows squeezing in position .",
    "in this section we describe how to implement the non - markovian wave function ( nmwf ) method for the study of quantum brownian motion by using the stochastic unravelling of the master equation in the doubled hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "we use monte carlo ( mc ) methods both to confirm the validity of the involved analytical solution and to demonstrate that these methods can be used to study the heating dynamics of a quantum brownian particle in very general conditions .",
    "one might think that it is straightforward to apply mc methods , e.g. the nmwf method , once the master equation of the system and the corresponding jump operators are known .",
    "however , there exist situations in which the mc simulations become exceedingly heavy from the computer resource point of view  @xcite . in the following we show that , in our case , mc methods can be used conveniently to study numerically the system dynamics also in the non - lindblad regime where the time dependent decay coefficients @xmath59 may acquire temporarily negative values .",

    "thus , also in the presence of an oscillatory behavior of @xmath34 , that is when @xmath143 , for low temperatures the diffusion coefficient remains always positive . in this case , however , dissipation is not negligible with respect to diffusion anymore and their combined action is such that , for intermediate and low temperatures , the non ",
    "lindblad dynamics appears already for @xmath155 [ see fig.[results2 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "stated in another way , decreasing the temperature the oscillatory behavior of the heating function appears for higher values of the ratio @xmath136 , which means that the non - lindblad region becomes larger .",
    "[ results2 ] shows clearly that this region , corresponding to negative values of @xmath156 ( @xmath34 for high @xmath46 ) , is notably wider for low @xmath46 ( b ) than for high @xmath46 ( a ) .",
    "while in this section we have investigated the border between the lindblad and non - lindblad type regions , in the following section we will concentrate on the non - lindblad type dynamics for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that , in general , due to difficulties in dealing with non - lindblad type master equations , only few studies have been carried out in this regime .",
    "secondly , we have shown elsewhere that typical non - lindblad dynamical features may be experimentally revealed in the trapped ion context with currently available technology @xcite .",
    "in this section we focus on the dynamics of a quantum brownian particle in the case of interaction with an engineered out of resonance reservoir , i.e. for @xmath139 . by using the techniques for reservoir engineering typical of trapped ion systems , such region of the parameter space is already in the grasp of the experimentalists . indeed , by slightly modifying the experimental conditions used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the oscillatory non - markovian dynamics of the heating function can be measured @xcite .        in order to characterize completely the dynamics of the quantum brownian particle in the non - lindblad region we look at the dynamics of the squeezing , of the mandel parameter and of the wigner function for some exemplary initial states .",
    "we begin with the analysis of the squeezing in position . by using eq .",
    "( [ xp ] ) , it is possible to derive the following expression for the variance of the dimensionless position operator @xmath9 : @xmath157 + \\delta_{\\gamma}(t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & e^{-\\gamma(t ) } ( \\delta x)_{\\rm f}(t ) + \\delta_{\\gamma } ( t ) , \\label{deltax2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the initial variances of position and momentum operators , respectively , and @xmath160 is the initial position - momentum correlation function . in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ deltax2 ] ) we have defined the function @xmath161 describing the time evolution of the variance of a quantum harmonic oscillator in absence of interaction with the environment . in the high temperature limit , it is not difficult to prove that the interaction with the environment generally causes an increase in the variance of the position operator with respect to its free dynamics .",
    "indeed , for times much smaller than the thermalization time @xmath162 , eq .",
    "( [ deltax2 ] ) may be approximated as follows @xmath163 where eqs .",
    "( [ gamma])-([deltagamma ] ) have been used .",
    "having in mind that for high temperatures the condition @xmath164 holds , one realizes that , provided that @xmath165 is not too big ( corresponding to either a very high initial squeezing in position / momentum or a very high initial position - momentum correlation or a mixture of these cases ) , the integral appearing in eq .",
    "( [ deltax2a ] ) gives always a positive contribution . in the short time non - markovian regime , for low reservoir temperatures , situations in which the system - environment correlations lead to a decrease in the squeezing in position , compared to its free time evolution , may in principle occur .",
    "such a situation would be of interest since it could be exploited to generate squeezing through the interaction with an artificial low temperature reservoir .",
    "we plan to investigate further this point in the future .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezing ] ( a ) we plot the short time behavior of @xmath166 for an initial squeezed state with squeezing factor @xmath167 , that is with @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we remind that @xmath9 and @xmath170 are dimensionless , therefore squeezing in position corresponds to @xmath171 . in the figure we compare the time evolution of the position variance for the damped harmonic oscillator with the case of the isolated harmonic oscillator . from the figure one sees clearly the effect of the virtual processes which tend to decrease the position variance and to bring it back to its initial value .",
    "the overall effect of the environment tends however to wash out the initial squeezing .",
    "let us now consider the time evolution of the mandel parameter @xcite @xmath172 this quantity gives an indication of the statistics of the quantized mode described by the system oscillator . for a fock state @xmath43 takes its lowest value @xmath173 while for",
    "a coherent state @xmath43 is equal to @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath175 indicate subpoissonian statistics , while @xmath176 characterizes poissonian statistics and @xmath177 superpoissonian statistics . using eq .",
    "( [ xp ] ) we have derived the time evolution of the mandel parameter as follows @xmath178}{\\langle n(t ) \\rangle}. \\label{eq : q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezing ] ( b ) we show the time evolution of the mandel parameter for an initial fock state @xmath179 . due to the interaction with the artificial reservoir the initial temporal evolution",
    "is characterized by oscillations between subpossonian and poissonian statistics of the quantized mode .",
    "this behaviour may be traced back to the virtual photon exchanges between the system and the reservoir and therefore is typical of the non - markovian non - lindblad - type region .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) , and remembering that @xmath180 , and that @xmath181 , it is easy to convince oneselves that , if the initial state is poissonian or superpoissonian , i.e. @xmath182 , the mandel parameter will remain positive at all times . in other words ,",
    "the interaction with the environment never creates subpoissonian statistics from an initial poissonian or superpoissonian statistics .",
    "this conclusion is valid for generic temperatures @xmath46 , provided that the weak coupling assumption is satisfied .",
    "we now look at the the system dynamics in the non - lindblad regime , considering the time evolution of the wigner function of an initial coherent state @xmath183 . having in mind",
    "( [ chit ] ) and recalling that the wigner function is simply the fourier transform of the quantum characteristic function , @xmath184 one gets @xmath185 } \\exp \\left [ \\frac{\\left| \\alpha_0 e^{-\\gamma(t)/2 } e^{-i \\omega_0 t } - \\alpha \\right|^2}{\\delta_{\\gamma } ( t ) + 1/2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation and from fig .",
    "( [ fig : wigner ] ) one sees clearly that the system - reservoir interaction spreads the initial wigner function .",
    "breathing of the wigner function , that is the oscillation in its spread , appears in correspondence of the virtual processes .",
    "this is a new dynamical feature which is absent both in the markovian dynamics of the damped harmonic oscillator and in the lindblad - type non - markovian dynamics .",
    "indeed , in both the previous regimes , the spread in the wigner function simply increases , linearly in time in the markovian case , and quadratically in time in the non - markovian lindblad - type case .",
    "we note that different breathing scenarios for the second moments in different regimes have been discussed in @xcite .    in summary , the exchanges of energy between system and reservoir characterizing the non - lindblad type region strongly influence the dynamics of the system .",
    "in general , if the initial state of the oscillator possesses nonclassical properties ( as squeezing or subpoissonian statistics ) , the interaction with the environment tends to wash out such properties in a time scale which is dependent , as one would guess , on the reservoir parameters ( spectral density and temperature ) . in this section",
    "we have considered a high @xmath46 engineered out of resonance(i.e . with @xmath139 ) reservoir . in this case",
    "the loss of nonclassical properties appears in a time scale which is smaller or equal to the reservoir correlation time @xmath186 .",
    "moreover , the effect of the virtual processes , which is also important in this time scale , may cause oscillations between classical and nonclassical states , as in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezing ] ( b ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the situation here considered , the loss of nonclassical properties , as well as the oscillations due to virtual processes , happen in a time scale which is in general much shorter than the decoherence time @xmath187 , with @xmath188 separation between the two components of a quantum superposition and @xmath189 de broglie wavelenght @xcite .",
    "this is clearly related to the high temperature condition of interest here , which implies @xmath190 .    in order to give a more quantitative estimate one should",
    ", however look at some specific physical system , in order to fix also the other quantities appearing in the definition of the two time scales . to this aim",
    "we consider the recent experiment with trapped ions in which the decoherence of different superpositions of the vibrational motion of the center of mass of the ion was observed @xcite . for this system",
    ", this experiment has shown that decoherence of a superpositon of two fock states happens on a time scale of the order of @xmath191s .",
    "very recently we have proposed an experiment @xcite to observe non - markovian features of the heating function in the same system and with the same set up used in @xcite . according to our calculations , by slightly modifying the experimental parameters used",
    ", one could observe oscillations in the heating function in a time scale of the order of @xmath192s , that is one order of magnitude less than the decoherence time measured in that system for a superposition of fock states .",
    "in conclusion , the investigation carried out in this section sheds light on the short time dynamics of the damped harmonic oscillator , focussing in particular on the high @xmath46 regime .",
    "further analysis of the squeezing , of the mandel parameter and of the wigner function may bring new insight in the time scales governing the loss of nonclassical properties and in their relationship with the decoherence and dissipation time scales .",
    "we plan to explore further this aspect , with particular attention to the low temperature case .",
    "in this paper we have studied the short time non - markovian dynamics of a quantum brownian particle moving in a harmonic potential .",
    "the dynamics of this paradigmatic open quantum system is described by a non - markovian master equation which is local in time .",
    "this master equation can not be recast in the lindblad form . nevertheless , under certain conditions , the master equation for quantum brownian motion is of lindblad type , i.e. it has the same operatorial form of the lindblad master equation but with time dependent ( instead of constant ) positive coefficients .    in the weak coupling limit , the relevant time dependent coefficients can be cast in a closed form . in this case by using the exact analytic solution in terms of the quantum characteristic function , we have identified the parameters governing the passage from lindblad type to non - lindblad type master equation .",
    "these parameters are the reservoir temperature @xmath46 and the ratio @xmath136 between the frequency @xmath2 of the system oscillator and the reservoir cutoff frequency @xmath32 .",
    "it is worth stressing that the weak coupling limit we consider in the paper is of interest also in the light of the engineering of reservoir experiments .",
    "in fact , in order to observe experimentally the key features of the system - reservoir interaction , e.g. the role played by the entanglement between system and reservoir in the decoherence process , the coupling between system and reservoir does not have to be too strong .",
    "the stronger is the coupling the faster is the establishment of quantum correlations between the system and the environment , and the more difficult is the experimental observability of their dynamics .",
    "for this reason the techniques of reservoir engineering , allowing to control both the coupling constant and other reservoir parameters as its spectral density , look very promising for investigating fundamental issues as the quantum - classical border .",
    "our analysis of the short time non - markovian region shows that the lindblad type dynamics is characterized by a monotone increase of the heating function , and therefore of the energy , of the open system . in the non - lindblad type region , on the contrary , oscillations in the mean energy of the system clearly indicate the occurrence of virtual exchanges of energy between the system and the reservoir . lowering the reservoir temperature increases the probability that virtual processes take place .",
    "it is worth noting that whenever the master equation for the system is of lindblad type , it is possible to apply the standard mc simulation schemes and there exists a direct correspondence between the mc simulation method and a continuous measurement scheme @xcite . for more general non - markovian monte carlo methods ,",
    "e.g. the nmwf we have used in this paper , an analogous correspondence would be of interest .",
    "there are indications that the lindblad non - lindblad border might be identified with the border between existence and non - existence of a measurement scheme interpretation for non markovian stochastic methods .",
    "for this reason , the study of the dependence of this border from parameters as the reservoir temperature and the ratio @xmath136 might give some insight and useful hints to the research on this contemporary topic .    finally , last part of our paper deals with an analytic description of the short time dynamics of the quantum brownian particle when virtual processes dominate .",
    "we have investigated in detail the temporal evolution by looking at the squeezing properties , at the mandel @xmath43 parameter and at the wigner function .",
    "we have found that , if the system initially possesses nonclassical properties as squeezing in one of the quadratures or non - poissonian statistics , these properties tend to be washed out due to the interaction with the reservoir .",
    "however oscillations between squeezing and non - squeezing as well as between sub - poissonian and poissonian statistics appears in connection with the virtual exchanges of energy .",
    "a further sign of the virtual processes is the breathing in the width of the wigner function .",
    "summarizing , the main result of this paper is the detailed analysis of the non - markovian features characterizing the dynamics of a quantum brownian particle , with special attention to the appearance of virtual processes for certain ranges of reservoir temperature and cutoff frequency . due to",
    "the generality of the model here studied we think that our results can both contribute to fundamental research on open quantum systems and , when applied to specific physical contexts , shed light on their dynamics .",
