    "from the beginning of modern cosmology , it has been realised that both the curvature and topology of the observable universe may be nontrivial ( e.g. , @xcite  1917 ; @xcite  1958 ) , but the fact that objects at cosmological distances are seen in our past time cone has meant that constraints on topology suffer astrophysical complications just as do the constraints on curvature and on the hubble constant .",
    "the empirical tradition in cosmology requires that observations are used to constrain both curvature and topology .",
    "theoretical indications that the topology should be nontrivial are not lacking , however . indeed ,",
    "observational indications are that the curvature of the universe is either negative or zero , implying that for a trivial topology the volume would be infinite .",
    "this implies that the requirement of quantum gravity with a `` no - boundary '' boundary condition ( e.g. , hawking 1984 ; zeldovich & grishchuk 1984 ) that the universe be compact is not satisfied by a trivial ( simply connected ) topology .",
    "a multi - connected negatively curved ( or flat ) universe of finite volume provides such compactness .",
    "a completely independent argument for compactness is from unified particle physics theories which imply that most of 10 or 11 dimensions of the fundamental `` strings '' are `` compactified '' .",
    "if the volume of the universe were infinite , it would seem somewhat arbitrary that the three space dimensions are an exception to the compactification of the other dimensions .",
    "( this argument is known as `` dimensional democracy , but where some dimensions are more equal than others '' , @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1945 . )",
    "multi - connectedness can save a finite , non - positively curved universe .",
    "a third argument comes from inflationary theory for negatively curved universes .",
    "observational difficulties with an @xmath7 universe have stimulated inflation models which predict that @xmath8 ( @xcite  1982 , 1986 ; @xcite  1993 ; @xcite  1995 ; for consequences on the cosmic microwave background , see @xcite  1994 ; @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "however , inflation resulting in negative curvature at the present epoch requires fine - tuning the initial conditions , which is provided in these models by an earlier period of inflation . in that case the inflationary potential is designed in order to yield such `` double inflation '' . on the other hand , multi - connectedness in a negatively curved universe implies chaoticity of geodesics , and so naturally provides the smooth initial conditions for a single period of inflation which results in observable curvature at the present ( @xcite  1996 ) .",
    "lachize - rey & luminet ( 1995 ) present an extensive introductory review of how one can understand non - trivial topology in a standard hot big , bang ( friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ) universe , examples of many of the known ( orientable ) topologies possible , and of observational efforts to measure or constrain the topology .",
    "however , the reader is reminded here of the simplest example of a three - dimensional topology , for trivial curvature  the hypertorus .",
    "one can think of the entire universe as a cube , of side length at least several hundred or thousand mpc , of which opposite faces are physically identified .",
    "a particle such as a photon may travel between two points in space , e.g. , from object to observer , by a direct route `` within '' the cube , or may `` pass through '' the faces of the cube several times in travelling from one point to the other . hence , many `` ghost '' images at ( in general ) differing celestial positions and ( in general ) differing redshifts ( due to differing light travel time ) would be seen .",
    "of course , in proper coordinates , this cube expands in size according to the scale factor , so that detection of non - trivial topology has to be done in comoving coordinates .",
    "this embedding within infinite , flat , three - dimensional space is only an aid to our intuition  the space outside the cube does not have physical significance , although it is useful mathematically . the infinite space ( or a hyperbolic or elliptic infinite space for other curvatures )",
    "is termed the `` universal covering space '' ; the cube ( or in other cases other polyhedra of which faces are identified in some way ) is termed the `` fundamental polyhedron '' . following @xcite  1995 , the shortest distance from an object to any of its `` ghost '' counterparts",
    "is @xmath9 , and the largest distance from an object to an adjacent ghost ( where there is an adjacent ghost for each face of the fundamental polyhedron ) is @xmath10 .",
    "the most direct way of attempting to detect the topology of the universe is by searching for individual ghost images of known objects in the universal covering space .",
    "that is , objects observed in the past time cone are assumed to exist in a simply - connected universe , at distances they would have ( assuming zero peculiar velocity ) within the simply - connected spatial hypersurface at @xmath11 .",
    "this covering space would contain many copies of the fundamental polyhedron .",
    "constraints obtained by this technique ( e.g. , @xcite  1974 ; @xcite  1980 ; @xcite  1985 , 1989 ; @xcite  1987 ) give constraints on @xmath12 to a few tens or hundreds of mpc or else find ghost image candidates statistically consistent with chance coincidences .",
    "several recent attempts have been made to use the essentially two - dimensional slice of the covering space which temporally corresponds to the period of recombination , i.e. , which spatially is the surface of last scattering observed as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the cobe satellite ( @xcite  1993 ; @xcite  1993 ; @xcite  1994 ; @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "these methods rely upon our present understanding of the local physics at the redshift of last scattering and require various assumptions , e.g. , assume a toroidal topology , and claim limits to a few thousand mpc .",
    "an interesting advance in techniques of finding candidate manifolds , of hyperbolic ( negative ) curvature , is that of @xcite  ( 1996 ) , in which possible identifications between cmb cold spots and galaxy superclusters are used to predict expected positions ( @xmath13 ) of further ghosts of superclusters .",
    "observational confirmation or refutation of such candidate manifolds is obviously straightforward .",
    "three topology - independent methods either for three - dimensional catalogues of objects spread over large scales ( @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1996 ) or for the cmb ( @xcite  1997 ) now provide alternatives to the search for individual ghosts and the cmb methods cited above .",
    "however , the subject of this paper is an extension of the traditional and simplest method , the search for ghost images of individual objects .",
    "the explanation of why x - ray clusters are probably the best `` topology standard candle '' available on scales of about @xmath14  mpc is presented in ",
    "[ s - xray ] , cases of specific clusters are discussed in  [ s - individ ] and a summary is given in ",
    "[ s - concl ] .    for brevity of discussion , and",
    "because of the theoretical motivations for a finite volume universe , the use below of the terms `` multi - connected '' and `` non - trivial topology '' should be taken to imply the finite volume cases only unless otherwise specified .    for reference , the reader should be reminded that the horizon is at @xmath15  mpc from the observer , and the horizon diameter is @xmath16  mpc .",
    "( except where otherwise stated , distances are quoted in comoving units in an @xmath4 universe and @xmath5 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 is explicitly indicated ; cluster luminosities and masses implicitly include the assumptions that @xmath17 )",
    "the einstein , asca and rosat satellites have shown that many galaxy clusters contain hot , bremsstrahlung , x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this is in fact the case for nearly all of the richest ( abell richness class @xmath18 ) clusters , and those not detected may be undetected only due to the flux limit of the surveys ( @xcite  1993 ) .",
    "the richest clusters therefore provide what is probably the best `` topology standard candle '' available on scales of about @xmath14  mpc : ( 1 ) clusters should look fairly similar  in x - rays or optically in the statistical distribution of galaxies  from any direction ; ( 2 ) once the ( rich ) cluster exists , evolution of the x - ray emitting gas is likely to be only possible in one direction  to greater mass and/or greater mass concentration  the x - ray luminosity could probably not decrease by more than about a factor of two .",
    "these two properties are ideal for searching for ghosts .",
    "property ( 1 ) , isotropy , is useful since except in special cases , ghosts are likely to be viewed from different angles , so the main objects visible at large redshifts , quasars , are going to be much fainter when seen from many angles ( according to unified models of active galactic nuclei they would be seen as , e.g. , seyfert galaxies ) .",
    "this is why @xcite s  ( 1996 ) statistical method is unlikely to be useful for quasars , so @xcite s  ( 1996 ) method of searching for individual configurations was developed .",
    "property ( 2 ) , the evolutionary constraint , is equally useful .",
    "up to the redshift of rich cluster formation , probably @xmath19 the rarity of the largest clusters in a simply - connected universe should imply that surveys to larger and larger volumes should yield successively rarer and higher mass clusters , simply since the higher the mass of a cluster the rarer it should be .    on the other hand , a multi - connected universe of finite size smaller than the observed volume must contain a cluster of maximum mass ( for precise enough bins in mass determination ) , which forcibly has at least one ghost image in the copy of the fundamental polyhedron which includes the observer .",
    "ghosts of the maximum mass cluster in copies of the polyhedron at higher redshifts are likely to be of identical or lower mass , if it is accepted that the cluster can only gain in mass once formed .",
    "hence , in a simply - connected universe , more and more massive ( and rare ) clusters should be seen to successively larger redshifts ( up to the formation epoch of such clusters ) , while in a small enough ( finite volume ) multi - connected universe , once _ the _ most massive cluster has been seen , no clusters of greater mass should be seen at higher redshifts .    in other words ,",
    "property ( 2 ) not only implies that x - ray emitting ( rich ) clusters would in principle be possible to see as ghost images , but the existence at a `` high '' redshift of a single such cluster which is much more massive than all the others at lower redshifts provides a strong constraint _ against _ multi - connectedness up to the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the key elements of this constraint are merely gravity and conservation of mass",
    ".      what are the possibilities for evolution of the gas component , which generates the x - ray luminosity ?",
    "this is likely to depend mostly on the mass of the cluster .",
    "observational links between the x - ray luminosity of a cluster , @xmath20 and the gas temperature , @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite  1991 ; @xcite  1991 ) , combined with a theoretical isothermal potential @xmath22 relation ( where @xmath23 is the virial mass ; e.g. , @xcite  1996 ) , indicate that @xmath24 while this relationship is not evolutionary , it at least suggests that if the mass of a cluster changes , its luminosity is likely to increase strongly .",
    "direct attempts to measure @xmath25 evolution with redshift @xmath26 have had diverse results ( @xcite  1990 ; @xcite  1990 ; @xcite  1992 ; @xcite  1995 ; @xcite  1997 ) , but @xcite  ( 1996b ; 1997 ) point out that several of the analyses may have suffered selection effects , and find no significant evolution for x - ray selected rosat clusters to @xmath27",
    "even if the suggestions of `` negative '' evolution were correct , this would mean that @xmath25 increases with time , strengthening the usefulness of clusters as topological standard candles .",
    "these results seem reasonable theoretically . since the gas is a much larger component ( by mass ) than the galaxies , and given the time , length and mass scales involvedmpcgyr@xmath28 , there is little possibility that the hot gas can collapse mostly into galaxies ( or @xmath29 clouds ) or be blown out of the cluster over several gigayears .",
    "so the gas must remain in the cluster , and since , at least to a good first approximation ( apart from cooling flows ) , is in isothermal equilibrium in the potential well of the cluster , the density distribution is unlikely to change by much .",
    "since the x - ray emission is believed to be bremsstrahlung emission due to particles accelerating in a potential well of @xmath30 it seems physically unlikely that this emission could be suppressed by large factors",
    ".    the most physically reasonable scenarios for evolution of the gas distribution ( and the overall mass distribution ) would be for the density distribution to become more centrally concentrated or for the mass to increase somewhat due to gas ( and galaxies ) still infalling into the cluster .",
    "these cases would agree with the emss data analysis ( @xcite  1994 ; @xcite  1997 ) suggesting increase of @xmath25 with time .",
    "interaction with another large cluster might possibly loosen up the central concentration ( the core ) , but such a case is likely to be both rare and easy to spot .",
    "of course , a significant fraction of cluster x - ray luminosity often comes from what are ( usually believed to be ) cooling flows ( e.g. , @xcite  1995 ) . over a hubble time",
    "a cooling flow could feed a few percent of the cluster mass into the centre of the cluster , not significantly changing the ( approximately ) isothermal gas distribution .",
    "if a cooling flow ceased between the epochs of two ghost images , the x - ray luminosity could decrease by as much as a factor of two , lowering the chances of detection above a given flux limit .",
    "however , this would again ( by energetic considerations ) require collision with another large cluster .",
    "so , it is difficult to see how ghosts of `` high redshift '' x - ray clusters at lower redshifts could be too faint to have been detected .",
    "observational ( or observationally deduced ) parameters of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 @xcite  ( 1996 ) and of some of the most highly luminous x - ray clusters which could be candidates for a ghost image of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 are listed in table  [ t - clusters ] .",
    "these luminosities ( in the @xmath31  kev band , as illustration ) are shown graphically in in fig .",
    "[ f - lxplot ] .",
    "rxj  1347.5 - 1145 is clearly exceptional relative to the other massive clusters .",
    "the argument presented in ",
    "[ s - xray ] that brighter ( or more massive ) , hence , rarer clusters should be seen to higher and higher redshifts ( up to the cluster formation epoch , and assuming little evolution ) is also illustrated in this figure . from the @xcite  ( 1976 ) function fit to the rosat brightest cluster sample of @xcite  ( 1997 ) it is straightforward for a given redshift to predict the luminosity such that clusters of that luminosity become `` common '' enough ( one occurrence ) in the increased available volume to be visible in surveys .",
    "this `` brightest observable cluster in a finite volume '' statistic is shown both for a universe of trivial topology and for a universe of non - trivial topology with a fundamental polyhedron diameter , for illustration purposes , of 600@xmath32  mpc .",
    "if rxj  1347.5 - 1145 did not exist , previous astrophysical object based limits on the diameter of the fundamental polyhedron ( e.g. , @xcite  1996 ) would be consistent with the existence of the other bright clusters represented .",
    "one might be encouraged to search for signs of identity among the four @xmath33 clusters shown in fig .",
    "[ f - lxplot ] , or to look for ghosts of these objects at higher redshifts .",
    "however , rxj  1347.5 - 1145 does exist , and its discovery at a moderately high redshift does not imply that clusters were brighter in the past , it is simply consistent with being a rare cluster requiring a large search volume , under the assumptions of a trivial topology of the universe and no significant luminosity evolution !    nevertheless , we do consider some possibilities of ghost images of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 below .",
    "could the coma cluster be a low redshift image of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 ?",
    "this would obviously be of tremendous usefulness in understanding both cluster and galaxy evolution , given the huge time lag between the two images .",
    "both clusters have two large `` central dominant '' ( cd ) galaxies at their centres ; the total masses are identical within the uncertainties [ @xcite s ( 1992 ) rosat mass estimate for coma implies a total mass of @xmath34 to @xmath35  mpc ) and @xmath36 to @xmath37  mpc ; @xcite give @xmath38 and @xmath39 for rxj  1347.5 - 1145 to the same radii respectively ] ; and the gas fraction to a large radius appears lower in coma , but consistent within the uncertainty .    however , the much preciser x - ray fluxes and core ( @xmath40  kpc ) surface brightnesses are much higher for rxj  1347.5 - 1145 than for coma .",
    "if the ghost of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 were to lie as close to us as coma , without any reduction in the bremsstrahlung luminosity of the hot ( and cooling ) gas , then it would have a @xmath31  kev x - ray flux of @xmath41  erg / s/@xmath42 , which is six times as bright as the perseus galaxy cluster and ten times coma itself .",
    "for rxj  1347.5 - 1145 and coma to be ghost images of one another , this would require not only removal of the cooling flow , but also some means of further reducing the hot gas emission by a factor of about ten .",
    "moreover , the core gas would have to be radically redistributed in the @xmath43gyr ( for @xmath4 ) time lapse between the observed two emission epochs .",
    "for this to be done , as suggested above , by collision with another cluster , this second cluster should be visible close to rxj  1347.5 - 1145 in the rosat pointed observations or should be detectable in moderately deep optical imaging over a 1015@xmath44 field around the cluster .",
    "so it seems difficult to see how coma could physically be identical to rxj  1347.5 - 1145 .",
    "the fact that the redshifts of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 and cl  09104 + 4109 are similar provides a time scale argument against these two clusters being physically identical .",
    "since the redshifts are close , we in fact see cl  09104 + 4109 at an epoch only 35@xmath32  myr ( for @xmath4 ) later than rxj  1347.5 - 1145 , since the light travel times are indicated by the redshifts , irrespective of topology .",
    "a very ir - luminous quasar is seen in cl  09104 + 4109 , but a strong ir source has not been found in rxj  1347.5 - 1145 . if the ordering here were the opposite , an estimate of the lifetime of the ir emission @xmath45  myr would make it hard to understand why the emission is not seen in rxj  1347.5 - 1145",
    ". however , rxj  1347.5 - 1145 is the earlier image , so we can only consider the probability that two nearly simultaneous snapshots of the cluster happen to occur before and during the period of ir emission .",
    "what is the likely lifetime of the far - ir emission ?",
    "starlight from stars created by the process causing the quasar , e.g. , galaxy merging , reradiated in the far - ir is a likely candidate . a typical dynamical time scale for such an event , supposing this involves two typical large galaxies of @xmath46 is about @xmath47  myr ( e.g. , @xcite  1991 ) , while the massive stars formed during this period would remain on the main sequence for about this much time afterwards .",
    "@xcite  ( 1988 ) estimate that quasar lifetimes are likely to be at most about a gigayear . in either case , in the case of physical identity of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 and cl  09104 + 4109 , it would seem to be about a 10% coincidence that we happen to see one ghost image just before the event started and one during the event .",
    "most of the other candidate ghost images of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 listed in table  [ t - clusters ] seem to be of lower luminosity and are at lower redshifts , requiring a reduction in @xmath25 with time in order to be identical with rxj  1347.5 - 1145 , which as discussed above is physically unlikely . on the other hand , a2163 is at lower redshift than rxj  1347.5 - 1145 , but is considerably more massive , making it too an unlikely ghost candidate .",
    "could a ghost of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 be hiding in the galactic plane ?",
    "the fraction of the soft x - ray flux absorbed by the galaxy varies from 1020% at the galactic poles to 95% on the plane ( assuming a galactic plane column density of @xmath48  @xmath49 for @xmath50 ) .",
    "this problem is even worse if one considers the detected rosat count rate which is predominantly at 1  kev where the detected count rate is down by 98% on the plane . at a galactic latitude of @xmath51 the fraction of absorbed flux is about 5060% ( with a large variance ) , so studies in soft x - rays ( e.g. @xcite  1993 )",
    "are limited to the two thirds of the sky at higher latitudes .",
    "the existence of a ghost in the plane is therefore a possibility , which can not easily be excluded .",
    "however , this is a fundamental limitation to any search for individual ghost images , which affects all other candidate objects .",
    "one future possibility would be for the abrixsas satellite to perform an all - sky survey in hard ( @xmath52  kev ) x - ray bands , in which the galactic plane is substantially more transparent .",
    "however , in this case , since it would be difficult to confirm any hard x - ray detected candidate clusters at other wavelengths , a physical test for distinguishing clusters from other sources in the infrared or using the hard x - ray data alone ( e.g. , from surface brightness profiles ) would need to be established from the sources at high galactic latitudes . whether or not this is feasible remains to be seen .      while the `` local physics '' arguments just presented argue against either coma or cl  09104 + 4109 being ghost images of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 , it is quite exciting to note nevertheless that examination of the three - dimensional positions of these bright clusters yields a geometrical pattern indicative of a candidate multi - connected manifold ; specifically , a hypertorus , of which two side lengths are just under @xmath53  kpc .",
    "rxj  1347.5 - 1145 , the coma cluster , and the cluster cl  09104 + 4109 ( @xcite  1997 ) form nearly a right angle ( @xmath1 ) with arms of nearly identical length ( @xmath2 and @xmath3  mpc respectively ) for @xmath4 curvature .",
    "of course , the cmb analyses cited above specifically concentrate on the case of a hypertoroidal universe , since this is the simplest of non - trivial topologies possible , so it is unlikely that a hypertorus on the scale required for identity of the three clusters has managed to escape attention so far .",
    "however , this geometrical configuration is one which has already been searched for among other objects ( e.g. , quasars , @xcite  1987 ) , and was found among a very small number of candidate objects , so it is certainly interesting to consider independently of the cmb analyses .",
    "the mapping from the universal covering space to a single copy of the fundamental polyhedron , which in this case is assumed to be a cube ( although other possibilities for the third dimension could be considered ) , is very simple . by forcing the three clusters to form an exact right angle of arms ( axes ) of identical length , and choosing the third axis to be at right angles to the first two and of the same length",
    ", the transformation from the universal covering space to the fundamental polyhedron is simply @xmath54 \\label{e - hyper}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the ( three - dimensional ) position of any astrophysical object , @xmath56 is the orthonormal basis listed in table  [ t - basis ] , @xmath57 is the side length of the fundamental cube and @xmath58 is the object s position translated into the fundamental cube and expressed in the coordinate system of the orthonormal basis .",
    "function should be modified for use with negative values of @xmath59 . ]",
    "readers can easily use this transformation to check for themselves whether or not catalogues of objects at large redshifts transformed into the ( candidate ) fundamental cube happen to coincide with one another  as should be the case if the transformation is due to a genuine physical identification .",
    "an example of such an application is shown here , using a list of 5007 quasar positions ( from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , ned ) , the highly luminous clusters discussed above , a few large superclusters , and the cold spots in the cmb tentatively attributed to density peaks ( @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "the positions of all these objects are transformed to the fundamental cube and plotted in fig .",
    "[ f - qobs ] . rotation of the fundamental cube by an arbitrary angle ( i.e. , no physical justification ) gives a control sample in fig .",
    "[ f - qsim ] .",
    "if identical quasars were seen as several different ghost images , then more close pairs should be seen in the map based on the cluster - derived fundamental cube than that based on the arbitrarily rotated fundamental cube .",
    "an excess of close pairs is not obvious to the eye , and a two - point correlation function ( using 10 different control samples ) confirms the lack of any statistical difference",
    ".    it could be the case that the angles of the fundamental cube are not perfect right angles , or that the sides are of slightly unequal lengths , but in that case the quasars should still follow large scale structure , on a scale of about @xmath60  mpc ( e.g. , @xcite  1986 ; @xcite  1989 ; @xcite  1993 ; @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "again , the two - point correlation function shows no quantitative difference between structure in the case of the candidate fundamental cube and the control cases .",
    "note that the large scale variations in quasar density are due to the quasar catalogue containing a variety of observational catalogues over small areas of the sky , as well as large solid angle surveys .",
    "this is not a sign of multi - connectedness .",
    "the group transformation indicated in eq .",
    "[ e - hyper ] and table  [ t - basis ] could also be applied to search for other copies of the `` corners '' of the fundamental polyhedron , each position at which another image of the ( hypothetically single ) cluster rxj  1347.5 - 1145/coma / cl  09104 + 4109 should be visible . since coma is nearly at the location of the observer , many of these images",
    "would be hidden behind one another .",
    "however , the four images at @xmath61 [ written as ( @xmath26 , @xmath62 @xmath63 ) ] would not be hidden .",
    "firm constraints on the existence or non - existence of clusters at these positions , within uncertainties similar to the difference of the observed cluster triplet from an exact right angle of equal arm lengths ( i.e. , of order 1% ) , should be relatively easy to obtain observationally .",
    "again , our closeness to coma implies that the images should be seen at similar redshifts to those of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 and cl  09104 + 4109 , so the possibility that they are much fainter than these two clusters would require corresponding changes in luminosity over very short time intervals .",
    "the lack of obvious candidate ghost images at these positions in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) provides an additional argument against the candidate topology suggested .",
    "however , for other candidate topologies which retain the identification of the three observed clusters , but are not simply @xmath64 with three equal fundamental lengths , ghost images would only have to be seen at positions @xmath65 and @xmath66 the near-``antipodes '' of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 and cl  09104 + 4109 .",
    "rass exposure in the direction of @xmath65 is not deep enough to exclude a counterimage cluster and rxj  203150.4 - 403656 is a plausible candidate at @xmath67 so , spectroscopy to determine the redshift of the latter and an optical ( or x - ray ) search for a cluster within @xmath68 of ( @xmath69 ) and within @xmath70 of @xmath71 would be needed to rule out variants on the candidate manifold suggested .",

    "[ f - lxplot ] , the probability of the occurrence of rxj  1347.5 - 114 at this distance is quite high .",
    "even the anthropic argument would not seem to be much help here .",
    "highly luminous x - ray clusters are a robust probe for finding ghost images of astrophysical objects which would reveal the possible non - triviality of the topology of the universe .",
    "this is because observational statistics indicate that these clusters are likely to increase ( or at a minimum retain the same ) x - ray luminosity as time increases ; while theoretically , gravity and conservation of matter imply that it is hard to see how the situation could be different for individual clusters .",
    "observations of successively brighter ( more massive ) rich clusters at higher redshifts implies successively greater volumes in which the universe must be simply connected , while observation of the most x - ray bright ( most massive ) cluster at a redshift well below that to which virialised clusters are ( eventually ) discovered would be a clue to a multi - connected universe . in the latter case , this brightest cluster would have ghost images among the population at higher redshifts .",
    "the apparent lack of ghosts of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 implies a lower limit to the size of the fundamental polyhedron , @xmath75 of about @xmath76  mpc ( for @xmath4 ) .",
    "this limit could be doubled in size , without having to observe to fainter flux limits than those of the rosat all - sky survey , by a survey through the galactic plane in hard x - rays , if some means of confirming which sources are clusters could be found ( e.g. , by surface brightness profiles combined with spectral shapes ) .",
    "the consideration of highly luminous x - ray clusters has indicated what is geometrically an exciting candidate identification of ghost images .",
    "rxj  1347.5 - 1145 , the coma cluster and the cluster cl  09104 + 4109 together form what is nearly a right angle of nearly equal arm lengths , just what would be expected for a hypertoroidal geometry ( for flat curvature ) .",
    "the inferred transformation from the covering space to the fundamental cube is presented in table  [ t - basis ] and eqn  [ e - hyper ] .",
    "however , the local physical properties of these three clusters do not seem to support identity ; cmb constraints against hypertoroidal topologies have been well studied ; a mapping of @xmath77 quasar three - dimensional positions into the implied fundamental cube of the hypertoroidal manifold does not support identity ; not all of the expected four extra ghost images of rxj  1347.5 - 1145 and cl  09104 + 4109 are obvious ; and the probability that we are as close as we are to the historically brightest cluster in the universe rxj  1347.5 - 1145/coma / cl  09104 + 4109 would be only @xmath78    nevertheless , observations to determine the redshift of rxj  203150.4 - 403656 and to search for a cluster within @xmath68 of ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 of @xmath71 would be useful to rule out ( or detect ! ) variants on the candidate manifold suggested .",
    "we thank the ( anonymous ) referee for a careful reading of the paper and useful suggestions . this work has partly been carried out under a centre of excellence foreign visiting fellowship of the japanese ministry of education ( monbush@xmath79 ) and",
    "has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
