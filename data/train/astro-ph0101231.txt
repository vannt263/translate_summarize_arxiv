    "understanding the composition and spectral features of cosmic rays has always been an astrophysical challenge .",
    "on one hand , the observational data have long been scarce and suffered from large uncertainties . on the other hand , the theoretical predictions",
    "to which these data should be compared to have also suffered from several drawbacks .",
    "composition and spectra arise from the nuclear interaction of an initial distribution of energetic particles with interstellar matter ( _ spallations _ ) and their electromagnetic interactions with galactic magnetic fields ( _ acceleration _ and _ diffusive reacceleration _ ) .",
    "first , the nuclear cross sections to be used were not very well known until recently .",
    "second , our knowledge of the galactic magnetic field is far from complete .",
    "cosmic rays are sensitive to its scale inhomogeneities ( _ diffusion _ ) which are not well observed .",
    "they are also sensitive to the presence of plasma shock  waves ( acceleration in localized sources and diffusive reacceleration ) .",
    "third , composition and spectra are altered as the cosmic rays enter the solar magnetic field , so that some more modelling has to be done in order to infer interstellar spectra from observations .",
    "however , despite these sources of uncertainty , some gross features of the cosmic ray properties are well established .",
    "first , the study of secondary  to  primary ratio shows that a cosmic ray has crossed an average of about @xmath9 of interstellar matter between its acceleration and its detection .",
    "second , the isotopic ratio of radioactive species shows that it took about @xmath10 between the same events . as cosmic rays",
    "have a velocity close to @xmath11 , we can infer the average density of the medium to be @xmath12 . as the disk density is about @xmath13",
    ", the cosmic rays must spend a fraction of time in an empty region , called the _",
    "diffusion halo_. cosmic rays are produced and destroyed in the galactic disk , they diffuse in a larger zone whose characteristics are not well known , and eventually they can escape from this zone . to have a good modelling of cosmic ray propagation , we should know the geometry and size of the diffusion zone , the characteristics of the galactic magnetic field , and the sources .    in this paper , we use the existing data on nuclei , gathered by balloon  borne and space experiments during the last thirty years , to put constraints on the parameters describing the propagation of cosmic ray nuclei .",
    "one consequence is that many of the large uncertainties affecting the calculation of the antiproton flux could be strongly reduced ( f. donato & al . , in preparation @xcite ) .",
    "this is of utmost relevance for the study of exotic sources of antiprotons and antideuterons .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that the relevant physical propagation model to be used is the diffusion model ( berezinskii & al . 1990 ; ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) , though the so  called leaky box model has been widely preferred for decades because of its simplicity .",
    "the steady  state differential density @xmath14 of the nucleus @xmath15 as a function of energy @xmath16 and position @xmath17 in the galaxy , is given by ( see for instance berezinskii & al .",
    "1990 ) @xmath18 the first terms represent diffusion ( @xmath19 is the diffusion coefficient ) and convection ( @xmath7 is the convection velocity ) .",
    "the divergence of this velocity , expressed in the next term gives rise to an energy loss term connected with the adiabatic expansion of cosmic rays .",
    "further , we have to take into account ionization and coulombian losses ( the energy loss coefficients are specified below ) , plus a reacceleration term in first order derivative ( all included in @xmath20 ) and finally a second order derivative in @xmath16 for the associated second order term in reacceleration ( @xmath21 is the energy diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "these stand for the continuous losses .",
    "the last term of the l.h.s .",
    "takes care of the disappearance of the nucleus @xmath15 ( @xmath22 for short ) due to its collisions with interstellar matter ( ism ) . in the r.h.s .",
    ", the source term @xmath23 takes into account the primary production and acceleration of nuclei described by an injection spectrum ( for the sake of clarity , we have not written down the terms describing the contribution of radioactive species ) . finally , the last term is for the secondary @xmath15 sources , namely spallation contribution ] ] @xmath24 from all other heavier nuclei .",
    "we use here the notation @xmath16 for total energy and @xmath25 for kinetic energy .",
    "one needs to solve a complete triangular  like set of coupled equations since only heaviest nuclei contribute to a given nucleus .",
    "quantities in this equation are functions of spatial coordinates ( not time , steady",
    " state being assumed ) and of energy .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the word _ energy _ will stand for _ kinetic energy per nucleon _ ( @xmath26 ) , since this is the appropriate parameter to be used , as it is conserved in spallation reactions ( see footnote  2 ) .",
    "the other very popular model is the leaky box , in which all the quantities are spatially averaged ( so that convection has no meaning ) , and the diffusion term is then replaced by an escape term @xmath27 which has the meaning of a residence time @xmath28 ( myr ) in the confinement volume .",
    "note that in this case , the mean time @xmath29 spent in the box and the mean column density @xmath30 ( in units of g@xmath31 ) of crossed matter are treated on the same footing since the model is homogeneous .",
    "this is not true for multi ",
    "zone models and especially for the diffusion model where cosmic rays spend most of their time in the diffusion halo which has a zero matter density .",
    "it may seem very surprising that this simplified model is able to reproduce many observations on stable nuclei .",
    "actually , it can be shown that leaky box models are often equivalent to diffusion models , as far as stable species are concerned ( for a generic discussion on the  leakage  lifetime \" approximation in cosmic ray diffusion , see jones 70 ) .",
    "this is not obvious from the equations , but it can be seen more readily if we solve them in a formalism called the weighted slab technique . basically , it consists in writing a general solution under the form ( see for example berezinskii et al .",
    "1990 ; ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) @xmath32 thus , ( [ equation la plus generale ] ) decouples into two independent equations .",
    "the first one involves @xmath33 .",
    "it depends only on the geometry of the problem and on the chosen diffusion scheme ( or the leaky box parameters ) , but not on the particular species @xmath15 .",
    "the other one involves @xmath34 and contains the nuclear physics aspects of the propagation .",
    "different models ( diffusion or leaky box ) correspond to different @xmath33 , but the equations on @xmath34 are the same .",
    "@xmath35 is the path length distribution and is interpreted as the distribution of probability that a nucleus @xmath15 goes through a column density @xmath36 before reaching earth .",
    "the global solution is then obtained by a convolution of the surviving quantity @xmath34 under nuclear processes after @xmath37 , with the weighted probability associated .    in a leaky box model",
    ", it can be shown that the normalized path length distribution function is given by @xmath38 where the average quantity of matter crossed by a cosmic ray is given by @xmath39 in the diffusion model , it has been shown ( owens 1976 ) that for a wide class of geometries , the function @xmath35 is given by an infinite series of exponentials involving the diffusion coefficient . moreover , the physical parameters are such that for sufficiently large grammage @xmath36 , only the first exponential contributes so that we recover a leaky box model ( jones 1970 ; ginzburg , khazan & ptuskin 1980 ; schlickeiser & lerche 1985 ; lerche & schlickeiser 1985 ) . for the model used in this paper , it can be shown that @xmath40 in the limit @xmath41 . however ,",
    "this is no longer true for lower @xmath36 , and then the leaky box model fails .",
    "this may explain , in conjunction with poorly known cross sections for heavy nuclei , why for many years cosmic ray physicists had to use modifications ( lezniak & webber 1979 ; garcia  munoz & al .",
    "1987 ; webber & al .",
    "1998b ) of the leaky box path length distribution at small grammage to reconcile observations of b / c with those of sub  fe / fe .",
    "even worst , this approximate equivalence between leaky box and diffusion model breaks down for radioactive species ( prishchep & ptuskin 1975 ) .",
    "this motivates us to choose the diffusion model and solve the corresponding equation  ( [ equation la plus generale ] ) . from a more general point of view , note also that the weighted slab technique mentionned above should be used carefully .",
    "actually , it was recently realized ( ptuskin , jones & ormes 1996 ) that pre1996 estimations of cosmic ray parameters with this technique were not exact .",
    "first , at fixed energy per nucleon , the rigidity and therefore the propagation features depend on the nuclear species , whatever the energy . this prevents the above  mentionned decoupling .",
    "second , energy losses that strongly depend on @xmath42 and @xmath43 also take place at low energy .",
    "ptuskin et al .",
    "1996 presented a modification of this formalism which is correct in both the highly and non ",
    "relativistic regimes .",
    "these fundamental findings were confirmed by a more complete numerical treatment ( stephens & streitmatter 1998 ) and give rise to differences of as much as 20% .    for the nuclear part , we adopted the direct approach of the shower technique .",
    "this means that the flux is first evaluated for the heavier primary cosmic ray , for which the diffusion equation is simple and does not couple to any other species .",
    "then , the flux of the next nucleus is computed , with a spallation term depending only on the heavier nucleus , whose flux is known from the previous step .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all the nuclei down to the lightest one .",
    "we started at @xmath44 , the heavier non negligeable primary found in cosmic radiation ( binns & al .",
    "1989 ) , since @xmath45 fe . for all light nuclei",
    ", we checked that it is sufficient to start from @xmath46 ( s ) .",
    "for the detail of solutions , the reader is referred to appendix  [ sec : sol diffusion model ] .",
    "the next section is devoted to the inputs of the model .",
    "the geometry of the problem used here is a classical cylindrical box ( see for example webber et al .",
    "1992 ) whose radial extension is @xmath47 , with a disk of thickness @xmath48 and a halo of half ",
    "height @xmath5 .",
    "only @xmath5 is not fixed ( see @xmath49[sec : results ] ) and @xmath50 , @xmath51 . sources and interactions with matter",
    "are confined to the thin disk and diffusion which occurs throughout disc and halo with the same strength is independent of space coordinates .",
    "the solar system is located in the galactic disc ( @xmath52 ) and at a centrogalactic distance @xmath53 ( stanek & garnavich 1998 ; alves 2000 ) .",
    "cross sections play a crucial role in propagating the cosmic rays throughout the galaxy .",
    "we have to distinguish bewtween the total inelastic cross section and the spallation cross section .",
    "the total inelastic cross section , which is actually a reaction cross section , is defined by @xmath54 various empirical modifications of the original ( bradt & peters 1950 ) geometrical approach have been used to parameterize this total cross section .",
    "letaw , silberberg & tsao ( 1983 ) and silberberg & tsao ( 1990 ) produced the basic energy dependent equations further refined in sihver & al .",
    "( 1993 ) and in wellish & axen ( 1996 ) .",
    "recently tripathi , cucinotta & wilson ( 1997a , 1997b , 1999 ) proposed a universal parameterization which is valid for all nucleus ",
    "nucleus reactions , including neutron induced reaction .",
    "all of these approaches have been compared in silberberg , tsao & barghouty ( 1998 ) , where the preference were given to tripathi et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b , 1999 ) . for this reason",
    ", we adopted the latter parameterization throughout this study .",
    "the precision can be estimated to be about @xmath55 .",
    "the fragmentation cross sections are somewhat more complicated .",
    "basically , we can separate three distinct approaches  : ( i ) microscopical description ( bondorf & al . 1995 ; ramsey & al . 1998 ) ( ii ) semi  empirical formulae ( silberberg et al . 1998 ; tsao , silberberg & barghouty , 1998 ; tsao et al .",
    "1999 ) and ( iii ) empirical formulae ( webber , kish & schrier 1990d ) .",
    "the first one takes into account the fundamental nuclear physics but is very computer time consuming and has not reached a precision as good as the two other approaches .",
    "the second method takes into account more phenomenological inputs , and is better designed for the unmeasured fragmentation cross sections which correspond mainly to the ultra heavy ( @xmath56 ) nuclei .",
    "the third one breaks down in this region , but can be used for @xmath57 because it is adapted to fit measurements .",
    "consequently , we used the code of webber et al .",
    "( 1990d ) available on the web   updated with new parameters ( table  v of webber & al .",
    "this parameterization takes advantage of the fact that about @xmath58 of all the reaction involved in cosmic ray propagation have now at least one point of energy measured .",
    "this set of formulae gives a precision of about @xmath59 but can not be further refined ( webber et al .",
    "the code is extended for spallation on he with the parameterization given in ferrando et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ( p. ferrando 2001 , private communication ) . ] .    to go further than this treatment",
    ", one should keep in mind the following points .",
    "first , the process of single or double nucleon removal is an important channel for the production of numerous nuclei .",
    "it has been parameterized in detail in norbury & townsend ( 1993 ) and in norbury & mueller ( 1994 ) , although in the following we will consider webber s approach sufficient for our purpose .",
    "second , most of the parameterizations make use of the straight ",
    "ahead approximation ( see footnote  2 ) .",
    "tsao & al .",
    "( 1995 ) relaxed this condition and find a 5% effect around the @xmath60 peak of b / c ( note that this effect is negligable for primary to primary and secondary to secondary ratios ) .",
    "finally , it was found that all the measurements are not always consistent and systematic effects are likely to be present ( taddeucci & al .",
    "1997 ; vonach & al . 1997 ; zeitlin & al .",
    "1997 ; flesh & al . 1999 ; korejwo & al . 1999 ) .    to summarize",
    ", we consider that webber s code is very well suited for modelling spallation cross sections , thanks to the many experiments developed these last years ( webber , kish & schrier 1990a , 1990b , 1990c ; webber et al .",
    "1998b , 1998c ; chen et al .",
    "the overall precision can be roughly estimated to be better than 10% on h , and better than 20% on he .",
    "apart from the stable species , we can distinguish two categories of nuclei to be propagated , depending on whether they live long enough to be observed or they decay quickly into other nuclei .",
    "ghost nuclei are defined as those having a half  lifetime larger than @xmath61 ( so that they are detected in cross section measurements ) and less than few hundred years ( so that we can consider that disintegration is fast on a propagation timescale ) .",
    "several reaction channels may yield a given nucleus .",
    "this means that for this nucleus , we have to add to the direct production the contributions of all the short lived parent nuclei @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the branching ratio of the corresponding channel @xmath64 ] .",
    "a table of all the disintegration chains can be found in letaw & al .",
    "1984 . to see the effect of the recent discovery of new intermediate short  lived nuclei and of the changes in branching ratio , we reconstructed from a recent compilation of nuclear properties ( audi et al .",
    "1997 ) all the ghost nuclei and compared them with the letaw table .",
    "we found that the net effect is negligible .",
    "this is because the discovered radioelements are very far from the valley of stability and their production is suppressed ( as it can be observed experimentally ) .",
    "such reaction chains should accordingly be taken as a fixed input for the future .",
    "radioactive nuclei can be separated into three groups  : unstable under @xmath65 decay , unstable under electronic capture and unstable under both reactions .",
    "all the physical effects related to these nuclei will be analysed in detail in a separate paper ( f. donato & al . , in preparation @xcite ) .",
    "physically , diffusion arises because charged particles interact with the galactic magnetic field inhomogeneities .",
    "this is an energy ",
    "dependent process because higher energy particles are sensitive to larger spatial scales . as a result",
    ", the diffusion coefficient is related to the power spectrum of these inhomogeneities , which is poorly known .",
    "several analytical forms of this energy dependence have been assumed in the literature . in particular , leaky box models give a purely phenomenological form @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for the particle rigidity .",
    "a more fundamental origin may be found for the previous expression , as one can show in a one  dimensional diffusion model with convection ( jones & al .",
    "all the effects that led to that phenomenological form are explicitely taken into account in our treatment and we may therefore consider a more natural form for @xmath2 , inferred from magnetohydrodynamics considerations ( ptuskin et al .",
    "1997 ) : @xmath68 where the normalisation @xmath3 is expressed in kpc@xmath69 .",
    "nevertheless , we have also tested leaky box inspired forms , but these never give good fits to the data ( see next section ) .",
    "a charged particle is called a cosmic ray when it has been accelerated to an energy greater than @xmath70 as far as our study is concerned .",
    "several physical processes may be responsible for this energy gain ; they all involve an interaction of the particle with a plasma shockwave front .",
    "this is responsible for the power ",
    "law energy dependence ( see below ) .",
    "the term _ source _ refers to the place where the charged particles have been promoted to cosmic rays .",
    "we present here the various hypotheses about their spatial and spectral distributions and their compositions .",
    "first , as explained above , we assumed that the galaxy has a cylindrical symmetry and that the sources are located in the galactic disc .",
    "so we only have to specify a radial distribution .",
    "we have used the case & bhattacharya ( 1996 , 1998 ) distributions , but the results presented below are not sensitive to this particular choice .",
    "the source spectral distributions can be split in two terms @xmath71 where @xmath72 represent the composition and @xmath73 the energy dependence .",
    "several spectra have been used in the past ( engelmann & al . 1985 ) ,",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 is the momentum and where the spectral index @xmath76 may depend on the species @xmath15 considered .",
    "these forms are equivalent at high energies but we focused on the first one only ( equivalent to a power  law in rigidity ) as the others do not yield good fits to the data .",
    "the sum @xmath77 gives the overall power ",
    "law index of each species at high energy ( @xmath78 ) : this is because the measured flux at these energy is proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "in other words , at sufficiently high energy , energetic redistribution and spallation reactions do not affect propagation .",
    "consequently , measured spectral indexes enter as a fixed input , and we took them in wiebel  sooth , biermann & meyer ( 1998 ) . for consistency",
    ", we required that whatever @xmath4 , the parameters @xmath76 are adjusted so as to reproduce the above  mentionned values .",
    "this ensures that the spectra we compute agree with data at high energy .",
    "the composition @xmath80 is usually inferred from a comparison between leaky box calculations and data .",
    "alternatively , a more fundamental approach can be used .",
    "it may be taken either as the solar system composition convoluted with the fip ( first ionisation potential ) , or convoluted with the volatility . as pointed out in webber ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the two alternatives are not so different . in this work ,",
    "the isotopic composition of each element was taken from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , and the @xmath81 dependence of the fip has been taken from binns et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . then the primary cosmic ray",
    "elemental composition has been adjusted to fit the heao3 data at @xmath82 , while keeping constant the relative isotopic abundances .",
    "once we have chosen a generic model , we have to include effects which affect the spectra at low energies .",
    "a first step is the inclusion of energetic losses .",
    "then a most complete treatment must take into account reacceleration and convection .",
    "there are two types of energy losses which are relevant for nuclei : ionization losses in the ism neutral matter ( @xmath83% h and @xmath84% he ) , and coulomb energy losses in a completely ionized plasma , dominated by scattering off the thermal electrons .",
    "we will use @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ( nordgren 1992 ) .",
    "complete formulae for these two effects are compiled , for example , in strong & moskalenko ( 1998 ) or in mannheim & schlickeiser ( 1994 ) .",
    "there is also a third type of loss related to the existence of a galactic wind .",
    "we recall that in equation ( [ equation la plus generale ] ) , there is a term proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "as we choose a constant wind velocity in the @xmath88 direction ( see farther ) , we could conclude at a first glance that this term vanishes .",
    "actually , this is the case everywhere in the galaxy except at @xmath52 where a discontinuity occurs , due to the opposite sign of the wind velocity above and below the galactic plane .",
    "one gets a term that can be expressed in the same form as ionization and coulombian losses with an effective term @xmath89 @xmath25 stands for the total kinetic energy and it should not be confused with the kinetic energy per nucleus frequently used in this paper . finally ,",
    "because of these effects the propagation equation must be solved numerically .",
    "as the fractional energy changes in a single collision are small , we can treat fermi acceleration ( fermi 1949 ; 1954 ) using the fokker ",
    "planck formalism ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) . in one dimension @xmath90     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are expressed in terms of the probability for changing the momentum @xmath75 to @xmath93 during time @xmath94 .",
    "a simplification occurs when the recoil of the scatterer can be ignored . in general , the principle of detailed balance ensures that the probability for a gain is equal to that for a loss .",
    "this implies @xmath95 which reduces the equation into @xmath96 where @xmath97 from another point of view , we can start with a collisionless boltzmann equation and expand it up to second order in perturbed quantities ( magnetic irregularities ) .",
    "it gives the full diffusion equation in quasi ",
    "linear theory ( schlickeiser 1986 ; kulsrud & pearce 1969 ) . assuming a constant flow of magnetic irregularities ( corresponding to a constant galactic wind ) in the @xmath88 direction , we find @xmath98         + q(r , p , t)\\ ] ] which is the propagation equation we used in appendix  [ sec : sol diffusion model ] ( up to several nuclear terms , cf eq .",
    "( [ equation generale ] ) ) . in this theory , the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath99 is naturally connected to the space diffusion coefficient @xmath100 by the relation @xmath101 where @xmath6 is the alfvn speed of the scattering centers .",
    "we emphasize that expressions  ( [ detailed balance approx ] ) and  ( [ chic 0 ] ) are just simplifications of the full fokker  planck equations . as pointed out by ostrowski & siemieniec - oziblo ( 1997 ) ,",
    "if this simplification is natural in the kinetic description of a gas of scattering particles , this is no longer the case for particles scattered off external ` heavy ' scattering centers .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation which arises in a number of astrophysical cases is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "we thus have to treat a simple energy diffusion coefficient , which we evaluated in the no  recoil hard sphere scattering centers approximation as @xmath102 where @xmath103 describes the rate of collisions with scatterers which is related to the mean free path by @xmath104 . as @xmath105 , the previous relation gives the final coefficient to be used in our calculation @xmath106    our approch is basically similar to that of heinbach & simon ( 1995 ) .",
    "the meaning of the alfvnic speed derived in their analysis is not very clear , since the numerical factor in front of expression  ( [ all is for the butter ] ) may vary according to the hypotheses made for the scattering process .",
    "the assumption that reacceleration occurs only in the thin disc is supported by recent complete magnetohydrodynamics simulations ( ptuskin et al .",
    "1997 ) describing the evolution of the hot gas , cosmic rays and magnetic field .",
    "we define @xmath107 and with @xmath108 given by ( [ all is for the butter ] ) , one obtains ( see appendix ) @xmath109 this is a second order equation which is solved for each order @xmath110 of the bessel decomposition .",
    "@xmath111 is given by ( [ si ai ] ) and @xmath112 ( [ sources ] ) is a generic source term ( see appendix  [ sec : sol diffusion model ] for details ) .",
    "relation  ( [ robert ] ) has been developed on our energy array so as to be transformed into a matrix equation that is directly inverted .",
    "two boundary conditions need to be implemented .",
    "the effects of energy losses and diffusive reacceleration have been assumed to be negligible at the high energy tip ( @xmath113 ) of the spectrum .",
    "we have furthermore imposed a vanishing curvature ( @xmath114 ) at the lowest energy point .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that a thin disc configuration would be disrupted by cosmic ray pressure ( parker 1965 , 1966 ; ko , dougherty & mckenzie 1991 ) .",
    "it can be stabilized by the presence of a halo , but further considerations imply that this halo would not be static either ( presence of a convective wind ) .",
    "consequences of a wind has been firstly investigated by ipavitch ( 1975 ) and since then it has been observed in other galaxies ( lerche & schlickeiser 1982a , 1982b ; reich & reich 1988 ; werner 1988 ) . in our own , its effects on nuclei",
    "have been investigated in various models ( jones 1979 ; kta & owens 1980 ; freedman & al .",
    "1980 ; bloemen & al . 1993 ) , and in this work we adopted a very simple and tractable form for @xmath7 throughout the diffusive volume ( @xmath115 ) , following webber , lee & gupta ( 1992 ) .",
    "a constant wind with free escape boundary is a reasonable approximation to a more sophisticated variable  wind model ( see also conclusions from magnetohydrodynamics simulations ( ptuskin et al .",
    "1997 ) ) .",
    "our semi  analytical two  dimensional model lies , in some sense , between the complete numerical resolution of strong & moskalenko ( 1998 ) and the recent study of jones et al .",
    "as compared to the first one , we have a simplified description of the matter distribution , for which the full analysis of the parameter space does not require too much cpu time .",
    "the second approach can be considered as the limiting case for our two  dimension model when the radial extension is much larger than the halo size ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "note that a similar analysis was performed by letaw , silberberg & tsao ( 1993 ) in the framework of a leaky box model or seo & ptuskin ( 1994 ) in a one  dimensional diffusion model but their less systematic approach does not allow a full exploration of parameter space .",
    "for the aim of our analysis , we can consider different classes of flux ratios : primary  to  primary ( _ e.g. _ c / o ) , secondary  to  primary ( _ e.g. _ b / c or sub  fe / fe ) , secondary  to  secondary ( _ e.g. _ li / b or be / b ) , ratio of isotopes either stable ( _ e.g. _ @xmath117 ) or unstable ( _ e.g. _ @xmath118 ) .",
    "each of these may be an indicator of some dominant physical phenomenon and be particularly sensitive to the corresponding diffusion parameters .",
    "the ratio of two primaries is practically insensitive to changes in all the parameters , since they have the same origin and undergo the same physical processes .",
    "so , it can be a very useful tool to fix their source abundances .",
    "we will return to this subject .",
    "similar conclusions , even if less strong , may be drawn for the ratio of two isotopes of the same species , such as @xmath117 . indeed , at very low energy values this quantity is slightly affected by changes in the injection spectra , but the effect is too weak to constrain free parameters .",

    "the shape of this ratio is seriously modified by changes in the diffusion coefficient , in the height of the diffusion halo , in the convective and alfvnic velocities .",
    "moreover , it is also the quantity measured with the best accuracy , so that it is ideal to test models . indeed , being the ratio of two nuclei having similar z , it is less sensitive to systematic errors than single fluxes or other ratios of nuclei with more distant z. for the same reasons , the sub  fe / fe may also be useful . unfortunately ,",
    "since existing data are still affected by sizeable experimental errors , we can only use them to cross  check the validity of b / c but not to further constrain the parameters under scrutiny .",
    "another particularly interesting quantity is the ratio @xmath118 .",
    "since @xmath119 is a radioactive element , it is very sensitive to the processes which can occur in the halo .",
    "therefore , we could use this ratio in particular to bracket the size of the halo ( f. donato & al .",

    "we have estimated the effect of the solar wind on the energies and intensities of cosmic ",
    "rays following the prescriptions of the force field approximation ( perko 1987 ) .",
    "the modification in the total interstellar energies of a nucleus with charge @xmath43 and atomic number @xmath42 , corresponds to the shift @xmath120 ( we set the electronic charge equal to unity ) : @xmath121 here @xmath122 and @xmath123 correspond to the top  of  atmosphere ( modulated ) and interstellar total energy , respectively .",
    "the solar modulation parameter @xmath124 has the dimension of a rigidity ( or an electric potential ) , and its value varies according the 11years solar cycle , being greater for a period of maximal solar activity . often people refer to the equivalent quantity @xmath125 .",
    "once the momenta at the earth @xmath126 and at the boundaries of the heliosphere @xmath127 are determined , the interstellar flux of the considered nucleus is related to the toa flux according to the simple rule : @xmath128 the determination of the modulation parameter @xmath129 is totally phenomenological and suffers from some uncertainty . as explained in the following",
    ", we will deal with data taken around period of minimal solar activity , for which we fixed @xmath130 .      in order to test our diffusion model",
    "we have widely employed the data taken by the experiment which was launched on board the nasa heao3 satellite ( engelmann et al .",

    "for the case of b / c , heao3 quoted errors are 23@xmath131 . to perform the analysis",
    ", we also included data from balloons ( dwyer & meyer 1987 ) and from the isee3 experiment ( krombel & wiedenbeck 1988 ) , even if the relevant error bars are wider . the first one collected data in 197375 for energies spanning from around 1.7 to 7 gev / n .",
    "the second experiment was operating during 197981 on board a spacecraft , in the energy range 100200 mev / n . in some of the figures presented below , we also plot  for purely illustrative goals  the data point from imp8 ( garcia  munoz et al . 1987 ) and the voyager experiments ( lukasiak , mcdonald & webber 1999 ) ( we did not include ulysse data point ( duvernois & al .",
    "1996 ) , since it corresponds to a period of maximal solar activity ) .",
    "they were not included in the @xmath0 analysis since they are the most sensitive to solar modulation .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that the best @xmath0 values were not significantly modified when these points were added .    as regards the sub ",
    "fe(sc+v+ti)/fe ratio , we used data from heao3 ( engelmann et al .",
    "1990 ) and from balloons ( dwyer & meyer 1987 ) . in both cases",
    "the error bars , around 10@xmath131 , are significantly larger than for b / c .",
    "we varied the relevant parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 of the diffusion model described above .",
    "the constraints are much simpler to express with the combinations @xmath5 , @xmath132 , @xmath7 and @xmath133 ( this last expression appears naturally in @xmath134 describing reacceleration ) . as for the primaries",
    ", we have adjusted the source abundance for nitrogen which is not a pure secondary .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0 over the 26 experimental points listed in [ sec : dataset ] , for each possible combination obtained varying the free parameters in the whole parameter space . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on b / c and we cross  check the compatibility of the obtained parameters when applied to other fluxes .      in a first step , the power @xmath4 of rigidity in the expression for the diffusion coefficient ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion_coefficient ] ) ) has been fixed to 0.6",
    ". this will be the reference value for the bulk of our analysis .",

    "the best models have @xmath136 .",
    "some of these configurations have a very small halo size in which case the condition @xmath137 is no longer valid .",
    "thus we also required @xmath138 in the whole analysis .",
    "the first result is that only the source spectrum @xmath139 gives a good fit to the data .",

    "however , there is still a degeneracy .",
    "it should be lifted with further specific analysis of radioactive nuclei ( f. donato & al .",

    "conversely , for each @xmath133 and @xmath7 we varied @xmath5 and @xmath132 and the best values for the @xmath0 are depicted in fig .",

    "we do not find any model having a good @xmath0 without convection ( @xmath143 ) or without reacceleration ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "we emphasize the fact that these four parameters are strongly correlated so that , when one of them is determined ( for example @xmath5 with radioactive nuclei ) , the allowed ranges for the others will be narrower than what could naively appear from the above two figures .",
    "the observed sub  fe / fe flux ratio does not give very powerful constraints . nevertheless , all the models which give a good fit to b / c data are consistent with sub  fe / fe data .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig1bis ] illustrate these results with the particular choice @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , giving a reduced @xmath149 .",
    "note that all the configurations lying in the allowed ranges of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] will provide very similar curves .    up to now",
    "we have dealt with flux ratios , which partially hide the spectral features of the fluxes themselves .",
    "so we have also checked that the above configurations were consistent with the oxygen flux as measured by heao3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1ter ] the oxygen flux has been calculated for the same configuration as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig1bis ] .",
    "we can notice that the agreement with heao3 data is not so satisfactory .",
    "the parameter which mainly prevents us from obtaining a good fit is the source spectrum .",

    "we also tested different values for @xmath4 , and we find that correspondingly the diffusion parameters giving a good fit to b / c change . as an example , for a fixed value of the halo thickness @xmath154 , we find that @xmath4 is allowed to vary between @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
