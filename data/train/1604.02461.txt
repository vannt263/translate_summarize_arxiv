    "brane world models have gained attention with the development of string theory . they are meant to be phenomenological implementations of more fundamental stringy models .",
    "although extra - dimensional scenarios already have a long history @xcite , the more recent brane perspective of the universe offers new insights and challenges .",
    "the main characteristics of string inspired brane worlds is that standard model fields are confined to a four - dimensional hypersurface , the brane , while gravity propagates in a larger spacetime , the bulk @xcite .",
    "a basic challenge of any brane world model is to explain why gravity , in large scales , is approximately described by standard newton s law .",
    "one approach is to consider that the extra dimensions are compactified .",
    "this is the starting point of the arkani - hamed - dimopoulos - dvali ( add ) models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , brane worlds where the extra dimension is noncompact , can also be implemented .",
    "the simplest models in this context are the randall - sundrum brane worlds , which describe our universe as a domain wall embedded in a five dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "black holes in standard general relativity and in extra - dimensional scenarios are important sources of gravitational waves , and the recent direct observation of gravitational perturbations @xcite opened a new window to test extra - dimensional models . also , according to some setups with extra dimensions , it is possible that small black holes could be produced ( and detected ) in particles collisions in tev energy scale @xcite , implying that quantum gravity may show itself already at the current particle accelerators .",
    "but , while cosmological brane solutions are abundant , the construction of bulk spacetimes describing compact objects in a brane is not straightforward .",
    "for instance , the natural generalization of the schwarzschild metric to randall - sundrum models corresponds to an infinite black string extended through the fifth dimension , whose induced metric on the brane is purely schwarzschild @xcite . however , although the curvature scalars are everywhere finite , the kretschmann scalar diverges at the ads horizon at infinity , turning the black string into a physically unsuitable object .",
    "also , usual @xmath0-brane black holes in dimensions higher than four are generically unstable due to the mechanism presented by gregory and laflamme @xcite .    given the relative complexity in the derivation of exact bulk solutions modeling compact objects in randall - sundrum scenarios , one practical alternative is to build four - dimensional geometries in the brane and invoke campbell - magaard theorems @xcite , which guarantees their extensions through the bulk ( at least locally ) .",
    "this approach has been used by several authors in the treatment of compact objects in randall - sundrum branes ( for example in @xcite ) and will be employed in the present work .",
    "our description of black holes in a randall - sundrum scenario will be done from the point of view of a brane observer .",
    "four - dimensional effective gravitational field equations obtained by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki @xcite are assumed to describe gravity in the brane . within this context",
    ", we derive new spacetimes deforming the vacuum solution with the techniques introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the geometries obtained here could be considered as a subset of the possible solutions that could be algorithmically generated in the approach suggested in @xcite if additional restrictions are imposed .",
    "however , following our approach , we have obtained completely integrated exact solutions .    considering the perturbative aspects of the brane spacetimes , a detailed investigation of scalar and gravitational perturbations in brane world backgrounds",
    "was conducted in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we extend that previous investigation considering a more phenomenological perturbation , maxwell s electromagnetic field @xcite , evolving in the new brane geometries derived here .",
