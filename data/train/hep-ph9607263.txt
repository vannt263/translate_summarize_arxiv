    "with the proposed experiments for heavy ion collisions at the lhc coming closer , the onus has settled on the theoretical physics community to provide a clear , coherent and credible description of such collisions .",
    "one of the major goals , that of detecting the presence of plasma formation of the constituent quarks and gluons is for both theorists and experimentalists alike , a formidable task .",
    "such a phase is believed to be formed as matter is deconfined .    from the theoretical side , a description that goes beyond the standard equilibrium statistical approaches is necessitated by the short collision time of the ions , since this may preclude equilibration of all degrees of freedom .",
    "thus a transport theory that is consistently based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) itself is required . while such formulations have been set up by some authors @xcite ,",
    "they have not reached the stage where they can be implemented to provide original physical results .",
    "one step in this direction is to examine the consequences of a transport theory based on an effective model of qcd , that exhibits some important features of the theory . in particular",
    ", it is desirable to see if any major effects due to the exhibited feature are observable in the final analysis .",
    "it is well - known that the low energy particle sector is well described by effective chiral theories of qcd .",
    "we therefore choose to implement the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite in its three flavor extension for such a study .",
    "this model has the advantage that , being a model , it can be studied over the entire temperature range .",
    "the njl model also offers a simple intuitive view of chiral symmetry breakdown and restoration via a realization of the pairing mechanism of quark and antiquark states of an effective interaction in a similar sense to the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "the model suffers however from several unaesthetic diseases : the simple form of a point - like interaction , while making the model analytically tractable , also ensures its nonrenomalizability , and a cutoff scale @xmath7 for the theory must be introduced .",
    "a confinement / deconfinement phase transition can not occur .",
    "rather a `` soft '' form of deconfinement is observed at the so - called mott temperature , at which the mesons dissociate into their constituents @xcite .",
    "the njl model , being a strong coupling field theory , can not be handled in perturbation theory .",
    "the by now standard technique is a self - consistent expansion of quantities to be calculated in the inverse number of colors @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is this expansion , taken to lowest order , that we use in our model .    in order to make some progress in the ambitious task presented , we have already studied hadronization processes of quarks and antiquarks into two mesons , @xmath9 @xcite , within the @xmath3 njl model . in addition , we require the elastic scattering cross sections for both quarks and quarks @xmath10 and quarks and antiquarks @xmath11 within the three flavor model .",
    "the cross sections for the third possible class , @xmath12 , follow immediately from @xmath10 by time reversal invariance , as long as no chemical potential is involved .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to calculate these cross sections , together with the attendant transport properties ( mean free paths and shear viscosities ) in the @xmath3 model for realistic values of the current quark masses @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we note that some elastic scattering cross sections have been calculated in the two flavor sector with the additional restriction of the chiral limit condition @xmath15 in ref .",
    "as will be seen , the extension presented here indicates significant increases in the cross sections due to additional available channels .",
    "the quark quark scattering cross sections are relatively featureless . on the other hand",
    ", quark antiquark scattering shows a threshold divergence at the mott temperature @xmath16 , at which the pion dissociates into its constituents . at higher temperatures that are to be expected in the plasma phase ,",
    "a large resonant structure is observed , that is a remnant of this feature of critical scattering .",
    "this is however not directly observable .",
    "when these cross sections are included in a fully consistent transport theory based on this chiral model of qcd , it is hoped that this may lead to observable effects .",
    "we have also studied transport coefficients witin this model .",
    "we find that the viscosity coefficient @xmath17 lies in the range 0.83 to 1.0 per flavor degree of freedom for light quarks , and is slightly lower for strange quarks , being 0.68 to 0.75 , i.e. the _ total _ viscosity is found to lie between 3.2 and 4.0 considering only two flavors , while for three flavors the total viscosity would lie between 4.6 and 5.5 .",
    "perturbative qcd estimates lie slightly higher than this value : a variational calculation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) gives @xmath18 for two quark flavors , where @xmath19 is the strong coupling strength .",
    "one finds the value @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "this should be viewed somewhat critically , since this perturbative formula is strictly valid for @xmath22 , and is an extremely sensitive function of @xmath19 . in the strongly interacting non  perturbative regime , it is not applicable .",
    "hydrodynamical estimates , on the other hand @xcite , give a wide range for this quantity , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the proper time for the expansion of the system .",
    "we also calculate mean free paths for light and heavy flavors and these are found to be of the order of magnitude of 1  fm .",
    "the thermal relaxation times are found to vary between 12  fm/@xmath6 , with that of the strange quark being slightly higher .    in order to discuss strangeness enhancement , we examine the chemical relaxation time for strange quarks within the model .",
    "these , lying between 11  fm/@xmath6 and 17  fm/@xmath6 , are considerably higher than the naive perturbative qcd prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite that proceeds via gluon fusion .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy can be traced back to the value of the strange quark mass @xmath25 . in the perturbative qcd calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the physical mass was assumed to be equal to the current quark mass value . in the njl model ,",
    "on the other hand , a significantly enhanced value of the strange quark mass is still found at temperatures of the order of 250  mev @xcite .",
    "in fact it is at least twice the current quark mass value .",
    "a recalculation of the perturbative qcd calculation using the temperature dependent njl masses gives relaxation times of the same order of magnitude as our calculation .",
    "we note that an assessment of the relevance of quark antiquark scattering for the strangeness enhancement that is observed e.g. in @xmath5 collisions , depends on the plasma lifetime .",
    "our calculations would attribute the observed enhancement to these processes for a plasma lifetime of ca .",
    "4  fm/@xmath6 .",
    "such a value is supported by hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "this places an upper limit on the plasma lifetime . for shorter times , other mechanisms , including hadronization @xcite and final state interactions must also be invoked .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ scatsec ] , we first give a brief review of essential formalism , then we discuss quark quark scattering in the nonstrange and strange sectors . following this , quark antiquark scattering for both nonstrange and strange partons",

    "the masses are not shown explicitly here  the calculation is standard and has been given in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "in particular , to this level of approximation , the quark self energy is always real , even in a thermal medium , while the mesonic self energies are complex , depending on various parameters .    given this circumstance , we have calculated quark  quark and quark  antiquark scattering processes . in a simplistic fashion , by analogy with the boltzmann equation , we are able to extract transport coefficients , and in particular , lifetimes , which have been discussed in detail in section  [ secthree ] .",
    "these lifetimes imply of course that the @xmath89 , @xmath236 and @xmath150 quarks carry widths that are inversely proportional to these .",
    "thus one sees , that , while this is a consistent chiral and @xmath8 expansion , it is _ not _ a self  consistent calculation of the _ widths_. in order to do so , one must go _ beyond _ the lowest order @xmath8 calculation .",
    "several attempts to do this @xcite and also to include finite temperature @xcite have difficulties either in including all possible terms , and/or maintaining chiral symmetry . a first calculation @xcite that attempts to go further and calculate the quark widths self  consistently ignores the consistent calculation of the meson sector , and thus violates chiral symmetry requirements at this level .",
    "we find that our widths @xmath237 are of the order of 200  mev and lie somewhat below the values quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this discussion",
    ", we wish to point out that there are contradicting expansions that one can examine .",
    "it has always been a fixed tenet of transport theory that truncations should be energy and _ symmetry _ conserving , and we have thus based our calculation on this . clearly more work is required to incorporate the higher order terms in a self  consistent fashion that can also determine quark widths in medium simultaneously . as such , we can at best regard our transport theory results as estimates that may be compared with other similarly made estimates .",
    "finally it is perhaps worth commenting that the correct inclusion of the quasi particles with widths is extremely important . in the calculation of ref .",

    "the imaginary part of the self energy can also be shown to be connected with memory effects @xcite .    in concluding this section ,",
    "it is evident that , within the njl model , an expansive study that constructs a transport theory that accounts for all these problems , still requires substantial development .",

    "the remnants of the critical scattering , i.e. resonant structures that occur in the @xmath150channel , are clearly visible and enhance the cross sections substantially in comparison with the background .",

    "the total viscosity coefficient for two flavors is found to be a factor roughly two smaller than previous @xmath34 calculations .",
    "this is attributable to the enhanced cross sections that enter into this @xmath3 calculation .",
