    "double perovskite ( dp ) materials of the form a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 are being actively studied @xcite on account of their unusual electronic and magnetic properties . in particular ,",
    "some double perovskites , _ e.g _ , sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 , show half - metallic behaviour , high ferromagnetic @xmath4 , and large low field magnetoresistance . remarkably , there are also double perovskites that are antiferromagnetic and insulating .",
    "the metallic and magnetic character depends primarily on the choice of b and b , but is also affected by the _ local ordering _ of these ions .",
    "while it is desirable to understand the interplay of structural , electronic and magnetic variables in these materials within an unified framework , it is technically daunting to ` anneal ' all these degrees of freedom simultaneously .",
    "we argue that it is reasonable to abstract the problem of structural order , solve it , and then set up the electronic - magnetic problem on the appropriate structural motif .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in the next section we present the overall model for the dp s , involving the structural , magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom , and",
    "indicate how an effective structural model can be formally extracted .",
    "the section after , discusses a phenomenological model for structural order .",
    "we then discuss our method and computational variables .",
    "this is followed by the results , first on ` ordering ' for materials of the form a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 , then for the ` doped ' cases , a@xmath0b@xmath5b@xmath6o@xmath1 , and finally for the ternary systems , a@xmath0bb@xmath2b@xmath3o@xmath1 .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "the magnetism in the dp s is intimately related to electron delocalisation , which in turn depends on the spatial pattern of b , b ions  @xcite .",
    "let us write down the hamiltonian in terms of the electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom to illustrate the crucial role of spatial b - b order .",
    "let b be the ` magnetic ' ion and b the non magnetic one .",
    "we define a binary variable @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 when a site has a b ion , and @xmath9 when a site has a b ion .",
    "the @xmath10 s will encode the atomic positions . in terms of these , the model for the dp s  is :    @xmath11    the @xmath12 operators refer to the magnetic b sites and the @xmath13 to the non magnetic b. @xmath14 and @xmath15 are level energies , respectively , at the b and b sites , @xmath16 is the ` charge transfer ' energy , and @xmath17 is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbour b and b ions .",
    "we have ignored orbital degeneracy in the present model . @xmath18",
    "are the moments on the b site , @xmath19 is the hunds coupling on those sites , and @xmath20 is the antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange coupling between b moments when two b ions neighbour each other .",
    "the @xmath21 represent atomic interactions between the b , b ions .    in the simplest case of equal proportions of b and b ions , and their perfect alternating arrangement , each b is coordinated by b only and vice versa .",
    "the af coupling does not come into play , and electron delocalisation on the b - b network generally prefers a ferromagnetic spin configuration .",
    "this state is also highly conducting .",
    "however , if the atomic order is imperfect and there are b ions neighbouring each other , two b moments get locked into an antiparallel configuration .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the overall ferromagnetic moment , and these ` antisite ' regions also hinder electron transport .",
    "the magnetism and transport is obviously strongly dependent on the structural motif .",
    "what decides the atomic b - b arrangement ?",
    "let us look at the formal answer first .    for large @xmath22 spins",
    ", the dp model refers to electrons coupled to classical magnetic moments and moving in a background defined by @xmath23 .",
    "if the atomic ordering problem is to be isolated from this , one should ` trace out ' the electronic and magnetic variables .",
    "the effective potential @xmath24 controlling atomic order is @xmath25 computing @xmath26 and ` updating ' atomic positions accordingly is a computationally demanding task , the monte carlo ( mc ) equivalent of a car - parinello simulation .",
    "there is limited information about @xmath27 , and the ` trace ' is technically difficult , so we construct a simple @xmath24 that is consistent with the phenomenology , rather than attempt an elaborate ` first principles ' calculation .",
    "we motivate this in the next section .",
    "the ideal dp with the general formula a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 has ordering of b and b atoms at the center of alternate o@xmath1 octahedra . focusing only on the b and b ions ,",
    "the ideal structure is simply an alternation of b and b ions along the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 axis .",
    "however , in imperfectly annealed systems , there can occur antisite defect regions where this ordering is reversed , and two b atoms or two b atoms occur adjacent to each other .",
    "the ordering of the b - b is in general neither ` perfect ' nor random , it is the result of an annealing process . while samples with high degree of order have been grown  @xcite , indicating that the atomic order in the structural ground state should be perfect , recent experiments reveal an interesting trend in the degree of order as a function of annealing temperature .    in the experiments by sarma _",
    "@xcite on sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 it was observed that there was a non - monotonic dependence of the degree of fe - mo ordering upon the annealing temperature , @xmath31 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the different samples were taken from the same ` parent ' material ( synthesised at high temperature and quenched to a low temperature ) , heated to a temperature @xmath31 , and annealed there for a duration @xmath32 , say .",
    "if there is indeed a b - b ordering tendency in the dp s , the extent of order _ at equilibrium _ would be highest at low @xmath31 , progressively falling off at higher @xmath31 where the order is expected to be small .",
    "the downturn at low annealing temperature , it seems reasonable , is due to insufficient equilibriation .",
    "our model below and results are based on the assumption that : ( i )  there is an intrinsic b - b ordering tendency in the dp s , ( ii )  given long equilibriation time , the dp s would indeed show a high degree of order at low @xmath33 , but ( iii )  under typical synthesis conditions / annealing protocol the system only manages to generate correlated configurations with short range order .",
    "the annealing temperature and annealing time are therefore key to quantifying the structural order .",
    "since the structural ( dis)order seems to be ` frozen ' at temperature , @xmath34k , much above the temperature for magnetic order ( @xmath35k ) , the qualitative issues in atomic ordering can be understood by ignoring the electronic - magnetic variables in an effective model , below .        in the absence of detailed microscopic knowledge about @xmath24 , we used a binary lattice gas model that has the same ordering tendency as the real materials , _ viz _ , b - b alternation , or equivalently a ` checkerboard ' pattern . in terms of the variables",
    "@xmath7 , the simplest such model is : @xmath36 with @xmath37 being a measure of the ordering tendency .",
    "the ground state in this model would correspond to @xmath38 along each axis , _",
    "i.e _ , b , b , b , b .. notice that this approach tries to incorporate the effect of complex interactions between the a , b , b and o ions ( as also the electrons ) into a single parameter ( see appendix ) .",
    "this binary model is equivalent to a nearest neighbour ising model , so the _ equilibrium physics _ is very well understood  @xcite .",
    "we , however , want to explore the consequences of different annealing protocols on this model , to examine the consequences of imperfect annealing .",
    "the qualitative ordering effects in the lattice gas model are similar in 2d and 3d , so we work with a 2d structure since it allows ease of visualisation .",
    "the atomic order that emerges from @xmath26 can be studied with mean field theory if the system is in equilibrium .",
    "however , we want to explore non equilibrium effects due to poor annealing , so we use a monte carlo technique to anneal the @xmath10 variables .",
    "most of our studies involve a protocol where we start with a completely random b - b configuration ( as if quenched from very high @xmath33 ) , and then anneal it at a temperature @xmath31 , for a mc run of duration @xmath32 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) .",
    "since the number of b and b atoms is fixed we update our configurations by ( i )  moving to some site @xmath39 , ( ii )  attempting an _ exchange _ of the atom at @xmath39 , with another randomly picked within a box of size @xmath40 centred on @xmath39 , and ( iii )  accepting or rejecting the move based on the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we have used system size @xmath41 and @xmath42 , update cluster with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 ranging from @xmath46 , and @xmath47 mcs .",
    "we have studied the structure factor , and also detailed spatial configurations , to quantify the extent of order .",
    "this section discusses the order in systems where the number of b and b ions is equal , and perfect order is in principle possible . in an attempt to mimic the experimental annealing protocol",

    "the extent of order , quantified by the peak in @xmath48 , is shown in fig.2(a ) for a lattice size @xmath50 , and in fig.2(b ) , for a lattice size @xmath51 .",
    "there are two noteworthy features in the data in fig.2 .",
    "( i )  the non monotonic behaviour with @xmath31 that we anticipated indeed shows up in the structure factor peak , and ( ii )  there is a strong size dependence of the peak in @xmath52 , varying almost by a factor of 4 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 !",

    ", however , this is suppressed to @xmath60 of the equilibrium value , for the same mcs .",
    "this origin of this strong size dependence becomes apparent when we examine a typical configuration at low @xmath31 , generated by a short annealing run , @xmath61 mcs , in fig.3    the ordering is obviously imperfect , as @xmath62 suggested , more interestingly , the system actually consists of a few large ordered clusters with ` phase slip ' between them . while locally these domains are well ordered , the bulk @xmath62 arises from the interfering contribution of large domains , and this ` cancellation ' depends strongly on the system size @xmath57 . in the smaller systems , @xmath63 , @xmath62",

    "<S> we formulate an effective model for b - b site ordering in double perovskite materials a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 . even within the simple framework of lattice - gas type models , we are able to address several experimentally observed issues including nonmonotonic dependence of the degree of order on annealing temperature , and the rapid decrease of order upon overdoping with either b or b species . </S>",
    "<S> we also study ordering in the ` ternary ' compounds a@xmath0bb@xmath2b@xmath3o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> although our emphasis is on the double perovskites , our results are easily generalizable to a wide variety of binary and ternary alloys . </S>"
