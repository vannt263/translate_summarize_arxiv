    "the bending of light in a gravitational field predicted by general relativity provided one of the first verifications of einstein theory @xcite .",
    "the value of the deflection angle which results has now been tested at the 1% level by observing the change in the apparent position of stars whose light is deflected by the sun . in 1920",
    ", eddington @xcite noted that the light deflection by a stellar object would lead to a secondary dimmer image of a source star on the opposite side of the deflector .",
    "chwolson @xcite later pointed out that these secondary images could make foreground stars appear as binaries , and that if the alignment were perfect , the image of the source would be a ring . in 1936",
    ", einstein @xcite published the correct formula for the magnification of the two images of a very distant star , and concluded that this lensing effect was of no practical relevance due to the unresolvably small angular separation of the images and the low probability for a high amplification event to take place .",
    "the following year , zwicky @xcite showed that , if the deflecting object were a galaxy instead of a single star , the gravitational lensing of the light of a background galaxy would lead to resolvable images .",
    "this ` macrolensing ' effect would provide information about the mass of the intervening galaxy and allow observation of objects at much larger distances due to the magnification of their light .",
    "furthermore , the probability that this effect be observed is a ` certainty ' @xcite .",
    "it was actually the multiple imaging of a high redshift quasar by a foreground galaxy which provided the first observation of gravitational lensing @xcite , and this area of research has now become an active field in astronomy , with the potential of giving crucial information for cosmology @xcite .",
    "for instance , the time delay among the multiple images of a quasar allows one to relate the lens mass to the hubble constant .",
    "another interesting example is that the mass distribution of a rich cluster can be reconstructed from the shapes of the images of thousands of background faint blue galaxies around it , which become elongated due to the effect of weak lensing by the cluster @xcite .",
    "also , gravitational lensing can strongly affect the observable properties of agn and quasars , and may have to be taken into account when inferring their intrinsic properties .    while these developments were going on , the theoretical study of gravitational lensing of stars by stars restarted in 1964 , with the work of liebes @xcite and refsdal @xcite , who extended the formalism and discussed the lensing of stars in the disk of the galaxy , in globular clusters and in the andromeda galaxy .",
    "the lensing effect of individual stars belonging to a galaxy that is itself macrolensing a background source was discussed by chang and refsdal @xcite .",
    "when both the lensed source and the intervening galaxy are at cosmological distances , the passage of one of these stars close to the line of sight to one of the images further deflects the source light by an angle which is typically of @xmath0arcsec ) .",
    "the name ` microlensing ' ( ml ) then became associated with this process , and is now generally applied to any gravitational lensing effect by a compact object producing unresolvable images of a source and potentially huge magnifications of its light .",
    "press and gunn @xcite showed in 1973 that a cosmological density of massive compact dark objects could manifest through the ml of high redshift sources . in 1981 , gott @xcite pointed out the possibility of detecting the dark halos of remote galaxies by looking for ml of background quasars .",
    "it was in 1986 that paczyski @xcite gave a new face to the field when he noted that , by monitoring the light",
    " curves of millions of stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) for more than a year , it would become possible to test whether the halo of our galaxy consisted of compact objects with masses between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. covering most of the range where baryonic dark matter in the form of planets , jupiters , brown dwarfs or stellar remnants ( dead stars , neutron stars or black holes ) could lie .",
    "it was later realized @xcite that the galactic bulge stars also provided an interesting target to look at , since at least the lensing by faint stars in the disk should grant the observation of ml events , and observations in the bulge could also allow one to test the dark constituency of the galaxy close to the galactic plane .    with these motivations",
    ", several groups undertook the observations towards the lmc ( eros and macho collaborations ) and towards the bulge ( macho and ogle ) , obtaining the first harvest of ml events in 1993 @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed in this review , the observations at present are already providing crucial insights into the dark matter problem , into the non  luminous contribution to the mass of the different galactic components and they are helping to unravel the morphology of the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "the continuation of these programs , as well as the new ones entering the scene ( duo collaboration looking towards the bulge ; agape and the columbia ",
    "vatt collaborations looking at andromeda and followup telescope networks such as planet , gman and moa looking for fine details in the microlensing events ) will certainly allow us to reach a much deeper knowledge of these fundamental issues in the near future .",
    "in order to study the lensing effects of objects in and around the galaxy , it is first convenient to discuss the nature of the several possible lens candidates as well as their distribution and expected properties . in this section",
    "we briefly introduce the different galactic components @xcite and the possible lensing populations present in them .",
    "the existence of dark galactic halos is directly related to the dark matter ( dm ) issue @xcite , namely the fact that more than 90% , and probably even 99% , of the matter in the universe does not seem to emit any electromagnetic radiation .",
    "its existence has been inferred from the gravitational effects that it has on the observed motions of gas , stars , galaxies and clusters , and also from its effects on the overall geometry of space  time .",
    "for instance , the velocity dispersions of galaxies in clusters indicate that cluster masses are more than 10 times larger than the mass contained in the luminous parts of its constituent galaxies and in the intra",
    " cluster gas @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained from the x  ray observations of the cluster gas temperature profiles @xcite as well as from weak gravitational lensing @xcite . at galactic scales , the presence of dm is most clearly indicated by the flatness of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite , and also from the motion of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of dark halos surrounding the visible galaxies is supposed to account , at least in part , for this missing mass ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the halo densities are then required to fall as @xmath3 with the galactocentric distance @xmath4 , as long as the rotation curves stay flat .",
    "a parameterization usually adopted for the density of a spherically symmetric halo is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the halo core radius , typically a few kpc . for our galaxy ,",
    "taking @xmath7 as the solar galactocentric distance , we have that in eq .",
    "( [ rhoh.eq ] ) @xmath8 is the local halo density . in the following",
    "we will adopt @xmath9  kpc and we will take the reference value @xmath10pc@xmath11 @xcite .    if we assume that the milky way circular speed @xmath12  km / s stays constant up to a galactocentric distance @xmath13 , the total mass of the galaxy within that radius results (",
    "@xmath14 is newton s constant ) @xmath15 which is an order of magnitude larger than the disk mass if @xmath16  kpc , and hence should mainly be due to the halo .",
    "the large amounts of matter contained in the dark galactic halos may account for the missing mass in clusters as well .",
    "the detailed profile and extent of galactic halos , in particular that of the milky way , are however not well known , partly due to the poor knowledge of the rotation curves . for our galaxy",
    ", the rotation curve has been measured only up to @xmath17 kpc and with large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "there is also an uncertainty affecting the halo density in the inner region of the galaxy which is related to the imprecise knowledge of the contribution to the rotation curve coming from the galactic disk .",
    "for instance , maximum disk models @xcite would lead to little halo mass inside the solar galactocentric radius .",
    "another poorly constrained property of halos is their ellipticity @xcite which , for instance , in simulations of galaxy formation with cold dark matter turns out to be non  negligible .",
    "observations of polar ring galaxies , in which the motion of gas in a ring orthogonal to the plane of the disk can constrain the flattening of the mass distribution , have also provided some examples of flattened halos .",
    "however , the flaring of hi in the outskirts of the disks in spiral galaxies indicates that the halo is not distributed as a thin disk @xcite .",
    "a further complication is that a flattened halo may not be axisymmetric and may also be tilted with respect to the disk plane .",
    "associated with all these uncertainties there is also an uncertainty in the motion of the halo constituents .",
    "the simplest hypothesis that is usually adopted is that the halo objects move with isotropic velocities , which have a maxwellian distribution with constant ( space independent ) one  dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath18 , which is then related to the circular speed by @xmath19  km / s .",
    "this so  called isothermal sphere is known to lead to a density profile falling as @xmath3 at large radii .",
    "a self  consistent halo distribution , not including the effects of the disk but allowing for an elliptical halo as well as for a rising or declining rotation curve , has been obtained in ref .",
    "some progress towards including the dynamical effects of disks and bulges has also recently been made @xcite .",
    "the nature of the dark halo constituents is one of the important open problems of present ",
    "day physics .",
    "one possibility is that they are composed of just ordinary baryonic matter , e.g. protons and neutrons .",
    "a very important bound for the total amount of baryons in the universe comes from the agreement between the observed abundances of light elements ( d , @xmath11he , @xmath20he , @xmath21li ) and those predicted in the context of the primordial nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "this requires that the average density of baryons @xmath22 , in terms of the critical density of the universe @xmath23 is the density leading to a flat universe , with @xmath24 being the hubble constant .",
    "] , @xmath25 , be in the range @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "since luminous matter accounts for @xmath27 @xcite , the lower bound on @xmath28 suggests the existence of baryonic matter in dark forms .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath28 is consistent with dark baryonic halos accounting for the observations at galactic scales , which require @xmath29 .",
    "however , when combined with observations on cluster scales or larger @xcite , which imply that @xmath300.3 ( and probably @xmath31 , which is the value preferred by inflationary theories ) , the above mentioned upper bound , @xmath32 , suggests the existence of non  baryonic dark matter ( nbdm ) .",
    "an additional attractive feature of nbdm is that it proves very useful in allowing for the formation of structure , in scenarios where the inhomogeneities in the density grow first in the nbdm , with the baryons falling later into the dark potential wells . in these scenarios , the nbdm that seeded galaxy formation",
    "is expected to remain somewhere in the galaxies , with the halo being the most ` natural ' place .",
    "candidates for nbdm abound in the literature , going from primordial black holes ( made essentially out of radiation ) to elementary particles such as massive neutrinos , axions , supersymmetric neutralinos , etc ..    on the other hand , as mentioned above , halos may well be baryonic and there are actually many ways in which baryons can hide in dark forms , without entering into conflict with other observations ( for a review see ref .",
    "these are :    * very massive black holes ( with mass @xmath33 , in order to avoid the ejection of too many heavy elements into the interstellar medium ) . * stellar remnants , such as neutron stars or dead white dwarfs ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "* brown dwarfs , which are stars made essentially of h and he that are too light to start efficient nuclear fusion reactions ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the minimum star mass for h burning to take place ) . the jeans mass , i.e. the minimum mass for which the gravitational forces of an isolated gas cloud fragment can overcome the pressure forces and lead to star formation , has been estimated to be 4@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "under special conditions ( e.g. in protoplanetary disks ) , this lower bound can be evaded .",
    "hydrogenous objects with masses in the neighbourhood of @xmath38 are usually named jupiters .",
    "* snowballs , which are compact objects with masses below @xmath38 , held together by molecular , rather than gravitational , forces . a lower bound of @xmath39 for their masses has been suggested in order to avoid their evaporation @xcite .",
    "* clouds of molecular h have been proposed as baryonic constituents of the dark galactic halos @xcite .    these possibilities , with the exception of the last one ,",
    "clearly provide excellent candidates for gravitational lenses .",
    "these objects are sometimes generically called massive compact halo objects ( machos ) . of course nothing",
    "is known about the mass function of the halo constituents , except that the number of ordinary main sequence stars ( see section  6.3 ) and of white dwarf remnants @xcite should be quite suppressed .",
    "most of the visible stars in our galaxy are distributed in a disk , generally assumed to be a double exponential in the galactocentric cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the local disk density , @xmath43  kpc is the disk scale length @xcite ( estimates of @xmath44 vary however in the wide range from 1.8 to 6  kpc @xcite ) and @xmath45 is the scale height , which is @xmath46100  pc for the very young stars and gas , and @xmath46325  pc for the older disk stars @xcite . there are some indications @xcite that at distances larger than @xmath47  kpc towards the galactic center the disk star density falls below what would follow from eq .",

    "( [ rhod.eq ] ) does not describe the existence of a spiral structure , which is probably responsible for an excess in the star counts at distances @xmath51  kpc from the sun ( sagitarius arm ) in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "the disk is supported by the rotation of its stars , @xmath52  km / s .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath53 of disk stars is small : @xmath54  km / s locally , although it is probably larger at smaller @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the existence of a somewhat hotter component , the thick disk , was suggested by gilmore and reid @xcite .",
    "this component has velocity dispersion @xmath55  km / s , slower rotation ( @xmath56 , with the asymmetric drift being @xmath57  km / s ) and larger scale height , @xmath58  kpc @xcite .",
    "while the ` thin ' disk is made of relatively young metal rich stars , the thick disk stars have smaller metallicities , and so are probably older .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the thick disk is just the old tail of the thin disk or is instead a separate component formed independently .",
    "the thin disk local column density , @xmath59 , has been measured in several ways .",
    "bahcall @xcite initially obtained for the observed matter @xmath60pc@xmath61 , with @xmath62pc@xmath61 in gas , @xmath63pc@xmath61 in white dwarfs and red giant stars and the rest in main sequence stars .",
    "a more recent analysis @xcite finds a smaller m dwarf contribution , leading to @xmath64/pc@xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "kuijken and gilmore @xcite obtain , from the study of the vertical motion of stars , that the total ( disk+halo ) column density within @xmath65  kpc of the disk plane is @xmath66  kpc@xmath67pc@xmath61 .",
    "removing the halo contribution with a rotation curve constraint they obtain , for the disk alone , @xmath68",
    "a reanalysis by gould of the same data lead to @xmath70  kpc@xmath71pc@xmath61 @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "this does not suggest the presence of large amounts of dm in the disk .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that the local mass distribution of main sequence stars @xcite has been measured almost down to the hydrogen burning limit , and it is consistent with being approximately flat below @xmath72 , so that a naive extrapolation of it below @xmath36 does not hint towards a significant contribution to the disk mass coming from the brown dwarfs .",
    "if we take as an upper limit for the disk column density within @xmath65  kpc the value 70@xmath73/pc@xmath61 , and subtract from it the column density of known matter , this would allow a maximum dark contribution to the thin disk density of @xmath74/pc@xmath61 . for the thick disk , @xmath75/pc@xmath61 may be allowed , since for a distribution with scale height @xmath76  kpc only 2/3 of the total column density would be within those heights .",
    "finally , let us note that the total mass associated with the disk , in terms of the local column density @xmath77 and assuming the scale length to be 3.5  kpc , is ( upon integration of eq .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the other population of stars , which is observed both looking at high latitudes far above the disk and locally by studying the high velocity stars which can not be bound to the disk , is the galactic spheroid ( sometimes referred to by astronomers as the ` stellar halo ' ) .",
    "it is a population of old metal poor stars , probably of protogalactic origin , with little rotation , supported by a large velocity dispersion @xmath79  km / s and density falling as @xmath80 .",

    "there may however be departures from sphericity in the spheroid density and from isotropy in the velocity distributions @xcite .",

    "if we assume for a moment that all the lenses have the same mass @xmath126 , this probability is just the number of lenses inside a tube of radius @xmath146 around the l.o.s . to the star , assumed to be at a distance @xmath176 .",
    "the number of objects inside this ` microlensing tube ' is @xmath177 since this expression turns out to be independent of the assumed lens mass , it actually holds also for any arbitrary lens mass distribution .",
    "when performing observations in a given direction , one may have to take into account , especially for bulge observations , that the sources can be distributed with a non  negligible spread along the l.o.s .. in this case , one has to perform an average over the source distribution @xcite to obtain the actual optical depth @xmath178 where the normalization factor is @xmath179 and @xmath180 describes the number density profile of detectable sources along the l.o.s .. for observations in the bulge , it can be parameterised as @xmath181 .",
    "the factor @xmath182 is due to the change of the volume element with distance . the parameter @xmath135 arises because the observations are magnitude limited , and the fraction of sources with luminosities larger than @xmath183 is assumed to scale as @xmath184 , implying that the fraction of stars which remain detectable behave as @xmath185 .",
    "hence , @xmath186 a reasonable range for @xmath135 has been estimated to be @xmath187 in baade s window @xcite , and we will generally use @xmath188 in the discussion of ml in the bulge .",
    "due to its simplicity and the property of being independent of the lens motion and mass distribution , the optical depth is often used in discussions of the ml observations . however , since the experiments measure the number of events and their durations , a more useful quantity is the ml rate , and in particular its distribution as a function of the event durations .",

    "the computation of the optical depth for bulge stars , lensed by low mass stars in the bulge and disk , also leads to @xmath271 , with typical event durations of a few weeks ( see below ) , so that in this case also several million stars need to be monitored for more than a year to get significant statistics .",
    "in addition to the small number of expected events , a further complication is that there is a large background of variable stars , and special care should be taken in order to avoid including one of these stars as an ml event .",
    "variable stars represent a fraction @xmath272 of the total number of stars , and an interesting byproduct of the ml searches has been the compilation of the more complete catalogs of variables in the lmc @xcite and in baade s window @xcite .",
    "there are many signatures which allow one to distinguish between intrinsic stellar variabilities and ml events , so that one can be confident that a real signal of ml is found :    * most variables are periodic , while due to the very small probability for a star to be lensed , ml events should never repeat for the same star . *",

    "however , one should keep in mind that the mass function of the two lens populations , i.e. the disk and bulge stars , need not be similar , and this further complicates the interpretation of the observations .",
    "in section 3.1 we have obtained the expected magnification of the source star luminosity during an ml event in the approximation that the source is point  like and that the lens has a uniform motion with respect to the ml tube . in this case , all of the information about the physical parameters of the lens is contained in the event duration @xmath173 , which depends on the mass @xmath126 , the distance to the observer @xmath299 , the relative velocity in the plane orthogonal to the l.o.s . , @xmath165 , as well as on the distance to the source , which is sometimes ( e.g. in bulge observations ) not very well constrained .",

    "now that the ` early warning ' systems @xcite have shown the ability of detecting the lensing events in real time , while the magnification of the source is starting , the strategy would be to monitor several million stars from the ground and to follow with the satellite telescope those sources that have been singled out by the early warning system as possible ml candidates .",
    "obtaining @xmath329 and @xmath324 for a large fraction of the observed ml events would allow a better characterization of the lensing population and , hopefully , distinguish among some of the proposed scenarios .",
    "for example , for observations towards the lmc , it would be possible to distinguish between lenses in the galaxy and lenses in the lmc .",
    "the measurement of very large values of @xmath330 would be evidence of lenses belonging to the lmc , for which it is expected that @xmath331 1000 km / s , while significantly smaller values would result from galactic lenses , for which @xmath332 .",
    "furthermore , in this last case , parallax measurements would provide direct information on the velocity distribution of the lenses , helping to distinguish between disk , spheroid and halo lenses .    for observations towards the galactic bulge",
    ", the reduced velocity measurements would also be very helpful for distinguishing between disk and bulge lenses @xcite .",
    "typical disk lenses are located half  way to the bulge , thus the reduced velocity is approximately twice the velocity of the lens with respect to the ml tube .",
    "furthermore , the flat rotation curve of the disk and the relatively small velocity dispersion of disk stars gives an approximate relation between @xmath333 and the lens distance ( neglecting the motion of the source ) , @xmath334 , where for bulge star sources @xmath335 .",
    "thus , for a population of disk lenses , the reduced velocities are expected to be @xmath336 , and hence to be close to 200 km / s . on the other hand , a large enhacement factor for @xmath337 with respect to @xmath165",
    "is expected for bulge lenses , as these would be located close to the source stars .",
    "velocity dispersions of bulge stars of the order of 100 km / s give rise to reduced velocities peaked at @xmath338 km / s .",
    "thus , for a large fraction of the events , it would be possible to determine whether they are due to disk or bulge lenses , and for events due to disk lenses , to obtain the most probable lens distance , which in turn helps to better constrain the lens masses .",
    "if the time duration and reduced velocity are known for a given event , the mass and distance of the lens are related through @xmath339    parallax effects can be measured from the earth only for very long duration events , for which the motion of the earth gives rise to a significant correction to the light ",
    "an event of this kind has already been detected by the macho collaboration in their first season of bulge observations @xcite .",
    "their longest event , lasting 110  days , presents a significantly asymmetric , but still achromatic , light  curve , as is expected to be the case when the approximation of constant velocities of the lens , source and observer does not hold .",
    "the correction for the orbital motion of the earth significantly improves the fit to the observed light ",

    "the best fitting values obtained for the lens parameters are @xmath342 kpc and @xmath343 , indicating that the lens is probably an old white dwarf or a neutron star in the disk would be larger , and hence the lens mass smaller @xcite . ] .",
    "hence , the observation of parallax in one event allows one to achieve a better knowledge of the lens characteristics than in the rest of the events .",

    "for some particular ml events it may become possible to obtain information on the einstein angle @xmath344 defined by @xmath345 and hence know the ` proper motion ' @xmath346 which is just the angular velocity of the lens relative to the source .",
    "notice that the proper motion is a kinematical variable , independent of the lens mass , while @xmath344 is independent of the lens velocity , and hence these parameters are less convoluted than the event duration @xmath173 .",
    "the clearest situation in which the proper motion can be measured is when the radial extension of the source @xmath347 projected onto the lens plane is comparable to the impact parameter of the lens trajectory @xmath162 , or equivalently that the angle subtended by @xmath347 , @xmath348 , is larger than the angle subtended by @xmath162 , @xmath349 ( see fig .",
    "[ angles.fig ] ) . in this case , the point  like source approximation breaks down , and the light  curve of the ml event is modified allowing the proper motion of the lens to be extracted from it @xcite .",
    "one proper motion has been recently measured by the macho collaboration in a bulge star @xcite .",
    "the magnification of a circular source with uniform surface brightness lensed by a point  like mass has been obtained by witt and mao @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . if @xmath350 , the light ",

    "maoz and gould @xcite proposed exploiting the fact that , during the lensing of an extended rotating source , the differential amplification of the source disk induces a shift in the spectral lines .",
    "spectroscopic observations whith a large telescope can detect the time shift of the spectral lines and the proper motion of the lens can then be determined .",

    "the centroid trajectory follows an ellipse whose size is proportional to the einstein angular radius @xmath344 , and for large amplification events the maximum centroid deflection is @xmath367 . in order to observe this small effect , a satellite experiment with a 1  m telescope and very high accuracy in the photometry",
    "would be required . finally , using the next generation of optical interferometers , it may become feasible to measure by direct imaging the einstein angles of some of the long duration events ( corresponding to massive lenses ) towards the bulge .",
    "let us note that if , in addition to the proper motion , also the reduced velocity is measured for the same event using parallax , then the three parameters @xmath299 , @xmath126 and @xmath165 can be determined .      up to now",

    "the fraction of genuinely binary events depends on the stellar type considered and , for example , for giant sources it is not expected that a companion star would be bright enough to significantly affect the light  curve .",

    "they also showed that the minimum amplification for a source inside the caustic is @xmath398 .",

    "the fact that the light  curve is very steep when the limb of the source touches the caustic allows a quite precise determination of the location of the source with respect to the caustic .",

    "the angular einstein ring radius divided by the total lens mass , @xmath420 , can be determined . since a detailed measurement of the caustic crossing",

    "finally , another method for extracting information about the lens parameters for an ordinary ml event , in the case in which both the lens and the source are main  sequence stars , has been proposed by kamionkowski @xcite .",
    "if the light from the lens contributes significantly to the observed brightness and it has a different color from the source light , it is expected that for some of the events a shift in the color can be measured . in this case",
    ", it would be possible to infer the lens and source colors and luminosities , and hence the lens mass and the distances to the source and the lens if they are main  sequence stars .",
    "using then the event duration one may determine the lens velocity .",
    "however , it would be difficult to be sure that the blending in the light is due to light from the lens rather than from another unresolved source .",
    "a discussion of the effects of blending in ml searches can be found in ref .",
    "in this section we discuss the method of searching for ml of unresolved stars which is being applied to ml searches in the andromeda galaxy .",
    "we also discuss the constraints on the number of red and brown dwarfs in the galaxy , which can be obtained with ir searches and which give important information , complementary to that obtained with ml searches , about the possible galactic lensing populations .",
    "the standard microlensing technique discussed so far consists of monitoring the light flux from a large number of stars , looking for magnifications consistent with the ml event characteritics .",
    "this is the method used by the ongoing searches towards the magellanic clouds ( macho and eros ) and the galactic bulge ( ogle , macho and duo ) .",
    "while this kind of search has led to spectacular results , it has the restriction that it can only be applied to targets where several million stars can be resolved .    a different approach has been proposed by baillon et al .",
    "@xcite and by crotts @xcite , which consists in the search for ml of unresolved stars .",
    "the idea is to study the flux of light received by every ccd pixel in the picture of a galaxy , rather than the flux of the individual stars .",
    "this allows one to detect the amplification due to the lensing of one of the many stars present in a crowded field , even if the star is not resolved . the number of stars effectively monitored is greatly enlarged with this method .",
    "however , ml events are harder to detect since the light of each star contributes only a small fraction of the light in a pixel .",
    "thus , only lensing of bright stars or very small impact parameter ( high amplification ) events in the lensing of fainter stars can be detected .",
    "it has been proposed that this method , applied to lmc searches , would give an order of magnitude more events than the standard technique @xcite .",
    "however , the main advantage of the pixel lensing method is that it allows one to look for ml events in more distant galaxies , where the standard lensing technique is not applicable due to the crowding limit .",
    "an interesting target for this kind of search is the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) @xcite , which is located at a distance of @xmath421  kpc from us .",
    "these observations are not only sensitive to ml by compact objects in the milky way , but also to those in andromeda itself",
    ". observations towards m87 in the virgo cluster may be sensitive to intra  cluster dark matter also @xcite .",
    "the theory and observational prospects for pixel lensing searches have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ; we present here a brief discussion .",
    "the basic idea of the method is that if a star of flux @xmath422 is lensed in a crowded field , by subtracting from the actual images of the field a reference one ( obtained by averaging several images taken before or after the event ) , one should get just a stellar image with flux equal to @xmath423 on top of the photon noise .",
    "the extent of the star image is fixed by the point spread function ( psf ) , determined in turn by the actual seeing conditions .",
    "if we denote by @xmath424 the effective solid angle associated with the spread in the star image , and by @xmath425 the background flux per unit solid angle coming from the sky and from the galaxy light in the region where the ml event is taking place , the signal to noise of the ml observation in an exposure time @xmath426 is just @xmath427 for a required value of @xmath428 , there is thus a minimum amplification @xmath429 , which depends on @xmath422 , for the event to be detected .",
    "the strategy adopted , for instance , by the agape group is to study the light ",
    "curve of superpixels , i.e. groups of pixels chosen so as to approximately match the psf of the stellar images , and look for consecutive increments of the signal significantly above the noise to identify a stellar variability .",
    "one may also trigger on the signal to noise of the whole event , as advocated in @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , sources of fluctuations which have to be controlled for a successful observation .",
    "these include the limited precision in the telescope pointing ( which requires a geometric realignment of the images ) , the changes in the background sky light and in the transparency of the atmosphere ( requiring a photometric realignment of the images ) and finally , to eventually convolve the reference image with the actual seeing conditions .",
    "some techniques have been developed to correct for these effects @xcite , and it is expected that they can be kept smaller than the statistical fluctuations in the number of photons .    as for the standard ml searches ,",
    "the main background for lensing events of unresolved stars is given by variable stars .",
    "the criteria to distinguish them are also the symmetric shape of the light  curve and the non repetition of the ml event . also the achromaticity signature can be used @xcite : even if the lensing of a star will cause a color variation in the pixels involved , the ratio of the increment in the flux from the reference flux in two different colors @xmath430 is constant in time during an ml event .",
    "another point which has to be taken into account in ml searches in distant galaxies is that the effect of the finite size of the source gives rise to a maximum amplification , given by eq .",
    "( [ amax ] ) , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "thus , for sources of a given radius @xmath431 , there is a minimum lens mass giving rise to an observable event @xmath432 where @xmath429 is the threshold amplification associated to a given @xmath428 requirement .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the number of detectable lensing events of red giant sources and the efficiency for lensing by very light objects in m31 @xcite .",
    "using monte carlo simulations and semi  analytic computations , baillon et al .",
    "@xcite estimated that in searches towards m31 the best sensitivity is achieved for lens masses in the range @xmath433@xmath434 , that most of the detectable events correspond to mild amplifications of bright stars rather than high amplifications of faint ones , and that feasible observation programs would lead to a few tens of events per year for brown dwarf masses in the range @xmath435 to @xmath436 making up the halos of the milky way and m31 .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in ref .",

    ". moreover , the dark constituency of m31 itself can be probed , and the fact that we see the disk of m31 with a high inclination ( @xmath438 respect to the face on position ) gives rise , for lenses in m31 , to a much larger optical depth for ml of sources in the far side of the disk than for those in the near side @xcite .",

    "if observations at different distances are performed , they would clearly yield valuable information about the distribution of the lenses .",
    "there are other observations which can be helpful for identifying the lensing population . if the dark objects responsible for ml are in the form of low mass red dwarfs ( @xmath449@xmath450 ) , which are very faint and emit mostly in the ir , or of brown dwarfs , _",

    "the most promising brown dwarf signal comes from individual stars in the solar vicinity , while the collective emission from galactic or extra ",
    "galactic brown dwarf distributions is generally less important .    assuming that brown dwarfs emit black body radiation , the peak flux of the nearest brown dwarf of a population with local density @xmath451 is @xcite @xmath452 here @xmath126 , @xmath174 , and @xmath453 are respectively the mass , age and opacity of the nearest brown dwarf ( @xmath454erg cm@xmath292s@xmath456hz@xmath456 ) .",

    "another study by bahcall et al .",
    "@xcite of two long exposures of a high latitude field taken with the wide field camera on the hubble space telescope , also constrains the local density of red dwarfs .",

    "the contribution of main  sequence stars with @xmath479 to the dark halo is constrained to be less than 6% .",
    "a reanalysis of this same data by graff and freese @xcite , using new stellar models and parallax measurements of low mass , low metallicity stars , tightens this last bound to be less than 1% of the halo density .",
    "this means that if a significant fraction of the galactic halo consists of a population of brown and red dwarfs , then their mass function has to cut off very sharply above @xmath480 .",
    "the idea of using ml to study the dark constituents of our galaxy has proved to be extremely useful . in the last few years",
    ", several experiments started searches for ml and many surprises have resulted .    the observations in the direction of the lmc returned rates which are significantly smaller than those expected from a standard halo composed of objects with masses in the range @xmath267@xmath257 , but anyway larger than those expected from the faint stars present in the known stellar populations , so that something new has certainly been found .",
    "if the compact objects belong to the halo , these results could imply that the halo has a large fraction of heavy objects ( @xmath481 ) , or a lot of gas , or is a mixture with non  baryonic dark matter , or alternatively that it deviates significantly from the standard halo models due , for instance , to the disk being close to maximal and the rotation curve actually falling with distance . another plausible explanation is that a large number of brown dwarfs and/or stellar remnants is present either in the galactic spheroid or in a thick disk , with the halo being allowed to be completely non  baryonic . increased statistics will clearly allow these facts to be put on a more solid basis and to discriminate between the different proposed solutions . continuing the observations",
    "will also allow one to gain sensitivity to longer event durations , i.e. to heavier lens masses .",
    "observations towards the bulge returned on the contrary more events than were initially expected , implying that probably the bar in the inner galaxy was rediscovered using ml .",
    "continued searches will allow one to further constrain the geometry and mass of this galactic component .",
    "the rates observed may also be indicative of large amounts of material in the disk , and this could also hint towards a smaller contribution of the halo to the rotation curve , so that bulge results may also be relevant for lmc searches . the large number of events observed has allowed identification of some particularly interesting cases of ml , such as events due to binary lenses and the observation of parallax due to the earth s motion .",
    "more events of these types , as well as proper motion measurements in the lensing of giant stars , will allow better identification of the lensing agents .",
    "also the mapping of the rates and event durations across the bulge are crucial for isolating the different contributions from disk and bulge lens and source populations .    hence , microlensing has opened a new window for galactic astronomy , allowing one to ` see ' dark objects which are otherwise unobservable .",
    "the first results already had an important impact on our understanding of galactic structure and of the composition of the dark halo , which still remains one of the fundamental open problems in physics .",
    "this field is rapidly moving , with new experiments joining the searches , so that one can expect that a deeper , and better established , knowledge of these fundamental issues , and possibly some new surprises , will be obtained in the near future .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank gian f. giudice and alvaro de rjula for all the work done in collaboration in this subject .",
    "we thank andy gould for a careful reading of the manuscript and useful suggestions .",
    "we also thank d. bennett , a. udalski and j. rich for allowing us to use the figures with the results of their experiments , and j. kaplan , j. miller and a. milztajn for comments .",
    "just after completing this review , the first new ` surprising ' ml result was announced by the macho collaboration .",
    "they presented their preliminary results from the analysis of the second year of lmc data as well as a reanalysis of the first year data , exploiting the experience gained with the large number of ml events observed towards the bulge .",
    "they realized that many of the bulge events would not have been identified with the cuts employed in the initial analysis of the first year of lmc data , and hence used a different search strategy in the new analysis .",
    "the results were :    _ i ) _ of the three events found initially @xcite , only one remained as a ` true ' ml event , the one shown in figure [ gold.fig ] .",
    "of the other two , which were low signal events , one had other bumps in the light ",
    "curve during the second year , being shown then to be just a variable , and the other one did not pass the new cuts .",
    "however , the star sample was enlarged by 15% in the reanalysis of the first year data , and with the new cuts two new events appeared during this period .",
    "_ ii ) _ regarding the second year , five candidate events were found , one of which is slightly asymmetric , and hence not completely reliable .",
    "another of these events is due to a binary lens , and it was possible to measure the proper motion during one of the caustic crossings .",
    "the small value of this quantity ( @xmath482  km / s / kpc ) suggests that the lens belongs to the lmc . on the other hand , for the accumulated statistics",
    ", about one event was expected due to lmc stars acting as lenses , and the binary event appeared just in a star in the lmc bar , while most of the remaining events are in stars outside the bar , and hence are less likely to be due to lmc lenses .    _",
    "iii ) _ another important fact is that the durations of all the new events are longer ( 23  d to 72  d ) than those found initially in the first year analysis , implying that the inferred lens masses ( @xmath483@xmath484 ) are larger than initially suggested .    _",
    "iv ) _ a preliminary estimate of the optical depth from the eight events is @xmath485 , while removing the asymmetric event and the binary lens one ( since the lens belongs to the lmc ) , leads to an estimated @xmath486 for the optical depth due to the lenses which could be galactic .    _",
