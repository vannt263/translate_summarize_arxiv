    "to explain the cameron band emission in comet 103p / hartley  2 , @xcite considered five possible production mechanisms of co(a@xmath3 ) molecule .",
    "the modelled cameron band emission of co molecule by @xcite suggested that 60% of total co(a@xmath3 ) production can be through photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 ; the remaining was attributed to other excitation processes .",

    "there are several observations of co in comet 1p / halley , as well as in other comets , which suggest that co is produced directly from the nucleus as well as having prevailed distributed sources in the cometary coma @xcite .",

    "the rate of photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 molecule into co(a@xmath3 ) mainly depends on the degradation of solar flux in the wavelength region 8501050  .",
