    "the extra spatial dimensions ( large @xcite , warped @xcite or hyperbolic @xcite ) have proven useful in solving the gauge hierarchy problem within the quantum gravitational framework . in particular , large extra dimensions induce newton s constant in four dimensions from @xmath2 scale einstein gravity via the large volume of the extra space .",
    "the basic setup of this scenario @xmath3 arkani - hamed ",
    "dvali ( add ) scenario @xcite , is that @xmath4dimensional universe we live in is a field - theoretic brane @xcite which traps all flavors of matter except the sm singlets @xmath5 the graviton and right - handed neutrinos .",
    "as long as the surface tension of the brane does not exceed the fundamental scale @xmath6 of @xmath7dimensional gravity , at distances @xmath8 the spacetime metric @xmath9 remains essentially flat .",
    "in other words , for singlet emissions ( from brane ) with transverse ( to brane ) momenta @xmath10 the background spacetime is basically minkowski .",
    "therefore , it is admissible to expand @xmath7dimensional metric about the flat background @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are perturbations .",
    "the gravitational sector is described by the einstein - hilbert action @xmath14 where @xmath15 collectively denotes matter fields localized on the brane .",
    "there are various ways @xcite to see that the planck scale seen on the brane is related to the fundamental scale of gravity in higher dimensions via @xmath16 which equals @xmath17 when @xmath18 extra spatial dimensions are compactified over a torus of radius @xmath19 .",
    "obviously , larger the @xmath19 closer the @xmath6 to the electroweak scale @xcite . upon compactification ,",
    "the higher dimensional graviton gives rise to a tower of massive s , p and d states on the brane , and they participate in various scattering processes involving radiative corrections to sm parameters , missing energy signals as well as graviton exchange processes .",
    "the collider signatures of these processes have been discussed in detail in seminal papers @xcite .",
    "the add mechanism is based on higher dimensional einstein gravity with the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "however , given general covariance alone , there is no symmetry reason to guarantee that the action density in ( [ ah ] ) is unique . indeed",
    ", general covariance does not forbid the action density in ( [ ah ] ) to be generalized to a generic function @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 of curvature invariants .",
    "in fact , such modifications of einstein gravity have already been proposed and utilized for purposes of improving the renormalizability of the theory @xcite and for explaining recent acceleration of the universe @xcite . of course",
    ", once we depart from the minimal einstein - hilbert regime there is no rule whatsoever which can limit numbers and types of the invariants .",
    "our approach here , however , is to consider only those invariants which are of lowest mass dimension and are quadratic contractions of the curvature tensors : @xmath25 and @xmath26 in spite of fact that we do not have any symmetry reason for not considering the higher - derivative ones @xmath21 @xmath27 @xmath28 etc . in effect , we generalize einstein - hilbert term to a generic function @xmath29 of the curvature invariants , and derive and analyze effective interactions among brane matter induced by such modifications of higher dimensional einstein gravity",
    ".    the simplest generalization of ( [ ah ] ) would be to consider a generic function @xmath30 of the curvature scalar .",
    "this possibility has been analyzed in detail in the recent work @xcite , and it has been found that @xmath30 gravity effects are particularly pronounced and become distinguishable from those of the einstein gravity in scattering processes involving massive brane matter @xmath3 heavy fermions , weak bosons and the higgs boson ( for recent work on lovelock gravity see @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that @xmath30 theory is equivalent to einstein gravity plus an independent scalar field theory , and it is the propagation of this additional scalar that causes observable differences between the @xmath30 gravity and add setup in high energy processes @xcite .",
    "here it is worth emphasizing that considering @xmath31 theory instead of @xmath1 gravity is not a straightforward generalization .",
    "the reason is that the former is a four - derivative theory , and it is generically endowed with a spin=2 ghost @xcite .",
    "the presence of such negative - norm states constitutes the main difference between the two types of modified gravity theories , and goal of the present work is to examine their signatures in high - energy processes in a comparative fashion .",
    "such ghosty states are obviously dangerous in four dimensions ( care should be payed to nonlinearities though ) especially at large distances @xcite ; however , in a higher dimensional setting , it is the experiment ( at the lhc or ilc ) which will eventually establish presence or absence of such states whereby providing a deeper understanding of yet - to - be found quantum theory of gravity .    in this work",
    "we will consider a general modification of the einstein gravity , and discuss its physics implications in comparison with the add and @xmath30 gravity setups . in sec .",
    "2 below we derive graviton propagator and describe how it interacts with brane matter . here",
    "we put special emphasis on virtual graviton exchange . in sec .",
    "3 we study a number of higher dimensional operators which are sensitive to modified gravity effects . in sec .",
    "4 we briefly discuss some further signatures of modified gravity concerning graviton production and decay as well as certain loop observables on the brane . in sec .",
    "5 we conclude .",
    "the modification of the einstein gravity we consider is parameterized by @xmath32 where couplings to matter fields @xmath15 are identical to those in ( [ ah ] ) . here",

    "the second equality here reflects the fact that entire energy and momentum are localized on the brane .",
    "clearly , energy - momentum flow has to be conserved @xmath43 , and this is guaranteed to happen provided that @xmath44 .",
    "obviously , the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) reduce to einstein equations when @xmath45 . in general , for analyzing dynamics of small oscillations about a background geometry , @xmath46 with curvature scalar @xmath47 , @xmath48 must be regular at @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , as suggested by ( [ eom ] ) , @xmath48 must be regular at the origin and @xmath50 must vanish ( @xmath3 bulk cosmological constant must vanish ) for @xmath48 to admit a flat background geometry .    for determining how higher curvature gravity ( [ fr ] ) influences interactions among the brane matter , it is necessary to determine the propagating modes which couple to the matter stress tensor .",
    "this requires expansion of the action density by using ( [ metric ] ) up to the desired order in @xmath13 .",
    "the zeroth order term obviously vanishes .",
    "the terms first order in @xmath13 vanish by the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "the quadratic part , on the other hand , turns out to be @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that propagator of @xmath52 , defined via the relation @xmath53 takes the form @xmath54 where the form factors @xmath55 depend on the underlying theory of gravitation . in add setup ,",
    "based on einstein gravity , they are given by @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "in @xmath1 gravity none of them vanishes and their explicit expressions can be found in @xcite . in the framework of modified gravity discussed here ,",
    "they obtain nontrivial structures , too . for graviton - mediated interactions among brane - localized matter with conserved energy - momentum , only @xmath60 and @xmath61 are relevant , and they are given by @xmath62 where we introduced the mass scales @xmath63 parameterizing the non - minimal nature of the gravity theory considered . the remaining form factors @xmath64 can be obtained from ( [ prop - rel ] ) straightforwardly .",
    "though it does not appear in @xmath60 and @xmath61 above , in general , the propagator depends on the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath65 following from the gauge - fixing term @xmath66 added to the action density in ( [ sh ] ) . here , @xmath67 is introduced to match the terms generated by @xmath68 with the ones in ( [ sh ] ) .",
    "the de donder gauge , @xmath69 , is frequently employed in quantum gravity .",
    "having determined the propagator , it is timely to analyze gravi - particles in the system and their propagation characteristics .",
    "the propagating modes and their properties are determined by the pole structures of @xmath60 and @xmath70 ( and by the remaining form factors @xmath64 when the longitudinal polarizations are taken into account ) .",
    "indeed , the pole at @xmath71 guarantees the existence of a massless @xmath72 mode in @xmath7 dimensions . that this is the case directly follows from the projector @xmath73 multiplying @xmath74 . by restoring the longitudinal components via the replacement @xmath75 in each term of ( [ proj1 ] ) one ensures that the normal mode under concern corresponds to a massless @xmath72 excitation , the graviton @xcite .",
    "in fact , when @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 the whole propagator ( [ prop ] ) , as it should , reduces to that computed in the einstein gravity @xcite .    the second terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 combine to give a massive @xmath72 propagating mode . indeed",
    ", these two terms result in weighing of @xmath80 with the projector @xmath81 which corresponds to a massive @xmath72 excitation in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "the most spectacular aspect of this propagator is that it has a negative residue that is the excitation under concern is a ghost represented by negative norm states in hilbert space .",
    "this can be cured by no choice of the model parameters because the sole and obvious choice of negative @xmath67 converts the massless graviton discussed above into a ghost  an absolutely unwanted situation since then theory possesses no einsteinian limit at any mass scale .",
    "the existence of this tensorial ghost is a characteristic property of higher curvature gravity consisting of ricci and riemann tensors @xcite , and it actually plays a rather affirmative role in cancelling the divergences in loop calculations in the same sense as the pauli - villars regulation does in quantum field theory .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned tensor modes , as evidenced by the second line of @xmath60 , the particle spectrum also consists of a scalar particle with mass - squared @xmath82 .",
    "indeed @xmath83 is weighted by the projector @xmath84 which guarantees the scalar nature of the propagating mode .",
    "this mode is a tachyon as long as @xmath85 and @xmath86 have the same sign otherwise it is a true scalar field .",
    "the parameter values @xmath3 signs of @xmath86 and @xmath85 , competition between them as well as various other factors give rise to several possibilities .",
    "an interesting limit concerns @xmath87 , which can be achieved by taking a special @xmath48 with @xmath88 or @xmath89 , then the tensor ghost completely decouples from the spectrum .",
    "however , the scalar field continues to accompany the tensor ghost with mass @xmath90 in agreement with @xcite . for generating the pure einstein gravity one needs to send both @xmath85 and @xmath86 to @xmath91 which necessitates @xmath92 .",
    "having determined the gravi - particle spectrum of @xmath93 gravity in @xmath7 dimensions , we start analyzing the consequences of the compactness of the extra space .",
    "indeed , by letting extra space be torus - shaped with radius @xmath19 as in the add mechanism , the matter stress tensor obeys the kaluza - klein expansion @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a @xmath96-tuple of integers .",
    "given this fourier decomposition of the stress tensor , the amplitude for an on - brane system @xmath97 to make a transition into another on - brane system @xmath98 becomes @xmath99 where use has been made of ( [ planck ] ) in obtaining @xmath100 factor in front .",
    "though we are dealing with a tree - level process the amplitude involves a summation over all kaluza - klein levels due to the fact that these states are inherently virtual because of their propagation off the brane .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum implies that only the first two terms in the propagator ( [ prop ] ) contributes to ( [ amp ] ) , and after performing summation the transition amplitude takes the form @xmath101 which exhibits a huge overall enhancement @xmath102 compared to ( [ amp ] ) due to the contributions of finely - spaced kaluze - klein levels @xcite . here",
    "@xmath103 is the surface area of @xmath96-dimensional unit sphere and @xmath104 ( which is expected to be @xmath105 since above @xmath6 underlying quantum theory of gravity completes the classical treatment pursued here ) is the ultraviolet cutoff needed to tame divergent summation over kaluza - klein levels .",
    "in fact , @xmath106 exhibits a strong dependence on @xmath104 , as suggested by ( see also the corresponding series expressions derived in @xcite ) @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and @xmath109 for @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath112 , relevant for the timelike propagator ( [ time ] ) , is generated by exchange of on - shell gravitons @xmath3 those kaluza - klein levels satisfying @xmath113 .",
    "on the other hand , its real part follows from exchange of off - shell gravitons . for spacelike propagator ,",
    "the scattering amplitude ( [ space ] ) is real since in this channel kaluza - klein levels can not come on shell .    the first line of @xmath114 in ( [ as ] ) , except for the overall @xmath115 factor in front , is identical to virtual graviton exchange amplitude computed within the add setup .",
    "the stress tensors of the on - brane systems @xmath97 and @xmath98 contribute to the transition amplitude via their contractions @xmath116 and via the multiplication of their traces @xmath117 . while the former is effective for any two systems of particles @xcite , the latter can exist only for systems possessing conformal breaking @xcite .",
    "the second line of ( [ as ] ) , induced by the exchange of a massive graviton , is completely new in that it exists neither in add @xcite nor in @xmath1 gravity setups .",
    "the presence of the operator @xmath118 in this novel contribution proves particularly useful for distinguishing this general modification of gravity from @xmath1 theory since the latter can not induce brane - localized operators which involve contractions of the stress tensors .",
    "the third line of ( [ as ] ) is generated by exchange of the scalar graviton in the system .",
    "its contribution always involves traces of the stress tensors , and thus , for it to significantly influence a scattering process conformal invariance must be broken strongly ( masses of the brane - localized fields must be a significant fraction of @xmath6 ) , as has been analyzed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it may be of practical use to illustrate how novel structures induced by @xmath93 gravity compare with the ones already present in the add setup .",
    "as has been emphasized above , the higher - curvature gravity theory under concern modifies the coefficients of both @xmath119 and @xmath117 .",
    "the former is particularly useful for collider searches as well as effective operators at low - energies since it does not require systems @xmath97 and @xmath98 to consist of massive brane matter . in this respect",
    ", it could be useful to dwell on the coefficient of @xmath116 for determining how @xmath120 gravity contribution compares with the add prediction .",
    "this we do by plotting the real and imaginary parts of @xmath121 as a function of @xmath86 by taking , in accord with the future collider searches , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "their variations are plotted in figs .",
    "[ boncuk_1 ] and [ boncuk2 ] where @xmath86 is let vary from @xmath124 up to @xmath125 for each number of extra dimensions considered : @xmath126 ( solid ) , @xmath127 ( dot - dashed ) and @xmath128 ( short - dashed ) .",
    "these figures make it clear that massive graviton ( a ghosty tensor mode special to @xmath93 gravity ) exchange significantly dominates , if not competes , the massless graviton ( the only propagating mode in add setup ) exchange when the former is a tachyon with mass - squared @xmath129 ( excluding the rather narrow peak at @xmath130 which corresponds to resonating of the transition amplitude by kaluza - klein levels with mass - squared @xmath131 ) .",
    "the ghosty nature of the massive graviton affects only the sign of ( [ rfunc ] ) whereas its tachyonic nature gives rise to a spectacular enhancement in @xmath132 which in turn enables one to disentangle @xmath93 gravity effects from those of the einstein gravity in high - energy collider environment . from ( [ mphi ] )",
    "it is clear that a negative @xmath86 implies a positive @xmath133 since @xmath67 must be positive for preventing massless graviton from becoming a ghost .",
    "we now turn to discussion of the coefficient of @xmath117 in ( [ as ] ) for determining impact of @xmath93 gravity relative to einstein gravity .",
    "we quantify analysis by examining the ratio @xmath134 in a way similar to ( [ rfunc ] ) .",
    "this quantity does not have a direct meaning in interpreting the scattering rates of massive brane matter as they receive contributions from @xmath116 , too .",
    "nevertheless , for determining effects of higher - curvature gravity it could be instructive to determine how @xmath135 depends on various model parameters . depicted in fig .",

    "the figure shows it manifestly that @xmath93 gravity contributions completely dominate the one found in the add setup for large negative @xmath85 .",
    "the extra gravi - scalar , not found in einstein gravity , results in an enhancement in scattering amplitudes of massive brane matter .",
    "we also plot @xmath86 dependence of @xmath135 in fig .",
    "[ boncuk4 ] by taking @xmath140 and keeping other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ boncuk_3 ] . here , unlike the case study depicted in fig .",
    "[ boncuk_3 ] , gravi - particles decouple from the spectrum at large @xmath86 due to the fact that @xmath85 varies in proportion with @xmath86 .",
    "the figure suggests that @xmath120 gravity contribution is particularly enhanced in negative @xmath86 domain especially when @xmath141 . from the figures and their accompanying discussions",
    "one therefore concludes that , higher - curvature gravity theory ( [ fr ] ) provides additional gravi - particles and they result in significant enhancements in virtual gravi - particle exchange amplitudes with respect to both einstein @xcite and @xmath1 gravity theories .    in the next section",
    "we will survey and briefly discuss certain observables ( concerning especially collider searches for extra dimensions ) in light of the virtual gravi - particle exchange amplitude ( [ as ] ) and its discussions and illustrations via the figures .",
    "it might be instructive to discuss in some length certain higher dimensional operator structures which can leave significant impact on scatterings among brane - localized matter . from ( [ as ] )",
    "it is clear that virtual gravi - particle exchange between two systems of brane matter leads to dimension-8 operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "these additional interactions can open up novel scattering channels not found in the sm or modify the existing ones in an observable way .",
    "therefore , they are of potential importance for collider as well as precision physics of modified gravitational interactions in higher dimensions",
    ".    it may be convenient to group and analyze effects of higher dimensional operators according to the virtualities of the gravi - particles involved , as we do in the following subsections .",
    "the tree - level gravi - particle exchange , as has been detailed in the last section , gives rise to anomalous interactions among brane matter species @xcite .",
    "the on - brane processes are entirely tree - level ones in such processes ; however , they exhibit appreciable sensitivity to gravi - particle exchange due to rather high virtualities that gravi - particles obtain via their propagation through the extra dimensions . in general ,",
    "tree - level gravi - particle exchange induces various modifications in scattering processes , and they may be detected at colliders or in other experiments @xcite . at an @xmath142 collider , for instance , pair - productions of gauge bosons ( @xmath5 @xmath143 where @xmath144 ) and of fermions ( @xmath5 @xmath145 or any other quark or lepton )",
    "prove particularly useful for disentangling gravi - particle effects .",
    "in fact , existing results from lep experiments already provide precise bounds on such effects from pair - productions of gauge bosons and fermions @xcite .",
    "there also exist promising scattering processes at hadron ( @xmath146 collisions at the lhc and @xmath147 collisions at tevatron @xcite ) and lepton - hadron ( @xmath148 collisions at hera @xcite ) colliders which can probe gravi - particle effects at different energy scales with different particle species .",
    "in addition , there exist various phenomena , ranging from rare decays to supernovae and to ultra high energy cosmic rays , by which one can put bounds of varying strength on extra dimensions and nature of the gravitational theory in higher dimensional bulk",
    ".    it may be useful to examine some generic scattering processes for determining their power of disentangling the @xmath120 gravity effects .",
    "for instance , generic scattering amplitude @xmath149 for two identical fermions can be directly obtained via the replacements @xmath150 \\nonumber\\\\ t_{\\mu}^{(a)\\,\\mu } t_{\\nu}^{(b)\\,\\nu } & \\rightarrow & m_{\\psi_a } m_{\\psi_b } \\overline{\\psi}_a(k_2 ) \\psi_a(k_1)\\ ; \\overline{\\psi}_b(q_2 ) \\psi_b(q_1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the tree - level gravi - particle exchange amplitude ( [ as ] ) .",
    "these replacements correspond to @xmath151-channel gravi - particle exchange with @xmath152 , and depending on the quantum numbers of @xmath153 and @xmath154 it could be necessary to include @xmath155 and @xmath156 channel contributions , too .",
    "its comparison with the corresponding amplitude in add setup @xcite reveals that fermion - fermion scattering now proceeds with additional structures provided by second and third lines of ( [ as ] ) .",
    "they can compete in size with the add amplitude for certain parameter values , especially when the scattering energy @xmath157 compares with the new gravitational scales @xmath158 or @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "a highly interesting aspect of ( [ as ] ) with the replacements ( [ replace - fermion ] ) is that effects of the modified gravity ( due to the massive ghosty @xmath72 graviton ) survive even in the limit of massless fermions .",
    "this is , as one recalls form @xcite , not the case for @xmath1 gravity to which only scatterings of the massive brane matter exhibit sensitivity .",
    "this property of @xmath120 gravity is important in that its effects can be directly probed at high - energy colliders ( where colliding beams of matter are essentially massless ) and effective higher - dimensional operators consisting of light fermions . indeed ,",
    "lep - favored modes @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) or drell - yan annihilation of quarks at hadron colliders are golden modes for detecting modified gravity effects thanks to the fact that fermions ( of systems @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) under concern are massless . in general ,",
    "independent of if the brane matter is massive or massles , there are certain parameter values for which @xmath93 gravity contributions get significantly enhanced and thus become more easily observable with respect to einstein gravity effects as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ boncuk_1 ] , [ boncuk2 ] , [ boncuk_3 ] and [ boncuk4 ] .",
    "the @xmath162 fermion scattering example above can be generalized to any other sm particle , and the relative enhancements / suppressions in their rates are always governed by ( [ as ] ) with supplementary illustrations given in the figures .",
    "a dedicated search for extra dimensions via virtual gravi - particle exchange processes requires a global analysis of various collider processes @xcite .",
    "the most advantageous aspect of @xmath93 gravity is the separability of massive ghosty graviton contribution from those of the remaining gravi - particles via the measurement of the scattering rates of massless ( or more precisely much lighter than the fundamental scale of gravity ) matter species .",
    "the loop - level processes on the brane proceed with looping brane matter and/or gravi - particles where the latter are now virtual both in ordinary and extra dimensions .",
    "these effects can give rise to corrections to the existing sm amplitudes as in , for instance , electroweak precision observables ( particle self energies , interaction vertices , box diagrams ) and rare decays @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dedicated analysis of @xcite shows that gravi - particle loop effects can become more important than their tree - level effects since they can induce potentially important dimension-6 operators with double gravi - particle exchange .",
    "this lower - dimension operator can arise in fermion , gauge boson as well as higgs sectors of the sm .    for illustrating the impact of @xmath93 gravity , consider dimension-6 four - fermion operator @xmath163 ( @xmath164 , @xmath165 standing for light quarks or leptons ) which has been shown to follow from double gravi - particle exchange in @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation shows it is quite sensitive to exchange novel propagating degrees of freedom in higher curvature gravity .",
    "indeed , for massless fermions , for instance , coefficient of this operator for @xmath166 is @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 times larger than the coefficient of the same operator computed in the add setup @xcite for @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 and @xmath173 extra dimensions .",
    "the reason for this , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ boncuk_1 ] and [ boncuk2 ] , is the enhancement of @xmath120 gravity contributions compared to einstein gravity at this specific value of @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , existing experimental results on contact interactions , dijet and dilepton production processes as well as lepton - hadron scattering rates can put stringent limits on the model parameters @xmath96 , @xmath104 , @xmath174 , @xmath86 and @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis of @xcite shows that the strongest bounds come from lep results on contact interactions @xcite .",
    "repeating , at the loop - level gravi - particle exchange gives rise to observable modifications on various phenomena testable at the present and future collider studies .",
    "therefore , essentially what remains to be done is to perform a global analysis of the observables so as to achieve bounds or exclusion limits on @xmath93 gravity parameters .",
    "in addition to their virtual effects just mentioned , the gravi - particles can decay into brane - matter or can be produced by scatterings among the brane matter @xcite .",
    "while the former plays a crucial role in cosmological and astrophysical contexts , the latter constitutes one of the most important signatures of extra dimensions at colliders in that gravi - particle emission from the brane gives rise to scattering processes with single missing energy signal , and thus , it is of fundamental importance for distinguishing supersymmetric models from the extra dimensional ones . in these real gravi - particle involving",
    "processes the presence of bulk masses for tensor and scalar modes modify decay signatures significantly , as has been detailed in @xcite .    for a clearer view of the effects of gravi - particle decay / emssion it proves useful to refer to their loop effects .",
    "indeed , the @xmath175 boson self - energy , for example , represents , via the optical theorem , the drell - yan production of gravi - particles and @xmath175 boson at lepton ( via @xmath176 annihilation ) or hadron ( via @xmath177 annihilation ) colliders .",
    "the main novelty brought about by @xmath178 gravity is the production of @xmath72 ghost and the scalar mode when the center - of - mass energy of the collider is sufficiently large .",
    "this phenomenon reflects by itself a sudden change in the number of events ( similar to opening of @xmath179 channel at lep experiments ) . the dominant contribution to",
    "gravi - particle emission comes from kaluza - klein levels in the vicinity of @xmath180 .",
    "however , one here notes an important aspect of gravi - particle decay / emission processes : for such processes all gravi - particles must be fields with positive semi - definite mass - squareds and hence , as in @xmath1 gravity @xcite , one does not expect significant contributions from gravi - particles other than @xmath181 graviton ( see the figures fig .",

    "the higher - curvature gravity theory discussed in this work offer various signatures which distinguish it from the einstein and @xmath182 gravity theories , and a global survey of laboratory , astrophysical and cosmological observables ( see @xcite can reveal presence or absence of such higher - curvature generalizations of the einstein - hilbert action . indeed , affirmative or negative , the answer will be crucial for establishing the gravitational interactions beyond fermi energies and may pave the road to a full understanding of quantum gravity .",
