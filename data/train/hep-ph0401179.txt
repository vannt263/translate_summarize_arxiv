    "according to the predictions of unified gauge theories , supersymmetry , supergravity , and string theory , there would exist a number of light and massless particles @xcite .",
    "an exchange of such particles between two bodies gives rise to an additional force .",
    "additional fundamental forces at short distances were intensively studied , in particular during last few years following the hypothesis about `` large '' supplementary spatial dimensions proposed by arkami - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali @xcite , building on earlier ideas in refs @xcite . for a review of theoretical works and recent experimental results ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis could be verified using neutrons because the absence of an electric charge allows one to strongly suppress the false electromagnetic effects @xcite .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that the measurement of the neutron quantum states in the earth s gravitational field @xcite is sensitive to such extra forces in the sub - micrometer range . in the case of @xmath0 extra dimensions ,",
    "the characteristic range is just in the nanometer domain @xcite which is accesible in this experiment .",
    "the first attempt to establish a model - dependent boundary in the range 110 @xmath1 m , was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an effective gravitational interaction in presence of an additional yukawa - type force is parametrized as : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are interacting masses , @xmath6 their relative distance , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are strength and characteristic range of this hypothetical interaction .",
    "the experiment @xcite consists in the measurement of the neutron flux through a slit between a horizontal mirror on bottom and a scatterer / absorber on top as a function of the slit size @xmath9 .",
    "this dependence is sensitive to the presence of quantum states of neutrons in the potential well formed by the earth s gravitational field and the mirror . in particular ,",
    "the neutron flux was measured to be equal to zero within the experimental accuracy if the slit size @xmath9 was smaller than the characteristic spatial size ( a quasiclasssical turning point height ) of the lowest quantum state of @xmath10 m in this potential well . the neutron flux at the slit size @xmath11 m was lower by at least a factor of 200 than that for the lowest quantum state(@xmath12 m ) .",
    "if an additional short - range force of sufficiently high strength would act between neutrons and the mirror then it would modify the quantum states parameters : an attractive force would `` compress '' the wave functions towards the mirror , while a repulsive force would shift them up . in this experiment ,",
    "no deviation from the expected values was observed within the experimental accuracy .",
    "this accuracy is defined by the uncertainty in the slit size which can be conservatively estimated as @xmath13 30 % for the lowest quantum state @xcite .",
    "the motion of neutrons in this system over the vertical axis @xmath14 could be considered , within first and quite good approximation , as an one dimentional problem for which the mirror provides an infinitely high potential .",
    "the interaction between neutrons and the earth is described by the first term in equation ( [ intergen ] ) and can be approximated by the usual linear potential ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the earth s radius , @xmath19 its mass , @xmath20 the neutron mass .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ intergen ] ) introduces an additional interaction . due to the short range of this interaction , its main contribution",
    "is provided by the interaction of neutrons with a thin surface layer of the mirror and the scatterer .    in this article , we estimate an upper limit on an additional attractive short - range force , which could be established from this experiment in a model - independent way . we show that it could not be significantly improved in any more sophisticated model .",
    "let us estimate firstly the interaction of neutrons with the mirror .",
    "if the mirror s density is constant and equals to @xmath21 , then an additional potential of the interaction between neutrons and the mirror is given by : @xmath22 the volume integral is calculated over the mirror bulk : @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( in fact , over the neutron s vicinity with the size of the order of a few @xmath8 due to the exponential convergency of these integrals ) . it can be calculated analytically for small @xmath8 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 .    the simplest upper limit on the strength of an additional interaction follows from the condition that this additional interaction does not create itself any bound state",
    ". it is known @xcite that for an exponential attractive ( @xmath27 ) potential ( [ newint ] ) this means that : @xmath28 this condition gives a boundary for an additional potential strength : @xmath29 @xmath30 being the earth s averaged density . in this experiment , both densities are close to each other @xmath31 , therefore their ratio @xmath32 is close to 1 .",
    "however an adequate choice of the mirror material ( coating ) would easily allow one to gain a factor of 35 in the sensitivity in future experiments .",
    "one obtains the following numerical boundary : @xmath33 here , 1 @xmath1 m is chosen as a natural scale for this experiment .",
    "this limit is presented in figure  [ figlimit ] in comparison with the limits coming from the casimir - like and van der waals force measurement experiments @xcite .",
    "one can note that , in the realistic case , one has to establish a condition of non existence of an additional bound state for the sum of ( [ mgz ] ) and ( [ newint ] ) but not for the interaction ( [ newint ] ) alone .",
    "a presence of the linear potential modifies slightly the critical value in ( [ limsimple ] ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath34 m it equals approximately to 1.0 and for @xmath35 m it equals to 0.74 . for smaller @xmath8 ,",
    "this value is evident to tend to 0.72 .",
    "it is possible to explain qualitatively why the strength of an additional interaction should be higher in presence of the @xmath36-potential than without it .",
    "when a bound state just appears , then its wave function is extremely spread .",
    "if one adds a supplementary `` external '' confining potential , it does not allow the wave function to be spreaded and thus one needs a stronger potential to create a bound state .",
    "the range of presented @xmath8 is 1 nm ",
    "10 @xmath1 m .",
    "a deviation from a straight line in the solid curve at 1 nm is due to the finite range of increase of the mirror effective nuclear potential ( impurities on the surface and its roughness ) .",
    "the same effect at @xmath37 m is due to an `` interference '' of the potentials ( [ mgz ] ) and ( [ newint ] ) .",
    "following from the experiment @xcite ( the solid line ) in comparison with that from the measurement of the casimir and the van der waals forces @xcite ( the dashed line ) .",
    "the dotted line shows a limit which can be easily obtained by an improvement of this experiment .",
    "the solid horizontal line represents the limit established from the atomic experiment @xcite .",
    "[ figlimit ] ]    it is interesting to compare this analytical limit ( [ statesnumbound ] ) to an analogous expression obtained in @xcite for the casimir force - like experiments .",
    "the simplest boundary @xmath38 following from these experiments is given by a formula : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a gap separation and @xmath41 is a constant depending on the geometry of different experiments .",
    "this function increases exponentially when @xmath8 tends to zero .",
    "this behaviour is clearly seen in figure  [ figlimit ] . in the experiment",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath42 and @xmath43 increases only as @xmath44 ! this difference between ( [ cas ] ) and ( [ neut ] ) means that , in principle , for any @xmath41 and @xmath45 , one could find a domain of sufficiently small but experimentally observable @xmath8 in which the limit obtained from our experiment is stronger than that obtained from a casimir force - like experiment .    up to now , we have not discussed the scatterer .",
    "as we can see from figure  [ figlimit ] , a competitive limit could be established only for @xmath8 much smaller than the scatterer roughness amplitude of the order of 1 @xmath1 m .",
    "therefore an influence of the scatterer is negligible .",
    "unfortunately , this experiment does not allow us to establish a competitive limit for a repulsive interaction .",
    "in this case , there could be no `` additional '' bound state . here , instead of the condition of `` non - existence '' of a bound state , one could consider the critical slit size for which the first bound state appears in this system .",
    "such an approach would be model - dependent due to uncertainties in the description of the interaction of neutrons with the scatterer . nevertheless , it is possible to obtain a simple analytical expression for small @xmath8 and to show explicitly a difference in sensitivity of this experiment to an attractive and to a repulsive additional interactions .",
    "let us remind the reader that the quasiclassical approximation for the potential composed by the linear term @xmath36 and by the infinite mirror potential describes the problem very well . for instance , it gives the ground state energy , for which the quasiclassical approximation is usually expected to be not valid , within 1 % @xcite .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantification condition in this case assumes that the quasiclassical wave function @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the turning point ) equals to zero at @xmath50 ( at the inpenetrable mirror ) .",
    "this condition , for @xmath51-th quantum state , means @xmath52 and the corresponding energies are : @xmath53 with an additional short - range repulsive interaction @xmath54 , the problem could be solved in an analogous way .",
    "one can choose such @xmath55 that @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 , the @xmath36 potential is negligible and the problem can be solved analytically @xcite . for @xmath58",
    ", one can use the quasiclassical approximation . at @xmath59 the quasiclassical wave function should be equal to the exact one : @xmath60 with the phase shift @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the euler constant , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the modified bessel functions of pure imaginary argument .",
    "this phase shift modifies the bohr - sommerfeld quantification condition and introduces a shift @xmath67 in the level s energy .",
    "if this shift is small with respect to the nonperturbated value , one obtains the following relation between the energy shift @xmath67 and the phase shift @xmath68 : @xmath69^{1/2 } = \\delta_0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for very strong repulsive potential , @xmath70 , the phase shift is equal to @xmath71 an experimental upper limit on the energy shift @xmath67 would impose an upper limit on @xmath7 for a repulsive interaction : @xmath72 with @xmath73 or @xmath74 direct comparison of relation ( [ repulsalph ] ) to ( [ limsimple ] ) and ( [ statesbound ] ) shows that the limit ( [ repulsalph ] ) at small @xmath8 is sufficiently less restrictive than that for an attractive one ( [ statesbound ] ) due to the exponential factor .",
    "note that the presented approach could be applied as well for an attractive interaction @xmath75 . in this case , the phase shift is equal to @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the bessel functions .",
    "this expression is maximal in the vicinity of the first bessel function s zero @xmath79 where it can be developped as @xmath80 one thus obtains the relation between the strength of an attractive potential and the energy shift @xmath81 : @xmath82 with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "if one omits the second term in the latter equation , one obtains exactly the relations ( [ limsimple ] ) and ( [ statesbound ] ) representing a condition of non - existance of an additional bound state .",
    "let us mention that this formula allows us to estimate the capability of this experiment to further improve an upper limit on @xmath7 in the case of an attractive interaction : in order to improve significantly ( by an order of magnitude ) the limit ( [ statesbound ] ) in a given range of @xmath8 it is necessary to determine experimentally and theoretically the parameters of quantum states with a precision @xmath86 .",
    "the considerations presented above are valid only if the neutron population in the lowest quantum state in such a system ( with an additional interaction included ) if sufficiently high to provide a measurable signal / noise ratio .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the experiment @xcite would allow one to identify an additional quantum state if its occupation number would not be suppressed by more than a factor of 200 compared to that for other states .    in order to calculate the occupation numbers ,",
    "let us start with a general expression for the probability of a rapid transition from a state @xmath87 with the wave function @xmath88 to a state @xmath51 with the wave function @xmath89 which is given by a formula @xcite : @xmath90 for a few initial quantum states , the probability @xmath91 is a sum ( an integral for continius spectrum ) over them : @xmath92 with the occupation numbers @xmath93 of initial states .    to obtain an analytical expression for the occupation numbers ,",
    "let us consider a simplified model of a harmonic oscillator in a final state and a plane wave in an initial one .",
    "an explicite analytical shape of the final state wave function does not play a role ( the only important parameter is its spatial size ) and would not modify considerably the occupation numbers .",
    "the used wave functions are equal to @xmath94{\\pi x_0 ^ 2 } } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n n ! } } \\exp \\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2x_0 ^ 2}\\right ) h_n\\left ( \\frac{x}{x_0}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath95 here @xmath96 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath97 represents a characteristic geometric size of the problem",
    ".    if initial states are populated according to the gaussian law with a chercteristic momentum @xmath98 then @xmath99 and all integrals ( [ fewtran ] ) can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "the occupation numbers of the final states appear to be equal to : @xmath100 here @xmath101 is the legendre polinomial .",
    "for instance , for the lowest states with @xmath102 and @xmath103 : @xmath104 if @xmath105 then the occupation numbers are approximately equal for all states : @xmath106    let us apply these expressions to our problem .",
    "for the gravitational quantum states , @xmath107 m ; the vertical velocity distribution has a characteristic velocity of @xmath108  cm / s .",
    "for these states , @xmath109 and all states should have approximately the same occupation numbers .",
    "if an additional bound state were created by the interaction ( [ newint ] ) then the characteristic size of such a state should be of the order of the range of the interaction @xmath8 ( or bigger ) .",
    "for the interaction range , for which this experiment establishes a competitive limit , one obtains @xmath110 for @xmath111  nm and @xmath112 for @xmath113  nm . as we mentioned previously , if such a state exists it would be detected in this experiment .",
    "moreover , these numbers represent a lower estimation for the occupation numbers because they assume the state to be deeply bound . for a just appearing state ,",
    "the characteristic size @xmath97 would be sufficiently bigger than the range of the interaction and would be close to that of the unperturbed states in the gravitational potential . thus the population would not be almost suppressed .",
    "to complete our analysis in the nanometer range , let us note that a competitive limit follows from a recent experiment with antiprotonic atoms as well .",
    "the idea of such an analysis is the same as in ref .",
    "an additional force between a nucleus of mass @xmath19 and an antiproton would change the spectrum of such an atom .",
    "the effective orbit radius @xmath114 for usually studied antiproton - nucleus atoms is about a few hundreeds fm .",
    "therefore , for the range of a hypothetical yukawa force @xmath115 , an additional potential would have a @xmath116 behaviour and would change the coulomb potential : @xmath117 the energy spectrum @xmath118 of an atom with a reduced mass @xmath1 as well as the transition frequences @xmath119 would be modified as well : @xmath120 thus , the constant @xmath7 is related to the shift @xmath121 in the transition frequencies by a formula @xmath122 an upper experimental limit on the transition frequency shift @xmath123 imposes an upper limit on @xmath124 .",
    "the most precise measurement of the energy spectrum of antiprotonic atoms was done for p@xmath125he@xmath126 and p@xmath127he@xmath126 atoms by the asakusa collaboration at the antiproton decelerator at cern @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "13 electromagnetic transitions between different levels of these atoms were investigated .",
    "no deviation was found from the values expected within the qed calculations @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ alpvisfreq ] ) allows @xmath7 to be extracted .",
    "the averaged over these 13 transitions value of @xmath7 is equal : @xmath128 and is compatible with zero .",
    "a @xmath129 upper limit on @xmath124 from this experiment is : @xmath130 .",
    "an upper limit to an additional attractive force is established from the measurement of quantum states of neutrons in the earth s gravitational field .",
    "relatively high sensitivity of the experiment @xcite to a hypothetical additional force is due to the following factors : firstly , no `` background '' electromagnetic interactions ; secondly , the characteristic size of the neutron wave function in the quantum states fits well to the range of interest for the short - range forces ; finally , non - negligible probability to find neutrons ( quantum - mechanical object ) at distances much closer to the mirror than the average value of 10 @xmath1 m .",
    "however , it can be easily improved in the same kind of experiment with some evident modifications , for instance , one can choose a mirror material ( coating ) with higher density .",
    "a more significant gain in the sensitivity could be achieved in a dedicated neutron experiment which will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
