    "currently , one of the most popular alternatives to the _ concordance model _ is based on modifications of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "such models first became popular in the 1980 s because it was shown that they naturally admit a phase of accelerated expansion which could be associated with an early universe inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "the fact that the phenomenology of dark energy requires the presence of a similar phase ( although only a late time one ) has recently revived interest in these models .",
    "in particular , the idea that dark energy may have a geometrical origin , i.e. , that there is a connection between dark energy and a non - standard behavior of gravitation on cosmological scales is consequently a very active area of research .",
    "one such modification is based on gravitational actions which are non - linear in the ricci curvature @xmath2 and@xmath3or contain terms involving combinations of derivatives of @xmath2 @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", these theories have provided a number of very interesting results on both cosmological @xcite and astrophysical @xcite scales . an important feature of these theories is that the field equations can be recast in a way that the higher order corrections are written as an energy - momentum tensor of geometrical origin describing an  effective \" source term on the right hand side of the standard einstein field equations @xcite . in this _ curvature quintessence _",
    "scenario , the cosmic acceleration can be shown to result from such a new geometrical contribution to the cosmic energy density budget , due to higher order corrections of the hilbert - einstein lagrangian .    of considerable importance to the study of the cosmology of these models",
    "is the existence of exact power ",
    "law solutions corresponding to phases of cosmic evolution when the energy density is dominated by a perfect fluid .",
    "the existence of such solutions is particularly relevant because in friedmann ",
    "lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) backgrounds , they typically represent asymptotic or intermediate states in the full phase  space of the dynamical system representing all possible cosmological evolutions .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the implications for the gravitational action if _ exact",
    "_ flrw power ",
    "law solutions in @xmath0 gravity are assumed to exist .",
    "we discover that such solutions only occur for a very special class of @xmath0 theories .",
    "this result is complementary to one recently found for @xmath4 gravity models @xcite .",
    "we consider the following action within the context of four  dimensional homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes , i.e. , the ( flrw ) universes with negligible spatial curvature : @xmath5\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is general differentiable ( at least @xmath7 ) function of the ricci scalar and @xmath8 corresponds to the matter lagrangian .",
    "units are chosen so that @xmath9 .",
    "it follows that the field equations for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes are the _ raychaudhuri equation _",
    "@xmath10\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the volume expansion , which defines the scale factor @xmath12 along the fluid flow lines via the standard relation @xmath13 , and @xmath14 abbreviates @xmath15 for @xmath16 ; the _ friedmann equation _ @xmath17\\;;\\ ] ] the _ trace equation _ [ trace ] 3f=-3p + fr-2f-3f-3f^2 ; and the _ energy conservation equation _ for standard matter @xmath18 combining the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations , we obtain @xmath19      analogously to @xcite , let us now assume there exists an _",
    "exact _ power  law solution to the field equations , i.e. , the scale factor behaves as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a _ fixed _ real number .",
    "we further assume that the standard matter can be described by a barotropic perfect fluid such that @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] . from the energy conservation equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath24 and from ( [ r ] ) we see that the ricci scalar becomes @xmath25 note that @xmath26 if @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , so the value of @xmath30 fixes the sign of the ricci scalar .    using the background solutions above",
    ", we can write the friedmann , raychaudhuri and trace equations in terms of functions of time @xmath31 only , assuming with no loss of generality that @xmath32 .    considering values of @xmath33",
    ", we can then solve ( [ r_pl ] ) for @xmath31 and re  write these equations in terms of the ricci scalar @xmath2 , @xmath0 and its derivatives with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the friedmann equation for example becomes    fr^2+fr+f+(2m-1)k()^m(1+w)=0 , [ friedman - r ]    where @xmath34 .",
    "note that for the power  law solution ( [ a - pl ] ) , @xmath35 is positive at all times , and therefore equation ( [ friedman - r ] ) is real - valued over the range of @xmath2 .",
    "since we want ( [ a - pl ] ) to be a solution at all times , i.e. , @xmath2 spans over an entire branch of the real axis , we can interpret ( [ friedman - r ] ) as a differential equation for the function @xmath6 in @xmath2 space .",
    "solving this equation gives the following general solution    f(r)=a_mw()^ m ( 1 + w ) + c_1r^-++c_2r^-- , [ f(r ) ]    where we have abbreviated @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 are arbitrary constants of integration .",
    "we note that the above form of @xmath6 identically satisfies the other field equations , if we similarly convert them into differential equations in @xmath2 space .",
    "note that @xmath39 for cosmologically viable solutions with @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the exponents in the solution are all real valued in the case considered here .",
    "also @xmath40 is real- valued and non  zero unless @xmath41 , but diverges if @xmath30 and @xmath42 satisfy the relationship @xmath43 . in general , the function @xmath0 is real  valued if @xmath30 and @xmath42 do not satisfy the above relationship , and if @xmath26 ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "furthermore , if we want to ensure that for @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] the theory reduces to gr , then we have to set @xmath47 . in that case , the solution ( [ f(r ) ] ) is real - valued for all @xmath2 provided @xmath48 . if we re - write @xmath49 , then we can see that we recover the well - known result that in @xmath1-gravity , there exists an exact friedman - like power - law solution @xmath50 .",
    "the gr  limit can now be identified as the case @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting to use the solutions found above to reconstruct the effective scalar field often invoked to describe the dynamics of @xmath0 gravity models . using this analogy ,",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that @xmath0 theories suffer from a singularity problem , namely that in the past , at finite time , the dynamics drives the model towards infinite values of the curvature corresponding to points in the scalar field potential atteignable for finite values of the scalar field .",
    "moreover , the effective potential of the models studied in @xcite are multivalued , which is a very unnatural feature . in what follows",
    "we will show that the models ( [ f(r ) ] ) that lead to power - law solutions for the scale factor do not suffer from such pathological behaviors , but admit a well - defined scalar field representation with a single - valued potential and no curvature singularity .",
    "the fact that the curvature is well behaved can be directly inferred from eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) since the only divergence occurs for @xmath52 , or equivalently , for @xmath53 , and this simply corresponds to a standard big - bang type singularity .",
    "we adopt the representation in terms of a scalar field used in @xcite , by defining the scalar field @xmath54 and its potential @xmath55 through the following equations : @xmath56 the shape of the potential is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for various values of the equation of state and of the constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 .     for @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the case",

    ", the scalar field starts at high absolute values and goes down its potential to asymptotically freeze at @xmath69 . in the case",
    "@xmath70 , the shape of the potential depends on the presence of non - zero @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but the dynamics nevertheless drives @xmath54 towards a constant value at late times .     for @xmath59 and @xmath71 in the case",
    "this corresponds to @xmath0 with the first term in ( [ f(r ) ] ) proportional to @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "right panel : same model as in the left plot but with @xmath64.,width=340 ]",
    "we have shown here that _",
    "exact _ power - law solutions in @xmath0-gravity can only exist for the very specific form of @xmath0 given in ( [ f(r ) ] ) .",
    "if we ask for the theory to have the correct gr limit , then this @xmath0 simply reduces to @xmath1 .",
    "this makes @xmath1 gravity very special in the sense that it is the only @xmath0 model that allows for exact power - law solutions .",
    "models with actions allowing for terms of the form @xmath74 for example , as studied in @xcite , do not allow for exact power - law backgrounds unless we reduce to the gr background @xmath75 .",
    "we do not exclude the existence of cosmologically viable trajectories for a general @xmath0 , but suggest that these trajectories may correspond to more complicated exact solutions that asymptotically scale like power - law solutions .",
    "we emphasize that one must make sure that such background solutions _ exist _ before performing perturbation theory .",
    "it is not enough to simply perturb around an exact power - law background , since this exact background solution does not exist unless @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the above work suggests that in a dynamical systems analysis of any @xmath77 theory other than @xmath1 , one should not expect to find any equilibrium points corresponding to exact power - law solutions .",
    "we conclude that there is a qualitative difference between @xmath1 and any other @xmath0-model in the sense that @xmath1 has exact power - law solutions even in the non - perturbative non - gr case ( e.g. for @xmath78 ) , while any other @xmath77 can only allow these exact solutions in the gr - limit .",
    "therefore , perturbations around these background solutions should be carried out with caution .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the singularity that appears in other @xmath0 models is not present for the class of models derived from the requirement of a power - law expansion , which is manifest in the scalar field analogy , in which the scalar field potential is a well behaved function of the value of the field @xmath54 .",
