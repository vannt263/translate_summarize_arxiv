    "although a considerable amount of theoretical and experimental work has been devoted to the subject , the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) still remains poorly understood . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "one of the main reasons for this state of affairs is that the ab - initio lattice qcd approach has difficulties to deal with the region of medium / low temperatures and moderately high densities , owing to the so - called `` sign problem ''  @xcite .",
    "thus , most of the present knowledge about the strongly interacting matter phase diagram arises from the study of effective models  @xcite .",
    "this is because effective models offer the possibility of obtaining predictions for the transition features at regions that are not accessible through lattice techniques . in this context , in the last years several works have considered that , at low temperatures , the transition between the chirally broken phase at low densities and the color superconducting phase at large densities proceeds in a smooth way instead of being a strong first - order transition , as is more commonly believed .",
    "interestingly , this opens up the possibility that , as density increases , quark matter undergoes a crossover between a regime where diquark pairs form difermion molecules in bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and a weakly coupled bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid regime  @xcite .",
    "one of the models where this kind of phenomena has been more actively investigated is the well - known nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , where gluon - mediated interactions are replaced by effective local quark - quark interactions .",
    "the actual existence of a bec - bcs crossover in the three - color ( @xmath2 ) njl model requires , however , a quite strong quark pairing interaction .",
    "let us recall that the application of the fierz transformations to the effective one gluon exchange interaction ( oge ) leads to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the scalar quark - antiquark and the diquark coupling constants , respectively .",
    "this value is usually taken as a reference in most model calculations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the existence of a bec - bcs crossover at finite baryon chemical potential requires @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued , however , that in the flavor su(3 ) njl model the axial anomaly might induce a bec - bcs crossover for more conventional values of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "other possibility has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "contrary to what happens for @xmath2 , the situation for the @xmath8 njl model is quite clear . in this case , the fierz transformation of the oge interaction leads to @xmath9 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this value of @xmath7 ,",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite find that as the quark chemical potential @xmath10 increases , there is first , at @xmath11 , a second - order transition from the chirally broken phase to the bec phase , followed by the bec - bcs crossover at a somewhat larger chemical potential .",
    "this result was confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the fact the two - color njl model might only share some qualitative similarities with real three - color qcd , it is still a valuable model for studying in general .",
    "in fact , studies with two - color qcd like models , in particular in the context of the njl model , have been quite popular ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "because of the different gauge group of two - color qcd ( which has only pseudoreal , or real representations ) as compared to the three - color case , the fermion determinant in the former remains real for nonvanishing chemical potentials ( for baryons or quarks ) .",
    "hence , the model does not suffer from the fermion - sign problem that plagues the three - color qcd and its phase diagram can be studied through lattice monte - carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "besides , the two - color njl model can be seen as a relativistic analogue of the low energy non - relativistic bcs - bec crossover in condensed matter fermionic systems . given the above properties , we hope to learn some of the related physics associated with diquarks condensation in real qcd by using this simpler model and the generic properties connected to a bec - bcs transition in fermionic systems in general .    in the present work",
    ", we will be mainly interested in the role played by a magnetic field in the bec - bcs transition problem .",
    "this is mostly motivated by the realization that strong magnetic fields may be produced in several physically relevant situations .",
    "for example , the compact stellar objects believed to be the source of intense @xmath12 and x - rays , the magnetars , are expected to bear fields of the order of @xmath13 g at their surface@xcite , reaching values several orders of magnitude greater at their center  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "such strong magnetic fields are also expected in present and future experiments at the rhic , nica and fair facilities , designed to probe the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at low temperatures and intermediate - to - large densities .",
    "so far , the effect of magnetic field on the bec / bcs crossover has been analyzed in the context of a two - channel model  @xcite , where fermion and boson degrees of freedom are introduced from the beginning in the corresponding effective lagrangian density .",
    "the aim of the present study is to go beyond this by considering a single channel model .",
    "since this is already a quite complicated issue by itself , we will work in the framework of the two - color njl model , where the existence of a bec - bcs crossover for conventional model parameterizations is firmly established .",
    "we recall here that , in contrast to what happens in @xmath2 qcd , this theory allows for lattice simulations at finite chemical potential .",
    "results from this model regarding the diquark condensation in the absence of magnetic fields have been compared , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , with lattice simulations of @xmath8 qcd  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the predictions of the njl model for the diquark condensate are similar than those of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , as far the agreement with lattice results are concerned .",
    "the njl model is therefore interesting to investigate the general symmetry properties associated with two - color quark matter and their role in the phase transitions .",
    "moreover , some aspects of the impact of the presence of external magnetic fields on the properties of two - color quark matter at finite temperature and vanishing chemical potential have been investigated using both effective models  @xcite and lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ thpot ] we introduce a two - color and two - flavor njl - type model in the presence of a magnetic field and the corresponding thermodynamic potential to study the phase structure and , in particular , the bec - bcs transition .",
    "some possible regularization schemes used in the literature are also given . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we give the results of our analysis and also make a comparison between different regularizations used when regarding the critical quantities and the crossover . in sec .",
    "[ results2 ] , we interpret the results obtained and check for their consistency . our concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "one appendix is included , where some of the technical details are given .",
    "we start by specifying the model and its parameters . we consider a two - color and two - flavor njl - type model that includes scalar - pseudoscalar and color pairing interactions . the corresponding lagrangian density , in the presence of an external electromagnetic field ,",
    "is given by    @xmath14 % \\nonumber\\\\ & & + g_d \\left(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma_5 \\tau_2 t_2 c\\bar{\\psi}^t\\right )   \\left(\\psi^t ci\\gamma_5\\tau_2 t_2 \\psi\\right)~.   \\label{lag1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath15 is the charge conjugation matrix and @xmath16 is the current fermion mass , which we take to be equal for both flavors .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pauli matrices in flavor and color spaces , respectively . as usual",
    ", we will assume that the interaction terms are derived from an effective local coupling between color current terms .",
    "the two coupling constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for the present two - color njl model  @xcite can be related simply as @xmath19 .",
    "this relation has to be imposed in order to have the symmetries of two - color qcd , and must be satisfied regardless of the type of the effective interaction that we start from .",
    "the coupling of the quarks to the electromagnetic field @xmath20 is implemented through the covariant derivative , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the usual quark charge matrix @xmath23 . in the present @xmath8 model",
    "we choose the charges to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in this way , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the charged fermions can be considered to mimic the rotated charged quarks that pair to form the electrically neutral cooper pairs in actual qcd .",
    "note , however , that while in the latter case quark matter will still behave as a color superconductor , two - color cooper pairs are color - singlets .",
    "therefore , in the two - color qcd we are dealing with a true superfluid where just a global ( baryon number ) symmetry is spontaneously broken . finally , we consider that the system is in the presence of a static and constant magnetic field in the third - direction , namely , we take @xmath26 .      at vanishing magnetic field , the mean - field thermodynamic potential at temperature @xmath27 and chemical potential @xmath10",
    "is given by  @xcite    @xmath28\\right\\}~ ,   \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the zero temperature contribution ,    @xmath30    and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the dressed quark mass .",
    "the addition of a finite constant magnetic field can be easily implemented in the above expressions by considering the following substitutions  @xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 takes into account the degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "therefore , the resulting zero - temperature mean - field thermodynamic potential in the presence of a constant magnetic field reads    @xmath35    in the following , we will discuss the different ways to regularize the thermodynamic potential when including the effects of an external magnetic field .",
    "since the model under consideration is non - renormalizable , a proper regularization scheme is required to avoid ultraviolet divergences . as it will be discussed below for the regularization procedures to be used in this work , this implies the existence of a cutoff parameter @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the coupling constant @xmath37 , the current quark mass @xmath16 and @xmath36 form a set of three parameters that must be specified in order to proceed with the numerical calculations . in the case of the @xmath2 njl model analysis ,",
    "these parameters are usually fixed such as to reproduce the empirical values in vacuum for the pion mass @xmath38 , the pion decay constant @xmath39 and for the quark condensate @xmath40 .",
    "the situation for the @xmath8 case is not , however , so clear . here ,",
    "we follow the procedure proposed in ref .  @xcite , which is based on the @xmath41 scaling of physical quantities . using the fact that @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath42 and the chiral condensate to @xmath41 , we rescale the three - color values by factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "namely , we choose the model parameters such as to reproduce the values @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 mev .",
    "let us now turn to the choice of the regularization scheme .",
    "one possibility is to introduce a form factor @xmath48 such that    @xmath49    in fact , most of the studies of the effect of magnetic fields within njl - type models that include color pairing interactions are based on this kind of regularization ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as for the explicit form of the regularization function one might , in principle ,",
    "be tempted to use a simple step function @xmath50 .",
    "it is known , however , that this procedure introduces strong unphysical oscillations in the behavior of different quantities as functions of the magnetic field .",
    "a discussion on this can be found in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was also observed that the use of smooth regulator functions improve the situation .",
    "in fact , this allows to identify possible physical oscillations appearing in some cases  @xcite .",
    "different smooth form factors have been used in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite lorentzian functions of the form    @xmath51^{-1}~ , \\label{lorn}\\ ] ]    have been used .",
    "alternatively , in ref .",
    "@xcite , wood - saxon type form factors like    @xmath52^{-1}~ , \\label{wsalpha}\\ ] ]    were introduced . note that the form - factor in the above expressions is chosen in such a way that that three - momentum cutoff is used concomitant with the introduction of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , note that the limit of @xmath53 reproduces the usual three - momentum cutoff in the simpler case of a step function regularization . but due to the aforementioned problem with this regularization , it has motivated these other forms of regularization in the literature .",
    "it should also be noted that all these form factors include a constant that regulates its smoothness . to choose the values for such constant one",
    "is limited by the fact that a too steep function leads to the unphysical oscillations already mentioned , while a too smooth function leads to values of the quark condensate in the absence of the magnetic field that are quite above the phenomenological range .",
    "thus , the value @xmath54 is usually chosen in the case of the lorenztian form factor , while @xmath55 is taken for the case of wood - saxon one . in the following , we will identify these two regularizations cases as lor5 and ws0.05 , respectively .    an alternative way to regularize the finite @xmath56 thermodynamic potential",
    "was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . within this procedure ,",
    "the terms in the thermodynamic potential that are explicitly dependent on the magnetic field turn out to be finite and , thus , only those terms that are independent of it need to be regularized . in a way , this so - called",
    " magnetic field independent regularization \" ( mfir ) can be considered as an extension of the method described in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite to the case in which color pairing interactions are present .    following the regularization procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , after summing and subtracting convenient terms , the thermodynamic potential eq .",
    "( [ omega0b ] ) can be cast into the form ( see also app .",
    "[ subtr ] for details )    @xmath57    where    @xmath58\\ , , \\label{fz}\\ ] ]    and @xmath59 . in this expression ,",
    "a three - dimensional sharp cutoff @xmath36 can be introduced to regularize @xmath29 , which has no explicit magnetic field dependence , while the other terms are ultraviolet finite .",

    "@xcite give a very simple approximate analytic expression for the position of the bec - bcs crossover ( see , for instance , eq .",

    "in this work we studied the effect of the application of an external magnetic field on the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the model considered was the two - color njl with diquark interactions .",
    "when including magnetic fields , special attention has to be paid to the regularization scheme used .",
    "we have considered in our studies three forms of regularization : one with the lorenztian form factor ( lor5 ) , another one using a wood - saxon form factor ( ws0.05 ) and a recently studied regularization procedure ( mfir ) in which the contributions that are explicitly dependent on the magnetic field are finite and , thus , do not require to be regularized . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite in the two - flavor njl model and also here when a diquark interaction term is included , the mfir scheme fully prevents unphysical oscillatory behavior from appearing in the physical quantities , like in the condensates and in the critical chemical potentials .",
    "our results show that there is an imc effect in the critical chemical potential for the bec transition for diquark condensation .",
    "this is clearly observed for magnetic fields in the range @xmath76 .",
    "the critical chemical potential decreases during the imc by at most @xmath77 , favoring the bec transition . for larger values of the magnetic field , only magnetic catalysis",
    "is observed , requiring larger chemical potentials for the diquark condensation . with the further increase of the chemical potential , the system reaches the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the corresponding critical chemical potential is very weakly affected by the magnetic field up to values @xmath78 .",
    "there is still an imc happening also for the crossover , but the phenomenon is much weaker than the one seen in the bec transition with diquark condensation . the critical chemical potential for the crossover decreases at most by only @xmath79 . for larger magnetic fields , @xmath80",
    ", the bec - bcs crossover does however exhibit a magnetic catalysis effect .",
    "thus , strong magnetic fields tend to strengthen the bec region , once the difference @xmath81 becomes positive at a higher value of @xmath73 .",

    "<S> the bec - bcs crossover for a njl model with diquark interactions is studied in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid to different regularization schemes used in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> a thorough comparison of results is performed for the case of a cold and magnetized two - color njl model . according to our results , </S>",
    "<S> the critical chemical potential for the bec transition exhibits a clear inverse magnetic catalysis effect for magnetic fields in the range @xmath0 . as for the bec - bcs crossover , the corresponding critical chemical potential is very weakly sensitive to magnetic fields up to @xmath1 , showing a much smaller inverse magnetic catalysis as compared to the bec transition , and displays a strong magnetic catalysis from this point on . </S>"
