    "strangeness has been introduced into dense matter , at supranuclear densities , in many ways .",
    "most simply , strange quarks have been included in quark seas making up the neutron star .",
    "this seems energetically favorable , since introducing strange quarks can relieve the high fermi energies of the nonstrange quarks @xcite .",
    "bethe , brown and cooperstein @xcite pointed out that such efforts gave a transition from hadrons to quarks at much too low a density , because confining forces were left out in the quark sector . although we now believe that chiral restoration in the up and down quarks takes place at @xmath6 @xcite , the strange quark condensate exists until substantially higher densities , so it is more appropriate to use the hadron language for strange hadrons at densities @xmath7 which we discuss here .",
    "breaking of strangeness takes only a fraction of a second , so that in astrophysics there is sufficient of time for it except in the initial bounce of a collapsing star , where dynamical times are @xmath8 millisecond . following the bounce the compact core of a large star goes through a period of kelvin - helmholtz contraction , heating up as the trapped neutrinos in the interior",
    "diffuse out of the core , leaving most of the energy in the core as heat . in the few seconds",
    "in which enough of the trapped neutrinos leave , so that the phase transitions we discuss below can take place , the temperature increases to @xmath9 mev .",
    "the strange particles @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 carry negative charge .",
    "thus , as the chemical potential @xmath10 goes up with increasing density , it becomes favorable to replace electrons by strange particles , really the negative charge being the important quantity .",
    "given linear , in density , extrapolation from nuclear matter density , it is clear that @xmath3 baryons will quickly come in .",
    "in fact , @xmath11 s generally enter first , but since they carry no charge , they effectively change only little the behavior of the predominantly neutron star .",
    "the @xmath3 can replace both neutron and electron .",
    "it comes in at the density @xmath12 where @xmath13 in this case a @xmath3 at rest replaces a neutron at the top of its fermi sea , with fermi momentum @xmath14 mev for @xmath7 and an electron .",
    "it proves convenient to regard the @xmath3-particle , neutron - hole as an excitation , as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ]    nowadays nobody makes the naive extrapolation in density we now outline , but in a schematic way it represents the chief features of what goes on . with @xmath14 mev",
    "( at @xmath15 ) and with chiral restoration at a density @xmath16 , all of the nucleon mass here comes from the explicit chiral symmetry breaking through the low quark masses @xcite @xmath17 mev , the neutron energy at the top of its fermi sea is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vector potential felt by the neutron . for @xmath20 , @xmath21 mev in the linear walecka model @xcite",
    "thus , with a linear extrapolation to @xmath22 , @xmath23 mev . from this",
    "it is clear that the condition eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is met at a density @xmath24 , generally for @xmath2 , even in more complete theories .",
    "two points have been made clear by our model :    1 .   the @xmath25 excitation has a high momentum , @xmath26 mev at @xmath7 .",
    "it s predominantly the vector mean field which pushes the neutron energy up towards @xmath27 ( and beyond in our schematic model ) .",
    "now , two agencies operate so as to reduce the vector mean field at high densities , one simple and well understood , the other somewhat tentative and not yet well understood .",
    "firstly , rescattering corrections reduce a highly repulsive interaction in many - body theory , essentially through screening .",
    "thus , the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculation @xcite , although consistent with the walecka model for @xmath28 , reduces the vector mean field by a factor @xmath29 for @xmath7 . as can immediately be seen , this moves the possible participation of @xmath3-hyperons from @xmath2 to @xmath15 , and this is why we discuss this latter density .",
    "the second point has to do with chiral restoration , basically asymptotic freedom , and is not well understood .",
    "thus , what we outline should be considered as tentative .    based on @xcite ( which is certainly viewed in the community as controversial ) , for @xmath22 we are slightly beyond the critical density @xmath12 for chiral restoration .",
    "this means that in the chiral limit ( bare quark masses zero ) the nucleon effective mass is zero .",
    "thus , nucleons behave as massless particles , interact via vector potentials . in any case ,",
    "nucleon flow in heavy ion collisions is determined chiefly by the vector interactions . from the flow we can try to deduce the magnitude of these interactions , in particular , from au@xmath30au collisions at 1 gev / nucleon carried out at gsi @xcite .",
    "two groups @xcite have been working to deduce the vector mean field from the data .",
    "this is not simple to do , because the heavy - ion collisions are very nonequilibrium and large explicitly momentum - dependent corrections must be made before one deduce the vector mean field .",
    "still , the two groups are in general agreement . the more complete work of sahu and cassing @xcite places the vector mean field @xmath31 below the dbhf one in magnitude at @xmath7 , namely @xmath32 mev at this density . that of @xcite places it slightly above the dbhf value",
    "note that this dbhf value is arrived at by standard rescattering corrections to the mean field extrapolated linearly from @xmath28 .",
    "empirically , as can be seen in figure  [ fig:2 ] , the flow in au@xmath30au collisions is already decreasing by the time @xmath33 gev . at this energy",
    "the transport calculation show that the density @xmath7 is reached .",
    "higher densities are reached at higher bombarding energies .    from the figure",
    "it is clearly seen that the flow decreases rather strongly above @xmath34 gev / n .",
    "sahu and cassing model this decrease by a vector mean field which goes to zero at higher densities .    since",
    ", in the transport calculation @xcite , densities of @xmath7 are reached for au@xmath30au at 1 gev / n and since , according to @xcite , chiral restoration has already occurred by this density , we interpret the decrease in vector mean field with increasing density as a manifestation of asymptotic freedom . indeed , from lattice calculations of the quark number susceptibility , at zero baryon",
    "chemical potential , it is seen that the effective vector coupling decreases by an order of magnitude  but does not go to zero  in going through the phase transition @xcite . in this reference",
    "it is made clear that the ( fierzed ) colored gluon exchange takes over from the @xmath35-meson exchange as the temperature goes up through the phase transition .",
    "thus , we have an effective vector mean field remaining above @xmath36 .",
    "one would expect the same general behavior with density , except that the decrease in vector mean field does not seem to be so rapid with density as with temperature .",
    "given the behavior of the vector mean field described above , we feel that the most favorable density for hyperons in nuclei is @xmath7 . as asymptotic freedom sets in at higher densities",
    ", the situation will become less favorable .",
    "in discussing interactions between the nucleon and hyperons , those from the exchange of vector particles should be straightforward . beginning with the vector dominance of gell - mann , sharp and wagner @xcite and continuing through the theories in which vector mesons are viewed as gauge particles of hidden symmetries @xcite , the @xmath35-meson",
    "is coupled to the baryon number in nonstrange quarks , and the @xmath37-meson by su(3 ) symmetry , simply related to the @xmath35-coupling ( @xmath38 ) .    in the case of the scalar @xmath39-meson ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the scalar attraction which binds nuclei results from an enhancement , through scalar interactions , of two - pion exchange , the two pions being correlated in a relative s - state . for nucleon - hyperon interactions , correlated @xmath40 states also enter , becoming relatively more important as the strangeness of the hyperon increases .",
    "the correlated @xmath41 or @xmath40 interactions are shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the scalar interactions have been calculated for many years now in the case of the nucleon - nucleon potential , and are well understood .",
    "recently , the calculation of the nucleon - hyperon interaction by boson exchange has been taken up by the jlich group @xcite .",
    "coupling constants of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 to nucleons and hyperons are determined by su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "energy denominators etc . are taken empirically and involve a lot of su(3 ) symmetry breaking , arising chiefly from the relatively large strange quark mass @xmath44 mev , which results in the large kaon mass @xmath45 mev .",
    "the large kaon mass means that kaon exchange is somewhat suppressed with respect to pion exchange , so there is no simple rule , as in the case of vector meson exchange , for obtaining the couplings of the effective @xmath39 by quark counting .",
    "none the less , there is an effective symmetry , which we can discover by removing the explicit symmetry breaking in the meson propagators , the wavy lines in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "let us consider how the kaon mass diminishes the kaon exchange in processes such as shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the kaon propagator is @xmath46 we neglect recoil , setting @xmath47 .",
    "( since off - diagonal matrix elements like @xmath48 in intermediate energy states are involved , this may be an even cruder approximation than in the case of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . ) now @xmath49 will be limited by the form factor , which generally has a scale of @xmath50 gev @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the @xmath52 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) should be an @xmath53 25% effect .",
    "given that two meson exchanges are involved in the interaction , the explicit chiral symmetry breaking through the presence of the kaon mass in the denominators roughly estimated to be an @xmath54 effect .",
    "of course there is further chiral symmetry breaking in the  blob \" in figure  [ fig:3 ] , which we neglect .    ",
    "@l@cccc & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 + full model & 5.87 & 2.82 & 2.58 & 1.19 + @xmath59 & 1.00 & 1.02 & 1.52 & 0.84 + 1.5 @xmath59 & 1.50 & 1.53 & 2.28 & 1.26 + full model@xmath60 & 6.52 & 3.33 & 3.34 & 1.61 +    the most extensive meson exchange analyses have been performed by reuber@xcite .",
    "we show these in table  [ tab:1 ] , where the full model calculations are shown , also those from correlated @xmath40 exchange .",
    "note that the latter become more important with increasing strangeness , a fact that will turn out to be most important .    in the last row here",
    "we have tried to reconstruct what the interactions would be were the kaon mass equal to zero .",
    "in fact , with our coupling of the vector interactions to the baryon number in nonstrange quarks , the @xmath56 coupling shown in table  [ tab:1 ] is unsatisfactory . in order to reproduce the known @xmath11 binding energy in heavy hypernuclei , ma et al .",
    "@xcite had to use a ratio of @xmath61 of @xmath62 instead of the @xmath63 we propose .",
    "if the @xmath63 is used , then the @xmath56 coupling must be increased to @xmath64 ( in @xcite the @xmath56 coupling is 0.619 . )",
    "we do not know the underlying origin of this , but the evidence of this larger @xmath56 coupling is persuasive .",
    "( the @xmath11 binding energies only determine the ratio of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "thus , phenomenology does not give a clue to whether @xmath66 is large or small , unless @xmath67 is fixed by theory , or vice versa . )",
    "our theme is that the explicit symmetry breaking by the kaon mass decreases the @xmath57 coupling more than the @xmath56 one , and proportionately decreases the @xmath58 coupling , so that roughly @xmath68 certainly valid to within the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "( remember that the interactions go with the square of the coupling constant . ) in figure  [ fig:4 ] we show the @xmath3-potential which would be obtained from the parameters in table  11 of @xcite .",
    "the repulsive potentials result from the density - dependent optical model potentials which the authors of @xcite favor .",
    "the density dependent potentials give a strong repulsion at @xmath7 .",
    "extrapolation to these high densities may not be warranted . in any case , the repulsions sum to rule out @xmath3-hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "we suggest , on the basis of our reconstruction of the interaction in the chiral limit that at least some of the difference between @xmath11 and @xmath3 couplings derives from the explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "emulsion data , summarized in @xcite , showed a consistency for a @xmath69-nucleus potential depth of @xmath70 mev attraction .",
    "this has recently been challenged by kek quasifree production of the @xmath69 in @xmath71c where it is claimed that the potential , still attractive , is perhaps shallower , down to @xmath72 mev . in balberg and gal @xcite , the @xmath72 mev was assumed . with this assumption",
    "the cascade particle replaced the @xmath3 rather rapidly as a function of density .",
    "the results in table  [ tab:1 ] disfavor the @xmath4 as compared with the @xmath3 in that the attraction is smaller , cut down by a factor @xmath73 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) ) .",
    "the role played by the @xmath4 is uncertain , since its interaction with nucleons is not pinned down well empirically .",
    "the attraction resulting from the partial restoration of explicit chiral symmetry breaking felt by kaons in nuclear matter was a surprise when first presented by kaplan and nelson @xcite .",
    "it was recently argued by brown and rho @xcite that at supranuclear densities , this attractive scalar field could be considered to be the same sort of scalar field we considered in section 2 between nuclear matter and the nonstrange antiquark in the kaon .",
    "the difference from hyperonic interaction in dense matter is that for the @xmath0-meson , composed of up - antiquark and strange quark , the vector interaction , because of g - parity , gives an attractive interaction on the nonstrange antiquark .",
    "thus , the scalar and vector interactions add in magnitude , both furnishing attraction .",
    "clearly this attraction is expected to be large in magnitude .",
    "much has been written about @xmath0-nuclear matter interactions , and has most recently been summarized in @xcite .",
    "important experimental results have recently been published by the kaos collaboration . in ni@xmath30ni at 1.8 gev , densities up to @xmath74 are reached .",
    "( the precise density depends , of course , on the mean field used in the transport calculations , so even this is somewhat model dependent . )",
    "results for subthreshold @xmath0-production are shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the mean fields used to calculate in - medium effects are shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "there is general agreement between the theoretical groups of @xcite and that of cassing et al .",
    "@xcite on the fits to the @xmath0-spectra . in a footnote in @xcite",
    "the @xmath0-mass drops slightly more rapidly than in our figure  [ fig:5 ] ( although uncertainties are emphasized there ) .",
    "the kaos experiments are particularly useful in investigation of mean field effects .",
    "the @xmath0-production would be 235 mev below threshold for 1.8 a gev ni@xmath30ni , whereas a mean field such as produces @xmath75 shown in our figure  [ fig:5 ] would put the production locally at threshold at the @xmath74 density formed in central collisions .",
    "the extrapolation of the curve from @xmath76 to @xmath77 is not determined by the present experiments , but will be checked by subthreshold @xmath0-production in au@xmath30au collisions , which do reach @xmath7 and which are now going on .",
    "note that the subthreshold kaon production is insensitive to the low densities involved in @xmath0-atoms and do not bear on the results of friedman , gal and batty @xcite .",
    "a dramatic result of medium effects is shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] , where the ratio of @xmath78 production , each chosen at an energy which would be 235 mev below threshold in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "it is seen that this ratio is changed by an order of magnitude by medium effects .",
    "this is because the @xmath79-meson experiences scalar and vector mean fields of opposite sign , which tend to cancel each other .",
    "now the electron chemical potential @xmath80 is @xmath81 mev at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "as soon as the @xmath0-mass drops down to @xmath80 , kaons will replace electrons in neutron stars , with many dramatic consequences , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "there have been many articles in the literature , most recently ref .",
    "@xcite , saying that the introduction of hyperons early in density precludes kaon condensation by lowering the electron chemical potential .",
    "whereas it is clear that the two schemes are somewhat competitive , one should realize that at the temperature involved in stars , @xmath9 mev , all normal modes with electron charge will be excited with appropriate boltzmann factors .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath3neutron hole ( @xmath25 ) interact , except at momentum @xmath82 , and one should diagonalize these excitations in order to find the normal mode , the kaesobar @xcite .",
    "we show this construction in figure  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "lines i and ii represent the lowest possible @xmath3-particle - neutron - hole branches corresponding to @xmath83 mev , 0 mev , respectively .",
    "the solid lines are the lowest possible kaesobars which follow the minimum energy solution between @xmath0 and the @xmath3-particle - neutron - hole branch .",
    "here we used @xmath84 mev , @xmath85 mev , @xmath86 mev , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 in the meson exchange model ( see appendix of @xcite ) . in order to specify the @xmath3 potential",
    ", we used @xmath90 , 0.667 for lines i and ii , respectively .",
    "( for case i the full mean field potential felt by the @xmath3 , vector plus scalar , is 250 mev . given the mean fields @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 these @xmath94 and @xmath95 are what we needed to reproduce the two curves . )",
    "the value @xmath96 mev for curve",
    "i is taken from the least repulsive of the upper curves of figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "curve ii lies much lower , since we used 2/3 of the reduced vector field of @xmath97 mev on the nucleon but 1/2 of the very large ( attractive ) 700 mev scalar potential on the nucleon which is typical of walecka mean field theories .",
    "although curve ii lies much lower than curve i , we believe that such a scenario might result from theories which have the strong scalar attraction of walecka - like theories .    in the sense that the upper curve in figure  [ fig:8 ] follows from the least repulsive mean field in the extrapolation of empirical data @xcite , one might think that the @xmath3 does not enter in dense matter .",
    "however , scalar mean fields of the size we employed in case ii are needed for chiral restoration at @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore we have argued that the vector mean fields are substantially reduced from those of the linear walecka model .",
    "we offer case ii as a model which roughly incorporates this features .",
