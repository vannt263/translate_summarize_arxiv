    "weak approximation is an important technique instochastic analysis . a famous and classical result in this spirit is donsker s theorem which stipulates the following .",
    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "centered random variables such that @xmath1 , and define @xmath2 } \\zeta_k,\\ ] ] then the process @xmath3 converges weakly to a brownian motion @xmath4 . in particular , suppose that @xmath5 is a bounded continuous function , we then have the following convergence : @xmath6 \\to\\e\\bigl [ f(w_t)\\bigr].\\ ] ] similar result have been obtained for diffusion processes defined as solutions to stochastic differential equations ( sdes in the sequel ) ; see , for example , jacod and shiryaev @xcite .",
    "we also remind the reader that in this markovian setting , the value @xmath7 $ ] can be characterized using the heat equation from the feynmann  kac formula .",
    "backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes in the sequel ) , which were introduced by pardoux and peng @xcite , as well as the more recent notion of @xmath8-expectation of peng @xcite , are particular cases of so - called nonlinear expectations , and their weak approximation properties have attracted a lot of attention in the recent years . hence , in briand , delyon and mmin @xcite , the authors studied the convergence of the solutions of the bsde when the driving brownian motion is approximated by a sequence of martingales . in particular , when the brownian motion is approximated by some random walks , they obtained a weak convergence result similar to the above donsker s theorem .",
    "more recently , dolinsky , nutz and soner @xcite studied the weak approximation of @xmath8-expectation .",
    "since @xmath8-expectation can be considered as a sublinear expectation on the canonical space of continuous trajectories , by the analogue of donsker s theorem , they approximated it by a sequence of sublinear expectations on the canonical space of discrete time paths . extending bsde and @xmath8-expectation , the second - order backward sdes ( 2bsdes ) introduced by soner , touzi and zhang @xcite , can be represented as the supremum of a family of nonlinear expectations on the canonical space of continuous trajectories . in particular",
    ", it generalizes the feynmann  kac formula to the fully nonlinear case .",
    "we are then motivated to extend the weak approximation property to 2bsdes .",
    "we notice that the weak approximation property should be an important property of the continuous time dynamic models , when it is the continuous limit of discrete time models .",
    "for example , in finance , it is convenient to use a brownian motion to model the evolution of a risky asset , despite the fact that such a price only exists on discrete time instants .",
    "therefore , it is important to confirm that as we take the limit of the discrete time model , it converges to the continuous time model .    finally , weak approximation is also an important technique in numerical analysis ; see , for example , kushner and dupuis @xcite in the context of stochastic control problems , and dolinsky @xcite for pricing the financial `` game '' options .",
    "the main idea is to interpret the numerical scheme as a controlled markov chain system , which converges weakly to the continuous time system .",
    "we notice also that another point of view is from the pdes , which characterizes the solution of these dynamic problems in the markovian case . a powerful numerical analysis method in this context is the monotone convergence theorem of barles and souganidis @xcite . comparing to the pde numerical methods , the weak approximation method permits usually to relax regularity and integrability conditions , and also permits to study the non - markovian problems as shown in tan @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is to prove a weak approximation property for a class of 2bsdes , which can be considered as an extension of donsker s theorem in this nonlinear context .",
    "further , using some controlled markov chains as approximating martingales , we obtain some numerical schemes for a class of 2bsdes .",
    "in particular , these numerical schemes are coherent with the classical schemes proposed for the nonlinear pdes in the markovian cases .",
    "we also notice that these related numerical schemes have been largely tested in the previous literature ; see , for example , fahim , touzi and warin @xcite , tan @xcite , guo , zhang and zhuo @xcite , etc .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : main_result ] , we introduce the class of 2bsdes that is studied in the paper , and give first an equivalence result using two different classes of driving martingales . by considering a sequence of discrete time equations ,",
    "we give a general weak approximation result , that is , the discrete time solution converges to the solution of a class of 2bsde .",
    "then in section  [ sec : num ] , by considering some particular controlled markov chains , we can interpret the discrete time equations as numerical schemes , and the weak approximation result justifies the convergence of the numerical schemes .",
    "section  [ sec : num2 ] is devoted to some numerical examples , highlighting the convergence of the proposed numerical schemes . in section  [ sec : equiv ] , we complete the proof of the equivalence theorem , and finally in section  [ sec : cvg ] , we report the proof of the weak approximation theorem .    throughout the paper , we use the following notation .",
