    "_ combinatorial optimization _ is the seeking for one or more optimal solutions in a well defined discrete problem space . in real life approaches ,",
    "this means that people are interested in finding efficient allocations of limited resources for achieving desired goals , when all the variables have integer values . as workers , planes or boats",
    "are indivisible ( like many other resources ) , the combinatorial optimization problems ( cops ) receive today an intense attention from the scientific community .",
    "the current real - life cops are difficult in many ways : the solution space is huge , the parameters are linked , the decomposability is not obvious , the restrictions are hard to test , the local optimal solutions are many and hard to locate , and the uncertainty and the dynamism of the environment must be taken into account .",
    "all these characteristics , and other more , constantly make the algorithm design and implementations challenging tasks . the quest for more and more efficient solving methods is permanently driven by the growing complexity of our world .",
    "the _ matrix bandwidth minimization problem ( mbmp ) _ is a fundamental mathematical problem , searching for a simultaneous permutation of the rows and the columns of a square matrix that keeps its nonzero entries as much as possible close to the main diagonal .",
    "this problem is np - complete in general @xcite , and it remains so even in restricted solutions spaces @xcite , that is why any attempt to improve its solutions is beneficent .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to emphasize the effectiveness of using _ soft computing _ methods in order to solve the _ matrix bandwidth minimization problem_. _ genetic algorithms _ and _ ant - based systems _ are natural computing methods used in this paper in order to solve the _ mbmp _ instances .",
    "computational experiments confirm that these methods provide robust and low - cost solutions for the _",
    "mbmp_. we also introduce a new theoretical _ reinforcement learning _ model for solving the _",
    "mbmp_. so far , such a learning model has not been reported in the _ mbmp _ literature .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ mbmp ] briefly presents the matrix bandwidth minimization problem , emphasizing its relevance and also presenting existing approaches for solving it .",
    "the fundamentals of the soft computing approaches considered in this paper , i.e genetic algorithms , ant colony systems and reinforcement learning , are given in section [ bck ] . in section [ natcomp ]",
    "we propose two _ natural computing _",
    "methods for solving the _ mbmp _ instances , namely _ genetic algorithms _ and _ ant colony systems_. a theoretical reinforcement learning model for solving _",
    "mbmp _ is introduced in section [ prop ] .",
    "section [ exp ] provides an experimental evaluation of the proposed methods and section [ conc ] contains some conclusions of the paper and future development of our work .",
    "this section introduces the concept and the literature review related to the _ matrix bandwidth minimization problem_.      given a square positive symmetric matrix @xmath0 the bandwidth @xmath1 is the value @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix bandwidth minimization problem searches for a row ( and column ) permutation @xmath3 that minimizes the bandwidth for the new matrix .",
    "an equivalent form of _ mbmp _ uses the graph - theory approach , based on the _ layout _ notion .",
    "given an undirected , connected graph _",
    "g=(v , e ) _ , a layout @xmath4 is a bijection between _ v _ and @xmath5 .",
    "the bandwidth of g is @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , computing the bandwidth for a graph is to find a linear ordering of its vertices that minimizes the maximum distance between two adjacent vertices .",
    "starting from the given matrix @xmath8 , an equivalent graph @xmath9 can be defined and the _ mbmp _ can be viewed as the problem of minimizing the bandwidth of @xmath10 . in this graph ,",
    "the set of vertices is @xmath11 and two vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are connected through an edge _ iff _",
    "@xmath14 , i.e @xmath15_iff_@xmath16 .",
    "the current exact approaches devise algorithms that solve the general _ mbmp _ in @xmath17 running time @xcite .",
    "classic results for approximation approaches establish an approximation factor of @xmath18 for general _ mbmp _ @xcite and @xmath19 for trees @xcite .",
    "the _ mbmp _ arose in the solving systems of linear equation ; the ordering of the system matrix has great impact on the resources needed when actually solving the system , and may lead to a substantial efficiency increase .",
    "minimizing the bandwidth of a matrix helps in improving the efficiency of certain linear algorithms , like gaussian elimination .",
    "the _ mbmp _ current applications in computer science include vlsi design , network survivability , data storage .",
    "other applications are in electromagnetic industry @xcite , large - scale power transmission systems , chemical kinetics and numerical geophysics @xcite , information retrieval in hypertext @xcite .",
    "some generalizations of _ mbmp _ are currently investigated by the world researchers .",
    "for example , the two - dimensional bandwidth problem is to embed a graph into a planar grid such that the maximum distance between adjacent vertices is as small as possible @xcite .      the importance of the bandwidth minimization problem is also reflected by the large number of publications describing algorithms for solving it .",
    "cuthill and mckee propose in 1969 in @xcite the first stable heuristic method for _ mbmp _ : the _ cm _ algorithm with _ breadth - first search_.    marti et al .",
    "have used in @xcite tabu search for solving the _ mbmp _ problem .",
    "they used a candidate list strategy to accelerate the selection of moves in the neighborhood of the current solution .    a @xmath20 with _ path relinking _ method given by pinana et al .",
    "in @xcite has been shown to achieve better results than the tabu search procedure but with longer running times .",
    "lim et al .",
    "propose in @xcite a genetic algorithm integrated with hill climbing to solve the bandwidth minimization problem .",
    "a simulated annealing algorithm is shown in @xcite for the matrix bandwidth minimization problem . the algorithm proposed by tello et al .",
    "is based on three distinguished features including an original internal representation of solutions , a highly discriminating evaluation function and an effective neighborhood .",
    "more recently , the _ ant colony optimization _",
    "metaheuristic has been used in @xcite , @xcite in order to solve the the _ mbmp_.",
    "in this section we will briefly review the fundamentals of the soft computing approaches used in this paper for solving the _ mbmp _ , i.e _ genetic algorithms _",
    ", _ ant colony optimization _ and _ reinforcement learning_.    _ soft computing _ is the collection of computing branches that cope with the imprecision , uncertainty , partial truth , and approximation , manifested in nature and naturally ( and gracefully ) operated by biologic entities ( cells , organisms , or collections of individuals ) .",
    "the goal of soft computing approaches is to achieve tractability , robustness and low - cost solutions , facing the real - life , complex , highly - dimensioned problems .",
    "_ genetic algorithms _ ( gas ) , invented by john holland in the 1960s , are the most widely used approaches to computational evolution .",
    "genetic algorithms provide an approach to machine learning @xcite , method motivated by analogy to biological evolution .",
    "hypotheses are often described by bit strings whose interpretation depends on the application , though hypotheses may also be described by symbolic expressions or even computer programs @xcite .",
    "_ ant colony optimization ( aco ) _ studies artificial systems inspired by the behavior of real ant colonies and which are used to solve cops @xcite .",
    "the _ aco _",
    "methods use a set of cooperative artificial ants , each constructing a solution , based on the expected quality of the available moves and on the good solutions found by the community .",
    "_ aco _ demonstrated a high flexibility and strength by solving with very good results either academic instances of many cops or real - life problems . to improve the efficiency ,",
    "the ant - based algorithms are designed using problem - specific information and involve local search methods .",
    "the goal of building systems that can adapt to their environments and learn from their experiences has attracted researchers from many fields including computer science , mathematics , cognitive sciences @xcite",
    ".    _ reinforcement learning _ ( rl ) is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a numerical _ reward _ signal .",
    "the learner is not told which actions to take , as in most forms of machine learning , but instead must discover which actions yield the highest reward by trying them . in rl , the computer is simply given a goal to achieve .",
    "the computer then learns how to achieve that goal by trial - and - error interactions with its environment .",
    "in this section we propose two _ natural computing _ methods for solving the _ mbmp _ instances : _ genetic algorithms _ and _ ant colony systems_. the computational experiments from section [ exp ] confirm that these methods provide robust and low - cost solutions for the _ mbmp_.      in the following , a hybrid genetic algorithm ( _ hga _ ) is proposed for solving the _ mbmp_.",
    "the algorithm proposed in this section is a slight modification of the genetic algorithm integrated with hill climbing proposed by lim et al . in @xcite .",
    "let us consider that @xmath0 is the square symmetric matrix whose bandwidth @xmath21 has to be minimized .    in the _ hga _ we use ,",
    "a chromosome is a @xmath22 dimensional sequence @xmath23 representing a permutation @xmath3 of + @xmath24 .",
    "thus , a matrix @xmath25 can be associated to a chromosome @xmath3 , i.e the matrix obtained starting from the matrix @xmath8 by permuting it rows ( and columns ) in the order given by permutation @xmath3 .",
    "the fitness function associated to a chromosome @xmath3 is defined as the bandwidth of the corresponding matrix , i.e @xmath26 .",
    "the problem consists of minimizing the fitness function , i.e finding the individual with the minimum associated fitness value .    we have used the traditional structure for a genetic algorithm , adding a hill climbing step in order to quickly tune solutions to reach local optimum @xcite .",
    "_ hga _ algorithm operates as follows :    * at the beginning , an initial group of @xmath22 chromosomes is constructed , as it will be further detailed .",
    "* then , middle - point crossover and a @xmath27-swap mutation are performed on this group of chromosomes to generate new chromosomes @xcite .",
    "hill climbing is now applied to each newly - generated chromosome , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "as the number of individuals within a population remains @xmath22 , fittest chromosomes will remain in the next generation .",
    "after the new generation is formed , a swap mutation is applied on all chromosomes within the new generation , excepting the best one .",
    "then , hill climbing is applied again to each newly - generated chromosome .",
    "* step [ ii . ]",
    "is repeated for a given number of generations ; the algorithm stops and the best result is reported as solution .    the initial population for the _ hga _ is constructed as follows .",
    "starting from matrix @xmath8 , we construct the corresponding graph @xmath10 .",
    "then , the initial chromosomes are built by performing bfs on the graph , starting from each node .",
    "this way , @xmath22 initial individuals are constructed . applying hill climbing @xcite on the obtained individuals , the initial population for the _ hga _",
    "is obtained .",
    "the construction of the initial population for the _ hga _ is slightly different from the method from @xcite .    as further work we will investigate the appropriateness of replacing the hill climbing step from the _ hga _ with other local search mechanisms , such as _ pswap _ or _ mpswap _ procedures that will be described in subsection [ ant ] .",
    "a hybridized aco approach using a local search procedure is proposed in this section for solving the _ mbmp_.",
    "this local search method is designed to reduce the bandwidth of the current solution and is executed during the local search stage of the aco framework .    in @xcite _ ant colony system ( acs ) _",
    "@xcite is hybridized with a local search mechanism .",
    "_ model is based on the level structure used by the cuthill - mckee algorithm @xcite .",
    "the local search procedure aims at improving _",
    "acs _ solutions , by reducing the maximal bandwidth .",
    "the integration of a local search phase within the proposed _",
    "acs _ approach to _ mbmp _ facilitates the refinement of ants solutions .",
    "the main stages of the proposed hybrid _",
    "acs _ are as follows .    * first , the current matrix bandwidth is computed , the pheromone trails are initialized and the parameters values are established . *",
    "the construction stage consists of executing the next steps within a given number of iterations . at first all the ants",
    "are placed in the node from the first level , then the local search mechanism is applied .",
    "+ each ant builds a feasible solution by repeatedly making pseudo - random choices from the available neighbors . while constructing its solution , an ant also modifies the amount of pheromone on the visited edges by applying the local updating rule @xcite .",
    "+ after each partial solution is built , in order to improve each ant s solution , the local search mechanism is applied .",
    "finally , once all ants have finished their tour , the amount of pheromone on edges is modified again by applying the global updating rule @xcite . *",
    "the best current solution is listed .",
    "as illustrated above , the local search procedure is used twice within the proposed hybrid model : at the beginning of each iteration and after each partial solution is built , in order to improve each ant s solution .    in @xcite two local search mechanisms",
    "are introduced : _ pswap _ and _ mpswap_. the local search mechanisms are denoted by _",
    "hacs _ and respectively",
    "_ hmacs_.",
    "_ pswap _ firstly founds the maximum and minimum degrees .",
    "then , for all indexes @xmath28 with the maximum degree , it randomly selects an unvisited node @xmath29 with a minimum degree and then swaps the nodes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in order to avoid stagnation",
    "was introduced _",
    "hmacs_. first are found the maximum and minimum degrees .",
    "for all indexes @xmath28 with the maximum degree , it randomly selects an unvisited node @xmath29 with a minimum degree such as the matrix bandwidth decreases and then swaps the nodes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the experimental results reported in @xcite show that _ mpswap _ procedure performs better on small instances , while _ pswap _ is better on larger ones .",
    "in this section we investigate a reinforcement learning approach for solving the _ mbmp _ problem and introduce our rl model .",
    "let us assume , in the following , that @xmath8 is the symmetric matrix of order @xmath22 whose bandwidth has to be minimized .",
    "we define the rl problem associated to _",
    "mbmp _ as in @xcite :    * the environment @xmath30 consists of the set of states + @xmath24 extended with a state @xmath31 that is connected to all other states , i.e. @xmath32 . *",
    "the initial state @xmath33 of the agent in the environment is @xmath31 . *",
    "a state @xmath34 reached by the agent at a given moment after it has visited states @xmath35 is a _ terminal _ (",
    "final ) state if the number of states visited by the agent in the current sequence is @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 . *",
    "the transition function between the states is defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "this means that , at a given moment , from the state _",
    "i _ the agent can move to any state from @xmath30 , excepting the initial state .",
    "we say that a state _ j _ that is accessible from state _",
    "( @xmath40 ) is the _ neighbor _ ( _ successor _ ) state of _ i_. * the transitions between the states are equiprobable , the transition probability @xmath41 between a state _",
    "i _ and each neighbor state _",
    "j _ of _ i _ is @xmath42 .",
    "the rl problem consists in training the _ mbmp _ agent to find a path @xmath43 from the initial to a final state , i.e a permutation @xmath3 of @xmath44 that minimizes the corresponding matrix bandwidth @xcite .",
    "let us consider that , at a given moment , the agent has visited states @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath49 @xmath52 .",
    "starting from the path @xmath53 , we construct a permutation of @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "an element @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is computed as follows :    * if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 . * if @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 , then + @xmath64 . * if @xmath59 and @xmath65 @xmath61",

    "now , a matrix @xmath78 can be obtained from the initial matrix @xmath8 by permuting its rows ( and columns ) in the order given by permutation @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , a path @xmath79 of the agent in the environment corresponds to the matrix @xmath78 obtained as we have described above .",
    "as we aim at obtaining a permutation @xmath3 of @xmath24 that minimizes the matrix bandwidth , we define the reinforcement function as indicated in equation ( [ eq ] ) .",

    "@xmath86    considering the reward defined in equation ( [ eq ] ) , as the learning goal is to maximize the total amount of rewards received on a path from the initial to a final state , it can be easily proved that the agent is trained to find a permutation @xmath3 of @xmath87 that minimizes the bandwidth of the corresponding matrix @xmath78 .      during the training step of the learning process",
    ", the agent will determine its _ optimal policy _ in the environment , i.e the _ policy _ that maximizes the sum of the received rewards . during the training process , the states utilities estimations converge to their exact values , thus , at the end of the training process , the estimations will be in the vicinity of the exact values .",
    "it is proved that the rl algorithm ( such as sarsa @xcite ) converges with probability 1 to an utility function as long as all state - action pairs are visited an infinite number of times and the policy converges in the limit to the greedy policy .",
    "consequently , after the training step of the agent has been completed , the solution learned by the agent will be constructed by starting from the initial state and following the @xmath88 policy until a solution is reached . from given state @xmath12 , using the @xmath88 policy",
