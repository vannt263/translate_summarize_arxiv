    "the old cosmological constant ( cc ) problem@xcite is considered as one of the biggest puzzles in theoretical physics .",
    "remarkably , it is only partially related to the question of what drives the current accelerated expansion@xcite .",
    "in general the latter question is `` answered '' by the so - called `` dark energy '' ( de ) , which summarizes a large amount of different models and concepts@xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate for the de is a tiny positive cosmological constant @xmath2 , others are quintessence scalar fields , modified gravity , the existence of large scale ambiguities or even a misinterpretation of observations , just to mention a few of them .",
    "whatever the true answer might be , the old cc problem still remains in its full glory because we can not just put the huge vacuum energy predicted by every quantum field theory ( qft ) under the rug , and we can not just resolve the problem by mere fine tuning methods  cf .",
    "e.g.  the recent references @xcite and @xcite",
    ". in essence , the cc problem stems from the profound incompatibility between the observed de density@xcite with the theoretical expectations@xcite .",
    "one has to admit that theoretical physics is currently not able to predict the value of the vacuum energy density @xmath3 . in actual fact , this is not the main preoccupation , since after all qft is unable to predict , say , the value of the electron mass .",
    "the real problem instead is quite another one , to wit : while renormalizable qft does provide a fully consistent framework to accommodate the value of the electron mass ( namely , one which is free from uv and ir ambiguities ) , it is nevertheless unable to do the same ( as far as we know ) for the measured value of @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "we are left with various rough order of magnitude estimates of finite vacuum energy contributions , e.g.  from phase transitions and inflation , in addition to naive and mostly unreliable calculations of quantum zero - point energies  see however@xcite and references therein . in this untidy state of affairs",
    ", there is at least one single thing of which we can say that we are fully convinced to be true : that the huge contributions to the cc come from theories that work at typical energies much larger than those observed in the present universe , and therefore any practical mechanism is bound to start working effectively and efficiently already at these large scales , and then persist in the job for a sufficiently large period of time until our days .",
    "a promising dynamical route along these lines , i.e.  one which is free from fine tuning problems , is taken by models which intend to make a low - energy universe as ours feasible despite having a large cc in the total energy content . in refs .",
    "@xcite we proposed some intriguing models of this kind , where the machinery at work was called the cc relaxation mechanism .",
    "the resulting cosmos was referred to as the _ relaxed universe_. it is not surprising that these more innovative approaches require more invasive changes in the theory than just providing a source of late - time acceleration , as it occurs in the usual modified gravity models@xcite .",
    "while some of the latter are well motivated by observations , they usually presume the existence of an implicit ( and extremely fine tuned ) counterterm in the effective action just devised to cancel the big cc , such that the other sources ( matter and the new terms of the modified gravitational action ) can drive the acceleration on top of the essentially zeroed ( by hand ) vacuum energy .",
    "hence , even the most viable modified gravity models in the literature are in urgent need of some kind of cc relaxation that can avoid the unacceptable fine tuning of the vacuum energy which is implicit in all of them .",
    "the enormous difficulty in providing some form of solution capable to alleviate this acute problem plaguing all the traditional ( i.e.``late - time '' ) models of modified gravity gives a strong motivation to invoke new and unconventional concepts , with the understanding that in the beginning they might have the status of toy models or prototype ideas just hinting at the final solution .",
    "a serious hint along these lines might just be to replace the `` late - time '' modification of gravity by an `` all time '' ( i.e.  perennial or everlasting ) modification of it .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed a specific perennial modified form of gravity which provides an implementation of the cc relaxation mechanism at the cosmological level using the flrw metric .",
    "we found that the evolution of the universe is well behaved despite the presence of a huge initial vacuum energy density of order @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being the planck mass ) , in fact much larger in magnitude than the energy density of matter and radiation , thanks to the dynamical compensation of @xmath7 triggered by the expansion itself.cdm model .",
    "] the fact that this relaxation mechanism must be active during most periods of cosmological evolution ( actually , at _ all times _ after the inflationary period ) shows the intriguing nature of this approach .",
    "but it also explains the difficulty of generalizing the mechanism to more complicated systems , specially those that unavoidably involve the interplay of gravity and the matter sources . in order to understand better the properties of the cc relaxation mechanism developed in  @xcite , we investigate here its behavior on sub - horizon scales , actually on length scales fully in the astrophysical domain , e.g.  in the solar system environment .",
    "apart from searching for adequate metric solutions in spherically symmetric backgrounds , and dwelling on the physical interpretation of our model in different gravity frames , we will estimate the strength of the possible fifth forces . indeed ,",
    "in many modified gravity theories these forces appear as a manifestation of extra gravitational degrees of freedom  ( _ d.o.f . _ ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to obtain a qualitative understanding of all these effects .",
    "hence , we restrict the discussion to the special case of static backgrounds . at the cosmological level this corresponds to the de  sitter solution we found in  @xcite , which defines the border line between the quintessence - like and phantom - like behavior exhibited by our model in the future regime .",
    "consistently , we expect that the static solutions we deal with do not represent completely stable configurations .",
    "however , since we have found in  @xcite that the cosmological future can be very close to the de  sitter cosmos at the present time , we may nevertheless obtain useful information from the study of the static case without facing the full time - dependent situation .",
    "finally , we discuss some numerical solutions leading to possible deviations with respect to general relativity .",
    "the action describing our scenario is given by@xcite @xmath8+s_{\\text{mat}}[g_{ab}]\\label{eq : action - complete}\\ ] ] with the standard einstein - hilbert term @xmath9 , the matter action  @xmath10 and the large vacuum energy term  @xmath11 .",
    "the modifications to gravity are described by terms proportional to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the function  @xmath14 is given in terms of the ricci scalar  @xmath15 and the gau - bonnet invariant  @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding gravitational field equations follow from the functional variation of the action ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) . after a straightforward calculation one",
    "finds :    @xmath17\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the ordinary energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath19 is the extra tensor that appears as a consequence of the modified gravity terms .",
    "explicitly , @xmath20 we see that this tensor follows solely from the gravity modifications in ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) .",
    "if we set @xmath21 in it , then @xmath22 and ( [ eq : fieldequations ] ) boils down to the standard einstein s equations with non - vanishing vacuum energy density @xmath7 , i.e.@xmath23 . in the general case ,",
    "the field equations are rather cumbersome and we will have to consider different simplified situations .",
    "a working ansatz for @xmath24 is given in ref.@xcite , where it is then specialized to the flrw background and hence valid for cosmological considerations .",
    "in this domain , and for all epochs after the radiation epoch , it takes the simplified form @xmath25 which is the precise combination that reproduces the correct radiation and matter epochs through the cosmological evolution@xcite .",
    "therefore , this expression also applies for astrophysical applications , although in this case it must be evaluated for a metric amenable to the new context , typically a spherically symmetric one ( see below ) .    on theoretical grounds ,",
    "the initial cc density in the early universe should read @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 can be some gut scale near @xmath6 ) , and is to be taken much larger in magnitude than any other energy density .",
    "therefore , the  @xmath28 and matter terms @xmath29 in the action ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) are much smaller than @xmath7 . even if we take @xmath7 as the vacuum energy density of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , we have @xmath30 , which induces a very large cosmological constant , some 56 orders of magnitude away from the measured value @xmath31 gev@xmath32 . that ( negative ) contribution from the electro - weak phase transition",
    "is probably the most reliable number we can assume at the moment for the theoretical value of the vacuum energy , inasmuch as it represents the prediction of the sm as the most successful qft to date . according to our earlier work @xcite , the gravity modifications in ( [ eq : action - complete ] )",
    "can be used to relax dynamically the large cc and leaving a low - curvature cosmological solution which is not dominated by  @xmath11 .",
    "this is possible because the effective vacuum energy density in our @xmath33-cosmology  and hence the quantity playing the role of de in our framework  is _ not just _ the parameter @xmath7 , but the full expression @xmath34 , as one can see from ( [ eq : fieldequations ] ) . the effective quantity @xmath35 is dynamically enforced to be very small by the relaxation mechanism@xcite .",
    "if we focus on the relevant terms of the action which are acted upon by this mechanism , the corresponding field equations read @xmath36 solving this equation means that there is a dynamical cancelation of  @xmath11 by the @xmath37-terms in ( [ eq : eabfull ] ) .",
    "the remaining terms play no role for the relaxation because @xmath38 the details of the relaxation mechanism and various numerical examples in the cosmological context have been discussed at length in the comprehensive paper  @xcite .    for typical values of the @xmath12 parameters ,",
    "the @xmath39 term has little influence on the large scale cosmological expansion ( as we shall discuss below ) .",
    "therefore , the standard problems of @xmath40 gravity ( as e.g.  the incorrect description of the matter and radiation dominated epochs in these models@xcite ) do not apply in our case because at very large ( cosmological ) scales the leading term in the action ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) is not @xmath40 but @xmath41 , and we know that the latter works perfectly well since it is capable of relaxing the large cc and it correctly reproduces the standard radiation and matter dominated epochs  @xcite .    on small length scales , instead , it is the @xmath40 term of ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) that dominates , and therefore it will be this term that is responsible for the cc relaxation in the astrophysical domain . to better understand this behavior , let us study static spherically symmetric solutions described by the metric@xmath42 with two functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 depending only on the radial coordinate  @xmath45 . the time and angle coordinates play no role in the following . as mentioned already in sec .  [ sec : intro ] , static solutions on small scales correspond to the asymptotic de  sitter metric at the cosmological level separating the quintessence from the phantom future behavior .",
    "consequently , the static setup considered here is not expected to be absolutely stable .",
    "however , it may be a sufficiently useful approximation for obtaining some insights into situations not far to the de  sitter future . according to the recent observations , which prefer a cc - like equation of state for the de , @xmath46 , this a reasonable assumption .    in the general case , finding solutions of the relaxation equation ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) for the astrophysical problems can get quite complicated , so further approximations are necessary .",
    "the simplest situation that we wish to consider is the de  sitter , spherically symmetric , space - time .",
    "it corresponds to the form given in eq.([eq : sss - metric ] ) with @xmath47 thus representing a 3-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath48 , which acts as a cosmological horizon .",
    "such a space - time is an exact solution of ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) for all  @xmath45 , as we can check .",
    "let us indeed compute the extra tensor @xmath19 for the de sitter metric .",
    "first of all we find @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where we used ( [ brg ] ) to compute the latter .",
    "from ( [ eq : eabfull ] ) we arrive at : @xmath51 the fact that @xmath19 is constant confirms that the de sitter space - time is an exact solution . equation ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) can then be satisfied and so the expression ( [ eq : sss - e00-ds ] ) cancels against @xmath52 . as both terms with @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in general needed to cancel @xmath11 , they together need to produce the contribution of the sign opposite to @xmath11 . the straightforward way to achieve this for @xmath53 is to have both @xmath54 and @xmath55 , whereas for @xmath56 to have both @xmath57 and @xmath58 . finally , after imposing the boundary condition on the current value of @xmath2 , this fixes the order of magnitude of these parameters and @xmath13 need not be fine - tuned at all , we only have to fix their order of magnitude and sign  see equations ( [ recosmological ] ) and ( [ reastrophysical ] ) below .",
    "the relaxation mechanism then selects @xmath59 automatically such that ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) is fulfilled , irrespective of the input value of @xmath7@xcite ] .",
    "of course the cancelation is not exact , leaving a very small remainder ( the current value of @xmath60 ) , but the mechanism does not depend on it .",
    "let us emphasize that this cancelation involves no fine tuning because @xmath59 is not a constant to be fixed by us , but a dynamical variable controlled by the relaxation mechanism .",
    "whatever it be the starting value for @xmath7 , the relaxation mechanism chooses @xmath59 such that ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) is fulfilled . recall that @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 ) is driven to the current value of order @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for this dynamical choice stems from the late time epoch of the universe evolution , in which the relaxation condition ( viz .",
    "@xmath64 , without ever being exactly zero ) enforces a very small value of @xmath65@xcite .",
    "since @xmath59 becomes then very large , we see from eq.([eq : sss - e00-ds ] ) that the expression @xmath66 becomes also very large , in fact as large as to essentially cancel against @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the first term of ( [ eq : sss - e00-ds ] ) behaves as @xmath67 and hence dominates at very large distances ; this is the term that emerges from the @xmath41-invariant and which we used in the cosmological domain to insure a very small value for the measured cc@xcite .",
    "as we can see from ( [ eq : sss - e00-ds ] ) , in this domain @xmath59 is dynamically driven to satisfy @xmath68 , i.e.  effectively eq.([eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 where we have set @xmath70 .",
    "choosing @xmath71 we get @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ( gut / string scale )",
    ", we see that the required order of magnitude for @xmath74 is in the @xmath75mev range , characteristic of a light neutrino mass , and is also the energy scale of the cc : @xmath76 ev .",
    "the relaxation mechanism also works fairly well in the astrophysical domain .",
    "it only changes qualitatively , as we shall discuss below , where now it is the @xmath40 term of the action ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) that takes over .",
    "but the relaxation mechanism once more works appropriately to protect the astrophysical scales from unwanted vacuum effects . to start with",
    ", we note that the astrophysical domain can not be described by just the spherically symmetric de sitter metric ( [ eq : desitter ] ) ; we need the schwarzschild component too .",
    "let us therefore consider the schwarzschild - de  sitter ( sds ) ansatz with non - zero schwarzschild radius  @xmath77:@xmath78 in contrast to standard general relativity , this metric is not a solution of our system because the gau - bonnet term in @xmath79 induces an @xmath45-dependence in the extra tensor @xmath19 in  ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) , which can not be compensated by the constant value of @xmath7 .",
    "however , for sufficiently small or large values of the radius , @xmath19 is still approximately constant . to better understand this issue ,",
    "let us look at the extra tensor following from this metric . in the astrophysical setup , the invariant functions in the action  ( [ eq : action - complete ] )",
    "take on the form @xmath80 notice that the second term of @xmath81 in ( [ denomrb ] ) is the only new effect that the schwarzschild geometry introduces on the previous result for the de sitter case .",
    "the correction just comes from the gau - bonnet invariant part of @xmath81 in ( [ brg ] ) , which reduces to the square riemann tensor @xmath82 for the schwarzschild geometry , and induces the aforesaid @xmath45-dependence . from the expression of @xmath81 in ( [ denomrb ] ) , we see that in the limit of very large radius , @xmath83 , the leading term of ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) that implements the relaxation mechanism is still the @xmath79 one , and this fixes @xmath12 to be of order @xmath84 , as we have discussed in ( [ recosmological ] ) .",
    "thus , in this large scale regime the @xmath85 term plays no significant role .",
    "however , for local astrophysical scales the situation changes and then it is the @xmath40 term which takes over .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed discussion of the sds geometry is difficult . even in the case where @xmath13 is set to zero ,",
    "the field equations ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) for the relaxation mechanism become quite complicated owing to the @xmath45-dependence of @xmath81 . albeit this case",
    "will be treated numerically in section [ sec : numerical - results - betab ] , some qualitative considerations will be helpful to better grasp the behavior of the cc relaxation mechanism in the local astrophysical domain . in this simple context",
    "we can keep both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 terms .    from the structure of the extra tensor @xmath19 in ( [ eq : eabfull ] ) , one can see that the @xmath15 and @xmath81 invariants appear in the denominator of  @xmath19 with some powers , schematically@xmath86 with @xmath87 . ignoring the details of @xmath88 and @xmath89 we may use the simple form @xmath90 which should suffice to obtain some qualitative results . for @xmath91",
    "we recover the de  sitter result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sss - e00-ds ] ) , which is an exact solution . for smaller values of  @xmath45 ,",
    "the non - constant term @xmath92 starts to become more important and it will eventually dominate in  @xmath79 , specifically for  @xmath93 . in this region",
    "the sds metric is not a good approximate solution of ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) .    finally , for small  @xmath45 in the local astrophysical domain",
    ", we have @xmath94 and the influence of this term wanes in comparison to the @xmath45-independent contribution @xmath95 , which then takes over . indeed , for small enough @xmath45 , we find@xmath96 in the local domain @xmath97 , the tensor @xmath19 is approximately constant and the equations ( [ eq : sss - einsteineqs ] ) are again satisfied for an appropriate dynamical choice of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the sds metric becomes an acceptable solution for dynamical relaxation in this region , too . from ( [ eq : sds - r - small ] )",
    "it follows that the cc can be successfully relaxed in the astrophysical domain provided @xmath59 is dynamically driven to fulfill the relation @xmath98 , which again in practice means @xmath99 , i.e.eq.([eq:sss-einsteineqs ] ) . in any case",
    ", we conclude @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "compare ( [ reastrophysical ] ) with the corresponding result in the cosmological domain , ( [ recosmological ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath102 we get once more @xmath72 . in this case , however , for @xmath103 , the new ( astrophysical ) scale @xmath104 must be located in the mev range , which is a common scale for the sm of particle physics .",
    "it suggests a possible natural connection of the required order of magnitude value of the parameter @xmath105 with conventional physics .",
    "therefore , we could venture a possible natural explanation of why @xmath59 is so large , also in the astrophysical domain : it might be only because @xmath27 is much larger than the typical particle physics scales in the sm .",
    "if so , the hierarchy problem in particle physics could be linked to the hierarchy of vacuum energy scales in astrophysics and cosmology . far beyond the local astrophysical scales",
    ", we have the intermediate domain corresponding to the intergalactic and the intercluster distances , which is more complicated to analyze .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results - betab ] for a preliminary study of that cosmological intermediate region .",

    "_  is just one scalar field .",
    "furthermore , since our relaxation model is not just general relativity with small corrections , it is convenient to discuss the situation in more detail . in particular , we will cross - check our results by considering a direct expansion of the @xmath106 theory around a constant background and then identifying the new _ d.o.f . _",

    "this observation displays the whole dilemma of the old cc problem , and points towards a further completion and improvement of the relaxation model .",

    "finally , since @xmath191 provides the physical ( non - relativistic ) matter density in the jordan frame , we arrive at the effective field equation for @xmath134 : @xmath192 we may now compare the two source terms driving the evolution of @xmath134 , viz .",
    "@xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "if we look at the beginning of the quintessence regime ( @xmath195 ) , where @xmath196 , the first source is of order @xmath197 , whereas the second source is of order @xmath198 and hence much smaller owing to the additional suppression factor of @xmath199 .",

    "hence , matter does not disturb the relaxation mechanism .",
    "this is not surprising because it is related to the dominance of the curvature by the relaxation mechanism . indeed , if we take the trace of eq .",

    "the maximal coupling with matter appears when  @xmath214 saturates the slow roll bound , in which case the equation of motion for @xmath204 in the einstein frame can be cast in a simplified notation as follows : @xmath215 here , the mass  @xmath216 corresponds to that of the matter field @xmath204 in the einstein frame and contains the factor  @xmath217 .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : friction ] ) that this factor is shared by the fifth force `` friction '' coupling of matter ( @xmath204 ) with @xmath134 in that frame : @xmath218 .",
    "since the dimensionless ratio @xmath219 is independent of  @xmath199 , the relative strength of the fifth force acting on the matter field @xmath204 ( measured by comparing it to its mass ) is the same for all frames .",

    "even in the considered case , where the coupling of @xmath134 to matter is maximal , we obtained an extremely weak fifth force .",
    "therefore , we must conclude that such coupling is completely unobservable . into the einstein frame , @xmath222 ,",
    "then the tiny fifth force could be fully absorbed into a very small , unobservable , correction to the matter field mass .",
    "] it is also interesting to mention the effect of @xmath134 on photon interactions with matter . since the action for photons is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric , they are not subject to explicit fifth forces mediated by @xmath134",
    ". however , they feel the metric deviation in our modified gravity model with respect to standard general relativity . this effect might be detected by gravitational lensing experiments depending on the strength of the deviation .",
    "we briefly address this possibility in the next section .",
    "the large scale cosmological domain characterized by the flrw metric was studied in detail in @xcite , and we saw it is dominated by the @xmath79 term in ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) .",

    "we can not exclude the possibility that at intermediate ( intergalactic ) scales some non - trivial corrections to standard expectations might creep in .",
    "we provide some discussion of this possibility in the next section .",
    "let us return for a moment to the discussions made in sect .",
    "[ sec : spherical - symmetric ] .",
    "we have seen that while both at local astrophysical scales and at very large cosmological domains the relaxation mechanism works perfectly well and can be studied analytically , at intermediate scales our knowledge is more limited and we need to resort to the numerical analysis within some approximations , as we have seen in the previous section .",
    "the characteristic distance entering the potential deviations is @xmath230 where we know that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fixed in order of magnitude and ( same ) sign by the condition that the relaxation mechanism works in the cosmological and astrophysical domains , respectively .",
    "these conditions entail the relations @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "hence it follows from ( [ eq : rcritical ] ) that @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the mass of the galaxy or cluster of galaxies sourcing the gravitational field .",
    "we may compare this length scale with the one at which one expects deviations to the newtonian gravity at large distances in ordinary extended gravity theories , i.e.  with a late - time modification of the gravitational interaction@xcite .",
    "these effects have been specifically addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering a lagrangian modification of the form @xmath235 with @xmath236 the square riemann tensor . for @xmath237",
    "this is not far away from the behavior of the gravity modification in our relaxation model ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) at large distances , except that in our case we have both a gravity modification and the large cc in mutual interplay .",
    "it is however illustrative to compare the two kind of models for @xmath237 ) and also when a power of the ricci scalar @xmath15 is included in the numerator of the gravity modification in ( [ eq : action - complete ] ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "here we just analyzed the canonical , i.e.  the simplest realization of these models at the astrophysical level , and therefore we should naturally compare also with the simplest case @xmath237 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "] , for which the the characteristic scale of the induced modification of newtonian gravity is @xmath238 after setting @xmath239 , which is the extremely small value that is necessary to choose for the @xmath175-parameter in order to explain the late - time cosmic acceleration in this kind of models  @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the two characteristic length scales is @xmath240 for the numerical evaluation of this ratio we have used the source mass of a relatively large galaxy ( say , @xmath241 , i.e.  with a number of solar masses similar to our galaxy ) , or the mass of a large cluster of similar galaxies . in both cases the two length scales do not differ in more than one order of magnitude , so they are indeed very close . in other words , in both classes of models ( relaxation model and ordinary late - time extended gravity ) we expect deviations from newtonian gravity at similar large scales in the @xmath242 kpc - mpc range , as it follows from the above formulae .",
    "let us remark , however , that in the relaxation model we have a double bonus which is absent in the ordinary case , to wit : i ) we do not need to use extremely small scales as @xmath243 ev but rather scales @xmath244 mev and @xmath245 mev both lying in the natural sm range ( cf .",
    "[ sec : spherical - symmetric ] ) ; and ii ) the local astrophysical domain is protected from unwanted vacuum effects even in the presence of the large @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the typical value of @xmath246 emerging from ( [ eq : rcritical2 ] ) is roughly from @xmath247 to @xmath242 kpc in the case of a galaxy , whereas for a large cluster it may reach the few mpc level .",
    "as these length scales are at the same time the characteristic sizes of a galaxy and a cluster of galaxies , respectively , it follows that the local astrophysical domains remain well protected from large vacuum effects in our relaxation models .",
    "finally , in the intermediate region beyond these distances ( say up to @xmath248 mpc ) we can not study the problem in a simple way , as the numerical analysis of the previous section has shown , because the sds metric is no longer a good approximate solution . only after attaining very large distances ( of order of a few hundred mpc at least )",
    "we retrieve again the relaxation mechanism in the cosmological domain@xcite with all its phenomenological success@xcite .",
    "in this letter , we have performed investigation of the modified gravity implementation of the cc relaxation mechanism in a static and spherically symmetric background , which serves as an approximation for the study of the mechanism at length scales characteristic of the astrophysical domain .",
    "we found the mechanism to be working in the sense that the space - time curvature is not dominated by the initial large vacuum energy density  @xmath11 .",
    "instead , a small effective dark energy density @xmath249 is found , similar to our earlier results in a cosmological background@xcite . moreover , we studied the influence of fifth forces on massive objects , which turned out to be long ranged , but extremely weak and therefore inconspicuous .",
    "this shows that the idea of cc relaxation may be useful in more general contexts than just in cosmology .",
    "given the unconventional starting point , one could not naively expect this local astrophysical behavior from the beginning .",
    "interestingly , we also found that at very large scales of order of @xmath250 the metric may deviate significantly from the standard sds solution , thus opening up a possible way to detect this mechanism via gravitational lensing .",
    "possible observable implications at these scales have already been proposed in other modified gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "one can foresee deviations from the standard newtonian / gr behavior at length scales of @xmath242  kpc - mpc .",
    "we can not exclude , for instance , the possible implications of these deviations e.g.  by changing the required abundances of dark matter in the intergalactic domains in order to explain the dm problem in the large .",
    "however , the investigation of these potentially relevant issues goes far beyond the content of the present letter .",
    "their more precise description is therefore an important future challenge in the cc relaxation approach .",
    "finally , some theoretical issues remain open for further study ; in particular , the fact that the relaxation mechanism exerts such a dominating influence . in this sense , further insight should go into the direction of finding ways to complete this model and understanding the role of the vacuum energy versus the matter sources .",
    "quite in contrast to the present approach , the usual modifications of gravity disclaim _ ab initio _ any understanding of how to cope with the huge vacuum energy injected in the universe by qft / string theory , and just focus on late - time simulations of the measured effect . .",
    "a link between the two points of view is still missing , and hence more work is required to understand the ultimate interplay between gravitation , vacuum energy and matter in our cosmos .",
    "we hope that our approach may offer a new perspective for an eventual solution of this difficult problem .",
