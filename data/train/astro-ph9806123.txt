    "the hubble space telescope qso absorption line survey , a key project during the first four years of observations with the telescope , has resulted in the acquisition of ultraviolet spectra of a sample of 92 bright qsos .",
    "these observations have yielded valuable information on the properties of absorption systems at low redshift . in particular , they have allowed preliminary estimates to be made of the rate of evolution of the  absorption systems .",
    "discussions of our past results based on analysis of about 10% of the  absorbers in our data set can be found in our previous two `` catalog papers '' ( @xcite ; hereafter cat1 and cat2 ) .",
    "we have recently completed a significant expansion of the database available for analysis of the evolution of the  lines both in terms of the total number of lines available and in the range of redshift covered by the sample .",
    "this new database is described in the third of the catalog papers ( @xcite ; hereafter cat3 ) .",
    "we refer hereafter to the data set resulting from these 3 papers as the catalog .",
    "this new database makes it appropriate to describe in more detail the results , methodology , and limitations of our analysis of the evolution of the low redshift  absorption systems , which is the purpose of the present paper .    in two separate publications we will discuss the correlation properties of the  absorption systems ( @xcite ) and the inferences concerning the ionizing background radiation which can be drawn through the `` proximity effect '' ( @xcite ) .    during the past few years",
    "there has been a maturing of attempts to understand the nature of the  absorption clouds , evolving from rather simple idealized models ( e.g. pressure  confined clouds , gravitationally confined `` mini  halos '' , freely expanding clouds , caustics etc . ) to sophisticated numerical simulations which are able to reproduce many of the features of the  absorption in the context of the evolution of structure .",
    "the spatial and mass resolution in current simulations is still too coarse and the processes involving star formation and the details of galaxy formation and evolution still too poorly understood to allow detailed predictions of absorbers on sub  galactic scales within galaxies .",
    "moreover , simulations incorporating hydrodynamics are still so time - consuming that such simulations are just now being extended to zero redshifts .",
    "however , we are aware of one simulation which has been carried out to a redshift of zero ( but without a full hydrodynamic treatment ) at the level of detail and resolution so as to allow useful comparisons to be made between the data and the simulations ( @xcite . ) continued rapid increases in computing power should allow detailed comparisons between full hydrodynamic simulations and observations near zero redshift in the near future .",
    "( a comprehensive list of references to simulations and a discussion of some of the issues involved in the simulations may be found in @xcite . )    among the obvious and crucial areas for comparison are the distributions of line density as a function of redshift and rest equivalent width , and indeed this was one of the main initial goals of the qso absorption line key project .",
    "we hope that the present results , in conjunction with the wealth of groundbased data at higher redshifts , will serve as a starting point for such detailed comparisons .",
    "the organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows : in  2 we describe the subset of qsos taken from the catalog which are used in the present analysis . in ",
    "3 we discuss the applicability of `` line counting '' and maximum likelihood techniques to the analysis of the evolution of the  lines and describe the various parameters characterizing subsamples of the  lines used in our analyses . in ",
    "4 we present the results for the evolutionary rates for these samples .",
    "we discuss in  5 the distribution function of the lines as a function of redshift and of rest equivalent width ( hereafter rew ) .",
    "we also briefly discuss the corresponding distribution for @xmath7 column densities for an assumed doppler parameter .",
    "we give in  6 an alternative depiction of the evolution of the  lines by binning the data , and discuss the effect of adding lines from the single high redshift ( @xmath8 ) qso ( um  18 , @xmath5 ) for which we have a complete , though tentative , set of line identifications . in  7 , we ask whether there are differences in the evolutionary rate for  systems having , and not having , detections of lines which can be identified with heavy elements and investigate whether there is a dependence of the rate of evolution upon the strength of the  lines .",
    "we conclude in  8 with a summary of the results , a comparison of our results with the numerical simulations of @xcite , some implications of our results concerning the nature of absorber  galaxy associations , some speculations on multi ",
    "component  models and suggestions for further observations .",
    "some details of the maximum likelihood code used in our analysis are described in the appendix .",
    "in cat3 we present all previously unpublished spectra taken as part of the hst qso absorption line survey . however , for eight of the qsos ( all with @xmath9 , and including the highest redshift objects in the sample ) , while we were able to measure wavelengths and equivalent widths for the absorption lines , we have not yet produced a significantly complete list of line identifications based upon the rigorous identification algorithms presented in cat1 , cat2 , and cat3 . because unambiguous identifications become increasingly difficult for the increasing line density of the higher redshift objects , and because the decomposition of blended features in a unique way also becomes very difficult at these redshifts , especially at the relatively low resolution of our spectra ( 230270 ) , it is not clear if it will be possible to produce completely and securely identified line lists for this set of objects based upon our current data . for a ninth high redshift object , um  18 ( @xmath5 )",
    "we have managed to complete a set of identifications for the measured lines , but for the reasons just stated pertaining to the eight objects mentioned above , we consider these identifications to be less robust than the identifications of the lines in the remainder of the catalogue . for the purposes of this paper we consider the identifications for um  18 to be tentative ( see cat3 for additional discussion of the line identifications for um  18 ) .    for these reasons",
    "we have decided to summarize our conclusions concerning the evolutionary properties of the  lines based upon the completely identified line lists published in the catalog , not including the um  18 line list for the majority of the analysis .",
    "however , we do briefly describe the impact of adding this higher redshift quasar on the results .",
    "illustrations of all the spectra , the variation of the observed equivalent width of the line detection threshold as a function of wavelength , and the detailed line lists are all found in the catalog .",
    "note that in the present paper we only consider lines in the `` complete sample '' , which is defined to be those lines with a significance level , @xmath10 , of at least 4.5 ( @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ; cat1 ; cat3 ) .",
    "the significance level is defined as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the observed equivalent width , and @xmath13 is the 1@xmath14  error in the observed equivalent width of an unresolved line . note that @xmath15 is calculated with the flux errors at the positions of strong absorption lines replaced by the errors interpolated from the surrounding continuum points ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the significance level differs from the more familiar definition of signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath16 , because of the use of the _ interpolated _ error array for the calculation of  @xmath10 .",
    "as noted above , there are several objects in the catalog for which there are line lists , but not secure line identifications .",
    "in addition , there are a few objects which have deep broad absorption troughs ( balqsos ) and which have been omitted in the analysis of this paper ; these objects will be described elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , there are a few objects where the spectral coverage was such that no region shortward of the  emission line redshift was observed .",
    "these objects too , are of course omitted from the present analysis , as are all the objects which were only observed using the low dispersion g160l grating , which has a resolution of @xmath17 1100 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "there remain 63 qsos ( not counting um  18 ) whose  lines comprise the data set analyzed here . in table  1",
    "we list these objects in order of emission line redshift .",
    "column 1 lists the common name , columns 2 and 3 the 1950 coordinates , column 4 the emission line redshift , and columns 5 and 6 the lower and upper usable redshifts for detecting a  absorption line .",
    "the lower usable redshift is defined by the low wavelength cutoff of the spectral coverage , ( except that wavelengths shortward of 1218    were not considered . )",
    "the upper usable redshift coverage was set by the smaller of the upper wavelength cutoff of the spectral coverage and the wavelength corresponding to the `` proximity velocity '' cutoff , discussed in   3 . for table  1",
    "this cutoff velocity was chosen to be 3000 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "additional information about each of the qsos listed in table  1 can be found in table  1 of cat3 .",
    "in this section we describe the use of maximum likelihood estimators to obtain values of three parameters which characterize the distribution of the  absorption lines as a function of rew and redshift . from the point of view of the physical properties of the absorbing gas",
    "it would , of course , be preferable to know the distribution of doppler widths and h  i column densities , but at our resolution the lines are not resolved , so profile fitting is not feasible .",
    "although use of the higher lyman lines and curve - of - growth techniques would allow us to infer something about doppler widths and column densities for systems in which the higher lyman lines are observed , this subset of the data is substantially smaller than for  itself .",
    "moreover , blending of components could very well vitiate these results .",
    "additionally , at the observed line densities at the highest redshifts for objects in cat3 , not only do line identifications become more and more difficult , but , at the fos resolution ( @xmath0230270 km s@xmath18 ) , line blending becomes more and more severe , and the decision about when to decompose a given feature into several components becomes increasingly arbitrary  though reproducible  in terms of well  defined algorithms and reduction parameters ( paper  ii ) . more generally , some simulations call into question whether the concept of a `` cloud '' has much meaning . in this sense",
    ", it would be worthwhile to ultimately repeat our entire analysis based upon the flux ",
    "deficit method , as explicated in detail in @xcite . in both approaches",
    "the most difficult and least objective procedure still remains the drawing of the continuum .",
    "notwithstanding these shortcomings and the fact that we must deal with equivalent widths rather than column densities , we take the point of view that simulated spectra can be reduced and analyzed using the same techniques as the real data .",
    "direct comparisons between the equivalent widths in the real and simulated data can be made and the question of line counting _ vs. _ flux deficit is thus somewhat moot .    finally we have generally not attempted to evaluate the reliability of every line identified as  in the catalog , but have taken a line to be  whenever it was the first identification appearing in the line lists of the catalog , independent of any indications of blends or alternative , but less probable , identifications .",
    "the exception to this statement occurs where candidate c  iv doublets are identified shortward of the  emission line and when the expected position of the corresponding  is not within our spectral coverage ( or falls where the signal - to - noise ratio is very poor ) and when there are no other lines identified at the same redshift as the candidate c  iv doublet . in such cases",
    "the algorithms used for the line identifications can not provide an unambiguous identification and we had to make a subjective decision in selecting the preferred identification ( see  3.4 in cat3 ) .",
    "we have carried out simulations in order to estimate the probability that such c  iv doublets are actually chance pairs of  lines which satisfy the criteria used by the line identification algorithm to accept a c  iv doublet , and these simulations are described in detail in cat2 and cat3 .",
    "( a similar ambiguity occurs for the o  vi doublet , but in practice this has very little impact on the line lists . )    we have treated these relatively small number ( 46 ) of ambiguous c  iv doublets which occur in the line lists for the objects considered in this paper in 4 different ways : ( 1 ) regard all such possible c  iv doublets as being two  lines .",
    "we refer to the line list treated in this way as the `` maximum  line list '' assumption .",
    "( 2 ) regard all such possible c  iv doublets as actually being c  iv .",
    "we refer to the line list constructed in this way as the `` minimum line list '' assumption .",
    "( 3 ) based upon the probabilities for finding false doublets ( see table  4 of cat3 ) we assign probabilities to the identifications of being either c  iv doublets or pairs of lines . then , with a random number generator , assign each of these possible c  iv doublets to be either two  lines or a c  iv doublet on the basis of these probabilities .",
    "we refer to this case as the `` statistical  line list '' .",
    "( 4 ) we use the line identification appearing first in the catalog and refer to this as the `` preferred  line list '' .",
    "the maximum likelihood code used in the present paper is based upon the description given in the paper by @xcite but differs in a few significant ways . the formalism and these differences",
    "are described in detail in the appendix .",
    "the explicit parameterization adopted to describe the evolution is given in equations a-1 , a-2 , and a-3 of the appendix .",
    "we describe there also the determination of the distribution functions in redshift and rest equivalent width and the corrections for incompleteness .    in this section",
    "we define various ways of dividing the  lines into subsamples . the results will be presented and discussed in  4 .",
    "most of our results are contained and summarized in a table ( table  2 ) in which each row of the table specifies and contains the results for one of the subsamples .",
    "the columns of table  2 have the following meaning : column 1 is the number identifying the sample .",
    "columns 2 - 6 define the particular sample of  lines : column 2 gives the number of lines in the sample , column 3 , ( labeled rew ) gives both the limiting lower and upper rest equivalent widths accepted in that sample .",
    "the notation l , m , b in column 4 indicates whether the samples included : i )  lines in which there were no other lines identified with heavy elements at or near the redshift of these  lines ( l ) ; ( ii ) _ only _ such systems associated with heavy  element containing systems ( m ) , or ( iii ) both types ( b ) . by",
    "`` associated ''",
    "we mean that the  system in question lies within 300 km  s@xmath18 of a system ( most often the same system ) containing at least one heavy element ion",
    ".    in column 5 a `` v '' ( for variable sensitivity ) indicates that  lines were accepted regardless of the value of the 4.5 @xmath14 rew detection limit at the wavelength in question ( of course the line itself must exceed this limit to be accepted in the sample ) .",
    "as explained in the appendix , the incompleteness in the `` v '' sample is corrected for by the fit to the exponential distribution of rest equivalent widths .",
    "thus , the validity of the incompleteness correction in the `` v '' samples depends explicitly on the goodness of fit to an exponential in the distribution of rest equivalent widths .",
    "alternatively , we also define a `` u '' sample ( for uniform sensitivity ) , accepting only those lines whose rew is greater than some minimum value , but also limiting the spectral coverage in which lines are accepted , regardless of their rew , to regions having at least this minimum detection limit . in ",
    "4 we choose the value of this minimum detection limit in order to maximize the number of lines in the large `` u '' sample .",
    "we stress that the purpose of defining such u samples is simply to check that the values of @xmath3 we find for the v samples are not strongly affected by the assumption of an exponential distribution of rest equivalent widths . for the u samples ,",
    "the determination of the best fit for @xmath3 is independent of any assumption about the distribution of equivalent widths above the adopted minimum detection limit for the u sample .",
    "however this independence is achieved at the cost of significantly decreasing both the number of lines and the spectral coverage .",
    "column 6 is the `` proximity value '' cutoff : using the emission line redshifts given in table  1 , we calculate the wavelength corresponding to a doppler shift of @xmath19 from the emission line redshift , where @xmath19 is taken positive for wavelengths shorter than the  emission line .",
    "there are several reasons for treating with caution lines near the emission line redshift ( which is itself uncertain when it is not based upon lines from the narrow emission line region , as is the case for many of the qsos in table  1 ) .",
    "first , the ionization of the clouds may be influenced by the radiation field from the qso itself , and indeed quantitative analysis of this effect is now a standard tool to use in estimating the metagalactic ionizing radiation field , as is discussed for the key project sample by @xcite .",
    "however , there are at least two other equally important reasons : ( 1 ) in the region surrounding a qso , there is likely to be enhanced density , with an enhanced density of  lines , mitigating to some extent the ionizing effect of the qso (  @xcite ) ( 2 ) recent work  articles in a recent pasp conference series ( @xcite) clearly demonstrates that a significant fraction of such lines  perhaps the majority  are intrinsic to the qso .",
    "such absorption features  originally called `` associated absorption '' (  @xcite) typically have very high levels of ionization , and they are seen frequently in o  vi and c  iv in the key project sample (  cat3 ) .",
    "generally , their ejection velocities do not exceed 3000 km  s@xmath18 , and for this reason we have adopted this value in all the samples in table  2 except for sample 1 .",
    "however , it is also now clear ( @xcite ) that there are occasional instances of material ejected to very high velocities  presumably related to the broad absorption line qsos ( balqsos ) . in any particular instance",
    "it is not obvious whether a given absorption feature is truly intervening or ejected , and indeed , high ionization troughs in one of the objects in our sample , pg  2302 + 029 , is such an instance , as recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "columns 7 , 8 and 9 contain the results and are , respectively , the line densities at @xmath20 , the slope , @xmath3 , and the characteristic rest equivalent width in the exponential distribution , @xmath21 . also given",
    "are the 1@xmath14 uncertainties in these three quantities , calculated according to the algorithm discussed in the appendix .",
    "note that in column 7 , where we give the line density at zero redshift , we give the line density for lines above a rest equivalent width of 0.24   , using the value of @xmath21 given in column 9 .",
    "line densities normalized to any other lower limiting rew can be readily calculated by multiplying by @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "in this section we define several subsamples of the  lines and evaluate the maximum likelihood parameters for each . however , as discussed in  3",
    ", there is some ambiguity in the identification of a subset of lines which could be identified as either pairs of lines or a c  iv doublet .",
    "we defined in  3 four possible sets of identifications which we characterized as the `` minimum '' , `` maximum '' , `` statistical '' and `` preferred ''  line lists .",
    "as described below in connection with sample  2 , we conclude that the results are relatively insensitive to which of these line lists we choose .",
    "the first sample , sample  1 in table  2 , presents the results using the preferred line list . for each of the spectra of the 63 qsos of table  1 , ( except for the  lines identified in the high redshift object um  18 , which are not included and",
    "are discussed in  6 below ) sample  1 includes all  lines in the preferred list whose absorption redshifts are less than the emission line redshifts listed in table  1 .",
    "sample  2 shows the results of eliminating those lines within 3000 km  s@xmath18 of the emission line redshift : because there are relatively few such lines , their inclusion or exclusion does not significantly alter the results of these large samples .    in order to check the sensitivity of our results to the uncertainties in the line identifications noted above",
    ", we considered the same criteria for line selection used in sample  2 , but used the minimum , maximum , and statistical line lists .",
    "the results for @xmath21 and the line density differ only very slightly .",
    "the results for the minimum line list yield a value of @xmath3 of 0.08 , slightly flatter than for the preferred list , but by an amount which is only one half of the formal 1@xmath14 uncertainty in the fit . in the case of the minimum line list , for any given line of sight ,  lines in the preferred line list , whose identifications are ambiguous ( in the sense of pairs vs. a c  iv doublet ) are removed at the low redshift range covered by that line of sight , since the ambiguity is significant only when the  line which would normally be required to confirm the c  iv identification is at too low a wavelength to be observed at all , or is observed with very low signal to noise .",
    "this effect therefore tends to steepen @xmath3 .",
    "however the qsos in whose lines of sight these ambiguities tend to occur most frequently are those at the higher redshifts , and thus , considering the entire sample , it is the higher redshift lines which tend to be removed from the preferred sample , which flattens @xmath3 . for the maximum line list ,",
    "the results are in the opposite sense and we obtain a @xmath3 of 0.24 , again differing from the preferred line list value by only one half of the formal 1@xmath14 uncertainty in the fit .",
    "finally , the `` statistical '' line list gives a result which is close to , but slightly less than , the @xmath3 for the maximum line list .",
    "since all of these line lists yield values of @xmath3 which do not differ by more than one half @xmath14 from the formal uncertainty in the fit of @xmath3 , in the remainder of this paper we use the preferred line list .",
    "in  3 we described the use of a uniform detection limit sample , which avoids any assumption about the distribution of rest equivalent widths .",
    "sample  3 differs from sample  2 in utilizing such a uniform detection limit sample and shows that use of a uniform sensitivity sample also does not substantially alter the results for @xmath3 for these larger samples . for sample  3",
    "we chose the value of the minimum rew to be 0.24   , which maximizes the number of lines in the sample : if we take a value larger than this , we expand the wavelength coverage but restrict the number of lines , since their density decreases rapidly with increasing rew .",
    "conversely , if we lower this minimum rew further , we restrict further the wavelength regions having this more sensitive detection limit , and thereby accept fewer lines . in sample  3",
    "we have therefore set the lower limit of the rew for lines accepted in the sample to be 0.24    and thus also to regions of the spectra having at least this sensitivity . since there are significantly fewer lines , and more restricted wavelength coverage , the formal errors are larger than in sample  2 .",
    "as discussed in  7 it has been traditional to separate the  lines into `` lyman  only '' systems and those containing at least one heavy element line ( or `` associated '' with such a heavy element  containing system in the sense defined above ) . samples  4 and  5 are for v and u samples comprising just the lyman  only systems . once again , due to the fact that such lines are in the heavy majority , the results do not differ much from sample  2 .    the most striking thing about the results in the first five samples of table  2 are the very low values of @xmath3 which are much lower than was initially expected , on the basis of groundbased samples , when the key project quasar absorption line survey was conceived .",
    "these low values were suggested in our preliminary analysis in both cat1 and cat2 , but are now even smaller , are based upon a much larger number of lines , and now extend to redshifts of 1.5 .",
    "similar preliminary results , based upon spectra of two qsos of lower resolution and a very much smaller sample of lines , were obtained by @xcite .",
    "more recently , a preliminary analysis based upon archival fos - hst data has been presented by @xcite with similar results . at some redshift",
    ", however , we certainly expect an upturn in the rate of evolution if these results are to be compatible with the groundbased results .",
    "we return to this topic in  6 .",
    "the slow rate of evolution we observe seems in conflict with the visual impression resulting from inspecting the spectra of the qsos at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see figures in cat1 , cat2 , and cat3 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 qsos certainly appear to have many more strong absorption lines blueward of the qso ly-@xmath26 emission line than does , for example , the spectrum of the low redshift qso 3c  273 .",
    "three factors contribute to this impression .",
    "first , while the spectra obtained in the survey are of fairly uniform signal  to  noise ratio per resolution element ( about 30 ) over most of the wavelength coverage , this results in a lower _ rest _ equivalent width detection limit in the spectra of the higher redshift objects than it does in the lower redshift objects .",
    "moreover , redshifts from @xmath00 to about 0.35 are seen only in the g130h spectra , which sometimes have somewhat lower s / n than the g190h and g270h data , especially at the lowest redshifts .",
    "this results in correspondingly fewer lines at low redshift .",
    "second , there are more heavy element systems detected in the spectra of the higher redshift objects ( in part because of a larger number per unit redshift , but also because there is more observed path length at the higher redshifts ) and each of these systems can contribute 3 to 20 absorption lines to the spectrum .",
    "finally , the higher order lyman series lines ( ly-@xmath27 , ly-@xmath3 , etc . ) are more readily observable in the spectra of the higher redshift qsos , due to a larger observed path length and the more sensitive rest equivalent width detection threshold .",
    "all of these effects are evident in the spectrum of the @xmath28 qso pg  1538@xmath29477 ( see cat3 and figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate the rest equivalent width detection limits in figure  1 , where we reproduce from cat3 both the _ observed _ 4.5@xmath14 detection limit and the _ rest _ 4.5@xmath14 detection limit for typical spectra resulting from the 3 gratings used here . at a redshift of 1.5 , even for observed equivalent width limits",
    "which are comparable , the minimum detectable rest equivalent width is lower by a factor of 2.5 than it is at zero redshift . because of the fairly rapid decline in the distribution of  lines with increasing rest equivalent width , these numerous weaker lines are not detectable at the lower redshifts .",
    "all of these effects combine to give one the false visual impression of a rapidly evolving population of   lines .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath21 summarized in table  2 are based upon the assumption that the distribution of the  lines can be reasonably well represented by a power law in @xmath30 and an exponential in the rest equivalent width .",
    "since the effective path length in redshift space is affected both by the number of lines of sight associated with each grating , the distribution of emission line redshifts in our sample , and the variation in minimum detectable equivalent width as a function of wavelength for a given grating , there are significant differences between the observed redshift distribution of the  lines and the `` true '' distribution (  the observed distribution corrected for the non  uniform coverage in sensitivity and wavelength . ) the same is true for the distribution of rest equivalent widths .",
    "the observed distribution of lines in redshift and rew is shown in figure  2 , where we have also plotted the number of sightlines as a function of redshift .    in the appendix",
    ", we describe the algorithms used for making these corrections . in displaying the results we could",
    ", following for example @xcite , plot the cumulative distribution _ vs. _ the `` effective path length '' , in which the cumulative distribution function increases by an equal amount for every  line .",
    "alternatively , we could weight the lines in forming the cumulative distribution function , as described in the appendix , and plot this cumulative distribution directly as a function of redshift .",
    "the former has the advantage that a statistical test for goodness of fit ( @xmath31 the ks test ) can be rigorously applied , whereas the latter has the advantage that `` redshift '' is much more readily interpretable than `` effective path length '' as the abscissa .",
    "we opt for the latter case . where the data are sparse ( e.g. , between the redshifts of 0.31 and 0.35 corresponding to the region from 1600  to 1650    where the s / n is generally very poor  see figure  1 ) each line is weighted more heavily than in adjacent regions and causes a jump in the ordinate of the distribution function which is larger than for a line in a well  sampled redshift interval .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in figure  3 , it is evident that the power law fit to the data of sample  1 is a remarkably good one .",
    "the application of the ks test to the data displayed in figure  3 , while not rigorous for the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph , yields a probability of  36% that a ks statistic @xmath32 to the observed one would arise from a random sampling of true power law distributions with the same slope , thus confirming the visual impression of the goodness of fit .",
    "since it is rather unlikely that the evolution of such complex physical processes as those which produce  lines in qso spectra should be represented accurately by a power law , we do not pay particular attention to whether a better representation might be found  as always , our point of view is that the empirical ( but corrected ) distribution function is to be compared with detailed numerical simulations .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the distribution of equivalent widths . in this case",
    ", it is more instructive to compare the raw and corrected _ differential _ distributions in bins of 0.1   .",
    "this is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the fit is quite good .",
    "there may be a very slight excess of lines in the first bin , though this is not statistically significant .",
    "the fact that the exponential is a fairly good fit follows from the convolution of a power law in the distribution of h  i column densities over a range of doppler parameters , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since most simulations are presented in terms of the h  i column density , however , we make a very rough attempt to translate the results of figure  4 from equivalent width to column density .",
    "this requires knowledge of the doppler parameters which we lack .",
    "there is to date only limited information on the distribution of doppler parameters at low redshifts , but the existing data suggest it is not very different from that found for higher redshift systems . in figure  5",
    "we convert equivalent widths to column densities for a single value of the doppler parameter of 30 km  s@xmath18 , though there are clearly instances of lines having both larger as well as smaller values .",
    "the approximate slope of the differential column density distribution , @xmath33 is  @xmath34  at the low column density end , consistent with values found from high resolution studies at high redshifts (  @xcite ) . in figure  5",
    "we also plot the curve  of  growth for  relating equivalent width and column density for 3 doppler parameters ( 20 , 30 , and 40 km  s@xmath18 ) , and from these curves the influence of the doppler parameter upon the inferred column density distribution can be estimated .",
    "thus we conclude that the large samples are quite well represented by a power law in redshift and an exponential in rest equivalent width .",
    "there remains , however , the question of whether the rate of evolution might vary as a function of line strength or metallicity : we defer discussion of this question until  7 .",
    "as noted in  4 , at some point we should expect that an upturn should exist in the rate of evolution of the  lines deduced from the key project data if they are to match smoothly onto the results obtained from groundbased spectroscopy .",
    "there was some slight hint of this from the data based upon the smaller and lower redshift samples comprising cat1 and cat2 .",
    "however , when we bin the data from the substantially larger database represented by sample  2 , there is no convincing evidence for this up to a redshift of 1.5 , as shown in figure  6 . in figure  6",
    "we have divided the redshift space between 0 and 1.5 into five bins spaced equally in @xmath35 . within each bin",
    ", we evaluated @xmath1 at the middle of that bin , fixing both @xmath3 and @xmath21 to have the values for the global fit of sample  2 .",
    "( the resulting values of @xmath1 are very insensitive to the value of @xmath3 assumed since the values of @xmath1 plotted in figure  6 are centered between the limits of each bin . )",
    "figure  6 confirms the impression of a very flat rate of evolution over the range @xmath36 = 0.0 to 1.5 suggested by table  2 .",
    "the same procedure using the u sample ( sample  5 ) gives very similar results . in figure  6",
    "we have also plotted groundbased results from an early analysis by @xcite and more recent results by @xcite , based upon data which is similar to ours in terms of line density per resolution element in the region where the groundbased and hst data join .",
    "the slope found in that analysis was 1.85 .",
    "( a recent analysis based upon much higher resolution and signal to noise spectra using  lines above redshift two , and whose strengths are comparable to those in our sample yielded a steeper slope , @xmath37 ; @xcite ) . taken at face value ,",
    "figure  6 suggests that in the redshift range from about 1.3 to 1.7 , which bridges the gap between our fos data and the lowest redshifts available from the groundbased data , the rate of evolution increases rather abruptly .      while both the character of the data and the analysis in the bechtold data are not very different from our hst data and analysis , it would be preferable to have a uniform data set and analysis which spans this redshift range . in particular , adding  lines in the redshift range between @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the key project objects is very important , as it will fill in the gap between our currently well  identified sample of absorbers and the large groundbased samples that have been compiled .",
    "after the bulk of the analysis for this paper had been performed , identifications of the lines in the spectrum of one of these objects , um  18 ( @xmath5 ) were completed ( cat3 ) . since line blending and",
    "the location of the continuum start to pose significant problems in objects at these redshifts , at the fos g270h resolution , we must regard the line lists from um18 as considerably more uncertain than those for the other 63 qsos we have discussed .",
    "therefore , we have chosen not to include um  18 in most of the analysis .",
    "we have , however , run a sample identical to sample  2 in which all the um  18  lines are included .",
    "although um  18 has a large number of lines at redshifts below @xmath36=1.5 , the overwhelming number below this redshift still come from other lines of sight , and the inclusion or non - inclusion of um  18 lines at redshifts below this redshift makes no significant difference in either the global fits in table 2 or the binned data of figure  6 .",
    "however , when we extend the binned data to include the bin from 1.5 to 1.69 ( corresponding to 3270   , the red end of the g270h spectral coverage ) then the 19 lines contributed by um  18 in this region suggest a sharp upturn in the rate of evolution .",
    "the bin spanning this redshift range and containing these 19 lines is also shown in figure  6 . because of the small number of lines in this bin the upturn in the line density from what extrapolation of the data up to redshift 1.5 suggests is only significant at about the 1.5@xmath14 level .",
    "while it is thus somewhat reassuring that there is a moderately strong indication from um 18 that we are starting to see this upturn in our key project data , it will be very important to see if this upturn is indeed as sharp as suggested from the current data , as the remainder of the large number of lines in the cat3 line lists become reliably identified .",
    "evidently , the redshift regime between about 1.5 and 1.8 is a very interesting one for further study with both hst and with groundbased telescopes .",
    "given the wide range of physical conditions and processes which can give rise to observable  absorption , it would be somewhat surprising if the rate of evolution did not depend to some extent on various properties of the  absorption such as degree of association with galaxies , metal content , and line strength . in this section",
    "we discuss the latter two possibilities .",
    "it has been customary to treat the  absorption systems in which no other ions are found separately from those in which ions from heavy elements are detected .",
    "historically , this arose from the original suggestion of @xcite that the low column density lyman  only systems represented unprocessed material and formed a population distinct from absorption systems containing , e.g. c  iv .",
    "this idea was supported by the apparently quite different clustering properties of the two types of systems .",
    "the advent of very high resolution , high sensitivity groundbased spectra has cast some doubt on this point of view , since c  iv systems seem to generally be found at h  i column densities down to @xmath40 ( @xcite ) below which it has been presumed that the c  iv lines become too weak to detect individually . it has further been suggested ( @xcite ) that there is a `` floor '' in the metallicity of the  forest lines of order 10@xmath41 solar , reflecting perhaps general contamination from the first epoch of star formation . on the basis of the coaddition of a large number of weaker lyman lines ( in the h  i column density range @xmath42 ) though , it was found that the ratio of c  iv to  strengths become very much smaller , either because of very much lower ( or zero ) metallicity , or conceivably because of an abrupt change in the level of ionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , using a different technique , cowie and songaila ( @xcite ) find that the metallicity ( as judged by the c  iv/  line ratios ) does _ not _ drop at very low column densities ( and thus in regions of nearly zero over - density ) .",
    "the foregoing all refers , of course , to much higher redshift systems than in our hst sample , and , in view of the rather unexpected flatness of the rate of evolution of the total ensemble of  lines ( as reflected in sample  2 of table  2 ) , it is of interest to ask whether there is any evidence that the  systems in which one or more ions of heavy elements have been detected behave any differently than the lyman  only systems , insofar as their rate of evolution is concerned .",
    "we stress that with the sensitivity and limited spectral coverage of our fos data , _ the lack of detection of lines from heavy elements does not imply that these systems truly lack heavy elements or are even strongly metal deficient_. most , perhaps all , may well be found to contain weak heavy element lines with stis and/or groundbased resolution and sensitivity .",
    "thus , although we will continue to refer to this set as `` lyman - only '' systems , this should be understood to mean `` systems with no identified heavy element ions due to inadequate sensitivity or spectral coverage , or low heavy element abundance . ''",
    "the much smaller set of  lines for which heavy element ions have been identified at the same redshift we designate as lwhed lines (  lines with heavy element detections ) .",
    "we also include in this category the very few  lines without heavy element ions identified at the  redshift , but whose redshift is within 300  km  s@xmath18 of heavy element  containing systems , since it seems very likely that such systems are physically associated with the heavy element  containing systems . in defining the lwhed samples it is also crucial to exclude lines within 3000  km  s@xmath18 of the emission line redshift , since , as remarked previously , systems showing c  iv and o  vi near the emission line redshift are quite common and have a high probability of being intrinsic to the qso . in our total sample of  lines with v@xmath43 3000 km  s@xmath18",
    ", there are a total of 78 systems in which one or more heavy element ions have been identified .",
    "there are an additional five `` associated ''  lines ( as defined in  3.2 ) for a total of 83 which we place in the lwhed category . among these 83 , however ,",
    "are some found in the possible balqso pg  2302 + 029 which has broad weak troughs of o  vi , n  v , c  iv and probably and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "whether these troughs represent intervening or ejected material is not known , but if the troughs are interpreted as high velocity ejected material , then , since sharp components are often found to accompany the broad troughs , for the purpose of the following discussion we have dropped pg  2302 + 029 from the samples discussed in this section .",
    "there remain 79 lwhed systems ; the five `` associated '' systems and 74  lines having redshifts identical , within the measuring errors , to the redshifts defined by the heavy element lines themselves .",
    "although comparison of the large `` v '' and `` u '' samples  2 and  3 give quite comparable results , the smaller samples become increasingly vulnerable to the assumption of exponential fits to the equivalent width distribution .",
    "this is especially true of the lwhed systems , where the @xmath44folding rew , @xmath21 , is much larger than in the other samples . in samples  6 and  7",
    "therefore , we show the results for both the `` v '' and `` u '' assumptions for the lwhed lines . in the latter case",
    "we have chosen the minimum equivalent width cutoff to maximize the number of lines , and this occurs at a rest equivalent width of 0.40   .",
    "we find a very much more rapid rate of evolution ( @xmath45 ) for these two samples , respectively , than for the total sample because of the small number of lines the uncertainty of @xmath3 for the lwhed samples is now substantially larger .",
    "the median rew and characteristic equivalent width , @xmath21 , are also both very much larger than the full  sample .    because the median rews of sample  2 are significantly smaller than that of the lwhed sample  6 , we do not necessarily expect to detect heavy element lines in many of the weaker  lines of sample  2 , given the fos sensitivity , even if there were no significant differences in metallicity .",
    "one might expect therefore , that the difference in rates of evolution between sample  6 _ vs. _ sample  2 simply reflects differing rates of evolution between low and high equivalent width samples , and has very little to do with metallicity .",
    "it would not be unexpected that in a subset of the lyman  only lines drawn from the high end of the equivalent width distribution of the lyman  only sample , we would obtain a rate of evolution which was comparable to the lwhed samples , and we might then attribute the lack of detected heavy element lines in such a sample to , for example , the expected position of c  iv falling outside our wavelength coverage .",
    "it is not possible to find a sample of high rew lyman  only systems which exactly matches the equivalent width distribution of the lwhed systems and still have a sample of reasonable size .",
    "however , considering just lines in the lyman  only sample with rew @xmath46 0.70    ( samples  8 and  9 for the v and u samples , respectively ) we may compare the 0.25 , 0.50 and 0.75 percentiles in the rew distributions with the following results : for samples  6 and  8 ( the v samples for the lwhed and lyman  only samples ) the rews for these three percentiles are 0.48 , 0.80 and 1.09 _ vs. _ 0.74 , 0.83 and 0.99 , respectively , while the corresponding comparisons for the u  samples  7 and  9 are 0.63 , 0.89 and 1.15 for the lwhed systems _ vs. _ 0.74 , 0.82 and 0.99 for the lyman  only systems .",
    "comparison of the maximum likelihood values for @xmath3 in sample  6 _ vs. _ sample  8 as well as sample  7 _ vs. _ sample  9 shows that the lwhed systems seem to be evolving much more rapidly than the lyman  only systems , though the errors are large due to the small number of lines . utilizing the formal 1@xmath14 errors given in table 2 , we find formal differences in the rate of evolution of the lyman  only and lwhed systems exist at about the 2.2@xmath14 and 2.4@xmath14 level for the v  and u  samples , respectively .    recognizing that the apparent differences in rates of evolution between the lwhed systems and the high end of the rew distribution for the lyman  only systems are not highly statistically significant it is nevertheless of interest to consider whether selection effects might artificially give rise to this apparent difference . or , if the difference is real , what the likely interpretation is .",
    "since a detailed discussion of the properties of the heavy element systems in the key project sample will be presented in a separate paper ( @xcite ) , we will give only a brief and mostly qualitative discussion .",
    "there is one effect which might cause systems which we have considered to be lwhed systems to actually be lyman  only systems : accidental groupings of real  lines might lead to false identifications of metal line systems satisfying all the requirements of the line identification algorithm . as discussed in  3 , and in detail in cat2 and cat3 , when the candidate c  iv doublet is in the  forest , and when the  line which would be present at the same redshift as the candidate c  iv is beyond our spectral coverage , then of order 50% of these candidate c  iv systems may be spurious . substituting pairs of  lines for the c",
    "iv identifications thus increases by a few percent the total number of  lines in the total  sample ( and in the lyman - only sample ) , but , as discussed in  4 , has only a very small effect on the maximum likelihood fit parameters . altering the identifications of such cases does not change the composition of the lwhed sample , since , by definition , _ both _ heavy element ions and  must be present .",
    "however , the discussions in cat2 and cat3 also demonstrate that when a candidate c  iv system is found and when the  in the same system _ is _ accessible ,  when it is a candidate lwhed system , then the number of false identifications _ per spectrum _",
    "is very small .",
    "thus , given the total number of lwhed systems in samples  6 and  7 , it is unlikely that misidentification of accidental spacings of a very small number of  lines as heavy element lines significantly affects our results .",
    "conversely , one might also suppose that the lack of heavy element detections in samples  8 and  9 simply reflects biases in the spectral coverage , and that with much broader spectral coverage , but the _ same sensitivity _ , nearly all the lyman  only systems of samples  8 and  9 would have heavy element detections .    granting that this could be the case however",
    ", we would still be faced with the question of why the lwhed and these lyman  only systems seem to have different evolutionary rates , and whether the bias introduced by the incomplete coverage is responsible for this difference .",
    "the following argument suggests that biases in spectral coverage are not likely the explanation for the effect we observe . in the range of rest wavelengths accessible with the gratings used in our sample ,",
    "the c  iv doublet is the most ubiquitous ion found , as is well known from groundbased studies .",
    "the other most prominent lines ( or doublets ) are , in order of decreasing rest wavelength : the si  iv doublet ( @xmath471393,1402 ) , c  ii  @xmath481334 , si  ii  @xmath481260 , the n  v doublet ( @xmath471238,1242 ) , si  iii  @xmath481206 , the o  vi doublet ( @xmath471032,1037 ) and c  iii  @xmath48977 .    if all of these ions were roughly equally likely to occur , then the lack of spectral coverage would have little effect on the values of @xmath3 in samples  8 and  9 .",
    "the si  ii  @xmath481260 line , for example , representative of low ionization systems , is nearly always accessible when  is itself .",
    "the same is true for si  iii  @xmath481206 , typical of intermediate ionization systems .",
    "the lack of coverage which would lead to the inability to detect the high ionization c  iv doublet for  redshifts above about 1.1 would be roughly compensated for by the ability to detect o  vi for  redshifts above about 0.65 , for objects in which g190h data exist , and above about 1.2 for those objects in which only g270h data exist .    however , to the extent that c  iv is the most frequently occurring and readily detectable heavy element ion , extending the spectral coverage to wavelengths beyond @xmath483270 ( corresponding to c  iv redshifts above 1.1 ) would preferentially remove systems at high redshifts ( @xmath49 ) in the putative lyman  only systems and transfer them to the lwhed systems .",
    "this would tend to steepen the lwhed evolutionary rate and flatten the lyman  only rate . to make a semi  quantitative estimate of the magnitude of this latter effect ,",
    "we define one additional sample of lyman  only lines ( sample  10 , table  2 ) which has precisely the same sensitivity limits and path length coverage as the lwhed sample  7 . from these two samples",
    "we calculate the fraction of  lines in which the c  iv ion is seen in those cases in which it was accessible ( about 12% ) . for every  line in sample  10",
    "for which the redshift is such that c  iv was _ not _ accessible we used a random number generator and this fraction of 12% to produce a set of `` virtual line lists '' in which we imagined that the c  iv line was sometimes detected in instances where it was not accessible in the real line lists .",
    "the average values of @xmath3 resulting from this procedure for what we might call `` virtual samples  7 and  10 '' ( but not shown in table  2 ) are 1.95 and 0.16 respectively , ( with uncertainties in @xmath3 about the same as the real values ) compared to the actual values of 1.55 and 0.25 .",
    "the effect is in the anticipated direction increasing the spectral coverage would preferentially discover high redshift c  iv lines , and move high redshift systems from the lyman - only category into the lwhed category , thus increasing the difference in the two gammas .",
    "we find that the difference in the @xmath3 s between these two virtual samples is significant at about the 2.8@xmath14 level .",
    "one additional possibility which might give rise to the different rates of evolution found for samples  6 _ vs. _  8 or 7  _ vs. _  9 would arise if the high ionization systems which cluster around the emission redshifts , most of which appear to be intrinsic to the qso , have a significant high  velocity tail which extends well beyond 3000  km  s@xmath18 . removing such systems would preferentially remove the highest redshift systems along each individual line of sight and thus lower the @xmath3 of the lwhed systems .",
    "analysis of the actual distribution in `` ejection velocity '' space shows that this is not likely to be an important effect : in the 5000  km  s@xmath18 bin between @xmath502000 and 3000 km  s@xmath18 ( the `` in - falling '' systems probably represent the difference between the true systemic velocity and that inferred from the broad emission lines ) there are 19 lwhed systems . in the next two 5000  km  s@xmath18 bins ( from 3000 to 8000 and 8000 to 13,000 km",
    "s@xmath18 ) there are 4 and 5 such systems respectively , and the numbers remain at about this background level for the higher velocity bins .",
    "evidently , there is no very significant high velocity tail which could likely give rise to the possibility just described .",
    "while the foregoing is hardly a rigorous analysis , it seems unlikely that effects primarily attributable to incomplete spectral coverage , line misidentification , or a high velocity tail of intrinsic systems can account for the lwhed rate of evolution being steeper than those exhibited by the lyman  only systems .",
    "thus , if one is willing to accept these results as statistically significant , what is the most likely explanation for this ?",
    "it is of course possible that the lwhed and high - rew lyman  only systems really represent differences in metal content . only by improved sensitivity , higher resolution , larger samples and extended spectral coverage can this be confirmed . a program which can and",
    "should be readily carried out is to obtain the appropriate groundbased data in order to extend the data base for the c  iv doublets which actually do accompany the  lines in our samples  8 , 9 and  10 above redshifts of 1.1 .",
    "we believe a more likely explanation for the difference in the evolutionary rates between the lwhed and lyman  only systems than metallicity differences , is simply that there is a significant difference in h  i column densities between the lwhed systems and the lyman  only systems of samples  8 and  9 , despite our attempt to match the two samples in terms of the distribution of equivalent widths . as examination of the curves - of - growth in figure  5 makes clear , for the entire range of equivalent widths represented by nearly all the lines in samples  610 ,",
    "the equivalent widths give virtually no reliable information at all about the h  i column density .",
    "this insensitivity is worsened by blends which cause blended lower column density systems to masquerade as very high column density single systems .",
    "the lwhed systems probably simply act as markers to pick out those systems with h  i column densities large enough for the heavy element ions to be detected at our fos sensitivities .",
    "we would then conclude that over the 2 - 3 orders of magnitude range in h  i column densities represented by samples 610 there is a systematic increase in the rate of evolution with increasing h  i column densities .",
    "support for this view comes from the rate of evolution of the lyman limit systems which occur fairly frequently among the stronger lwhed systems having several different ion species ( cat3 ) .",
    "the lyman limit systems were found by @xcite to have values of @xmath3 in the range 1.01.5 , depending upon the particular sample analyzed .      despite the insensitivity of the rew to h  i column density for all but our weakest lines , we can attempt to examine whether there is any evidence within our sample for a dependence of the rate of evolution upon rest equivalent width . in view of our conclusion above concerning the reason for the difference in evolution rate between the lyman  only and lwhed systems",
    ", we ignore the distinction between the lyman  only and lwhed systems and divide up the 920  lines in sample  2 into five rew bins , whose boundaries are chosen so that for the five samples each bin contains the same number ( 184 ) of lines .",
    "this leads to rew bin boundaries ( in  ) of 0.06 , 0.22 , 0.32 , 0.45 , 0.64 and @xmath51 .",
    "( there are no lines detected with rew less than 0.06    in our sample . ) except for the highest two rew bins , the spread in rest equivalent width is not large enough to allow the parameter @xmath21 to be well  determined for the individual bins .",
    "we have therefore fixed the value of @xmath21 to the value found in sample  2 ( 0.273 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath3 depend only weakly on the actual value of @xmath21 selected , as long as this value does not fall much below about 0.20 . for the higher equivalent width bins , the samples are virtually identical for the u and v samples , but for the lower rew bins both the sample size and redshift range drop strongly for the u samples ( the u sample has no meaning for the lowest rew bin ,",
    "since there is virtually no coverage over which the minimum detectable rew is everywhere @xmath52 0.06   . )",
    "we thus consider only v samples .",
    "we estimate the errors in @xmath3 due to the formal uncertainty in the fit , together with the sensitivity to the assumed fixed value of @xmath21 , to amount to about @xmath530.50 .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath3 _ vs. _ rest equivalent width are shown in figure  7 .",
    "figure  7 is suggestive of an increase in the rate of evolution with increasing equivalent width , in accordance with expectations if our preferred explanation for the difference in the lwhed and lyman  only systems is correct , though the trend exhibited by the first 4 bins is not continued for the highest rew bin .",
    "this result is qualitatively in accord with the analysis of @xcite as well as the analysis of @xcite at high redshifts based upon high resolution data .",
    "using the homogeneous sample of hst  fos spectra obtained during the qso absorption line key project , and the set of lines measured and identified using objective and reproducible procedures , we have analyzed a subset of 63 of these spectra to investigate the evolution of the  lines in the sample . the subset of these objects and associated line lists are those objects excluding the strong broad absorption line qsos , qsos whose spectral coverage did not cover the region blueward of , qsos whose line identifications are not yet complete , and those qsos or portions of qso spectra that were only observed using the low dispersion g160l grating , having a resolution of @xmath17 1100 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "our main result is that over the redshift range from 0 to 1.5 , the rate of evolution , as parameterized by @xmath3 in the expression @xmath6 , is very much flatter than found from groundbased data which involve redshifts higher than about 1.7 and for which estimates in the literature have varied over a wide range of values .",
    "in particular , the analysis by @xcite yielded a value of @xmath3 of 1.85 ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "the fits to the groundbased data and our data intersect at a redshift of about 1.51.6 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 we find (  0.16 for sample  2 ) are in general smaller than what is expected for clouds whose product of ( comoving ) number density and cross  section is constant , as might be expected for ,  stable clouds in galaxy disks or halos . for the currently popular value of @xmath54 , under this assumption",
    "the value of @xmath3 varies only slightly , from 0.9 at zero redshift to about 0.85 at a redshift of 1.5 .",
    "our data thus implies that the overall ensemble of  absorbers evolve so that this product becomes smaller with increasing redshift .",
    "the fit to a power law in @xmath30 for the larger samples is quite good , as is the fit for the distribution of rest equivalent widths by an exponential .",
    "we find two exceptions to the flat rate of evolution described above :    \\1 ) when we examine the  lines from the single high redshift qso , um  18 , for which complete line identifications have been made , the line density in the redshift bin between @xmath55 and @xmath56 apparently shows a strong upturn in the rate of evolution ( though the identifications are still somewhat uncertain and there are only 19 lines in this bin ) .",
    "\\2 ) samples consisting of  lines which have ions of the heavy elements identified at the same redshift as the  lines , or which are within 300 km  s@xmath18 of the redshift of systems containing such ions ( the lwhed samples  6 and  7 ) show a much faster rate of evolution than the large total samples (  sample 2 ) or the lyman  only samples (  samples 4 and 8) even when a subset of the lyman  only systems crudely matching the rest equivalent width distribution of the lwhed set are considered .",
    "discussion of selection effects suggests that line misidentification and incomplete spectral coverage is probably not responsible for this difference .",
    "in fact , simulations suggest that the difference between the lwhed samples and the lyman  only samples increases when account is taken of the incomplete spectral coverage of our data .",
    "we find evidence that the rate of evolution increases with increasing rew .",
    "as noted in the introduction , there have been significant advances in the detail with which simulations of the properties of the absorption lines can now be carried out .",
    "it is the case , though , that high resolution simulations incorporating small ( galaxy - sized ) scales , high column densities , and shocks , and requiring the incorporation of both hydrodynamic and many  particle gravitational processes , have largely been confined to redshifts above about 2.0 , well above the redshift regime of our data , and are just now being extended to redshifts of 0.0 .",
    "there is a general consensus , though , that if one avoids the smallest scales , and higher column densities , then the baryons trace rather well the collisionless particles in the cold dark matter scenarios .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter rpm ) took advantage of this to carry out simulations using a many  body code to obtain results to @xmath57 , allowing for shock heating in an approximate way .",
    "we therefore limit comparison of our results to this paper , in which comprehensive references to other recent simulations may be found .    by also modeling the evolution of the uv background radiation , which obviously plays a major role in determining the hi column density , their simulations yield the evolution of line density with redshift ( for lines with @xmath58 )",
    "see their figure  5which is quite similar to our figure  6 .",
    "( for a doppler parameter of 30 km  s@xmath18 , this column density implies a rest equivalent width of about 0.25    see our figure  5 ) . since the thermal history of the gas plays an important role in the simulations , which is in turn affected by whether the gas has been shocked or not , rpm distinguish two populations of absorbers ( `` @xmath59 '' and `` @xmath60 '' ) , in which material in the first population has not been shocked , and material in the second population has been .",
    "( in reality , there is no doubt a continuum of properties rather than a sharp dichotomy between two such populations . )",
    "the rpm simulations indicate that the unshocked material is found primarily in under - dense regions , and in the more outlying regions of condensations , while the shocked population is found in the vicinity of regions undergoing condensations to clusters and individual galaxies .",
    "rpm further suggest that it is among the shocked population that metal enrichment will be found .",
    "their simulations show that the unshocked population evolves the more rapidly with increasing redshift and thus dominates the absorbers at high redshifts , while it is the shocked population that has the flat evolution and dominates at low redshifts ( see their figure  6 ) . finally , they suggest that the very weakest lines evolve much more slowly than the stronger lines ( their figure  7 )",
    ". their models are thus in qualitative agreement with our results , but the column densities they associate with their shocked population and which they predict to dominate at low redshifts are smaller than we can detect with our fos data . while their association of the metal ",
    "enriched lines with the slowly evolving shocked population might seem in apparent contradiction with our result that those  systems with detectable heavy elements evolve more rapidly than those without , the minimum degree of metal enrichment which these authors envisage is well below our threshold for detection .",
    "regardless of whether the division of absorbers into `` shocked '' and `` unshocked '' populations is realistic , both the apparent rapid evolution of the  lines above a redshift of @xmath0 1.5 , and the difference in rates of evolution of the lyman  only and lwhed systems suggest that rather different physical processes and/or environments are involved , and these different processes and environments would be expected to also affect the question of the association of absorbers with galaxies .",
    "the dependence of the rate of evolution upon the  line strength suggested by our figure  7 raises interesting questions about the nature of the relationship between the  absorbers and galaxies , and in particular about the nature of this relationship for the weaker lines .",
    "the relation between galaxies and low redshift  absorbers has been investigated by a large number of investigators over a number of years .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that moderate sized galaxy halos could account for metal - containing absorption systems while larger halos could account for the larger number of lines .",
    "subsequent to the launch of hst , the relation between galaxies and low redshift  lines has been examined quantitatively by a number of groups . in a recent extensive analyses",
    ", @xcite examined the cross ",
    "correlation statistics between  absorbers and galaxies _ for _  _ absorbers with equivalent widths greater than 0.3 _   .",
    "they find that the cross section for producing absorbers at a given equivalent width increases with the b - band luminosity of the galaxy ( but is not strongly dependent upon morphological type ) and that for a given luminosity there is a strong anti  correlation between equivalent width and impact parameter .",
    "they also find that _ the absorption properties show little or no correlation with redshift_. they conclude that a significant fraction  at least 50% of all such absorbers are physically associated with outer gaseous envelopes of galaxies extending to @xmath0160 kpc .",
    "they further suggest that very low luminosity galaxies  whose properties and spatial density are not yet well  determined  could account for the remaining fraction .",
    "our fits for the value of @xmath3 of our large samples (  sample 2 ) are significantly less than expected for objects whose product of comoving number density times cross section is constant , and which , as noted above , for the currently popular value of @xmath61 , implies a value of @xmath3 of about 0.9 .",
    "the assumption of a constant product of comoving number density times cross section is , in fact , implicit in the evaluation by @xcite of the expected line density  see their equation ( 29)and is supported by the absence of any significant correlation of galaxy  absorber properties with redshift in their analysis .    our conclusion in  7.2 that the rate of evolution depends upon line strength , and in  5 that the product of number density times effective cross section decreases with increasing redshift for the sample as a whole , leads to at least one of the following three conclusions :    \\(1 ) the association between  absorbers and galaxies _ at the lower end of our equivalent width distribution _ is not as tight as implied by the @xcite relation .",
    "inspection of contours of constant h  i column density which have been published for higher redshifts suggests this is likely to be the case , and for the weakest low redshift  lines the notion of well - defined `` galaxy halos '' is probably not very meaningful .",
    "\\(2 ) over the redshift and equivalent width ranges of our sample , there is a more complex and redshift - dependent relation between line strength , galaxy luminosity and impact parameter than that found by @xcite over the more limited range of line strength and redshift covered in their analysis .",
    "\\(3 ) the types of galaxies associated with a significant number of the  lines evolve in a very different way from `` ordinary '' galaxies . in particular",
    ", the rate of evolution we deduce for the weaker lines in our sample is different from the population of blue dwarfs , ( which @xcite suggest may account for a significant fraction of the  lines ) , whose rate of evolution is _ more _ rapid than that of typical luminous galaxies .",
    "conclusion 1 ) would be consistent with the failure to find a strong galaxy  absorber association among the very low column density absorbers (  @xcite ) .",
    "only more detailed studies of the statistics of galaxy-  association extending to weaker  lines , higher redshifts , and fainter galaxies can definitively settle these issues .",
    "we suggest that the lwhed systems involve moderate h  i column density clouds , higher than those associated with the weaker lyman  only systems , but generally not as high as the low  ionization and lyman limit systems , which comprise a relatively small fraction of the lwhed sample .",
    "these latter systems may arise in clouds pressure - confined in thermalized halos , as initially suggested by @xcite ; investigated observationally by , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ; and discussed in detail theoretically by @xcite .",
    "these absorbers may have column densities which are too high and scales which are too small and too closely associated with galaxies to be well  reproduced in the rpm simulations .",
    "the foregoing , together with the results of  7.2 , imply that at low redshifts , high h  i column density clouds evolve more rapidly than those of low h  i column density , just as they do at higher redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , regardless of what combination of the three scenarios enumerated above proves most nearly correct , it still leaves unanswered the question of _ why _ the line density evolves as it does as a function of redshift and line strength .",
    "the variation of the ionizing background radiation with redshift obviously plays an important role , but can not be the sole factor , since such variations would cause the h  i column densities to scale in the same way .",
    "however , local evolving ionizing sources could bring about differing rates of evolution by affecting more strongly the nearer and higher h  i column density clouds .",
    "our conclusions and speculations need to be , and can be , investigated more carefully using high resolution and high sensitivity data . in particular , at the redshifts dealt with in this paper , a data set taken with , e.g. stis , at a resolution of @xmath62 km  s@xmath18 would avoid almost entirely ambiguities associated with line blending . a rigorous assessment of the effects of line blending at the fos resolution would require detailed simulations of spectra which cover the full range of line strengths and density of lines encountered in our data set , and which utilize the relatively small amount of existing high resolution hst data .",
    "such simulations would then need to be analyzed using exactly the same procedures we have used for the actual data .",
    "a few such simulations and analyses have been carried out ( paper  ii ) , but not at sufficiently high line densities . lacking this ,",
    "we give only the following qualitative and semi - quantitative comments :    at low redshifts (  below 0.5 ) the observed line densities in our spectra are so low that blending of lines from the mean background is not a significant problem , nor is the effect of line crowding in affecting the placing of the continuum .",
    "for example , in the spectrum of pks  0405@xmath5012 , the mean separation between the 4.5@xmath14 lines in our sample is about 15 times the spectral resolution , so blending by random superposition of lines rarely occurs",
    ". it could nevertheless be the case that even isolated features break up into multiple components if there is substantial velocity structure on scales less than our resolution .",
    "resolving such structure would of course affect the derived equivalent width distribution , but unless the amplitude of such structure varied with redshift it would not affect the discussions of the rate of evolution . in any case , the rather sparse amount of high resolution data on the very low redshift  lines suggests that this is not likely to be an important effect .    at the upper end of our redshift range ( @xmath01.5 ) , the ratio of the mean line separation to the spectral resolution has decreased to about five , for the reasons discussed in  4 .",
    "thus , quite aside from clustering , we should expect that of order 20% of our 4.5@xmath14 lines would be affected by blending . depending upon the detailed structure of such blends , the deblending algorithm may or may not break up such blends into the correct number of components , and the assignment of the individual equivalent widths to the components is dependent upon the detailed structure of the blend .",
    "the effect of blending upon the rate of evolution of the  lines is subtle and complex .",
    "naively , one would expect that blending would decrease the number of lines compared to the number measured with higher resolution but the same limiting equivalent width .",
    "however , resolving the blends in such a situation also has the opposite effect , since the decreased equivalent width of resolved blends would cause many of the lines now in our sample to move below the 4.5@xmath14 level .",
    "in addition to the affects of line blending _ per se _ crowded spectra make the placement of the continuum increasingly subjective .",
    "because of these uncertainties , in our comparison of the hst results with ground - based results , we have chosen to place more emphasis on the @xcite and @xcite results , rather than higher resolution ground - based data (  @xcite ) since the former two studies were carried out with spectral resolution and line densities more nearly comparable to ours .",
    "finally , the foregoing discussion warrants strongly re - emphasizing the remarks made in  3.1 : in our view , the value of our analysis and data set will be most fully realized via comparison between the simulated spectra of detailed hydrodynamic numerical simulations just now reaching zero redshift .",
    "such simulated spectra can be modeled to have exactly the resolution and sensitivity characteristics of our data , and _ by analyzing them in precisely the same way that our fos data set has been analyzed , most of the problems above will be circumvented . _",
    "in addition to largely avoiding problems caused by line crowding , if the nature of the  absorbers really can be described roughly in terms of two components  or perhaps three as suggested above  but more realistically in terms of a continuum of environmental conditions , then a high resolution , high sensitivity data set would allow exploration of other properties in addition to metallicity and rate of evolution which would likely reflect these differing conditions",
    ". these would include the correlation of the  absorbers with galaxies or , more generally , the amount of local over or under  density , and the clustering among the lines themselves , as well as their doppler and equivalent width distributions . in cat2 we have already presented evidence indicating that some  lines tend to cluster around strong heavy element  containing systems .",
    "the redshift regime around 1.41.8 appears to be an extremely interesting transition region insofar as the  absorbers are concerned , and efforts to study correlations in these various properties in this redshift regime should be carried out . with the new generation of large groundbased telescopes , and careful attention to the design of the spectrograph and detectors ,",
    "lines down to redshifts as low as @xmath0 1.55 can probably be studied more effectively than from stis , but for redshifts below that we will have to rely on stis or the cosmic origins spectrograph .",

    "we use maximum  likelihood estimation to obtain values of the parameters characterizing the evolution of the  lines .",
    "a detailed description of this formalism as applied to the evolution of the forest was given by @xcite .",

    "equivalent width ( rew ) . in  5",
    "we discuss whether these simple assumptions are an adequate description of the distribution function .",
    "the extension of the formalism described here to more complex expressions for @xmath67 and @xmath68 is straightforward but for the present data set they seem adequate .    in order to explicitly obtain error estimates for the normalization constant , a",
    ", we modify the @xcite formulation of the maximum likelihood estimation so that the normalization factor a ,  the line density at some fixed redshift , ( generally chosen to be zero ) and integrated over some range of rews , appears explicitly as a parameter to be determined along with ,  @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "we imagine redshift  rew space to be divided up into a large number of cells , small enough that we may always neglect the probability of two or more lines being found in any one cell . if @xmath69 is the expected number of lines to be found in a cell at redshift @xmath36 and rew @xmath66 , then the probability of the cell having no lines in it is @xmath70 while the probability of a cell being `` full '' (  having one line in it ) is @xmath71 .",
    "we can replace the first sum in equation a-5 as an integral over all the accessible regions of redshift and rew space . retaining only the terms which involve the unknown parameters , one obtains for the function to be minimized      where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the usable redshift limits for the @xmath81 qso ( see table  1 ) , the first sum is over all the qsos in the sample , and the second sum is over all the lines in the sample .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 is defined as          the quantity @xmath91 is the `` blocking factor '' defined in cat1 .",
    "note that the normalization factor @xmath92 appears explicitly as an unknown factor with an associated uncertainty , in contrast to the formalism in murdoch   the normalization constant @xmath92 , along with @xmath3 , and @xmath21 are found by finding their values for which @xmath93 is minimized . in the case of the normalization constant , this can be done explicitly and setting @xmath94 , and solving for @xmath92 leads to      where @xmath96 , the effective path length , is defined by equation a-9 .",
    "equation a-9 is an obvious result , but this formulation leads to formal estimates in the uncertainty in a and the coupling between its uncertainty and the uncertainty in the other parameters , as described below .",
    "note that the effective path length , @xmath96 , takes into account the variation in signal  to - noise as a function of wavelength for each individual spectrum , and couples the equations determining @xmath3 and @xmath21 in a complex way .",
    "this expression for the path length also depends explicitly , of course , on the assumption of the distribution of rest equivalent widths being adequately described by an exponential , leading to variable rew detection limit ( `` v '' ) samples . to avoid this assumption",
    "we can restrict the spectral regions which contribute to the path length and to the lines in the sample to those regions having a detection limit which is everywhere more sensitive than some specified value , and consider only lines above this value ( uniform detection limit , or `` u '' samples ) . as described in the text , the results for the two cases are generally quite similar for large samples .          in this section",
    "we describe the method we have used for estimating the uncertainties in the fitting parameters , but also describe two other slightly different approaches , and compare the three methods to get some indication of the reliability of the error estimates .",
    "in general , if @xmath97 is the ( normalized ) probability distribution for the 3 fitting parameters and ( for example ) @xmath98 is the marginal distribution of @xmath3 , if we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of the other parameters , then lower and upper confidence limits ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath3 ) are given by the expressions @xmath101 and @xmath102 .        for a large number of lines in the sample , and for a large range in redshift",
    "we expect the `` entropy '' to have a sharp minimum around the most probable values and to rise steeply around this minimum , so that expanding the entropy function around the most probable value and keeping only 2nd order terms should be a good approximation . in this case",
    "the probability function is gaussian with the surfaces of constant probability being ellipsoids .",
    "the 1@xmath14 confidence limits , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , then yield the same estimates as the expression for the dispersion in equation a12 .    in general , the principal axes of the error ellipsoid",
    "do not coincide with the a , @xmath3 and @xmath21 axes (  there are non  zero mixed 2nd derivatives in the expansion of the entropy function ) and the integral in a12 is most conveniently evaluated by transforming to the principle axes and then carrying out the appropriate integrals .",
    "this method of estimating the errors in the maximum likelihood function and using the gaussian approximation is the one used for the uncertainties quoted in table  2 and we refer to this method as `` method 1 '' .    for relatively small samples ,",
    "the gaussian approximation becomes poorer , and the surfaces of constant probabilities typically take on a `` banana shape '' (  @xcite ) . as in storrie - lombardi , estimates for the uncertainty in the values of the fitting parameters have sometimes been made by locating the entropy contour for which @xmath106 and taking  @xmath107 , to be the extremes of @xmath3 defined by this contour .",
    "we denote this method by `` method 2 '' .",
    "when the gaussian approximation is not used , the marginal distribution function is not symmetric about the most probable value and the average of the marginal distribution function is not the most probable value . an alternative to method 2 is to use equations a-11a and a-11b to evaluate the confidence limits .",
    "this method is somewhat preferable to method 2 since it uses the distribution of s over the entire parameter space . rather than evaluating the integrals a-11a and",
    "a-11b numerically over the probability function based upon a single realization  the fixed ( observed ) number of lines along each line of sight , and the fixed observed distribution of those lines in redshift - equivalent width space  we regard the values determined from the maximum likelihood estimation as representing some true underlying distribution .",
    "we then use monte carlo methods to : ( i ) sample the number of lines along any sightline from a poisson distribution whose expectation value is that appropriate for the sensitivity and spectral coverage of that sightline ( ii ) select the equivalent width and redshift for the lines along this sightline from the underlying @xmath3 and @xmath21 distributions ( iii ) for each realization , use the maximum likelihood code to give values of @xmath92 , @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "the ensemble of realizations then populates empirically the density of points in @xmath92 , @xmath3 , @xmath21 space .",
    "one may then simply sort the resultant values of ,  @xmath3 from all the trials , and by inspection determine the values corresponding to the two confidence limits .",
    "this procedure probably comes closest to giving a true estimate of the uncertainties in the parameter estimates and also has the advantage that it serves as a check on the code .",
    "we refer to this procedure as `` method 3 '' .    in practice , for the full data set discussed in this paper , and for the determination of all three parameters ,",
    "method 3 requires a prohibitive amount of computation , and even method 2 is rather cumbersome . in order to compare these three methods therefore ,",
    "we have considered a very simple case involving a single line of sight , with a uniform detection limit , so that only the a and @xmath3 variables are coupled .",
    "specifically , imagine a line of sight spanning the redshift range @xmath57 to @xmath55 with an underlying value of @xmath3 = 1.0 , and consider three cases for which the expected number of lines is 10 , 100 and 1000 . for methods 1 and 2",
    "we take the sum of @xmath108 ( see equations a2 , a6 and a7 ) over the lines in the sample to be the mean expected for @xmath3 = 1.0 .",
    "the results for these three methods for estimating the uncertainty in @xmath3 are summarized in table  a-1 . for method 1 , the values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 are equal and the uncertainty goes exactly as @xmath111 , but for methods 2 and 3 the upper and lower confidence limits are slightly different and the scaling of the confidence limits as @xmath111 is only approximate .",
    "inspection of table  a-1 shows , however , that for the sample sizes dealt with in this paper , the method we have used should give results which are accurate to within a few percent .      if the minimum detectable equivalent width at every redshift were uniform , and if there were an equal number of sightlines at every redshift , then the raw distribution functions would represent a fair sample of the true distributions of lines as a function of equivalent width and redshift . in general , neither of these conditions",
    "is satisfied . as mentioned in the text",
    ", we can calculate cumulative distribution functions in terms of `` effective redshift path lengths '' ( as in @xcite ) and `` effective equivalent width path lengths '' , in which case every detected line increments the empirical distribution function by an equal amount . in practice , however , these path lengths are highly non  linear functions of redshift and equivalent width .",
    "we have therefore elected to weight each line to compensate for the incompleteness in the redshift and equivalent width coverage .          in equation",
    "a-14 the sum is over all the qsos whose spectra include the wavelength corresponding to a  line of redshift @xmath36 , and @xmath119 is the @xmath120 detection rew at that wavelength for the @xmath121 qso .",
    "( the normalization to 1.0 is performed after the initial sum is calculated . )",
    "these formulations give a reasonable representation of the `` true '' distribution functions , but give large weights to lines found in sparsely sampled portions of redshift or equivalent width space ( figure  2 ) .",
    "this can be seen , for example in the jump in the cumulative redshift distribution function ( figure  3 ) in the region around redshifts from about 0.31 to 0.36 , where the coverage from the g130h grating stops and the region from 1600  to 1650    in the g190h grating has very low sensitivity .",
