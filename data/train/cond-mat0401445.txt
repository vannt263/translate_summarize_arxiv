    "in financial theory and practice , interest rates are a very important subject which can be approached from several different perspectives .",
    "the classical theoretical approach models the term structure of interest rates using stochastic processes .",
    "various models have been proposed and can be found in @xcite . although they provide analytical formulas for the pricing of interest rate derivatives , the implied deformations of the term structure have a brownian motion component and are often rejected by empirical data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the inadequacies of the gaussian model for the description of financial time series has been reported since a long time ago by mandelbrot @xcite , but thanks to the availability of large sets of financial data , the interest on this point has risen recently @xcite . in particular , the fat - tail property of the empirical distribution of price changes has been widely documented and is a crucial feature for monitoring the extreme risks and for accurately pricing interest rate derivatives . an important recent development in the pricing of interest rate derivatives is the emergence of models that incorporate lognormal volatilities for forward libor or forward swap rates while keeping interest rates stable @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "up to now , no universally accepted theory has been obtained for the description of interest rates data @xcite .    in this framework , we have empirically studied the probability density distribution of libor , in order to characterize the stochastic behavior of the daily fluctuations . in section [ sec2 ] , we present the data set and the data analysis .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains a short discussion of a possible ir derivative pricing scheme using martingale methods .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the daily increment of the interest rate series is non - gaussian , non - brownian and follows a leptokurtic distribution .",
    "the problem arises of how derivatives written on interest rates can be evaluated , given that the usual gaussian white - noise assumption of many models is not satisfied .",
    "indeed , a first partial answer , is that the central limit theorem ensures that , after a sufficiently long time , the increment distribution will tend to a gaussian distribution .",
    "however , if the time horizon of derivative evaluation is not appropriate , deviations from the gaussian behavior may lead to a dramatic underestimate of large increments with a consequent improper risk coverage as well as option price estimate . although well studied in mainstream finance ,",
    "this problem has received much attention in recent times , within the community of physicists working on financial problems . in particular , bouchaud and",
    "sornette @xcite suggested the direct use of the historical probability measure , rather than the equivalent martingale measure for evaluating options . in this way , one gets an option price depending on the expected rate of returns , a consequence which is not fully desirable due to the subjective character of that rate .",
    "assessing trends is a difficult task , as they depend on decision taken by central banks ( as shown in fig.[f.2 ] ) and are based on macroeconomic effects .",
    "thus , martingale methods could prove more reliable . as early as 1977 ,",
    "some years after the seminal paper of black and scholes , parkinson generalized their approach to option pricing and explicitly took into account leptokurtic distributions @xcite .",
    "more recently , boyarchenko and levendorskii have studied the problem of option pricing in the presence of a specific distribution which seems to fit well the empirical data in many instances : the truncated lvy distribution @xcite .",
    "wim schoutens has recently published a book on lvy processes in finance devoted to the extension of martingale methods to a large class of leptokurtic distributions @xcite .",
    "the method can be described from a heuristic point of view .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the stochastic process underlying a contingent claim @xmath1 ; thus , @xmath0 can be a price process , an interest rate process , etc .. let @xmath2 be the corresponding logarithmic process .",
    "let further @xmath3 be the probability density of finding the value @xmath4 of the random variable @xmath5 at time @xmath6 ( this is a conditional probability density in @xmath4 with respect to suitable initial conditions ; here , @xmath7 ) .",
    "this density defines the probability measure @xmath8 .",
    "it is possible to show that , if the following relation holds true : @xmath9 \\ } = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\exp(ax ) \\ ; p(x , t ) \\ ; dx = \\exp[g(a ) t]\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the expectation operator with respect to @xmath8 , @xmath11 is a complex number and @xmath12 a complex function of @xmath11 , then the process @xmath13 $ ] is a martingale with respect to the measure @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of girsanov s theorem , we can build an equivalent martingale measure @xmath14 such that the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath15 is given by : @xmath16 in order to price a contingent claim written on @xmath17 $ ] , we require that the discounted process @xmath18 is a martingale with respect to the measure @xmath14 .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the process @xmath19 is a martingale with respect to @xmath8 . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that interest rates are fluctuating variables .",
    "however , just for the sake of simplicity , let us consider a fixed interest rate @xmath20 . in this particular case , the martingale condition is equivalent to the following equation : @xmath21 in other words , if it is possible to determine a single value of @xmath11 such that eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) is satisfied , the measure @xmath14 exists and is unique . for instance , if @xmath0 is described by geometric brownian motion with drift @xmath22 and volatility @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 and there is a unique solution of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) : @xmath25 .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the case of truncated lvy processes .",
    "then , under the requirement that @xmath1 be a martingale with respect to the measure @xmath14 , one can find the price of the contingent claim .",
    "if @xmath26 is the discounted process , we have : @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the appropriate filtration .",
    "the technique has been already applied to derivatives written on interest rates , here , we outline the generalization of a popular ir model : the heath , jarrow and morton ( hjm ) model , following eberlein and reible @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the zero - coupon bond price @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30 \\frac{\\exp[\\int_0^t \\sigma(t , s)\\;dw_s]}{e\\{\\exp[\\int_0^t \\sigma(t , s)\\;dw_s]\\}},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the bond volatility structure , @xmath32 is the wiener process , @xmath33 is the expectation operator and @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath35 has been interpreted as the instantaneous forward rate @xmath36 .",
    "the wiener process can be replaced by a leptokurtic lvy process @xmath37 , such that the expectation in the denominator is finite . in this case , it is possible to show that the discounted bond - price process is a martingale and that the martingale measure is unique @xcite .",
    "also , the european vanilla call option price on a bond maturing at time @xmath38 can be obtained @xcite . along these lines",
    ", we believe , it is possible to develop a consistent option pricing theory taking into account the leptokurtic character of the empirical short to mid - term interest rate distributions .",
