    "the discovery eight years ago of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in graphene sparked an immediate interest in the metrological community .",
    "the qhe is a fascinating macroscopic quantum effect occurring in two - dimensional conductors and relates the resistance quantum , @xmath0 only to the fundamental constants of nature , @xmath1 , the planck constant and , @xmath2 , the elementary charge @xcite .",
    "although metrology has successfully used the qhe for more than two decades to realise the resistance scale @xcite , graphene is a material with properties like no other .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal crystal lattice structure , is a truly two - dimensional metal with a linear dispersion relationship characteristic for massless dirac - type charge carriers @xcite .",
    "the unique bandstructure of this semi - metal has both practical and fundamental implications .",
    "firstly , the massless nature of the charge carriers leads to a landau level spectrum with an energy gap between the first two levels which is around five times larger than that in semiconductor materials for magnetic fields around 10 tesla .",
    "this implies that the qhe in graphene can be observed at much reduced magnetic fields and/or much higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "secondly , the marked difference in bandstructure and charge carrier characteristics between graphene and semiconductor systems allows for a demonstration of the universality of the quantum hall effect through a rigorous test of the material independence of the value of @xmath3 , the von klitzing constant .",
    "theory predicts no major corrections to the simple relation @xmath3 . the quantum hall resistance is considered to be a topological invariant  @xcite , not altered by the electron - electron interaction , spin - orbit coupling , or hyperfine interaction with the nuclei .",
    "it has also been shown that the quantized hall resistance is insensitive to much more subtle influences of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "recently , a quantum electrodymical approach to charge carriers in a magnetic field has predicted a tiny correction to the von klitzing constant of the order of @xmath4 for practical magnetic field values  @xcite .",
    "however , the size of this predicted correction is about 8 to 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the most accurate measurement techniques available and therefore untestable .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental nature of the hall resistance quantization makes experimental tests of its universality of the utmost importance .",
    "universality of @xmath0 will also strongly support the pending redefinition of the si - units for kilogram and ampere in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the hall resistance in two different substances does not prove the exactness of the relationship @xmath3 , however , material independence is a significant factor in establishing the fundamental nature of @xmath5 .",
    "this material independence turns out to be rather difficult to establish .",
    "indeed the characteristics of qhe samples must satisfy very stringent requirements  @xcite and in 30 years only silicon mosfets ( metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ) and iii - v semiconductors ( gaas / algaas or ingaas / inp heterostuctures ) did so  @xcite .",
    "the first accurate measurements of the qhe in graphene were performed by giesbers _",
    "_  @xcite on exfoliated samples .",
    "the precision obtained in these measurements was at the part - per - million ( ppm ) level and limited by the high contact resistances together with a low maximum source - drain current which these samples could sustain before breakdown of the qhe occured .",
    "a large measurement current determines the maximum signal - to - noise ratio and increasing this breakdown current is key to high - accuracy measurements .",
    "one established method of increasing the breakdown current is to increase the sample width  @xcite which is not easy to achieve with the exfoliation technique .",
    "a breakthrough came in 2009 , when several groups within days of each other succeeded in growing large - area wafers of epitaxial graphene by sublimation of sic ( sic / g ) with a quality good enough to observe quantized hall resistance  @xcite . in an indirect comparison with a gaas / algaas heterostructure device via an intermediate room - temperature standard resistor , tzalenchuk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first to demonstrate an accuracy of 3 parts in @xmath6 ( ppb ) for the resistance quantization in a large sic / g device ( see fig .  [ labelfig1 ] ) .",
    "the measurement system  @xcite was of identical design to that used by giesbers _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the key factor in the large improvement was the very low contact resistances which could be achieved and an order of magnitude increase in the breakdown current .",
    "the large breakdown current in sic / g is not simply the result of a larger device but finds its origin in a charge exchange mechanism between the sic substrate and graphene , leading to an unusually strong pinning of the quantum hall state  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism turns out to be stronger for lower carrier densities and by using a novel photochemical gating technique , lara - avila _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have been able to develop a graphene device with an extremely robust @xmath7 quantum hall state .",
    "robustness in this context means invariance of the quantization under changes of magnetic field , temperature or source - drain current and is a key requirement for any practical application .",
    "recently , the same team undertook a direct comparison between sic / g and gaas , using an enhanced measurement system , demonstrating equivalence of @xmath8 with a relative uncertainty of 8.7 parts in @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "when a conducting material is placed simultaneously in electric ( @xmath10 ) and magnetic ( @xmath11 ) fields , charge carriers ( @xmath2 ) ( electrons or holes ) moving with a velocity @xmath12 experience a magnetic ( lorentz ) force proportional to @xmath13 . in the hall bar geometry of fig .",
    "[ labelfig2]a , carriers moving in the @xmath14-direction ( @xmath15 ) will be deflected by the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath16 and accumulated at the edges of the sample .",
    "this accumulation of carriers gives rise to a potential build up in the direction transversal to carrier propagation ( @xmath17 ) , the hall voltage . under these conditions the resistivity , with @xmath18 the ( infinitesimal ) thickness of the sample .",
    "@xmath19 has the same dimensions as the 3d resistance ( @xmath20 ) . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "the units of @xmath19 are most of the time explicitly written as @xmath21/square .",
    "sometimes , however , the words _ resistance _ and _ resistivity _ for two - dimensional samples are used indistinctly .",
    "] of the sample takes a tensor form , being different in the direction parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the current .",
    "we define the _ transversal _",
    "resistivity @xmath22 as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the sheet carrier density .",
    "the constant of proportionality between the transversal resistivity and the applied magnetic field is called the _ hall _ coefficient ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the _ longitudinal _",
    "resistivity of the sample @xmath26 , on the other hand , is independent of magnetic field and can be obtained by measuring the voltage developed along the direction of the current and taking into account the geometry of the sample ( length @xmath27 and width @xmath28 ) .",
    "@xmath29    in general , low - field hall effect measurements are a simple yet powerful tool to study electronic properties of materials . the magnitude and sign of the hall coefficient have been extensively used to characterize electronic materials in terms of carrier type ( electrons or holes ) and density @xmath24 ( per unit area ) .",
    "in addition , the hall coefficient and the longitudinal resistivity can be combined to find the average carrier mobility in the sample as @xmath30 .",
    "the _ classic _ hall effect picture breaks down when working with high mobility , two - dimensional systems at low temperatures and in strong magnetic fields @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "quantum effects are manifest as quantized steps in @xmath22 , while simultaneously the longitudinal resistance vanishes , @xmath31 ( fig . [ labelfig2]b ) .",
    "steps and plateaux in the transversal resistance occur at universal values of @xmath32 , with @xmath1 the planck constant , @xmath2 the elementary charge and @xmath33 and integer .",
    "this is the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "the qhe can be understood as a consequence of landau quantization @xcite . under the presence of a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the size of the cyclotron orbit shrinks and becomes comparable to the wavelength of carriers .",
    "if the mobility in the system is high enough so that a carrier can complete a few cyclotron orbits before its momentum is relaxed , that is :    @xmath34    then the size of the orbit can only take some allowed values , corresponding to an integer number times the electron wavelength ( @xmath35 is the relaxation time ) .",
    "recalling that the cyclotron frequency is given by @xmath36 and the carrier mobility can be expressed as @xmath37 , condition ( [ labeleq3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the effective mass ) .",
    "thus , quantum effects can in principle be observed with @xmath40  t if the mobility of the sample is around @xmath41 @xmath42v@xmath43s@xmath43 .",
    "quantized cyclotron motion modifies dramatically the density of states by breaking it into discrete levels , so - called landau levels ( ll ) , which are the allowed energies for cyclotron orbits under quantizing conditions ( fig .",
    "[ labelfig3]a ) .",
    "formally , ll are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for free electrons in a 2d systems , in the presence of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the problem reduces to that of a harmonic oscillator shifted by the magnetic length @xmath44 , with eigenvalues given by @xcite : @xmath45 with the reduced planck constant @xmath46 , the cyclotron frequency @xmath36 , and @xmath47 an integer , zero included . in theory , each ll is a heavily degenerate delta function in the density of states filled with localized states undergoing cyclotron motion . in real samples ,",
    "nevertheless , ll are broadened by the presence of disorder , ( fig .",
    "[ labelfig3]a ) due inelastic collisions ( energy exchange ) of localized electrons with impurities .",
    "the steps observed in @xmath22 in the qhe can be explained by considering that ll are filled with localized carriers undergoing cyclotron motion .",
    "as carriers undergo cyclotron motion , they enclose a quantum of magnetic flux @xmath48 , and thus the number of localized carriers per unit area , @xmath49 , in the system can be found as : @xmath50    with @xmath49 known , the number of completely filled landau levels @xmath33 ( so - called filling factor ) can be found by dividing the total density of electrons in the system , @xmath24 , by the number of localized carriers , @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath51    when a ll is full the fermi level lies in a gap between occupied levels and the filling factor @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ ch1:filling_factor ] must be an integer ( fig .",
    "[ labelfig3]a ) .",
    "if we substitute the discrete density of states resulting from the formation of ll into the field - dependence of @xmath22 for the classic hall effect ( eq . [ labeleq1 ] ) , we find that @xmath22 is quantized as :    @xmath52    a common interpretation for the qhe is in the picture of extended states , carrying current without dissipation ( zero resistance ) along the edges of the sample , and localized states undergoing cyclotron motion in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the origin of zero longitudinal resistance @xmath26 is that extended states propagating in one direction of the sample are spatially separated from those carrying current in the opposite direction , thereby suppressing backscattering .",
    "maxima in @xmath26 are observed every time the fermi level crosses the center of a ll ; plateaux in @xmath22 and vanishing @xmath26",
    "are observed whenever the fermi level lies in between the center of ll , pinned by localized states .",
    "experimentally , quantum hall plateaux can be observed by : a ) fixing the magnetic field and varying the fermi level of the sample with e.g. an electrostatic gate or b ) fixing the fermi level ( fixed carrier concentration ) and varying the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ labelfig3]b ) .",
    "in resistance metrology the value of the quantized hall resistance , either at @xmath53 refers to the quantum hall resistance , defined as @xmath54 , as opposed to the hall coefficient @xmath55 mentioned earlier ] for @xmath7 or at @xmath56 for @xmath57 , needs to be compared with standard resistors at decade values typically in the range of 1  @xmath58 to 100  @xmath59 .",
    "room temperature measurement systems such as potentiometric or current transformer bridges can perform these measurements to a level of a few parts in @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "however , most top - level national measurement laboratories make precision measurements with a so - called cryogenic current comparator ( ccc ) bridge  @xcite .",
    "a ccc bridge can be used to determine the ratio of almost any pair of resistors with an accuracy of a few parts per billion ( ppb )  @xcite .",
    "if one of these resistors is a quantum hall device , it can be used to realise the value of the other resistor in terms of the si ohm via the internationally agreed value of the von klitzing constant , @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "if both resistors are quantum hall devices , the ccc bridge can be employed to determine the universality of the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of a ccc can be understood by considering a simple superconducting tube with two current - carrying wires running through .",
    "magnetic flux generated by the wires is excluded from the superconductor by the meissner effect through a screening current on the surface of the superconductor . the flux generated by the screening current on the outside of the tube is sensed by a pick - up coil connected to a squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) . when the currents in the two wires are equal and opposite the screening current is exactly zero and , importantly , independent of the position of the wires inside the tube which allows for the very high accuracy of this device .",
    "the bridge circuit for measuring the ratio of two resistors in terms of the current ratio determined by a ccc is schematically shown fig .",
    "[ labelfig4 ] .",
    "two isolated current sources `` master '' and `` slave '' separately drive current through resistors @xmath62 and @xmath63 and associated windings @xmath64 and @xmath65 on the ccc .",
    "the current ratio can be set via electronics to a few parts in @xmath66 and this ratio is improved to a level of 1 part in @xmath9 by forming a negative feedback loop from the squid sensing the net flux in the ccc to the slave current source . when balanced , the reading on the nanovoltmeter is exactly proportional to the resistance ratio ( often a second servo loop is used to null the nanovoltmeter reading by injecting a current in a third , @xmath67 , small winding on the ccc  @xcite ) .",
    "the main uncertainty components of the bridge are , the noise of the squid sensor , the johnson noise of the resistors being measured and the current and voltage noise of the null detector .",
    "these components combine to give a typical measurement uncertainty of 1 ppb for a measurement time between 5 and 15 minutes  @xcite .    in principle",
    "the value of the quantized hall resistance is exactly @xmath68 when the magnetic field is set to integer filling factor @xmath33 .",
    "however , in practice there are many possible effects which can cause the hall resistance to deviate from exact quantization .",
    "one of the key factors is unwanted dissipation : if @xmath26 is not exactly zero , the hall device is not in the non - dissipative state and @xmath22 will deviate from exact quantization . also if the contact resistances to the 2deg are too large ( typically @xmath69 ) , excessive dissipation will occur at the contacts which again can cause errors in @xmath8 . over the last two decades",
    "the metrological community has evaluated all possible errors in the quantum hall effect and composed a set of experimental guidelines which , when precisely followed , will result in a measurement uncertainty smaller than 1  ppb @xcite .",
    "when measuring two quantum hall devices with a combined impedance of @xmath70 the current - noise properties of the nanovoltmeter start to dominate the uncertainty budget .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by employing a second ccc in place of the nanovoltmeter ( see fig .  [ labelfig5 ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are replaced by qhr samples @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) .",
    "the potential contacts on @xmath71 and @xmath72 are closed in a loop via winding c on this second ccc ( see fig .",
    "[ labelfig5 ] ) .",
    "this device is configured with just a single winding to measure a current null rather than two windings to establish a current ratio .",

    "the allan deviation is very convenient for a resistance ratio measurement involving periodic current reversals as it leads directly to the expected measurement resolution for a given measurement time ( @xmath35 ) . from the figure",

    "the derived si unit for ohm is @xmath78 and depends on four of the seven base units . in practice ,",
    "the route to realise the ohm does not involve the ampere realization but rather relies on a powerful electrostatics theorem by thompson and lampard @xcite .",
    "the theorem states that the change in cross - capacitance of a specific four - electrode device as a function of change in guard electrode only depends on frequency and length which both can be realized with very small uncertainty . from impedance we can get to resistance via a long and complex chain of a.c . bridges which to date has been done to a few parts in @xmath60 @xcite .",

    "the permeability of vacuum @xmath81 and the speed of light @xmath82 are fixed quantities with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , the first report on the quantum hall effect was presented as a new and more accurate determination of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this determination of @xmath79 can be compared with other determinations such as high precision measurements and calculations of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , gyromagnetic ratio of protons or the mass of neutrons which result in a combined value of the fine structure constant with an uncertainty of 3.2 parts in @xmath75  @xcite .    early on after the discovery of the quantum hall effect it was realized that the stability and reproducibility of the qhe was much better than the ability to realize its value in si units .",
    "therefore in 1990 it was decided to assign a constant value to @xmath5 called @xmath61 with value @xmath85 exactly without uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this has allowed metrology laboratories to calibrate standard resistors with uncertainty typically in the range of 5 ppb or better @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 means that the quantum hall effect should be universal , by which we mean that the value of @xmath5 is independent of the sample properties ( carrier density , mobility , dimensions , landau level index and host material of the 2deg ) .",
    "however , there is no quantitative theoretical model which proves this and the problem has essentially been addressed experimentally .",
    "the method described in the previous section is limited in accuracy by the complexities of an si realization  @xcite and a much higher precision can be achieved by directly comparing two quantum hall devices against each other in a dimensionless null measurement .",

    "@xcite improved on this result and reduced the uncertainty to @xmath87 .",
    "subsequently , the universality has been tested by varying the mobility , channel width and plateau index number  @xcite . from the results",
    "one can conclude that in semiconductor systems the universality between different semiconductors has been established within a few parts in @xmath75 .",
    "even better performance for the universality test could be achieved by using four quantum hall devices in a wheatstone bridge configuration developed by schopfer and poirier  @xcite .",

    "a direct comparison of four gaas devices has demonstrated an accuracy of 4 parts in @xmath9 and an uncertainty of a few part in @xmath88 is conceivable  @xcite .",

    "combination of the accurately known ( though relatively small ) wide - band optical absoption in graphene and high sensitivity and speed of graphene bolometers , can lead to novel quantum - based , fast , fairly compact and simple radiometers , linking the optical scale to the fine structure constant .      although the most precise mass sensing experiments with a resolution of 1.7 yoctogram ( @xmath339 ) , which corresponds to the mass of one proton , have been performed using carbon nanotube nems @xcite , replacing them with graphene @xcite brings the advantage of a larger area for force application and better coupling to the displacement sensor , although compromising the resonant frequency and hence the quality factor .",
    "the fundamental problem of the resonance - based mass ( or force ) measurements is that one can not tell the mass ( force ) distribution on the resonator from the frequency shifts ( one can not hear the shape of the drum @xcite ) even when multi - mode measurements are carried out . in the case of mass",
    "sensing , this problem can potentially be solved by functionalizing graphene or nanotube , so that the rest mass ( e.g. , a gas molecule ) is absorbed at an atomically defined position . for force sensing graphene nems can be driven by the local radiation pressure and read - out also optically .",
    "having in mind the quantized optical absorption of graphene this may give a unique way of realizing sensitive force measurements linked to fundamental constants .",
    "in addition , graphene strain gauges with either electrical or optical readouts look very promising .",
    "graphene is the only crystal which can be stretched by @xmath340 @xcite , thus enhancing the working range of such sensors significantly .",
    "detection of individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene s surface have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron , which leads to step - like changes in resistance .",
    "the achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low - noise material electronically .",
    "this opens up unprecedented applications requiring counting of species , such as the measurements of the amount of substance on the nanoscale . for analytical applications",
    "however these measurements should be made discriminatively between different atomic / molecular entities , which requires chemical functionalization of the graphene sensor .",
    "we can confidently predict that other , even more exciting applications of graphene in metrology will be investigated .",
    "it can be argued @xcite that the major advantage of graphene sensors is their multi - functionality .",
    "a single device can be used in multidimensional measurements ( for example , strain , gas environment , pressure and magnetic field ) . whether or not graphene will fulfill the expectations is yet to be seen .",
    "but if we can practically realize the potential of this unique two - dimensional material , than the impact on technology and metrology will no doubt be revolutionary .",
    "the journey from original discovery of the qhe in graphene to a quantum resistance standard which outperforms the established technology in many aspects has been remarkably short . for epitaxial",
    "graphene the robustness of the quantization in terms of temperature , magnetic field and source - drain current is exceptional .",
    "the material is cheap and relatively easy to fabricate and process .",
    "it allows for the realization of a quantum resistance standard with modest means , e.g. a small superconducting magnet and cryocooler . as such it will improve the proliferation of quantum standards and allow many smaller laboratories to realize their own resistance scale .",
    "one even could envisage university students being able to perform qhe experiments , much in the same way as the discovery of high-@xmath341 superconductors enabled table - top experiments with josephson junctions in many science classes .",
