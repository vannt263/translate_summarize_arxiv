    "general relativity ( gr ) continues to be , even after almost one hundred years , our best theory of gravity . using gr we are able to derive simple cosmological models , such as the friedman or lemaitre models , that describe quite well the evolution of the universe in which we live in . up to now",
    "gr has passed every experimental test that we were able to come up with . in the last decades in order to explain the astrophysical observations related to rotation curves of spiral galaxies we where more or less forced to introduce the concept of dark matter .",
    "it did not pass long time and once again we where forced to introduce the so called dark energy in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe suggested by astrophysical observation of supernovae redshift .    over time",
    "there have been various attempts to modify gr having as motivation different reasons , like the desire to quantize gr in order to be able to unify it with the other three elementary known forces : electromagnetic , weak and strong nuclear forces .",
    "one of the most simple modifications that can be made to gr is to add higher order invariants to the standard einstein - hilbert action , leading to the so called higher - order theories of gravity .",
    "a class of this theories is the theory known under the name of @xmath1 gravity which is obtained from gr by adding higher powers of the ricci scalar to the standard gr action . among the motivations for the study of @xmath1 theories is the fact that by adding suitable extra terms to the action we can recover the evolution of the universe as observed today without the need of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "this paper is intended to present some basic notions about @xmath1 theories of gravity and some simple cosmological models that can be derived from it .",
    "we start by making an extended review of the least action principle for gr and @xmath1 theories of gravity .",
    "there are several formulations of @xmath1 theories known under the name of metric formalism , palatini formalism and metric - affine formalism , the last one being the most general . in this paper",
    "we will work only in the first two formalisms .",
    "a special attention is given to the surface boundary term ( the analogue of gibbons - york - hawking boundary term from gr ) which is treated in section 5 .",
    "after that we show how @xmath1 theories can be made equivalent to gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field with the help of conformal transformations .",
    "the last sections of the paper are reserved for the study of cosmological models .",
    "we begin with the famous classical gr friedman and lemaitre models and then continue with cosmological models inspired from @xmath1 theories .",
    "let us end with the remark that this paper is addressed first of all to master and phd students and for this reason we give as much detailed calculations as possible and we also tried to write it in a pedagogical way .",
    "it can also be of use to physicists that are specialized in other fields than theoretical physics and gr in particular .",
    "one of the most powerful tool that theoretical physics posses is represented by the principle of least action . using this form of a variational principle we can derive in an elegant way the equations characteristic for a specific phenomena . in what follows we will use this technique to obtain the einstein equations of gravity , and later the equations for more general theories such as @xmath2 theories of gravity .",
    "we know that the most simple non - trivial scalar that can be constructed using only the metric tensor and it s derivatives is the ricci curvature scalar @xmath3 .",
    "then the most simple action for general relativity in vacuo turns out to be the einstein - hilbert action @xmath4 if we take into account also the presence of matter fields , then the general action can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the einstein - hilbert and the matter lagrangians are given by @xmath7 in ( [ 3 ] ) we denoted by @xmath8 the matter fields and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the newton s gravitational constant ( and the speed of light is set to one by choosing the natural system of units @xmath11 ) .",
    "now we will give a detailed review for the derivation of einstain equations following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in order to obtain gr equations from action ( [ 2 ] )",
    "one needs to calculate the variation of the action with respect to the metric tensor .",
    "we consider a variation for the metric tensor of the form @xmath12 for now we will assume that both the variation of the metric ant it s first derivatives are vanishing on the boundary @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is a hipervolume in the space - time manifold ) @xmath15 let us now write the first - order variation of the einstein - hilbert action ( [ 2 ] ) as @xcite @xmath16 where we use the fact that the ricci scalar can be written as @xmath17 in order to calculate the variation of the determinant @xmath18 of the metric we will need the following formula from linear algebra @xmath19 from which follows immediately @xmath20 and taking into account that by definition the adjoint of a matrix is @xmath21 , one gets in the end @xmath22 because we are choosing to make the variation of the action with respect to @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 ( although in the end the same equations are obtained in both cases ) we will derive now a relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in order to do that we will start from the following relation @xmath25 and using the fact that the constant tensor @xmath26 dose not change under a variation , one may therefore write @xmath27 or after multiplying with @xmath28 and rearranging it , one gets @xmath29 we now relabel the indices @xmath30 and multiply again by @xmath31 to get @xmath32 inserting the above expression in ( [ 10 ] ) we can now calculate the variation for @xmath33 @xcite as @xmath34 in order to extract the field equations from ( [ 6 ] ) we need to factor out the variation @xmath23 . to do this",
    "we first need to express @xmath35 in terms of the variation of the metric and it s derivatives . because the ricci tensor is obtained from the full riemann curvature tensor by @xmath36 in what follows we will derive the variation of the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "this can be done in a number of ways , but the most straightforward one is to calculate first the variation of the curvature tensor .",
    "the riemann tensor is given by @xcite @xmath37 in terms of the connections @xmath38 .",
    "for gr the standard connection is the levi - civita one @xmath39 under an arbitrary variation of the connection coefficients @xmath40 we can write from ( [ 17 ] ) that @xmath41 do to the fact that we can choose to work in local geodesic coordinates at some arbitrary point @xmath42 at which the christofel symbols can be made zero ( @xmath43 ) @xcite and in that point also holds that the ordinary derivative is identical with the covariant derivative defined by @xmath44 we can write the variation of the riemann tensor at the point @xmath42 as @xmath45 the fact that @xmath46 is a tensor and the rhs of ( [ 21 ] ) contains only tensorial quantities tells us that this relation holds in any coordinate system ( see @xcite or @xcite for more details ) . the result ( [ 21 ] ) thus holds generally and it is known as the palatini equation . using ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) we can now write the variation for the ricci tensor @xmath47 it now follows that @xmath48 introducing this together with relation ( [ 15 ] ) into ( [ 6 ] ) we have the following expression for the variation of the action ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath49 the last integral of relation ( [ 24 ] ) can be transformed into a surface integral via the gauss - stokes theorem and because on the surface we impose the conditions ( [ 5 ] ) then the surface integral will vanish .",
    "however , this will no longer be the case for the @xmath2 action when the surface term can not be made zero in general ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more details ) . taking this into account the final expression for the variation of @xmath50",
    "can be written as @xmath51 after calculating the variational integral @xmath52 and setting it to zero we obtain in the end the einstein equations of gravity for empty space @xmath53 for the remaining of this section we will analyse the full action ( [ 2 ] ) , which can also be written as @xcite @xmath54 where we denoted with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the lagrange densities given by @xmath57 varying action ( [ 27 ] ) with respect to ( inverse ) metric we obtain @xmath58 we already saw that the first term of the above relation gives us the einstein tensor @xmath59 defined by ( [ 25 ] ) or ( [ 26 ] ) as @xmath60 comparing ( [ 29 ] ) with the full einstein equations @xmath61 we can now give a definition for the stress - energy momentum tensor as a function of the metric and the matter lagrangian @xmath62 it can be shown ( see for example @xcite ) that the stress - energy momentum tensor ( [ 32 ] ) has all the proprieties required of an energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in the previous section we ve argued that the last integral in relation ( [ 24 ] ) will vanish if we transform this integral via the gauss - stokes theorem and we impose the supplementary condition @xmath63 .",
    "let us now see what happens when we drop out this condition . then on the boundary the variation of the metric derivatives will no longer vanish , case in which we will have a non - vanishing boundary term .",
    "if this is the case , then from the variation of the action ( [ 1 ] ) given by ( [ 24 ] ) we will no longer obtain the einstein gr equations . in order to fix this problem",
    ", one needs to amend the action ( [ 1 ] ) with a new term , called the gibbons - york - hawking boundary term @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ( which can be seen as a contraterm ) @xmath64 the variation of this new boundary term is ( conform ( [ 24 ] ) ) @xmath65 and if we define @xmath66 then the boundary term can be written as @xmath67 in order to express this variation in terms of @xmath23 we first need to compute the variation of the connection coefficients .",
    "let us rewrite here the levi - civita connection ( [ 18 ] ) @xmath68 from this follows immediately @xmath69 taking into account the boundary condition @xmath70 the variation ( [ 36 ] ) gives @xmath71 using this result for computing @xmath72 in ( [ 34a ] ) , we have @xmath73 we can transform ( [ 34b ] ) by applying the gauss - stokes theorem @xcite,@xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the determinant of the induced metric , @xmath76 is the unit normal 4-vector to @xmath77 and @xmath78 if @xmath79 is a timelike hipersurface or a spacelike one .",
    "now we can write @xmath80 as @xmath81 let us now compute the quantity @xmath82 . using ( [ 38 ] ) we get @xmath83 the connection between the metric @xmath84 and the induced metric is given by the following relation @xcite @xmath85 then @xmath86 where in the second line we used the fact that @xmath87 is multiplied by the antisymmetric quantity within the brackets .    now , because the tangential derivatives of @xmath88 are vanishing on the boundary @xmath89 eq .",

    "let us now show that this formula is equivalent with the expression given by relation ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "because the induced metric @xmath94 is fixed on @xmath79 the variation of @xmath95 will be @xmath96 in order to calculate the variation of the extrinsic curvature , we start by recalling it s definition @xcite @xmath97 using the above , the variation of @xmath93 will be @xmath98 introducing this result into ( [ 47 ] ) we obtain @xmath99 which shows that by adding @xmath95 to the original @xmath100 action we recover the einstein field equations .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) is a comprehensive theory of space - time , gravity and matter .",
    "based on gr nowadays we have a model of the universe called the standard cosmology model .",
    "more recently , new evidence coming from astrophysics and cosmology are showing that the universe is currently going through a faze of accelerated expansion @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is thought that this expansion is determined by the existence of an unknown form of energy called dark energy which has not been detected directly and dose not cluster as ordinary matter dose .",
    "the latest data provided by the plank mission of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) give us the following composition for the total mass - energy content of the universe : 4.9% ordinary baryonic matter , 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy @xcite .",
    "the term dark matter refers to an unknown form of matter , which has the clustering properties of ordinary matter but has not yet been observed or detected in the laboratory .",
    "it is assumed that the universe had also an early time accelerated epoch as predicted by the inflationary paradigm @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the inflationary epoch is needed to address the so - called horizon , flatness and monopole problems @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite as well as to provide the mechanism that generates primordial inhomogeneities acting as seeds for the formation of large scale structures @xcite,@xcite .    the simplest model which adequately fits the new observations described above is the concordance model or @xmath101 ( @xmath102-cold dark matter ) supplemented by some inflationary scenario , usually based on some scalar field called inflaton .",
    "however , this model dose not explain the origin of inflation or the nature of dark matter and like other models is burdened with the well known cosmological constant problem @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a different approach for solving the problems raised by the new cosmological observations is to consider the alternative of modifying general relativity . in this category",
    "enter the so called higher - order theories of gravity , i.e. , modifications of the einstein - hilbert action in order to include higher - order curvature invariants with respect to the ricci scalar ( see @xcite for a historical review and a list of references to early work ) .",
    "one can deviate from gr in various ways , the most well known alternative is the scalar - tensor brans - dike theory @xcite .",
    "other typical examples are dgp gravity ( dvali - gabadadze - porrati ) @xcite , braneworld gravity @xcite , teves ( tensor - vector - scalar ) @xcite and einstein - aether theory @xcite .    in what follows we will describe one class of modified theories of gravity known as f(r ) theories of gravity ( for reviews on f(r )",
    "one can consult @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these theories are obtained by modifying the einstein - hilbert action @xmath103 in the following way @xmath104 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath3 .",
    "the appealing feature of this action is that it combines mathematical simplicity with a fair amount of generality .",
    "for instance if we take a series expansion of @xmath105 @xmath106 where the @xmath107 and @xmath108 coefficients have the appropriate dimensions , we see that the action includes a number of phenomenologically interesting terms .",
    "@xmath2 actions where first rigourously studied by buchdahl @xcite .",
    "higher order action can include also other curvature invariants , such as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 etc .",
    "an interesting example is the brans - dicke action @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a scalar field and @xmath114 is called the brans - dicke parameter .",
    "it can be shown that f(r ) gravity is equivalent with the brans - dicke theory for @xmath115 in the metric formalism and @xmath116 in the palatini formulation of f(r ) theory ( see reference @xcite ) .    in order to obtain the einstein equations we apply a variation principle on action ( [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "this can be done in two ways depending on which variational principle one uses @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the standard approach is the variation of action @xmath117 with respect to the metric tensor @xmath118 ( known also as the metric formalism ) , while the less standard variation , called palatini variation , is when one varies the action with respect to the connection and the metric if we are assuming that the two are independent variables . in the case of palatini formalism",
    "we are also making the assumption that the matter action dose not depend on the connection .",
    "we will show in this section that the two formalisms give us in general different field equations with the observation that for a linear action in @xmath3 we obtain in both cases the usual einstein equation ( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "thus we see that we have two versions of @xmath1 gravity : f(r ) gravity obtained in the metric formalism and palatini @xmath1 gravity if we choose to work with the palatini variation . if we give up to the assumption that the matter action is independent of the connection we end up with a third version of @xmath2 gravity , known under the name of _ metric - affine @xmath2 gravity _",
    "@xcite,@xcite , which is the most general of these theories .",
    "the action in the metric formalism is made of two terms @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the matter action and we denoted by @xmath121 the matter fields .",
    "thus we can write the total action for @xmath2 gravity as @xmath122 varying action ( [ 3.6 ] ) with respect to the metric , after some manipulations ( see section [ 1.4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 is the standard covariant derivative ( obtained via levi - civita connection ) , and @xmath126 is the laplace operator in four dimensions .    from ( [ 3.7 ] ) we can immediately read the new einstein equations @xmath127 f'(r)=\\kappa t_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] one immediately sees that eqs .",
    "( [ 3.8 ] ) are fourth order partial differential equations in the metric @xmath31 . in the particular case when @xmath128 is a constant we see that the forth order terms ( the last two on the lhs of [ 3.8 ] ) will vanish .",
    "if @xmath128 is a constant then obviously @xmath2 is a linear function of @xmath3 and the theory reduces to standard general relativity ( gr ) .    the trace of eqs ( [ 3.8 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath129 this is a differentially relation between @xmath130 and @xmath131 , opposed to the algebraic one of gr , where @xmath132 .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) tells us that @xmath1 theories can have more solutions than einstein s classical theory .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) with @xmath133 dose not necessarily imply that @xmath134 , or that @xmath130 is constant . from",
    "gr we know that a constant ricci scalar leads us to maximally symmetric solutions . in the case of @xmath1 , for @xmath135 and @xmath136 ,",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) reduces to @xmath137 the form of the function @xmath138 will tell us the type of the maximally symmetric solutions , as follows : if @xmath138 is chosen such that @xmath134 is a root of eq .",

    ". the action will have the same form as in the case of metric variation .",
    "however , the riemann tensor ( denoted by @xmath146 ) and the ricci tensor ( @xmath147 ) will not depend directly on the metric because we use for their construction the independent connection .",
    "thus the action takes the following form @xmath148 from ( [ 3.14 ] ) we can see that the matter action dose not depend on the independent connection , this being an important property of the palatini @xmath1 gravity and will also play an important role in obtaining einstein gravity in the case of an linear function for @xmath1 .",
    "we return now to derive the field equations for palatini @xmath2 gravity . due to the fact that @xmath146 dose not depend on the metric",
    ", the variation of action ( [ 3.14 ] ) with respect to @xmath118 is straightforward .",
    "however , the variation with respect to the connection is a little more tricky because we need first to calculate the variation of @xmath149 ( see section 5 for a derivation ) @xmath150 where we denoted by @xmath151 the covariant derivative defined with the independent connection .",
    "we note that the variation of the matter action with respect to the independent connection is zero , since the mater action dose not depend on @xmath152 and by definition @xmath153 is defined with the help of relation ( [ 32 ] ) .    using eq .",

    "( [ cf20 ] ) we obtain @xmath456 which can be solved immediately to give @xmath457 thus , we find the interesting result that the constant - curvature vacuum solutions are not minkowski space , but rather are de sitter space and anti de sitter space @xcite .    the time - time component of the field equation ( [ cf18 ] ) for the flat ( @xmath275 ) frw metric ( [ cf1 ] ) is @xmath458    the other independent equation is the space - space component of eq .",
    "( [ cf18 ] ) @xmath459 by setting @xmath460 we recover the usual friedman equations @xmath461 the new friedman equations ( [ cf23 ] ) and ( [ cf24 ] ) are of forth order and very difficult to solve .",
    "because of this it is more convenient to transform the equations to the einstain frame . in our case",
    "the conformal factor ( [ c8 ] ) will be @xmath462 next , we would like to find a relation between the conformal transformed hubble parameter @xmath463 and the old one @xmath464 . in order to to that let us write first the following transformation relations @xmath465 then we can write for the hubble parameter the followings @xmath466 where a prime denotes differentiations with respect to conformal time and we also used the following formula @xmath467 the scalar field potential defined in ( [ c15 ] ) now reads @xmath468    note that the scalar field potential is zero both when the scalar field itself is zero or when this goes to infinity .",

    "\\(a ) eternal de sitter : is obtained when the scalar field @xmath242 comes to a rest after reaching the maximum of the potential @xmath248 given in ( [ cf31 ] ) .",
    "this state is obtained for a critical value of the initial condition , namely @xmath486 when the universe evolves asymptotically to a de sitter solution which turns out to be very unstable because any perturbation of the field will make it roll away from the maximum of it s potential .",
    "\\(b ) power - law acceleration : is achieved for @xmath487 , when the field overshoots the maximum of @xmath248 and the potential can be further approximated by @xmath488 . in this case",
    "it is easily to solve for @xmath489 , which corresponds to @xmath490 .",
    "thus , the universe evolves to late - time power - law inflation .",
    "\\(c ) future singularity : is obtained when @xmath491 , case in which the scalar field rolls back down to @xmath492 .",
    "the most representative model of @xmath493 cosmology is the so called starobinsky @xcite model with the help of which inflation can be explained without a need for a scalar field .",
    "this model is obtained for @xmath494 where @xmath495 is constant and has dimension of inverse mass squared .",
    "now equations ( [ 3.8 ] ) can be written as @xmath496 using eq .",
    "( [ cf19 ] ) it can be seen immediately that the constant - curvature vacuum solution is the usual minkowski space - time .",
    "after we introduce the frw anzat in ( [ c2r2 ] ) , the combination of friedman equations can be written as @xmath497 @xmath498 for the inflationary epoch the first two terms of ( [ c2r3 ] ) can be neglected relative to others , obtaining @xmath499 from which follows immediately the solution @xmath500 and @xmath501 where @xmath502 and @xmath503 are initial values at the beginning of inflation .    like in the previous section",
    "we may take a conformal transformation of the form ( [ c8 ] ) and go to the einstein frame in order to discuss the inflationary dynamics of the theory .",
    "we will choose , for the moment , to ignore all the matter fluids , since they do nt play any significant role during the inflationary phase .",

    "using the fact that during inflation the ricci scalar can be approximated by @xmath509 ( where we used ( [ c2r5 ] ) ) , then during inflation holds that @xmath510 . now , the transformation ( [ cf27 ] ) gives a relation between the time @xmath511 in the einstein frame and the old time @xmath306 @xmath512 using eq .",

    "the evolution of the hubble parameter is given by @xmath516 we observe that the hubble parameter is decreasing with time . from ( [ c2r12 ] ) and ( [ c2r13 ] ) we can conclude that the universe expands quasi - exponentially in the einstein frame .",
