    "understanding the fundamental properties of planetary nebulae ( pne ) requires knowledge of their distances . for planetary nebulae , because of the absence of a standard quantity common to all , there is no well - calibrated standard distance scale and distances estimated from different independent methods often disagree with each other .",
    "one way to determine the distance of a planetary nebula is to measure its angular expansion during a period of time and combine this with its doppler expansion velocity .",
    "this method has been used for both vla ( very large array ) radio maps @xcite , and optical images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) @xcite .",
    "( hereinafter , `` bd+30 '' ) is a rapidly evolving , chemically inhomogeneous nebula @xcite .",
    "it is one of the few nebulae with detected x - ray flux from its bubble of shocked stellar wind @xcite .",
    "this justifies extensive observations of this object . to understand the rapid chemical evolution of bd+30",
    ", we need to know the mass and luminosity of its central star , and this requires a reasonably accurate distance .",
    "the earliest expansion distance of bd+30 was obtained by @xcite from vla maps , who gave a result of @xmath7 kpc .",
    "@xcite used different two - epoch vla observations , resulting in a distance of . @xcite",
    "combined the observations used by @xcite with a new set of data obtained in 1993 , and derived the most accurate measurement at that time of @xmath8 kpc .    to obtain a more accurate determination of the distance , and details of its expansion",
    ", we used the two - epoch optical observations of _ wide field planetary camera _ ( _ wfpc2 _ ) on board the _ hst _ to measure the expansion of this nebula .",
    "the total expansion of bd+30 was estimated to be about 15 mas between the first and second epochs , which is about 1/3 of the _ planetary camera _ ( _ pc _ ) 00455 pixel .",
    "this tiny displacement in diffuse objects can be measured because of the high resolution of _",
    "images @xcite , and we can do even better for a number of diffuse knots sharing a common proper motion .",
    "much evidence shows that bd+30 is not actually a spherical object @xcite .",
    "we thus use an ellipsoidal kinematic model of bd+30 to combine the angular expansion with the radial expansion velocities from spectroscopic observations to find the distance and kinematic age of this nebula .",
    "_ hst _ narrow - band images from our go programs 5403 and 8116 were used for this study ( table [ observtable ] ) ; the observations were separated by 5.663 years . for both epochs , images through f656n ( h@xmath0 ) and f658n ( [ ] ) narrow - band filters were obtained . in the first epoch",
    "there were two images for each band with the same pointing but different exposure times .",
    "the images with longer exposure time were saturated in places . for the second epoch",
    ", there were three images for each band , with the same exposure time and orientation , but slightly shifted by fractional pixels with respect to each other for the purpose of drizzling . since the orientation differs for the two epochs , the images had to be aligned to a common center and orientation",
    "the data reduction includes cosmic ray rejection , drizzling , and image alignment .",
    "other adjustments or corrections like geometric distortion correction , saturated pixel masking , were also done during the three main steps .    because the 2nd epoch h@xmath0 and [ ] images were dithered cosmic rays can not be removed by the commonly used iraf task _",
    "crrej_. however , @xcite and @xcite introduced a method to remove cosmic rays from a group of dithered _ hst _ images , as well as an iraf package _ drizzle _ for this purpose .",
    "we first used iraf task _ cross_driz _ , _ shiftfind _ , and _ imshift _ to find the relative displacement between images , and align the images .",
    "then , we used _",
    "crrej _ to combine the aligned images to produce cosmic - ray - free images . finally , _",
    "driz_cr _ was used to create cosmic ray masks , which were used in the drizzling step .    using the iraf package _ drizzle _ , three 2nd epoch h@xmath0 images and three 2nd epoch [ ] images with _",
    "pc _ image resolution 800@xmath9800 were combined into images with resolution 1600@xmath91600 , respectively . to compare images from the two epochs ,",
    "the old ( the 1st epoch ) images were also mapped into the same 1600@xmath91600 grid by the _ drizzle _ package , and cosmic rays were removed by the same strategy as for new ( the 2nd epoch ) images .",
    "it is easy to tell that some features are sharper in the new drizzled images than in the old images ( which were merely mapped onto finer grids ) .",
    "the drizzled h@xmath0 image is shown in fig .",
    "[ drizzled_halpha ] .    to perform the comparison between new images and the old ones , images had to be aligned in displacement and position angle .",
    "the relative rotational angle and shift between two epochs of images were found by iraf task _",
    "cross_driz _ , _ rotfind _ , and _ shiftfind _ , iteratively .",
    "the most ideal and simplest situation is that the expansion is isotropic , so that it looks symmetrical .",
    "we took this as the 0th order approximation , and did the alignment by trail - and - error strategy with the following measurements to make the measured average expansion along radial lines as symmetrical as possible .",
    "by blinking the aligned images taken at two different epochs back and forth , the expansion can be seen clearly by eye .",
    "the expansion in 1600@xmath91600 images is estimated about 0.5 to 1 pixel ( or 0.25 to 0.5 pc pixels ) .",
    "the actual measurements were performed using several different independent methods .",
    "basically , there are two ways to measure the expansion ; one is magnification , which is whole - image - based , the other is to measure the shifts of individual features . if the expansion is spherically symmetric , the new image should be a magnified version of the old image .",
    "this method can be applied to the whole image , or along sectors in particular directions from the image center .    because the old ( first epoch ) images have many saturated pixels ,",
    "while the new ( second epoch ) ones do not , we reduced the new images to fit the old images , which avoids any manipulation of the saturated - pixel masks .",
    "the reduction factor was determined by minimization of the square of the difference image rather than by cross - correlation , which we found less sensitive .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty at 25% for the global magnification factor and for the magnification factors along radial lines .",
    "however , since the expansion of the nebula may be asymmetrical , the magnification method can not provide the details of the angular expansion .",
    "thus we made measurements of individual features and took the results of the magnification method as a consistency check . compared to other pne such as ngc  6543 , bd+30 is more diffuse , so it is not possible to measure small regions of only a few pixels in size . to determine the best size of regions for shift measurements , we tested the effects of square size on some randomly selected features by plotting the curve of measured shifts against the size of the region .",
    "we found that when the square size was around 20 pixels ( i. e. , 10 pc pixels ) , shifts were the most insensitive to the size of the region .",
    "we therefore adopted 20 @xmath9 20 pixel squares for the measurements .",
    "the basic compare - and - fit strategy used here is just like what is used to produce a cross - correlated image .",
    "first , move one image by , for example , pixels in the @xmath10 direction and pixels in the @xmath11 direction . then compare and quantify the difference by summing up the squares of differences of corresponding pixels as in a least - squares fit .",
    "this gives the value of the point in the least - squares image .",
    "finally , find the minimum of the least - squares image by gaussian 2-d fitting .",
    "this position gives the relative shift between two features .",
    "care must be exercised in the treatment of the edges of the squares , since almost all regions cut from the original images have non - zero edges ( and the edges of saturated pixel masks are also sharp discontinuities ) .",
    "tapering is not satisfactory , because the regions are very small , as are the shifts ; tapering the edges will drag the measured shifts to zero .",
    "the method we employed was to treat the 20 pixel square , combined with the saturated pixel mask within the square region , as a window .",
    "we first moved the second epoch image , which contained no saturated pixels , then looked at both images through that window , and compared the visible parts by least squares . to simplify the process , idl routines were developed which can select small regions from images interactively , and calculate the shifts automatically .",
    "we used the magnification method at two levels , one for whole image , another along every radial line at 10@xmath4 intervals from 0@xmath4 to 360@xmath4 .",
    "numerical fitting for the whole image gave magnification factors of 0.99384 for h@xmath0 and 0.99361 for [ ] .",
    "the results from radial line magnification are shown in fig .",
    "[ magniflines ] . as mentioned above ,",
    "one criterion of alignment was to make the angular distribution of magnification as symmetrical as possible .",
    "even so , we can still notice that the measured expansion shows some structure .",
    "the expansion is greatest near the openings in the northeastern and southwestern quadrants .",
    "while the distribution of walls and openings is irregular , the smallest expansion seems associated with regions where the shell is brightest .",
    "the direction of greatest expansion is not along the longest axis of the nebula s image ; this may be because the nebula is a tri - axial ellipsoid , with none of the axes aligned with the line of sight , so the expansion might not be aligned along the longest axis of the image .",
    "this might also explain why some features near the center were measured to have inward displacements .",
    "the shifts of nearly 200 features in the h@xmath0 images and the [ ] images are shown in fig .",
    "[ featureh ] and fig .",
    "[ featuren ] , respectively , which illustrates the details of expansion .",
    "again , except for a few features , the results from the two independent wave - bands show a high degree of consistency ( fig .",
    "[ compare ] ) .",
    "the agreement between h@xmath0 and [ ] gives us confidence in the results .",
    "the discrepancies between the two wave - bands may partly be due to slight misalignment , so that the same coordinates in different images might refer to slightly different regions .",
    "in addition , since the ratio of [ ] to h@xmath0 emission varies from point to point within the nebula , there may be real differences in the shifts of features seen in the two wave - bands .",
    "the expansions of the major axis and minor axis of the optical shell are summarized in table [ exptable ] .",
    "the kinematic age of the nebula , defined as @xmath6 , varies somewhat with the method of measuring the expansion as well as from region to region .",
    "a good average value is 800 years .",
    "the magnification factor derived for the whole image gives kinematic ages of 920 and 880 years for h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] , respectively .",
    "the magnification factors along sectors give somewhat smaller ages , and the ages along the minor axis tend to be less than along the major axis .",
    "finally , expansions from feature shifts give the smallest kinematic ages , 740 - 800 years , and are again smallest along the minor axis .",
    "as discussed below , we are particularly interested in the expansion along the position of a spectrographic slit at position angle 99@xmath4 ; the kinematic age along this direction is about 600 years .",
    "if we want to derive the distance of the nebula , some kind of kinematic model  implicit or explicit  must be employed to relate the tangential expansion rate to the expansion velocity along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite recently discussed the kinematics of bd+30 based on ground - based optical emission - line spectra .",
    "they measured the spectra along two slits roughly aligned to the east - west and north - south directions through the center , which , approximately , are the major and minor axes of the nebula . for the modeling of bd+30 , they used a tilted ellipsoidal shell , with a high velocity expanding h@xmath12 ring in the equatorial plane .",
    "furthermore , they found that there is a difference between the low ionization and high ionization regions of this nebula . compared with low ionization regions ,",
    "the high ionization regions are smaller , but have much higher velocities .",
    "they found the expansion velocity along the line of sight to the central star to be @xmath13 km s@xmath3 for [ ] profiles and @xmath14 km s@xmath3 for [ ] profiles .",
    "because the nebula is compact , ground - based long - slit spectra do not have the optimum degree of spatial resolution .",
    "as part of our hst program , we obtained stis spectra with the e230h echelle grating using a @xmath15 x @xmath16 slit .",
    "the grating was set to include the strong ] multiplet @xmath12324.21 , 2325.40 , 2326.11 , 2327.64 and 2328.84 , as well as the [ ] doublet @xmath12470.97 , 2471.09 .",
    "the echelle mode of stis is available only with the ultraviolet mama detector , so substantial dust extinction was unavoidable .",
    "two position angles were observed , 25@xmath4 and 99@xmath4 .",
    "the 25@xmath4 orientation suffers badly from extinction , especially to the north , so we we rely primarily on the 99@xmath4 p.a .",
    "the slit was positioned so that it passed @xmath17 north of the central star to avoid contamination by the stellar continuum .",
    "the location of the 99@xmath4 slit on the h@xmath0 image is shown in fig .",
    "[ slitfit ] . to increase the s / n ratio ,",
    "the spectrum was shifted by 1.53 and added to itself to superimpose c  ii ] 2327.64 and 2326.11 , the two strongest components .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "panel a is the 25@xmath4 orientation and b1 and b2 the 99@xmath4 slit . in this figure",
    ", the top of the slit is to the east .",
    "the [ o  ii ] line appears identical to c  ii ] , but has lower s / n , so we do not discuss it further .",
    "we see that the line has well - defined red and blue components , which yield an accurate expansion velocity .",
    "if the nebula were a uniformly expanding ellipsoid , the echelle profile would be an ellipse  tilted , if the ellipsoid major axis were inclined to the line of sight . while our profile is roughly elliptical , there are clearly local irregularities in the expansion .",
    "panel ( b1 ) shows an ellipse which fits the data reasonably well .",
    "the vertical extent of this ellipse is 494 and the horizontal splitting ( at the center ) is @xmath236.25 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the ellipse is tilted to the right by 5@xmath4 from vertical .",
    "while the splitting seems to be well determined , the tilt of the ellipse is not secure .    but basically , it is a tilted ellipse , which indicates that a tilted ellipsoidal shell is an appropriate model of the nebula .",
    "the lower edge is fainter due to local dust extinction @xcite . since c  ii , like n  ii , is a lower stage of ionization , we were surprised that the expansion velocity of this line was close to the result @xcite found , not for [ n  ii ] , but for the high ionization [ ] line",
    ". perhaps our higher spatial resolution gives a more accurate velocity , while the lower ground - based resolution fills in the profile center , lowering the average velocity .",
    "another consideration is that , although the c@xmath18 ions will avoid the highly ionized central regions , the excitation level of this uv line is high , so the emission will be biased toward the hottest parts of the nebula .",
    "because the expansion velocity was only measured along the stis slit , we made measurements of the astrometric shifts of features along that cut .",
    "according to our kinematic model , the tangential expansion is along radial directions , and is linearly proportional to the distance from the center . under these conditions ,",
    "projections of expansion velocities on any axis are proportional to the corresponding projections of distances on that axis .",
    "so for point of the image where the center is at , its expansion velocity satisfy and , and it does not matter which direction you specify as @xmath10 direction .",
    "therefore , we extracted the components of the shifts along the slit for each feature along the cut , and plotting them against the distances to the center of the slit , fitted them to a straight line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ slitfit ] .",
    "the least - squares line goes through the center , which is a good demonstration of symmetry .",
    "obviously , the error of the central point will be large , since its shift should be perpendicular to the slit .",
    "a fit excluding the center three points , which are likely to have large errors , gave almost the same line . in this way",
    ", the expansion rate at the edge of the nebula , which corresponds to the upper and lower edge of the spectral ellipse , was measured to be at @xmath19 away from the center .    if the nebula were a uniformly expanding spherical shell , then the above tangential expansion , combined with the 36.25 km s@xmath3 velocity along the same cut , implies a distance of 1.80 kpc .",
    "there is evidence , however , that the nebula is not spherical . in the next section",
    ", we will attempt to develop a better kinematic model .",
    "bd+30 is optically thick to ionizing radiation ",
    "it is surrounded by a neutral halo @xcite  but the photoionized shell is also geometrically thin ( perhaps because of the pressure of the @xmath20 k x - ray emitting gas which fills the interior of the shell ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the variation in the surface brightness across the nebula contains information about the three dimensional structure of the nebular shell .",
    "since it would be difficult to correct for the internal extinction due to dust which affects the optical images , we have used the 5 and 15 ghz vla radio maps described in @xcite for this analysis .",
    "a similar approach was previously used by @xcite , who modeled the apparent ew elongation and surface brightness variations of bd+30 in terms of an inclined prolate ellipsoid tilted from our line of sight along the ew direction , consistent with a limited kinematic information available at that time .",
    "the relevant equations are developed in the appendix .",
    "the constancy of flux in pie - shaped sectors radiating from the central star supports the idea of complete absorption of the ionizing radiation .",
    "the ratio of the central surface brightness to the total flux indicates that the nebula is elongated along the line - of - sight : the central intensity is substantially less than would be the case for a sphere .",
    "unfortunately , the angular expansion vanishes near the center of the nebula ; what we need is information on the shape of nebula where we have measured the angular expansion .",
    "we can , however , find the shape of the shell along a chosen wedge from the surface brightness distribution ( eq .",
    "we integrated the surface brightness in 25@xmath4 sectors chosen to overlap the region cut by our 99@xmath4 stis slit .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ shell_sect ] .",
    "the values near the central star are very noisy due to the low signal at the wedge apex .",
    "also , near the edge of the nebula , the finite shell thickness invalidates the assumptions of the method .",
    "but overall , the shell seems to be well fit by an ellipse with an axial ratio of 1.5 to 1 along our line - of - sight , as indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ shell_sect ] .",
    "this fit also closely matches the shell distance of 37 in the direction of the central star  the triangle in fig .",
    "[ shell_sect ]  found from the central intensity ( eq .",
    "a1 ) .    in obtaining the shape from eq .",
    "we made the assumption that the front and back surfaces of the shell contribute equally to the surface brightness .",
    "but if we look at the echelle profile , we see that there is a great asymmetry between the front ( blue - shifted ) and back ( red - shifted ) branches .",
    "we might attribute this to dust extinction , and indeed we feel that the relative weakness of the lower ( west ) part of the profile is likely due to dust . but",
    "this can not explain the relative brightness of the upper , red - shifted side of the line , because this radiation comes from the _ back _ side of the nebula : this radiation must suffer at least as much extinction as the weaker blue side .",
    "a slit placed across a uniformly expanding shell in the form of a tilted ellipsoid will result in a spectral line in the form of a tilted ellipse .",
    "( the tilt angle of the major axis in a plot of the line profile will vary depending upon the relative scales of chosen for the x - axis and y - axis .",
    "the ratio of the x displacement of the top of the ellipse to the width of the ellipse on the x - axis is , however , an invariant . ) because the ellipse that best fits our echelle profile seems tilted , we considered the appearance of a tilted ellipsoidal shell .",
    "equation a7 gives the front and back surface brightnesses , which we found , for the parameters relevant here , to differ by up to a factor of two .",
    "we can sum the front and back contributions and apply eq .",
    "a3 to the result , to simulate our analysis of the vla data assuming symmetry .",
    "we find that an ellipsoid of axial ratio 1.56 , tilted by 10@xmath4 , closely resembles an untilted ellipsoid of axial ratio 1.5 .",
    "( such a solution is shown on fig .",
    "[ shell_sect ] as a dashed line . )    since the top of our echelle spectrum seems tilted redward , this would imply an ellipsoid with the near side tilted down ( westward ) .",
    "unfortunately , with such a tilt , it is the front ( approaching , blue - shifted ) side which is brighter at the top ( east ) end of the slit , just the opposite of what is observed . in an attempt to clarify this situation",
    ", we examined the spectra presented by @xcite , who reproduce two spectra taken with an east - west slit ( close to the orientation of our 99@xmath4 slit ) , one in the [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 line and the other in the relatively weak [ n  ii ] @xmath15754 line .",
    "the [ o  iii ] profile is clearly tilted with the east side blueward , _ opposite the apparent tilt of our c  ii ] line .",
    "_ the [ n  ii ] profile also seems to be tilted with the east side blueward , but determination of the tilt is difficult in this case because the parts of the profile corresponding to high velocities are very faint compared to the bright parts at lower velocities .",
    "we find that if we apply the same analysis as above to the stis profile , this time fitting the vla surface brightness and the tilt of the @xcite [ o  iii ] profile , we get a good fit with an ellipsoid of axial ratio 1.56 , with the near end tilted up ( eastward ) by 9.7@xmath4 .",
    "this is the same direction of tilt shown in fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    "we were guided by the c  ii ] profile in setting the central velocity and spatial extent of this fit , since the relatively low resolution of the [ o  iii ] profile provided less constraint .",
    "[ bryce_fit ] shows this predicted profile superimposed on the @xcite data .",
    "while no simple ellipsoidal model seems able to fit these complex data , we feel that this is the best compromise , since it ( a ) fits the vla surface brightness , ( b ) produces a front / back brightness ratio in the same sense as that seen in both the c  ii ] and [ o  iii ] profiles , ( c ) fits the central velocity seen in the c  ii ] profile , and ( d ) fits the direction and magnitude of the tilt seen in the [ o  iii ] line .",
    "the problem is that this model predicts a tilt in the opposite sense to that seen in the c  ii ] line remains . in view of the low s / n of this profile ,",
    "however , its tilt is uncertain .",
    "also , the fact that the ellipsoidal models are only slightly inclined to the line of sight means that irregularities in the shape of the shell can easily change the tilt of the line profiles .",
    "the ultimate goal of our kinematic model is to relate the tangential expansion , as determined by the linear fit in fig .",
    "[ slitfit ] , to the doppler splitting seen in the echelle spectrum . the model discussed above ",
    "a tilted ellipsoid with a 1.56 axial ratio  has a tangential to radial velocity ratio of 0.667 .",
    "this reduces our estimate of the distance to bd+30 to 1.20 kpc .",
    "the error attached to this distance is hard to estimate . the formal error in the linear fit to the astrometric shifts along the slit is less than 10% , and the error in the expansion velocity smaller yet .",
    "this implies an error of about 10% in the distance , but _ only if we have an accurate kinematic model .",
    "_    it is clear that the shape and kinematics have an important but somewhat uncertain impact on our derived distance , almost surely reducing the value significantly below the spherical value , but by an amount that must remain somewhat uncertain .",
    "progress might be made by a program of extensive kinematic mapping with multiple narrow slits  preferably in the infrared to minimize the effects of extinction by internal dust .",
    "we should also bear in mind that all the foregoing analysis is based on the assumption that the expansion of the nebula is radial , and with a velocity proportional to the distance from the center  such an expansion will preserve the shape of the nebula . while this is a reasonable and conservative assumption , it is not hard to imagine that there may be more material around the waist of the nebula ( the plane perpendicular to the major axis ) which may impede expansion in that direction .",
    "such a situation would reduce the derived distance to the nebula still further .",
    "we have used pairs of hst wfpc images separated by 5.663 years to produce detailed maps of the angular expansion of bd+30 .",
    "images in both h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] show similar patterns of expansion . near the northeastern corner ,",
    "the direction deviations of expansion flow are very regular , and the magnitudes of expansion are also close to each other . if we look at the opening near the northeastern corner , the movements of the material in the inner part tends to move toward the opening , not always along the radial direction .",
    "because measurements were performed on small independent regions , this can not be a systematic error .",
    "it appears that the material in the inner part is trying to go out through the opening , which has relatively low density , instead of moving along a radial direction .",
    "this probably shows that the inner material has a higher velocity than the outer shell .",
    "the west parts of the image do not have very regular patterns over a large scale , but we can still notice some systematic movements .",
    "for example , the expansions along the southwestern direction going outward are almost all along one direction with same magnitude , and there is another convergence center at the southwestern part of the image .",
    "the velocities are particularly large at the outer edge of the southwest quadrant .",
    "it is interesting that the largest proper motions are approximately along the axis of the bipolar outflow as delineated by co `` bullets '' imaged by @xcite , rather than along the ( ew ) major axis .",
    "apparently , measurements of the angular expansion can reveal the `` true '' bipolar axis , consistent with ground - based kinematics .",
    "overall , our measurements are more secure than earlier results , since the high resolution of these images allows us to measure the displacements of small , discrete features  in contrast to the radio work , which could only measure the global expansion . a comparison of proper motions listed in table 2 with the radio expansion measured by @xcite shows a good agreement , but both measurements are significantly larger than the radio expansion determined by @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two radio proper motion measurements arises from a correction used by @xcite to account for the decreasing surface brightness of bd+30 as it expands at an assumed constant luminosity .",
    "the present measurements confirm the validity of this correction , which must be applied if an optically thick nebula is observed with an instrument whose spatial resolution is comparable to the size of the object .",
    "while the hst spatial resolution is superior with respect to the existing radio observations , a rather remarkable agreement with measurements of @xcite demonstrate that ground based radio observations can provide reliable proper motions for compact pne .",
    "although our stis spectra have rather poor s / n , their high spatial resolution gives us a precise measure of the expansion of the brightest part of the nebular shell in a well defined location .",
    "this velocity data can be combined with the astrometric shifts along the same cut to derive a distance . here ,",
    "the greatest uncertainty is the shape and kinematics of the nebula : how elongated is the shell and how uniform and radial is the expansion ?",
    "we have used the radio surface brightness to address the shape , but we have had to assume uniform radial expansion  even though our maps of angular expansion show clear non - radial motions is some sectors .",
    "still , we feel that our resulting distance determination of 1.2 kpc is better justified than previous distance estimates , and offers an improvement over the most recent value of @xmath21 kpc found by @xcite from radio expansion measurements combined with the ground - based kinematic data .    at a distance of 1.2 kpc ,",
    "the luminosity of the central star of bd+30 is equal to 4250  l@xmath5 , following the recent determination of @xcite based on modeling of the stellar spectrum .",
    "( this is 60% lower than the luminosity based on the earlier model of @xcite . )",
    "most of the stellar radiation is absorbed within the nebula , primarily by dust in the neutral halo ( the infrared luminosity is 2000  l@xmath5 ) and in the photoionized shell ( nebular models indicate that @xmath22  l@xmath5 is required to account for the observed radio continuum ) .",
    "the mostly neutral nebular mass is equal to 0.13 m@xmath5 , based on the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath23 m line luminosity derived from the infrared space observatory ( iso ) measurements of this line flux @xcite and the 1.2 kpc distance . in terms of its mass and luminosity , bd+30 is not exceptional among galactic pne .",
    "but its central wolf - rayet wc star is hydrogen poor and iso observations revealed the presence of crystalline silicate dust in this carbon - rich nebula @xcite , signaling a recent change from the oxygen- to carbon - dominated chemistry .",
    "the origin of these rapid abundance variations is not understood at present .",

    "to the extent that the temperature in the nebular gas is constant , and if we neglect the secondary effects of diffuse radiation produced within the gas , the emission in a hydrogen recombination line or in the free - free continuum will depend only upon the flux of stellar ionizing radiation that is absorbed in the volume of gas . consider a nebular shell which is optically thick to ionizing radiation but which is geometrically thin .",
    "then , the emission from the surface of the shell will simply be proportional to the solid angle of the surface element as seen from the central star .",
    "consider an element of the shell @xmath24 which is inclined so that the angle between the normal to the surface and our line - of - sight is @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the angle between the radial vector from the star and the normal to @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath24 will appear to have a surface brightness @xmath26 of @xmath27}^2\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the total flux from the whole nebula , @xmath29 is the distance of @xmath24 from the central star , and @xmath30 is the distance from the nebula to the observer . near the central star , where @xmath31 , the ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath28 provides the distance of the surface from the star ( in angular units : ( r / d ) radians ) .",
    "one complication is that we see both the front and back sides and must separate these contributions or assume symmetry . from the central surface brightness of the radio frequency images ,",
    "it is apparent that the nebula is elongated along the line - of - sight , since the central intensity is substantially less that would be the case for a sphere .",
    "we find ( r / d ) to be at least @xmath32 ; extrapolation to zero radius of the flux in rings about the center yields @xmath33 .",
    "consider a spherical coordinate system whose origin is the central star , with the z - axis directed towards the observer .",
    "call the azimuthal angle @xmath34 and the angle between the z - axis and the vector to a point on the surface @xmath35 .",
    "the flux in any pie - shaped section of the image , bounded by angles @xmath36 and @xmath37 , must be @xmath38 , because that part of the image arises from the absorption of the fraction of the stellar flux emitted into the volume bounded by the planes @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , this provides a check on our assumption that the nebula is optically thick and that diffuse nebular radiation is not important : equal pie - shaped segments of the radio image should have the same flux .",
    "this check is satisfied to within  5% , except for a sector at p.a .",
    "@xmath41 , where there is deficit of 11% .",
    "( we use the radio images because the h@xmath0 images are affected by dust absorption / scattering . )",
    "unfortunately , the angular expansion vanishes near the center of the nebula ; what we want is information on the shape of nebula where we have measured the angular expansion .",
    "let @xmath42 be the ( projected ) angular distance of a bit of the surface @xmath24 from the star .",
    "then the flux in the image segment between @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] is equal to the product @xmath45 there are two contributions to @xmath26 : radiation from the front and back surfaces .",
    "we assume that we can separate them or that they are equal .",
    "so @xmath26 here refers just to the front or back surface . the emitting piece of surface is located at the ( unknown ) angle @xmath35 from the star .",
    "the flux emitted by the surface is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the solid angle subtended by the surface as seen from the star .",
    "@xmath48 , so that the flux is @xmath49\\sin(\\theta)~d\\phi~d\\theta$ ] . by equating fluxes",
    "we can write @xmath50    consider a thin segment of the nebula between @xmath34 and @xmath51 . integrate the expression above from an angle @xmath35 , corresponding to some impact parameter @xmath42 , to @xmath52 , corresponding to @xmath53 .",
    "( @xmath52 is the plane passing through the star and perpendicular to the line - of - sight . if the nebula is expanding radially , then this is the plane with zero radial velocity . )",
    "we find that @xmath54    the expression on the right hand side is just the integrated flux from the azimuthal segment ( from back or front shell only ) , divided by @xmath55 .",
