    "is observed , which can be of even 12 orders of magnitude in blends of poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( peo / pmma ) for extreme dilution of peo @xcite . in such conditions",
    "the motion of the chains of the fast component takes place in a slowly relaxing matrix formed by the slow component , providing a connection with the problem of confinement in host media with interconnected voids .",
    "we have recently performed an investigation on the structural relaxation dynamics of a simple bead - spring model for polymer blends @xcite .",
    "the introduction of monomer size disparity between the two components induces a large time scale separation for low concentrations of the fast component , which displays unusual relaxation features .",
    "hence , density - density correlators exhibit logarithmic decays over time intervals of even four decades and a concave - to - convex crossover by varying the thermodynamic state point ( i.e. , the control parameters ) or the wave vector @xcite .",
    "dynamic features observed for this simplified model are supported by recent fully atomistic simulations on the blend peo / pmma @xcite .",

    "higher - order mct transitions were initially predicted by schematic models @xcite , and later derived for simplified models of short - ranged attractive colloids @xcite .",
    "these systems show two different mechanisms for dynamic arrest : steric repulsion characteristic of colloidal systems , and formation of reversible bonds , induced by the short - ranged attraction .",
