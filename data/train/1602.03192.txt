    "the considerable evidence for late time acceleration of the expansion of the universe has also accelerated considerations of cosmologies other than the conventional @xmath4cdm cosmology and new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "inherent in many of these alternative cosmologies and new physics is the possibility that fundamental constants such as the proton to electron mass ratio @xmath0 and the fine structure constant @xmath2 may roll with time .",
    "the cosmological implications of such variations in time has previously been discussed in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite , therefore the emphasis here is on the implications for new physics .",
    "variations of @xmath0 and @xmath2 requires variations in basic physics parameters such as the quantum chromodynamic scale , @xmath5 , the yukawa couplings , @xmath6 and the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath7 .",
    "the expected time scales for a variation of the constants is on the order of a hubble time which points to astronomical observations as the natural mode for detecting any change .",
    "the implication of a change in @xmath2 for the parameters has been previously explored in ref .",

    "a limit on the variation of @xmath0 at a redshift of 0.89 establishes the stability of @xmath0 to a part in @xmath8 over a time period of a bit more than the last half of the age of the universe .",
    "combined with the limits on ( or observation of ) a change in @xmath2 these observations define the allowed parameter space for deviations from the standard model of physics , a subject with few observational constraints . in section  [ s - maobs ] the current observational limits on the fractional variations of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are discussed followed by the development of the relation betwen the fractional variation of @xmath0 and the fractional variations of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "the previously determined relation of @xmath2 is introduced to produce a set of two independent equations for the variation of th three parameters and the possiblity of a third independent relationship is discussed .",
    "astronomical spectroscopic observations that set limits on the variation of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are generally observations of cold gas in damped lyman alpha clouds ( dlas ) that lie along the line of sight to a quasar .",
    "this gas produces absorption lines that are generally narrow and whose wavelengths can be established with reasonable accuracy . as its name implies ,",
    "@xmath2 measurements are made by observing atomic fine structure transitions in several different elements .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 , on the other hand , involve searching for shifts in the spectra of molecular species such as molecular hydrogen ref .  @xcite . while the @xmath2 observations are all at optical wavelengths the @xmath0 measurements include both optical and radio observations .",

    "the constraints on the variance of @xmath0 therefore determine how far the new theories can stray from the standard model .",

    "this is because the proton mass is assumed to be proportional to a factor given by @xmath28 .",

    "when the logarithmic derivatives are taken on both sides the powers become the coefficients and therefore must add to one as they do in ref .  @xcite .",

    "the far right hand term in each of the relations represents the current observational constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "equations  [ eq - mucon ] and  [ eq - ah ] are two equations in the three unknowns @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . as such they allow the ellimination of one of the variables but the resultant is still the combination of two of the unknowns",
    ". a third independent equation would allow the separation of the unknowns into three separate constraints on the individual parameters .",
    "a possibility is the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath44 which can be expressed in a taylor series expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "hyperfine splitting , such as observed in the 21 cm line is dependent on @xmath44 along with @xmath2 and @xmath0 which could provide an observational channel for the third equation .",
    "fundamental constants such as @xmath0 and @xmath2 are sensitive monitors of possible changes in time of the basic laws of physics . both involve complex physics that have many components and inter - relationships such that the variance of any of the parameters can not be considered in isolation from the rest .",
    "the fundamental constants , however , are pure numbers and changes in those numbers are unambiguous and measurable . if the standard model relationships between the fundamental constants and the dimensionfull parameters are maintained fractional changes in the constants establish quantitative connections to fractional changes in the parameters .",
    "this work provides the connection between fractional changes in @xmath0 and a combination of fractional changes in the quantum chromodynamic scale , the higgs vacuum expectation energy and the yukawa couplings .",
    "this connection has model dependent parameters as does the previously established connection with fractional changes in @xmath2 .",
    "a third possible constraint involves the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath44 .",
    "three indepedent equations raises the possibility of constraining the three parameters separately . to date",
    "no confirmed change with time has been found for either @xmath0 or @xmath2 on astronomical time scales .",
    "these observational limits then provide quantitative limits on the allowed variance of the combination of parameters but not on the individual parameters themselves .",
    "the observational limits are consistent with the standard model and provide limits on the allowed deviations from that model .",
