    "the spectral energy distribution of many early type galaxies ( etgs ) and spiral galaxy bulges increases to shorter wavelengths in the range from 1200 to 2000  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called uvx or uv upturn ( cf . figure  [ fig : dcc ] ) .",
    "observational evidence shows that uvx increases with stellar metallicity .",
    "@xcite found that etgs with bluer 1550-v colour have larger stellar velocity dispersion @xmath7 and higher absorption line index @xmath8 .",
    "giant elliptical galaxies with large @xmath7 values have [ mg / fe ] index higher than most metal rich stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite reinforces the conclusion of @xcite that metallicity is a fundamental parameter , and that the stronger cases of uvx occur in massive metal rich ( @xmath9 ) etgs .",
    "the launch of the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ) satellite revolutionised the study of the uv emission of galaxies @xcite .",
    "combined _ galex _  and sloan digital sky survey ( _ sdss _ , @xcite ) observations have revealed that a substantial fraction ( @xmath10 30% ) of etgs exhibit strong nuv and fuv emission , consistent with residual star formation @xcite , and that only a small percentage ( @xmath10 5% ) of etgs shows the classical uvx @xcite .",
    "using galex colours combined with sauron spectroscopy , and rejecting galaxies with recent star formation , @xcite found that galaxies with bluer fuv - v colour have stronger mg__b _ _ and lower @xmath11 absorption .",
    "this result suggests that galaxies with bluer fuv - v are older or have higher metallicity , or both .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite studying a sample of 150 red and passive coma cluster galaxies with spectroscopic age and estimated element abundances determinations .",
    "they also found a strong correlation of fuv - nuv colour with age and metallicity .",
    "nowadays , the favoured candidate sources for the uvx are extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars and their descendants @xcite .",
    "ehb stars are low - luminosity core he - burning stars with temperatures reaching up to 23000 k and lifetime @xmath12 yr . hence , they are difficult to observe , but they contribute considerably in the uv region of the spectrum , especially in galaxies dominated by old stellar populations like etgs .",
    "ehb stars are observed in galactic globular and open clusters ( e.g. ngc2808 , @xmath13 cen , ngc 6791 ) and among field stars @xcite .",
    "the dwarf elliptical galaxy m32 @xcite is the only extragalactic stellar system with resolved ehbs .",
    "@xcite observed over 4000 old hot stars in the bulge of m31 and classified them into three classes : post - agb ( p - agb ) stars , post - early agb ( pe - agb ) stars , and agb - manqu stars .",
    "they conclude that the stars detected contribute only about 2% of the total flux in the wfc3/uvis f275w filter , and suggest that the missing stars responsible for this emission are most likely faint ehb stars .",
    "this result indicates that the stars responsible for the uvx have not yet been detected with certainty .",
    "a number of competing mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of ehb stars .",
    "@xcite argue for a single star origin .",
    "the large amount of mass loss during the rgb phase of high metallicity stars leads to a hot , low envelope mass ehb star .",
    "once the star leaves the hb , depending on the envelope mass and the metallicity , the ehb star may skip the agb phase and evolve through a more luminous post - ehb phase : either p - agb , or pe - agb , or agb - manqu .",
    "the presence of ehb stars and the strength of the uvx should then depend strongly on the age and metallicity of the stellar population . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite propose that ehb stars result from the interaction of binary stars through one of three possible channels : common - envelope ( ce ) ejection , stable roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , or two helium white dwarf merger ( 2hewd ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the strength of the uv upturn should depend weakly on the age and metallicity of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "one motivation of the work by @xcite was to distinguish between the single or binary star origin of ehb stars using the uvx in passive etgs .",
    "they favour the metal rich single star origin of these stars .",
    "the main argument against the binary star origin of ehb is the expectation that , at least to some level , the uvx should be a universal phenomenon observable in all etgs , uncorrelated with the age and metallicity of the stellar population .    in this paper",
    "we explore to what extent stellar population synthesis models that include the formation of ehb stars through binary star interactions can explain the uvx in etgs .",
    "in ( hereafter , hb13 ) we presented such a model and showed that it can explain successfully the observed colour - magnitude diagram of the metal - rich galactic open cluster ngc 6791 . confirmed ehb stars are present in this cluster .",
    "if we consider the stellar population in this cluster archetypal of the stellar population in etgs that show uvx , then our model should be adequate to study the uv upturn in etgs . in ",

    "this is consistent with the @xmath10 25% of type ii agn found by @xcite in their etg sample .",

    "this behaviour can be explained by the presence of either ehb stars , hot evolved stars , or young massive stars in different proportions in each galaxy .",
    "the slope of the uv spectrum is related to the temperature of the stars emitting in the uv . @xcite",
    "established a colour criterion to classify etgs according to their uv spectral morphology , illustrated in figure  [ fig : dcc ] and summarised in table  [ tab : uv_esq ] .",

    "these percentages are in good agreement with those found by @xcite only if galaxies detected in both the fuv and the nuv are considered , as we do in our sample .",

    "uvx is present in about 20% of non rsf etg s .",
    "it is likely that uvx is also present in a similar fraction of rsf galaxies , but is hidden by the uv emission of young massive main sequence stars present in these galaxies . in the next section",

    "in hb13  we constructed a stellar population synthesis ( sps ) model that includes interacting binary stars .",

    "the most relevant binary star interactions , including rlof , ce , mass transfer , mass accretion , supernova kicks , and angular momentum loss are followed in the bse code .",
    "the occurrence of one or more of these processes depends on the orbital and initial physical parameters of the pair . in the standard version of the bse code , when the 2hewd in a binary pair collide",

    ", we assign physical parameters to the resulting ehb star using the basti data set , based on evolutionary tracks computed with realistic stellar physics by @xcite .",
    "our code then includes ehb stars formed through one of these channels : rlof , or ce , or 2hewd merger .",
    "in hb13  we used our model to explain successfully the observed colour - magnitude diagram of the metal - rich ( @xmath5 ) galactic open cluster ngc 6791 , which contains a significant number of confirmed ehb stars , resulting in a synthetic spectrum with a strong uvx .",
    "if the stellar population in this cluster is archetypal of the stellar population present in uvx galaxies , then our model should be adequate to study the uv upturn in etgs .",
    "see hb13  for details .",
    "observational evidence shows that etgs exhibit different degrees of uv emission ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : dcc ] ) . in this section",
    "we examine the range of values covered by the uv colours and uvx as we vary the hb13  model input parameters . in these models",
    "the rate of ehb star formation is controlled by the following parameters : ( _ a _ ) fraction of binary stars ( bf ) , ( _ b _ ) initial mass function ( imf ) , and ( _ c _ ) stellar metallicity ( @xmath6 ) . unless stated otherwise , models discussed below represent ssps computed for the @xcite imf , the @xcite spectral type dependent bf , and the solar metallicity ( @xmath4 ) @xcite binary star evolutionary tracks .",
    "the imf extends from 0.1 to 100 @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , a binary pair is characterised by its orbital period ( @xmath35 ) , orbit eccentricity ( @xmath36 ) , and mass ratio ( @xmath37 ) . as in hb13",
    "we assume that @xmath36 and @xmath38 are distributed uniformly , following @xcite , and @xcite , respectively , and that @xmath35 follows the gaussian distribution ( in _ logp _ ) found by @xcite , with @xmath39 = 4.4 , and , where _ p _ is measured in days . in the tests below the distributions of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38",
    "are kept fixed .      since in the hb13  models",
    "all ehb stars are formed via binary star interactions , the resulting number of ehb stars depends on the value of bf characterising the population .",
    "to study the influence of bf on the uv colours of the model population , we computed hb13  models for the following values of bf : ( _ a _ ) bf=0 , all stars are single ; ( _ b _ ) bf=0.05 , 5% of the stars are in binary systems ; ( _ b _ ) bf=0.15 , 15% of the stars are in binary systems ; ( _ b _ ) bf=0.3 , 30% of the stars are in binary systems ; ( _ c _ ) bf=0.5 , 50% of the stars are in binary systems ; ( _ d _ ) bf = lada , bf depends on spectral type following @xcite ; and ( _ e _ ) bf=1 , all stars are in binary systems .",
    "the predicted colour evolution is shown by the different lines in figure  [ fig : mosaic]a .",
    "models with bf @xmath40 reproduce the observed colours of etgs in both the uv - weak and uv - strong regions of the uv@xmath32cd .",
    "it is significant that a minimum bf is required to reproduce these colours .",
    "the colours of etgs catalogued as rsf can not be reproduced , not even for bf = 1 .",
    "@xcite developed a spectral synthesis model that includes all phases of single star evolution , from the zams to the white dwarf phase .",
    "they find that for the bulk of etgs @xmath10 5% of the stars on the hb are ehb stars , whereas for uvx galaxies this fraction reaches @xmath10 20% , which is not far from our results .",
    "@xcite determined that at least 40% of the evolved stars in ngc 6791 have lost enough mass on the rgb phase to avoid the helium flash , and @xcite established that in ngc 6791 bf @xmath10 25 - 35% .",
    "these results suggest that bf is not the same in all stellar systems .      the rate of production of atypical stars by interacting binary pairs , like ehb stars or blue stragglers , depends on the frequency of progenitors in the appropriate mass range , which is determined by the imf .",
    "the probability to form a binary system that will evolve into two hewd will be higher for those imfs richer in their progenitors .",
    "thus , despite the narrow mass range ( 0.4 - 0.65 @xmath34 ) of the progenitors of ehb stars formed through the 2hewd merger channel , we expect a slight dependence of the number of these stars on the imf .    figure  [ fig : mosaic]b shows the colour evolution of models computed with the @xcite and the @xcite imfs . for both imf s",
    "the models reproduce the range of colours of passively evolving etgs in the uv weak and uv strong regions of the uv@xmath32cd .",
    "the chabrier imf model colours are bluer in nuv-_r_. the frequency of ehb progenitors is higher for the chabrier than for the salpeter imf .",
    "the salpeter imf yields a higher number of stars with mass below 1 @xmath34 than the chabrier imf .",
    "the number of ehb formed by binary interactions should not depend on stellar metallicity , but only on the distribution of the orbital parameters of the pairs @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the influence of metallicity on these models is neither completely addressed nor fully evaluated , because even if the formation of the binary systems does not depend on metallicity , the subsequent evolution of the ehb star does .",
    "the physical parameters of ehb stars in our models are derived from the basti data set , which does include the metallicity dependence .",
    "figure  [ fig : mosaic]c shows the colour evolution of models computed for @xmath41 , and 0.03 .",
    "as expected , high @xmath6 models ( @xmath5 and 0.02 ) reproduce well the colours of uv weak and uv strong etgs .",
    "the @xmath42 model is slightly bluer than the @xmath4 model .",
    "thus , the hb13  models predict a correlation between the strength of uvx and metallicity .",
    "the @xcite code does not allow to compute tracks for @xmath43 .",
    "subsolar models ( @xmath44 and 0.004 ) are bluer in ( nuv-_r _ ) because of the presence of blue hb stars resulting from the evolution of single stars .",
    "although most of the etgs in our sample are located in the uv weak and uv strong regions of the uv@xmath32cd , approximately 43% of the galaxies are located in the rsf region .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report observational evidence that the blue nuv-_r _ colour of these galaxies is due to residual star formation within the last 1 gyr .",
    "in particular , @xcite concludes that etgs with blue uv colours are morphologically perturbed and that these colours are driven by merger - induced star formation within the last 3 gyr .",
    "galaxies with nuv-@xmath45 can not be explained in terms of the hb13  ssp models discussed in the previous subsections and shown in figures  [ fig : mosaic]a , b , c .",
    "models for arbitrary star formation histories are not yet available . to understand the colours of the bluest galaxies in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] , we use the standard bc03 models . the bc03 models do not include binary stars , and lack the ehb star contribution present in the hb13  models .",
    "however , the massive main sequence o - b stars formed in a recent burst of star formation will outshine in the uv the contribution of the ehb formed in the initial burst . in figure",
    "[ fig : mosaic]d we show the path followed in the uv@xmath32cd  by models in which a second burst of star formation occurs when the stars formed in the first burst are 12 gyr old .",
    "different symbols represent bursts of different amplitude , as indicated in the figure .",
    "the standard bc03 ssp model is also shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic]d .",
    "the central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspne ) included in this model are responsible of the uv flux seen at late ages . for comparison",
    "we include an ssp models in which cspne have been suppressed .",
    "this latter model resembles the hb13 model for bf = 0 .    the lowest amplitude burst ( 0.1% ) traverses the uv strong region in figure  [ fig : mosaic]d on its way to bluer colours .",
    "however , the time spent by this model in the uv strong region is quite short , less than 0.15 gyr .",
    "the effects of this burst on the integrated spectrum last for no longer than 0.7 gyr .",
    "therefore , the probability that all etgs catalogued as uv strong have suffered a recent ( in the last @xmath10 0.55 - 0.7 gyr ) and low amplitude ( @xmath10 0.1% of the total mass ) burst is small .",
    "additionally , studies of resolved stars in the bulge of m31 @xcite and in m32 @xcite , do not show the presence of ms stars .",
    "the principal aim of this study is to fill the gap between the classical models ( single star scenario ) to explain the uvx phenomenon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and models that include interacting binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both type of models",
    "the uvx is produced by ehb stars ( he burning stars with @xmath46 23000 k ) .",
    "ehb stars are considered the most likely source of the uvx despite the fact that they are not resolved in extragalactic objects @xcite . in the classical model ,",
    "ehbs are the product of the evolution of high @xmath6 or he enhanced low mass single stars . in the interacting binary models ehb stars are formed via binary interactions through mass transfer , collisions , or mergers .",
    "therefore , the two models make different predictions for the evolution of the uvx in etgs . in the classical model ,",
    "the intensity of the uv flux increases with the age of the stellar population because low mass stars have less gravitationally bound lower mass envelopes , which are easier to lose through mass loss during the rgb evolution , producing blue hb stars . since the mass loss rate increases with @xmath6 , in this model",
    "the uvx is expected to increase with the metallicity of the stellar population . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find such a correlation of uvx with age and metallicity , and conclude that the most probable source of the uvx is evolved low mass stars .",
    "on the other hand , from interacting binary models we do not expect a relation between the uvx and age or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the fuv-_r _ colour is almost constant for age between 3 and 12 gyr . in principle , in these models the uvx is not related to @xmath6 because the formation channel of ehbs depends only on the orbital parameters of the binary pairs .",
    "but , as indicated in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , once the ehb star is formed , its position and subsequent evolution in the hr diagram _ does _ depend on @xmath6 .",
    "the hb13  model predicts that the etgs inside the uv strong region are the oldest ( figure  [ fig : mosaic ] ) .",
    "this result is related to the use of the @xcite evolutionary tracks to assign the physical properties to ehbs formed as a result of a 2hewd merger .",
    "these tracks allow for a narrow range of mass for the ehb stars , form 0.49 to 0.53 @xmath34 . since the mass of the ehb star is the sum of the mass of the two merging wds , the probability of producing an ehb star in the indicated mass range via the 2hewd merger channel increases with time . as shown in figures  [ fig : mosaic]a , b , c , in the hb13  models the uvx phenomenon appears in old stellar populations ( @xmath25 7 gyr ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mosaic]c shows a weak correlation between @xmath6 and the uv colours inside the uv strong region of the uv@xmath32cd .",
    "the @xmath5 model is slightly bluer that the @xmath4 model in the uv strong region .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the evolution in the post - ehb phases would help establishing the reality of these two correlations .",
    "it is important to remark that the hb13  models reproduce all etgs in the sample catalogued as uv weak or uv strong for some choice of bf , @xmath6 , or the imf . the distribution of these parameters , and others like orbital period and mass ratio , and its temporal evolution and dependence with environment remain an unresolved puzzle .",
    "we use the hb13  sps models , which include the evolution of interacting binary stars , as a tool to study the uvx phenomenon observed in etgs .",
    "first we build a sample of etgs with observed optical ( _ sdss_-dr8 ) and uv ( _ galex_-gr6 ) photometry .",
    "following @xcite , we classify the etgs in our sample according to their position in the uv@xmath32cd  as uv weak ( galaxies in the red sequence ) , uv strong ( galaxies with uvx ) , and rsf ( galaxies that have experienced recent episodes of star formation ) .",
    "then , we compare the uv colours of the sample galaxies with the colour evolution lines in this plane predicted by the hb13  models , varying , one at a time , the fraction bf of binary stars , the imf , and the stellar metallicity @xmath6 .    in view of the results discussed in ",
    "[ sec : modelpredictions ] , we conclude that :    * of all parameters tested , the uvx is most sensitive to bf .",
    "varying bf it is possible to reproduce the uv colours of almost all the etgs in the uv weak and uv strong regions of the uv@xmath32cd , as long as bf is above a threshold value of @xmath10 0.15 . *",
    "although the @xcite imf model is slightly bluer in nuv-_r _ than the @xcite imf model , both models are in good agreement with the observed colours of uv weak and uv strong etgs . * higher metallicity models ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) reproduce the colours of uv weak and uv strong galaxies better than low @xmath6 models .",
    "the @xmath5 model is slightly bluer than the @xmath4 model in the uv strong region .",
    "this behaviour seems indicative of a weak relationship between uvx and @xmath6",
    ". the hb stars present in the low @xmath6 models move the integrated nuv-_r _ colour into the rsf region . * the colours of the etgs in the rsf region of the uv@xmath32cd  can not be understood in terms of the hb13  ssp models .",
    "these colours are well reproduced by standard bc03 models , which lack binary stars , when a second burst of star formation is added to the old stellar population .",
    "a burst strength of @xmath10 5% of the total mass of the stellar system suffices to explain the colours of the rsf galaxies .",
    "* the largest values of uvx occur at the oldest age in the model population ( 13 gyr ) .",
    "we would like to stress our last conclusion because the lack of a relation between uvx and age and @xmath6 in models that assume that ehb stars result from binary interactions has been taken as a weakness of these models . despite @xcite remark that these models can not account naturally for the observed trends of uvx with age and metallicity ,",
    "we have shown that the hb13  models predict a clear dependence of uvx with age , and to a lesser extent with @xmath6 .",
    "when the tools to compute the evolution of binary pairs are improved , especially a better coverage of the tracks in the @xmath47 plane , and an adequate treatment of the post - ehb phases of stellar evolution , it will be possible to explore these trends in depth .",
    "in real galaxies ehb stars may form both from single stars and from binary pairs .",
