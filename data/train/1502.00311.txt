    "let @xmath5 denote the closed orientable surface of genus @xmath1 , let @xmath6 denote the associated _ extended mapping class group _ , and let @xmath7 be the set of isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on @xmath8 .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath6 on @xmath7 , and analyzing orbits of various finite subsets of @xmath7 has proven to be a fruitful way of probing the algebra and geometry of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the @xmath6-orbits of pants decompositions have been used to estimate the weil - petersson diameter of the thick part of moduli space @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to explicitly construct many distinct @xmath6-orbits of collections of curves with intersection properties that are reminiscent of pants decompositions .",
    "we show :    1 [ mainthm ] for @xmath9 , there exist at least @xmath10 and at most @xmath11 distinct @xmath6-orbits of collections of @xmath2 simple closed curves pairwise intersecting once .",
    "malestein - rivin - theran have shown that any collection of curves pairwise intersecting once has cardinality at most @xmath2 .",
    "thus we think of such collections as analogous to pants decompositions in the following way : pants decompositions are the maximal cliques of the _ curve graph _ , @xmath12 , of @xmath8 @xmath13 the graph with vertex set @xmath7 , and edges between two isotopy classes that can be realized disjointly on @xmath8 . similarly , the curve systems in theorem [ mainthm ] are the largest cliques of the _ schaller _ or _ systole graph _ , @xmath14 , of @xmath8 , whose vertices correspond to the subset of @xmath15 of non - separating simple closed curves , and whose edges correspond to pairs of curves intersecting exactly once . note that , unlike pants decompositions , there do exist non - maximum collections of curves pairwise intersecting once that are nonetheless maximal with respect to inclusion",
    ".    we remark that the number of @xmath6-inequivalent pants decompositions grows at least factorially in @xmath1 ( see @xcite for an asymptotically precise count ) , and we conjecture that the same is true for the types of curve systems considered here .",
    "however , though @xmath14 and @xmath12 are @xmath6-equivariantly quasi - isometric , it is not necessarily the case that the corresponding growth rates of @xmath6-inequivalent maximal cliques are comparable .",
    "this question requires a more detailed understanding of the specific nature of @xmath14 .",
    "schaller has shown that the automorphism group of @xmath14 is the ( extended ) mapping class group @xcite , and thus as a corollary to theorem [ mainthm ] we obtain :    [ clique ] the number of maximum cardinality cliques of @xmath14 , inequivalent under the action of @xmath16 , grows at least exponentially in @xmath1 .    by a @xmath3-system , we mean any subset @xmath17 consisting of curves pairwise intersecting at most @xmath3 times .",
    "complete _ @xmath3-system is a @xmath3-system in which any two curves intersect _ exactly _ @xmath3 times .",
    "thus the main focus of this paper is the study of complete @xmath18-systems of maximum possible size , or _",
    "maximum complete 1-systems_.    malestein - rivin - theran showed that such @xmath18-systems are unique up to the action of @xmath6 for @xmath19 , and they asked if this uniqueness persists for higher genera .",
    "the first author answered this question by subsequently constructing two distinct orbits of complete @xmath18-systems of size @xmath2 on @xmath8 , for all @xmath20 .",
    "thus we view theorem [ mainthm ] as a further demonstration of the non - uniqueness of maximum complete @xmath18-systems .",
    "note that ` complete'-ness , for the 1-systems we consider , is a significant simplifying assumption .",
    "though there has been substantial recent progress towards estimating the size of maximum 1-systems @xcite , even asymptotically precise counts are not currently available .",
    "while it would be interesting to examine the number of @xmath6-orbits of maximum 1-systems , the absence of any examples when @xmath21 makes this seem difficult - orbits of maximum 1-systems for @xmath22 . ] .",
    "our method of distinguishing @xmath6-orbits of a curve system @xmath23 is to analyze the _ dual cube complex _",
    "@xmath24 to @xmath23 , a complex built from cubes of various dimensions which encodes the combinatorics of the intersections between curves .",
    "this invariant is a useful way of organizing topological information about the @xmath6-orbit of @xmath23 . along the way in our analysis",

    "the induced set map from @xmath29 to @xmath30 corresponds to the induced map between hyperplanes of @xmath31 and hyperplanes of @xmath32 ) .",
    "thus , the reader may view the main result as a construction of many non - isomorphic cube complexes , each dual to a maximum complete @xmath18-system .",
    "in particular , we show :    [ cubereal ] for any even @xmath33 $ ] , there exists a complete @xmath18-system of size @xmath2 on @xmath0 whose dual cube complex has dimension @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether or not the dimension of the cube complex dual to a maximum complete 1-system grows with the genus . at the moment",
    "this problem seems difficult . as a first step",
    ", one might determine whether there exists a maximum complete @xmath18-system @xmath23 whose dual cube complex is @xmath34-dimensional :    [ 2d ] does there exist a maximum complete @xmath18-system whose dual cube complex is @xmath34-dimensional ?    in this case , the quotient of the dual cube complex @xmath24 by the action of @xmath35 produces a square - tiled copy of @xmath8 , with at least @xmath36 squares around each vertex .",
    "we conjecture that the answer to question [ 2d ] is no .    in general , @xmath24 can be a very complicated combinatorial object ; indeed , one may interpret this as a consequence of theorem [ cubechar ] , since @xmath6-orbits of curve systems can be difficult to distinguish ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to leverage @xmath24 to useful information about @xmath6 , we make use of the following simplifying theorem for cube complexes dual to @xmath18-systems :    3 [ 3-to - n ] suppose @xmath37 is any @xmath18-system on an orientable surface @xmath8 , possibly with boundary .",
    "then the dimension of @xmath24 is @xmath38 if and only if the dimension of @xmath39 is @xmath40 , for @xmath41 any triple of curves in @xmath23 .",
    "we note that one direction of theorem [ 3-to - n ] is immediate : if the dimension of the entire cube complex is @xmath38 , then any three curves must correspond to a @xmath40-cube in the dual cube complex .",
    "however , as figure [ necessity1system ] in section [ qualitative info section ] demonstrates , the converse is false if the assumption of being a @xmath18-system is dropped .",
    "our main construction requires @xmath1 to be odd , and we extend the conclusion of theorem [ mainthm ] and proposition [ cubereal ] to even @xmath1 via the following simple process ( see  [ stabilizing ] for a slightly more careful description ) :    beginning with a complete @xmath18-system @xmath23 of size @xmath2 on @xmath0 for @xmath42 , excise a pair of small open disks which are locally on opposite sides of some @xmath43 , and glue on an annulus @xmath44 along the resulting boundary circles .",
    "note that @xmath23 is still a complete @xmath18-system on @xmath45 , and we extend @xmath23 to a collection of @xmath46 curves by adding @xmath47 , defined as follows : both @xmath47 run parallel to @xmath48 in the complement of the new annulus @xmath44 . within @xmath44 , both @xmath47 run from one boundary component of @xmath44 to the other , intersecting once in the interior of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore @xmath47 intersect each other exactly once , within @xmath44 , and each intersects all of the original elements of @xmath23 exactly once because @xmath48 does .",
    "if @xmath23 on @xmath0 is obtained from a complete @xmath18-system @xmath41 on @xmath49 as described above , we call @xmath23 a _ stabilization _ of @xmath41 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether or not _ every _ complete @xmath18-system on @xmath0 of size @xmath2 is obtained from one on @xmath49 of size @xmath50 via this process :    [ stab ] let @xmath23 be a complete @xmath18-system on @xmath0 of size @xmath2 .",

    "we observe that each complete @xmath18-system we construct is indeed a stabilization of a complete @xmath18-system on a lower genus surface .",
    "furthermore , we note that a positive answer to question [ stab ] implies a negative answer to question [ 2d ] : lemmas [ tool1 ] and [ stabilized 3-cubes general 1 ] imply that the dimension of the cube complex dual to any complete @xmath18-system obtained via stabilization is at least three .",
