    "young core - collapse supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the galaxy provide an unique opportunity to study fine details of ejecta from supernova ( sn ) explosions as well as those of the circumstellar medium ( csm ) produced over the final evolutionary stages of massive stars .",
    "an obvious group of such young core - collapse snrs is o - rich snrs that show optical spectra featuring strong o and ne lines , with lines from lighter elements ( e.g. , he ) either weak or absent . since the ejecta from a progenitor and the swept - up csm in the o - rich snrs",
    "are not completely mixed together yet , observation of the o - rich snrs is promising to study the ejecta and csm related to the explosion of a progenitor and its late - stage evolution .",
    "g292.0@xmath11.8 ( msh1154 ) , together with cassiopeia  a and puppis  a , forms a rare group of o - rich snrs in the galaxy .",
    "the o - rich nature of g292.0@xmath11.8  was discovered by the optical detection of fast - moving o - rich and ne - rich ejecta @xcite .",
    "recent wide - field observations of the optical  line in g292.0@xmath11.8  have revealed that the ejecta velocities range from @xmath51400  to @xmath11700  and also that distant ejecta knots are located primarily along the north - south direction @xcite .",
    "the dynamical center of g292.0@xmath11.8 , based on the kinematics of the  line emission from the ejecta , is roughly coincident with the geometrical center of the radio emission , but shows an apparent offset from its pulsar position discovered at the southeast ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the mid - infrared ( mir ) spectrum of the ejecta is dominated by ionic lines and a broad bump around 17  @xmath2 m using the @xmath6 space telescope ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they proposed that the latter is produced either by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) along the line of sight or newly - formed dust within the ejecta . besides there is also an equatorial mir continuum component from the dust associated with the shocked csm partly overlapping with the ejecta emission .",
    "a previous infrared ( ir ) study based on the data obtained with infrared astronomical satellite ( @xmath7 ) , on the other hand , identified enhanced far - ir ( fir ) emission in the southwestern part of the snr , suggesting that the source has encountered adjacent clouds @xcite .    in radio , g292.0@xmath11.8  mainly consists of bright emission from a central pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) of @xmath3  4  ( in diameter ) and relatively fainter outer plateau emission of @xmath3  9  @xcite .",
    "the plateau emission declines sharply outward , and there is no apparent surrounding radio shell structure .",
    "the pulsar psr j11245916 , which is located @xmath346  from the dynamical center of the snr in the southeast direction , was discovered by radio timing @xcite , confirming the pwn nature of the central emission of the snr .",
    "the pulsar and pwn were also identified in x - ray emission @xcite , where the pulsar has a nearby jet and a torus of @xmath3  5  scale @xcite .",
    "the jet axis is slightly tilted to the northeast direction @xcite .",
    "there are two clear differences between the soft and hard x - ray emission of g292.0@xmath11.8 .",
    "first , while the former is produced by shocked gas of normal composition distributed as equatorial filaments , indicating it is likely from csm , the latter is dominated by bright metallic lines from the ejecta @xcite .",
    "next , the x - ray emission is harder in the northwestern part than the southeastern part , implying density variation or asymmetric sn explosion @xcite .",
    "the distance to g292.0@xmath11.8 , on the other hand , was estimated to be 6.2 kpc from h  i absorption observations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an extensive ir study of g292.0@xmath11.8 using multi - band imaging and spectroscopic data obtained with the @xmath0 space telescope @xcite .",
    "we describe the details of our @xmath0 observations and present the results of the observations in  2 and 3 , respectively . in ",
    "4 we discuss ir emission in g292.0@xmath11.8  from circumstellar dust with a comparison to model calculations of dust destruction by a sn shock .",
    "we also discuss the ir emission from the ejecta and we suggest that there is a negligible amount of dust associated with the ejecta .",
    "then , we make a comparison to the results of @xmath6 obserations .",
    "we finally discuss the sn explosion in g292.0@xmath11.8  based on our @xmath0 observations followed by our conclusions in  5 .",
    "the @xmath0 multi - band imaging observations of g292.0@xmath11.8 were carried out using its six near - ir ( nir ) and mir bands in the 2.726.5 @xmath2 m range as well as four fir bands in the 50180 @xmath2 m range on 2007 january 17 and 19 .",
    "the nir and mir images were obtained with infrared camera ( irc ) that has three simultaneously operating nir , mir - s , and mir - l channels .",
    "the three channels have comparable field of views of @xmath8 .",
    "the nir and mir - s channels share the same pointing direction , while that of the mir - l channel is 25  away .",
    "the irc observations were conducted in the two - filter mode that produced images of two bands for each channel @xcite .",
    "the total on - source integration times were 178  s for the nir ( n3 , n4 ) observations and 196  s for both the mir - s ( s7 , s11 ) and mir - l ( l15 , l24 ) observations .",
    "the basic calibration and data reduction , including dark subtraction , linearity correction , distortion correction , flat fielding , image stacking , and absolute position determination were performed by the standard irc imaging data reduction pipeline ( version 20071017 ) .",
    "tables  [ tab_obssum ] and [ tab_obsimg ] present a journal of our @xmath0 observations , including the spectroscopic observations , and the basic parameters of the @xmath0 imaging bands , respectively .    the fir images were obtained with far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) in two round - trip scans using the cross - scan shift mode @xcite .",
    "the scan speed and length were 15  s@xmath9 and 240 , respectively , creating images of 40  @xmath10 12  size elongated along the scanning direction .",
    "all the four fis band ( n60 , wide - s , wide - l , and n160 ) images were obtained simultaneously by a single observing run ( table  [ tab_obssum ] ) .",
    "the initial data calibration and reduction such as glitch detection , dark subtraction , flat fielding and flux calibration were processed with fis slow - scan toolkit ( version 20070914 ) , and the final image construction was performed with a refined sampling mechanism .",
    "these irc and fis multi - band imaging observations were followed by nir and mir spectroscopic observations and l18w - band ( 13.925.6 @xmath2 m , combining both l15 and l24 bands ) imaging observations carried out in 2007 july 2022 . the spectroscopic observations were conducted using four ( ng , sg1 , sg2 , and lg2 ) grisms .",
    "similar to the aforementioned imaging observations , the ng , sg1 , and sg2 mode observations were conducted simultaneously , while lg2 mode observations were done separately @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab_obssp ] lists the characteristics of the @xmath0 spectroscopic observations .",
    "spectra from the peaks of the equatorial emission and ejecta identified in the ratio between the l15- and l24-band images ( l15/l24 hereafter ) were obtained together with that from a reference background position at the southeastern part of the source ( table  [ tab_sppos ] ) .",
    "the data calibration and reduction were processed with irc spectroscopy toolkit ( version 20070913 ) .",
    "the obtained flux was converted to the surface brightness based on the measured slit size .",
    "irc spectroscopy is made at the slits located at the edge of the large imaging field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "there is internal scattered light in the array of the mir - s and the light diffusing from the imaging fov affects sg1 and sg2 spectra to some extent .",
    "this effect has been corrected for according to the method given in @xcite .",
    "a similar scattered light is also recognized in lg2 spectra and has been corrected for in a similar way .",
    "in addition there is a contribution from the second order light from the edges of the imaging fov in lg2 spectra , but we expect that it is not significant in the background - subtracted spectra .",
    "these spectroscopic observations were simultaneously accompanied by supplemental short ( 49  s @xmath10 3 ) l18w - band imaging observations of a field @xmath3  5  away from the central slit position in the southeast direction in order to check the pointing of the satellite .",
    "this supplemental , short - exposure l18w - band image of the southeast , which fortuitously revealed interesting structures beyond the snr boundary ( see   3.4 ) , was combined with deep ( 442  s ) l18w - band image of the source to generate a final larger - area map .",
    "the l18w - band imaging data were processed with the same procedures that we used for other imaging data sets as described above .",

    "the @xmath0 ir emission associated with the snr is most apparent in the l15- and l24-band images as two prominent features : first , there is a ring - like structure composed of two clumpy , narrow , and long filaments crossing the central part of the snr along the east - west direction ",
    "we name this  equatorial ring \" ( er ) ; secondly , the outer boundary of the snr appears as an almost - complete shell structure with its eastern part opened  we name this  outer elliptical shell \" ( oes ) .",
    "the radius of the er is @xmath3 3@xmath4 ( or @xmath3 5 pc ) .",
    "its southern filament is brighter than the northern one by a factor of @xmath12 on average and has the brightest clump at ( ra , decl . )",
    "= ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) close to the filament center .",
    "the southern filament also shows prominent x - ray and [ ] emission and has been called  equatorial bar \" or  equatorial belt \" @xcite .",
    "the northern filament is @xmath3  1  away from the southern filament and both filaments are elongated roughly parallel to each other .",
    "the oes shows an almost - complete ellipse of @xmath3 7  @xmath10 6  ( @xmath3 12 pc @xmath10 10 pc ) with its major axis aligning roughly with the plane of the er . the center of the ellipse determined by elliptical fits weighted by the 24 @xmath2 m surface brightness of the oes is ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) located at the middle of two filaments of the er . in the west the oes appears to be connected with the two filaments of the er and its emission is enhanced there , especially at the southwest near the southern filament of the er . in contrast the eastern part of the oes is open , and also the emission from the southern filament of the er is truncated in the east before it reaches the boundary of the snr .",
    "in addition to the er and oes , there appear to be at least two more clearly identifiable features in the @xmath0 images .",
    "first , the l15-band image shows a separate structure that extends @xmath3 5@xmath4 southward from the er on the southeastern side of the snr .",
    "it is elongated vertically with the bright portion located @xmath3 0.5@xmath4 below the southern equatorial filament .",
    "next , there is faint emission extending beyond the northern and southeastern edges of the oes .",
    "this faint emission is contained within the outermost boundary of radio emission observed in g292.0@xmath11.8 @xcite .",
    "as in figure  [ fig_irc ] , g292.0@xmath11.8  is not detected in the s7- and s11-band images : while some of the s11-band emission appears to arise from locations of strong l15- and l24-band emission , there is almost no corresponding emission in the s7-band image .",
    "this suggests that the s7-band emission is dominated by background emission , probably emission from pahs in the line of sight interstellar medium ( ism ) . in the s11s7 difference image ( figure  [ fig_irc ] ) we subtract out scaled s7-band emission from the s11-band image and confirmed that the two filaments of the er and southwestern part of the oes have appreciable s11-band emission .",
    "( note that the three bright point - like sources close to the eastern end of the southern filament of the er in the s11s7 difference image are stellar sources . )",
    "the nir n3- and n4-band images , on the other hand , show only stellar emission without any apparent feature brighter than 16 @xmath2jy at 3 @xmath2 m that might be associated with the snr .",
    "table  [ tab_f ] presents ir measurements of g292.0@xmath11.8 . in the table",
    ", we list the fluxes and ratios of whole remnant area and ir - ejecta region ( see befow for ir - ejecta ) .",
    "in addition , we also list the peak intensities and ratios of the er , the southweastern oes , and the ir - ejecta .      figure  [ fig_cmap ] ( left ) , which is a three - color ( 7 , 15 and 24 @xmath2 m ) @xmath0 mir image of g292.0@xmath11.8 , shows that most of the prominent features have roughly similar mir colors .",
    "one exception is the feature in the southeastern part of the snr with significant excess in the shorter wavebands  we name this feature  ir - ejecta \" because it is believed to originate in shocked sn ejecta as we describe below .",
    "it is bright near the southern equatorial filament and stretching directly southward beyond the snr boundary .",
    "this feature is clearly seen in figure  [ fig_cmap ] ( right ) which shows the l15/l24 emission ratio .",
    "the ratio image was produced by dividing the l15-band image by the l24-band image after background subtraction .",
    "the background was estimated by fitting a slanted plane to the areas surrounding the snr .",
    "the resulting background planes were almost flat , i.e. , the brightness differences over the entire images were only 1.7 % and 2.4 % in l15 and l24 , respectively .",
    "we applied a gaussian convolution to the l15-band image in order to match the final spatial resolution to that of the l24-band image and masked out the pixels with small ( @xmath17 30.2 mjy sr@xmath9 ) l24-band intensities .",
    "the resulting l15/l24 color image is significantly different from the original band images . in figure",
    "[ fig_cmap ] , the l15/l24 ratio is almost uniform ( @xmath3 0.25 ) , and there is no feature corresponding to the prominent er and oes . the most notable feature is the ir - ejecta , where l15/l24 ratio raises to @xmath3  0.8 , which is in fact consistent with what we identified in the three - color image ( left panel of figure  [ fig_cmap ] ) .",
    "it appears to be of a triangular shape with one of its vertices towards the direction to the snr center .",
    "the southern vertex passes though the southern boundary of the oes and extends over the snr boundary , while the northeastern vertex is located just above the er . the region of high color ratio of the ir - ejecta covers a large portion of the southeastern area of the snr and positionally coincides with the o- and ne - dominant ejecta identified by previous optical and x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "there is also a wispy patch of emission around ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) far ( @xmath20 1 ) beyond the snr boundary , which has the color ratio similar to that of the ir - ejecta .",
    "it , however , is not shown in the [ ] images @xcite . besides the ir - ejecta in the southeastern region , the northwestern region shows extended emission of the high color ratio , although it is not as significant as the southeastern region .",
    "overall the two regions of the high color ratio are roughly symmetric with respect to the center of the oes .",
    "figure  [ fig_cplot ] compares the pixel values of the l24- and l15-band emission , where most of the points are distributed along the thick , solid line of a slope of 0.25 .",
    "( note that pixels of stars and pixels with small l24-band intensities are masked out . )",
    "if l24- and l15-band fluxes are from the same region and if they are both thermal dust emission , then the color ratio and the dust temperatures are related as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the surface brightness at @xmath23 ( @xmath2 m ) in jy sr@xmath9 , @xmath24 is the planck function , and @xmath25 is the dust opacity in @xmath26 g@xmath9 .",
    "the slope of 0.25 corresponds to the dust temperature of 126  k for a mixture of carbonaceous and silicate interstellar grain of @xmath27 = 3.1 @xcite . in figure  [ fig_cplot ]",
    "there are two regions , where the data points show a high l15/l24 ratio compared to the thick , solid line : first , the thin line of the slope of 0.88 represents one group whose l24-band surface brightness is less than @xmath3  33  mjy  sr@xmath9 ; secondly , there is another group of data points of higher l15-band emission whose l24-band surface brightness lies in the range of 3340 mjy  sr@xmath9 .",
    "the inset in the lower - right corner of figure  [ fig_cplot ] shows that the data points with high l15/l24 ratios are all from the ir - ejecta as expected .",
    "the ones in the second group , i.e. , ones with high 24 @xmath2 m surface brightness , are superposed on the er and therefore their emission is partly from the swept - up csm while the data points in the first group should represent the emission only from the ejecta . the slope of 0.88 corresponds to a dust color temperature of 240 k ; however the l15-band flux is largely from line emission at this position so that the physical dust temperature should be lower than this ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec ] shows the background - subtracted mir grism spectra of the peak positions of the er and the ir - ejecta .",
    "( note that the lg2 spectra at @xmath20 17 @xmath2 m were obtained from positions slightly shifted from those of the sg spectra of 514 @xmath2 m as we described in   2 . )",
    "the spectrum from the ir - ejecta peak clearly shows the [ ] line at 12.8 @xmath2 m , which confirms the nature of the radiatively shocked ejecta .",
    "no ar lines ( i.e. , [ ] at 7.0 @xmath2 m and [ ] at 9.0 @xmath2 m ) were detected , while neither [ ] line at 15.6 @xmath2 m nor [ ] line at 25.9 @xmath2 m was covered .",
    "table  [ tab_line ] lists the flux of the [ ] line and upper limits of the [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "the flux of the [ ] line at 12.8 @xmath2 m is 2.8@xmath282.5@xmath1010@xmath29 erg @xmath30 s@xmath9 sr@xmath9 , corresponding to the surface brightness of 0.24@xmath280.21 mjy  sr@xmath9 in the l15-band image . given the l15-band surface brightness of 1.6@xmath280.1 mjy  sr@xmath9 , @xmath3  15  % of the l15-band emission is due to the [ ] line emission . for the s11 band ,",
    "the observed [ ] line emission flux corresponds to the s11-band surface brightness of 0.12@xmath280.11 mjy  sr@xmath9 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath3  55  % contribution to the total s11-band emission , which is much larger than the case of the l15-band emission .",
    "the difference is because there is no strong emission line other than the [ ] line in the s11 band while there is additional [ ] 15.5 @xmath2 m line in the l15 band ( see the spectral responses in figure  [ fig_spec ] ) .",
    "( there could be some dust emission too .",
    "see   4.3 . ) on the other hand , the spectrum at the er peak is dominated by the continuum emission , although the lg2 spectra have a lower signal to noise ratio .      figure  [ fig_ircw ] presents a combined l18w - band image (   2 ) covering both the snr and an extended area in the southeast . besides the features of the snr that we already described in previous sections ,",
    "there is a notable feature of the l18-band emission in the south . the elongated  narrow tail \" is located around ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , @xmath3  7  apart from the center of the snr .",
    "it is close to the ir - ejecta in the southeastern part of the snr and its elongation direction is roughly towards the center of the snr .",
    "its extent is @xmath33 or 2.6 pc .",
    "in addition , there is faint , diffuse emission toward the south and southeast too .",
    "the emission toward the southeast appers distinct - it appears to protrude from the open portion of the oes having similar outer boundary with radio plateau at the east and south , but extends @xmath34 southeast beyond the radio boundary of the snr .",
    "we consider that this  wide tail \" could be associated with the snr .",
    "there is large , diffuse region superposed on g292.0@xmath11.8 on the sky ( rcw 54 ; rodgers et al . 1960 ) , but its h@xmath35 emission is elongated along the northeast - southwest direction without any emission corresponding to the wide tail in the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the wide tail is not associated with regions and its association with the snr is likely .",
    "figure  [ fig_fis ] presents the @xmath0 fis fir - band images of g292.0@xmath11.8 .",
    "the images cover the entire snr with a scan direction of northeast to southwest . the fir emission of the snr associated with the er and oes is clearly detected in the n60- and wide - s - band images with strong concentration in the southwestern part , although fine details are difficult to see because of their low spatial resolutions .",
    "the n160- and wide - l - band images are , however , clearly different from images of the other bands .",
    "they show an elongated feature extended in the northwest - southeast direction which shows no correlation with the emission associated with the snr . also its peak position is located outside the boundary of the snr .",
    "these indicate that the n160- and wide - l - band emission is not directly associated with g292.0@xmath11.8 , although it is possible that the enhanced brightness in the sw part of oes is due to the interaction of the remnant with this extended structure ( cf .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fig_fis ] present the background - subtracted n60- and wide - s - band images .",
    "the background emission was estimated by calculating scaling factors between the n60- and n160-band images and also between the wide - s- and n160-band images from the areas outside the snr .",
    "compared to the n60- and wide - s - band images of the top panels , the background - subtracted images show more clearly the emission associated with the snr , including the northern part of the oes that is not clear in the orignial images .",
    "the er and oes are the most prominent features in our @xmath0 multi - band ir images ( figures  [ fig_irc ] and [ fig_fis ] ) .",
    "the er is composed of two filaments , where the southern one is brighter than the northern counterpart .",
    "the southern filament appears to be of the normal composition in soft x - rays @xcite without any apparent radial motion in the optical @xcite , which led the authors to conclude that it is csm from the progenitor of the sn in g292.0@xmath11.8 .",
    "we suggest that the northern filament , which has been clearly found by @xmath0 observations , could be part of the same structure based on its similar distribution to the southern filament .",
    "we note that the bright clump at ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) near the eastern end of the northern filament has a counterpart in the [ ] image of @xcite .",
    "its velocity is near zero , which supports that the northern and southern filaments form a single structure .",
    "furthermore , it is most clearly visible at the @xmath5120 km s@xmath9 frame of the rutgers fabry - perot velocity scan images and absent at the 0 km s@xmath9 frame where the southern filament is brightest ( figure 2 of ghavamina et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we interpret this velocity difference as an indication suggesting that the northern and southern filaments are parts of a tilted , expanding ring structure produced by the progenitor of the sn .",
    "the location of the center point of the oes at the middle of the two filaments also reconciles with the interpretation , given the csm - nature of the oes ( see below ) .",
    "we note that such a , but smaller , ring structure of the csm was found in sn 1987a and also possibly in the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "the oes , on the other hand , is relatively fainter in x - rays than the er @xcite . the @xmath0 mir brightness and color of the oes , however , are similar to those of the er ( figure  [ fig_cmap ] ) . toward the southern filament of the er , @xcite reported the detection of the optical radiative lines produced by the partially radiative shocks starting to develop cooling zones .",
    "it implies that the x - ray emitting gas in the er is cooler than that of the oes , while they have somewhat similar dust properties .",
    "and there is a possibility that the er in s11-s7 difference image also contains the [ ] line emission produced in the csm region where the shock has started to cool down to @xmath38 100,000 k. however , its contribution might be small , because we have not detected the [ ] 12.8 @xmath2 m line at the er .    in addition to the er and oes , there are faint mir emissions beyond the northern and southeastern edges of the oes ( figure  [ fig_cmap ] ) .",
    "they have sharp outer boundaries , representing the current locations of the sn blast wave .",
    "faint x - ray emission was detected in those areas too @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the sn blast wave has overtaken the oes and produced those emission features while propagating into a more diffuse medium . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the remnant has a front - back asymmetry and they are just projected boundaries of the more - extended shell . in any case , their asymmetric spatial distribution suggests that either the ambient density distribution or the mass ejection from progenitor was asymmetric .    as in figure",
    "[ fig_spec ] , the mir emission of g292.0@xmath11.8  is dominated by continuum emission , not by line emission .",
    "this implies that the ir emission is from shock - heated dust grains in the csm .",
    "figure  [ fig_sedtot ] presents the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the snr in table  [ tab_f ] .",
    "we applied modified blackbody fits composed of two dust components to the observed sed in order to obtain the best - fit dust temperatures .",

    "it can be seen that the results of the silicate grains with @xmath61 0.5 cm@xmath44 , which coincides with the density estimated from x - ray observations @xcite , can reasonably reproduce the overall shape of the ir sed for g292.0@xmath11.8 . in this case",

    "if the ir emission originates in the swept - up materials containing the mass - loss wind of rsg with the solar metallicity , the condensation of silicate is expected , and , according to our results , its condensation efficiency could be low .",

    "however , the sed at shorter wavelengths could be resolved by including the effect of a stochastic heating of small grains ; stochastically heated dust produces more emission at shorter wavelengths than the dust with equilibrium temperature , and it may also allow acceptable fits for lower initial density and/or different size distribution of dust than the current best fit . alternatively , this disagreement may be caused by the difference in the assumed composition of dust .",
    "to gain deeper insights into the properties of dust in g292.0@xmath11.8 , we need further investigations by taking account of the stochastic heating and changing the composition and size distribution of dust as well as the density profile in the ambient medium .",

    "recent measurement of their proper motions showed that they are expanding systematically from a point near the geometrical center of the oes ( * ? ? ? * see   4.4 too ) .    according to our spectroscopic result , the ir - ejecta shows  12.8 @xmath2 m emission but no [ ] 7.0 or [ ] 9.0 @xmath2 m emission .",
    "note that the latter lines from ar ions were also detected at the metal - rich ejecta in young snrs @xcite .",
    "the lack of ir line emission from ar ions in this area is consistent with the results of optical or x - ray studies which showed that there is no line emission from elements heavier than s in this area ( ghavamian et al .",

    "the absence of ar lines supports the claim by @xcite that we are not seeing the ejecta in the inner - most region accelerated by pulsar wind nebula but seeing the he - burning - synthesized , o - rich ejecta swept - up by reverse shock .",
    "the ir - ejecta shows high l15/l24 ratio , i.e. , l15/l24=0.88 compared to 0.25 of the shocked csm .",
    "the high l15/l24 ratio is at least partly due to ne lines .",

    "we may estimate the possible contribution of  15.6  line in g292.0 + 1.8 as follows .",

    "we have derived ir fluxes associated with the ejecta and the results are summarized in table  [ tab_f ] .",
    "it is difficult to extract the ejecta emission in ir observations , although our results unveiled the ejecta region unambiguously .",

    "fir emission is certainly dominated by dust continuum .",
    "the l24-band contains the [ ] 25.9 @xmath2 m line emission , whose wavelength is not covered with our spectroscopic observations .",
    "its contribution in l24-band is expected to be less than 20 % in our estimation using the [ ] 25.9 @xmath2 m line intensity in @xcite . at first",

    "this ir - emitting dust mass is much smaller ( @xmath38 4 @xmath10 10@xmath40 ) than the theoretically predicted dust mass ( 0.11 m@xmath98 ) to be formed in the core - collapse sn explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently the results from mir observations of g292.0@xmath11.8   with the @xmath6 satellite have been published @xcite based on low - resolution spectroscopy of the ejecta and the southern filament of the er where the ejecta emission is superimposed on the emission from the csm . the former is located @xmath3  0.5 north from our ir - ejecta slit position , while the latter , which has a high l15/l24 ratio , is @xmath3  1  apart in the northeast direction .",

    "the observd ratio , however , is 0.25 for the er and oes and 0.88 for the ejecta .",
    "therefore , the contribution of [ ] 25.9 @xmath2 m line flux to the observed l24-band flux should be small , particularly toward the er where @xmath99 (   3.2 ) .",
    "we , however , note that the @xmath6 irs spectrum toward the ejecta in @xcite does not show any obvious dust continuum emission between 24 and 36 @xmath2 m .",
    "we consider that it could be because there was dust continuum emission in the irs background . in the @xmath0 24 @xmath2 m image ,",
    "there is faint filament coincident with the irs background region ( ll1 sky in ghavamian et al .",
    "this filament is associated with the oes and its 24 @xmath2 m emission might be dominated by dust continuum , so that , by subtracting its spectrum from the ejecta spectrum , the continuum feature could have been removed .",
    "an interesting feature in the @xmath6 ejecta spectrum is a weak 1525 @xmath2 m bump , which was suggested to be produced by newly - formed dust or swept - up pahs along the line of sight .",
    "first of all , this bump explains the high l15/l24 ratio at the ejecta region described in ",
    "the peak of the bump feature appears in the l15 band .",
    "therefore , it contributes mainly to the @xmath0 15 @xmath2 m band .",
    "secondly , our @xmath0 observations show that the areas with a high l15/l24 ratio are coincident with those of the optical o - rich ejecta region .",
    "this supports the interpretation that the bump feature is related to the newly - formed dust in association with the sn ejecta , not to the swept - up pahs .    according to @xcite , the @xmath6 spectrum from the southern filament of the er is consistent with the emission from two dust components : a warm ( or hot ) component of @xmath100 114 k and a cold component of",
    "@xmath100 35 k. the temperature of the warm dust is higher than what we estimated with the @xmath0 data by @xmath3  10  k , while that of the cold dust is lower than the @xmath0 temperature by a comparable amount .",
    "it is possible that the presence of the bump feature in the @xmath6 spectrum resulted in a higher temperature for the warm dust . for the cold dust temperature ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , the absence of the longer wavelength ( @xmath20 30 @xmath2 m ) data in the @xmath6 spectrum is likely the primary reason of the lower temperature compared to the @xmath0 results .",
    "ir spectroscopic observations covering a broad band are necessary to clearly resolve the issues .",
    "one interesting result that we obtained in this study is the difference ( @xmath3 42  @xmath101 1 pc ) between the center of the csm and the dynamical center of the ejecta ( figure  [ fig_cmap ] ) .",
    "the former corresponds to the center of the er and oes that we determined with the @xmath0 results ; the latter was determined by the distribution of the o - rich ejecta in the optical , which is close to the center of the snr in the radio emission .",
    "in addition , the position of the pulsar is different from the both positions  it is shifted in the southeast direction from the dynamical center by @xmath3 46 .",
    "one possibility is that the progenitor star was at the center of oes during its rsg phase but exploded at the position of the dynamical center of optical knots .",
    "this is possible because the rsg wind could be confined by external pressure while the central star is moving .",
    "according to @xcite , the rsg wind from a 2535 m@xmath41 star , which explodes as sn iil / b , would be pressure confined while its outer radius becomes @xmath102 pc .",
    "the radius of oes ( 6 pc ) is comparable to what the theory predicts .",
    "if the progenitor star was moving at @xmath3 10 km s@xmath9 and exploded after @xmath3 10@xmath103 yrs of the pressure confinement of the shell , then the explosion center would be close to the dynamical center of optical knots .",
    "another possibility is that the sn exploded at the center of er and oes , not at the dynamical center of the ejecta or the center of the radio emission .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the oes shows a very well - defined shell structure surrounding the snr , thereby the center of the oes may pinpoint to the real location of the progenitor , which later exploded as a sn . on the other hand ,",
    "the centers of the radio emission and the o - rich ejecta motion could have been weighted toward the southeast : firstly , the geometrical center of the radio nebula could be significantly weighted toward the southeast because of the existence of the bright pwn . secondly",
    ", the dynamical center of optical knots is also weighted to the southeast because the bright optical knots in the southeastern area are moving relatively slowly and the center is derived using an assumption of an unhindered constant velocity since the explosion @xcite .",
    "if the sn explosion in g292.0@xmath11.8  indeed occurred at the center of the oes , then the tangential velocity of the pulsar needs to be @xmath3 1,000 km s@xmath9 .",
    "although 1,000  is somewhat large as a pulsar kick velocity , it is still within the acceptable range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the pulsar in another o - rich snr puppis  a may also have such a high velocity @xcite .      the optical and x - ray studies of the sn ejecta in g292.0@xmath11.8 have shown that their spatial distribution and physical properties are not symmetric , including the northwest - southeast concentration of the o and ne ejecta , and the distinctive difference of the x - ray plasma temperature between the northwestern and southeastern areas @xcite .",
    "also the ejecta in the northern and southern boundaries move faster than those in the eastern and western areas @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the pulsar jet axis is also along the northeast - southwest direction @xcite .",
    "our @xmath0 result on the ne - line emitting ejecta material identified by their high l15/l24 ratio is consistent with the spatial distribution seen in [ ] 5007 : most of the @xmath104/@xmath105 ions are distributed in the southeastern area called spur and streamers , several isolated ones coincide with the optical knots , and the other group of ne - rich knots is distributed in the northwestern area and coincides with [ ] optical emission knots ( fast - moving knots , or fmks , as reported by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the northwest ejecta is less obvious in optical but it is easily recognized in the x - ray image of ionized o and ne elements @xcite .",
    "this type of bipolar ejecta distribution is also found in other young core - collapse snrs , e.g. , cas a and g11.2@xmath50.3 @xcite .",
    "cas a shows a similar ne ejecta distribution , which is almost perpendicular to the well - known narrow northeast - southwest jet , but is roughly aligned to the bipolar ionic ejecta , which sometimes is suggested be the major direction of explosion @xcite . in g11.2@xmath50.3 , which is the remnant of the historical sn ad 386 , the iron ejecta",
    "is found to be distributed mainly along northwest - southeast direction @xcite .    the symmetry axis in the spatial and kinematical distribution of ejecta in g292.0@xmath11.8 ,",
    "therefore , is either along northwest - southeast or north - south , which is perpendicular to the plane of the er . we consider that either the explosion was asymmetric and/or the cs wind was denser in the equatorial plane so that the ejecta expanding in this plane was slowed down more compared to those expanding to the other directions .",
    "an interesting feature is the narrow tail in the wide l18w - band image that extends from the end of the streamers to outside the remnant .",
    "a possible explanation is that the narrow tail is a part of the o - rich streamer .",
    "note that the narrow tail is connected to the streamers by a southern patch of emission near the boundary of l15-band image .",
    "the distance from the center to the end of the narrow tail is 7@xmath4 ( 13 pc ) , which is @xmath3 2@xmath4 ( 3 pc ) farther than the outermost o - rich clump in this area @xcite .",
    "it , however , does not has an optical counterpart in the [ ] image @xcite . if we assume a constant velocity and adopt an age of 3,000 yrs @xcite , the transverse velocity of the narrow tail is 4,000 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this gives a possibility that its radial velocity is also very large , beyond the velocity range of previous optical narrow - band imaging observations ( e.g. , @xmath3 2,000 km s@xmath9 in * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative explanation is that the narrow tail is a reradiated ir light echo similar to the echoes identified in cas  a @xcite .",
    "the lack of counterpart in the optical [ ] and x - ray images , together with the faint feature in the fir images ( figure  [ fig_fis ] ) , could be consistent with the continuum origin of the ir emission . in case of a light echo",
    ", the location of the echo can be derived from the geometrical equation of ellipse whose two focuses are the sn and the observer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "applying a projected radius of 13 pc and a time delay of 3,000 yrs , we obtain a location of the ir echo at 450 pc behind g292.0@xmath11.8 and its angular offset of @xmath3 2@xmath106 from the line of sight .",
    "it appears that this alignment is too tight at a first glance , but it can be a selection effect caused by our limited imaging area .",
    "for example , @xcite discovered ir echoes along the scan direction in cas  a for the first time , but @xcite reported that the echoes were distributed in many positions in large ( @xmath3 2@xmath106 ) area .",
    "more observations are definitely necessary to inspect the nature of the narrow tail .    on the other hand , the sharp boundary of the sn blast wave was detected only toward the north and southwest ( figure  [ fig_cmap ] ) .",
    "the absence of sn blast wave in the other directions implies that either the shock is trapped within the shell because that part of the shell has a larger column density or the sn blast wave has propagated far beyond because the ambient density is lower toward that direction . there is no indication in the @xmath0 images that the oes is denser , where the sn blast wave is missing . instead those parts are fainter in the fir images which indicates a lower column density . in this regard ,",
    "the faint mir emission that extends far beyond the bright shell to the southeast ( figure  [ fig_ircw ] ) is interesting because if it is part of the snr , it indicates that the sn blast wave has propagated much further out toward this direction probably due to the lower ambient density .",
    "a deep radio observation could reveal faint features associated with this ir structure .",
    "we have presented the nir to fir imaging and mir spectroscopic observations of the o - rich snr g292.0@xmath11.8 using the irc and fis instruments aboard @xmath0 satellite .",
    "the almost continuous multiband imaging capability of @xmath0 covering wide ir wavelengths together its wide field of view enabled us to clearly see the distinct ir emission from the entire snr and to derive its ir charactersitics .",
    "we derive the physical parameters of ir - emitting dust grains in the swept - up circumstellar medium and compare the result with the model calculations of dust destruction by a sn shock .",

    "<S> we present the results of @xmath0 observations of the o - rich supernova remnant g292.0@xmath11.8 using six irc and four fis bands covering 2.726.5 @xmath2 m and 50180 @xmath2 m , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 images show two prominent structures ; a bright equatorial ring structure along the east - west direction and an outer elliptical shell structure surrounding the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> the equatorial ring structure is clumpy and incomplete with its western end opened . </S>",
    "<S> the outer shell is almost complete and slightly squeezed along the north - south direction . </S>",
    "<S> the central position of the outer shell is @xmath3 1@xmath4 northwest from the embedded pulsar and coincides with the center of the equatorial ring structure . in the northen and southwestern regions </S>",
    "<S> , there is also faint emission with a sharp boundary beyond the bright shell structure . the equatorial ring and the elliptical shell structures were partly visible in optical and/or x - rays , but they are much more clearly revealed in our @xmath0 images . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evident difference in infrared colors of the two prominent structures , which is consistent with the previous proposition that both structures are of circumstellar origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have detected faint infrared emission of a considerably high 15 to 24 @xmath2 m ratio associated with the supernova ejecta in the southeastern and northwestern areas . </S>",
    "<S> our irc spectra show that the high ratio is at least partly due to the emission lines from ne ions in the supernova ejecta material . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we detect a narrow , elongated feature outside the snr shell . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the physical parameters of the infrared - emitting dust grains in the shocked circumstellar medium and compare the result with model calculations of dust destruction by a sn shock . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 results suggest that the progenitor was at the center of the infrared circumstellar shell in red supergiant stage and that the observed asymmetry in the sn ejecta could be a result of either a dense circumstellar medium in the equatorial plane and/or an asymmetric explosion . </S>"
