( [ eq : transvalence ] ) ] , except for the opposite sign for the mirror transformation , @xmath41 , and , hence , belongs to @xmath42 representation .    finally , the conduction electron and the valence hole form ortho- and para - excitons with the total spin , @xmath43 , respectively , 1 and 0 . due to the exchange interaction between the conduction and valence electrons in the @xmath4 yellow exciton state ,",
    "the energy of the ortho - exciton is @xmath44mev higher than that of para - exciton @xcite .",
    "since the valence @xmath45 and conduction @xmath39 bands have the same parity , the excitation of the yellow exciton series is dipole forbidden and results from the electric quadrupole transition @xcite .",

    "in this way we can obtain the following unusual selection rules for orthoexcitons from the yellow series : a photon with the polarization @xmath81 [ @xmath82 excites either the state with @xmath83 and @xmath73 , or the state with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these selection rules are opposite to those for rotationally - invariant systems , where the @xmath75-component of the total angular momentum is a good quantum number .",

    "magnetic field has a strong effect on the relative motion of the electron and hole , especially , in highly - excited excitonic states .",
    "the problem of finding energies of excitonic states in magnetic field is simplified by the conservation of the total momentum of the electron - hole pair @xcite , which makes it equivalent to the problem of hydrogen atom in magnetic field @xcite , .",

    "we choose the cylindrical coordinates with the @xmath75 axis along the magnetic field , and @xmath109 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hydrogen ] ) is invariant under rotations around the direction of magnetic field , therefore @xmath110 is a good quantum number . as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : selection ] , only the exciton states with @xmath111 are excited in the photoabsorption experiment .    the dependence of eigenfunctions on @xmath75 and @xmath112 was found numerically by solving eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian written in the basis of functions , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the magnetic length @xmath115 multiplied by @xmath116 , while @xmath117 and @xmath118 are , respectively , the hermite and laguerre polynomials . in this basis the matrix elements of the coulomb interaction can be evaluated analytically , which simplifies the calculation of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hydrogen ] ) .",
    "this method is appropriate in the strong - field limit , where the distance between the landau levels , @xmath119 , is larger than the exciton rydberg constant , @xmath120 .",
    "however , using a rather large basis with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we can extend its applicability up to the physically interesting fields of @xmath123 t . in the opposite limit of weak fields we diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hydrogen ] ) in the basis of the zero - field hydrogen wave functions of the discrete spectrum and truncate the basis at @xmath124 . in both cases we checked that the energies of the levels do not change upon a further increase of the basis dimension .",
    "the @xmath125-dependence of the exciton energies obtained in the two opposite limits matches in the region of intermediate magnetic fields , which allows us to calculate the exciton energies for arbitrary magnetic fields .",
