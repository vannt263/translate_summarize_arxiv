    "one of the unique features of superfluid helium at low temperature is that elementary excitations like rotons and high energy phonons have a very long mean free path , long enough to propagate ballistically in the liquid on macroscopic distances .",
    "furthermore their energy is comparable with the energy required to eject atoms from liquid to vacuum .",
    "thus rotons and phonons impinging on the free surface of the liquid can evaporate atoms by one - to - one quantum processes .",
    "one can also produce collimated beams of elementary excitations and collect the evaporated atoms above the surface in order to extract information on the properties of the superfluid .",
    "similarly one can investigate the opposite process of atoms which condense in the liquid by producing elementary excitations .",
    "several experiments have been carried out in the last decades@xcite to explore the phenomenon of quantum evaporation and condensation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . from the theoretical viewpoint@xcite these processes",
    "are very appealing , being clean examples of scattering of excitations in a highly correlated many - body quantum system .",
    "a good theory of quantum evaporation and condensation is however a difficult task and a clear understanding of the fundamental mechanism underlying these phenomena has still to come , even though relevant steps in this direction have been accomplished in the last years .    in this paper",
    "we present a time dependent mean field theory , based on the density functional formalism , which allows one to calculate the scattering matrix elements associated with the scattering of rotons , phonons and atoms at the free surface .",
    "preliminary results of this theory have been recently published in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we discuss the theory in more detail and we present results in a wider range of energy and wave vectors .",
    "a discussion about quantum evaporation and condensation requires first a detailed knowledge of the spectrum of elementary excitations of superfluid @xmath0he . a schematic picture is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the liquid - vacuum interface is supposed to be in the @xmath6-plane .",
    "the system is translational invariant in those directions , so that the parallel wave vector @xmath7 is a conserved quantity ( we choose @xmath8 without any loss of generality ) .",
    "the minimum energy needed to produce free atom states outside the liquid at zero temperature is the chemical potential @xmath9 k. the threshold for evaporation for given values of @xmath7 is then @xmath10 ( dashed line ) .",
    "phonons , rotons and atoms can propagate at different angles with respect to the surface , that is with different @xmath11 for a given @xmath7 .",
    "the dispersion law for phonons and rotons propagating in the bulk liquid and in the direction parallel to the surface ( @xmath12 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "excitations having @xmath13 fill different regions of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] with a continuum of states .",
    "for instance each point in region v corresponds to a roton @xmath1 ( positive group velocity ) propagating with @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is the @xmath1 roton dispersion . since @xmath16 , roton states with @xmath13 fill the region at the left of the roton branch plotted in the figure . similarly in region",
    "iv also @xmath3 rotons ( negative group velocity ) can propagate ; each point in that region can be a combination of @xmath1 and @xmath3 rotons propagating at different angles . above the threshold for evaporation , in region iii , atom states outside the liquid are possible too .",
    "similarly in region ii one has phonons , rotons as well as atoms ; in region i , below the energy of the roton minimum , @xmath4 , there are only phonons and atoms ; finally in region vi , above the maxon energy , there are rotons and atoms .",
    "the free surface acts as a scattering region for all these excitations .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the effect of the surface on the propagation of the elementary excitations has been studied within a local density approximation .",
    "the dispersion law of the excitations was assumed to be the same as for a uniform liquid of density equal to the local density .",
    "maris@xcite used a simple interpolation between the phonon - roton dispersion law in bulk liquid and the dispersion law of the free atoms .",
    "he studied the behavior of classical trajectories for quasiparticles along the @xmath17-direction assuming the conservation of energy and parallel momentum . from that analysis one finds some interesting constraints on the structure of the classical trajectories crossing the free surface .",
    "for instance only phonons and rotons above the maxon energy ( about @xmath18 k ) are found to evaporate atoms .",
    "vice - versa , the theory predicts no evaporation from rotons with energy smaller than the maxon energy , because of the occurrence of a barrier at the interface .",
    "the experimental evidence @xcite for quantum evaporation induced by rotons even below the maxon energy is consequently an important indication of the crucial role played by quantum effects .",
    "quantum effects were partially included in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite by means of perturbation theory based on wkb states ; the density profile in that case was approximated by a suitable analytic function and the dispersion law for the excited states , in local density approximation , was calculated using beliaev s theory with an effective interaction .",
    "for an accurate treatment of quantum effects one has to go beyond the local density approximation and the semiclassical treatment . to accomplish the task we proceed in two distinct steps :    *",
    "we first evaluate the ground state and the excited states of the inhomogeneous system within a self - consistent theory sufficiently accurate to reproduce the main features of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , including the structure and the excitations of the free surface . *",
    "we identify the current carried by the elementary excitations and use the numerical solutions of the equations of motion to calculate the asymptotic flux of excitations associated with a given scattering process .",
    "while this identification is trivial in the description of free atoms in vacuum , it becomes less obvious in the liquid where many - body effects , present in this highly correlated system , must be properly included .",
    "taking the ratios of incoming and outgoing fluxes one finally gets the evaporation and condensation probabilities , which are the final goal of the theory .    for the first step we use a time dependent mean field theory based on the least action principle applied to an energy functional @xmath19",
    "$ ] . for the form of the functional",
    "we follow the recent proposal of ref .",
    "we consider linear variation of @xmath20 , in the form @xmath21 , and expand @xmath22 in plane waves along the parallel direction .",
    "we restrict ourselves to variations of the energy linear in @xmath22 .",
    "for this reason the theory describes only one - to - one processes ( evaporation of one atom by one roton , creation of one roton by condensing one atom , etc . ) and not processes involving more than two excitations ( for example multi - phonon or multi - ripplon production in the atom condensation process ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some experiments by wyatt and co - workers@xcite support the idea that the evaporation of atoms from bulk excitations is essentially a one - to - one process , so that the use of a linear theory seems justified in this case .",
    "conversely measurements of atom condensation @xcite point out an important role played by non linear effects associated with the creation of ripplons .",
    "this asymmetry between evaporation and condensation is still basically unexplained .",
    "quantitative predictions for the scattering rates in linear theory are essential in order to better understand the origin of this and other discrepancies .    as concerns the second step we derive the definition of flux ( or current density ) associated with the propagation of the elementary excitations , in terms of the linearised solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "we show that such a current density obeys the proper equation of continuity",
    ". we will devote detailed discussions about the meaning of the flux of excitations and about the properties of the scattering matrix elements , which are calculated starting from the knowledge of the fluxes involved in the scattering process .",
    "the theory can be applied to all the relevant regions of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . in the present work we present results for processes involving rotons and atoms in the region iii .",
    "we chose this region for two basic reasons : first , phonons are not allowed there and thus the analysis is simpler ; second , the arguments based on classical trajectories predict no evaporation in this region and this means that quantum effects should play a crucial role in the evaporation process",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath47 then takes the form @xmath48 and the equation of motion becomes @xmath49 the term @xmath50 is linear in @xmath22 and accounts for changes in the hamiltonian induced by the collective motion of the system .",
    "since @xmath47 depends explicitly on the wave function @xmath20 , equation ( [ eq : schro ] ) has to be solved using a self - consistent procedure .",
    "the above scheme corresponds to a time dependent density functional ( tddf ) theory .",
    "a discussion about equivalent formulations of the same approach ( hydrodynamic - like equations , green s functions ) , as well as about the connection with other many body approaches , is given in refs .",
    "equations of the same type are obtained using correlated basis functions in the context of hypernetted chain approximation @xcite . here",
    "we stress that the theory corresponds to a quantum mechanical treatment of the dynamics and consequently accounts for the interference and tunneling phenomena which are expected to play a crucial role in the evaporation process . of course , due to linearisation , they do not include inelastic processes associated with multi - phonons or multi - ripplons .",
    "as already said in the introduction , these effects lie beyond the present theory .    to proceed further one has to specify both the explicit form of the energy functional ( [ eq : e ] ) and the geometry of the system under investigation .",
    "the energy functional is the one introduced in ref  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two parts , a functional of the particle density only and a functional of both the particle density and the current density .",

    "et al._@xcite .",
    "its explicit form is given in appendix a. the functional is phenomenological , i.e. , it contains parameters which are fixed to reproduce known properties of the bulk liquid .",
    "in particular the equation of state and the static response function in bulk liquid are reproduced by construction .",
    "the new functional , with respect to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , contains a current - current effective interaction , which accounts for backflow - like correlations and allows one to reproduce the experimental phonon - roton spectrum in the uniform liquid .",

    "the profile of the free surface obtained with the present density functional theory is about @xmath53    thick and compares well with the one coming from ab initio calculations as well as with the experimental data of ref .",

    "the hartree equation ( [ eq : hartree ] ) for the ground state is solved by diffusing a trial wave function in imaginary time .",
    "after several iterations the procedure converges to the density profile which minimise the energy functional .",

    "as soon as phonons are allowed ( region i and ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) they are expected to provide the natural channel for the condensation of the incoming atoms .",

    "this mechanism is not accounted for in our one - to - one theory .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the evaporation and condensation processes taking place at the free surface of superfluid helium .",
    "the main achievements of the present work concern both the formal development of scattering theory , in the framework of linearised time dependent density functional formalism , and the numerical analysis , which provides first systematic results for the evaporation , condensation and reflection rates . the most relevant steps and achievements of our approach are here summarised :    * \\i ) the equations of motion of linearised time dependent density functional theory have been explicitly solved in the presence of the free surface using the orsay - trento phenomenological density functional . by taking linear combinations of different solutions carrying the same energy and momentum parallel to the surface , we have selected the relevant scattering processes ( incoming atom reflected into an atom or condensed into a @xmath1 or @xmath3 roton , etc . ) . *",
    "\\ii ) we have identified , in the framework of the time dependent density functional scheme , the current of elementary excitations which obeys the equation of continuity ( [ eq : continuity ] ) and allows one to evaluate the rates of evaporation and reflection .",
    "this current is determined by the group velocity and by the density of elementary excitations for which the familiar rpa expression ( [ eq : rhoj ] ) holds .",
    "the resulting formalism has been shown to be consistent with the general properties of the scattering matrix , following from unitarity and time reversal invariance . *",
    "\\iii ) the numerical results , restricted in the present work to the region where only condensation of atoms into rotons is possible ( region iii of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) , reveal that rotons @xmath1 are systematically more effective than rotons @xmath3 in the evaporation mechanism .",
    "an interesting feature emerging from our analysis , is that the @xmath128 scattering probability is extremely small at all energies .",
    "this behavior , with the help of the formal properties of the scattering matrix , allows one to express all the evaporation and reflection rates in terms of a single parameter [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : special1]-[eq : special4 ] ) ] . *",
    "\\iv ) a major discrepancy between our predictions and the experimental data concerns the atomic reflectivity which is predicted to be significantly large when the energy approaches the roton minimum .",
    "this behavior is easily understood since our theory accounts only for one - to - one processes where condensation into ripplons is excluded by the conservation laws .",
    "due to the absence of phonon excitations , which are excluded in region iii , no active excitations are allowed in the condensation process when the energy approaches the roton minimum with the consequent full reflection of the incident atom .",
    "natural developments of the present work will include :    * the study of the scattering process in different ranges of energy and incident angles , where phonons can participate in the scattering process . * the study of multi - ripplon excitations whose effects can be taken into account through the use of an optical - type potential in the time dependent equations .",
