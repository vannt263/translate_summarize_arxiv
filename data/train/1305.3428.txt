    "over the past decade there has been increasing interest in the development of bi - doped fiber lasers ( bfl ) and amplifiers ( bfa ) .",
    "notwithstanding the significant progress achieved in recent years @xcite , such devices suffer from a number of drawbacks .",
    "the very low levels of bismuth doping and , as a consequence , significant fiber length ( typically 80 - 100 m ) are necessary to ensure the efficient bfl and bfa operation .",
    "it is generally believed that the poor understanding of the nature of the pl in bi - doped glasses is the main reason restraining the development of the efficient devices .",
    "indeed , since the first demonstration of the nir pl in bi - doped silica glasses @xcite and up to now there is no consensus on the nature of the pl in bi - doped glasses ( see , for instance the reviews on the subject @xcite and references therein ) . in this context",
    "the search and investigation of the new glass compositions provide a significant insight into the understanding of the nature of luminescent centers in bi - doped silica glasses .",
    "this is even more important than the attempts of the empirical optimization of the bfl and bfa efficiency without the deep understanding of the pl nature in bi - doped glasses .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the luminescent properties of ga / bi co - doped silica in a wide temperature range .",
    "we show that the pl centers in this material are the analogues of those in al / bi co - doped silica glass .",
    "we also put in evidence that when excited in the visible , the nir pl centers emitting in the range of 1000 - 1200 nm are mainly populated via the efficient et from the excited states of the centers absorbing and emitting in the visible part of the complex pl spectrum .",
    "while the latter centers can be identified as bi@xmath0 ions , the nir pl , most probably , should be assigned to the defects , as it was suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "based on our experiments , we propose a consistent energy level diagram , which explains the experimental results in a weakly doped with bismuth and ga(al ) silica glasses .",
    "we would like to emphasize , that the present work gives an overview of many experiments that can not be described in detail in a single article .",
    "the detailed description and analysis of the temperature dependence of the decay kinetics at 737 nm , temperature dependence of the anti - stokes pl and the detailed investigation of the zero - phonon line observed at low temperature remain out of the scope of the present article and will be published elsewhere .",
    "the novel bulk ga / bi co - doped pure silica glass was produced from nano - porous silica xerogel doped with a synthesized heterotrinuclear molecular precursor , namely , [ bi@xmath1(hsal)@xmath6ga(acac)@xmath7 , where hsal = o@xmath1cc@xmath6h@xmath2 - 2-oh and hacac = ch@xmath8coch@xmath1coch@xmath8 .",
    "the step of the high temperature drawing was omitted in the present experiments and the samples with the dimensions of 2x3x5mm@xmath9 were cut , polished and analyzed after the step of the sintering at 1300@xmath10 .",
    "the content of bismuth and gallium was measured as 35ppm and 138ppm , respectively .",
    "the details of the fabrication technology and the content measuring procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the details of our experimental pl set - up were reported in @xcite .",
    "the present experiments were performed with the closed cycle helium cryostat ( spectromagpt , oxford instr . ) operating in a wide temperature range of 1.4 - 300k .",
    "the thermal stability of the samples attached to the holder of the variable temperature insert was about of 0.01k except the range from 4.2 to 10k where the thermal stability was @xmath110.05k . in cw pl experiments",
    "the following laser sources were employed : verdi ( 6 w , 532 nm , coherent inc . ) , tunable cw ti : sapphire ( 685 - 1000 nm , model 899 , coherent inc . ) and tunable yb - doped fiber laser ( custom laser , 1060 - 1100 nm , up to 10w , manlight , france ) .",
    "the additional pulsed laser source was the optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) opolette 355 ld ( 8ns , opotek inc . ) .",
    "in the experiments the pulse energy from the opo was maintained constant , about of 100 @xmath12j per pulse . in the visible range of the spectrum the pl",
    "decay kinetics were measured with the high speed photomultiplier with the transit time spread ( tts ) as low as 120ps and free from the afterpulsing ( pmc-100 - 20 , becker & hickl gmbh ) . the anti - stokes spectra were acquired with the help of the cell ftir600 ( linkam scientific instr . ) with the temperature stability better than 0.1k .",
    "the spectral and time resolution were variable from 0.7 to 3 nm and from 1ns to 1.024@xmath12s , respectively , depending on the spectral range and the operation mode ( cw or tr ) .",

    "nm reveals the band at 615 nm , which was always assigned to bi@xmath14 ions @xcite , the complex band with the maximum at 756 nm and the very intense nir band with the maximum at 1140 nm and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) about of 160 nm ( hereafter this band will be referenced as p0 band ) .",
    "the excitation at 660 nm reveals only two pl bands at 787 and 1090 nm , the latter with fwhm about of 185 nm .",
    "note the considerable blue shift ( 50 nm ) and the increase of the width of p0 band comparing to that under excitation at 532 nm . in fig.1(b ) we show in a logarithmic scale as is \" spectra under excitation at 532 nm but recorded at two temperatures , 300 and 1.46k and the spectra under excitation at 660 and 800 nm ( 1.46k ) .",
    "first , the excitation at 800 nm reveals the weakly pronounced maximum at 1400 nm due to the centers in a silica sub - lattice @xcite .",
    "this difference in comparison to the recently reported by us results on the pl in al / bi co - doped silica glass @xcite , where only al - conected centers were observed , can be attributed to the difference in the al / bi and ga / bi doping ratio , 80 and 4 , respectively .",
    "most probably , the low chemical reactivity of ga with the host silica , in comparison to al , leads to its enhanced volatility and , as a consequence , to its lower content in the sintered glass .",
    "the latter results in the increased probability of the formation of the nir centers in a silica sub - lattice . nevertheless , the content of the bismuth related centers in a silica sub - lattice remains extremely low and they are not considered in the present paper .",
    "second , the band p0 is absent under excitation at 800 nm .",
    "third , it is clearly seen that the band at 615 nm completely disappears at low temperature under excitation at 532 nm , while the complex band around of 740 nm reveals its triplet structure .",
    "the triplet structure of this band was pointed out previously in @xcite , where bi - doped germano - alumino - phospho - silicate fiber preform was investigated at low temperature .",

    "fig.2(a ) shows the pl spectra recorded at 1.46k at different excitation wavelengths .",
    "though we do not provide the detailed deconvolution , it is seen from fig.2(a ) that both red bands , peaked at 615 and 670 nm , are present in the spectrum when the sample is excited at 480 nm . under excitation at 532 nm the band at 615 nm is absent , as it was mentioned above .",
    "fig.2(b ) shows the temperature dependence of the spectrum under excitation at 532 nm . at 300k",
    "the band at 615 nm is dominant in the cw spectrum .",
    "the decrease of the temperature results in the decrease of its relative intensity so that below 70k this band completely disappears . the same behavior was observed in the temperature dependent time resolved spectra ( see the next sub - section ) .",

    "spectral resolution 0.8nm.,width=453 ]    in fig.3(a ) and 3(b ) we show the gaussian deconvolution of the spectrum recorded at 1.46k under excitation at 532 and 660 nm , respectively . in this decomposition the dummy bands ( not shown in the graphs ) were introduced to model the short - wavelength shoulder of the main nir pl band ( for 532 nm excitation ) and the diffuse scattering from the pump ( for 660 nm excitation ) . for the sake of completeness",
    "all the peak parameters are collected in table1 .",
    "one can see that there are _ four _ bands in the pl spectrum in the range of 550 - 900 nm under excitation at 532 nm at 1.46k , while the excitation at 660 nm , results in only _ two _ pl bands and not in three as it could be expected .",
    "because the position and intensity of all pl bands depend strongly on the excitation wavelength , this cw experiment does not address exactly the question which pl band disappears in the spectrum under excitation at 660 nm in comparison to the spectrum excited at 532 nm ? \" , though , most probably , it should be the pl band p3 .",

    "we would like to point out the following features : ( i ) the intensity of the pl bands p1-p3 in the anti - stokes spectrum increases with lowering the temperature and ( ii ) the temperature independent intensity of the band p4 . such a behavior was observed down to 1.46k and it correlates well with the temperature dependence of the lifetimes of the bands p3 and p4 that are discussed in the next subsection .",

    "it consists of two interacting centers : bi@xmath17 ion and the defect , most probably associated to bismuth doping . on the left hand side",
    "we provide a scheme of the energy level splitting corresponding to bi@xmath17 ion . here",
    "the energy positions correspond to the pl bands observed in the experiment .",
    "this diagram is very similar to the results of analysis of intra - configuration optical transitions in pb@xmath4(2 ) center in srf@xmath1 @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "it is considered in the frame of the crystal field ( cf ) approximation , but it takes account of two important phenomena : ( i ) the jahn - teller or pseudo jahn - teller effects ( jte and pjte , respectively ) @xcite and ( ii ) the et between bi@xmath17 ion and defects ( et@xmath18 ) . in fig.12 for the sake of simplicity only two channels for the et were shown , but it should be remembered that all excited states of bi@xmath17 ion are the subject of this et .",
    "the relative efficiency of the et from the particular level can change the spectral shape of p0 band and its peak position , as it can be seen in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the apes s corresponding to the energy levels at 737 and 1087 nm ( emission wl s ) of bi@xmath17 ion are shown in fig.12 without the offset to simplify the diagram .",
    "note also that the definition of bi@xmath17 ion as a _ donor _",
    "is relative to the excitation wavelength , _",
    "i.e. _ when the system of such a donor - acceptor pair is excited in the range of 1070 - 1100 nm the reverse transfer from defects to bi@xmath17 ions can take place resulting , for instance , in the low efficiency of the fiber laser at room temperature .",
    "the apes s drawn in the middle and right - most parts should be regarded as a simple sketch , their exact parameters are unknown , here only the excitation and emission wl s are in the scale .     - energy transfer between bi@xmath0 ions ( donors ) , and defects ( acceptors ) ; jte and pjte are the jahn - teller and pseudo jahn - teller effects , respectively .",
    ", width=377 ]    this simple cf approach can be justified in the studied case by the interstitial character of the embedding of bi - ions in the silica glass network as it was discussed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the latter is also supported by our technology process , which consists in the low temperature sintering of the doped nano - porous silica xerogels . in the cf approximation",
    "the bi - ion can be regarded as an ion which does not form chemical bonds with the environment .",
    "this picture is not in contradiction with the model developed by e. kustov et al .",
    "@xcite , where the chemical bonding of _ s _ , _ p _ , and _",
    "d _ electrons of bismuth is taken into account explicitly in the frame of the semi - empirical theory of molecular orbitals , but it can be considered as a rather simplified approach . also , the low valence state of bi - ions was suggested in @xcite on the basis of the phenomenological theory of the optical basicity @xcite , while the defects as a possible origin of nir pl in glasses doped with different 6__p _ _ ( bi , pb ) and 5__p _ _ ( sn , sb ) ions were suggested previously by sharonov _ _ et al.__@xcite .    in the frame of the cf approach one can find the similarity between the energy level diagrams in all types of the silica glass with a low content of bismuth .",
    "indeed , the general similarity was pointed out recently in @xcite and we can add here that the position of pl bands and their relative intensity in al / bi co - doped silica glass are very close to that described in the present work .",
    "furthermore , the group of bands at 730 - 800 nm in al / bi @xcite and ga / bi co - doped glasses can be put in the correspondence to the bands at 830 , 845 and 906 nm ( see fig.2 and fig.3 in @xcite ) in a silica sub - lattice .",
    "we assign this group of pl bands to the @xmath19p@xmath20 multiplet of bi@xmath17 ion split by the cf as it is shown in fig.12 .",
    "note , that in the assumption of the axial local symmetry ( c@xmath21 , for instance ) the cf results in the doublet , @xmath19p@xmath20(e ) and singlet , @xmath19p@xmath20(a@xmath22 ) .",
    "then the e state should be the subject of the more or less strong jte @xcite , resulting in a double well structure of apes . obviously ,",
    "in disordered hosts the local symmetry of bi@xmath17 ion can be lower than axial , but in this case there remains the possibility of the pjte .",
    "this is also valid for all upper lying e states derived from the @xmath19p@xmath22 multiplet .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spectrum shown in fig.2(b ) suggests just this possibility .",
    "the corresponding assignment of bands should be clear from fig.12 .",
    "the analysis of the decay kinetics of the band p3 suggests its very long intrinsic lifetime , the longest among all measured in our experiments .",
    "the transition @xmath23 is rigorously forbidden as it was discussed in details by bartram _ _ et al.__@xcite , and for this reason its decay kinetics clearly indicates the et@xmath18 to the defects .",
    "note also , that the measured characteristic lifetimes of p0 band under excitation at 1064 nm are significantly shorter than that obtained under excitation at 532 and 710 nm ( see table2 ) .",
    "this justifies the assignment of the lowest excited state of bi@xmath17 ion to a@xmath20 state derived from @xmath19p@xmath22 multiplet .",
    "the transition @xmath24 is allowed , but most probably has a weak oscillator strength .",
    "the proposed eld explains many other experiments , in particular , the low laser efficiency in alumino - silicate fibers at room temperature , the strong temperature dependence of the laser efficiency and the unsaturable losses @xcite . in the frame of the proposed model all these experimental results are the direct consequence of the et@xmath18 from defects to bi@xmath17 ion .",
    "this should be clear from fig.6 .",
    "furthermore , the experiments on optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) , albeit incorrectly interpreted in @xcite , were performed just in this spectral range and also support the assumption on the defects .",
    "unfortunately , in the latter work the heavy doped samples were investigated and we can not exclude the contribution of clusters of bismuth in the signal of odmr .    finally , we would like to emphasize that , strictly speaking , the proposed here eld is valid for the glasses with a low content of bismuth , in other words for the lasing \" glasses .",
    "the enhanced concentration of bismuth results in the formation of dimers and other nano - clusters of bismuth .",
    "these clusters obviously have their own electronic structure and will contribute to the spectrum of the absorption and pl that in turn leads to the quenching of the fiber laser efficiency , most probably also due to et .",
    "considering the pure silica glass doped with the bismuth only , two scenarios are possible to explain the high efficiency of the fiber lasers operating in the range of 1400 - 1450 nm ( centers in a pure silica sub - lattice ) : 1 ) there are no defects associated to bismuth doping , then the fiber laser operates on the lowest transition of bi@xmath17 ion ; 2 ) there is a large energy mismatch between corresponding absorption spectra of the defects and bi@xmath17 ion , so that the et is inefficient .",
    "this point is not clarified up to now .",
    "it should be also noted , that when the present work was completed , two articles on the pl in bi - doped tlcl and csi single crystals appeared @xcite .",
    "though the studied hosts are rather different from the silica glass , the conclusions of the authors are similar to that in the present paper .",
    "here we did not discuss the nature of the defect , which was considered in @xcite as a complex of bi@xmath0 in tl site and a negatively charged cl vacancy in the nearest anion site .",
    "the energy transfer between bi@xmath0 ion and the defect , which was revealed in the present study suggests a different nature of the latter , at least in a silica glass .",
    "furthermore , the conclusions in @xcite were based on the quantum chemistry calculations and they need to be verified experimentally , especially the point on the nature of the defect .",
    "in conclusion , ga / bi co - doped silica glass was developed and investigated by continuous wave and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in a wide temperature range of 1.5 - 300k .",
    "the optical centers in this glass were identified as the analogues of the al - connected centers in al / bi co - doped silica glass .",
    "the investigations of the low temperature pl kinetics put in evidence the energy transfer between bi@xmath0 ions and optical centers emitting in the range of 1000 - 1250 nm ( et@xmath18 ) .",
    "the latter were identified as the defects associated to ( or induced by ) the bismuth doping .",
    "the consistent empiric model of bi@xmath0 ion and associated defect is put forward to explain the peculiarities of the photoluminescence in a weakly doped with bismuth silica glasses .",
