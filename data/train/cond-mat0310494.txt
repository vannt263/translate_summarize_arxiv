    "properties of the models with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom have been actively studied from early 70-th , mostly in the context of the jahn - teller transition metal compounds.@xcite in recent years it has been a growing theoretical effort@xcite in order to understand the ground - state properties and excitation spectra of a particular ( high - symmetric ) class of one - dimensional spin - orbital models .",
    "the latter can also be viewed ( up to some slight modifications at most ) as two spin-@xmath3 heisenberg chains coupled via a bi - quadratic exchange .",
    "this interest is motivated by various unusual states , occurring in many kinds of low - dimensional magnetic systems : e.g. , tdae-@xmath4;@xcite two - leg spin-@xmath3 ladder compounds ( for a review , see ref . [ ] ) ; recently discovered spin - gapped materials @xmath5 ( @xmath6@xcite and @xmath1,@xcite which do not fit into the standard spin - peierls scenario .",
    "for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - orbital model there is a special point ( i.e. , coupling s values ) where the effective hamiltonian has an extra @xmath7 symmetry , and the exact solution has been known for quite a long time.@xcite another exactly solvable special point for the @xmath8-symmetric hamiltonian was found recently by kolezhuk and mikeska.@xcite apart of these special values of couplings , the available results on the 1d - spin - orbital models are known from mean - field analyses , renormalization group , bosonization , conformal field theory , numerics , and/or their combinations .    as was re - emphasized recently,@xcite from the view point of application to real materials we are mostly interested in , high symmetry of a spin - orbital hamiltonian is rather artificial .",
    "even if the total spin is conserved from physical grounds , i.e. , the symmetry of the hamiltonian s spin sector is indeed @xmath9 , the symmetry of the orbital sector is usually lower ( e.g. , ising or @xmath0-type ) .",
    "so , applicability of the results obtained from high - symmetric hamiltonians ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) to the cases of low - symmetric hamiltonians following from microscopic considerations of a given problem , is not so straightforward.@xcite    it has been argued that the spin - gapped compounds @xmath5@xcite and @xmath1@xcite can be modeled by a two - band quarter - filled hubbard hamiltonian . in the regime of strong on - site",
    "coulomb repulsion such hamiltonian can be mapped onto a spin - orbital model,@xcite so the appearance of a spin gap is due to interplay between the charge and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "instead , one can work directly with the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "phase diagram of the 1d quarter - filled two - band hubbard model ( hubbard ladder ) has been recently studied both numerically@xcite and analytically.@xcite    in this paper we will explore a particular scenario for the spin gap mechanism in a spin - orbit model , where the orbital ( `` pseudospin '' ) degree of freedom corresponds physically to the ordering charge displacement ( disproportionation ) .",
    "such a model appears in the applications to @xmath1.@xcite the quarter - filled ladder - system@xcite @xmath1 is up - to - date the only well - established transition - metal compound with a localized spin-@xmath3 moment distributed , in the high - temperature phase , equally over two transition - metal ions in a mixed valence state .",
    "this unique situation of two @xmath10 ions sharing one spin @xmath11 leaves room for the charge disproportionation @xmath12 occurring below the critical temperature of @xmath13 , together with the opening of a spin - gap ( without a long - range order for spins ) . at @xmath2 the unit cell",
    "doubles both along the ladders ( @xmath14-direction ) and along the rungs ( @xmath15-direction ) , see ref .",
    "[ ] for a review",
    ".    there have been several mechanisms proposed for the driving force of this phase transition : the spin - phonon coupling like in a spin - peierls system,@xcite the electron - phonon coupling , the intra - ladder coulomb repulsion between @xmath16 and @xmath17-ions on the neighboring rungs@xcite , or a combination of those interaction terms.@xcite the experiments seem however to rule out@xcite the original proposal@xcite for the spin - peierls scenario , while the zigzag charge ordering pattern predicted by the coulomb - driven scenarios of this phase transition,@xcite is now established crytallographically.@xcite another argument in favor of the key role played by the charge ordering at this phase transition , comes from the fact that the coupling between spins and zigzag - ordered charge leads to@xcite the observed dispersion@xcite along the @xmath15-direction ( perpendicular to the ladders ) of the gapped magnon mode in the low - temperature phase .",
    "since @xmath1 is an insulator , one can model the charge degrees of freedom in @xmath1 on a given rung by a pseudospin @xmath18 . the system of quarter - filled coupled ladders can be mapped onto a triangular lattice where one spin and one pseudospin reside on the same site@xcite , compare fig .",
    "[ latfig ] .",
    "mostovoy and khomskii in their study of @xmath1 proposed the following mechanism for the spin dimerization driven by charge ordering ( i.e. , spin gap generation in the _ charge ordered phase_):@xcite the antiferroelectric ( afe ) in - ladder ordering ( i.e. , zigzag charge ordering ) is due to the inter - rung coulomb repulsion .",
    "the ordering pattern is shifted by a half of the inter - rung distance from ladder to ladder ( see fig.[latfig ] ) , and it results in alternation of the spin - exchange coupling along the ladder induced by its left and right neighbors .",
    "then , as a consequence of the spin - exchange dimerization , the systems acquires a spin gap",
    ". mostovoy and khomskii@xcite also pointed out that for this effect to occur , it suffices for the dimerization term of the spin - exchange coupling ( i.e , the inter - ladder spin - pseudospin coupling ) to be linear over the charge order parameter .",
    "this mechanism resembles so the familiar spin - peierls scenario , with the proviso that phonons are replaced by the charge order parameter .",
    "going deeper into this suggestion for the coupling which could be a key to the problem of @xmath1 , we perform a detailed analysis of such a phase transition starting from a simplest possible hamiltonian compatible with symmetry restrictions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is that of the ising model in transverse field ( imtf ) for pseudospins @xmath18 , coupled to the spin-@xmath3 @xmath0-chains .",
    "since the phase transition in @xmath1 is _ thermal _ in nature , we treat the charge ( pseudospin ) sector of the hamiltonian in the molecular - field approximation , while retaining in our analysis the experimentally observed 1d nature of the spin excitations .",
    "recent x - ray@xcite and nmr@xcite experiments showed large fluctuation regions on the both sides of @xmath2 in @xmath1 , and the order parameter critical index is found to be @xmath19 .",
    "it is close to @xmath20 of the 2d ising model , indicating along with the correlation lengths measurements@xcite on the 2d - ising universality class of this phase transition .",
    "according to ref .",
    "[ ] the 1d character of structural fluctuations manifests itself only at @xmath21k .",
    "this allows us to expect the mean - field treatment to be a qualitatively reasonable approximation for the problem we are dealing with .",
    "we find that our spin - pseudospin model has a phase diagram with two phases : the disordered one without charge order or spin gap ; and the ordered low - temperature phase with both the anti - ferroelectric ( zigzag ) charge order and spin gap .",
    "one of our most important findings is that the model _ always _ orders ( continuously , via a second - order transition ) into that phase at low temperatures .",
    "the critical temperature of this phase transition shows various regimes of dependence on model s parameters , but it never vanishes as far as the inter - ladder spin - pseudospin coupling is non - zero .",
    "physically , it means that the role of the inter - ladder coupling is twofold : this coupling not only creates the spin gap when the phase transition is driven by the charge ( pseudospin ) ordering in the imtf , but it also destroys the quantum critical point of the imtf and generates the charge - ordered and spin - gapped phase in the case when charge ordering in the pure imtf is impossible .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mofo ]",
    "we define the model hamiltonian and describe the methods employed to handle it . in section [ mf ]",
    "we present the mean - field equations which govern the critical behavior of the system .",
    "section [ tcr ] presents the analysis of the phase diagram , i.e. , the critical temperature of the anti - ferroelectric phase transition as a function of the hamiltonian s couplings .",
    "the results for the order parameter , spin and pseudospin susceptibilities , specific heat capacity calculated in the vicinity of the anti - ferroelectric phase transition are given in section [ afe ] .",
    "the summary of our results and the discussion on their application for @xmath1 are presented in the final section [ concl ] .",
    "we choose the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spin operators for a given site are defined as @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) via the pauli matrices @xmath25 .",
    "the pseudospin operators are related in the same way to the pauli matrices @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "we use the distinct notations for the pauli matrices @xmath28 in order to emphasize the fact that they operate in different spaces ( spin , pseudospin ) .",
    "so the components , e.g. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not have the same quantization axis . by labelling the two sets of pauli s matrices",

    "note in making comparison with the microscopic hamiltonians derived for @xmath1,@xcite that in our hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) we made the @xmath34-rotation in the pseudospin space @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side of eq.([ham ] ) correspond to the ising model in transverse field ( imtf ) , the third term to the heisenberg hamiltonian , and in the last one which describes the spin - pseudospin interaction @xmath37 , we retain only linear term over the rung charge displacement operator @xmath38 . this inter - ladder coupling term is allowed by the point symmetry group @xmath39 ( the @xmath1 space group is @xmath40).@xcite note that a similar intra - ladder spin - pseudospin coupling @xmath41 would be odd with respect to the mirror - plane through the bridging - oxygen ( the @xmath42-plane ) , therefore it is forbidden by symmetry .    in the following we will work with the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath43 @xmath44~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dimensionless temperature @xmath45 , and dimensionless couplings @xmath46 where the dimerization operator @xmath47 .",
    "for the applications we have in mind , the range of the model s parameters under consideration will be restricted to the cases @xmath48 in the present study we consider the hamiltonian with the @xmath0 spin - spin interaction , i.e. , @xmath49 where we used the conventional definition @xmath50 .",
    "we proceed with the approximate treatment of our model in the following way : the model hamiltonian ( [ hamdls ] ) can be viewed as @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the hamiltonian of the imtf in terms of the pseudospin operators @xmath53 which is exactly solvable by its own .",
    "dependence of the effective coupling @xmath54 on @xmath53 in the @xmath0 spin hamiltonian @xmath55 precludes the total hamiltonian from being exactly solvable .",
    "we apply a version of the mean field approximation ( mfa ) which is rather known as the molecular field method ( approximation ) in the theory of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "this approximation assumes separability of the total hamiltonian density matrix @xmath56 over @xmath57 and @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath58 and the following single particle ( operator ) ansatz for the pseudospin density matrix @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the on - site vector of the molecular field to be defined self - consistently , @xmath61 is inverse temperature ( we set the boltzmann constant @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 in the on - site partition function .",
    "since the independent spin - pseudospin averaging ( [ stsep ] ) with the single - particle density matrix ( [ rhotsing ] ) makes @xmath64 a function of the average values of @xmath53 , no further approximation is needed for the density matrix @xmath65 . the statistical mechanical problem with",

    "strictly speaking this does not cause problems for our choice of hamiltonian ( [ hamdls ] ) , since its spin part does not couple different ladders .",
    "however we find this situation with the 1d jwt somehow unpleasant , especially keeping in mind possible generalizations of the present hamiltonian for future work .",

    "our analysis reveals an important property of the phase diagram , not envisaged in the original mostovoy - khomskii proposal : the inter - ladder spin - pseudospin coupling ( @xmath121 ) not only creates the spin dimerization ( spin gap ) triggered by the charge ordering in the region of ising s coupling where the imtf can order ( @xmath298 ) , but it also generates simultaneous appearance of the charge order and spin gap in the case when the imtf is always disordered ( @xmath299 ) .",

    "an interesting feature of model s phase diagram is that near the imtf critical coupling @xmath155 it shows regimes with a re - entrance ( for couplings @xmath167 , @xmath145 ) or with a double re - entrance ( for couplings @xmath167 , @xmath188 ) . how pronounced the re - entrant behavior is , depends on the interplay of couplings , but the re - entrance is absent when @xmath162 .",
    "usually , re - entrance is due either to disorder effects,@xcite or due to the stabilization of the ordered phase via the release of entropy by secondary degrees of freedom.@xcite the imtf does not show any re - entrance at the mean - field level,@xcite but accounting for the first - order fluctuation corrections revealed some re - entrance in the 2d imtf.@xcite in that study it was assumed to be an artifact of poor approximation . in our case , we have given some qualitative arguments on how the re - entrant behavior can be understood from the competition of model s energy scales .",

    "however , we think we have grasped the qualitatively correct physics .",
    "the question why @xmath2 is so low in @xmath1 , or what is the scale that gives such a low @xmath2 , can be answered as follows : @xmath175 for @xmath1 lies in the proximity of the quantum critical point of the imtf ( most likely on the  disordered side , i.e. , @xmath319 ) .",
    "@xmath2 is determined by the two scales : @xmath320 and the inter - ladder dimerization coupling @xmath121 .",
    "the latter destroys the imtf quantum critical point and makes the ordering possible at @xmath319 .",
    "a flaw of the present study is that we can not account for the large bcs ratio @xmath256 observed in @xmath1 .",
    "the small value of @xmath2 indicates that we are either in the bcs regime described by the analytical result ( [ tcas ] ) , or very close to it , so the ratio can not exceed the universal bcs value ( [ bcsratio ] ) .",
    "this gives the spin gap almost two times smaller than the experimental value .",
    "this clearly indicates that for more realistic calculations the spin part of the hamiltonian should be modified , and instead of the @xmath0 spin model the full three component heisenberg hamiltonian should be considered . as we have already explained it in section [ chispin ] , this will change results for the bcs ratio . at this point",
    "we can not say whether this will be enough in order to explain the experimentally observed magnitude of the ratio .",
    "another possibility is of course , the role of modes , neglected in our model , like , e.g. , phonons , which can affect the bcs ratio .",
    "however , we will not speculate more on this point .",
    "experiments of various kinds@xcite unequivocally demonstrate that what occurs in @xmath1 at @xmath321 k is a ( thermal ) continuous structural phase transition . also",
    "rather large regions of structural ( charge - ordering ) two - dimensional fluctuations are seen@xcite on the both sides of @xmath2 .",
    "the order parameter critical index@xcite @xmath19 is close to what one expects for a two - dimensional phase transition with a one - component order parameter .",
    "so we conclude that the universality class of this transition is the 2d ising . in order to obtain a more complete description of the transition in @xmath1 , thermal fluctuations in the imtf - sector of the spin - pseudospin hamiltonian",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "according to what we said above , we expect the ising coupling for the @xmath1-hamiltonian to lie near the quantum critical point of the 2d imtf . from the experimental results we expect that physics of @xmath1 near @xmath2 is controlled by the region of the 2d imtf phase diagram,@xcite where 2d ising ( thermal ) fluctuations dominate .",
    "although at lower temperatures the change of the nature of these fluctuations into 3d ising ( quantum),@xcite may also become important .",
    "we believe that apart from the applications to @xmath1 , a study of the fluctuations in proximity of this quantum critical point is a very interesting problem of its own .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the pseudospin sector of our hamiltonian is only _ quasi _ two - dimensional , in the sense that pseudospins on neighboring ladders are coupled only via the dimerization coupling @xmath121 .",
    "accounting for the ising coupling between ladders , as one can see from the triangular lattice mapping shown in fig.[latfig ] , will cause a frustration .",
    "the neglect of this coupling for the applications to @xmath1 is justified from microscopic grounds , but from a general point of view it would be interesting to study a hamiltonian , similar to ours , with a truly two - dimensional imtf part .",

    "<S> we study the spin - pseudospin hamiltonian of the ising model in transverse field ( imtf ) for pseudospins , coupled to the @xmath0-spins on a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this model appears from analyses of the quarter - filled ladder compound @xmath1 , and pseudospins represent its charge degrees of freedom . in the molecular - field approximation </S>",
    "<S> we find that the model possesses two phases : charge - disordered without spin gap ; and a low - temperature phase containing both the anti - ferroelectric ( zigzag ) charge order and spin dimerization ( spin gap ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition is of the second kind , and the calculated physical quantities are as those one expects from the landau theory . </S>",
    "<S> one of particular features of the phase diagram is that the inter - ladder spin - pseudospin coupling , responsible for the spin gap generation , also destroys the imtf quantum critical point , resulting in the exponential behavior of @xmath2 in the region of ising s coupling where the imtf is always disordered . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that our mean - field results give a qualitatively correct description of the phase transition in @xmath1 , while a more sophisticated analysis is warranted in order to take into account the thermal fluctuations and , probably , the proximity of the imtf quantum critical point . </S>"
