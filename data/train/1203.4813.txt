    "a main goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments is to understand electroweak symmetry breaking . in the standard model ( sm ) , it is achieved by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar higgs field .",
    "however , a fundamental scalar field receives quadratically divergent radiative contribution to its mass - squared and suffers from the hierarchy problem .",
    "one of the most promising solutions to the hierarchy problem is supersymmetry ( susy ) which introduces a superpartner to every sm field , so that the quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass - squared can be canceled between sm particles and their superpartners .",
    "supersymmetry has been extensively searched for at colliders , and so far we have not found any evidence for it .",
    "the latest lhc search results constrain the masses of the gluino and ( light generation ) squarks in the minimal supergravity  @xcite or constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite to be greater than about 1tev  @xcite . at face value",
    ", it may imply a serious fine - tuning of the electroweak scale if susy exists .",
    "however , as the largest radiative correction to the higgs mass in the sm comes from the top quark loop , only the top superpartners ( stops ) need to be light enough to cancel the top loop contribution  @xcite .",
    "the gluino and first two generation squarks can be heavier than 1tev without a naturalness problem , at least at one - loop level  @xcite .",
    "therefore , searching for the top superpartners at the lhc offers the most important test of whether susy provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "many third generation squark searches at the lhc rely on gluino production , with subsequent decay to stops or sbottoms  @xcite .",
    "this is because the production cross section for gluino is much larger than for direct stop or sbottom production , as long as the gluino mass is not much heavier .",
    "however , since the naturalness of the electroweak breaking scale does not require gluino to be light enough to be copiously produced at the 7 or 8 tev lhc , a more robust stop search would only rely on direct stop pair production . in this paper",
    "we focus on the stop search in this channel in a standard @xmath4-parity conserving susy scenario . here",
    "the stop decays to a top quark and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is assumed to be a neutralino .",
    "although a light neutralino is not required by naturalness , it avoids the stable charged particle problem and provides a natural candidate for dark matter .",
    "the signal we are looking for is @xmath5 where the missing transverse energy @xmath6 comes from the pair of neutralino lsp s which escape the detector .",
    "we also assume that the mass difference between the stop and the lsp is substantially larger than the top quark mass .",
    "otherwise the signal will strongly overlap with the sm backgrounds , which would need some different search strategies  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath7 signal also occurs in many other extensions of the sm that include a dark matter candidate .",
    "it is quite natural to mitigate the hierarchy problem with a relatively light top `` partner '' that decays to the top quark and the dark matter particle .",
    "this is possible if the partner is also charged under the symmetry that protects the stability of the dark matter particle .",
    "examples are the little higgs models with @xmath8-parity  @xcite , models with the exotic fourth generation and dark matter  @xcite , models with gauged baryon and lepton numbers  @xcite , and so on .",
    "consequently , the same search applies to many different models , but the mass - reach depends on each model s top partner production cross section .",
    "studies of the @xmath5 signal for new physics have been performed by many groups in various ( fully hadronic , single - lepton ) channels in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the atlas collaboration at the lhc has done such a search in the single - lepton channel based on 1.04fb@xmath3 of data  @xcite . in the single - lepton channel , one @xmath2 from the top",
    "decays leptonically and the other @xmath2 decays hadronically . requiring one lepton in the final state suppresses qcd multijet backgrounds tremendously while still retaining a significant @xmath2 branching fraction .",
    "the final state signal consists of four ( or more ) jets ( including two @xmath9-jets ) , one lepton , and missing transverse energy . besides the standard transverse momentum @xmath10 and pseudo - rapidity @xmath11 requirements for each object , the two main variables used for separating the signal and backgrounds are the missing transverse energy @xmath6 and the transverse mass @xmath12 constructed from the lepton and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the signal events are expected to have large @xmath6 from the top - partner decays , along with a neutrino from the leptonic @xmath2 .",
    "a hard cut on @xmath6 very effectively reduces the sm backgrounds .",
    "the cut on @xmath12 removes the backgrounds where the @xmath6 is mostly due to a single neutrino from a @xmath2 decay because the @xmath12 distribution has an end point at @xmath13 in such cases .",
    "the existing atlas study focused on a fermionic top partner and can exclude this partner s mass up to 420gev  @xcite .",
    "there was no sensitivity to the susy stop with this limited amount of data because of the much smaller cross section for the scalar particles .",
    "last year s run already delivered more than 5fb@xmath3 of data .",
    "this year , the lhc is expected to deliver even more luminosity at a higher center of mass energy of 8tev .",
    "given the importance of the stop ( and other top - partner ) search , it is desirable to extend the mass reach using current and future data .    the single - lepton channel analysis of the atlas top partner search paper  @xcite found that the largest background remaining after the their cuts on @xmath6 and @xmath12 is the dileptonic @xmath14 .",
    "in these background events , both @xmath2 s decay leptonically , but one of the leptons is not reconstructed , is outside the detector acceptance , or is a @xmath15 lepton ( which may be misidentified as a jet ) .",
    "each event contains at least two neutrinos that can produce a large @xmath6 and also make it easier to pass the @xmath12 cut .",
    "the additional jets come from qcd initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "the next - to - largest background comes from the semileptonic @xmath14 and @xmath2+jets .",
    "the other backgrounds are small after the @xmath6 and @xmath12 cuts . to improve the search reach",
    ", we designed kinematic variables to identify @xmath14 backgrounds , focusing on its decay topology .",
    "we find that the signal significance and mass reach can indeed be substantially improved with the help of these variables .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss several such variables . in section  [",
    "sec : performance ] , we compare the performances of the basic set of cuts and cuts including the new variables , identifying an economical set .",

    "the signal contains four jets , one lepton , and missing transverse energy . according to the latest atlas @xmath20 search  @xcite , the largest sm background after the @xmath6 and @xmath12 cuts is @xmath0 in the dileptonic channel with one lost lepton and two additional jets from isr that fake the hadronic @xmath2 . in this section we try to identify some kinematic variables , based on these _ background _ event topologies .",

    "in this paper we have focused on suppressing the @xmath14 backgrounds for the search of direct stop production . however , the standard model @xmath14 production is a major background for a wide range of new physics searches at the lhc .",
    "the kinematic variables proposed here could also be useful in improving searches for other new physics where the @xmath14 constitutes the main background with a large missing transverse momentum for the signals .",
    "comparing the performances of different variables shows that in general the more kinematic information a variable contains , the more discriminant power it can possess . for more specific new physics searches where both the signal and main background event topologies are known ,",
    "it is worth designing kinematic variables which carry as much information of the signal and/or the background events as possible to achieve the maximal discrimination between them .",
    "the strategy of constructing new kinematic variables discussed in this paper could be readily generalized to other cases .",
    "we would like to thank the collaboration of markus luty in the early stage of this work , and michael peskin for useful discussion and comments .",
