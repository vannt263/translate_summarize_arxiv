    "the oscillatory nature of exchange coupling between two ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers separated by a metallic but non - magnetic ( nm ) spacer as a function of the spacer thickness d@xmath13 is now well established in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the coupling is driven by the rudderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky)-type exchange through the conduction electrons of the spacer @xcite .",
    "the period of oscillations predicted by the theories of exchange coupling is directly related to the extremal wave vectors connecting opposite sides of the fermi surface ( fs ) of the spacer material in the direction of the layer growth . clearly , the nature of the fermi surface of the spacer plays a key role in interlayer exchange .",
    "ipr and gyrffy @xcite first suggested that an experiment in which the fermi surface could be changed while keeping all other material parameters the same , would allow a direct test of the exchange coupling theories based on extremal wave vectors of the fs .",
    "they proposed the use of a superconducting ( sc ) spacer in which an isotropic gap opens up at the fs on cooling below the critical temperature t@xmath12 .",
    "the zero - temperature numerical calculations of ipr and gyrffy @xcite show that the oscillatory coupling is strongly damped in the presence of a superconducting gap .",
    "similarly , the analytical results of de melo @xcite show that at @xmath14/t @xmath15 1 the coupling decays exponentially as @xmath16 , where k@xmath17 , d@xmath18 , @xmath14 and e@xmath19 are the fermi wave - vector , spacer thickness , gap parameter and fermi energy respectively .",
    "near t@xmath12 the large thermally excited quasiparticle density compensates for the loss of coupling seen at low temperatures .",
    "experimental verification of these predictions is , however , constrained by several materials related factors .",
    "first of all , since the oscillatory coupling is seen only when the spacer thickness is small ( @xmath20 130  ) , one must ensure that superconductivity survives in such thin spacers in the presence of the strong pair - breaking effects of the ferromagnetic boundaries .",
    "naturally , short coherence length @xmath21 and high critical temperature t@xmath12 of the superconductor , and small exchange energy of the ferromagnet are the desirable features to see the effect . in addition",
    ", one must also ensure that the interfaces between the ferromagnetic and superconducting layers are atomically smooth .",
    "the doped mott insulators of the perovskite oxide family meet some of these material specifications .",
    "for example , yba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath4 ( ybco ) superconductor and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) ferromagnet can be grown epitaxially on top of each other .",
    "the cuprate has anisotropic but short coherence length and a high t@xmath12 , whereas the manganite with a curie temperature of @xmath22 360 k , has relatively small exchange energy j ( @xmath7 1 mev ) as compared to the j of 3d transition metal ferromagnets such as fe and co which are strong pair - breakers @xcite .",
    "however , the cuprates also pose interesting challenges , such as the nodal gap parameters @xmath14 and anomalous c - axis transport , not present in elemental superconductors .",
    "reported measurements on high t@xmath12 superconductor ( htsc)-manganite heterostructures have primarily focused on the suppression of t@xmath12 @xcite , spin injection @xcite and the effects on magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "recently , the aspect of exchange coupling across htsc layers has been addressed by przyslupski et al .",
    "@xcite using ( la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath23/(yba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath24 multilayers where n = 16 unit cells , and m varies from 1 to 8 unit cells .",
    "measurements of field - cooled ( fc ) and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) magnetization loops in these samples reveal exchange biasing effects , which have been argued to be an indicator of interlayer exchange coupling .",
    "however , this work also attributes the shift of the fc and zfc loops to antiferromagnetism in lsmo . here",
    "it needs to be pointed out that these multilayers have been deposited on laalo@xmath2 substrates , which introduce large compressive stress in lsmo and ybco epitaxial films due to its smaller lattice parameter ( @xmath7 3.79  ) .",
    "in addition , laalo@xmath2 is a heavily twinned material .",
    "since both these factors are known to affect magnetic anisotropy of lsmo @xcite and superconducting properties of ybco @xcite , intrinsic behavior of fm - sc - fm structure is likely to get masked by such stress and interface related effects .",
    "further , the interface related non - intrinsic behavior is likely to get accentuated in superlattices due to the presence of a large number of interfaces in such structures .",
    "here we report the magnetic behavior of lsmo - ybco - lsmo trilayers , synthesized on [ 001 ] srtio@xmath2 substrates .",
    "the lattice parameter of srtio@xmath2 ( @xmath7 3.91  ) compares well with the lattice parameter of l@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath7 3.89  ) and the average ab - plane lattice spacing of yba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath4 ( @xmath7 3.85  ) .",
    "the scope for a stress - free layer - by - layer growth has been improved further through special chemical treatment of the substrate @xcite .",
    "we first describe the magnetic behavior of plane lsmo films of various thickness .",
    "high quality epitaxial layers of lsmo showing a soft magnetic character and in - plane anisotropy were integrated with ybco in a trilayer form and the superconducting critical temperature of such structures was measured .",
    "the suppression in t@xmath12 has been attributed to the pair breaking effects at the fm - sc boundary .",
    "finally , the issue of interlayer exchange coupling has been addressed through measurements of zfc in - plane magnetization loops over a broad range of temperatures .",
    "these measurements reveal a long range antiferromagnetic coupling between lsmo layers decaying exponentially with the thickness of the ybco spacer .",
    "thin films of lsmo , and trilayers of lsmo - ybco - lsmo and prba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath25 - yba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath25 - prba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath4 ( pbco - ybco - pbco ) were deposited on chemically polished [ 001 ] oriented srtio@xmath2 substrates . a multitarget pulsed laser deposition technique based on krf excimer laser ( @xmath26= 248 nm )",
    "was used to deposit the films and trilayers at 800 @xmath27c and 200 mtorr o@xmath3 partial pressure @xcite .",
    "since the growth conditions for all three oxides were identical , the trilayers were deposited sequentially without changing the process parameters .",
    "a slow deposition rate ( @xmath7 1  / sec ) established through several calibration runs , was used to realize a layer - by - layer growth of lsmo , pbco , and ybco . while for the plane lsmo films we have studied the changes in transport and magnetic properties as a function of thickness from 50  to 1100  , the thickness of each lsmo layer in lsmo - ybco - lsmo trilayers was fixed at 300  , and the thickness of the cuprate",

    "the m - h loops of some samples at 100 k are shown in fig .",
    "6 .    a straightforward explanation for the existence of h@xmath18 can be given by invoking antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the lsmo layers separated by normal and superconducting ybco",

    "first of all , the interfaces of perovskite oxides based multilayers have an inherent stereochemical disorder even when they are atomically sharp @xcite .",
    "this disorder is caused by a change in the nearest neighbor environment of the magnetically active ions , and can lead to random pinning of their moment . while a gradual depinning of these moments with the increasing field would lead to deviations from a square hysteresis loop typical of a soft magnet such as lsmo ,",
    "it is not likely to result in the m - h loops seen in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "one may also argue that the uncompensated copper spins at the interface help stabilize this random state . in order to rule out these possibilities ,",
    "we have measured the m - h loops of lsmo - pbco - lsmo trilayers . in fig .",

    "the calculated j@xmath9(t ) shows a steep increase at the lower temperatures where the experimental data reach saturation .",
    "this truncation of the theoretically expected growth of j@xmath9 below t@xmath12 is suggestive of a superconducting gap .",
    "the antiferromagnetic coupling energy ( j@xmath90 calculated using the relation @xmath91 ( eq .",

    "inset : the dependence of j@xmath9 on the thickness of the ybco spacer is plotted at 20 k and 100 k. a characteristic decay length of @xmath7 150  was obtained by fitting these data to a first order exponentially decaying function ( shown as the solid lines).,width=302 ]    although the physics of magnetic coupling across a superconducting spacer of anisotropic order parameter is an enormously complicated problem to analyze , the following arguments can be made on the basis of the data shown in fig . 5 through fig .",
    "we first consider the case when ybco is in the normal state .",
    "the coupling in this situation is mediated by the transport of carriers perpendicular to cuo@xmath3 planes in these c - axis - oriented films . while the resistivity of ybco along the c - axis shows a variety of behaviors depending on doping concentration and defect structure , for optimally doped ybco it is metallic , but larger by a factor of @xmath7 50 compared to the in - plane resistivity @xcite .",
    "the c - axis transport in optimally doped and overdoped ybco involves blocking of coherent interplanar tunneling by the in - plane scattering .",
    "this leads to @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99@xcite . in underdoped systems",
    "diffusive tunneling dominates the transport , leading to a semiconductor like resistivity @xcite .",
    "the non - oscillatory and predominantly antiferromagnetic iec seen here is analogous to the behavior of exchange coupling in fe - fesi - fe @xcite and fe - si - fe @xcite heterostructures .",
    "the iec in this case is strongly antiferromagnetic ( j@xmath9 @xmath7 2 erg/@xmath100 for a thin spacer , and decays exponentially with the increasing spacer thickness .",
    "furthermore , the exchange energy j@xmath9 shows a monotonic drop with the increasing temperature , a behavior similar to the data shown in fig .",
    "a bias towards antiferromagnetic iec has been predicted theoretically as well .",
    "shi , levy and fry @xcite have shown that this bias for af - coupling arises from a competition between the rkky  like exchange and superexchange , and a non - cancellation of the non - oscillatory parts of these two contributions .",
    "an af coupling , which decays exponentially with the spacer thickness , has been predicted by slonczewski @xcite and bruno @xcite using an electron tunneling picture .",
    "the theory @xcite predicts a d@xmath13 dependence of the type @xmath101 .",
    "the calculated value of the coupling energy j@xmath9 for our trilayers is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "9 as a function of the spacer layer thickness .",
    "we have fitted these data to a first - order exponential decay of the type given by bruno et al .",
    "result of this fitting is shown as solid - lines in the inset .",
    "the characteristic decay length @xmath26 inferred from the fit is @xmath7 150  .",
    "since the c - axis transport in ybco is controlled by a delicate balance between single electron tunneling and intralayer electron - electron scattering processes @xcite , a tunneling picture for iec is applicable , albeit with the caveat that it is unlike the tunneling through a semiconducting barrier where thermally induced carriers can enhance iec at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "the iec in this case is expected to decay with temperature as the c - axis resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence .",
    "the truncation of the monotonic growth of the exchange coupling energy when the ybco layer becomes superconducting ( as seen in fig .",
    "9 ) is in agreement with the predictions of ipr and gyrffy @xcite , and of de melo @xcite .",
    "however , the extent of the drop in the coupling energy in the t = 0 limit depends on the strength of the superconducting gap parameter . for a weak ferromagnet and an isotropic superconductor , de melo @xcite",
    "has derived an analytic expression for the effective coupling hamiltonian ;    @xmath102    where , k@xmath19 and d@xmath18 are the fermi momentum and thickness of the s - layer respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the superconducting gap and e@xmath19 is the fermi energy .",
    "this expression shows that the superconducting order does not actually contribute to the oscillating part of the interaction , it only induces a relative decrease in the strength of interaction as compared to the interaction for a normal metallic spacer .",
    "however , the low temperature calculations in refs . 8 and 9 are valid only for an isotropic gap parameter .",
    "de melo has recently considered the case of iec through a d - wave superconductor whose order parameter lies in the plane of the multilayer @xcite .",
    "the main contribution to coupling in this case comes from the wave vectors connecting points at the fermi surface along the [ 001 ] direction and for @xmath103 lying along the direction of nodes . a distinct suppression , although not as much as in the case of a fully gapped system , has been seen in the superconducting state .",
    "in summary , we have studied the magnetic and superconducting states of epitaxial thin film heterostructures consisting of two la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath104layers separated by a layer of yba@xmath3cu@xmath2o@xmath4 , whose c - axis is perpendicular to the plane of the heterostructure .",
    "we see a distinct influence of the ferromagnetic boundaries on the t@xmath12 of the ybco layer .",
    "this is attributed to the pair - breaking phenomena near the f - s interface .",
    "the hysteresis loops for in - plane magnetization of the heterostructures show signatures of an antiferromagnetic coupling between the moments of the two lsmo layers in the superconducting as well as the normal state of the spacer .",
    "the temperature dependence of the exchange coupling energy shows a monotonic growth followed by saturation on lowering the temperature .",
    "the long range coupling was found to decrease exponentially with the increasing thickness of the spacer layer .",
