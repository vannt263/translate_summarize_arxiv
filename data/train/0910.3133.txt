    "ever since the work of lennard - jones @xcite has the interaction between atoms and surfaces been of interest in many fields of physics , chemistry and technology .",
    "the seminal work by casimir and polder @xcite demonstrated that the shift in atomic energy levels close to a conductor is a probe for the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , a key concept of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in this context , a nonzero temperature becomes relevant for several aspects of the atom - surface interaction : thermally excited motion of the surface ( phonons ) and inelastic scattering of atomic beams @xcite , occupation of excited atomic energy levels , and enhancement of field fluctuations due to thermal photons @xcite .",
    "the latter aspect is usually associated with distances from the surface larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath1 , approximately @xmath2 at room temperature .",
    "the free energy of interaction typically shows a change in power law with distance around this point : generally , it is enhanced with respect to zero temperature and becomes proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this is the classical limit where the interaction is mainly entropic in character @xcite .",
    "experimental progress in recent years has achieved the sensitivity required to detect the small energy shifts that occur at distances on the order of @xmath4 , making use of the exquisite control over the motion of atomic beams ( beam deflection @xcite , quantum reflection @xcite ) or clouds of ultracold laser - cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "the latter can be handled precisely in miniaturized traps implemented near solid state surfaces known as _ atom chips _",
    "these devices use optical or magnetic fields for trapping and can hold atomic clouds at distances down to a few microns . here",
    ", the atom - surface interaction manifests itself typically as a distortion of the trapping potential ( loss of atoms through tunneling to the surface or change in the trap oscillation frequency ) .",
    "therefore , the design of such setups requires exact knowledge of atom - surface interactions and conversely , theory predictions can be tested experimentally with high precision .    a surprising result of the research on atom chips is the importance of magnetic field fluctuations near the surface arising from thermally excited currents in the material of the chip ( johnson noise related to ohmic dissipation ) .",
    "these fluctuations couple to the spin magnetic moment of the trapped atoms and are known to provoke the loss of atoms from the trap by flipping the sign of the potential @xcite . these losses are a main obstacle for technical applications and further down - scaling of atom chips .",
    "predictions that superconducting materials reduce the spin - flip induced losses significantly have recently been backed by trap lifetime measurements @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the magnetic dipole contribution to the atom - surface ( casimir - polder ) interaction including nonzero temperature .",
    "one would expect this to be a small correction to the electric dipole coupling @xcite because of the smallness of the transition matrix elements @xcite .",
    "yet , the strong magnetic mode density close to a metallic surface @xcite and experimental evidence for magnetic spin flips call for a reconsideration of the magnetic contribution .",
    "in addition , the thermal occupation of photonic modes is quite relevant because magnetic transitions occur at much lower frequencies than electric ones , leading to a stronger temperature dependence .",
    "finally , it is well - known that dispersion forces between dielectric and magnetic materials can be repulsive @xcite , as has been shown for the magnetic casimir - polder interaction at @xmath5 in ref.@xcite . we were thus led to investigate whether at distances beyond @xmath4 the total atom - surface interaction might be reduced due to the magnetic contribution .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the magnetic casimir - polder free energy of interaction at different temperatures and consider a few well - known models for the electromagnetic response of the surface . since ohmic losses are crucial for the thermal behavior , it is highly interesting to compare both normal metals and superconductors .",
    "the latter are described here in the frame of the two - fluid model and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the magnetic atom - surface coupling has very peculiar features unknown from its electrical equivalent .",
    "we find that for normal conductors at nonzero temperature , the magnetic dipole contribution to the interaction is reduced , while it is enhanced for superconductors and in certain non - equilibrium situations .",
    "this resembles the macroscopic casimir interaction between two dissipative plates , where the correct calculation of the force at large distances and nonzero temperatures has been the subject of debate @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ atom - surface interaction ] , we give a brief review of the formalism used to calculate atom - surface interactions .",

    "we conclude summarizing and discussing the main results .",
    "further technical details are given in the appendices .",
    "quite a lot of research has been done on the interaction between an atom and a surface @xcite .",
    "it can been shown from perturbation theory with respect to the multipolar atom - field coupling @xcite that the free energy of a polarizable particle at nonzero temperature @xmath3 has the following general form ( einstein summation convention ) @xmath6 . \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 is the ( magnetic or electric ) polarizability tensor for the atom in a thermal state of temperature @xmath3 , and @xmath8 is the ( corresponding ) green s tensor in the presence of the surface , defined in eq.([eq : def - induced - field ] ) below . in the planar geometry",
    "we are interested in , the green s tensor depends only on the atom - surface distance @xmath9 and on frequency .",
    "it is well known that eq.([eq1 ] ) has the same form for electric or magnetic dipole couplings @xcite ; our notation is adapted to the magnetic case .",
    "a simple and general derivation of eq . can be given following refs.@xcite .",
    "the effective interaction potential between a polarizable particle and the ( magnetic or electric ) field @xmath10 @xcite is given by @xmath11 the expectation value @xmath12 is taken in an equilibrium state of the non - coupled system at temperature @xmath3 and implicitly evaluates symmetrically ordered operator products ; @xmath13 is the ( magnetic or electric ) dipole operator and @xmath10 the corresponding field operator , evaluated at the atom position @xmath14 .",
    "the factor @xmath15 arises from a coupling constant integration ( excluding a permanently polarized atom ) . within first - order perturbation theory ,",
    "both the dipole moment @xmath16 and the field @xmath17 can be split into fluctuating ( fl ) and induced ( in ) parts : the fluctuating part describes the intrinsic equilibrium fluctuation , while the induced part arises in perturbation theory from the dipole coupling @xcite .",
    ". becomes @xmath18 here , we assume the fluctuating parts of the dipole and of the field to be decorrelated at this order .",
    "this assumption would break down at higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "note that while in eq.([eneq ] ) , the total dipole and field operators ( heisenberg picture ) commute at equal times , this is no longer true for their ` in ' and ` fl ' constituents in eq.([eq : f - split - in - fl ] ) .",
    "the induced quantities are given , in frequency space , by the retarded response functions @xcite @xmath19 where the frequency dependence allows for a temporal delay .",
    "the equilibrium fluctuations follow from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite @xmath20 ~ ,      \\label{eq : ftd_field } \\\\",

    "one uses the fact that the imaginary part of both green s tensor and polarizability tensor are odd in @xmath22 ( retarded response functions ) .",
    "the field correlations are needed at the same position @xmath23 , and it is easy to remove the divergent free - space contribution ( lamb shift ) from @xmath24 , by keeping in the green s tensor only the reflected part of the field @xcite . in a planar geometry , it follows from symmetry that the result can only depend on the dipole - surface distance @xmath9 .",
    "note that the green s tensor can also depend on temperature through the surface reflectivity . in a two - level model for the atom ,",
    "the thermal polarizability @xmath25 contains a stronger @xmath3-dependence because of a fermi - dirac - like statistics @xcite , see eq.([eq : two - level_polarizability ] ) below .",
    "eq . is often expressed in an equivalent form using the analyticity of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the upper half of the complex frequency plane . performing a rotation onto the imaginary frequency axis",
    "yields the so - called matsubara expansion @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the matsubara frequencies and the prime in the sum indicates that the @xmath30 term must be weighted by a prefactor @xmath15 .",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real expressions for @xmath33 .",

    "finally , the thermal occupation of photon modes @xmath42 in the second term in eq.([ws ] ) is the bose - einstein distribution . at @xmath5",
    "it occurs only for excited states , for which @xmath43 for @xmath41 ( see eqs.(4.3 , 4.4 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the real part of the green s tensor can be given an interpretation from the radiation reaction of a classical dipole oscillator @xcite .",
    "similarly , this term is practically absent for the electric casimir - polder interaction of ground - state atoms because of the higher transition frequencies , @xmath44 .    in the following , we call the matsubara sum ( first line ) in eq.([ws ] ) the _ non - resonant _ contribution , and the second line",
    "the _ resonant _ one , because it involves the field response at the atomic transition frequency .",
    "the formalism presented in the previous section is quite general and @xmath45 [ @xmath8 ] could represent either the magnetic or electric polarizability [ green s tensor ] , respectively .",
    "we now give the specific forms of these quantities in the magnetic case , focusing on a planar surface and specific trapping scenarios .",
    "the green s tensor for a planar surface can be calculated analytically .",
    "let the atom be on the positive @xmath47-axis at a distance @xmath9 from a medium occupying the half - space below the @xmath48-plane . by symmetry , the magnetic green s tensor @xmath49 is diagonal and invariant under rotations in the @xmath48-plane :    @xmath50 + 2\\frac{k^{2}}{\\kappa^{2}}r^{\\rm te}(\\omega , k ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat z\\hat z}\\right]e^{-2 \\kappa l } ~ , \\label{eq : magnetic_gf } \\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the vacuum permeability and @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the cartesian dyadic products .",
    "we consider here a local isotropic , nonmagnetic bulk medium [ @xmath55 , so that the fresnel formulae give the following reflection coefficients in the te- and tm - polarization ( also known as @xmath56- and @xmath57-polarization ) @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the propagation constants in vacuum and in the medium , respectively ( roots with @xmath61 ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the modulus of the in - plane wavevector .",
    "note that the magnetic green s tensor can be obtained from the electric one @xmath64 by swapping the reflection coefficients @xcite @xmath65    all information about the optical properties of the surface is encoded in the dielectric function @xmath66 .",
    "we will use four different commonly established descriptions , each of which includes ohmic dissipation in a very characteristic way . as it turns out , the magnetic casimir - polder interaction is much more sensitive to dissipation than the electric one ( see sec.[dissipative quenching ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the resonance frequencies in the magnetic polarizability @xmath67 are much lower ( see sec.[s : beta - and - alpha ] ) .",
    "the first model is a _ drude metal _",
    "@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the plasma frequency and @xmath70 is a phenomenological dissipation rate .",
    "this is the simplest model for a metal with finite conductivity .",
    "if @xmath71 is constant ( independent of temperature ) , the conductivity can be attributed to impurity scattering in the medium .",
    "the second model is the dissipationless _ plasma model _",
    "@xmath72 : here , one sets @xmath73 in the right - hand side of eq.([eq : def - drude - epsilon ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a purely imaginary conductivity .    in the context of atom chips ,",
    "the case of a _ superconductor _ is particularly interesting because dissipation is suppressed as the temperature @xmath3 drops below the critical temperature @xmath74 .",
    "we adopt here ( third model ) a description in terms of the two - fluid model , a weighted sum of a dissipationless supercurrent response ( plasma model ) and a normal conductor response @xmath75 \\varepsilon_\\mathrm{dr}(\\omega)~,\\\\ \\eta(t ) & = & \\left [ 1 - \\left(\\frac{t}{t_c}\\right)^4\\right ] \\theta(t_c -t ) ~ ,      \\label{eq : epsilon - two - fluid - model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the _ order parameter _ @xmath76 follows the gorter ",
    "casimir rule @xcite . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the superconductor coincides with the plasma model , as is known from the london theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the plasma model is thus the simplest description of a superconductor at zero temperature rather than a model for a normal metal .",
    "more involved descriptions of superconductors ( including bcs theory ) also reproduce the plasma behavior at low frequencies ( @xmath22 well below the bcs gap ) and temperature close to absolute zero .",
    "the full bcs theory of superconductivity can be applied in this context , too , using its optical conductivity @xcite , as recently discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall see below ( sec.[sec : superconductor ] ) , however , that the two - fluid model and bcs theory give very close results for realistic choices of the physical parameters .",
    "our fourth model takes a look at the peculiar case of a very clean metal . here , rather than by impurity scattering",
    ", dissipation is dominated by electron - electron or electron - phonon scattering . in these cases ,",
    "the dissipation rate in the drude formula  ( [ eq : def - drude - epsilon ] ) follows a characteristic power law @xmath77 at small temperatures and saturates to a constant value at high temperatures ( bloch - grneisen law ) .",
    "it is reasonable to call this system the _ perfect crystal _ model . as in a superconductor",
    ", dissipation is turned on by temperature , but in a completely different manner .",
    "this can be distinguished in the atom - surface interaction potential .      for the drude model ,",
    "there are three different regimes for the atom - surface distance that are determined by physical length scales of the system ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) : the skin depth in the medium , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the plasma wavelength , and the photon wavelength in vacuum , @xmath80 note that @xmath81 for frequencies @xmath82 ( hagen - rubens regime ) .",
    "this is the relevant regime for the relatively low magnetic resonance frequencies .",
    "we then have @xmath83 which leads to the following three domains : ( i ) the _ sub - skin - depth region _ , @xmath84 , ( ii ) the _ non - retarded region _ , @xmath85 , and ( iii ) the _ retarded region _ : @xmath86 . in zones ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , retardation can be neglected ( van - der - waals zone ) , while in zone ( iii ) , it leads to a different power law ( casimir - polder zone ) for the atom - surface interaction .",
    "since the boundaries of the three distance zones depend on frequency , the respective length scales differ by orders magnitude between the magnetic and the electric case . for electric dipole transitions ,",
    "the hagen ",
    "rubens regime can not be applied because the resonant photon wavelength is much smaller .",
    "the role of the skin depth is then taken by the plasma wavelength @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the casimir - polder zone ( iii ) for the electric dipole interaction occurs in a range of distances where magnetic retardation is still negligible [ zones ( i ) and ( ii ) ] .    in the three regimes ,",
    "different approximations for the reflection coefficients that appear in the green s function  ( [ eq : magnetic_gf ] ) can be made .",
    "we start with the drude model where in the _ sub - skin - depth zone _ @xcite , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89\\frac{\\omega^2}{4c^2k^2},\\nonumber\\\\ r^{\\rm tm}(\\omega , k)&\\approx & \\frac{\\epsilon(\\omega)-1}{\\epsilon(\\omega)+1}\\left[1 + \\frac{\\epsilon(\\omega)}{\\epsilon(\\omega)+1}\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2k^2}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : r_subskindepth } \\ ] ] at intermediate distances in the _ non - retarded zone _ , the wavevector is @xmath90 , hence , @xmath91 finally , in the _ retarded zone _ we can consider @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 a similar asymptotic analysis can be performed for the other model dielectric functions .",
    "it turns out that eqs.([eq : r_subskindepth][eq : epsilon_retarded ] ) can still be used , provided the assumption @xmath94 holds .",
    "this is indeed the case for a typical atomic magnetic dipole moment and a conducting surface .",
    "the asymptotics of the green s functions that correspond to these distance regimes are obtained by performing the @xmath95-integration in eq.([eq : magnetic_gf ] ) with the above approximations for the reflection coefficients .",
    "the results are collected in table [ magneticappr ] .",
    "one notes that the @xmath96-component is larger by a factor @xmath97 compared to the @xmath98- and @xmath99-components .",
    "the difference between the normal and parallel dipoles can be understood by the method of images @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic response for a normally conducting metal in the sub - skin - depth regime is purely imaginary and scales linearly with the frequency @xmath22  the reflected magnetic field is generated by induction .",
    "only the superconductor or the plasma model can reproduce a significant low - frequency magnetic response , via the meiner - ochsenfeld effect .",
    "in contrast , the electric response is strong for all conductors because surface charges screen the electric field efficiently .",
    "the imaginary part of the green s functions determines the local mode density ( per frequency ) for the magnetic or electric fields @xcite .",
    "these can be compared directly after multiplying by @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) , respectively . as is discussed in refs.@xcite , in the sub - skin - depth regime near a metallic surface ,",
    "the field fluctuations are mainly of magnetic nature .",
    "this can be traced back to surface charge screening that efficiently decouples the interior of the metal and the vacuum above .",
    "magnetic fields , however , cross the surface much more easily as surface currents are absent ( except for superconductors ) .",
    "this reveals , in the vacuum outside the metal , the thermally excited currents from the bulk .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +      the magnetic and electric polarizabilities are determined by the transition dipole matrix elements and the resonance frequencies .",
    "we are interested in the retarded response function , which for an arbitrary atomic state @xmath34 is given by eq.([eq : ws_polarizability ] ) above .",
    "when the atom is in thermal equilibrium , we have to sum the polarizability over the states @xmath34 with a boltzmann weight : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the partition function . in the limit @xmath104",
    ", we recover the polarizability for a ground state atom .",
    "for a two - level system with transition frequency @xmath105 , the previous expression takes a simple form and can be expressed in terms of the ground state polarizability [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ws_polarizability ] ) , where @xmath106 : @xmath107 let us now compare the electric and magnetic polarizabilities . the magnetic transition moment among states with zero orbital",
    "spin scales with @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the land factor for the electron spin and @xmath110 the bohr magneton .",
    "electric dipoles are on the order @xmath111 with @xmath112 the bohr radius .",
    "with the estimate that the resonance frequencies ( @xmath105 and @xmath113 ) determine the relevant range of frequencies , we have approximately @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "the magnetic interaction is thus expected to be a small correction .",
    "conversely , the narrower range of frequencies makes it much more sensitive to the influence of temperature .",
    "we have seen now that the polarizability of an atom takes a positive constant value at low frequency and the induced magnetic dipole is parallel to the magnetic field ( paramagnetism ) .",
    "let us consider for comparison a metallic nanosphere .",
    "if its radius @xmath116 is smaller than the penetration depth and the wavelength , the polarizability is given by @xcite @xmath117r^{3}~.\\ ] ] this quantity vanishes at low frequencies and has a negative real part ( diamagnetism ) . for a qualitative comparison to an atom one can estimate , e.g. , the magnetic oscillator strength , defined by the integral over the imaginary part of the polarizability at real frequencies @xmath118 from the clausius - mossotti relation follows the electric counterpart : @xmath119 we find that the nanoparticle has a dominantly electric response , similar to an atom , but the ratio of the oscillator strengths depends on the material parameters and the radius . from the above expressions , we find that the absolute value of the nanosphere s magnetic oscillator strength is actually smaller than the one of an atom if the sphere s radius @xmath120 .",
    "the resonance frequencies relevant for the magnetic casimir - polder potential depend on the trapping scheme .",
    "we focus here on alkali atoms that are typically used in ultracold gases and distinguish between optical and magnetic traps .    in an _ optical trap _ , we may consider the case that the magnetic sublevels are degenerate and subject to the same trapping potential ( proportional to the intensity of a far - detuned laser beam ) .",
    "magnetic dipole transitions can then occur between hyperfine levels whose splitting is on the order of @xmath121 , corresponding to temperatures of @xmath122 ( see appendix  [ magnetic transition matrix elements ] for more details . ) in contrast , electric dipole transitions occur in the visible range @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "if we average over the magnetic sublevels , we get an isotropic magnetic polarizability .",
    "this allows to write @xmath125 , so that in eq.([eq1 ] ) or  ( [ eq : matsubara - series ] ) @xmath126 the setup we will consider in most of our examples is an atom in a _ magnetic trap_. in these traps ,",
    "one uses the interaction of a permanent magnetic dipole with an inhomogeneous , static magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a spin @xmath15 manifold : the zeeman effect then leads to a splitting of the magnetic sublevels by the larmor frequency , @xmath127 in weak fields . to give an order of magnitude , @xmath128 at @xmath129 .",
    "atoms in those magnetic sublevels where @xmath130 are weak - field seekers , and can be trapped in field minima .",
    "the magnetic trap we have in mind is a two - wire trap suspended below the surface of an atom chip .",
    "currents in the two wires , combined with a static field , create a field minimum below the chip surface , with gravity pulling the potential minimum into a position where the magnetic field is nonzero and perpendicular to the surface .",

    "the thermal dependence is much more pronounced for a normally conducting surface compared to a description without ohmic losses .",
    "the role of dc conductivity in the two - plate scenario is still an open question at nonzero temperature .",
    "the atom - surface interaction may thus provide an alternative way to investigate the temperature dependence of the casimir effect , e.g. in atom chip experiments .",
    "the main challenge is the small value of the interaction energy as compared to the electric one .",
    "future measurements of the magnetic casimir - polder interaction may involve high precision spectroscopy on the shift in hyperfine or zeeman levels . in order to separate effects of the magnetic and the electric dipole coupling it will be important to find control parameters that affect exclusively the magnetic contribution .",
    "this may include the variation in external fields , isotope shifts , and highly polarizable atomic states like rydberg atoms .",

    "the thermal free energies have then been calculated numerically in the matsubara - formalism by summing over a thermal spectral free energy density @xmath282 at discrete imaginary frequencies .",
    "now , the infinite sum is replaced by a finite one plus an integral to approximate the remaining infinite partial sum @xmath283 if the upper summation limit @xmath284 is chosen correctly , the remainder is a slowly varying function and the error is small , according to the euler - maclaurin formula . in all systems considered in this work ,",
    "the exponential in the green s function ensures this property .",

    "a fixed number of matsubara terms ( @xmath285 ) has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , that since the matsubara frequencies are linear in @xmath3 , any such scheme with a fixed number of terms breaks down at low temperatures , where the integrand @xmath286 has not sufficiently decayed . a basic criterion for @xmath284",
    "is that the partial sum is sufficiently large , so that the integral is only a small correction @xmath287 to avoid the evaluation of the integral in eq.([eq : n_numerik ] ) we have used an upper bound @xmath288 which exploits the exponential decay of @xmath243 introduced by the green s tensor .",

    "the dipole operator is @xmath296 and the quantization axis is @xmath297,so that @xmath298 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : two - level_polarizability ] ) we need only matrix elements connecting to the ground - state @xmath299 , the only nonvanishing of which yield @xmath300 transitions connecting identical states do not contribute and we obtain the result of eq . .",
    "let us now calculate the matrix elements for the @xmath301 atom prepared in a hyperfine s - state , @xmath302 the dipole operator @xmath303 , assuming vanishing orbital momentum and because of the smallness of the nuclear land g - factor @xmath304 .",
