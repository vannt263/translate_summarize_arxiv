    "the flux level of most blazars pose a challenge to the sensitivity of current iact experiments .",
    "thus relatively long exposure times are required to detect blazars in the vhe regime .",
    "in addition iacts have a small field of view compared to gev gamma - ray satellite telescopes . an all sky survey in vhe with a deep exposure",
    "is thus not technically feasible using current installations .",
    "therefore it is necessary to adopt some selection procedure to choose candidate vhe blazars to be observed with iact experiments . a commonly applied strategy to select vhe - observation candidates uses sources selected on the basis of their brightness at lower energies , viz . in the radio and x - ray regime @xcite .",
    "this method relies on the hypothesis that the radio and x - ray frequencies , which sample the synchrotron regime , are a direct proxy to estimate the brightness of the vhe component .",
    "this strategy has been quite successful .",
    "however , the physical mechanism that connects the separate spectral components is not firmly established .",
    "in addition , while applying this strategy , sources were selected from incomplete source - catalogs and were thus an incomplete sample of predicted - vhe - bright blazars .",
    "+ an alternate method proposes to select blazars based on their spectrum in the @xmath0mev - @xmath0gev band ( from now on , referred to as the gev - band ) .",
    "this regime is probed using satellite - borne @xmath1-ray - instruments such as the egret instrument which flew on board the cgro satellite , and the large area telescope ( lat ) instrument on the recently launched fgst . for most blazars",
    "it is believed that the vhe emission and the gev emission arise from the same physical mechanism and hence should be intimately related . thus selecting blazars detected in the gev - band with certain spectral characteristics , can be a useful tool in selecting candidates for vhe observations .",
    "this method was applied to the archival egret data from the 3@xmath2 egret catalog @xcite in @xcite .",
    "here we apply this strategy to the recently released gev - bright agn sample provided by the fgst team , called the lbas@xcite .",
    "+    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "the lbas , @xcite consists of @xmath3 sources which have high - confidence associations with known agns .",
    "it contains @xmath4 blazars ; of which @xmath5 are flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , @xmath6 are bl lac objects , and @xmath7 are blazars with uncertain classification , in addition to the two radio galaxies - centaurus a and ngc 1275 . in the lbas ,",
    "the integral flux between @xmath8gev and @xmath0gev and the corresponding spectral index are given for all sources , derived from a power law fit between @xmath9gev and @xmath0gev .",
    "a search on the redshift of all these sources in the available literature yielded redshift values for 92 objects . +",
    "a subset of these objects after excluding sources with @xmath10 was used as the source - sample for applying our selection strategy .",
    "sources with uncertain redshifts were excluded .",
    "the lbas spectra of the selected sample was extrapolated to vhe energies to get the estimated intrinsic vhe spectra . in the absence of additional details on individual source spectra ( e.g. any spectral - break or turn - off )",
    "such an extrapolation is a reasonable first order estimate of the vhe spectra .",
    "this estimated intrinsic vhe spectra corrected for the ebl attenuation gives the estimated observed - vhe - spectra for each source .",
    "vhe @xmath1-rays are absorbed in the inter - galactic medium via pair - production mechanism , from photon - photon scattering on the extragalactic photon field ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the optical depth ( @xmath12 ) due to this mechanism , is both a function of redshift , and the photon energies . for each object",
    "the corresponding @xmath13 is calculated using the ebl model in @xcite .",
    "the ebl limits in @xcite are derived from actual vhe observations , making certain assumptions about the intrinsic spectra and are hence a reasonable upper limit to the ebl level .",
    "the extrapolated spectra is attenuated by a factor of @xmath14 to obtain the predicted observed spectra in vhe ( see figure [ vheextrapolatiion ] ) .",
    "+    the integral flux under the extrapolated spectra , beyond @xmath15gev , i(@xmath16gev ) , gives an indication of the flux that would be seen using the current generation of iacts such as veritas , h.e.s.s . , and magic .",
    "assuming that an i(@xmath17gev ) @xmath18@xmath19 is required for a @xmath7@xmath20 detection in @xmath21hours , a list of @xmath22 candidates satisfying this condition , ranked by their i(@xmath16gev ) value is presented in table [ rankedlist ] . in the table , f@xmath23 is the lbas flux in the @xmath8gev to @xmath0gev band . @xmath24",
    "( also from lbas ) is the spectral index derived from a simple power law fit between @xmath9gev and @xmath0gev .",
    "established vhe emitting blazars are denoted with an asterisk after their common names .",
    "the fact that there are eight vhe emitters in this list of twenty predicted vhe emitters , gives credibility to this selection method .",
    "to compare these predictions with actual vhe spectra of the sources , simultaneous observation using iacts need to be compared with the lbas extrapolations that we give here .",
    "the published example of such a simultaneous observation is the joint h.e.s.s .- fermi campaign on pks 2155 - 304 between @xmath25 august @xmath26 and @xmath27 september @xmath26 , @xcite .",
    "the fgst spectra measured during the campaign is consistent with the values given in the lbas .",
    "however , the spectra in @xcite shows a break in the fermi spectra at @xmath28gev .",
    "since it is not known to us if this break is a stable feature in the gev spectra throughout the three month period used to get the lbas values , we simply take the single power - law fits from lbas .",
    "given this we expect the extrapolations to vhe regime to lie slightly above the true vhe measurements , provided the correction due to the ebl absorption was correct ( assuming that the ebl used here truly represents an upper limit ) .",
    "as we show in figure [ pks2155 - 304 ] this is indeed the case , for both the simple power law fit from the lbas , and the simple power - law fit in @xcite .",
    "+ comparing to non - simultaneous vhe datasets though not as constraining to check our estimates , still gives an indication of their compatibility .",
    "two more examples are given in figures [ bl - lac ] and [ pks2155 - 304 ] .",
    "such a comparison was done for 10 sources , and an overall good agreement was found between our extrapolations and the true - vhe measurements .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , in @xcite , extrapolations from the egret values consistently under predicted the vhe spectra .",
    "this could be due to two possible reasons .",
    "firstly most blazars are likely to show long term variability ; and secondly the lat instrument on fermi has a higher high - energy threshold , and thus is much nearer to the vhe regime than egret , thus yielding extrapolations that are much closer to the true intrinsic vhe spectra .",
    "with the data available from the fgst , it is now possible for the first time to make simultaneous measurements of the high energy component of vhe blazars , from 100 mev to tens of tev .",
    "it also opens up a window    of opportunity to discover new vhe blazars based on extrapolations from fgst measurements .",
    "a list of such candidates is provided here using the spectral measurements from the lat bright agn sample .",
    "the extrapolated spectra of these candidates are above the detection threshold of the current generation iacts , and are recommended for observations .",
    "eight of the twenty listed blazars are established vhe emitters and hence validate this strategy for selecting candidates for vhe observations ."
