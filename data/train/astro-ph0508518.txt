    "the minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model of particle physics ( mssm )  @xcite provides a promising dark matter candidate in the lightest neutralino , @xmath0 , a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak neutral gauge- and higgs bosons . assuming r - parity conservation ,",
    "the neutralino is stable . from accelerator searches and relic density constraints from wmap data ,",
    "a lower limit on the mass of the mssm neutralino can be derived  @xcite .",
    "typical lower limits for @xmath1 from such studies are about 20 gev , depending on the values chosen for tan@xmath2 . in models where the pseudo - scalar higgs boson @xmath3 is assumed to be light , @xmath4 200 gev",
    ", the neutralino mass can be as low as 6 gev .",
    "theoretical arguments based on the requirement of unitarity set an upper limit on @xmath1 of 340  tev  @xcite . within these limits , the allowed parameter space of minimal super - symmetry can be exploited to build realistic models which provide relic neutralino densities of cosmological interest to address the dark matter problem .",
    "relic neutralinos in the galactic halo can become gravitationally bound in orbits in the solar system by losing energy through elastic scattering with matter .",
    "they may finally be trapped and accumulate inside celestial bodies like the sun  @xcite , annihilate , and produce a neutrino flux from the decays of the annihilation products  @xcite .",
    "we have previously published a search for neutralino dark matter accumulated in the earth using the 10-string detector amanda - b10 and data from 1997  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we present the first search for neutralino dark matter accumulated in the sun with the extended amanda - ii detector . due to the position of the sun at the south pole , reaching no more than 23.5@xmath5 below the horizon",
    ", the separation of a potential neutralino - induced neutrino flux from the sun from the atmospheric muon flux is a challenge that we could only address because of the increased sensitivity of the amanda - ii detector to horizontal tracks .",
    "amanda - ii consists of an array of 677 optical modules deployed on 19 vertical strings at depths between 1500  m and 2000  m in the south pole ice cap .",
    "the strings are arranged in three approximately concentric circles of 60  m , 120  m and 200  m diameter respectively .",
    "an optical module consists of a photomultiplier tube housed in a glass pressure vessel .",
    "muons from charged - current neutrino interactions near the array are detected by the cherenkov light they produce when traversing the ice . during 2001",
    "the detector was triggered when at least 24 modules were hit within a time window of 2.5 @xmath6s .",
    "the trigger rate was 70  hz . the relative timing of the photons reaching the optical modules allows the reconstruction of the muon track .",
    "a more detailed description of the reconstruction techniques used in amanda is given in ref .",
    "the simulation of the neutralino - induced neutrino signal was performed using the ` darksusy ` program  @xcite for a sample of neutralino masses ( 100 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , 3000 and 5000 gev ) .",
    "neutralinos can annihilate pair - wise to , e.g. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , w@xmath9w@xmath10 , z@xmath11z@xmath11 , h@xmath12h@xmath13 , z@xmath11h@xmath12 and w@xmath14h@xmath15 , and neutrinos are produced in the decays of the annihilation products .",
    "neutrinos produced in quark jets ( from e.g.@xmath16 ) or from higgs bosons typically have lower energy than those produced from decays of @xmath17 leptons or gauge bosons .",
    "two annihilation channels were considered in this paper for each mass tested , @xmath18 and @xmath19 w@xmath9w@xmath10 , which are referred to as _ soft _ and _ hard _ , respectively , in the rest of the paper .",
    "this choice covers the range of neutrino energies which would be detectable with amanda for typical mssm models .",
    "the simulated angular range was restricted to zenith angles between 90@xmath5 ( horizontal ) and 113@xmath5 , with the generated number of events as a function of angle weighted by the time the sun spends at each declination .",
    "the neutrino - nucleon interactions in the ice around the detector producing the detectable muon flux were simulated with ` pythia `  @xcite using the ` cteq3 `  @xcite parametrization of the nucleon structure functions .    the background for this search arises from up - going atmospheric neutrinos and mis - reconstructed downward - going atmospheric muons .",
    "we have simulated the atmospheric neutrino flux according to  @xcite .",
    "the simulation includes neutrino propagation through the earth , taking into account the earth density profile , neutrino absorption and neutral current scattering .",
    "a sample of 1.9@xmath20 atmospheric neutrinos with energies between 10  gev and 10  pev and zenith angles between 70@xmath5 and 180@xmath5 ( vertically up - going ) has been simulated .",
    "the simulation of atmospheric muons was based on the ` corsika ` air shower generator  @xcite using the south pole atmosphere parameters and protons as primaries .",
    "we have simulated 1.6  @xmath21  @xmath22 interactions , distributed isotropically with zenith angles between 0@xmath5 and 85@xmath5 , and with proton energies , @xmath23 , between 600  gev and 10@xmath24  gev , assuming a differential energy distribution @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the sample corresponds to about 32.5 days of equivalent detector live - time .",
    "muons were propagated from the production point to the detector taking into account energy losses by bremsstrahlung , pair production , photo - nuclear interactions and @xmath26-ray production as implemented in the code ` mmc `  @xcite .",
    "the data set used comprises 8.7@xmath2110@xmath27 events collected in 143.7 days of effective live - time between the end of march and the end of september 2001 . the data and monte carlo events",
    "have been reconstructed with a fast first - guess track finding algorithm which is used as a seed for an iterative maximum - likelihood reconstruction .",
    "the reconstructed events were processed through a series of filters in order to reduce the atmospheric muon background and retain as much of a potential signal as possible .",
    "the variables used in the analysis are the same for the different neutralino masses , but the cuts have been optimized independently for each mass in order to exploit the differences in the resulting muon energy spectra .",
    "the event selection was optimized in a blind way , by explicitly excluding the time tag of the events ( and thus the direction of the sun ) in the development of the selection criteria ( see  @xcite for details of this analysis ) .",
    "firstly , events were selected according to the quality of the track reconstruction and their zenith angle .",
    "the quality criteria were based on direct hits , _",
    "i.e. _ hits with time residuals , @xmath28 , in the interval @xmath29 $ ] relative to the expected arrival time of an unscattered photon from the fitted track .",
    "cuts were made on the number of direct hits , the maximum distance along the track direction between two such hits and the number of strings with direct hits .",
    "this selection ( cut levels 1 to 3 in figure  [ fig : relative_effs_l5 ] ) resulted in a rejection of 99.97% of the data ( mostly downgoing muons ) , while the simulated background from atmospheric neutrinos was reduced to 30% .",
    "the simulated signal was reduced between 46% and 54% ( depending on the neutralino mass ) .",
    ".[tab : events_at_l5 ] for each neutralino mass and annihilation channel the table shows : the number of data events , n@xmath30 , the number of expected atmospheric neutrinos in the declination band of the sun , n@xmath31 , the search bin , @xmath32 , the final number of data events and the estimated background in the search bin , n@xmath33 and n@xmath34 respectively and the muon effective volume , v@xmath35 .",
    "the last three columns show the 90% cl upper limit on the expected signal , @xmath36 , and the corresponding 90% cl limits on the annihilation rate at the center of the sun and on the muon flux at the earth , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the limits include systematic uncertainties . soft and hard refer to annihilation into @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the next step consisted on a cut on a neural network ( nn ) output .",
    "for each neutralino mass , a nn was optimized for the simulated signal and a background sample consisting of simulated atmospheric muons .",
    "no information about the characteristics of atmospheric neutrinos was included in the training of the network .",
    "eight variables were used as an input to the nn to characterize the events : the number of hit channels , the difference in reconstructed angle between the fast first - guess fit and the maximum likelihood fit , the number of late ( @xmath41150 ns ) hits , the track length of the first - guess fit , the length spanned by all the hits projected onto the direction of the final reconstruction , the likelihood of the fit , the center of gravity of the hits and the vertical distance between the deepest and shallowest hit modules .",
    "the mlpfit package was used  @xcite .",
    "the network performance was optimized by varying the network architecture , the size of the training samples and minimization algorithms .",
    "an architecture of 8 - 40 - 1 with a hybrid linear minimization was found to give maximal efficiency .",
    "the final event selection consisted of the following series of cuts : the number of hit channels , the number of early hits ( @xmath42 -15 ns ) , the number of hits used in the first - guess fit and the distance between the first and last direct hits projected on the track direction . for this",
    "last cut , the direct hit definition used was -15ns @xmath4375ns .",
    "figure  [ fig : relative_effs_l5 ] shows an example of the relative efficiency for signal , background and data as a function of cut level , for one of the neutralino masses . cut level 4 corresponds to the cut on the nn output , and the last level to the addition of the cuts just described , shown individually as the intermediate points between level 4 and 5 in the plot .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta_phi ] shows the distribution of the cosine of the space angle , @xmath44 , between the reconstructed tracks and the direction of the sun ( after unblinding ) .",
    "the distribution is in agreement , both in shape and normalization , with the expectation from the atmospheric neutrino background , within the 25% overall systematics of the atmospheric neutrino flux  @xcite ( indicated by the shaded band ) .",
    "there are several systematic uncertainties in the detector effective volume that should be taken into account when calculating limits .",
    "the uncertainty in the optical module sensitivity contributes about 14% , while the detector calibration and the hardware simulation contribute about 5% .",
    "the largest contribution comes from the imprecise knowledge of the layered structure and the impurity contents of the ice , and is less than about 30% ( with the exception of the softest spectrum , annihilation of 100 gev neutralinos into @xmath39 where this uncertainty reaches about 50% ) .",
    "uncertainties on the neutrino - nucleon cross - sections and in the simulation of muon energy loss contribute of the order of 5% .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainties in the detector effective volume lie between 20% and about 60% depending on the neutralino mass model being tested ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the uncertainties have been incorporated in the limits using the method described in  @xcite with the unified feldman - cousins ordering scheme  @xcite .",
    "different angular bins around the position of the sun for each neutralino mass and annihilation channel were used in the search for a signal .",
    "the bins were chosen as containing 90% of the signal , and they range from 5.5@xmath45 for the harder neutrino spectra to 26@xmath45 for the softest spectrum ( 100 gev neutralinos annihilating into @xmath39 ) .",
    "the off - source data in the declination band of the sun were used to estimate the expected background at the sun position .",
    "this procedure eliminates any effects of uncertainties in the background simulation and in the total normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "table  [ tab : events_at_l5 ] summarizes the relevant numbers .",
    "no evidence of a statistically significant excess of events from the direction of the sun was found .",
    "therefore , the number of observed events from that direction , together with the poisson mean of the background expectation , were used to set limits on the neutrino flux at the earth from neutralino annihilations in the sun .",
    "we have followed the same prescription as in  @xcite , starting from the directly measurable quantity , the neutrino - to - muon conversion rate , @xmath46 , where @xmath36 is the 90% cl signal upper limit , @xmath47 is the live - time , @xmath48 the reconstruction efficiency and @xmath49 the effective volume of the detector at final cut level .",
    "the limit on the annihilation rate of neutralinos in the sun , @xmath37 , is proportional to @xmath50 , where the proportionality coefficient takes into account the production of muons through the neutrino - nucleon cross - section weighted by the different branching ratios of the @xmath51 annihilation process and the corresponding neutrino energy spectra .",
    "from @xmath37 we reach the limit on the muon flux at the earth by taking into account that @xmath52 where d@xmath53 is the distance to the sun and @xmath54 is the muon flux produced from the neutralino annihilations , including all mssm model dependencies and interaction kinematics .",
    "@xmath55 is here an arbitrary threshold , that can be used to convert the measured flux limit ( which is obtained for the actual detector energy threshold ) to any other threshold .",
    "the last three columns of table  [ tab : events_at_l5 ] show the feldman - cousins 90% upper limit on the expected signal and the corresponding 90% cl limits on the annihilation rate at the center of the sun and on the muon flux at the earth .",
    "all  numbers  include  systematic  uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : limits ] shows the amanda limits on the muon flux at the earth from neutralino annihilations into @xmath40 ( hard channel ) in the sun as a function of neutralino mass , compared to the results of baksan  @xcite , macro  @xcite and super - k  @xcite and theoretical predictions based on ` darksusy ` .",
    "the limits have been rescaled to a common muon threshold of 1  gev using the known energy spectrum of the neutralinos .",
    "the sparseness of the arrangement of the amanda strings ( not less than 25 m between nearest neighbours ) makes the detector less effective at lower neutrino energies , and leads to a worsening of the limit for neutralino masses below about 500 gev . above this mass , amanda , with the 144 days of live - time used for the present analysis , is already competitive with experiments with much longer exposure times ( 3.6 years of collected data for macro and 4.6 years for super - k for example ) .",
    "the symbols in the figure represent the predictions of ` darksusy ` for given combinations of susy parameters .",
    "the models shown are only those which give a relic density within the current limits of allowed dark matter density in the universe , 0.05@xmath56 0.2 .",
    "the dots represent parameter combinations that are disfavored by the latest results from direct experiments setting limits on the neutralino - nucleon cross - section  @xcite .",
    "although comparison between direct and indirect searches is not straightforward , the figure shows that current results from indirect searches are competitive in the high neutralino mass region .",
    "neutrino oscillations in the atmosphere ( not included in the simulations ) would tend to reduce the muon - neutrino flux and affect the total normalization of the background .",
    "since we have used the measured neutrino flux off - source as an estimation of the background at the source position , the effect of oscillations is inherently included in the analysis .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino simulations were used as a confirmation that the analysis cuts selected atmospheric neutrinos and rejected the down - going atmospheric muons to the desired level before the unblinding of the data set .",
    "the ` darksusy ` simulations did not include oscillations of the neutrinos on their way to the earth .",
    "the effect of oscillations of neutrinos produced in the sun on the final flux observed at the earth has been discussed in  @xcite ( and in  @xcite in a slightly different context ) .",
    "detailed calculations in  @xcite found that the resulting muon flux at the earth from low mass ( @xmath57 ) mssm neutralino annihilations can be considerably affected by @xmath58 oscillations in some scenarios .",
    "this is the case for mssm models with important annihilation branching ratios into @xmath59 , typically @xmath60 . in such cases the muon flux at the earth",
    "can be increased by a factor of about 2 to 4 with respect to the no - oscillation case . for higher neutralino masses , where the main annihilation channel can be through gauge bosons or heavy quarks ,",
    "the effect of @xmath58 oscillations is negligible , oscillations into @xmath61 being compensated by @xmath61 oscillating into @xmath62 .",
    "flavor mixing with @xmath63 both from @xmath62 and @xmath61 is suppressed by the small value of @xmath64 and the mixing angle @xmath65 respectively , and does not play a role when considering the @xmath62 flux from the sun . given the considerations above , the flux and annihilation rate limits presented in this letter for the case of annihilations into @xmath40 would be practically unaffected if one were to consider oscillations .",
    "the results for the @xmath39 annihilation channel would also be unaffected for high neutralino masses ( @xmath66 gev ) and would worsen by a few percent for neutralino masses below @xmath67 gev .",
