    "it is well known that string theory is a promising candidate for the unified theory .",
    "the extra dimension is one of the most important predictions in the string theory .",
    "therefore , the detection of the extra dimension has attracted a lot of attention recently because it can present the signature of the string and the correctness of string theory .",
    "recent investigations indicate that the extra dimension can imprint in the quasinormal modes originated from the perturbation around high dimensional black holes @xcite , which could be tested in the gravitational wave probe in the near future .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of hawking radiation from the high dimensional black holes could provide another possible way to observe the extra dimension , which is expected to be detected in particle accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "the strong gravitational lensing is another possible way to detect the extra dimension . according to general relativity , photons",
    "would be deviated from their straight paths as they pass close to a compact and massive body .",
    "the phenomena resulting from the deflection of light rays in a gravitational field are called gravitational lensing and the object causing a detectable deflection is usually named a gravitational lens .",
    "the strong gravitational lensing is caused by a compact object with a photon sphere , such as a black hole , black brane , and so on .",
    "as photons pass close to the photon sphere , the deflection angles become so large that an observer would detect two infinite sets of faint relativistic images on each side of the black hole which are produced by photons that make complete loops around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "these relativistic images can provide us not only information about black holes in the universe , but also profound verification of alternative theories of gravity in their strong field regime @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the strong gravitational lensing by high dimensional black holes can help us to detect the extra dimension in astronomical observation in the future .",
    "the kaluza - klein black holes with squashed horizons are a kind of interesting kaluza - klein type metrics @xcite . in the vicinity of the black hole horizon , the spacetime has a structure of the five - dimensional black holes . in the region",
    "far from the black holes , it is locally the direct product of the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime and the circle .",
    "recently , the hawking radiations have been studied in these squashed kaluza - klein black holes , which indicates that the luminosity of hawking radiation can tell us the size of the extra dimension which opens a window to observe extra dimensions @xcite . moreover ,",
    "quasinormal modes in the background of the kaluza - klein black hole with squashed horizons have been investigated in @xcite , which implies that the quasinormal frequencies contain the information of the size of the extra dimension .",

    "et al.__@xcite have studied the precession of a gyroscope in a circular orbit in the squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime and find that the correction is proportional to the square of ( size of extra dimension)/(gravitational radius of central object ) .",
    "these results are very useful for us to understand the properties of the squashed kaluza - klein black holes and to extract information about the extra dimension in future observations .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the gravity lens in the strong field limit in the squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime and see that effect of the size of the extra dimension on the coefficients and observables of gravitational lensing in the strong field limit .",

    "we suppose that the gravitational field of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy can be described by this metric and then obtain the numerical results for the observational gravitational lensing parameters defined in sec.ii .",
    "then , we make a comparison between the properties of gravitational lensing in the squashed kaluza - klein and four - dimensional schwarzschild metrics . to conclude , we present a summary .",

    "it is found that in such a squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( the four - dimensional gravitational constant ) can be expressed as @xmath12 @xcite .",
