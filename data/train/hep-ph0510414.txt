    "diana uses qgraf @xcite as diagram generator . by now there exist several qgraf versions which , however , have incompatible syntax of their input files . in most cases",
    "the user does not need or does not want to know which version of qgraf is in use .",
    "diana takes care of this .",
    "it automatically investigates which version of qgraf is implemented . starting from version 2.37 it also provides the user with information about the version used for the diagram generation . at present , all qgraf versions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are supported . from the diana point of view",
    "there is no difference between them ; the differences concern only syntax .",
    "qgraf can not generate two - line vertices .",
    "this causes problems when diana is requested to introduce counterterms . in this case",
    "it produces three - line vertices but does not show one of them , i.e. in this case diana skips the image of the `` spurious '' line in the diagram .",
    "another new feature is introduced to suppress labels . in version 2.35 of diana and later ones",
    "these options ( changing the model extensions @xcite ) are taken into account in terms of `` optional extensions '' in the propagators of the model file , e.g. in    .... [ le , le;l ; ff(num , fnum , vec , mle)*i _ ;                   mmle ; nothing,0,0 ; ] ....    the last two extensions ` ; nothing,0,0 ; ] ` ( separated by ;) have the following meaning : + 1 .",
    "the new line type of the propagator `` nothing '' means that this line will not be drawn .",
    "the two following parameters in general stand for line characterizations and must be included in any case .",
    "the second `` extension '' apparently is empty , which means that no label will be drawn - in previous versions this meant the `` default image '' ( in the above example : ` le ` )",
    "again , starting from version 2.25 , momenta can be introduced automatically .",
    "there are several different approaches @xcite .    as `` standard '' way of attributing momenta",
    ", we consider the possibility to calculate , e.g. , from external momenta the so called `` chords '' , characterizing the virtual lines apart from the integration momenta .",
    "a more specific problem is the following : occasionally topologies have to be generated from more complicated ones by scratching lines and one may want to stick to the momenta introduced for the lines which are kept .",
    "this option was described in @xcite .",
    "a new and more difficult situation occurs when the user wants to `` scratch '' some external lines .",
    "consider e.g. the anomalous magnetic moment ; this is a 3-point function of the type fermion ",
    "fermion with an external photon of zero momentum .",
    "performing a necessary differentiation and putting the photon momentum to zero , the resulting graph appears to be a 2-point function with higher powers of scalar propagators . in this case",
    "we need to map the momenta of the 3-point function to the corresponding momenta of a 2-point function , putting one external momentum to zero .                to perform the differentiation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath5 we formally consider at first a diagram with the only nonvanishing momentum @xmath5 , all others zero . in a form program",
    "the differentiation is then performed w.r.t . @xmath5 and",
    "after that for zero momentum @xmath5 , momenta fitting to the three - point function are introduced , see fig.[fig2 ] .    in a first step",
    "we generate the form input with momenta as in fig.[fig2]a ) .",
    "after differentiation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath5 , we look ( e.g. in another program like mincer @xcite ) for the corresponding two - point topology ( fig.[fig2]b ) , add for technical reasons all momenta from the two - point topology [ fig2]b ) to the current three - point topology [ fig2]a ) , put @xmath6 and generate the form input for further evaluation .",
    "the main problem here is to determine which two - point topology corresponds to the current three - point topology . in diana topologies",
    "are represented @xcite in terms of ordered pairs of numbers like ( fromvertex , tovertex ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it tries to find an amputated topology for the diagram under consideration ( e.g. [ fig2]a , taking off @xmath5 ) in the table `` tablename '' ( e.g. from mincer ) and returns this topology ( e.g. [ fig2]b ) .",
    "it adds all momenta from the table topology to momenta of the current ( [ fig2]a ) topology and saves the resulting momenta to the local variable ` < varname>_m ` .            * ` < varname>_e ` - external lines of original ` < - > ` external lines of amputated ; * ` < varname>_ie ` internal lines of original ` < - > ` internal lines of amputated ; * ` < varname>_i ` internal lines of original ` < - > ` external lines of amputated .",
