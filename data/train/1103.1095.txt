    "during the past years the progress in experiment in the study of hadron spectroscopy has brought a lot of surprises . in the charmonium sector , a number of new resonance - like signals have been observed by the b - factories  @xcite .",
    "these observations have not only initiated tremendous interests in their nature , but also revived the efforts on the search for exotics in both experiment and theory ( e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on these issues .",
    "although various theoretical prescriptions have been proposed in order to understand the underlying dynamics for the production and decay of these new  resonances \" , such as hybrid charmonium , tetraquark , baryonium , and hadronic molecule , an interesting feature with those observed resonance - like signals is that most of them are close to open charmed meson production thresholds .",
    "an example is the @xmath12 which is located in the vicinity of @xmath13 . because of this",
    ", a molecular prescription has been broadly investigated in the literature .",
    "an alternative view is its indication of the underlying non - perturbative mechanisms arising from open charm thresholds .",
    "phenomenologically , the open channel effects may have more general dynamical implications",
    ". they would allow different partial waves to contribute in exclusive processes .",
    "in contrast , the hadronic molecule scenario would require a relative @xmath14 wave between the interacting hadrons .",
    "on the other hand , an additional @xmath15 pair creation near the open channel is highly non - perturbative .",
    "therefore , this non - perturbative mechanism would play an important role near the open heavy - flavor threshold to shift the hadrons masses nearby , and change their wavefunctions and decay properties .",
    "it is realized that a better understanding of the open channel effects would be a prerequisite for our ultimate understanding of the hadron spectroscopies .    in this work",
    "we shall use an effective lagrangian approach based on the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry  @xcite to study the open charm effects in @xmath16 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our motivation is based on the following points : i ) in @xmath11 , it is observed by belle collaboration  @xcite that an enhancement around 3.9 gev , i.e. @xmath10 , of which the nature is unclear .",
    "as we know , the vector charmonium ( @xmath17 ) spectrum has been better established since the charmonium states can be directly produced via the time - like virtual photon in @xmath18 annihilations .",
    "therefore , the observation of the enhancement @xmath10 provides an ideal place to investigate the underlying dynamics beyond the known charmonium spectrum .",
    "ii ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3 open charm effects are investigated and seem to provide a natural explanation for the @xmath10 enhancement without introducing any exotic components . in order to confirm the nature of the @xmath10 , one should investigate other possible reflections of such a mechanism .",
    "iii ) note that the position of the @xmath10 is located between the known @xmath5 and @xmath6 , its coupling to @xmath19 and isospin - violating @xmath1 would receive relatively small interferences from the nearby resonances .",
    "apart from this anticipation , we also consider the @xmath2 channel , of which the threshold is very close to the @xmath3 therefore , peculiar threshold effects due to the open @xmath3 might be detectable in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "although the experimental measurement of these three exclusive channels are not available , the cleo collaboration recently provide an upper limit of the cross sections for @xmath20 and @xmath1  @xcite , which would be a guidance for us to examine the open charm effects in the vector charmonium excitations .    this paper is organized as below . in sec .",
    "ii we present the effective lagrangian approach with formulae .",
    "the parameters are fitted in sec .",
    "section iv is devoted to numerical results and discussions .",
    "the summary is given in the last section .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach has been successfully applied to various charmonium decay processes as one of the most important non - perturbative mechanisms in order to explain some of the long - standing puzzles in the charmonium energy region .",
    "for instance , it was shown that the open charm coupled - channel effects would lead to sizeable non-@xmath21 decay branching ratios for @xmath5  @xcite , and account for the large breaking of the helicity selection rule in charmonium decays  @xcite .    as we know from the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , light vector meson contributions to the cross sections are negligible in the charmonium energy region .",
    "the main contributions included here are from vector charmonium excitations .",
    "note that the final states @xmath22 consist of a charmonium plus a light meson .",
    "therefore , the transitions are okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule violating processes , which should be dominated by soft mechanisms near threshold .",
    "since the pure electromagnetic ( em ) transitions are negligibly small , a natural way to recognize the soft mechanisms for @xmath23 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is via the open charm transitions which are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "similar approach has been applied to the study of the cross section lineshape of @xmath24 in the vicinity of the @xmath25 meson mass region  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangians for the coupling vertices involving charmonia and charmed mesons are extracted from heavy quark effective theory and chiral symmetry as applied in ref .",
    "they are written as follows : @xmath26 + h.c.,\\ ] ] where the @xmath14-wave charmonium states are expressed as @xmath27 and the charmed and anti - charmed meson triplet are @xmath28 , \\\\ h_{2i}&= & [ \\bar{\\mathcal{d}}_i^{*\\mu } \\gamma_\\mu -\\bar{\\mathcal{d}}_i\\gamma_5]\\left ( \\frac{1- \\rlap{/}{v } } { 2 } \\right ) , \\label{eq : superfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the pseudoscalar charmed mesons ( @xmath31 ) and vector charmed mesons ( @xmath32 ) , respectively .",
    "additionally , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath30 and @xmath29 , can be considered as doublet states based on the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian describing the interactions between light meson and charmed mesons reads @xmath35+igtr[h_i\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5a^\\mu_{ij}\\bar{h}_j]+i\\beta tr[h_iv^\\mu(v_\\mu-\\rho_\\mu)_{ij}\\bar{h}_j]+i\\lambda tr[h_i\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu}(\\rho)_{ij}\\bar{h}_j ] , \\label{vph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 $ ] .",

    "( [ eq : superfield ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ vph ] ) , it is easy to obtain the detailed form of the interactions to the leading order  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the levi - civita tensor and @xmath46 meson field destroys a @xmath46 meson .",
    "the kinematics for a typical transition of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are defined as : @xmath47\\to j/\\psi(k)\\eta(q ) \\ ( j/\\psi(k)\\pi^0(q ) , \\",
    "\\phi(k)\\eta_c(q))$ ] , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , the four - vector momenta of the corresponding particles , respectively .",
    "consequently , the transition amplitude for an intermediate vector charmonium @xmath52 can be expressed as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 could be a complex number serving as a vertex function for the intermediate @xmath52 coupling to final state @xmath22 via @xmath46 meson loops . for the processes of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , @xmath54 has the following expressions : @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". as we know , the meson loop integrals have ultra - violet divergence .",
    "to cut off the unphysical contributions in the high momentum transfers , we introduce a form factor as broadly applied in the literature . a typical dipole form factor for the integrals",
    "is as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cutoff energy and can be parameterized as @xmath61 with @xmath62 the mass of the exchanged particle and @xmath63 mev .    in this study , we include five resonances , i.e. @xmath33 , @xmath64 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the total transition amplitude can be expressed as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath25 are the relative phase angles which can be determined by experimental data .    in eq .",
    "( [ amp - tot ] ) , the dimensionless vector charmonia couplings to the virtual photon , @xmath69 , can be determined by the vmd model in @xmath70 : @xmath71^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the vector meson partial decay width to @xmath18 , and @xmath73 is the three - vector momentum of the final state electron in the vector meson rest frame . with the partial decay widths from the particle data group  @xcite ,",
    "the couplings @xmath74 for those low - lying charmonia are listed in table  [ tab-1 ] .    .the @xmath75 coupling constant @xmath74 determined by experimental data for @xmath76  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in terms of the c.m .",

    "[ fig:2 ] . ]",
    "in summary , we have proposed to study the coupled channel effects in @xmath80 annihilating to @xmath19 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in particular , we show that the reaction @xmath81 will be extremely interesting for disentangling the resonance contributions and open charm effects taking the advantage that the open @xmath82 threshold is relatively isolated from the nearby known charmonia @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "although we also find that the predicted cross sections are rather sensitive to the model parameters adopted , we clarify that the open charm effects from the @xmath3 channel are rather model - independent .",
    "therefore , it is extremely interesting to search for the predicted enhancement around 3.876 gev ( i.e. @xmath10 ) in experiment .",
    "confirmation of this prediction would allow us to learn a lot about the nature of non - pqcd in the charmonium energy region .",
