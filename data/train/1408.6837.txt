    "the concept of typicality @xcite states that a single pure state can have the same properties as the full statistical ensemble .",
    "this concept is not restricted to specific states and applies to the overwhelming majority of all possible states , drawn at random from a high - dimensional hilbert space . in the cleanest realization",
    ", even a single eigenstate of the hamiltonian may feature the properties of the full equilibrium density matrix , assumed in the well - known eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the notion of property is manifold in this context and also refers to the expectation values of observables . remarkably , typicality is not only a static concept and includes the dynamics of expectation values @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become clear that typicality even provides the basis for powerful numerical approaches to the dynamics of quantum many - particle systems at nonzero temperatures @xcite .",
    "these approaches are in the center of this paper .",
    "understanding relaxation and transport dynamics in quantum many - body systems is certainly one of the most desired and ambitious aims of condensed - matter physics and experiencing an upsurge of interest in recent years , both experimentally and theoretically . on the one hand ,",
    "the advent of ultracold atomic gases raises challenging questions about the equilibration and thermalization in isolated many - particle systems @xcite , including the existence , origin , or speed of relaxation processes in the absence of any external bath . on the other hand ,",
    "future information technologies such as spintronics call for a deeper insight into transport dynamics of quantum degrees of freedom such as spin excitations . spin transport in conventional nano - systems @xcite is inevitably linked to the dynamics of itinerant charge carriers .",
    "in contrast , mott - insulating quantum magnets allow for pure spin currents and thus open new perspectives in quantum transport . in the past decade ,",
    "magnetic transport in one - dimensional quantum magnets has attracted considerable attention because of the discovery of very large magnetic heat - conduction @xcite and long nuclear magnetic relaxation times @xcite .",
    "genuine spin transport , however , still remains to be observed in experiments and particularly its classification in terms of ballistic or diffusive propagation is an issue of ongoing experimental research @xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of transport in low - dimensional quantum magnets has a long and fertile history . amongst all questions ,",
    "the dissipation of currents is a key issue and has been investigated extensively at zero momentum and frequency in connection with the linear - response drude weight @xcite .",
    "the drude weight is the nondissipating part of the current autocorrelation function and , if existent , indicates a ballistic channel close to equilibrium .",
    "while in generic nonintegrable systems it is commonly expected that drude weights do not exist in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , the picture is different and more complicated in integrable systems : since an overlap of currents with the macroscopic number of conserved quantities is probable , drude weights are expected to exist . but",
    "this overlap is not necessarily finite for all model parameters and drude weights can vanish in the thermodynamic limit . in this context",
    ", an important example is the antiferromagnetic and anisotropic heisenberg ( xxz ) spin-@xmath0 chain .",
    "this chain is studied in the present paper .",
    "it is a fundamental model for the magnetic properties of interacting electrons in low dimensions .",
    "it is not only relevant to the physics of one - dimensional quantum magnets @xcite but also to physical questions in a much broader context @xcite .    in the xxz spin-@xmath0 chain ,",
    "the heat current is strictly conserved for all values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath2 @xcite and energy flows through a ballistic channel only .",
    "this type of flow is at the heart of the colossal heat conduction observed experimentally in almost ideal material realizations of the model @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the spin current is not strictly conserved and the existence of a spin drude weight is a demanding problem , resolved only partially despite much effort . at zero temperature ,",
    "@xmath3 , early work @xcite showed that the spin drude weight is nonzero in the gapless regime @xmath4 ( metal ) but zero in the gapped regime @xmath5 ( insulator ) .",
    "bethe - ansatz solutions @xcite support a qualitatively similar picture at nonzero temperatures , @xmath6 , but with a disagreement at the isotropic point @xmath7 .",
    "recent progress in combining quasi - local conservation laws and mazur s inequality has lead to a rigorous lower bound to the spin drude weight in the limit of high temperatures @xcite .",
    "this bound is very close to the bethe - ansatz solution but still allows for a vanishing drude weight at @xmath7 .",
    "numerically , a large variety of sophisticated methods has been applied to transport and relaxation dynamics in the anisotropic heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain , including full exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite , @xmath6 lanczos methods @xcite , quantum monte - carlo techniques @xcite , as well as time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) approaches to the real - time dynamics of wave packets or correlators @xcite and to the solution of the lindblad quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming majority of results for the spin drude weight , however , is only available from ed and tdmrg .",
    "since ed is at present restricted to chains of length @xmath8 , the long - time / low - frequency limit is still governed by finite - size effects and intricate extrapolation schemes to the thermodynamic limit have been invoked , with different results depending on details .",
    "such details are using even or odd @xmath9 @xcite and choosing grand - canonical and canonical ensembles @xcite . clearly , these details should be irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "alternatively , tdmrg is exceedingly more powerful w.r.t .",
    "system size and chains of length @xmath10 are accessible .",
    "but still the method is confined to a maximum time scale depending on the exchange anisotropy @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "even though there is an ongoing progress to increase this time scale , it is at present too short for a reliable extraction of the spin drude weight at the isotropic point @xmath7 @xcite , which is both , experimentally relevant and theoretically most challenging . in this situation",
    ", typicality can provide a fresh numerical perspective @xcite .",
    "much less is known on transport dynamics apart from the mere existence of drude weights . for spin transport at @xmath7 , steady - state bath scenarios @xcite and classical simulations @xcite suggest super - diffusive dynamics in the limit of high temperatures , while bosonization predicts diffusion at low but nonzero temperatures @xcite . at @xmath5 , signatures of diffusion have been observed also at high temperatures in different approaches @xcite ( see ref .   for a discussion of the limit @xmath11 ) .",
    "diffusion of heat , however , necessarily requires integrability - breaking perturbations . for nonintegrable problems ,",
    "perturbation theory is the only analytical technique available but hard to perform in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the perturbative regime of small integrability - breaking is further challenging for numerical methods since dynamics is slow and physically relevant time scales are long .",
    "these long time scales are a challenge for tdmrg and , due to finite - size effects , also for ed .",
    "thus , typicality may complement both numerical methods in this demanding regime .    in this paper",
    ", we use the concept of typicality to study the real - time dynamics of spin and energy currents in integrable and nonintegrable spin-@xmath0 chains at nonzero temperatures . in this way",
    ", we extend our previous work in ref . to energy transport and",
    "nonintegrable systems as well . within the framework of linear response theory ,",
    "we numerically obtain autocorrelation functions from the propagation of a single pure state , drawn at random as a typical representative of the full statistical ensemble . by comparing to small - system data from ed and existing short - time data from tdmrg ,",
    "we show that typicality is satisfied in finite systems down to low temperatures and holds in both , integrable and nonintegrable systems .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate two numerical advantages of typicality : first , for integrable systems , we can calculate the long - time dynamics and extract the drude weight for large systems outside the range of ed .",
    "thus , typicality improves the reliability of finite - size scaling .",
    "second , for nonintegrable systems , we can obtain the full relaxation curve for large systems with little finite - size effects on the physically relevant time scale .",
    "hence , typicality provides also the basis for determining the dc conductivity in the regime of small integrability - breaking model parameters without using any fits / extrapolations .",
    "both advantages yield significant progress in the numerical investigation of spin and energy dynamics in particular and of other observables in a much broader context .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ models ] we first introduce the two models studied , namely , the integrable xxz spin-@xmath0 chain and a nonintegrable version due to the presence of a staggered magnetic field oriented in @xmath1 direction . in this sec .",
    "we also define the spin and energy currents , as well as their time - dependent autocorrelation functions , and we discuss symmetries . the next sec .",
    "[ typicality ] is devoted to the concept of dynamical typicality and the closely related numerical technique used throughout this paper .",
    "then we turn to our results : in sec.[integrable ] we focus on spin - current dynamics in the integrable model and study the spin drude weight as a function of anisotropy and temperature . in the following sec .",
    "[ nonintegrable ] we extend our study in two directions : the nonintegrable model and the dynamics of the energy current . in this sec .",

    "[ summary ] closes with a summary and draws conclusions .",
    "in this paper we investigate the antiferromagnetic xxz spin-@xmath0 chain .",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions and write the well - known hamiltonian ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 as a sum over the local energy @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the components of spin-@xmath0 operators at site @xmath17 and @xmath9 is the total number of sites .",

    "a homogenous magnetic field , for instance , yields a magnetothermal correction to the energy current @xcite . such a correction does not occur in our case .",

    "moreover , choosing @xmath52 as perturbation allows us to compare with existing results in the literature .      within the framework of linear response theory @xcite , we investigate spin and energy autocorrelation functions at inverse temperatures @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 where the time argument of the operator @xmath60 has to be understood w.r.t .  the heisenberg picture , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the partition function .",
