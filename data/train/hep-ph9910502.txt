    "in nuclear physics one is often faced by problems that require nonperturbative methods .",
    "the best known example is the problem of bound states . even if the underlying theory may have a small coupling constant ( such as in qed ) , and therefore allows the use of perturbation theory in general , the treatment of bound states are inherently nonperturbative .",
    "the n - body bound state is defined by the pole of the interacting n - body propagator .",
    "a perturbative approximation of n - body propagator does not produce the bound state pole location .",
    "therefore it is essential that reliable nonperturbative methods that take all orders of interaction into account are developed .",
    "for this reason , numerous nonperturbative methods have been developed and successfully used in the literature .",
    "some of the best known examples are lattice gauge theory  @xcite ( lgt ) , and relativistic bound state equations  @xcite .    in a recent paper  @xcite",
    "we ( along with authors j. tjon , and f. gross ) have discussed yet another method known as the feynman - schwinger representation(fsr ) . the basic idea in the fsr approach  @xcite",
    "is to integrate out all fields at the expense of introducing quantum mechanical path integrals over the _ trajectories of particles_. replacing the path integrals over fields with path integrals over trajectories has an enormous computational advantage .",
    "the advantage is due to the fact that the path integration over trajectories involves a variation of _ lines _ rather than _ fields in a volume_. therefore the degrees of freedom is considerably fewer .",
    "the fsr approach differs from the lgt in that it utilizes a space - time continuum , therefore maintaining the poincare symmetry . on the other hand",
    "it should be pointed out that the fsr approach is not without its drawbacks . in particular , how to extend the fsr approach to include fermions is not known . in the past researchers  @xcite have attacked the fermion problem using various approximations .",
    "an _ exact _",
    "result involving fermions is an important problem and requires further study .",
    "while being able to calculate a nonperturbative result by itself is interesting , an additional motivation in studying the fsr approach is to determine which subsets of diagrams give the dominant contribution to the n - body propagator .",
    "this is particularly important in determining what kind of approximations are reasonable within the context of bound state equations .",
    "an example of how the fsr results can be used to compare different nonperturbative approximation schemes was presented in refs  @xcite . in those works the emphasis was on the development of the formalism and application to the 1 and 2-body propagators . in ref",
    "@xcite , the fsr prediction for the 1-body mass in scalar qed was compared by the rainbow - dyson - schwinger equation prediction .",
    "it was found  @xcite that while the fsr approach provides a real mass pole for all coupling strengths , the dyson - schwinger equation provides a complex mass pole beyond a critical coupling strength .",
    "furthermore it was found that , for scalar qed in 0 + 1 dimension , the vertex corrections to the exchange interaction do not contribute to the 2-body binding energy  @xcite .",
    "these examples demonstrate the potential usefulness of the fsr approach .",
    "the knowledge about the nonperturbative propagators and vertices provided by the fsr is valuable as an input in testing and improving the modeling of other nonperturbative approaches such as dyson - schwinger equations .  @xcite    the two and three - body bound state sectors provide possibilities for the application of the fsr formalism . in particular",
    "it is important to see how various bound state equations ( such as bethe - salpeter , gross ( spectator ) , blankenbekler - sugar , equal - time , and nonrelativistic ) compare with the quenched fsr results .",
    "applications of the fsr approach to 2 and 3 body states with comparisons to various bound state equation results in @xmath0 theory is currently under study and will be presented in a separate article .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present a complete numerical algorithm for the evaluation of @xmath5-body masses ( @xmath6 ) and distribution probabilities for scalar @xmath0 interaction in 3 + 1 dimensions . by providing this algorithm",
    "we intend to facilitate the comparison of various nonperturbative methods with the exact quenched results in @xmath0 theory .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the next section we present a brief summary of the fsr formalism . in the third section , using various 1 , 2 , and 3-body cases as examples , we discuss how results are obtained . and in the fourth section we explain the components of the program .",

    "[ kernel.phi3 ] while we present expressions for the 2-body case , generalization to an arbitrary n - body system is trivial .",
    "the bound state spectrum can be determined from the spectral decomposition of the two body green s function g(t)=_n=0^c_ne^-m_nt , where t is defined as the average time between the initial and final states t(y_4+|y_4-x_4-|x_4 ) .",

    "the spectrum of the particle involves the mass pole and a cut beyond this pole representing the continuum contribution . assuming that the constituents of the bound state are restricted to be at equal times in the initial and final states",

    "while an integration over @xmath21 is not necessary for the elimination of the continuum contribution , it is useful in eliminating the contribution of states with nonzero orbital angular momentum .    while the result for the green s function eq .",
    "[ g1.phi3 ] is exact in the quenched approximation , due to its oscillatory behavior it is not appropriate for monte - carlo simulation . in ref .",

    "( [ g1.phi3 ] ) can be shown , by using the saddle point method , to come from s = is_0=i .",
    "since the large @xmath25 values do not contribute to the integral even without the interaction term , it is a good approximation to suppress the @xmath27 term at large s values .",
    "while this suppression is done it is important that the integrand is not modified in the region of dominant contribution @xmath28 .",
    "this can be achieved by scaling the @xmath25 variable , _ in the interaction term only _ , by @xmath29 where @xmath30 in the free case , @xmath31 , the width @xmath32 of the region of dominant @xmath25 contribution goes as w=. [ width ] therefore , in the free case the dominant contribution to the @xmath25 integral comes from @xmath33 .",
    "this claim is supported by the monte - carlo simulation results . in fig .",

    "the ultraviolet singularity in the interaction is of the type dz z ( z , ) . at short distances the kernel @xmath47 goes as @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the self energy calculation involves a logarithmic type singularity .",
    "the pauli - villars regularization takes care of this singularity .",
    "the pauli - villars regularization is particularly convenient for monte - carlo simulations since it only involves a modification of the kernel . in order to achieve an efficient convergence in numerical simulations we use",

    "the value of @xmath46 can be increased arbitrarily at the cost additional computational time .",
    "it should be noted that while we employ a pauli - villars regularization throughout this paper , in general , the bound state problem _ without _ self energies _ does not _ have any uv singularities .",
    "uv singularities are only associated with the self energies of the particles .",
    "after this brief summary of the formalism , in the next section we present some of the results and discuss the details of the algorithm .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation starts by choosing an initial configuration for the trajectories of the particles .",
    "the choice of the initial trajectory is arbitrary ( except at the end points ) . in fig .",
    "[ termalize ] the evolution of the action as a function of number of updates for two different initial conditions is displayed .",
    "starting with a random initial trajectory is analogous to a high temperature system and the termalization ( reaching to the ground state ) takes a long time ( about 1000 updates ) .",
    "however if one starts by a classical free trajectory , the initial configuration is analogous to a frozen system without any fluctuations and the termalization results in an increase of the action .",
    "however asymptotically both results should converge as shown in fig .",
    "[ termalize ] .",
    "we usually start with an orderly system and disregard the first 1000 updates .",
    "step sizes of the random walker in configuration space and in s - space should be chosen such that the average acceptance rate of monte - carlo updates are about % 50 . in each run",
    "we typically make 500000 updates of trajectories . in order to reduce the statistical errors",
    "runs must be repeated ( usually more then 10 times ) using different random number seeds .",
    "the correlation function @xmath50 of sampled configurations in each run is defined as x(n ) , where @xmath51 is the mass measurement at the @xmath52th update .",

    "[ correlation ] we show the correlation function for the 1-body problem . according to fig .",
    "[ correlation ] the number of updates necessary for the correlation between sampled trajectories to vanish is around @xmath53 .",
    "the number of configurations sampled in our simulations , which is around 500000 , is well above the correlation length 1000 , thereby insuring that uncorrelated trajectories are sampled during the monte - carlo integration .",
    "the time @xmath18 required to reach to the asymptotic limit increases as @xmath27 increases . for @xmath54 the asymptotic value of the mass , given by eq .",
    "( [ groundstate ] ) , is obtained around @xmath55 . in particular for the result shown in fig .",
    "[ mvsg2.1b ] , as @xmath27 ranged from @xmath56 gev@xmath42 to @xmath41 gev@xmath42 the asymptotic time values used were increased from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . as time @xmath18 is increased the number of steps @xmath59 should also be proportionally increased so that the step size of the particle trajectory remains the same .",
    "as one increases the coupling strength @xmath27 , trajectories of the particles deviate from the classical trajectory to a greater degree .",
    "this increase in fluctuations requires that one uses a higher @xmath59 value . the number of steps @xmath59 particles take between the initial and final coordinates is typically chosen to be @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ mvsg2.1b ] the @xmath27 dependence of the one - body dressed mass is presented .",
    "1-body masses presented here are lower than those in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that in that work @xmath40 was assumed to be approximately 1 .",
    "however it was subsequently realized that @xmath40 deviates from 1 significantly ( see fig .",
    "[ speak ] ) as coupling strength is increased , and a self consistent determination of @xmath40 is important to pin down the critical point . according to fig .",

    "while the algorithm provided is capable to take into account all self energy and vertex dressing corrections to the bound state , in the bound state applications provided here the self energy contributions of particles were not taken into account .",

    "are stored in histograms . in general for an n - body bound state there are @xmath63 relative distances .",
    "since the particles are assumed to have equal time coordinates in the final state , essentially the relative distance is equal to the spatial distance .",

    "the choice of range is arbitrary as long as a reasonably smooth histogram is produced .",
    "the number of bins in each histogram is chosen to be 100 .",

    "[ rdist.surf.2b ] , shows the result for @xmath54 gev@xmath42 .",

    "<S> a knowledge of nonpertubative propagators is often needed when the standard perturbative methods are not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this is the bound state problem in field theory . while a nonperturbative result is valuable by itself , it is also an important guide for those who work on developing phenomenological models for the nonperturbative problem . </S>",
    "<S> the feynman - schwinger representation approach provides a convenient framework for calculating nonperturbative propagators . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we provide an algorithm for computing 1,2 , and 3 body bound states with the inclusion of all self energies , vertex corrections , ladder and crossed ladder exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is done in the quenched approximation by ignoring the matter loops . </S>",
    "<S> we provide simulation results for 1,2 and 3-body states .    </S>",
