    "accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics and play a fundamental role in areas as diverse as planet formation , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , and accretion onto supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies .",
    "the accretion of gas in disks requires outward transport of angular momentum , typically assumed to be provided by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mri has been widely studied using mhd simulations . however , in many cases the mhd approach is not directly applicable .",
    "when the time scale for electron and ion coulomb collisions is longer than the inflow time in the disk , the plasma is macroscopically collisionless and mhd breaks down .",
    "this is the case in radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) models , applicable when the accretion rate is less than a few percent of eddington @xcite . the low rate of coulomb collisions implies that ions and electrons are thermally decoupled , so the plasma should be two - temperature .",
    "riafs are ubiquitous , occurring , for example , in the low - hard state of x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and around the central supermassive black hole in the milky way ( sgr a * ) and most nearby galaxies .",
    "the first efforts to understand the mri in the collisionless limit were done using the kinetic mhd approach ( quataert et al .",
    "2002 ; sharma et al . 2003",
    "; sharma et al . 2006 ; see also the closely related work by balbus 2004 and islam & balbus 2005 ) .",
    "these studies highlighted the importance of pressure anisotropies with respect to the local magnetic field , @xmath0 , and incorporated the evolution of the pressure parallel and perpendicular to @xmath0 in a fluid model of the plasma .",
    "in particular , an increase in the magnetic field due to the mri causes the plasma temperature @xmath7 ( and pressure , @xmath8 ) of a given particle species @xmath9 to increase in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field due to the conservation of the magnetic moment , @xmath10 , on scales larger than their larmor radius ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass density of species @xmath9 ) .",
    "( throughout this paper the subscript @xmath9 will stand for the particle species , @xmath13 for ions and @xmath14 for electrons).this way , on average , the pressures perpendicular ( @xmath15 ) and parallel ( @xmath16 ) to the local magnetic field must satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "we expect that this anisotropy is ultimately regulated by kinetic micro - instabilities ( e.g. , ion cyclotron , mirror , firehose , electron whistler , etc ) , as shown by previous detailed calculations of the kinetic stability of plasmas with anisotropic pressure , pic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by solar wind observations @xcite .",
    "the kinetic mhd simulations of @xcite modeled the presence of these instabilities by setting an upper limit to @xmath18 .",
    "this limit on the temperature anisotropy plays a critical role in the evolution of the mri , making the physics much more mhd - like than it otherwise would have been .",
    "indeed , the saturation of the mri is qualitatively similar to that in mhd @xcite . one significant difference , however , is that the presence of a pressure anisotropy leads to an anisotropic pressure stress that may be as important for angular momentum transport and plasma heating as the magnetic stress .    in this paper",
    ", we study the collisionless mri using first - principle 1d and 2d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations .",
    "we defer more realistic - but also more computationally expensive - 3d calculations to a future paper . in a pic code ,",
    "the plasma is represented by a collection of macro - particles that carry charge and mass , and are moved by integration of the lorentz equations .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are evolved by solving maxwell s equations on a grid , where the current is calculated by adding the contribution of each macro - particle .",
    "given its complete treatment of plasmas , the pic approach has the ability to capture the whole dynamics of the particles and fields .",
    "in particular , the mri , the resulting evolution of the plasma pressure anisotropy , the interaction of particles with small - scale kinetic instabilities , and particle heating and acceleration are all self - consistently captured .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic equations and the simulation setup are explained in  [ sec : baseq ] and  [ sec : setup ] , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : injection ] , a thorough dispersion relation study is performed based on 1d simulations , which we compare with previous analytic results .",
    "we also study the nonlinear magnetic field amplification by the mri in 1d . in  [ sec : parameters ] , we explore the non - linear evolution of the mri - driven turbulence using more realistic 2d simulations .",
    "special attention is paid to the field saturation , particle heating , pressure anisotropy evolution , and the contribution of the different stress tensor components to angular momentum transport . finally , in  [",
    "sec : disconclu ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we carry out our study in the local , small - box approximation , where the size of the simulation box is much smaller than its distance to the center of the disk , @xmath19 .",
    "the box rotates with the disk at the local ( keplerian ) orbital frequency @xmath20 , so the reference frame is non - inertial . in the rotating frame ,",
    "maxwell s equations acquire extra terms @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath2 is the speed of light .",
    "our approach is to neglect all of the terms due to the non - inertial reference frame in equations [ eq : gaussrot ] and [ eq : amprot ] .",
    "we now justify this approximation . in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the last two terms on the right hand side of equation [ eq : amprot ] are much smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "thus , when @xmath23 , it is possible to assume that @xmath25 .",
    "however , because our numerical technique is relativistic ( see  [ sec : setup ] ) , we can not neglect the displacement current in equation [ eq : amprot ] , since it is used to evolve @xmath26 .",
    "we thus choose to integrate equation [ eq : amprot ] neglecting the last two terms on the right hand side . even though this approximation is not expected to affect the mhd - scale dynamics of the plasma",
    ", the neglected terms can still formally be larger than the displacement current @xmath27 , which is not accurately evolved regardless of the @xmath23 condition .",
    "the effect of this can be seen in equation [ eq : gaussrot ] , where the last two terms of the right hand side represent the appearance of extra electric charges in the rotating box . in particular",
    ", the term proportional to @xmath28 can be much larger than @xmath29 if @xmath30 .",
    "this is expected in the case of the small - box approximation , where the typical magnitude of the turbulence velocity ( @xmath31 ) is much smaller than @xmath32 . as a first approach to this problem",
    ", we will neglect the existence of theses extra charges , assuming that they do not affect the plasma microphysics .",
    "thus , our simulations will solve the standard maxwell s equation , with the additional forces due to gravity acting on each particle individually .    in the rotating frame , the particles will experience lorentz forces , plus the coriolis and tidal forces ; in the case of a keplerian disk , these are given by the well known expressions : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the particle s momentum and velocity , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are its mass and charge , and @xmath38 corresponds to the radial coordinate .",
    "the expressions for the coriolis and tidal forces presented in equation [ eq : cortidal1 ] are valid in the  cold \" limit ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "even though in our simulations the particles will reach relativistic velocities , the validity of the cold limit will still hold , but in a fluid sense .",
    "this means that , as long as the fluid velocity for each species satisfies @xmath39 , the fluid dynamics will be well described by the cold limit expression ( equation [ eq : cortidal1 ] ) . also ,",
    "since in the mri turbulence @xmath40 can be similar to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , where the subscript @xmath43 stands for ions ) , our non - relativistic , cold limit will be strictly valid when @xmath44 .",
    "our simulations are performed using the electromagnetic pic code tristan - mp @xcite in one and two dimensions . in 2d ,",
    "the simulation box consists of a rectangle in the @xmath45 plane , where @xmath38 corresponds to the radial coordinate and @xmath46 represents the vertical direction of the disk . the azimuthal direction ( into the simulation plane )",
    "is given by the @xmath47 axis .",
    "the shearing velocity is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the shearing parameter ( @xmath50 , in the keplerian case ) .    in standard mhd simulations ,",
    "shearing periodic boundary conditions are used along the radial ( @xmath38 ) direction ( see , e.g. , hawley et al .",
    "1995 ) . in that case",
    ", galilean transformations of the mhd quantities at the boundaries are made to compensate for their initial velocity difference @xmath51 .",
    "these shearing periodic boundary conditions can not be self - consistently implemented in pic simulations .",
    "this is because , under a relativistic change of reference frame , the transformation of @xmath52 can not be obtained by only transforming the velocity of particles .",
    "this can introduce charge conservation problems at the box boundaries , even if @xmath53 .",
    "we avoid this difficulty by implementing _ shearing coordinates _ , in which the grid moves with the shearing velocity @xmath48 . in this new frame , the net plasma velocity at the boundaries cancels out , allowing the use of periodic boundary conditions . in the shearing coordinate system ,",
    "the 2d version of maxwell s equations get modified by the presence of extra terms in faraday and ampere s equations .",
    "the new equations read @xmath54 @xmath55 ( see appendix [ sec : shearcoord ] for the derivation of equations [ eq : ind ] and [ eq : amp ] ) .    apart from the modifications to maxwell s equations , forces on the particles",
    "will also transform in the shearing coordinate system : @xmath56 where @xmath34 is the particle momentum .",
    "we can see that the combination of tidal and coriolis forces are substantially modified , with no dependence on the @xmath38 coordinate in the shearing frame , and the modified expression for the induction law given by equation [ eq : ind ] are equivalent to the 2d versions of equations 14 and 15 of @xcite .",
    "these equations correspond to the mhd momentum evolution and induction equations , expressed in terms of @xmath57 * v * @xmath58 * v * - * v*@xmath59 , with * v * being the total fluid velocity and * v*@xmath60 . ]",
    "( see appendix [ sec : shearcoord ] for the derivation of equation [ eq : fuerza ] ) .",
    "thus , our initial set up will consist of a periodic box where , apart from lorentz forces , particles are pushed by the forces corresponding to the first two terms in the right hand side of equation [ eq : fuerza ] , and where the fields are evolved according to equations [ eq : ind ] and [ eq : amp ] .",
    "( @xmath61 ) with an extra term that depends on @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , we integrate @xmath64 ( @xmath61 ) using simple time and space interpolations of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this way , after this modifications are implemented , the numerical algorithm used by tristan - mp continues to be second order accurate in time and space . ]",
    "our simulations are defined by a series of parameters , which set both the physical conditions and numerical resolution of the runs .",
    "the physical parameters are the ion to electron mass ratio @xmath65 , the initial magnetic field direction and strength , the orbital frequency @xmath66 , the initial ion and electron pressures @xmath67 , and the @xmath38 and @xmath46 sizes of the box ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "the initial magnetic field along @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is quantified using the corresponding alfvn velocity of the plasma , @xmath72 ) .",
    "the box size is normalized by @xmath73 ( roughly the wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode in the mhd limit ) , and the orbital frequency is expressed in terms of the initial ion cyclotron frequency @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , so our free parameter is the plasma magnetization @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the initial pressure of the particles is expressed in terms of their initial beta parameter , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .    in order to understand our choice of parameters , it is useful to know how they affect the total computing time , @xmath79 , of the runs .",
    "the computational cost of a simulation is proportional to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the number of particles per cell , while @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the number of times steps and of grid points of the runs , respectively .",
    "thus , it is possible to show that the computing time necessary to run a 2d simulation for a given number of orbital periods , @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , scales as @xmath86\\times \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\big[((c/\\omega_{p , e})/\\delta_x)^3(l/\\lambda_0)^2 n_{ppc}(\\delta_x/(\\delta_tc))\\big ] , \\label{eq : scale}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the electron inertial length , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 represent the grid spacing and simulation time step , respectively .",
    "equation [ eq : scale ] shows that the computing time increases for large values of the mass ratio ( @xmath65 ) and magnetization ( @xmath76 ) , and for small values of the initial alfvn velocity ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "in addition , there is the increase in computing time due to spatial resolution ( @xmath91 ) , box size ( @xmath92 ) , and particle resolution ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "thus , in general , our simulations will use rather low values for the ion to electron mass ratio , @xmath65 , and magnetization , @xmath76 , and high values of @xmath90 .",
    "the low mass ratios and magnetizations used in our runs will be significantly far from realistic values .",
    "we will assess the dependence of our results on these parameters .",
    "in this section we study the linear behavior of the collisionless mri , and compare our results with previous analytical studies .",
    "we use 1d simulations , where the @xmath38 ( radial ) dimension is reduced to a few cells ; this way only wave vectors , @xmath93 , pointing along the @xmath94axis are resolved . the box length along @xmath46 , @xmath69 ,",
    "is varied in such a way that only one single mode ( with @xmath95 ) can grow .",
    "the mode is seeded by means of an initial plasma velocity @xmath96 , which , by itself , would induce an alfvn wave of linear amplitude in the plasma ( @xmath97 ) . by measuring the growth rates in each case ,",
    "we calculate the mri dispersion relation , which then we compare with previous analytical results .",
    "the simulation parameters for each dispersion relation studied are specified in table [ table:1d ] .",
    "we explore both the weak field regime @xcite , and also the high magnetization limit @xcite . although our main focus is the highly magnetized case ( @xmath98 ) , the study of the low magnetization limit will help us understand the parameter regime that minimizes the effect of weak fields , while optimizing the use of computer time .",

    "ferraro s analytical prediction is consistent with our numerical calculation only for @xmath102 ( see his figure 1 ) . for @xmath118 ,",
    "his prediction is that larger temperatures increase the upper limit of the unstable wave numbers and reduce the maximum growth rate .",
    "we do not find this dependence on the sign of @xmath71 .",
    "this may be because our simulations use electrons in energy equipartition with the ions , in contrast with the perfectly cold electrons used by @xcite . in any case",
    ", if the dependence on @xmath77 in figure [ fig : betadepen ] is caused by flr effects of the kind predicted by @xcite , then increasing the plasma magnetization for fixed @xmath77 should cause our results to approach the limit in which flr effects are negligible .",
    "we tested this by taking runs o7 and o8 ( with @xmath117 ) and increasing their magnetization by a factor of 6 to @xmath119 ( while keeping the same @xmath77 ) .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relations are shown by the blue lines in figure [ fig : betadepen ] . increasing the magnetization indeed increases the range of unstable wave numbers , with the results approaching the cold plasma ( zero flr effects ) results .",

    "this is a consequence of the ion larmor radius increasing with increasing @xmath121 .",
    "there is no substantial difference between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    ", it is assumed that @xmath123 and also that flr effects are unimportant , i.e. the ion gyroradius is much smaller than @xmath124 .",
    "one of the main differences with respect to standard mhd is the increase in both the growth rate and the wavelength of the fastest growing mode , which happens for large @xmath77 in the presence of a significant toroidal magnetic field .",

    "no substantial difference is observed when comparing with the @xmath106 cases.,width=302 ]      most of our non - linear mri analysis will be done using 2d simulations . in this section , however , we determine a saturation criterion for the magnetic amplification in 1d .",

    "the black , green and red lines correspond to @xmath137 , and 1 ( runs o22 , o20 , and o21 of table [ table:1d ] ) , and the solid and dashed lines show the evolution of their radial and azimuthal magnetic energies , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "the maximum amplification of @xmath62 in all three cases satisfies @xmath143 ( where @xmath144 corresponds to the alfvn velocity calculated only with the @xmath38 component of the magnetic field ) .",
    "after the saturation of the radial field , @xmath64 continues to grow , but at a significantly lower rate .",
    "this result appears to be independent of the size of the box ( it was also tested for @xmath140 ) , and other parameters like @xmath65 , @xmath76 , and @xmath120 . note also that for @xmath145 the linear growth rate is reduced , leading to a suppressed exponential growth of @xmath62 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , by assumption , our treatment of the mri is valid only in the non - relativistic regime , i.e. , when @xmath146 .",
    "this regime is the most interesting since @xmath147 corresponds to a magnetic field energy close to the rest mass energy of the particles , which should be precluded by energy conservation , except very close to a black hole event horizon .",
    "thus , this saturation criterion implies that , at least in 1d , there is no mechanism stopping the growth of the field .    in the next section",
    "we study how this 1d evolution is modified by 2d effects .",
    "we also analyze the sources of angular momentum transport in detail , and study the interplay between the non - linear mri turbulence and particle heating .",
    "our 2d analysis is organized in four parts .",
    "first ,  [ nonlinear ] describes the overall non - linear behavior of the mri turbulence , paying special attention to its saturation . ",
    "[ zeroflux ] briefly discusses how the non - linear evolution is modified in the zero magnetic flux case . ",

    "[ sec : saturation ] .",
    "indeed , there are only two important differences relative to the 1d case .",
    "the first one is the growth of @xmath168 , which can not occur in the 1d case ( @xmath169 can not have a component along @xmath70 , given that @xmath170 ) .",
    "the other difference is that , regardless of the initial @xmath171 , the exponential field growth stops at @xmath172 .",
    "this can be explained by the role of magnetic reconnection in dissipating the field energy in the non - linear regime of our 2d runs .",
    "figure [ fig : mri2dbxbybzb2 ] shows the 2d structure of the magnetic field for run t1 , with the three field components along with the magnetic energy plotted at @xmath173 , 3.6 and @xmath174 .        at @xmath175",

    "on the other hand , the field has been amplified to @xmath179 and the dominant wavelength has grown to @xmath180 .",
    "this migration to longer wavelengths occurs along with the reconnection of magnetic field lines associated with the small wavelength modes as they become non - linear .",
    "magnetic reconnection takes place in thin current sheets , where @xmath62 and @xmath64 switch sign .",
    "along with the onset of reconnection , there is the appearance of loop - like structures ( see , for instance , the one at @xmath181 in figures [ fig : mri2dbxbybzb2]@xmath182-[fig : mri2dbxbybzb2]@xmath183 ) .",
    "the magnetic loops also correspond to regions of high plasma density , as can be seen from figure [ fig : mri2dbxdens ] , which shows the evolution of the plasma density , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 for run t1 .",
    "the formation of loops is much clearer at @xmath186 . at that stage , they appear as overdense regions ( @xmath187 ) , in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding magnetic field .",
    "as @xmath64 gradually decays , the magnetic energy corresponding to @xmath62 and @xmath168 stays rather constant .",
    "this energy is contained primarily in the magnetic loops , as can be seen from the field plots at @xmath186 in figures [ fig : mri2dbxbybzb2]@xmath43-[fig : mri2dbxbybzb2]@xmath188 . at this point ,",
    "the fields are in a quiescent state , with the loops experiencing almost no evolution ( as can also be inferred from the smooth magnetic energy evolution after @xmath189 in figure [ fig : magevocompare ] ) .",
    "this implies that , at late times , the growth of new linear mri modes is dramatically suppressed .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the migration of the growing modes to large wavelengths due to finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects at large @xmath77 ( see  [ sec : mhdlimit ] ) .",
    "indeed , for the relatively low magnetization @xmath190 of simulation t1 , the observed increase in temperature corresponds to @xmath191 ( when only the initial @xmath71 is considered ) , which makes the particle s gyroradii outside of the loops larger than @xmath124 ( after @xmath64 has been significantly dissipated ) .",
    "thus , flr effects should significantly increase the wavelength of the unstable modes , presumably to length - scales larger than the box size . in a realistic astrophysical scenario , however , the mri will not be suppressed by flr effects .",
    "indeed , @xmath76 is typically many orders of magnitude larger than the value used in our simulations , which would make flr effects negligible @xcite .",
    "also , in all of our simulations the quiescent state happens after the mri has reached the saturation condition @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "however , we expect the mri to saturate before reaching this condition in a more realistic 3d problem . indeed , we believe that the 2d geometry of our simulations favors both the different evolution of @xmath64 ( compared with @xmath62 and @xmath168 ) and the unrestricted field growth in the non - relativistic regime ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "loop formation makes reconnection a 2d phenomenon , which is favored if these structures are well resolved by the simulation . in our 2d runs , this is the case only for reconnection of field lines laying mainly on the @xmath45 plane .     and box size @xmath192 ( with the 3d case having @xmath193 ) .",

    "figure [ fig : mri2dbxdensnoflux ] shows the density and @xmath62 of run t12 , which is analogous to run t3 but with @xmath199 . in the zero net flux case the mri initially grows faster in the low field regions .",
    "this is due to finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects , as explained in ",
    "[ sec : mhdlimit ] .",

    "the amplification seems to increase in the case of run t14 ( @xmath106 ; green line ) , which has a @xmath203 twice as large as the one in run t13 .",
    "thus , in zero net flux simulations , field amplification depends on box size ( @xmath192 ) , which is not the case in simulations with net vertical flux.,width=302 ]    the mri saturates at smaller amplitude with no net flux , compared with finite net flux .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : magevocomparenoflux ] , where the magnetic energy evolution of runs t12 ( @xmath132 ) and t13 ( @xmath106 ) are depicted in black and red lines , respectively . with no net flux ,",
    "the saturation is no longer characterized by a particular value of @xmath147 ( as in the finite flux case ; see figure [ fig : magevocompare ] ) . instead , different values of @xmath90 saturate with similar amplification factors : @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 .",
    "also , the x - size of the box @xmath203 appears to play a role in the final saturation , as can be seen by comparing runs t13 and t14 ( which are equal except for having @xmath207 and 16 , respectively ) .",
    "indeed , t14 produces somewhat larger values of @xmath208 than t13 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , for sufficiently large @xmath68 , regions of positive and negative initial @xmath209 will behave as spatially distinct regions , being able to reach saturation at amplitudes similar to the finite flux cases .",

    "the significant role of the mirror instability will be confirmed below by directly identifying the presence of mirror modes embedded in the mri turbulence .",
    "figure [ fig : enstressani1 ] shows that the anisotropic stress begins to dominate for @xmath269 .",

    "this large beta behavior also happens for @xmath278 , as in runs t8 and 11 .",

    "however , this would require using values of the magnetization parameter @xmath76 significantly larger than those used here ( so that the mri and microinstabilities length scales are properly separated ) , which is computationally difficult ( see equation [ eq : scale ] ) .",
    "we expect that the saturation of both the magnetic field and the pressure anisotropy will be fundamentally different in 3d simulations . in that case , magnetic field amplification is expected to stop when @xmath146 , which would allow the existence of a turbulent state in which @xmath322 ( see , e.g. , the 2d vs. 3d fluid simulations in figure [",
    "fig : t1mhd2d3d ] ) .",
    "our results suggest that transport and heating due to the anisotropic stress will be important in this regime .",
    "absent any mechanism of temperature isotropization which is provided by collisions in the fluid limit  the pressure anisotropy would continue to grow throughout the linear phase of the mri in a low - collisionality plasma . in our calculations , we find direct evidence for collisionless processes that provide temperature isotropization in the absence of coulomb collisions . in particular , the @xmath323 state that is generically created by the mri is unstable to the excitation of mirror modes ( see figures [ fig : mirror - zoom1 ] and [ fig : mirror - zoom2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , once mirror excitation commences the volume - averaged pressure anisotropy remains near the threshold for the onset of the mirror instability , particularly in our higher @xmath121 simulations ( as shown in figures [ fig : enstressani1]@xmath182 and figures [ fig : enstressani1]@xmath210 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the evolution of the pressure anisotropy observed in the near - earth solar wind @xcite .",
    "our results , analogous theoretical work in the solar wind context @xcite , and the solar wind measurements all strongly suggest that temperature isotropization in moderate @xmath317 low - collisionality plasmas is dominated by ( reasonably ) well understood velocity space instabilities ( in particular , the mirror , firehose , and ion cyclotron instabilities ) .    in future work , we will study the heating of particles in mri turbulence in detail , paying particular attention to how the assumed electron to ion mass ratio @xmath324 gives rise to different electron and ion heating physics . in our preliminary analysis in the present paper",
    ", we found that particle heating occurs via two dominant mechanisms : one is reconnection and the other is the viscous heating produced by the anisotropic stress @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "these different heating processes are expected to imprint different signatures in the energy spectra of particles .",
    "perhaps most interestingly , we find that magnetic reconnection produces a distinctive power - law distribution function ( with spectral index @xmath325 ) as the mri becomes nonlinear , but before the turbulence has saturated and died away ( see figure [ fig : spectra]@xmath218 ) .",
    "this spectral index is similar to the one found by @xcite in their pic study of reconnection forced by relativistic shocks in the striped wind of pulsars . whether this non - thermal energization is due to the reconnection electric field parallel to the current sheet ( as in the case of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by a fermi - like process due to the formation of magnetic loops @xcite , will be clarified in detail in a future work .",
    "the importance of reconnection diminishes once the mri saturates . at that point",
    ", the particle energization appears to be dominated by the anisotropic stress @xmath211 , which is largest outside of the magnetic loops .",
    "this process produces a high - energy bump in the energy spectra of particles ( see figure [ fig : spectra]@xmath222 ) , with the most energetic particles concentrating outside of the magnetic loops . in our calculations",
    "we do not find unambiguous evidence for heating via the turbulent cascade of alfvn and slow waves that is expected to be set up via the nonlinear saturation of the mri @xcite .",
    "this could be a limitation of our 2d simulations which do not develop sustained turbulence ; in addition , such a cascade may be difficult to resolve given the modest dynamic range in our simulations between the inner and outer turbulent scales .",
    "the pic simulations presented in this paper have numerous advantages relative to fluid calculations for studying the physics of the mri in low - collisionality plasmas .",
    "in particular , our pic simulations represent the first self - consistent study of magnetic field amplification and saturation , particle heating , and pressure anisotropy evolution in mri - driven turbulence .",
    "there are , however , also drawbacks associated with pic simulations .",
    "in addition to being very computationally demanding , the need to resolve the electron skin depth implies that there is always an unphysically small dynamic range between the initial ion cyclotron frequency @xmath326 ( where @xmath43 stands for ` ions ' ) and the disk rotation frequency @xmath66 : our simulations initially have @xmath327 instead of @xmath328 in real systems .",
    "this ratio , however , increases to @xmath329 in the nonlinear regime , considering both the magnetic field amplification and the growth of the mean lorentz factor of the particles .",
    "we find no strong dependence of our results on the initial value of @xmath330 , suggesting that we are adequately in the `` mhd '' regime , but this will need to be carefully studied in 3d simulations as well , where the computational requirements are even more demanding .",
    "another limitation of the current calculations is that our results are strictly valid only in the limit @xmath23 ( where @xmath331 is the bulk rotation velocity of the plasma ) . in particular ,",
    "the pic equations evolved here neglect additional terms in maxwell s equations that arise from being in a rotating reference frame ( see appendix [ sec : shearcoord ] ) ; these are self - consistently small in the limit of small rotation velocities .",
    "our analysis does consistently allow for relativistic temperatures and thus it is possible to study quantitatively the limit of relativistic electrons , but non - relativistic ions that is of particular interest for radiatively inefficient accretion flow models .",

    "this means that simple galilean velocity transformations are enough to reproduce the non - relativistic version of current transformation equations [ eq : current ] .",
    "however , since individual particles in our simulations are allowed to become relativistic , we will use the relativistic transformation of their momenta , @xmath34 . this way , we ensure that no particles in @xmath332 exceed the speed of light .",
    "thus , @xmath397 where @xmath36 is the mass of the particle . these relations ( along with the time transformation shown in equation [ eq : lorentz ] ) imply that @xmath398 where @xmath399 and @xmath400 are the @xmath38 and @xmath47 velocities of the particle in the @xmath333 frame .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath401 ) , equations [ eq : translorentz ] correspond to the standard force transformation between two inertial frames , plus an extra force @xmath402 .",
    "thus , given that the electric and magnetic fields transform analogous to the usual relativistic field transformation , one can easily show that the time evolution of the particles momenta in @xmath332 will be given by the lorentz forces , plus the extra term @xmath402.in addition to these forces , we also need to find out what is the transformation of the coriolis and tidal forces forces on the particles .",
    "we know that in the @xmath333 frame .",
    "since in our simulations individual particles are allowed to get accelerated to velocities @xmath403 , the validity of the cold limit will be in a fluid sense .",
    "thus , as long as the mean velocities of the particles is non - relativistic , the contribution of gravity to particles dynamics will be well described by equation [ eq : cortidal ] . ]",
    "@xmath404 it is straightforward to show that , in the cold limit , the @xmath332 version of equation [ eq : cortidal ] becomes @xmath405 since this force does not do work on a particle , it can be equivalently expressed in terms of @xmath406 instead of @xmath407 .",
    "thus , combining equation [ eq : cortidalsh ] with the transformation to lorentz forces found above , we get @xmath408 where @xmath37 is the charge of the particle.finally , it is important to point out that the momentum transformation shown in equations [ eq : mom ] is not entirely consistent with the evolution of particles positions .",
    "indeed , by directly differentiating equation [ eq : lorentz ] one gets @xmath409 in the non - relativistic regime , the discrepancy appears only in @xmath410 . in the 2d case",
    ", this does not imply an inconsistency between the values of @xmath410 and the evolution of the @xmath366 position of particles ( where by definition @xmath411 ) . in 3d ,",
    "on the other hand , this implies a violation of charge conservation , which will need to be taken into account in future 3d studies of this problem ."
