    "although the errors for the suzuki 4115 dirk were about @xmath0 times smaller than those of 4124d for the fixed time  steps used , the timings indicate that the latter method is slightly more efficient .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the article considers symmetric general linear methods , a class of numerical time integration methods which , like symmetric runge  kutta methods , are applicable to general time  reversible differential equations , not just those derived from separable second  order problems . a definition of time  reversal symmetry is formulated for general linear methods , and criteria are found for the methods to be free of linear parasitism . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that symmetric parasitism  free methods can not be explicit , but a method of order @xmath0 is constructed with only one implicit stage . </S>",
    "<S> several characterizations of symmetry are given , and connections are made with @xmath1symplecticity . </S>",
    "<S> symmetric methods are shown to be of even order , a suitable symmetric starting method is constructed and shown to be essentially unique . the underlying one  step method is shown to be time  symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> several symmetric methods of order @xmath0 are constructed and implemented on test problems . </S>",
    "<S> the methods are efficient when compared with runge  kutta methods of the same order , and invariants of the motion are well  approximated over long time intervals . </S>"
