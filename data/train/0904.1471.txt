    "the new generation of radioactive beam facilities , e.g. the future gsi facility fair in germany , the rare isotope accelerator planned in the united states of america or spiral2 at ganil / france , facilitate the nuclear structure studies away from the line of @xmath1-stability , especially for the neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the study of these nuclei is of high interest since they represent important steps in the nuclear reaction chains for the formation of elements .",
    "the weak binding energies of these nuclei and the corresponding large spatial extensions of the orbits for the valence nucleons lead to very interesting features like e.g. a neutron halo made of several neutrons outside the core .",
    "these nuclei can furthermore be understood as a first step in the transition from isolated nuclei to infinite homogeneous matter , which should occur in the outer crust of a neutron star .",
    "this transition is a very good example for a quantum liquid with a phase transition from the droplet to the homogeneous phase .",
    "this transition is a challenge for theoretical nuclear structure physics as it incorporates the transition from isolated nuclei via a crystal - like structure of quasi - nuclei embedded in a sea of neutrons to the phase of homogeneous baryon matter .",
    "these structures have been described by means of thomas - fermi calculations or mean - field calculations in a wigner - seitz cell using simple phenomenological models for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction like the density - dependent skyrme forces@xcite or a relativistic mean - field approach@xcite .",
    "all these investigations are based on phenomenological interactions , which have been adjusted to describe the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the structure of stable nuclei with large binding energies located in the valley of @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "these models and interactions have been developed to provide a simple description of the mean field in terms of local single - particle densities .",
    "the predictive power of such simple phenomenological interactions , however , may be rather limited as these models have been constructed to fit the data of finite nuclei .",
    "an alternative to this phenomenological approach is the use of so - called realistic interactions like the charge - dependent bonn interaction@xcite or one of the argonne interaction models@xcite .",
    "such realistic interactions are based e.g. on the meson exchange model and adjusted to describe the experimental data of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering .",
    "these interactions contain rather strong short range and tensor components , which make it inevitable to employ non - perturbative approximation schemes for the solution of the many - body problem for the nuclear hamiltonian based on such interactions@xcite .",
    "nuclear structure calculations using such interactions have become feasible for very light nuclei and provide a very good description if an appropriate three - nucleon force has been added@xcite . in the next future",
    "such sophisticated calculations will not be possible for heavier nuclei or the nuclear structures in the crust of neutron stars mentioned above .",
    "a possible way out of this problem is to consider an interaction model , which separates the low - momentum ( below a cut - off @xmath2 ) and high - momentum components of a realistic nn interaction by means of renormalization techniques@xcite .",
    "if the cutoff @xmath2 is chosen around @xmath2 = 2 @xmath3 the resulting low - momentum interaction @xmath0 still describes the nn scattering data up to the pion threshold and turns out to be independent of the underlying realistic interaction @xmath4 .",
    "since the high - momentum components , which correspond to the short - distance behavior , of @xmath4 have been removed , the resulting @xmath0 does not produce short - range correlations in a significant way , but can be treated within the hartree - fock approximation@xcite .",
    "employing @xmath0 in a calculation of nuclear matter , however , one obtains a binding energy per nucleon increasing with density in a monotonic way , such that no saturation point is obtained@xcite . in order to compensate this deficiency",
    "we will supplement @xmath0 by a simple density - dependent contact interaction adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation property of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this density - dependent contact interaction , which is introduced to obtain the empirical saturation point of nuclear matter , can also be interpreted as a parameterization of the three - nucleon force , which , as discussed above , seems to be necessary for a microscopic description of nuclear structure data based on realistic nn interactions .",
    "therefore we had the hope to obtain a good description of finite nuclei using this interaction model .",
    "we will demonstrate below that this hope has been fulfilled to a good extent .",
    "because of the non - locality of @xmath0 nuclear structure calculations of finite nuclei using this interaction are typically not performed in coordinate space but employ a set of appropriate single - particle wave functions as a set of basis states , typically those of a harmonic oscillator potential . the choice of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis seems to be rather plausible if one wants to describe the structure deeply bound , double magic nuclei like @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7@xcite . this choice may be questionable if nuclei close to the proton or neutron drip line are to be considered",
    ". the ho basis may not be appropriate to describe the tail of the single - particle wave functions for the weakly bound valence nucleons .",
    "the main reason , why this oscillator basis is so popular , must be attributed to the fact that the ho basis provides a simple transformation from relative coordinates in coordinate or momentum space to a coordinate system located in a laboratory frame .",
    "such a transformation is required to allow for structure calculation of finite nuclei using realistic interaction as defined e.g. by @xmath0 .",
    "the ho basis is certainly not appropriate to describe the quasi - nuclear structures in the pasta phase of neutron stars mentioned above . for those studies",
    "a basis of plane wave ( pw ) states confined to a finite box with a size large to the nuclear dimension may be more suitable and could be considered as an appropriate basis for a wigner - seitz cell calculation@xcite .",
    "one of the main aims of this work is to establish the techniques , which are needed to allow for nuclear structure calculations of finite nuclear systems using realistic interactions in such a pw basis .    in this work",
    "we describe double magic nuclei and weakly bound neutron - rich nuclei in the framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) plus bcs calculation using a @xmath0 potential supplemented with a contact interaction .",
    "we are going to investigate nuclei up to @xmath8 and compare the results of calculations using ho and pw basis states .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "the procedure to renormalize the low - momentum interaction and obtain the matrix elements of @xmath0 is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : vlowk_mat_el ] . in this section",
    "we also describe our interaction model supplementing @xmath0 by an appropriate contact interaction .",
    "we also work out how to solve the hf equation in a basis of harmonic oscillator and plane wave states .",
    "this section is completed by a short description of the bcs procedure .",
    "the results for infinite matter and finite nuclei are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : r&d ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : sc ] contains a summary and the conclusions of our work .",
    "the idea behind the @xmath0 interaction model is to separate the low - momentum and high - momentum components of realistic interactions and restrict the nuclear structure calculation to the low - momentum components .",
    "this means that one tries to define a model space , which accounts for the low - momentum degrees of freedom and renormalizes the effective hamiltonian for this low - momentum regime to account for the effects of the high - momentum parts , which are integrated out . a model space technique to disentangle these parts , the unitary - model - operator approach ( umoa ) @xcite ,",
    "can be used to calculate the matrix elements for @xmath0 .",
    "first , we define the projection operators @xmath9 , which projects onto the low - momentum subspace , and @xmath10 , which projects onto the complement of this subspace , as in all well known model space techniques .",
    "furthermore , these operators satisfy the usual relations like @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the idea of the unitary - model - operator approach is now to define a unitary transformation @xmath15 so that the transformed hamiltonian does not couple @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which means @xmath16 has to be fulfilled .",
    "the effective interaction is defined in terms of this unitary transformation as @xmath17 with @xmath18 representing the bare @xmath19-interaction and a starting hamiltonian @xmath20 describing the one - body part of the two - body system .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath15 can be written as @xmath21 with an operator @xmath22 fulfilling @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in @xcite",
    "the operator @xmath22 is obtained by first solving the two - body eigenvalue equation @xmath25 and afterwards defining the matrix elements of @xmath22 using the eigenstates @xmath26 having the largest overlap with the @xmath9 space . with the corresponding @xmath15",
    "then the effective interaction @xmath27 is calculated as described in @xcite . in this way one",
    "obtains an effective hamiltonian @xmath28 , which contains this effective interaction @xmath27 .",
    "the eigenvalues , which are obtained by diagonalizing this effective hamiltonian in the model - space ( @xmath9-space ) , are identical to the diagonalization of the original hamiltonian @xmath29 in the complete space .",
    "this model - space scheme can now be applied to the effective two - nucleon problem by considering for the basis states of the 2-nucleon system the states identified by the relative momentum , its modulus and the corresponding partial waves . for a given partial wave",
    "the states of the @xmath9-space are identified as those states with a relative momentum smaller than a cutoff @xmath2 . applying the technique described above leads to the effective interaction @xmath0 .",
    "solving now the schroedinger equation for @xmath0 within the model space , e.g. by solving the lipmann schwinger equation for @xmath19 scattering with the cutoff @xmath2 , yields the same phase shift as solving the lipmann schwinger equation without cutoff for the original interaction @xmath18 .",
    "if the original interaction @xmath18 is realistic in the sense , that it has been fitted to the experimental nn phase - shifts , these phase shifts , up to the cutoff @xmath2 , will also be reproduced by @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the resulting @xmath0 is found to be essentially model independent .",
    "this means that the potential is independent of the underlying realistic interaction @xmath18 , if the cutoff @xmath2 is chosen around @xmath2 = 2 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , one is able to extract a low - momentum potential @xmath0 , which in a model independent manner describes the low - momentum component of realistic nn interactions in a more or less unique way . note , that , by construction , this @xmath0 interaction is defined in terms of matrix elements in a basis of nn states labelled by relative momentum .",
    "the fact that the high - momentum or short - range components of realistic nn interactions have been integrated out by means of the unitary transformation of eq .  ( [ eq : umoa ] ) , seems to lead to problems in the description of the saturation behavior of nuclear matter . because of",
    "this lack of short - range correlation effects , which are modified in the medium , the emergence of a saturation point is prevented in calculations of symmetric nuclear matter  @xcite . in order to achieve saturation in symmetric nuclear matter , three - body interaction terms or density - dependent two - nucleon interactions are needed .",

    "it is given by @xmath48 where the direct term is @xmath49 and the exchange term is @xmath50 note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are local .",
    "they are defined in terms of the single - particle densities @xmath53 resulting from the eigenstates of @xmath54 , which implies that they have to be determined in a self - consistent way , as usual for hf calculations . as it has been mentioned above",
    ", the effective interaction @xmath0 is non - local and defined in terms of matrix elements .",
    "this implies that the hf calculation has to be performed in a hilbert space using an appropriate basis @xmath55 .",

    "if we restrict the hf variational procedure to a spherical description of nuclei , as we will do in the following , the hf hamiltonian is diagonal in the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath61 and the expansion is simplified to @xmath62 where @xmath63 are expansion coefficients and @xmath64 are the wave functions of our orthogonal basis .",
    "the number of basis states @xmath65 has to be chosen to guarantee that the results are not affected by this limitation .",
    "note , that using this coordinate space representation of the basis states allows the calculation of the matrix elements of @xmath66 for local terms in @xmath67 in a straight forward way .    in this paper calculations",
