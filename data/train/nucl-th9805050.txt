    "excitation energy dependence of the giant resonance is still one of the open problems in the study of collective modes in nuclei at finite temperatures .",
    "recent experimental investigations of the giant dipole resonance in the mass region @xmath0=110 - 140 @xcite and the @xmath1 nucleus @xcite show that damping monotonically increases with excitation energy , and in the former case , saturates at high excitations . in medium - weight and heavy nuclei at relatively low temperatures the owerwhelming contribution to damping arises from the spreading width @xmath2 due to mixing of collective states with more complicated states , which is dominated by the coupling with 2p-2h doorway excitations @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two different approaches for calculation of the spreading width @xmath2 : ( i ) coherent mechanism due to coupling with low - lying surface modes which provides an important mechanism for damping of giant resonance in particular at low temperatures @xcite , ( ii ) damping due to the coupling with incoherent 2p-2h states which is usually referred to as the collisional damping @xcite and the landau damping modified by two - body collisions @xcite .",
    "calculations carried out on the basis of these approaches are partially successful in explaining the broadening of the giant dipole resonance with increasing temperature , but the saturation is still an open problem @xcite . in this work",
    ", we do not consider the coherent contribution to the spreading width due to the coupling with low - lying surface modes , but investigate in detail the collisional damping at finite temperature due to decay of the collective state into incoherent 2p-2h excitations in the basis of a non - markovian transport approach .",
    "semi - classical transport models of the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) type are often employed for studying nuclear collective vibrations @xcite .",
    "although , these models give a good description for the average resonance energies , they do not provide a realistic description for the collisional relaxation rates . in these standard models ,",
    "the collision term is treated in a markovian approximation by assuming that the two - body collisions are local in both space and time , in accordance with boltzmann s original treatment .",
    "this simplification is usually justified by the fact that the duration of two - body collisions is short on the time scale characteristic of macroscopic evolution of the system . however , when the system possesses fast collective modes with characteristic energies that are not small in comparison with temperature , the standard markovian treatment is inadequate .",
    "it leads to an incorrect energy conservation factor in the collision term , which severely restricts the available 2p-2h phase space for damping of the collective modes .",
    "therefore , for a proper description of the collisional relaxation rates , it is necessary to improve the transport model by including the memory effect due to finite duration of two - body collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , we have investigated the collisional damping of giant resonances within the linearized limit of the buu model with a non - markovian collision term , and derived closed form expressions for damping width of isoscalar and isovector collective vibrations @xcite .",
    "also , the model has been applied to study the density fluctuations and the growth of instabilities in the nuclear matter within the stochastic boltzmann - langevin approach @xcite . as a result of the non - markovian structure of two - body collisions , in expressions of transport coefficients of collective modes ( i.e. damping width and diffusion coefficient ) , the available phase space for decay into 2p-2h states",
    "is properly taken into account with the correct energy conserving factor . in nuclear matter limit and for isotropic nucleon - nucleon cross - sections , by employing the standard approximation familiar in fermi liquid theory , it is possible to give analytical expression for the collisional width as @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is different for different resonance and determined by nuclear matter properties and in - medium cross - sections .",
    "the quadratic temperature dependence fits well with the measured gdr widths in @xmath5 and @xmath6 nuclei , however the factor @xmath4 calculated with a cross - section of 40 mb underestimates the data by a factor of 2 - 3 . in a recent work",
    ", we have performed calculations by employing energy and angle dependent free nucleon - nucleon cross - sections and by taking surface effects into account @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we give a brief description of the non - markovian extension of the nuclear transport theory in both quantal and semi - classical frameworks , and present a detailed derivation of the collisional widths of collective vibrations .",
    "the derivation is carried out in both quantal and semi - classical frameworks by considering linearized limits of the extended tdhf and the buu model with memory effects .",
    "the major uncertainty in the calculation of collisional widths arises from the lack of an accurate knowledge of the in - medium cross - sections in the vicinity of fermi energy .",
    "the skyrme force provides a good description of the imaginary part of the single particle optical potential and its radial dependence in the vicinity of fermi energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be suitable for describing in - medium effects in the collision term around fermi energy . by employing an effective skyrme force",

    "the extended model leads to a description of the transport properties of collective modes that is in accordance with the quantal fluctuation - dissipation relation . in this work",
    ", we present a detailed derivation of the collisional widths of isoscalar and isovector collective nuclear vibrations in both quantal and semi - classical frameworks by considering the linearized limits of the extended tdhf and the buu model with non - markovian collision term .",
    "the standard treatment with a markovian collision term leads to vanishing collisional widths at zero temperature .",
    "whereas in the non - markovian treatment the collisional widths are finite and consistent with the landau s expression for damping of zero sound in fermi liquids .",
    "the numerical result of the collisional damping is rather sensitive to the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross - sections around fermi energy , for which an accurate information is not available . in the present investigations , by employing an effective skyrme force with skm parameters , we carry out calculations of the damping widths of giant quadrupole and giant dipole excitations in semi - classical framework , and compare the results with the gdr measurements in @xmath204 and @xmath1 nuclei at finite temperatures . in particular for gdr , the magnitude of the collisional damping with the bare nucleon mass is a sizable fraction of the observed damping widths at zero temperature , however the effective mass further reduces the magnitude of damping in both cases . aside from the magnitude , calculations are qualitatively in agreement with the broadening of gdr widths as a function of temperature in both @xmath204 and @xmath1 nuclei .",
    "one of the main aims of the present investigation was to assess how much of the the total width of gre s is exhausted by decay into the incoherent 2p-2h states .",
    "the calculations have been performed within the thomas - fermi approximation , which is known from independent studies to be very reliable for description of the 2p-2h level densities @xcite .",
    "however , our results remain semi - quantitative , since in the thomas - fermi framework we need the in - medium cross - sections locally down to very low densities , i.e. we need cross - sections which interpolate correctly between the free space and the medium . at the moment such cross - sections are not available ( at least not analytically ) , and thus we were forced to invent our own interpolation scheme , which , although reasonable , is subject to some uncertainties .",
    "we found that a sizeable fraction of @xmath2 is accounted for by the incoherent decay .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the gdr and also to a lesser extend for the gqr .",
    "in addition , we found for the gdr that the percentage of the incoherent decay , depending somewhat on the nucleon effective mass , strongly increases with tempearture .",
    "this finding is not very surprizing , since at temperature @xmath205 mev shell effects are absent and the collectivity of the vibrational states is strongly reduced .",
    "therefore to a good approximation , a hot nucleus can be regarded as a finite blob of a hot fermi gas .",
    "inspite of this , in particular at lower temperatures , the influence of the low - lying collective sates on the damping is missing in our description .",
    "also , the question of the saturation of the gdr width has not been adressed in this work .",
    "further studies are needed for a quantitative description of the damping of nuclear giant resonances .",
