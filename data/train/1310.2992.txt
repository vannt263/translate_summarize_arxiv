    "measurements of time - related parameters of various detectors response have been provided by many experiments . in the field of ultra - high energy",
    "they are large arrays , such as volcano ranch , haverah park , yakutsk and agasa . in recent years",
    "similar measurements are provided at giant array pierre auger observatory ( pao ) with the use of water - filled cherenkov tanks .",
    "all these surveys share one peculiarity : in some large extensive air showers ( eas ) there are registered pulses from particles delayed relatively to registration of the initial particle by @xmath5s , while according to model calculations all main particles of eas disk must arrive compactly within @xmath6s . in works",
    "@xcite we have shown that in showers with @xmath7  ev under certain circumstances in the time - base of scintillation detector response there pulses are observed delayed by time exceeding @xmath8s . according to  @xcite",
    ", one can speak of observing a nucleon component at the observation level at large distances from shower axis , namely   neutrons . in order to interpret the obtained results we have performed calculations of the neutrons arrival time distribution in showers with @xmath9  ev for zenith angles @xmath10 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "we used corsika code ( version 6.900 ) compiled with qgsjet01d model  @xcite .",
    "a brief description of the setup for registering eas particles with detectors of different types is given in  @xcite .",
    "the setup includes three measurement points separated bu @xmath13  m from each other .",
    "synchronization is provided via gps system .",
    "the adc system , which records the pulses , is controlled by triggering signals from the main array and the small setup . after the registering program is started",
    ", the adc continuously converts signals from detectors and cyclically records counts into the buffer memory called `` pre - history '' .",
    "i.e. the `` pre - history '' stores the most recent signals .",
    "the interval between closest counts amounts to @xmath14  ns .",
    "when triggering signal arrives , it is passed to all adc boards , and the other area of buffer memory if filled , called the `` history '' .",
    "the `` history '' stores codes of `` coloring '' of the master signal   was it from the main array or from the small cherenkov setup   and signals from detectors operated from calibrating leds .",
    "the analysis of signals implies treatment of single detectors and their combinations .",
    "the point is that detectors have different thresholds , @xmath15 , @xmath4 and @xmath16  mev , and from comparing their signals it would be possible to estimate the energy of arriving particles and their type . the time distribution of pulses on the time - base allows to measure not only the number of registered particles but also the curvature of a shower disk and its thickness if data were recorded at different distances from a shower axis . in this way , besides integral characteristics derived from lateral distributions of various shower components it is possible to distinguish showers by the structure of detector response .",
    "for example , there is a pronounced difference in the shape of pulses recorded at different distances from the axis , especially in inclined showers where this difference arises from the separation into over - axial and under - axial particles .",
    "the difference in pulse shapes is also observed in readings of surface and underground muon detectors .",
    "it was noted , that in strongly inclined showers there are pulses delayed by significant time .      on the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a temporal distribution is shown of pulses recorded in showers with the energy above @xmath0  ev .",
    "more than 6000 showers were included in the sample , with zenith angle between @xmath11 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is seen that the main fraction of particles arrives within @xmath18s and only a small number of showers ( mainly inclined with energies above @xmath19  ev ) has pulses delayed by more than @xmath20s .",
    "it is not entirely clear what sort of particles the are .        for this work we have performed calculation of lateral distribution functions ( ldf ) for hadrons , muons , electrons and gamma - photons in showers with @xmath9  ev with the use of corsika code ( v.6900 ) and qgsjet01d model  @xcite .",
    "it is seen from the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that ldf of neutrons is less steep compared to other components , i.e. neutrons can propagate to larger distances from shower axis . at distances",
    "further than @xmath21  km from the axis the neutron component exceeds electron and muon components .",
    "hence , neutrons can be detected by products of their moderation in the medium . as a rule , far below the shower maximum and at large distances from the axis it must be slow neutrons of lower energies and products of their moderation",
    "can be low - energy electrons .",
    "this hypothesis was confirmed when electrons were registered in scintillation detectors with the threshold @xmath22  ev .",
    "arrival time distributions of electromagnetic , muon and neutron components calculated for primary proton with @xmath23  ev at core distance @xmath24  m is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it follows that at the distance @xmath25  m and with delays by more than @xmath8s neutrons become a dominant component of eas .    , @xmath26  ev , @xmath27  m , @xmath28s , @xmath29s .",

    "the pulse with maximal delay was registered by detectors with the area @xmath30",
    "m@xmath31 and threshold @xmath22  mev .",
    "the amplitude of this pulse exceeded the background noise significantly .",
    "it is worth noting that in other detectors including the one with @xmath44  m@xmath31 the signal is extremely weak or is absent completely .",
    "it is also should be mentioned that signals delayed by significant time were recorded not in every shower with @xmath7  ev .",
    "our task was to collect as many such showers as possible and to analyze them and clarify the nature of the delayed particles .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    after the analysis of the selected showers it was discovered , that pulses delayed by significant time are effectively registered in showers with the energy above @xmath45  ev and with the zenith angle @xmath46 .",
    "such showers are listed in the table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we suppose that under these conditions the symmetry of shower development is disrupted , unlike in vertical eas events . in inclined showers , starting from @xmath47 a significant separation of particles by their type",
    "occurs . the particle composition in over - axial and under - axial parts shifts towards muon component with some content of nucleon component which is transferred to far periphery of particle lateral distribution . as it was pointed in the work  @xcite",
    ", these particles could be low - energy neutrons which , being neutral , do nt interact with the material of detector or its container but produce low - energy electron and gamma - quanta when are moderated .",
    "these products can be effectively registered by scintillation detectors with @xmath4  mev threshold , but detectors with @xmath15  mev do nt register them . in case of yakutsk array , due to permafrost and large amount of snow in winter , the effectiveness of this process may be high enough : snow and permafrost amplifies the moderation of low - energy neutrons leading to production of albedo electrons which produce response in low - threshold detectors .",
    "it is clearly seen on fig .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig7 ] .",
    "from the analysis of showers with energy above @xmath45  ev and different zenith angles , the following conclusions can be summarized :    * in vertical showers at the observation level and at moderate distances from the shower axis , signals in scintillation detectors are generated by electromagnetic and muon components , the integration of signals from various sources lasts over @xmath18s ; * single pulses are registered in strongly inclined showers ; they are formed strictly by muon component ; * when a shower with @xmath46 is registered , in the time - base recorded at @xmath48  m there are pulses delayed by @xmath1s ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . according to simulation , the delayed pulses are probably associated with neutron component of eas , which produces low - energy electrons studying moderation in the material of a detector and surrounding matter .",
    "this low energy electrons are registered by scintillation detectors with low thresholds ; * as a consequence , there is a possibility of registering pulses from wandering neutrons not associated with eas by widely spaced detectors ( by more than @xmath25  m ) and , thus , the increased probability of registering a false shower ."
