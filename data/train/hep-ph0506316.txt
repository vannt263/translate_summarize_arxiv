    "exclusive nonleptonic b decays have provided a fertile field to investigate the cp violation and search for new physics .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators play a key role in the study of b meson decays , but it is difficult to calculate them precisely due to the long distance qcd dynamics . the factorization approach ( fa ) @xcite based on the color transparency mechanism has been applied to many decay modes , and it works well in many channels .",
    "but it suffers from some problems such as infrared - cutoff and scale dependence . to solve these problems and make more accurate predictions , the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite , the qcd improved factorization (",
    "qcdf ) @xcite as well as the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite have been developed in the recent years .",
    "pqcd is based on @xmath6 factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "the decay amplitude is factorized into the convolution of the mesons light - cone wave functions ( see @xmath7 ) , the hard scattering kernels and the wilson coefficients , which stand for the soft , hard and harder dynamics respectively .",
    "the transverse momentum is introduced so that the endpoint singularity which will break the collinear factorization is regulated and the large double logarithm term appears after the integration on the transverse momentum , which is then resummed into the sudakov form factor .",
    "the formalism can be written as : @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath9 is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse momentum , it denotes the transverse interval of the meson .",
    "@xmath10 is the energy scale in hard function @xmath11 .",
    "the jet function @xmath12 comes from the summation of the double logarithms @xmath13 near the endpoint , called threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "the factorization theorem guarantees the infrared safety and the gauge invariance of the hard kernel and has been proved to all order of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "many hadronic two body @xmath15 decays have been studied in pqcd approach @xcite .",
    "most predictions are consistent with the current experiments .",
    "the @xmath1 decays are important to extract ckm phase angles and study the cp violation . as @xmath1 meson is not in the energy scale of the high luminosity b factories slac and kek , it is more difficult to be produced and measured now .",
    "we can study the @xmath1 decays more precisely in the very near future with the increase of luminosity at tevatron and the upcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "@xmath1 meson is different from b meson due to the heavier strange quark ( compare to @xmath16 , @xmath17 quark ) which induces the su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effect .",
    "this effect is considered to be small and the distribution amplitude of @xmath1 meson(given in the following formula ) should be similar to that of the b meson , @xmath18.\\label{bwave}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the upper limit of the @xmath19 branching ratio is @xmath20 @xcite , which constrain the parameter @xmath21 to a lower limit of about 0.5 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to fit the branching ratio measured in the @xmath22 decay @xcite , we constrain @xmath21 to about 0.55 @xcite , then we can see that the su(3 ) symmetry - breaking is not negligible . here",
    "we integrate out the variable @xmath23 and show the distribution amplitude of @xmath15 and @xmath1 meson in fig.1 .",
    "we can see that the peak point of the curve of @xmath1 meson s distribution amplitude prefers a larger @xmath24 ( @xmath24 denotes the momentum fraction carried by the light quark ) region comparing to the b meson .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the s quark much heavier than the d ( u ) quark , should carry more momentum . later in this paper",
    ", we will see that the branching ratios of @xmath1 decays are very sensitive to this parameter .",
    "if measured by experiments , radiative leptonic decays of @xmath1 meson can provide information of this parameter @xcite .",
    "= 4.0 in    in this paper , we study @xmath25 decays in the pqcd approach . hopefully the branching ratio is not too small and can be detected by the tevatron or lhcb experiments , then it may allow us to determine the @xmath1 distribution amplitude and su(3 ) breaking effects with much more precision .",
    "moreover , we can also constrain @xmath2 with fewer pollution from this channel .",
    "we use the effective hamiltonian for the process @xmath25 given by @xcite @xmath26 -v_t\\sum_{i=3}^{10}c_i(\\mu)o_i^{(q)}(\\mu)\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the wilson coefficients , and the operators are @xmath30 here i and j stand for @xmath31 color indices .    the decay width for these channels",
    "is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the 3-momentum of the final state mesons , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the decay amplitude , which will be calculated later in pqcd approach .",
    "the subscript @xmath37 denotes the helicity states of the two vector mesons with the longitudinal ( transverse ) components l(t ) . according to lorentz structure analysis",
    ", the amplitude can be decomposed into : @xmath38 we can define the longitudinal @xmath39 , transverse @xmath40 helicity amplitudes @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "they satisfy the relation @xmath43    the leading order diagrams in pqcd approach are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath44 and @xmath45are written as @xmath46 respectively , where the subscript @xmath11 denote different helicity amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the amplitudes from tree and penguin diagrams respectively .",
    "the detailed formulae of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are similar to those in @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52 @xcite , so we will not show them here .",
    "= 3.0 in    the parameters used in our calculations are : the fermi coupling constant @xmath53 , the meson masses @xmath54 @xcite , the decay constants @xmath55 @xcite , the central value of the ckm matrix elements @xmath56 , latexmath:[$|v_{td}|=0.0075,\\ |v_{tb}|=0.9992,\\    @xmath1 meson lifetime @xmath58 @xcite .    .",
    "branching ratio , polarization fraction and direct cp asymmetry dependence on @xmath21 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we mentioned before , the decay @xmath25 can be used to determine the @xmath1 meson wave function parameter @xmath21 , or @xmath21 can influence our predictions of @xmath25 decay .",
    "so we show the results in table  1 according to 3 different values of @xmath21 . from the table",
    "we can easily find out the averaged branching ratio for @xmath59 is much larger than the other two , for @xmath59 involve large wilson coefficient @xmath60 for the factorizable part while the other two ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) involve a much smaller wilson coefficient @xmath63 ( color - suppressed ) for the factorizable part of the emission diagram . as a result",
    "the first one is tree dominated and has a large branching ratio and small direct cp asymmetry .",
    "while referring to the other two , the contributions from penguin and tree diagrams are at the same order ( @xmath64 ) , hence we can expect a large direct cp asymmetry from eqs.([adircp ] ) .",
    "the polarization fraction difference of these channels are also due to that the main contribution of each channel comes from different topology .",
    "@xmath59 is tree dominated .",
    "the main contribution comes from the factorizable part of the emission diagram , where transverse polarization amplitude is suppressed by a factor @xmath65 ( see formulas in @xcite ) , so the longitudinal polarization dominates and contributes more than @xmath66 of the total branching ratio .",
    "but in @xmath61 and @xmath62 decays , tree emission ( factorizable ) diagram contribution is suppressed due to the cancellation of wilson coefficients @xmath67 .",
    "the left dominant contribution is the non - factorizable diagrams of tree operators and penguin diagrams .",
    "both of these contributions equally contribute to longitudinal and transverse polarizations .",
    "the transverse polarization is not suppressed in those cases , therefore numerically we get a small longitudinal fraction of about 0.4 .",
    "this similar situation is also found in @xmath68 decays @xcite , which are related by su(3 ) symmetry to our @xmath69 decays .",
    "= 3.0 in    to extract the cp violation parameters and dependence on ckm phase angle @xmath2 of these decays , we rewrite the helicity amplitudes in ( [ m],[barm ] ) as the functions of @xmath2 : @xmath70where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the relative strong phase between tree ( @xmath48 ) and penguin ( @xmath73 ) diagrams . here in pqcd approach , the strong phase comes from the nonfactorizable diagrams and annihilation diagrams .",
    "this is different from beneke - buchalla - neubert - sachrajda @xcite approach . in that approach ,",
    "annihilation diagrams are not taken into account , strong phases mainly come from the so - called bander - silverman - soni mechanism @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these effects are in fact next - to - leading - order ( @xmath14 suppressed ) elements and can be neglected in pqcd approach .",
    "we give the averaged branching ratios of @xmath74 and @xmath75 as a function of @xmath2 in fig.3 , and the averaged branching ratios of @xmath76 in fig.4 .",
    "= 3.0 in    using eqs.([m++],[m ] ) ,",
    "the direct cp violating parameter is @xmath77 notice the cp asymmetry for these channels are sensitive to ckm angle @xmath2 , we show the direct cp asymmetry as a function of @xmath2 in fig.5 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath78 and @xmath79 have large direct cp asymmetries up to 50% , with a relative minus sign . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath80 decay has small direct cp asymmetry due to only one large tree contribution in this decay .",
    "the uncertainty shown at this table is only from the @xmath1 meson wave function parameter dependence .",
    "in fact , since cp asymmetry is sensitive to many parameters , the line should be more broadened by uncertainties .",
    "the mixing induced cp asymmetry is complicated and requires angular distribution study , similar study may be found in @xcite .",
    "= 3.0 in    at last , if we compare our predictions with those of naive factorization @xcite @xmath81 and ones of qcdf @xcite @xmath82 we can see that they are consistent .",
    "it should be noticed that the branching ratios in fa and qcdf strongly depend on form factors . while in pqcd , the branching ratios and form factors depend on wave functions , especially the @xmath1 meson wave function .",
    "nowadays , very few @xmath1 meson decays have been measured , so we can only give rough constraints on the parameters from other channel and permit large errors .",
    "more experimental data can help to constrain the form factors and wave functions , then we can give more precise predictions and the different methods can be tested by the experiments .",
    "although similar results are got by different methods for branching ratios , the polarization fractions are quite different .",
    "the qcdf and naive factorization give only several percent transverse polarization for all three decay modes @xcite , while table 1 shows large transverse contribution for @xmath83 decays in our pqcd approach .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry are not given in ref.@xcite , but they probably also differ from pqcd approach as it happened in @xmath84 and @xmath85 case @xcite .",
    "the numerical results shown here are only leading order ones . for the tree dominated channel @xmath86 , the leading order diagrams should give the main contribution .",
    "but for the other two decays , with a branching ratio as small as @xmath87 , the next - to - leading order and power suppressed contributions should not be negligible , the results may suffer from large corrections when the next to leading order corrections are included @xcite .",
    "current experiments @xcite only give the upper limit for the decay @xmath88 more data are needed to test our calculations .",
    "in this paper we calculate the branching ratios , polarization fraction and cp asymmetries of @xmath89 modes using pqcd theorem in sm .",
    "we perform all leading order diagrams to next to leading twist wave functions .",
    "we also study the dependence of their averaged branching ratios and the cp asymmetry on the ckm angle @xmath2 .",
    "at last we compare our predictions with values from other approaches .",
