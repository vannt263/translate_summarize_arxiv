    "in this paper we deal with a spread which was discovered independently , and approximately at the same time , by d.  betten @xcite and m.  walker @xcite .",
    "betten used the concept of a _ transversal homeomorphism _ in order to describe and classify topological translation planes in terms of partitions of the vector space @xmath0 into @xmath1-dimensional subspaces . what we call the _ betten - walker spread _",
    "( bw - spread ) is described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* satz  3 ) .",
    "betten s paper contains also a short remark that the construction of this spread works also for finite fields of characteristic @xmath2 without a primitive third root of unity @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite for the connection between spreads and translation planes ; it is due to j.  andr and was found independently by r.  h.  bruck and r.  c.  bose .",
    "walker adopted the projective point of view , which leads to spreads of lines in a projective @xmath3-space .",
    "he focussed on the case of a finite ground field @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and on the _ reguli _ contained in the spread .",
    "thereby he laid the cornerstone for a concept which is now called the _ thas - walker construction_. it links spreads with _ flocks _ of quadrics via the klein mapping .",
    "the bw - spread corresponds to a flock of a quadratic cone . in the finite case",
    "this flock is due to c.  fisher and j.  a.  thas , who weakened walker s condition @xmath5 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "some authors use the term `` ftw - spread '' for a finite bw - spread .    the bw - spread and its corresponding translation plane were revisited by a.  g.  spera @xcite . the comprehensive paper by v.  jha and n.  l.  johnson @xcite ( which should be read together with its second part @xcite ) contains more information about the bw - spread and its associated flock .",
    "in both papers the existence of the bw - spread is established for an arbitrary ground field @xmath6 with characteristic @xmath2 subject to the condition that each element of @xmath6 has precisely one third root in @xmath6 .",
    "we add in passing that the bw - spread is among the `` likeable structures '' of w.  m.  kantor ; see @xcite .",
    "finally , there is a neat connection , found by j.  a.  thas , between flocks of quadratic cones over finite fields and certain _ generalized quadrangles _ ; see @xcite , @xcite , and the references given there .",
    "the infinite case was treated by f.  de  clerck and h.  van  maldeghem @xcite .",
    "however , this connection with generalized quadrangles is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "let us just add the following remark : in the finite case , the bw - spread corresponds to a generalized quadrangle discovered by w.  m.  kantor ; cf .",
    "thus some authors speak of the `` ftwkb generalized quadrangle '' in order to bring together the names of all the involved mathematicians ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "one aim of the present note is to present a short , direct , and self - contained approach to the bw - spread , thereby establishing a connection with an algebraic surface which was discovered already in the 19th century , namely _",
    "cayley s ruled cubic surface_. according to @xcite this name is not completely appropriate , since m.  chasles published his discovery of that surface in 1861 , three years before a.  cayley .",
    "our starting point is a cayley surface @xmath7 , say , in the projective @xmath3-space over an arbitrary field @xmath6 . at each simple point of @xmath7",
    "there is a unique osculating tangent other than a generator .",
    "the set of all those osculating tangents , together with one particular line on @xmath7 , gives then a set of lines , say @xmath8 , which easily turns out to be a spread if @xmath6 satisfies the conditions mentioned above ( characteristic @xmath9 , each element of @xmath6 has precisely one third root in @xmath6 ) .",
    "moreover , when `` precisely '' is replaced with `` at most '' then @xmath8 is a maximal partial spread ; see theorem  [ thm : s - eigenschaften ] and cf .",
    "* theorem  6.3 ) . by our approach",
    "the maximality of such a partial spread follows from the observation that all points of a distinguished plane are incident with a line of the partial spread .    by a classical result",
    ", there exists a duality which maps the cayley surface ( as a set of points ) onto the set of its tangent planes .",
    "any mapping of this kind fixes @xmath8 , as a set of lines .",
    "therefore , all our results hold together with their dual counterparts .",
    "so , depending on the ground field , @xmath8 will be a ( maximal partial ) spread and at the same time a ( maximal partial ) dual spread .    in case of characteristic three",
    "there is a _ line of nuclei _ for the cayley surface .",
    "the existence of that line was noted by m.  de  finis and m.  j.  de  resmini @xcite without giving a geometric interpretation .",
    "we show in theorem  [ thm : par.netz ] that the line of nuclei is the axis of a parabolic congruence which contains all lines of @xmath8 .",
    "the transversal homeomorphism used in @xcite to describe the bw - spread is given in terms of polynomial functions .",
    "this raises the question whether or not the bw - spread is _ algebraic _ , i.e. , its image under the klein mapping is an algebraic variety . in the finite case",
    "every set of points is an algebraic variety ( by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3.5  ( a ) ) , even a hypersurface ) , whence we exclude that case from our investigation . on the other hand ,",
    "infinite algebraic spreads seem to be rare .",
    "the only examples known to the authors are the regular spreads ( or , in other words , the elliptic linear congruences ) and some spreads found by the second author ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , our hope to find another example of an algebraic spread did not come true .",
    "however , the bw - spread is very close to being algebraic .",
    "we establish in theorem  [ thm : algebraisch ] that the union of the bw - spread and one pencil of lines is algebraic .",
    "more precisely , the klein image of that set is the smallest algebraic variety containing the klein image of the bw - spread ( theorem  [ thm : abgeschlossen ] ) . when looking for equations describing that variety ( in terms of plcker coordinates ) the thesis of r.  koch @xcite turned out extremely useful , even though we could not directly implement his results in our work .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the bw - spread ( over @xmath10 ) is ubiquitous in koch s thesis under the german name `` schmiegtangentenkongruenz '' ( congruence of osculating tangents ) , but the property of being a spread never seems to be mentioned in the text . likewise ,",
    "the authors were unable to find a remark on this property in the older literature on the cayley surface .",
    "we consider the three - dimensional projective space @xmath11 over a commutative field @xmath6 . as we shall use column vectors , a point has the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "the set of lines of @xmath11 is written as @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a family of independent indeterminates over @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for those basic notions of algebraic geometry which will be used in this paper . however , in contrast to @xcite , we write @xmath16 for the set of @xmath6-rational points of the variety given by homogeneous polynomials @xmath17 $ ] .    each matrix @xmath18 acts on the column space @xmath19 by multiplication from the left hand side and therefore as a projective collineation on @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 acts as a @xmath6-algebra isomorphism on @xmath21 $ ] via @xmath22 for @xmath23 . given a form",
