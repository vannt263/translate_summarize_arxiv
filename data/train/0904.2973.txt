    "the study of high - energy particle jets in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions provides access to the properties of the dense medium formed in such reactions .",
    "in contrast to the situation in elementary collisions , the hard - scattered partons have to traverse the surrounding strongly interacting matter which leads to significant energy loss and to a modification of the final state particle jet  @xcite .",
    "particularly strong energy loss of the parton in the medium is expected if the matter is deconfined and has free color charge carriers .",
    "this may lead to a significant suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) hadrons compared to expectations based on perturbative qcd , if a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been formed .",
    "furthermore , the energy which has been radiated off the parton prior to hadronization may lead to enhanced soft particle production in the angular vicinity of the parton .",
    "possible mechanisms like cerenkov gluon radiation  @xcite , shock wave formation  @xcite and large angle gluon radiation  @xcite have been discussed .    a strong suppression of high-@xmath0 hadrons in au - au collisions at",
    "@xmath3  gev compared to p - p has been reported  @xcite .",
    "similarly , early studies of azimuthal correlations revealed a significant reduction of the di - jet over jet rate in such collisions which became manifest in a dramatic disappearance of the back - to - back correlation to a high-@xmath0 trigger particle  @xcite .",
    "these observations have been interpreted as a strong indication for the formation of a dense colored medium in nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "pioneering studies of two - pion correlations at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) have indicated a significant broadening of the back - to - back correlation in pb - au at @xmath4  gev but no disappearance  @xcite .",
    "a very similar broadening has also been observed at rhic  @xcite when the analysis was extended to lower transverse momentum , where the back - to - back correlation exhibits a double - humped structure with a local minimum around @xmath5 .",
    "these findings have been connected to strong final state interactions of the hard - scattered parton with the matter , indicating the occurence of significant energy transfer from the parton to the medium .",
    "final conclusions on the relevant mechanisms at work , however , have not yet been drawn , and more conventional scenarios like jet - redirection through multiple scattering have not yet been ruled out . in this letter , we present results of a two - particle correlation analysis in pb - au collisions at 158  @xmath1  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "these data represent a high - statistics measurement of jet - like particle correlations at @xmath4  gev which , in addition to existing results at higher collision energy , may help to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of jet modifications by means of a systematic energy scan .",
    "the data were recorded with the ceres experiment at the cern - sps . in 1998 ,",
    "the spectrometer was upgraded by a cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) with radial drift field , matching the spectrometer acceptance in pseudorapidity @xmath6 , and with full coverage in azimuth  @xcite .",
    "the tpc is hence ideally suited for studies of azimuthal correlations in the mid - rapidity region of heavy - ion collisions at 158@xmath1  gev/@xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "charged particle momenta can be reconstructed from the track curvature in the magnetic field .",
    "measurement of the particle trajectories in up to 20 planes along the beam direction results in a momentum resolution of @xmath8 , with @xmath9 in gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the present analysis is based on @xmath10 pb - au collisions recorded with the tpc in the year 2000 .",
    "the event sample is analyzed in three bins of centrality ( 0 - 5% , 5 - 10% , and 10 - 20% of the most central of the total geometric cross section @xmath11 , respectively ) .",
    "the centrality is determined via the multiplicity of charged particles measured in the tpc and a telescope of silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) close to the target  @xcite .",
    "the charged particle tracks used for this analysis are selected from the polar angle range @xmath12 . to provide sufficient momentum resolution ,",
    "the tracks are required to have at least 12 out of 20 possible points used in the momentum fit .",
    "the accepted tracks are subdivided into a trigger and an associate sample , based on the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the tracks . in a given event ,",
    "the trigger is the particle of highest transverse momentum within the trigger @xmath0 range . except for the study of the transverse momentum dependence ,",
    "we choose trigger @xmath13 and associate @xmath14 particles in the ranges @xmath15  gev/@xmath2 and @xmath16  gev/@xmath2 , respectively . using this selection ,",
    "the overall number of events , trigger particles and associated particles per trigger in the different centrality classes are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the single track efficiency for this set of cuts has been determined by a monte carlo procedure where simulated tracks were embedded into real data events .",
    "this method provides a detailed simulation of the tpc response to charged particles in a realistic track density environment .",
    "the efficiency was found to be @xmath17 for particles with @xmath18  gev/@xmath2 , with no significant dependence on rapidity , transverse momentum and charge of the particle .    within the same monte carlo study ,",
    "the momentum resolution was determined as function of the polar angle @xmath19 , the number of fitted points in the tpc , the transverse momentum , and the charge of the particle . for typical trigger and associate ranges ( @xmath15  gev/@xmath2 and @xmath16  gev/@xmath2 ) as used in this analysis , the mean transverse momentum of trigger and associated particles is @xmath20  gev/@xmath2 and @xmath21  gev/@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the typical transverse momentum resolution is @xmath22 for the trigger particles and @xmath23 for associated particles .",
    "the resolution of the azimuthal and polar angles is better than 3  mrad and 1  mrad , respectively , for particles with @xmath24  gev/@xmath2 and hence negligible for the shape and magnitude of the angular correlations presented in this study .",
    "the limited efficiency to reconstruct two tracks with small angular separation was studied by dividing the distribution of opening angles of pairs from the same event by a reference distribution obtained by combining particles from different events . for opening angles greater than 15",

    "correlations arising due to slight non - uniformities of the single - track acceptance are accounted for by division by a mixed - event distribution @xmath30 , where trigger and associated particles are taken from different events of the same centrality class . to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the background distribution ,",
    "ten events were mixed for each signal event .",
    "the normalized correlation function @xmath31 contains physical correlations from jets as well as azimuthal anisotropies due to the finite impact parameter of the collision . to separate the jet - like correlations from the bulk anisotropies known as elliptic flow",
    ", we assume that each particle pair can be attributed to either of the two contributions .",
    "in this two - source approach the correlation function is decomposed into the jet - like contribution @xmath32 and a contribution arising due to elliptic flow , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the average elliptic flow coefficients determined in the trigger and associate @xmath0 range , respectively . assuming that the jet yield vanishes at its minimum ( the zyam assumption  @xcite ) , the elliptic flow contribution is adjusted by variation of @xmath36 to a polynomial fit of @xmath37 and subtracted .",
    "the polynomial fit of @xmath37 is used in order to be less sensitive to point - by - point fluctuations of the correlation function .",
    "we obtain the conditional yield @xmath38 as the number of jet - associated particles per trigger : @xmath39 where @xmath26 and @xmath40 are the total numbers of triggers and associates , and @xmath41 is the number of jet - associated particles with the trigger after subtraction of the flow - modulated background .",

    "the analysis has been performed for all charged particles , as well as for positively or negatively charged particles only .",
    "auto - correlations have been removed by exclusion of particle @xmath42 from the reaction plane calculation . in events with jets , however , particles are clustered and the reaction plane could be biased to the jet axis even after removal of particle @xmath42 from the reaction plane calculation . to study the impact of this potential bias , separate analyses have been performed for events with and without a trigger particle .",
    "in addition , the results of the triggered events have been compared to an analysis where only particles with @xmath43  gev/@xmath2 have been used for the calculation of the reaction plane . in all cases , the extracted flow coefficients after correction for the resolution of the reaction plane agree within their statistical uncertainties .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the correlation function @xmath37 and the estimated contribution from elliptic flow in three different bins of collision centrality .",
    "the blue and red lines indicate the uncertainty arising from the systematic error of the @xmath44 coefficients which are about 10% and 25% in the associate and trigger @xmath0 range , respectively .",

    "we observe qualitative agreement with these rhic results , in particular with respect to the shapes of the near- and away - side distributions .",
    "quantitatively , a weaker near - side correlation is observed at sps , which can be explained by a lower average jet energy at a given trigger threshold .",
    "for the same reason , the away - to - near - side yield ratio at sps is larger than at rhic .",
    "the latter observation is also in agreement with the expectation of a larger di - jet to mono - jet rate at sps in the acceptance , since a given trigger threshold biases the measurement towards larger @xmath49 at lower beam energy , and hence to more symmetric parton - parton collisions around mid - rapidity .",

    "we observe that the spectrum at the near - side is significantly steeper than at the away - side for @xmath54  gev/@xmath2 , independent of the trigger @xmath0 .",
    "such behaviour can be explained by the requirement of a hard trigger , which , biasing the fragmentation , softens the observed spectrum of associated particles at the near - side , whereas the away - side spectrum remains unbiased .",
    "similar softening is observed in calculations using the pythia event generator  @xcite , corroborating the fragmentation picture at the near - side . in detail , the measured @xmath0 dependence of this effect reveals distinct differences to pythia .",

    "all charge combinations show a narrow , jet - like peak at the near - side and a broad structure at the away - side , with a pronounced dip around @xmath5 for the unlike - sign charge combinations .",
    "moreover , we observe dramatic differences of the relative yields . at the near - side , unlike - sign combinations are more abundant than like - sign combinations with the same trigger charge .",
    "this is in agreement with local charge conservation in the jet fragmentation process . at the away - side ,",
    "positive associates are more abundant than negative ones , for both trigger charges .",
    "this asymmetry is also observed in pythia and characterizes hard scattering at sps energies as being dominated by large-@xmath57 partons , hence reflecting the positive net charge of valence quarks .",

    "[ fig4 ] . as a reference for vacuum fragmentation , we calculate these ratios with pythia . to this end , calculations of p - p , n - n , p - n , and n - p collisions have been properly weighted according to their occurence in pb - au collisions , assuming binary collision scaling . on the near - side ,",
    "the pythia calculations match very well the observed ratios @xmath58 for negative and positive triggers , as seen in the upper panel in fig .",
    "this supports the view that the near - side correlations are characterized by vacuum fragmentation of jets .",
    "at the away - side , we compare our results also to the inclusive charge ratio of bulk hadrons @xmath67 in the associate @xmath0 range , indicated by the shaded band in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for positive triggers ,",
    "the observed ratio @xmath58 is a factor three smaller than the pythia calculation .",
    "remarkably , the measurement is much closer to the medium charge ratio , suggesting that the jet energy has been transfered to the medium prior to hadronization .",
    "incidentally , the pythia prediction coincides with the medium charge ratio for negative trigger particles , thus allowing no discrimination between vacuum fragmentation and energy deposition to the medium .",

    "we observe a significant dip of the two - particle yield at @xmath5 , which is most pronounced for unlike - sign charge combinations .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum of associated particles at the near - side is softer than at the away - side , in accordance with the expectation of a trigger bias and in qualitative agreement with pythia .",
    "however , a more detailed comparison to pythia discloses an excess of soft particles ( @xmath69  gev/@xmath2 ) on the away - side and suggests it is created in response to the energy deposition of the hard - scattered parton .",
    "the study of the charge dependence of the two - particle yield and a comparison to pythia reveals that the near - side correlation , in particular its charge composition , is clearly jet - like .",
    "in contrast , the away - side charge composition is inconsistent with vacuum fragmentation represented by pythia .",
    "it is , however , in agreement with the bulk charge composition in this @xmath0 range , suggesting that the correlated particles do not stem from fragmentation directly but emerge due to a local energy deposition of the parton , implying a medium - modified fragmentation function .",
    "in essence , the present data demonstrate that jet properties in nucleus - nucleus collisions are modified at sps energies , indicating that also at these energies matter of considerable opaqueness is created .",
    "the charge composition and transverse momentum dependence of the away - side yield are consistent with a scenario including significant energy transfer of the parton to the medium .",
