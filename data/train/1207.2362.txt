    "one of the most motivated extensions , from a theoretical point of view , of the standard model ( sm ) and minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) of particle physics is obtained by enlarging the gauge group of the theory by admitting extra @xmath1 s .",
    "such extensions are natural at low energy for models coming from grand unified theories and string theories ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the string",
    "inspired scenarios the anomalies of the extra @xmath1 s are cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "to explore such possibility we will use an extension of the mssm which from now on will be dubbed miaumssm .",
    "an alternative version of this model which admits spontaneous supersymmetry breaking was also formulated in @xcite , but in this work we will use the original formulation of @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the miaumssm has been investigated in different directions .",
    "assuming that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , a candidate for dark matter , comes from the anomalous sector of the model @xcite , the relic density of such lsp was computed and proved to be compatible with the experimental data of wmap @xcite .",
    "furthermore in @xcite the decays of the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) into the lsp has been considered , while in @xcite the features of a possible signature of the model at lhc has been considered by concentrating on a particular radiative decay of the nlsp .",
    "+ in this paper we will further develop the phenomenology of the miaumssm by computing the forward - backward asymmetry which is induced in the final states of the process @xmath0 by keeping into account the new gauge boson , @xmath2 , associated to the extra @xmath1 gauge symmetry . the couplings ( charges ) of this particle to the others present in our model are not fixed by the requirement of gauge anomaly cancellation and can be determined only by experiment .",
    "our aim is to show that such measurement is feasible and that it can distinguish among the different possible scenarios @xcite . since at lhc",
    "the colliding beams are made of the same particle , to generate an asymmetry in the final state , some cuts on the parameter space have to be necessarily performed .",
    "each possible cut leads to a different definition of the asymmetry . in this work",
    "we will use four different sets of cuts to show that our results are not dependent from these choices . +",
    "this work is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the main features of the model which we are going to study . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we will discuss the four different definitions of the asymmetry we will use : in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we will describe our calculations and collect the results which are finally discussed in the conclusions .",
    "our model @xcite is an extension of the mssm with an extra @xmath1 .",
    "the charges of the matter fields with respect to the symmetry groups are given in table 1 .",
