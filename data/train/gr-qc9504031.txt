    "over the past forty years , black - hole physics has become quite a mature field @xcite . driven by a desire to understand their fundamental properties and potential importance to astrophysics ,",
    "the study of black holes has produced a number of outstanding results .",
    "for example , hawking has proven that black holes never bifurcate and that the areas of black - hole event horizons never decrease to the future @xcite .",
    "further , through the efforts of a number of researchers , the black hole `` no - hair '' theorems @xcite have established that stationary electrovacuum black holes are far simpler objects than were once imagined @xcite . in all of these studies ,",
    "the interiors of black holes have been entirely ignored , as well they should as these regions neither affect nor are observable from the asymptotic region of the spacetime ( by their very definition ) .",
    "so , while a great deal has been learned about black - hole exteriors , comparatively little is known about black - hole interiors .",
    "are there any features that black - hole interiors share ? there are at least two results in this direction . first , penrose has shown that if a spacetime contains a future trapped surface then , provided the cosmic censorship hypothesis holds @xcite , it must lie within the black - hole region and that such a spacetime must be singular in the sense that it can not be future null geodesically complete @xcite . while a truly amazing and important theorem in the history of black - hole physics , it tells us very little about the extent to which the spacetime is singular . are just a few , most , or all of the geodesics in the interior region incomplete ?",
    "how long does it take for such a singularity to develop ?",
    "second , a number of people using a variety of methods ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , have examined whether the cauchy horizons that occur in the interiors of the kerr - newman black holes will be present in more `` realistic '' spacetimes . in particular , poisson and israel have argued that these horizons are destroyed ( generically ) due to an unbounded `` inflation '' of the mass function @xmath4 on what was the cauchy horizon inside the black hole @xcite . although arguments have been given that indicate that these results are quite general , a proof remains to be found @xcite .    here ,",
    "in the effort to explore the features of black - hole interiors , we examine a single issue : how long can the journey of an observer in a black hole last ?",
    "must it be finite ?",
    "if so , can an upper bound on the length of such a journey be given in terms of some characteristic of the black hole ?",
    "it turns out that there are two forms of this problem that are best considered separately .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves with observers that enter a black hole from the asymptotic region . that is , we are restricting our attention to the portion of a black - hole region lying to the future of past null infinity @xmath5 .",
    "second , we drop this restriction and look at the entire black - hole region .",
    "however , we shall see that this generalization does come at a small price .",
    "a restriction on the cauchy surface topology is necessary ( while none appears necessary for the first case ) along with a weaker bound on the lifetimes of observers within the black - hole region .",
    "consider first the case of an observer entering a black hole from an asymptotic region @xcite @xmath6 also known as the domain of outer communications @xcite . in the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime , this is region ii depicted in fig .",
    "[ schwarz1 ] . a partial answer to our problem can obtained from the work of friedman , schleich , and witt which can be stated as : in an asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the null - convergence condition @xcite with distinct null infinities @xmath7 , the sets @xmath8 are empty for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore , fixing one null infinity @xmath10 it is impossible for an observer to leave the asymptotic region @xmath11 by entering a black hole and then live indefinitely by escaping to another asymptotic region .",
    "the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime depicted in fig .",
    "[ schwarz1 ] exemplifies this impossibility .",
    "although this result is very encouraging , it does not eliminate other possibilities for an observer existing indefinitely within a black hole .",
    "based on the general considerations presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulating ] and its successful proof in the spherically symmetric case ( theorem  1 below ) , we conjecture that this result can indeed be strengthened .    _ conjecture 1 . _",
    "fix a globally hyperbolic asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the dominant - energy and non - negative - pressures conditions @xcite with a non - empty black - hole region .",
    "fix a connected component @xmath12 of the event horizon and denote the supremum of its area as measured over the set of all of its spatial cross - sections by @xmath13 .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath14 ( independent of which spacetime and event horizon is chosen ) such that the lifetime of any observer within the black hole is bounded above by @xmath15 provided that the black hole is entered by crossing @xmath12 in the future of @xmath16 .",
    "recall that the irreducible mass associated with a connected component of black - hole s event horizon at a given `` time '' is obtained by calculating its surface area @xmath1 on a spatial cross - section and setting @xcite @xmath17 the quantity is `` irreducible '' as it is non - decreasing to future , which follows from the fact that the area @xmath1 of the event horizon is non - decreasing to the future @xcite .",
    "so , with this definition , conjecture  1 bounds the lifetime of observers within a black hole by a multiple of the supremum of the irreducible mass calculated on the black - hole s event horizon ( provided the black hole is entered from the asymptotic region ) .    to explore the features of conjecture  1 ,",
    "consider a black - hole spacetime associated with two distant stars that each collapses forming black holes .",
    "should these two black holes never collide with one another , the event horizon will then have two connected components and conjecture  1 asserts that the lifetime of an observer that enters one of the black holes ( to the future of @xmath16 ) is bounded by a quantity computable from the geometry of the event horizon of the black hole entered .",
    "however , should the two black holes collide and coalesce into a single black hole , the event horizon will then have a single connected component . in this case , the bound given by conjecture  1 is insensitive as to whether the black hole was entered before or after coalescence and to which black hole was entered .",
    "so , the bound is the same for observers entering a small black hole and a large black hole as long as the two eventually coalesce .",
    "this is probably a gross overestimate in the case of an observer entering the smaller black hole before coalescence and probably can be refined .    next , suppose we slightly modify conjecture  1 by having it place a bound on the lifetime of observers in the portion of the black hole lying to the future of @xmath16 .",
    "fix any two points @xmath18 and @xmath19 in this region with @xmath20 and fix any causal curve @xmath21 from @xmath16 to @xmath18 . then , as @xmath21 must intersect the event horizon somewhere , conjecture  1 gives an upper bound on the lengths of all causal curves from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( that is independent of @xmath18 of @xmath19 ) , thereby bounding the lifetimes of all observers in this region .",
    "however , suppose that the black hole is sufficiently complicated that its boundary ( part if not all of the total event horizon ) is not connected .",
    "for example , we could imagine a spacetime containing a wormhole with its mouths sufficiently separated and moving in such a way that the event horizons enclosing each mouth never coalesce .",
    "then , if @xmath18 can be reached from @xmath16 by two causal curves that intersect different horizons ( i.e. , thread different mouths ) , we would have a choice of which component to use in establishing an upper bound to the lifetimes of observers therein .",
    "can we use the smaller of the two , or must we always use the larger ? or should we use a bound based on total area of the event horizons associated with our region ?",
    "we leave this problem open for investigation .    in conjecture  1 ,",
    "we have limited ourselves to observers entering a black hole from an asymptotic region .",
    "might the bound given by conjecture  1 hold for all observers within a given black hole ?",
    "clearly not , if we do not put some restriction on the cauchy surface topology as the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime provides a simple counterexample . here",
    ", the problem is that there as an entire asymptotic region within the black hole .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ schwarz1 ] . )   even if we restrict our consideration to spacetimes with cauchy surfaces having the topology of a compact orientable connected three - manifold @xmath22 minus a point ( so that there are no other asymptotic regions to escape to ) then , as is demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : topology ] , if we do not further restrict @xmath22 , asymptotically flat black - hole spacetimes can be constructed with `` compact internal regions '' and yet admitting infinitely long timelike curves in the black - hole region .",
    "furthermore , as is demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulating ] , even if we restrict ourselves to spacetimes with @xmath0 cauchy surfaces , there is no @xmath14 for which the bound given by conjecture  1 will hold . however , here the only problem appears to be that the bound is not quite appropriate .",
    "the idea is that the bound in conjecture  1 is constructed from the geometry of the event horizon and therefore can be calculated without a knowledge of the interior of the black hole . for more general observers ,",
    "a knowledge of the interior geometry ( at least on a cauchy surface ) is necessary in obtaining a bound on the lifetimes of observers therein .",
    "based on these considerations and its successful proof in the spherically symmetric case ( theorem  2 below ) , we are led to the following conjecture .",
    "_ conjecture 2 .",
    "_ fix a globally hyperbolic asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the dominant - energy and non - negative - pressures conditions @xcite . then , provided the cauchy surfaces are diffeomorphic to @xmath0 , there is a number @xmath14 ( independent of which spacetime is chosen ) and a quantity @xmath23 computable from the initial data on a cauchy surface @xmath24 , such that the lifetimes of all observers within the black - hole region is bounded above by @xmath25 .    in this conjecture , @xmath23 is intended to represent the least upper bound to a quasilocal mass function ( associating a number with each given spacelike two - sphere in a spacetime ) over the set of all two - spheres in @xmath24 . as we have not specified",
    "what quasilocal mass function is to be used ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) , this portion of the conjecture is imprecise and we leave the task of making it precise as part of the problem .",
    "however , when we specialize to the spherically symmetric spacetimes , we expect this mass to be simply @xmath26 , where @xmath4 is the mass function constructible in any spherically symmetric spacetime as given by eq .",
    "( [ defm ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : elementaries ] .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have limited the cauchy surface topology in conjecture  2 to @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : topology ] , we generalize this conjecture by broadening the class of spatial topologies .",
    "furthermore , a theorem is presented which states ( roughly ) that the lengths of causal curves in the portion of the black hole not reachable from the asymptotic region are bounded provided the spacetime admits a maximal cauchy surface .",
    "although this is far from a proof of conjecture  2 , it is encouraging .",
    "as the calculation of @xmath13 in conjecture  1 requires a knowledge of the geometry of spacetime in the far future ( and therefore can be quite difficult to calculate in practice ) one might worry that @xmath13 could be arbitrarily large ( or even infinite ) thereby making the bound given by conjecture  1 rather weak .",
    "however , from an analysis of the spherically symmetric case ( see theorem a1 in appendix  a ) , we expect the three masses @xmath27 , @xmath2 , and @xmath23 to be related according to the following inequalities @xmath28 whether the second inequality actually holds can not be investigated until @xmath23 is given a precise definition . however",
    ", since the total area @xmath29 of the black hole at a given `` time '' is the sum of the areas associated with each connected component , the first inequality always holds provided that @xmath30 .",
    "( this inequality is similar to , though distinct from , the gibbons - penrose isoperimetric inequality for initial data sets in general relativity which has its inspiration from this inequality @xcite . )  that such an inequality should hold can be argued as follows .",
    "consider this inequality in an asymptotically flat electrovacuum spacetime whose event horizon is connected ( i.e. , so there is only one black hole at late times ) .",
    "as the area of the event horizon is non - decreasing to the future , this inequality is most difficult to satisfy at late times .",
    "however , it is expected that the black hole will eventually settle - down and approach a stationary state which , by the `` no - hair '' theorems , must be one of the kerr - newman spacetimes where it is known that the inequality does indeed hold .",
    "( as far as the author is aware , whether this inequality always holds is unresolved .",
    "theorem  a1 in appendix  a proves it does hold for the spherically symmetric spacetime satisfying the dominant - energy condition . )",
    "therefore , should the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ mass_ineq ] ) indeed hold , then the bound given by conjecture  1 will always be finite . furthermore , independent of this inequality , an alternate version of conjecture  1 can be obtained by replacing the bound by @xmath31 .",
    "should the irreducible mass always be bounded by the adm mass ( as expected ) , then conjecture  1 would imply this alternate version .",
    "conjectures  1 and  2 are similar to the conjecture that closed universes possessing @xmath32 or @xmath33 cauchy surfaces ( and obeying the dominant - energy and non - negative - pressures conditions ) must have finite lifetimes @xcite , which is a slight variant of the closed - universe recollapse conjecture @xcite .",
    "in fact , the similarity is more than superficial .",
    "the idea is that the requirement that the cauchy surfaces be compact in the closed - universe finite lifetime conjecture can probably be replaced by the more general requirement that the geometry on cauchy surfaces be bounded in an appropriate sense . in the spherically symmetric case",
    "we can make this precise .",
    "if we replace the requirement that the cauchy surfaces be compact with bounds on @xmath34 and @xmath4 , we can again establish a finite lifetime for the spacetime .",
    "( actually , if this is done , the final bound on the lifetime may be slightly different from that stated in ref .  @xcite . )  with this in mind , consider the collapse of a star leading to the formation of a black hole as depicted in fig .  [ collapse ] .",
    "the black - hole region @xmath35 of this spacetime is globally hyperbolic with its boundary @xmath36 ( the event horizon of the black hole ) acting as a cauchy surface for this region .",
    "although @xmath37 is non - compact it does enjoy the property that the geometry thereon is essentially bounded .",
    "in particular , the area of the black hole ( as measured on the event horizon ) is bounded by its future asymptotic value .",
    "therefore , it would seem that proofs of these two conjectures would be very similar and that one could be obtained from the other with only slight modifications being required . indeed , a proof of conjectures  1  and  2 for the spherically symmetric case can be obtained using the techniques developed in the course of the proof that spherically symmetric closed universes have finite lifetimes . in fact , we prove somewhat more .",
    "_ theorem 1 .",
    "_ fix a globally hyperbolic asymptotically flat spherically symmetric spacetime satisfying the dominant - energy and non - negative - pressures conditions @xcite and possessing a cauchy surface that is geodesically complete .",

    "a , provided the dominant - energy condition holds , for spheres on the event horizon @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath42 on the event horizon is always bounded above by @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , the bound in theorem  1 can always be replaced by @xmath44 thereby given a bound that is calculable from the initial data on a cauchy surface .",
    "further , provided that the event horizon is complete in the sense given by theorem  a2 in appendix  a , then @xmath45 and @xmath4 have the same future asymptotic limits on the event horizon .",
    "therefore , in this case , the bound in theorem  1 is equivalent to @xmath46 times the future asymptotic value of the mass @xmath4 on the event horizon .",
    "each part of theorem  1 has its own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "part ( a ) of this theorem is best used when we know that the observer is entering the black hole from the asymptotic region . however , suppose we are given the location of an observer on a ( spherically symmetric ) initial data surface @xmath24 ( a cauchy surface ) and that he enters the black hole .",
    "do we need to find the rest of the spacetime from the initial data on @xmath24 to find out whether the observer was indeed in the asymptotic region ?",
    "if @xmath39 is outgoing on all of @xmath24 , then by ( b ) the length of his ( and indeed all observers ) journey in the black hole is bounded by a multiple of the future asymptotic irreducible mass of the black hole . however , suppose that @xmath39 is not outgoing on all of @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath24 contains a future or past outer trapped surface ) .",
    "then , provided our observer begins his journey on the portion of @xmath24 connected to @xmath40 on which @xmath39 is outgoing , then , by ( c ) , his lifetime within the black hole is still bounded by a multiple of the future asymptotic irreducible mass of the black hole .    in theorem  1 , we have demanded that the spacetime admit a cauchy surface that is geodesically complete .",
    "this is automatically satisfied by asymptotically flat cauchy surfaces with @xmath0 topology , but not may not be satisfied by those with @xmath47 topology .",
    "we make this requirement as it guarantees that @xmath4 will be everywhere non - negative , which is needed for the method of proof used herein ( see lemma  1 ) .",
    "it is likely , though not for certain , that the proof can be improved upon , allowing us to lift the requirement that a cauchy surface be complete .",
    "the next theorem gives an upper bound on the lifetimes of observers within the black - hole region of a spherically symmetric spacetime that makes no requirements on how the black hole was entered nor on how @xmath39 behaves on a cauchy surface .",
    "note that the price for this is that a restriction on the cauchy topology is necessary and that the bound need not be as tight as that given by theorem  1 .",
    "_ theorem 2 .",
    "_ fix an asymptotically flat spherically symmetric spacetime that possesses @xmath0 cauchy surfaces and that satisfies the dominant - energy and non - negative - pressures conditions @xcite . then , for any cauchy surface @xmath24 , the lifetime of an observer in the black - hole region @xmath35 with event horizon @xmath48 is bounded above by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the subset of @xmath24 on which @xmath39 is past - directed timelike , past - directed null , or zero .",
    "to understand the features of the bound given by theorem  2 , consider the black hole formed by the collapse of a spherical star from a state that is benign in the sense that on a spherically symmetric cauchy surface @xmath24 there are no future or past outer trapped surfaces ( so in particular @xmath39 is outgoing everywhere thereon ) .",
    "then , @xmath50 is empty , the maximum of @xmath4 on @xmath51 occurs on its boundary ( which lies on @xmath37 ) where it is no greater than @xmath27 .",
    "so , in this case , theorem  2 reproduces the bound given by part ( b ) of theorem  1 .",
    "if , however , the spacetime contains no such cauchy surface ( see for example the black - hole spacetime given by fig .",
    "[ db2 ] ) , then @xmath52 can be larger than @xmath53 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulating ] , this larger bound is necessary .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath54 is a subset of @xmath55 , this quantity is constructed from the geometry on the portion of @xmath24 that is not in the asymptotic region .",

    "the bound given by theorem  1 has the feature that it increases as matter flows through the event horizon into the black hole thereby making it larger .",

    "lastly , our units are such that @xmath65 .",
    "an observer beginning a journey from the asymptotic region of a maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime of positive mass @xmath66 ( region i in fig .  [ schwarz1 ] ) into the black hole ( regions ii and iv ) must enter region ii .",
    "as is well known , this journey within the black hole must end in a time no greater than @xmath67 as the observer will be crushed as he approaches the singularity within .",
    "does a similar result hold more generally ? consider the following conjecture",
    ".    _ conjecture 3 ( false ) .",
    "_ there is a constant @xmath14 such that the lifetime of any observer in a black hole of mass @xmath66 is no greater than @xmath68 .",

    "however , that such a journey can be achieved is perhaps not surprising once we realize that the observer , having gone outside of the domain of dependence of @xmath24 , is in a region that is unpredictable ( from the initial data on @xmath24 ) .",
    "it has been conjectured ( the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite ) and investigations have indicated that such cauchy horizons do not occur for `` realistic '' spacetimes @xcite .",
    "so , while a few spacetimes will have such horizons beyond which the journey of an observer could continue ( such as kerr - newman with @xmath72 ) this will usually not be the case as the spacetime will become sufficiently singular that the journey will be inextendible .",

    "then , as the two spacetimes share the same causal structure and agree outside the black - hole region of schwarzschild , the share the same black - hole region .",
    "by choosing the conformal factor appropriately , we can quite easily ensure the existence of arbitrarily long timelike curves in the black - hole region ( in particular , region ii ) .",
    "we conjecture that spacetimes with `` ordinary '' matter do not exhibit this type of behavior .",
    "just what restrictions on the matter content is appropriate is an issue for investigation , however , in conjectures  1 and  2 we have imposed the dominant - energy and non - negative - pressures conditions @xcite .",

    "further , in conjecture  3 there is no restriction on how the observer enters the black hole .",
    "this is important as the black - hole region associated with the asymptotic region i of schwarzschild is all of regions ii and iv in fig .  [ schwarz1 ] .",
    "in particular the other asymptotic end is inside the black hole ( with our definition of black hole ) .",
    "so , clearly there are infinitely long lived observers therein .",
    "we need some type of condition to rule out this and similar counterexamples .",
    "is it enough to restrict ourselves to observers that begin their journey from outside the black hole ?",
    "consider an observer that begins his journey in region iii .",
    "while initially outside the black hole , he can go inside and reach the other asymptotic region and thereby live forever .",
    "however , an observer that begins in the asymptotic portion , region i , must enter region ii upon entering the black hole wherein his lifetime must end in a finite time .",
    "so , one way to take care of this problem is to restrict ourselves to observers who enter the black hole from `` sufficiently far away '' .",

    "first , while it may be possible to increase the amount of time an observer can possibly exist within a black hole , it may just be that none of this increase is available to the observer that is _ already _ within the black - hole region .",
    "that is , while we expect that observers can exist longer in larger black holes ( as is certainly true for vacuum schwarzschild black holes ) , and it is true that by throwing in matter we can increase the amount of time an observer has spent within a black hole ( by making the black hole larger , which is related to our next point ) , it may be that an observer still can not live any longer than he would have otherwise .",
    "second , the very notion of a black hole is a nonlocal concept requiring a knowledge of the entire future history for its determination .",
    "for example , while the spacetime corresponding to a static spherically symmetric shell of matter with a flat interior has no black - hole region , if we choose to `` turn off '' the pressure that keeps the shell from collapsing inwards , the new spacetime will possess a nonempty black - hole region .",
    "so , while under one evolution an observer may begin his journey outside of the black - hole region , in another he may already be within this region .",
    "third , the manipulation of matter is a delicate issue in general relativity .",
    "we can not move matter around as we like , e.g. , pulling two stars together or pushing them apart .",
    "the pushing and pulling involve stresses that must be taken into account as demanded by einstein s theory of gravity .    to take care of these subtleties",

    "@xmath24 is a three - manifold ( physically the spacetime at an `` instant '' ) , @xmath307 is a riemannian metric on @xmath24 ( physically the metric induced from the spacetime metric @xmath186 ) , and @xmath138 is a symmetric tensor on @xmath24 ( physically the extrinsic curvature of @xmath24 in @xmath66 ) .",

    "( 10.2.41 ) and  ( 10.2.42 ) of ref .  @xcite . )",

    "( in the terminology of geroch @xcite , without restrictions , we can _ build _ any initial data set from any other initial data set . )",
    "it is worth noting that when we restrict ourselves to spacetimes satisfying the dominant - energy condition , if the initial data is vacuum in the sense that the associated energy and mass - current densities ( which can be calculated using the initial - value constraint equations of general relativity ) , then a possible evolution of @xmath305 is everywhere vacuum and therefore is unique ( up to diffeomorphisms ) .",
    "more generally , however , there will be many possible evolutions of a given initial data set .    from a possible evolution of @xmath305 , we can calculate the least upper bound to the lengths of causal curves having past endpoint @xmath18 . by looking at this least upper bound over the set of all possible evolutions , we can find which possible evolution gives our observer the longest possible lifetime . if @xmath18 is not within the black hole for _ every _ possible evolution of @xmath305 , then there is no finite upper bound on the lifetime of our observer as there will be a possible evolution for which there is a causal curve with past endpoint @xmath18 and future endpoint on @xmath311 ( with such a curve having infinite length ) .",
    "in other words , in this case we can choose our possible evolution so that the observer in fact was never within a black hole .",

    "this choice uniquely defines @xmath342 everywhere on @xmath347 ( up to the addition of an overall constant to @xmath342 ) and has the advantage that the completeness of @xmath339 is then equivalent to the property of @xmath342 assuming all values on @xmath204 .",
