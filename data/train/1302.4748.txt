    "the pairing symmetry of the superconducting state in iron - based superconductors ( ibs ) has been one of the most debated subjects since their first discovery , in both theory and experiments.@xcite its determination is particularly challenging in the ibs for their complex electronic structure , with a strong multiband character , and a fermi surface constituted by many sheets , which can vary with doping and chemical composition . moreover , the ibs families are usually compensated metals , and thus both electrons and holes are involved in the paired state .",
    "weak - coupling rpa approaches , coupled to multiband bcs theory , yield a pairing function with global s - wave ( @xmath0 ) symmetry , but with electron and holes pockets having opposite sign .",
    "this scenario , dubbed @xmath7 , was first proposed by mazin _ _ et al.__@xcite complemented later with its variants , called `` extended @xmath7'',@xcite in the case that accidental nodes appear on a single fermi sheet without breaking the full rotational symmetry .",
    "the latest generalizations include also `` weak '' nodal lines which develop as closed loops on the 3-dimensional ( 3d ) fermi surface.@xcite    a variety of experiments has been performed to probe the pairing symmetry of ibs , ranging from thermal conductivity and specific heat measurements to angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . while there is no doubt on the spin singlet nature of the pairing state as revealed by the knight shift,@xcite the presence of nodes and the total symmetry of the spatial part of the pairing function are controversial .",
    "in fact , the experimental outcome seems to lack universality , as it depends crucially on the `` family '' of tested compound , its doping , its isovalent substitutions , and its level of disorder .",
    "for instance , the situation is paradoxical for the `` 111 '' family , where the lifeas material shows a fully gapped superconducting order parameter , while the isovalent substitution of arsenic by phosphorus leads to thermodynamic properties compatible with a nodal pairing function.@xcite for the `` 122 '' family , there is a recent claim , supported by independent experimental probes , that the pairing in the bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 undergoes an @xmath4-to-@xmath5 symmetry change by doping with potassium,@xcite the fully substituted kfe@xmath6as@xmath6 being identified as a @xmath5-wave superconductor.@xcite in the `` 1111 '' family , the dependence of the critical temperature @xmath1 upon disorder has been studied in the lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 with @xmath8 .",
    "it has been found that co - doping induced disorder makes @xmath1 to fall much more slowly than mn - doping.@xcite this is certainly not compatible with a doping independent pairing function with sign changes ( either @xmath7 or @xmath5-wave ) .",
    "finally , specific heat measurements performed on the fese revealed a highly anisotropic order parameter in the `` 11 '' family,@xcite with a twofold symmetry directly observed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite    in this paper , we study the ibs gap structure from a different perspective , namely by looking for its _ universal _ features based on symmetry constraints induced by the 3d _ space - group _ transformations of the crystals . we prove that the ibs pairing function is a linear combination of terms having planar s- and d - wave symmetries , both fulfilling the full 3d @xmath0 representation .",
    "these properties are then verified in the fese by performing state - of - the - art quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations from first - principles .",
    "our theory provides a general framework to account for the contradictory experimental outcomes .",
    "the paper is organized as it follows . in sec .",
    "[ improper_symmetry ] we present the derivation of the 2d iron lattice model consistent with the symmetries of the 3d point group of the fese .",
    "we show that it is necessary to include improper rotations and a gauge transformation for translations in order to define a 2d square lattice model consistent with the 3d structure .",
    "we study what are the implications of the symmetry constraints for the pairing structure , and show that a d@xmath9-wave channel is present beside the extended s - wave one .",
    "these predictions are verified by accurate quantum monte carlo simulations , presented in sec .",

    "[ bcs_modeling ] we model the ab - initio pairing function by means of a bcs hamiltonian .",
    "this allows us to compute the bcs gap on a dense k - point grid , and study its nodal structure in the k - space . in sec .",
    "[ physical_consequences ] we relate our findings to the experimental outcome in fese , and to other experiments in different families of iron pnictides and chalcogenides .",
    "the undistorted structure of fese , together with the other parent compounds of the `` 111 '' and `` 1111 '' families , belongs to the @xmath11 space - group , which is nonsymmorphic due to a glide plane parallel to the iron layers .",
    "indeed , its related @xmath12 point - group classes contain certain operations with the nonprimitive lattice translation @xmath13 - expressed in crystal units of the 2-fe unit cell - which brings a fe site into the other in the cell .",
    "this is due to the se sites alternating above and below the fe layer ( see fig.[fordummies ] ) .",
    "fe@xmath6 ) are below ( lower triangles ) or above ( upper triangles ) the iron layer .",
    "it is evident that a symmetry operation like rotation of 90 degrees around an iron atom , interchanges lower triangles with upper ones .",
    "therefore a further reflection @xmath14 in the iron plane has to be combined with the 90 degree rotation to define a correct symmetry of the hamiltonian . in a low energy model",
    "where se and as atomic centers do not appear , their effect is to define a non trivial spatial symmetry in the iron square lattice where orbital and spatial degrees of freedom are strongly coupled in an unusual way .",
    "as noted in ref .  , also translation symmetry is not defined , but the composition of translation and reflection @xmath14 is again a well defined symmetry of the model .",
    "then , the fictitious broken translation symmetry of the low energy model can be easily gauged out ( see text and ref .  ) . ]    in particular , the @xmath15 subgroup generated by pure rotations by @xmath16 about the principal axis is not compatible with the structure of the solid . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10 subgroup , defined with the rotation by @xmath16 about the principal axis combined with the reflection @xmath14 through the fe plane ( @xmath17 ) , is a a pure point - group operation allowed by the @xmath11 space - group , as well as the reflection through the plane perpendicular to the fe ( xy ) plane and bisecting the secondary ( x and y ) axes ( the @xmath18 element).@xcite    this has important consequences on the symmetries of the subgroup associated with the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) fe square sublattice , and thus on the low - energy features of the system , as for instance , the superconducting gap structure .",
    "indeed , the standard @xmath19 group of the 2d square lattice , generated by the elementary @xmath18 and @xmath15 point - group operations , does not fulfill all symmetries of the @xmath11 space - group , whereas the group generated by @xmath18 and @xmath10 does .",
    "moreover , proper ( @xmath15 ) and improper ( @xmath10 ) rotations differ from the physical point of view , because a hamiltonian or a pairing function fulfilling the point - group operations generated by @xmath10 and @xmath18 will transform in a very different way with respect to those based on the standard @xmath19 group , as it will be shown in the following .    from ab - initio electronic structure dft and dmft calculations of ibs,@xcite",
    "it is well established that the bands crossing the fermi level have a strong d - orbital character .",
    "indeed , the minimal tight - binding hamiltonian which reproduces successfully the fermi surface contains all the five atomic ( or wannier ) d - orbitals centered on the fe sites,@xcite namely @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , expressed with the crystal axes oriented according to the fe square lattice directions .",
    "a given atomic orbital @xmath25 defining the 2d multiorbital model can be represented by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 lives in the 3d space , @xmath28 is the center of the atomic orbital on the square lattice , @xmath29 is the orbital symmetry , and @xmath30 is the electron spin . a spatial point - group operation @xmath31 acts on the orbital creation operator by changing its position @xmath32 , its phase @xmath33 and its orbital label @xmath34 according to the general rule : @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath29 given , the corresponding @xmath37 and @xmath38 are reported in tab .",

    "note the different @xmath37 between proper @xmath15 and improper @xmath10 rotations in the first two orbitals ( odd with respect to @xmath14 ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is readily seen in fig .",
    "( [ fordummies ] ) , also the elementary translation symmetry bringing one iron atom to a nearest neighbor one , is not defined on the plane , because , under this transformation , the upper triangles are interchanged with the lower ones .",
    "again the combination of the conventional translation @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) symmetry with the reflection @xmath14 is a well defined symmetry of the crystal @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , isomorphic to the conventional translation group of the square lattice . in a low energy model with a given number of orbitals",
    "@xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) behaves like the conventional translation group , only if we take into account a non - translation invariant sign in the definition of the localized basis , namely : @xmath47 for the orbitals @xmath48 that are odd with respect to the symmetry operator @xmath14 .",

    "[ gaugeout ] .    with these conventions ,",
    "let us take into account the 2d tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath51 which defines the low - energy model for the ibs .",

    "is easily removed , and the low energy model becomes translational invariant , with a corresponding unfolded bz .    in our approach",
    "we want to point out that a low energy two - dimensional model , like the free - band model in eq.([h_0 ] ) , has to be not only translation invariant but has to satisfy also all point symmetry transformations generated by @xmath18 and @xmath10 , the compatible subgroup of the full @xmath11 space - group .",
    "the latter point group is isomorphic to the standard @xmath19 group of the square lattice provided , in this group , we identify the @xmath16 rotation with the corresponding improper one .",
    "if we apply the transformation rules in eq .",

    "these transformations have already been derived in refs .   and or implicitly assumed in refs .   and .",
    "however , their implications for the pairing properties have so far been overlooked .    the pairing operator @xmath65 is assumed to be translationally invariant ( on the square lattice with one iron atom for unit cell and with the sign convention given in eq .  [ gaugeout ] for the odd reflection orbitals ) , so that it is convenient to write it in @xmath66-space as @xmath67 singlet pairing , and no broken time - reversal symmetry imply that @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , respectively . in the following ,",

    "this assumption will be verified later by ab - initio qmc calculations with a fully optimized jastrow projected bcs wave function .",

    "<S> by means of space - group symmetry arguments , we argue that the electronic pairing in iron - based high temperature superconductors shows a structure which is a linear combination of _ planar _ s - wave and d - wave symmetry channels , both preserving the 3-dimensional @xmath0 irreducible representation of the corresponding crystal point - group . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the s- and d - wave channels are determined by the parity under reflection of the electronic orbitals through the iron planes , and by improper rotations around the iron sites . we provide evidence of these general properties by performing accurate quantum monte carlo ab - initio calculations of the pairing function , for a fese lattice with tetragonal experimental geometry at ambient pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this picture survives even in the fese under pressure and at low temperatures , when the tetragonal point - group symmetry is slightly broken . in order to achieve a higher resolution in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a bcs model that faithfully describes our qmc variational pairing function on the simulated 4x4 fese unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to provide a k - resolved image of the pairing function , and show that non - isotropic contributions in the bcs gap function are related to the improper s - wave symmetry . our theory can rationalize and explain a series of contradictory experimental findings , such as the observation of twofold symmetry in the fese superconducting phase , the anomalous drop of @xmath1 with co - impurity in lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 , the @xmath4-to-@xmath5-wave gap transition in bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 under k doping , and the nodes appearing in the lifeas superconducting gap upon p isovalent substitution </S>"
