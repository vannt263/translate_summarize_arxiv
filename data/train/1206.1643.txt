    "dynamical systems theory plays an important role in many areas of mathematics and physics because it provides the building blocks that allow us to understand the changes many physical systems experience in their dynamics when parameters are varied .",
    "these building blocks are the generic bifurcations ( saddle - node , hopf , etc . ) that any arbitrary physical system experiences under parameter variation , regardless of the physical mechanisms underlying the dynamics .",
    "when one single parameter of the system under consideration is varied , codimension - one bifurcations are expected . if the system depends on more parameters , higher codimension bifurcations appear and they act as organizing centers of the dynamics .",
    "the presence of symmetries changes the nature and type of bifurcations that a dynamical system may undergo .",
    "symmetries play an important role in many idealized situations , where simplifying assumptions and the consideration of simple geometries result in dynamical systems equivariant under a certain symmetry group .",
    "bifurcations with symmetry have been widely studied @xcite . however , in any real system , the symmetries are only approximately fulfilled , and the breaking of the symmetries , due to the presence of noise , imperfections and/or other phenomena , is always present .",
    "there are numerous studies of how imperfect symmetries lead to dynamics that are unexpected in the symmetric problem , e.g.   @xcite",
    ". however , a complete theory is currently unavailable .",
    "one observed consequence of imperfections in systems that support propagating waves is that the waves may become trapped by the imperfections ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these various examples ,",
    "the propagation direction is typically biased .",
    "however , a more recent problem has considered a case where a rotating wave whose sense of precession changes sign is pinned by symmetry - breaking imperfections @xcite .",
    "we are unaware of any systematic analysis of the associated normal form dynamics for such a problem and this motivates the present study .",
    "when a system is invariant to rotations about an axis ( invariance under the @xmath0 symmetry group ) , @xmath0-symmetry - breaking hopf bifurcations result in rotating waves , consisting of a pattern that rotates about the symmetry axis at a given precession frequency without changing shape .",
    "this frequency is parameter dependent , and in many problems , when parameters are varied , the precession frequency changes sign along a curve in parameter space .",
    "what has been observed in different systems is that in the presence of imperfections , the curve of zero frequency becomes a band of finite width in parameter space . within this band ,",
    "the rotating wave becomes a steady solution .",
    "this is the so - called pinning phenomenon .",
    "it can be understood as the attachment of the rotating pattern to some stationary imperfection of the system , so that the pattern becomes steady , as long as its frequency is small enough so that the imperfection is able to stop the rotation .",
    "this pinning phenomenon bears some resemblance to the frequency locking phenomena , although in the frequency locking case we are dealing with a system with two non - zero frequencies and their ratio becomes constant in a region of parameter space ( a resonance horn ) , whereas here we are dealing with a single frequency crossing zero .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyze the breaking of @xmath0 symmetry in a dynamical system close to a hopf bifurcation whose frequency changes sign along a curve in parameter space .",
    "the analysis shows that breaking @xmath0 symmetry is much more complex than expected , resulting in a bifurcation of high codimension ( about nine ) .",
    "although it is not possible to analyze in detail such a complex and high - codimension bifurcation , we present here the analysis of five different ways to break @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this is done by introducing into the normal form all the possible terms , up to and including second order , that break the symmetry , and analyzing each of these five terms separately .",
    "three of these particular cases have already been analyzed in completely different contexts unrelated to the pinning phenomenon @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we extract the common features that are associated with the pinning . in all cases , we find that a band of pinning solutions appears around the zero frequency curve from the symmetric case , and that the band is delimited by curves of infinite - period bifurcations .",
    "the details of what happens when the infinite - period bifurcation curves approach the hopf bifurcation curve are different in the five cases , and involve complicated dynamics with several codimension - two bifurcations occurring in a small region of parameter space as well as several global bifurcations .",
    "interest in the present analysis is two - fold .",
    "first of all , although the details of the bifurcational process close to the zero - frequency hopf point are very complicated and differ from case to case , for all cases we observe the appearance of a pinning band delimited by infinite - period bifurcations of homoclinic type that , away from the small region of complicated dynamics , are snic bifurcations ( saddle - node on an invariant circle bifurcation , e.g.  see * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , some of the scenarios analyzed are important _ per se _ , as they correspond to the generic analysis of a partial breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry , so that after the introduction of perturbations , the system still retains a discrete symmetry ( the @xmath2 case is analyzed in detail ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_perfect_hopf ] the properties of a hopf bifurcation with @xmath0 symmetry with the precession frequency crossing through zero are summarized , and the general unfolding of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking process is discussed .",
    "the next sections explore the particulars of breaking the symmetry at order zero (  [ sec_epsilon ] ) , one (  [ sec_bar_z ] ) and two (  [ sec_quadratic ] ) . sections  [ sec_bar_z ] and  [ sec_z3 ] are particularly interesting because they consider the symmetry - breaking processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are readily realized experimentally .",
    "section  [ sec_general ] extracts the general features of the pinning problem from the analysis of the specific cases carried out in the earlier sections .",
    "section  [ sec_experiments ] presents comparisons with experiments and numerical computations in two real problems in fluid dynamics , illustrating the application of the general theory developed in the present study . finally , in  [ conclusions",
    "] , conclusions and perspectives are presented .",
    "the normal form for a hopf bifurcation is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the complex amplitude of the bifurcating periodic solution , @xmath7 is the bifurcation parameter , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of @xmath7 and generically at the bifurcation point ( @xmath10 ) both are different from zero .",
    "it is the non - zero character of @xmath8 that allows one to eliminate the quadratic terms in @xmath6 in the normal form .",
    "this is because the normal form @xmath11 satisfies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a low order polynomial that captures the dynamics in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point .",
    "if @xmath14 , this equation becomes an identity and @xmath13 can not be simplified .",
    "the case @xmath14 is a complicated bifurcation and it depends on the details of the double - zero eigenvalue of the linear part @xmath15 of @xmath13 ; as @xmath16 is complex , the matrix of @xmath15 using the real coordinates @xmath17 is a real @xmath18 matrix .",
    "if @xmath15 is not completely degenerate , that is @xmath19 then we have the well - studied takens ",
    "bogdanov bifurcation , whereas the completely degenerate case , @xmath20 is a high - codimension bifurcation that has not been completely analyzed .    if the system has @xmath0 symmetry , it must also satisfy @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the discrete symmetry retained by the bifurcated solution .",
    "when the group @xmath1 is generated by rotations of angle @xmath22 about an axis of @xmath23-fold symmetry , as is usually the case with @xmath0 , then the group is also called @xmath24 .",
    "equations and are completely equivalent and have the same implications for the normal form structure . advancing in time is the same as rotating the solution by a certain angle ( @xmath25 ) ; the bifurcated solution is a rotating wave .",
    "therefore , if @xmath8 becomes zero by varying a second parameter , we still have the same normal form , due to , with @xmath8 replaced by a small parameter @xmath26 : @xmath27 the hopf bifurcation with @xmath0 symmetry and zero frequency is , in this sense , trivial .",
    "introducing the modulus and phase of the complex amplitude @xmath28 , the normal form becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and let us assume for the moment that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are positive .",
    "the bifurcation frequency in is now the small parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the bifurcated solution @xmath33 exists only for @xmath34 , and has amplitude @xmath35 and frequency @xmath36 .",
    "the limit cycle @xmath33 becomes an invariant set of steady solutions along the straight line @xmath37 ( labeled l in figure  [ zerohopf ] ) where the frequency of @xmath33 goes to zero ; the angle between l and the hopf bifurcation curve ( the horizontal axis @xmath10 ) is @xmath38 .",
    "the bifurcation diagram and a schematic of the bifurcations along a one - dimensional path is also shown in figure  [ zerohopf ] .",
    "the bifurcation point @xmath39 , labeled zf ( zero - frequency hopf point ) in figure  [ zerohopf]@xmath40 , is a codimension - two bifurcation .",
    "it coincides with the generic hopf bifurcation , except that it includes a line l along which the bifurcated solution has zero frequency .",
    "symmetry and zero frequency ; part @xmath40 shows the bifurcation diagram , where the thick lines are bifurcation curves , and part @xmath41 shows the bifurcations along the path a shown in @xmath40 .",
    "the fixed point curve is labeled with the signs of its eigenvalues . in regions ii@xmath42 and ii@xmath43 the limit cycles , born at the hopf bifurcations h@xmath42 and h@xmath43 , rotate in opposite senses .",
    "l is the line where the limit cycle becomes an invariant curve of fixed points . ]    assuming @xmath44 , we can simplify by scaling @xmath6 so that @xmath45 ; we will write @xmath46 which helps simplify subsequent expressions . the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 both positive , which we will analyze in detail in the following sections , corresponds to one of the fluid dynamics problems that motivated the present analysis . for other signs of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , analogous conclusions can be drawn .",
    "it is of particular interest to consider the subcritical case @xmath47 as it corresponds to the other fluid dynamics problem analyzed here . by reversing time and changing the sign of @xmath7 and @xmath26 ,",
    "we obtain exactly the same normal form but with the opposite sign of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . by changing the sign of @xmath48 and @xmath26",
    ", we obtain with the opposite sign of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , all possible cases corresponding to different signs of @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be reduced to the case where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both positive .",
    "if the @xmath0 symmetry in the normal form is completely broken , and no symmetry remains , then the restrictions imposed on the normal form by disappear completely and all the terms in @xmath6 and @xmath49 missing from will reappear multiplied by small parameters .",
    "this means that the normal form will be @xmath50 where additional cubic terms have been neglected because we assume @xmath44 and that @xmath51 will be dominant .",
    "as the @xmath52 are complex , we have a problem with 12 parameters .",
    "additional simplifications can be made in order to obtain the so - called hypernormal form ; this method is extensively used by @xcite , for example .",
    "unfortunately , many of the simplifications rely on having some low - order term in the normal form being non - zero with a coefficient of order one .",
    "for example , if @xmath53 , it is possible to make @xmath9 real by using a time re - parametrization . in our problem , all terms up to and including second order are zero or have a small coefficient , and so only a few simplifications are possible .",
    "these simplifications are an infinitesimal translation of @xmath6 ( two parameters ) , and an arbitrary shift in the phase of @xmath6 ( one parameter ) . using these transformations the twelve parameters",
    "can be reduced to nine . in particular ,",
    "one of either @xmath54 or @xmath55 can be taken as zero and the other can be made real . by rescaling @xmath6 , we can make @xmath9 of modulus one , as in .",
    "a complete analysis of a normal form depending on nine parameters , i.e.  a bifurcation of codimension of about nine , is completely beyond the scope of the present paper . in the literature",
    ", only codimension - one bifurcations have been completely analyzed .",
    "most of the codimension - two bifurcations for ode and maps have also been analyzed , except for a few bifurcations for maps that remain outstanding @xcite .",
    "a few codimension - three and very few codimension - four bifurcations have also been analyzed @xcite , but to our knowledge , there is no systematic analysis of bifurcations of codimension greater than two .    in the following sections , we consider the five cases , @xmath56 to @xmath55 , separately .",
    "a combination of analytical and numerical tools allows for a detailed analysis of these bifurcations .",
    "we extract the common features of the different cases when @xmath57 , which captures the relevant behavior associated with weakly breaking @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "in particular , the @xmath58 case exhibits very interesting and rich dynamics that may be present in some practical cases when the @xmath0 symmetry group is not completely broken and a @xmath2 symmetry group , generated by the half - turn @xmath59 , remains .",
    "some general comments can be made here about these five cases , which are of the form @xmath60 for integers @xmath61 , excluding the case @xmath62 which is @xmath0 equivariant and so @xmath63 can be absorbed into @xmath7 and @xmath26 . by changing the origin of the phase of @xmath6 , we can modify the phase of @xmath63 so that it becomes real and positive .",
    "then , by re - scaling @xmath6 , time @xmath64 , and the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath26 as @xmath65 we obtain with @xmath66 , effectively leading to codimension - two bifurcations in each of the five cases",
    ". we expect complex behavior for @xmath67 , when the three parameters are of comparable size , while the effects of small imperfections breaking @xmath0 will correspond to @xmath68 .",
    "from now on @xmath66 will be assumed , and we can restore the explicit @xmath63-dependence by reversing the transformation .",
    "three of the five normal forms have been analyzed in the literature ( discussed below ) , focusing on the regions where @xmath7 , @xmath26 and @xmath63 are of comparable size ; here we will also consider what happens for @xmath68 which is particularly important for the pinning phenomenon .    the normal forms corresponding to the @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath69 cases have already been analyzed in contexts completely different to the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking context considered here .",
    "the context in which these problems were studied stems from low - order resonances in perturbed hopf problems .",
    "@xcite studied time - periodic forcing near a hopf bifurcation point , analyzing the problem using the poincar stroboscopic map .",
    "the normal forms corresponding to the 1:1 , 1:2 and 1:3 strong resonances coincide with the normal forms we present below for cases with only the @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath69 terms retained in , respectively .",
    "later , motivated by a problem of a nonlinear oscillator with damping and quasi - periodic driving , a series of papers extended the strong resonances results of @xcite by studying the semi - global bifurcations for periodically and quasi - periodically perturbed driven damped oscillators near a hopf bifurcation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the other two cases we consider , with only the @xmath54 or the @xmath55 terms retained in , do not appear to have been studied previously .",
    "they fall outside of the context in which the other three were studied because they do not correspond to any canonical resonance problem .",
    "we should point out that within the resonance context , the three cases studied would not make sense to consider in combination ( they correspond to completely distinct frequency ratios and so would not generically occur in a single problem ) .",
    "in contrast , within the context motivating our study , all five cases correspond to different ways in which the @xmath0 symmetry of a system may be broken , and in a physical realization , all five could co - exist . in the following sections , we present a detailed analysis of all five cases .",
    "the normal form to be analyzed is with @xmath70 and @xmath66 : @xmath71 this case has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce coordinates @xmath72 in parameter space , rotated an angle @xmath38 with respect to @xmath73 , so that the line l becomes the new coordinate axis @xmath74 .",
    "many features , that are symmetric with respect to l will then simplify ; e.g.  the distance to the bifurcation point along l is precisely @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ uv_and_epsilon_sn]@xmath40 shows the relationship between the two coordinate systems .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      another feature we have found in the five scenarios discussed above is that the snic@xmath79 bifurcations , where the stable limit cycle disappears on entering the pinning region away from the origin ( @xmath39 ) , become homoclinic ( or heteroclinic if the @xmath0 symmetry is not completely broken ) collisions between the stable limit cycle and the saddle point that is born in the saddle - node bifurcations sn@xmath79 that now take place not on the limit cycle but very close to it .",
    "there is a codimension - two global bifurcation , termed snichom in the bifurcation diagrams discussed above , where the snic curve , the saddle - node curve and the homoclinic collision curve meet .",
    "the scaling laws of the periods when approaching a homoclinic or a snic bifurcation are different , having logarithmic or square root profiles : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the positive eigenvalue of the saddle , and @xmath82 a constant .",
    "so the question is what happens with the scaling of the period close to the snichom bifurcation ?",
    "we have analized in detail the @xmath83 case , being the other cases very similar .",
    "we refer to the figures  [ imphopf_regions ] and [ snic_het ] from a practical point of view , close to but before the snichet@xmath42 point , the saddle - node bifurcation sn@xmath42 is very closely followed by the heteroclinic collision of the limit cycle @xmath84 with the saddles @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and it becomes almost indistinguishable from the snic@xmath42 bifurcation .",
    "we have numerically computed the period of @xmath84 at @xmath87 for decreasing @xmath7 values approaching sn@xmath42 in the range @xmath88 $ ] , for @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ snic_versus_hom]@xmath40 shows both fits using the values of the period over the whole computed range .",
    "the log fit overestimates the period while the square - root fit underestimates it , and this underestimate gets larger as the heteroclinic collision is approached .",
    "figure  [ snic_versus_hom]@xmath41 again shows both fits , but now using values close to the collision for the log fit and values far away from the collision for the square - root fit .",
    "both fits are now very good approximations of the period in their corresponding intervals , and together cover all the values numerically computed .",
    "when the interval between the sn@xmath42 bifurcation and the heteroclinic collision ( in figure  [ snic_versus_hom ] , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively ) is very small , it can not be resolved experimentally ( or even numerically in an extended systems with millions of degrees of freedom , as is the case in fluid dynamics governed by the three - dimensional navier ",
    "stokes equations ) .",
    "in such a situation the square - root fit looks good enough , because away from the sn@xmath42 point , the dynamical system just feels the ghost of the about to be formed saddle - node pair and does not distinguish between whether the saddle - node appears on the limit cycle or very close to it .",
    "however , if we are able to resolve the very narrow parameter range between the saddle - node formation and the subsequent collision with the saddle , then the log fit matches the period in this narrow interval much better .    due to the presence of two very close bifurcations ( het and sn@xmath42 ) ,",
    "the scaling laws become cross - contaminated , and from a practical point of view the only way to distinguish between a snic and a homoclinic collision is by computing or measuring periods extremelly close to the infinite - period bifurcation point .",
    "we can also see this from the log fit equation in ; when both bifurcations are very close , @xmath81 , the positive eigenvalue of the saddle , goes to zero ( it is exactly zero at the saddle - node point ) , so the log fit becomes useless , except when the periods are very large .",
    "when the interval between the sn@xmath42 bifurcation and the homoclinic collision is very small , it can not be resolved experimentally ( or even numerically in an extended systems with millions of degrees of freedom , as is the case in fluid dynamics governed by the three - dimensional navier ",
    "stokes equations ) .",
    "in such a situation , the square - root fit appears to be good enough , because away from the sn@xmath42 point , the dynamical system just feels the ghost of the about - to - be - formed saddle - node pair and does not distinguish between whether the saddle - node appears on the limit cycle or just very close to it .",
    "however , if we are able to resolve the very narrow parameter range between the saddle - node formation and the subsequent collision with the saddle , then the log fit matches the period in this narrow interval much better .",
    "the bifurcations that a limit cycle can undergo have been an active subject of research since dynamical systems theory was born . even in the case of isolated codimension - one bifurcations ,",
    "a complete classification was not completed until fifteen years ago @xcite , when the blue - sky catastrophe was found .",
    "the seven possible bifurcations are : the hopf bifurcation , where a limit cycle shrinks to a fixed point , and the length of the limit cycle reduces to zero .",
    "three bifurcations where both the length and period of the limit cycle remain finite : the saddle node of cycles ( or cyclic fold ) , the period doubling and the neimark - sacker bifurcations .",
    "two bifurcations where the length remains finite but the period goes to infinity : the collision of the limit cycle with an external saddle forming a homoclinic loop , and the appearance of a saddle - node of fixed points on the limit cycle ( the snic bifurcation ) .",
    "finally , there is the blue - sky bifurcation where both the length and period go to infinity , corresponding to the appearance of a saddle - node of limit cycles transverse to the given limit cycle .",
    "the seven bifurcations are described in many books on dynamical systems , e.g.  @xcite ; they are also described on the web page http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/blue-sky_catastrophe maintained by a.  shilnikov and d.  turaev .    of the seven bifurcations , only four ( hopf , cyclic fold , homoclinic collision and snic ) are possible in planar systems , as is the case in the present study , and we have found the four of them in the different scenarios explored . we have also found a number of codimension - two bifurcations of limit cycles . for these bifurcations",
    "a complete classification is still lacking , and it is interesting to list them because some of the bifurcations obtained are not very common .",
    "the codimension - two bifurcations of limit cycles associated to codimension - two bifurcations of fixed points can be found in many dynamical systems texbooks , and include takens  bogdanov bifurcations ( present in almost all cases considered here ) and the bautin bifurcation ( in the @xmath63 case ) .",
