    "<S> we consider a fluid in the boussinesq approximation  @xcite with the scaling @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are non - dimensional constants of order one and where @xmath56 is the small parameter for the multiple scale analysis . in our experiments , </S>",

    "<S> , this analysis will allow to get physical insight to the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the essential point is that nonlinear terms are negligible at lowest order , and that variations of the wave - amplitude in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 direction are of the same order of magnitude .    </S>",

    "<S> the wave generator occupies only one part of the tank width , so one might expect horizontal variations of the wave amplitude , which fulfills the necessary condition to observe generation of a horizontal mean flow associated with non - zero vertical vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> a second consequence is that if the wave field is symmetric in the @xmath5-direction then the source term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_vort2 ] ) , resulting from a derivation of the wave field with respect to  @xmath5 , is antisymmetric in the @xmath5-direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in our experiments , because the wave generator is symmetric with respect to  @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a third consequence is that variations in the @xmath6 directions are necessary to produce vertical vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> such variation is due to viscous attenuation  @xcite and occurs at a scale @xmath63 introduced previously .    </S>",
    "<S> reference  @xcite reported that a single wave beam could not generate a mean flow in a two - dimensional ( or axi - symmetric ) configuration , with invariance in the y - direction . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite also showed that a mean flow can be generated by two interacting wave beams , even if there is no variation of the wave amplitude in the @xmath5 direction . </S>",

    "<S> finally , let us describe the spatial structure of the nonlinear term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_vort2 ] ) in our experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> the wave generator induces a symmetric wave field in the @xmath5-direction , maximum at the origin , satisfying @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_vort2 ] ) , we conclude that the source term induces a dipolar vorticity structure associated with a horizontal jet going in the outward direction from the wave generator .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now estimate quantitatively this source term . in the experimental results presented here , the wave generator is not tilted with respect to the vertical and not infinite in the direction of phase propagation , but we expect that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_vort2 ] ) remains valid if we consider the flow at mid - depth of the wave generator sufficiently far from the lateral boundary . </S>",

    "<S> however our simple model predicts @xmath96 . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , considering that the horizontal mean flow is non - divergent , the advection term can be written @xmath98 , and the surface integral of this term vanishes since @xmath62 is zero on the @xmath99 axis and the filtered horizontal velocity field is zero on the other edges of the domain . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we expect that eq . </S>",

    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + +    we have reported experimental observations of a strong horizontal mean flow with non - zero vertical vorticity when a propagative monochromatic wave is forced on the side of a tank filled with a linearly stratified fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we stress here that there is no such mean flow in absence of internal waves propagation , for example when the wave generator is excited at a frequency @xmath29 larger than the brunt - visl frequency  @xmath101 , as in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredient for the existence of this mean vertical vorticity with a dipolar structure , associated with a strong horizontal jet flowing outward of the wave generator is the concomitant existence of variations of the wave amplitude in both horizontal directions . in the transverse direction ( @xmath5 ) , the variations are simply due to the fact that the wave generator is localized in a segment smaller than the tank width . in the longitudinal direction , </S>",
    "<S> the variations of the wave amplitude are due to viscous attenuation . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the important role played by viscosity in the generation of the mean flow in our experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a similar phenomenon as the one described in this paper has been observed in the case of the reflexion of an internal wavebeam over topography  @xcite . although viscosity is essential for the wave beam attenuation in the experiments , several other physical mechanism may enhance its effect . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , parametric subharmonic instabilities followed by a direct energy cascade  @xcite or wave breaking  @xcite may lead to a spatially varying wave beam amplitude . rather than considering viscous effects , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite models the effect of wave breaking by a linear damping term in the buoyancy equation and uses generalized lagrangian - mean theory to describe the formation of a strong mean flow . </S>",
