    "since it s inception in 1961 , regge calculus @xcite has been extensively studied in highly symmetric spacetimes , for which corresponding exact solutions of einstein s equations are often available .",
    "a complete review and bibliography of this early work is provided by williams and tuckey @xcite .    following the realization that a fully decoupled , parallelizable , three - plus - one dimensional evolution scheme occurs naturally within regge calculus @xcite",
    ", this simplicial approach to gravity is now on the verge of tackling physically interesting and dynamic problems .",
    "the first tentative step along this path was recently completed , with the successful application of simplicial regge calculus to the kasner spacetime in @xmath0-dimensions @xcite .",
    "a vital precursor to the evolution problem in any general relativistic simulation is the construction of consistent initial data .",
    "gentle and miller @xcite present a general prescription for the calculation of two - surface initial data for the regge lattice , although their approach has only been applied to the kasner cosmology . as a prelude to the construction of simplicial initial data for complex spacetimes , in this paper we consider the restricted case of vacuum , axisymmetric initial data at a moment of time symmetry .",
    "this is the first step towards our goal , and provides a benchmark against which future , fully four - dimensional , initial data may be compared .",
    "we construct vacuum initial data for the pure brill wave spacetime @xcite , and for brill waves in a black hole spacetime  the `` distorted black holes '' first considered by bernstein @xcite .",
    "standard finite - difference techniques have been used to study pure brill wave spacetimes by eppley @xcite , miyama @xcite , holz @xcite and alcubierre @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetric brill wave plus black hole spacetime has been extensively investigated by bernstein @xcite , and more recently , a generalization to @xmath0-dimensions has been considered by camarda @xcite .",
    "dubal @xcite constructed pure brill wave initial data using regge calculus , with a lattice based on prisms rather than simplices .",
    "a similar approach was taken in an earlier version of the current work @xcite .",
    "we will consider the advantages and disadvantages of using a prism - based lattice , and argue that the prism - based construction can not , in general , satisfactorily reproduce the continuum solution , even in axisymmetry .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : continuum ] with a short survey of the important results from the continuum theory . in section [ sec : regge_ivp ] we discuss the initial value problem at a moment of time symmetry in regge calculus , and then proceed in section [ sec : prism ] to examine an axisymmetric lattice built from prisms . in section [ sec : simplicial ]",
    "we turn to a fully simplicial lattice , and finally , in section [ sec : convergence ] , we analyze the convergence of the simplicial initial data to the continuum solution .",
    "the vacuum constraint equations of general relativity may be written in the form ( see , for example , misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the intrinsic curvature tensor on the spacelike hypersurface , and @xmath3 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the extrinsic curvature @xmath4 determines the embedding of this slice in the spacetime . at a moment of time",
    "symmetry @xmath5 , and the constraints reduce to vanishing of the scalar three - curvature : @xmath6    the standard approach to the solution of this equation involves a conformal decomposition of the three - metric , such that @xmath7 which recasts equation ( [ eqn : continuum_ivp ] ) in the form @xmath8 which is linear in the conformal factor @xmath9 . the base metric @xmath10 is used to calculate the base scalar curvature @xmath11 .",
    "the base three - geometry may be freely specified , although the choice may restrict the class of possible solutions .",
    "solving this single linear elliptic partial differential equation yields the full initial data set at a moment of time symmetry .      in this section",
    "we introduce the axisymmetric vacuum initial value problem posed by brill @xcite .",
    "conformal decomposition using a flat base metric leads only to trivial solutions .",
    "the approach taken by brill @xcite was to introduce a metric of the form @xmath12 where the arbitrary function @xmath13 can be considered the distribution of gravitational wave amplitude @xcite .",
    "brill showed that @xmath13 must satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath14 together with the condition that @xmath15 as @xmath16 , to ensure that the hypersurface has an asymptotically well defined mass . with",
    "this choice of background metric , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqn : hamiltonian_symmetry ] ) takes the form @xmath17 which is solved for @xmath18 once @xmath13 is given .    to allow comparison with eppley @xcite",
    ", we choose @xmath13 to be of the form @xmath19 and the boundary conditions on @xmath20 imply that @xmath21 . in the remainder of this paper we set @xmath22 .",
    "the single remaining parameter , the wave amplitude @xmath23 , is arbitrary .    to obtain an axisymmetric , asymptotically flat solution",
    "which is reflection symmetric on the @xmath24 axis , we use boundary conditions on @xmath9 of the form @xmath25 together with a robin outer boundary condition , @xmath26    figure [ fig : continuum_brill]_a _ shows the solution of equation ( [ eqn : brill_hamiltonian ] ) obtained using a centred finite difference approximation to both the equation and boundary conditions .",
    "the solution was calculated on a @xmath27 grid with a brill wave amplitude @xmath28 .",
    "we now turn to the brill wave plus black hole spacetime , investigated in great detail by bernstein @xcite . as before ,",
    "a perturbation is introduced onto the background metric , and the conformal factor is calculated from the single initial value equation ( [ eqn : hamiltonian_symmetry ] ) .",
    "note that we solve the full initial value problem for the wave and black hole together .",
    "this is not a perturbation solution .    mirroring the pure brill wave spacetime of section [ sec : pure_brill ]",
    ", we write the physical metric on the initial surface in the form @xmath29 where the exponential radius co - ordinate @xmath30 is defined from @xmath31 .",
    "the `` mass '' @xmath32 is that of the black hole alone , obtained by setting @xmath33 . in @xmath34 co - ordinates ,",
    "the isolated black hole solution takes the form @xmath35    the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqn : hamiltonian_symmetry ] ) evaluated on the black hole plus brill wave metric , equation ( [ eqn : black_hole_brill ] ) , yields the linear constraint @xmath36 which is again solved for the conformal factor @xmath9 once the perturbation @xmath37 is given .",
    "we choose boundary conditions of the form @xmath38 on the `` inner '' boundaries , where @xmath39 corresponds to an einstein - rosen bridge at @xmath40 .",
    "these represent reflection symmetry on the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath39 boundaries .",
    "the outer boundary condition is again applied using the robin approach , adapted to the exponential radial co - ordinate @xmath30 . examining the asymptotic form of the black hole solution yields the condition @xmath43 on the outer boundary .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the metric for black hole plus brill wave initial data , equation ( [ eqn : black_hole_brill ] ) , is used to assign the base edge lengths . integrating the geodesics between the vertices on each edge , and retaining only leading order terms , yields a simplicial conformal decomposition of the form @xmath44 _ { i+\\frac{1}{2},k } \\ ,    \\delta \\eta _ i    \\nonumber \\\\    h_{ik } & = & \\left [ \\psi ^2 \\ , e^q \\right ] _ { i , k+\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ ,    \\delta \\theta _ k     \\\\",

    "the inner boundary conditions are obtained as before , by combining the continuum inner boundary condition ( [ eqn : hole_boundary1 ] ) with a power series expansion into the domain .",
    "the outer boundary uses a second order finite difference approximation to the robin condition , equation ( [ eqn : hole_boundary2 ] ) .",
    "the inner @xmath39 boundary condition is @xmath45 and similarly , the reflection conditions on at @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath46 these expansions are combined to give boundary conditions at the two `` corner points '' along @xmath39 , @xmath47    these boundary conditions , together with the assignment of edge lengths given by equations ( [ eqn : conformal_spherical ] ) , allow us to calculate and solve the initial value equation ( [ eqn : simplicial_ivp ] ) as before , except that we now take the pure black hole solution ( [ eqn : conformal_black_hole ] ) as the initial guess . in the following calculations we use bernstein s @xcite choice of @xmath37 , equation ( [ eqn : hole_q ] ) , together with a choice of the free parameters @xmath48 and the black hole mass @xmath32 .",
    "the solution is shown in figure [ fig : simplicial_plots ] _ _ , with the same set of parameter choices as figure .",
    "we again find excellent qualitative agreement between the continuum solution and the simplicial regge initial data . in the next section",
    "we will attempt to make the comparison more rigorous .",
    "we have seen in the preceding sections that the simplicial regge solutions show reasonable agreement with solutions of the continuum equations .",
    "we now make this comparison more quantitative .",
    "we have at hand two different numerical solutions for a given physical system and choice of the various parameters ; ( i ) the finite - difference solution to the continuum equation ( [ eqn : brill_bh_hamiltonian ] ) , and ( ii ) the solution of the regge initial value equation ( [ eqn : simplicial_ivp ] ) .",
    "since an exact solution is not available for comparison , the convergence analysis must be based solely on these equations and corresponding solutions .",
    "consider the finite - difference solution @xmath49 to the continuum equation .",
    "it represents an approximation to the exact solution @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is a typical grid scale , and @xmath54 .",
    "we expect that @xmath55 , since a second order accurate approximation to equation ( [ eqn : black_hole_brill ] ) was used to generate @xmath49 .",
    "in section [ sec : distorted_bh ] a convergence test for the pure black hole solution confirmed that the continuum code is second order accurate .",
    "now consider the simplicial regge solution @xmath56 , which we also expect to differ from the continuum solution by some amount dependent on the scale length @xmath53 . by this reasoning",
    "we see that the regge solution should also differ from the numerical solution of the continuum equations by some small amount .",
    "if we assume that @xmath57 where @xmath58 , we can write @xmath59 where we have neglected only terms smaller than @xmath60 . noting that the co - efficient of @xmath60 scales as order unity , we define the `` error '' between the numerical continuum and regge solutions as @xmath61 where @xmath62",
    ". the error @xmath63 may be calculated directly from the two numerical solutions , and doing so for a variety of grid scales @xmath53 yields an estimate of the convergence rate @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig : convergence ] _ _ shows the behaviour of the error @xmath63 as the number of grid points is increased ( hence @xmath53 decreased ) for both the pure brill wave and the distorted black hole initial data sets .",
    "the figure suggests a value of @xmath64 .",
    "that is , the difference between the simplicial regge solution and the numerical solution @xmath49 decreases as approximately the second power of the discretization scale .",
    "since the numerical solution @xmath49 itself differs the exact solution @xmath50 by terms of order @xmath65 , we conclude that the regge solution is a second order accurate approximation to @xmath50 , the underlying exact solution of the continuum equations .",
    "we have successfully used regge calculus to construct axisymmetric initial data at a moment of time symmetry .",
    "brill wave and distorted black hole initial data sets were obtained , and shown to agree well with the corresponding continuum solutions .",
    "the simplicial lattice  consisting of tetrahedra in three - dimensions  was found to yield solutions in excellent agreement with the continuum , and displayed none of the problems encountered with a prism - based regge lattice .",
    "in particular , we observed that the simplicial regge solution converged to the numerical solution of einstein s equations as the second power of the lattice spacing . from this",
    "it was inferred that the simplicial regge initial data is a second order accurate approximation to the exact solution .    even for axisymmetric gravitational waves at a moment of time symmetry ,",
    "we have found it necessary to abandon the prism - based lattice in favour of a simplicial approach .",
    "this indicates that the future development of regge calculus as a competitive and robust alternative to standard numerical techniques will require the use of fully simplicial lattices .",
    "work is currently underway to evolve this data set , in @xmath66-dimensions using an axisymmetric adaptation of the sorkin evolution scheme @xcite , as well as a fully @xmath0-dimensional evolution .",
    "the author wishes to thank leo brewin , warner miller and daniel holz for many stimulating discussions on this and related work .",
