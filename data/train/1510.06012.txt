    "the gauge / gravity duality contains interesting gravity theories . one of them is the known as lifshitz gravity that can be dual to scale - invariant field theories , being not conformally invariant . in this context , interesting properties are found when one generalizes the gauge / gravity duality to non - relativistic situations @xcite , being the lifshitz holographic superconductor one of the most well studied systems . such theories exhibit the anisotropic scale invariance @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the relative scale dimension of time and space .",
    "systems with such behavior appear , for instance , in the description of strongly correlated electrons .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a matter distribution outside the event horizon of the topological nonlinear charged lifshitz black hole in @xmath4-dimensions with a spherical and plane transverse section and dynamical exponent @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the matter is parameterized by scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "then , we obtain numerically the quasinormal frequencies ( qnfs ) for scalar fields , by using the improved aim @xcite , which is an improved version of the method proposed in references @xcite and it has been applied successful in the context of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) for different black hole geometries ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "then , we study their stability under scalar perturbations .",
    "we focus our study on dependence of the dynamical exponent , the nonlinear exponent , the momentum angular and the mass of the scalar field in obtaining of quasinormal frequencies overdamped .",
    "mainly , motivated by a recent work , where the authors have shown that for @xmath5 , at zero momenta , the modes are non - overdamped , whereas for @xmath6 the system is always overdamped @xcite .",
    "contrary to other lifshitz black holes , where the qnfs show the absence of a real part @xcite    in the gravity side of the gauge / gravity duality the qnfs @xcite gives information about the stability of black holes under matter fields that evolve perturbatively in their exterior region , these fields are considered as mere test fields , without backreaction over the spacetime itself . also , qnms have shown to be related to the area and entropy spectrum of black holes horizon .",
    "besides , the qnfs determine how fast a thermal state in the boundary theory will reach thermal equilibrium according to the gauge / gravity duality @xcite , where the relaxation time of a thermal state is proportional to the inverse of the smallest imaginary part of the qnfs of the dual gravity background , which was established due to the qnfs of the black hole being related to the poles of the retarded correlation function of the corresponding perturbations of the dual conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ background ] we give a brief review of the topological nonlinear charged lifshitz black holes that we will consider as background . in sec .",
    "[ qnm ] we calculate the qnfs of scalar perturbations numerically by using the improved aim",
    ". finally , our conclusions are in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the topological nonlinear charged lifshitz black holes that we consider is solution of the einstein - dilaton gravity in the presence of a power - law and two linear maxwell electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the action is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar on manifold m , @xmath9 is the dilaton field , @xmath10 is the cosmological constant , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the maxwell invariants of electromagnetic fields @xmath15}$ ] and @xmath16}$ ] , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electromagnetic potentials .",
    "the following metric is solution of the equations of motion of the theory defined by the action ( [ action4d ] ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric of the spatial 2-section , which can have positive @xmath21 , negative @xmath22 or zero curvature @xmath23 , and @xmath24 if the constant @xmath10 is @xmath25 the gauge field is given by @xmath26 and the gauge potential by @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 being @xmath30 and @xmath31 constants .",
    "also , in order to have a finite mass , @xmath32 should be positive , which imposes the following restrictions on @xmath33 and @xmath3 :    * for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , * for @xmath36 , all @xmath37 values are allowed , * for @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a scalar field minimally coupled to curvature is @xmath40where @xmath41 is the mass of the scalar field @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the qnms of scalar perturbations in the background of a four - dimensional topological nonlinear charged lifshitz black holes are given by the scalar field solution of the klein - gordon equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "now , by means of the following ansatz @xmath43where @xmath44 is a normalizable harmonic function on the two - sphere which satisfies the eigenvalues equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "then , the klein - gordon equation yields @xmath48+\\left[\\left(\\frac{l}{r}\\right)^{2(z+1)}\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{f(r)}-\\left(\\frac{l}{r}\\right)^{2}\\frac{q}{r^{2}}-\\left(\\frac{l}{r}\\right)^{2}m_s^{2}\\right ] r(r)=0~. \\label{radial}\\]]also , defining @xmath49 as @xmath50 and by using the tortoise coordinate @xmath51 given by @xmath52 the klein - gordon equation can be written as a one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath53 k(r_{\\ast})=0~,\\ ] ] where the effective potential @xmath54 @xmath55 diverges at spatial infinity , see fig .",
    "[ potential1 ] .",
    "therefore , we will consider that the field vanishes at the asymptotic region as boundary condition or dirichlet boundary condition . in fig .",
    "[ potential2 ] we plot the behavior of the effective potential near the horizon for different values of @xmath56 .",
    "it is worth to mention that is not trivial to find analytical solutions to eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) .",
    "so , we will perform numerical studies by using the improved aim @xcite . in order to implement the improved aim",
    "we make the following change of variables @xmath66 to eq .",
    "( [ kgnm ] ) .",
    "then , the klein - gordon equation yields @xmath67 now , in order to propose an ansatz for the scalar field , we must consider their behavior on the event horizon and at spatial infinity .",
    "accordingly , on the horizon , @xmath68 , their behavior is given by @xmath69 so , if we consider only ingoing waves on the horizon , we must impose @xmath70 . also , asymptotically , from eq .",
    "( [ numericalmethod ] ) , the scalar field behaves as @xmath71 so , in order to have a null field at infinity we must impose @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , taking into account these behaviors we define @xmath73 as ansatz . then , by inserting these fields in eq .",
    "( [ numericalmethod ] ) we obtain the homogeneous linear second - order differential equation for the function @xmath74 @xmath75where @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 that can be solved numerically ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "so , we choose the following parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath79 and @xmath61 .",
    "then , in table [ qnm1 ] , we show the fundamental quasionormal frequency and the first overtone for a massive scalar field @xmath60 and for a massless scalar field @xmath80 with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and different values of the momentum angular @xmath56 . we can observed that the modes are non - overdamped , at zero momenta",
    "otherwise , the system is always overdamped",
    ". then , in table [ qnm2 ] , we set @xmath81 and we show some lowest qnfs , for @xmath63 , and different values of @xmath3 for a massive scalar field @xmath60 and for a massless scalar field @xmath80 .",
    "we observe that there is a limit on the dynamical exponent @xmath3 ( @xmath82 ) above which the system is always overdamped .",
    "additionally , in table [ qnm3 ] we show some fundamentals qnfs , for @xmath62 , @xmath81 and different values of the nonlinear exponent @xmath33 for a massive scalar field @xmath60 , and for a massless scalar field @xmath80 , where we can observe that the behavior of the modes ( overdamped or non - overdamped ) do not depend on @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in all the cases analyzed , we observe that the modes have a negative imaginary part , which ensures the stability of four dimensional topological nonlinear charged lifshitz black holes with spherical transverse section under scalar perturbations .",
