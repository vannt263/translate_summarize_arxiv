    "in the study of the cosmic microwave background radiation , one of the basic information sources on the early universe , one deals with a principal problem of separation of the cosmological signal from perturbations of various nature @xcite.the cmb reflects not only effects occurring at the early or large scale universe , the sachs - wolf and sunyaev - zeldovich effects , but also more local perturbations of the galactic , interplanetary , and up to instrumental origin .",
    "various descriptors are applied to separate the cmb cosmological signal from a secondary signal of particular nature . in the present paper",
    "we will apply the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter @xcite to reveal the difference in the statistical properties of contributions irrelevant to the main cmb signal .",
    "as was already shown , the kolmogorov s parameter is an informative descriptor when applied to the cmb temperature sequences , namely , it enables one to locate regions of different randomness in the sky maps @xcite .",
    "for example , the cold spot , the non - gaussian anomaly in the southern sky , not only shows enhanced value of kolmogorov s parameter but also possess its variation along the radius peculiar to the voids in the large scale matter distribution in the universe @xcite ; the void nature of the cold spot is among the discussed interpretations @xcite .",
    "maps calculated for wmap w , v , q - band temperature data ( a - c ) , respectively , and for the simulated , no - noise ( d ) cmb maps . ]",
    "[ fig : cmbfi ]    we compute the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter and then kolmogorov s distribution for real cmb maps , namely , for the 3 bands of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe s ( wmap s ) temperature data in which the nature and the level of the galactic radiations is different .",
    "we also estimate the simulated maps which all together indicate that kolmogorov s parameter indeed is different for maps with different contamination .",
    "this motivates the interest to model the behavior of kolmogorov s parameter for the cmb ( continuing @xcite ) , via specially constructed sequences composed of subsystems of different statistic , i.e. with expected statistical properties similar to the perturbations present in the primary signal in cmb maps .",
    "such numerical laboratory results show that in certain cases one can clearly distinguish the signals due to the qualitative differences in the behavior of kolmogorov s parameter , in other cases , the quantitative properties are the indicative ones .",
    "first let us recall the definition of the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter @xcite . consider a finite random sequence of real numbers @xmath0 , so that @xmath1 are sorted in an increasing manner @xmath2 .",
    "the empirical distribution function is defined as    @xmath3 so that @xmath4    the theoretical distribution function @xmath5 is defined as    @xmath6    kolmogorov s stochasticity parameter @xmath7 for a sequence of @xmath8 values of @xmath9 is    @xmath10    so that @xmath7 itself is a random variable .",
    "according to the kolmogorov s theorem @xmath7 is a random number having empirical distribution function @xmath11 uniformly converging to a function @xmath12 at @xmath13 for any continuous distribution @xmath5 @xmath14    where    @xmath15    @xmath12 is kolmogorov s distribution , it varies from @xmath16 to @xmath17 monotonically .",
    "table 1 shows the kolmogorov s distribution @xmath12 and its derivative @xmath18 at the values of interest of @xmath19 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     then we split the sequences into 50 subsequences , obtain 50 values of @xmath20 for each subsequence , and calculate @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in the difference between the values of @xmath21 and theoretical mean @xmath22 where @xmath23 . for random sequences",
    "@xmath21 must be equal to theoretical mean value @xmath24 .",
    "therefore this difference is a direct measure that describes the degree of the randomness of a sequence , bigger is that difference , more regular is the sequence , for details see @xcite .     for all sequence groups , @xmath25",
    "denoting the number of the sequence.,width=4 ]    in figures [ fig : lambdamean ] and [ fig : chi2 ] horizontal axis @xmath25 is the index of the sequence , so each 1000 points corresponds to one group noted above .",
    "figure [ fig : lambdamean ] shows that , the difference between groups i and iii or iv are not obvious , i.e. the split subsequences do not `` feel '' the duplicates .",
    "also , for v and vi groups the perturbations are small , so again there is no visible difference between them and the group i. the random case differs from ii and vii groups , because of the different scales .",
    ".,width=4 ]    then we found out the behavior of @xmath26 for each group of sequences .",
    "@xmath26 is calculated for @xmath5 and @xmath27 and shows how far is the distribution from the uniform one . here",
    "@xmath26 is defined as    @xmath28    to generalize the considered above results , we studied sequences of the type    @xmath29    where @xmath30 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 specifies the limiting the random @xmath1 , and regular of the form @xmath33 , cases , respectively .",
    "101 sequences were studied , each containing 100 subsequences of length 10000 .",
    "steps of 0.01 were used for @xmath30 , so , to each @xmath30 correspond 100 sequences and hence we have 10100 sequences .",
    "plots of @xmath12 vs @xmath19 are shown for different values of @xmath30 in figure [ fig : a ] .    from the figure [ ris : image1](a )",
    "we can see that when @xmath34 ( the regular case ) , the normalized @xmath21 precisely corresponds to the normalized value for the second group of figure [ fig : lambdamean ] . for @xmath35 ( the random case )",
    ", the normalized @xmath21 precisely corresponds to the normalized @xmath21 for the second group shown in figure [ fig : lambdamean ] .    in figure",
    "[ ris : image1 ] @xmath26 and normalized @xmath21 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 cases behave the same way as in 2nd and 1st groups respectively in figures [ fig : chi2 ] and [ fig : lambdamean ] .",
    "we were also interested in the behavior of @xmath21 depending on the parameters of sequences i.e. the number of sequences , their length , number of the splits , type of @xmath36 , as well as on the steps of @xmath30 .",
    "we also changed the type of @xmath36 , their length and the number of splits , then fitted the corresponding numerical results with an exponential decaying function .",
    "figure [ fig : exp ] shows the results of computations .",
    "the left plots are the normalized @xmath21 dependences on the index of the sequence , the right plots are the corresponding fits . in each plot",
    "the legend above indicates the type of the generated sequences , the length and number of splits : for example , the figure [ fig : exp](a ) is a result of the generated sequences of the type @xmath37 , 10000 is the number of elements in each sequence and 50 is the number of splits of the sequences .",
    "one can see that the maximum of @xmath38 depends on the parameters of @xmath36 , the length of sequences and the number of splits , however , in the cases where the length and the number of splits ratios are equal , maximal values of @xmath39 are also equal to a precision about @xmath40 .",
    "when larger length sequences were applied , the error bars of the belt in figure [ fig : exp ] decrease and due to the large numbers of points the value of @xmath26 increases , as shown in the legends .",
    "we analyzed several types of sequences using the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter to model the contributions of signals of different statistic in the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the previously undertaken estimations of the kolmogorov s parameter for the real cmb temperature maps obtained by wmap had revealed the potential of the method in the separation of the galactic disk and of other structures in the previous works @xcite . we have also computed the kolmogorov cmb maps for various frequency bands of wmap , which show the variation of the statistic at various degree of contamination of the signal by the galaxy .",
    "those peculiarities in the properties of the cmb temperature anisotropies have defined the strategy of our present study .",
    "namely we did as follows : once we saw that the galactic contribution can be separated in cmb maps with kolmogorov analysis due to its different degree of randomness , we modeled systems comprised of signals that differ in their randomness .",
    "such strategy in principle can help to reveal the role of a given sub - signal .",
    "although our numerical experiments deal with specific sequences , the performed analysis shows that the cmb can be in principle be separated into sub - signals using the kolmogorov statistic and the stochasticity parameter , either qualitatively or quantitatively ."
