    "we follow the evolution of the state in phase space .",
    "the initial coherent ground state is not an eigenstate of the changed potential and hence will time evolve accordingly .",

    "by @xmath0 phase imprinting the condensate in one well , the ground state centered at the origin ( 0,0 ) in phase space is displaced to the unstable equilibrium point ( 0,@xmath1 ) on the separatrix . using exact quantum time evolution within the framework of the two mode model , the resulting quantum wave - packet bifurcates as expected . if the barrier is raised as discussed below , the wave - packet is permanantly split , resulting in a superposition of two classical rotor states .      in the situation",
    "when there is no decoherence , well controlled entangled states can be generated within the two - mode quantum dynamics .",
    "as an example , figs .",
    "[ fig : cathusimil ] show how a number entangled state with 1000 particles is generated .",
    "[ fig : cathusimil ] shows the evolution in phase space using husimi projections - ( a ) the ground state , ( b ) a @xmath0-phase imprinted state , ( c ) and ( d ) show subsequent evolution in the process of bifurcating the state ; further evolution along with a change of barrier totally splits and traps the state symmetrically above the separatrix , as shown in ( e ) , finally giving rise to an entangled state in ( f ) . here",
    "the barrier height is ramped up in time as @xmath85 .",
    "when an entangled state is reached the barrier is suddenly raised to essentially halt the evolution . with different initial barrier heights and the same ramping of the potential , the extremity of the entangled states can be tuned .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : catcomparel ] where the different values of the barrier heights are @xmath86 , @xmath85 and @xmath87 for rows ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively .",
    "the columns show : ( a ) the barrier height and the ramping , ( b ) the respective ground state , ( c ) the final entangled state at the end of the ramping , and ( d ) a close view of the coefficients for the final state shows that these are rather sharply peaked entangled states .",
    "as is evident from the pictures , the initial squeezing of the ground state determines the extremity of the final entangled state . the rate at which the barrier is ramped determines the sharpness .",
    "macroscopic superposition states are not observed mainly due to interaction with the environment . in elastic collisions where the total number of atom is conserved , phase damping destroys the quantum coherence  @xcite . in the case where the number of particles are not conserved",
    ", the loss of even a single particle destroys an extreme entangled state  @xcite , as can be seen with the operation of a destruction operator to such a state @xmath88    the robustness of the entangled states is tested with such a loss scheme .",
    "it is likely that particles from the condensate will be lost during the evolution of the state when the barrier is raised .",
    "this is simulated by the operation of the destruction operator at different time intervals during the evolution and taking particles out randomly from either well at each time .",
    "[ fig : loss ] shows different realizations of loss of different number of particles from the least extreme entangled state example in fig .",
    "[ fig : catcomparel ] , third row .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) are two different simulations for a loss of 10 particles during the evolution .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show two different runs for a loss of 30 particles from the same entangled state .",
    "results for extreme entangled states are not shown here as such states are totally destroyed , meaning all the particles are localized in one well .",
    "the simulations suggests that a less extreme entangled state is more robust , so it may be desirable to sacrifice the extremity of a cat state in order for it to survive in a realistic laboratory setting . to compare the effects of loss for sharpness , an entangled state which is not sharp and has a gaussian spread has a better chance of having nonvanishing coefficients after the loss of particles .",
    "so the most robust state would be a less extreme entangled state with a gaussian width of coefficients around the two peaks .",
    "the coherence is not lost in destroying particles in the fashion done here - this is evident in the density matrix  @xcite for panel ( a ) as shown in panel ( e ) . the off - diagonal peaks in the density matrix that quantifies the coherence remains a geometric mean of the diagonal elements since we have not introduced phase damping ; coherence vanishes only when the final state is localized in one well .      during our development of the quantum phase space picture for the double well bec since 2002  @xcite , several other authors have also noted that metastable quantum states and dynamical instability can be exploited to produce entangled states in a double well  @xcite and in a spinor condensate  @xcite .",
    "all these findings are consistent with the phase space model introduced in this paper ; our demonstration of the tunability and sharpening of the entangled states in a double well setting provides a useful improvement which may be important for experimental detection and other practical purposes .",
    "the wigner distribution function , the gaussian average of which is the husimi distribution , has also emerged as a valuable tool to the description of entangled state generation in a spinor condensate  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a quantum mechanical phase space picture of a double - well bose - einstein condensate in the two - mode approximation . in a mean - field approximation",
    ", the two - mode hamiltonian reduces to the hamiltonian of a nonrigid physical pendulum .",
    "examination of the husimi projections of the stationary quantum states reveals how the mean - field classical phase space follows directly from quantum mechanics .",
    "we have found eigenstate structures that are localized like classical oscillating states , free - rotor states and @xmath0 states .",
    "the husimi probability distribution turns out to be an extremely useful tool to study becs in a double - well . through its study",
    "we found unifying connections and new insights into the double well phase space and its dynamics .",
    "for a driven double well , quantum states are found to diffuse into the chaotic region of phase space analogous to classical chaos .",
    "a @xmath0 phase imprinted condensate put on an unstable fixed point of the classical phase space bifurcates along the separatrix if allowed to time evolve .",
    "the extremity and the sharpness of the entangled states produced in this scheme can be tuned with the initial barrier height and the appropriate ramping of the potential .",
    "the model developed here may find applications in the studies of other double well bec dynamics , such as in a study of asymmetric wells , effects of change of scattering lengths , transitions connected to avoided crossings , topics in quantum chaos and studies of the effects of decoherence ."

    "<S> we present a quantum phase space model of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a double well potential . in a quantum two - mode approximation </S>",
    "<S> we examine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and find that the energy correlation diagram indicates a transition from a delocalized to a fragmented regime . </S>",
    "<S> phase space information is extracted from the stationary quantum states using the husimi distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mean - field phase space characteristics of a nonrigid physical pendulum arises from the exact quantum states , and that only 4 to 8 particles per well are needed to reach the semiclassical limit . for a driven double well bec , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the classical chaotic dynamics is manifest in the dynamics of the quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> phase space analogy also suggests that a @xmath0 phase displaced wavepacket put on the unstable fixed point on a separatrix bifurcates to create a superposition of two pendulum rotor states - a macroscopic superposition state of bec . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the choice of initial barrier height and ramping , following a @xmath0 phase imprinting on the condensate , can be used to generate controlled entangled number states with tunable extremity and sharpness . </S>"
