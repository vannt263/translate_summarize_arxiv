    "since the 1950s several authors investigated the ( integrated ) telegraph process as a realistic model of random motion ( see goldstein @xcite , bartlett @xcite and kac @xcite ) .",
    "such process describes a motion of a particle on the real line characterized by constant speed , the direction being reversed at the random epochs of a poisson process .",
    "the probability density of the particle s position satisfies a hyperbolic differential equation , whose probabilistic properties have been studied for instance by orsingher @xcite , @xcite , foong and kanno @xcite , and more recently by beghin _",
    "see also the book of pinsky @xcite , in which many results on the telegraph process and its generalizations were given , and many applications were discussed .",
    "certain one - dimensional generalizations of the telegraph process focus on cases in which the intertimes between two consecutive changes of direction are characterized by a variety of distributions .",
    "we recall the case of erlang distribution ( di crescenzo @xcite ) , of gamma distribution ( di crescenzo and martinucci @xcite ) , of the exponential distribution with linearly increasing rate ( di crescenzo and martinucci @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a generalized telegraph process governed by an alternating renewal process was studied by zacks @xcite , whereas iacus @xcite gave a rare example where an explicit probability law is obtained for an inhomogeneous telegraph process .    in this paper",
    "we aim to study the telegraph model subject to a further source of randomness , by assuming that the velocity of the moving particle is driven by random trials .",
    "precisely , we deal with a two - velocity random motion on the real line where , differently from the classical telegraph process whose positive and negative velocities are alternating , at each time epoch now the new velocity is determined by the outcome of a random trial .",
    "the latter follows one out of two schemes : the _ bernoulli scheme _ , which acts with independence , and the classical _ plya scheme _",
    "plya @xcite , mahmoud @xcite ) , where the outcome of each trial depends on the outcomes of the previous ones .",
    "we remark that the inclusion of random trials in finite - velocity random evolutions allows to describe some real situations of interest , such as the motions of particles subject to collisions , whose effects may produce direction changes .",
    "some novelties with respect to various finite - velocity random motions are mentioned in section 2 , with special reference to models with random velocities .",
    "we recall that investigations on the telegraph process with random velocities have been performed recently by stadje and zacks @xcite , and by de gregorio @xcite .",
    "moreover , some recent contributions on multidimensional motions characterized by finite speed and randomly distributed directions are given in de gregorio @xcite , and de gregorio and orsingher @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe in detail the mathematical model of the motion . in section [ gen - results ] , we investigate the probability law and the conditional mean velocity of the process . then , in section [ bernoulli - case ] , for the bernoulli scheme we discuss the instance in which the random intertimes between consecutive trials are exponentially distributed with linearly increasing rates . in this case",
    "we obtain the probability density of the process in closed form , we show that it possesses a logistic stationary density , and then express the conditional mean velocity of the process in terms of hypergeometric functions . finally , in section",
    "[ polya - case ] , we show a case for the plya scheme in which the first random intertimes in both directions are gamma - distributed , whereas all remaining intertimes are exponentially distributed . we obtain the probability density in closed form and the conditional mean velocity as series of gauss hypergeometric functions . for the reader",
    "s convenience , the paper is enriched by two appendices containing definitions and formulas used in the proofs .",
    "let @xmath0 be a continuous - time stochastic process , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote respectively position and velocity at time @xmath3 of the moving particle .",
    "the motion is characterized by two velocities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , the direction of the motion being specified by the sign of the velocity . at time",
    "@xmath7 the particle starts from the origin , thus @xmath8 .",
    "the initial velocity @xmath9 is determined by the outcome @xmath10 of the first random trial . at the random time",
    "@xmath11 the particle is subject to an event , whose effect possibly changes the velocity according to the outcome @xmath12 of the second random trial .",
    "this behavior is repeated cyclically at every instant of a sequence of random epochs @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the durations of time intervals @xmath14 , @xmath15 , constitute a sequence of non - negative random variables .",
    "precisely , let @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) denote the random duration of the @xmath18-th time period during which the particle moves forward , with velocity @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "backward , with velocity @xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are mutually independent sequences of non - negative and absolutely continuous independent random variables . denoting by @xmath21 the velocity of the particle during the interval @xmath14 , we assume that @xmath22 is a sequence of random variables governed by the sequence @xmath23 of the outcomes of the random trials .",
    "moreover we assume that the collection @xmath24 is independent of @xmath25 .",
    "in this paper we focus on the case in which the random trials @xmath23 are the outcomes of a sequence of indicator functions such that @xmath26 and for @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are positive constants , @xmath31 is a non - negative constant , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath27 .",
    "we can distinguish two different cases .",
    "* the case @xmath34 , which means that the random trials @xmath25 are independent , i.e. they are a _ bernoulli scheme _ with parameter @xmath35 * the case @xmath36 , which means that @xmath25 are the outcomes of a sequence of drawings from an urn which initially has @xmath29 black balls and @xmath30 red balls and then is updated according to the _ classical plya urn scheme _ : the drawn ball is returned into the urn together with @xmath36 balls of the same color . of the model",

    "( not necessarily integer ) . ]",
    "( @xmath37 means that the drawn ball is black ; otherwise we have @xmath38 . ) in this case the random trials @xmath25 are not independent , but only exchangeable ( see aldous @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that urn schemes are used in many applications in order to model the so - called _ preferential attachment principle _ , which is a key feature governing the dynamics of many economic , social and biological systems .",
    "it can be formulated as follows : the greater the number of times we observed a certain event , the higher is the probability of occurrence of that event at next time .",
    "+ in section [ sect : reinforced ] we discuss an extension of the above setting to the case in which @xmath23 is the sequence of the outcomes of drawings from a _ randomly reinforced urn_.    we notice that stadje and zacks @xcite studied a telegraph process with random velocities , where at each epoch of a homogeneous poisson process the new velocity of the motion is chosen according to a common density , independently of the previous velocities and of the poisson process .",
    "hence , in particular the velocities are a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables and , in section 5 of @xcite , the first - exit time of the process through a positive constant is investigated in the special case of 2-valued random velocities .",
    "this schema corresponds to the case ( i ) described above , where at each random epoch a bernoulli trial occurs .",
    "however , there is a significant difference : whereas in @xcite the random durations are independent of the random velocities , our model is based on more general assumptions , which involve non - identically distributed durations of random intervals @xmath39 , depending on the values taken by the velocities .",
    "moreover our model includes the case ( ii ) of not independent random velocities .",
    "these two facts are also novelties with respect to de gregorio @xcite where , as in @xcite , a homogeneous poisson process governs the velocity changes that form a sequence of i.i.d .  random variables , independent of the poisson process .",
    "let @xmath40 be the stochastic process which counts the number of epochs @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) occurring before @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath43 it is worthwhile to note that position and velocity of the particle at time @xmath3 can thus be formally expressed as : @xmath44 figure 1 shows two examples of sample paths of @xmath45 , with indication of the random intertimes @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where the sequence @xmath23 takes values _ ( a ) _ @xmath48 and _ ( b ) _",
