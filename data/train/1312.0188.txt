    "for an open quantum system , the dissipation process must be accompanied by entanglement generation , i.e. the populations of quantum states are altered due to entanglement with an external environment . thus researchers are dedicating themselves to find efficient ways avoiding decoherence during quantum information process .",
    "currently , the feasible methods include an active error - correction approach based on the assumption that the most probable errors occur independently to a few qubits , which can be corrected via subsequent quantum operation @xcite , and alternative passive error - prevention scheme , where the logical qubits are encoded into subspaces which do not decohere because of symmetry @xcite .",
    "recently , the function of dissipation is reexamined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the environment along can be used as a resource to preparing entanglement and implementing universal quantum computing . in particular , kastoryano _ et al .",
    "_ consider a dissipative scheme for preparing a maximally entangled state of two @xmath2-atoms in a high finesse optical cavity @xcite , in which a pure steady singlet state is achieved with no need of state initialization .    compared with other kinds of entanglement ,",
    "high - dimensional entangled states have attracted much interest , since it can enhance the violations of local realism and the security of quantum cryptography . in the fields of linear optics ,",
    "two experiments utilize the spatial modes of the electromagnetic field carrying orbital angular momentum to create high - dimensional entanglement . in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ,",
    "three - dimensional entanglement has also been realized in the unitary evolutionary dynamics based on resonant , and dispersive atom - cavity interactions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we put forward a dissipative method for preparing a stationary three - dimensional entangled state .",
    "the motivation of our proposal is mainly based on the following truth : the typical decoherence factors in cavity qed system consist of atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay , which have detrimental effects on schemes based on unitary dynamics .",
    "however , the loss of cavity can used to stabilize a pure maximally entangled state when a suitable feedback control is applied @xcite .",
    "thus the spontaneous emission of atom becomes the only one detrimental factor .",
    "the result of our work shows that atomic spontaneous emission is able to be a useful resource in respect of entanglement preparation , especially the fidelity of target state can even be better than the unitary evolution based schemes .",
    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows .",
    "we derive the lindblad master equation for preparation of three - dimensional entangled state with effective operator method in section ii .",
    "we then generalize the scheme to realization of an @xmath1-dimensional entangled state via introducing multi - level atoms and multi - mode cavity and discuss the effect of cavity decay on the fidelity in section iii .",
