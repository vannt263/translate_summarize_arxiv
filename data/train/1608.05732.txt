    "real gas offers an alternative for the modelling of quintessence and of the cosmic inflation .",
    "quintessence is a dynamical , evolving , spatially - inhomogeneous component with negative pressure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is characterised by an equation of state @xmath0 linking the pressure @xmath1 to the energy density @xmath2 via the parameter @xmath3 which , for most models , is a constant such that @xmath4 .",
    "dust is modelled by @xmath5 , radiation  by @xmath6 , stiff matter  by @xmath7 , the cosmological constant or vacuum energy  by @xmath8 , etc .",
    "a spectrum of other possibilities for @xmath3 are also allowed , including an equation of state which is uniformly evolving or oscillatory .",
    "+ commonly considered quintessential cosmology models are based on the introduction of a spatially - inhomogeneous slowly - evolving real scalar field rolling down a potential similar to the inflaton field in inflation theory .",
    "the pressure of the scalar field is negative if it rolls down so slowly that the kinetic energy density is smaller than the potential energy density .",
    "alternative quintessence models introduce the real gas equation of state .",
    "it has an advantage over an ideal gas equation of state , since it takes into account possible phase transitions between the thermodynamic states of cosmic fluids . in some epochs of the cosmological evolution",
    ", two phases could have existed together .",
    "the van der waals equation of state , for example , describes a two phase fluid .",
    "the scenario of van der waals cosmology has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . another possible model based on the virial expansion gas equation has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "+ employing methods from the theory of hamiltonian dynamical systems , a discussion of the time evolution of the solutions of two models , based on van der waals and virial gas cosmologies , is presented in this paper .",
    "the cosmological variables used are the expansion rate , given by the hubble parameter , and the energy density .",
    "hamiltonian formulation of the nonlinear governing equations is presented for both models under consideration .",
    "such formulation is possible because of the existence of global first integrals in these non - linear models and these conserved quantities allow detailed analysis .",
    "in particular , it leads to explicit solutions for special initial conditions , corresponding to special values of the conserved quantities .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : a brief cosmological set - up is followed by basic formulation of the real virial gas model and the van der waals model .",
    "after some basic canonical hamiltonian formulation tools are introduced , an illustration is made with a dynamic self - interaction model @xcite whose hamiltonian structure has been revealed .",
    "the two main sections focus on the hamiltonian formulations of the real virial gas and , separately , of the van der waals gas , together with a thorough analysis of the trajectories in the phase plane , focusing in particular to closed curves which represent cyclic universe scenarios .",
    "the expansion of a homogeneous universe , modelled with a perfect fluid , is adiabatic ( except in the early universe when particle annihilation `` pumps '' heat and adiabaticity is temporarily lost ) . in general , a perfect fluid is characterised by equation of state of the type @xmath9 .",
    "however , in view of the adiabaticity , the fluid flow must be reversible ( isentropic ) .",
    "this necessitates a _",
    "barotropic _ equation of state @xmath10 or motion of the fluid in a way that such relation effectively holds : only then the general case of two dynamical variables @xmath2 and @xmath11 reduces effectively to one @xcite .",
    "a barotropic fluid is an idealised situation and the relationship @xmath10 is considered to be known in advance @xcite .",
    "most of the important cosmological models , which include fluids and are dominant in different cosmological epochs , are barotropic .",
    "+ if the gas is isothermal and ideal , then @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 const is the isothermal speed of sound ) . alternatively , if the gas is isentropic and ideal , then @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 const which ensures adiabaticity and @xmath16 is the ratio of the specific heats @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "+ following earlier work @xcite , firstly , real gas is considered whose pressure @xmath1 is related to the particle number @xmath18 , the temperature @xmath11 , and the volume @xmath19 of the gas via the virial expansion @xcite : [ vir ] p = .",
    "the @xmath20 term in this expansion corrects the ideal gas equation of state ( @xmath21 ) and is given by @xcite : f(t ) = 2 _ 0^ r^2 dr , where @xmath22 is the two - particle interaction potential .",
    "+ interactions involving three or more particles [ the term @xmath23 and beyond ] will not be considered .",
    "+ the two - particle interactions , which are slightly attractive at long distances and strongly repulsive at short range , are often viewed in regularized form : ensemble of identical  hard spheres \" of radius @xmath24 , surrounded by square potential wells of width @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and depth @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 ) .",

    "another parameter of the model will be temperature @xmath11 .",
    "however , @xmath11 will be allowed to vary , and the different values of this parameter , would characterise different epochs and the evolution of the trajectories in the phase - plane of the dynamical system .",
    "this means that a barotropic equation of state is considered , along the lines of that of an ideal gas , and does not mean that the temperature is forced to be constant .",
    "the treatment of the situation is analogical to that in the standard case of varying equation of state of an ideal gas : in priciple , the ratio @xmath34 changes with time but it is assumed that any time derivatives of @xmath3 are negligible in comparison to those of @xmath2  a reasonable assumption given that the equation of state is derived microphysically and is not linked to the expansion of the universe .",
    "+ the hamiltonian structure of this model will be revealed and analysis of the trajectories in the plase plane further studied .",
    "+ in this work , the van der waals quintessence scenario of capozziello _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite will also be revisited and hamiltonian formulation established .",

    "+ dynamical phase - plane analysis ( with hubble s parameter @xmath44 and density of the real gas @xmath2 as dynamical variables ) of a real virial gas model have shown @xcite that there is initial data leading to a cyclic universe solution that goes through an inflationary phase in each cycle , together with open trajectories in the phase plane that may or may not pass through regions characterized by inflation .",
    "as the universe cools down , the inflationary region on the phase plane decreases and eventually disappears in the limit @xmath45 @xcite . the cosmological model presented in @xcite also does not exhibit an endless sequence of cycles of expansion and contraction .",
    "the trajectory of the universe on the phase place is , in first approximation , an ellipse and the frequency of oscillations decreases , while the ratio of of its axes decreases as the universe is cooling with periodicity eventually lost .",

    "the canonical hamiltonian formulation necessitates canonical coordinates , which could be obtained from the physical ones with a nonlinear change ( transformation ) of variables .",
    "it turns out that the coordinate transformation to canonical variables can be singular at some of the possible equilibrium points .",
