    "recently , the new polarization transfer data for the electromagnetic form factors ratio @xmath1 @xcite raised a lot of interest for the two photon exchange ( tpe ) physics in elastic electron proton scattering .",

    "two model calculations exist for the real part of the tpe amplitude @xcite , and they qualitatively confirm that the exchange of two hard photons may be responsible for this discrepancy . in order to extract the electric form factor in the model independent way , one has thus to study the general case of compton scattering with two spacelike photons .",

    "these checks have been done for the existing data .",
    "inclusion of the elastic ( nucleon ) intermediate state only @xcite led to negative asymmetry of several ppm in the kinematics of sample experiment but was not enough to describe the data .",
    "the description of the beam normal spin asymmetry within a phenomenological model which uses the full set of the single pion electroproduction @xcite did not give satisfactory description at any of the available kinematics .",
    "especially intriguing appears the situation with the sample data with electron lab energy @xmath4 mev , which is just above the pion production threshold where the theoretical input is well understood .",
    "on the other hand , an eft calculation without dynamical pions @xcite was somewhat surprisingly very successful in describing this kinematics for @xmath3 .",
    "this success suggests that to the given order of chiral perturbation theory , the role of the dynamical pions for this observable might be not too large .",

    "we observe that the double logarithmic enhancement is not a consequence of taking the forward limit but a pure kinematical effect within the loop integral .",
    "we demonstrate that this treatment of the problem leads to much smaller values for this asymmetry than those quoted in @xcite .",
    "we provide furthermore a clear explanation of this discrepancy .",
    "in fact , it is a consequence of the well known fact that the forward doubly virtual compton scattering amplitude has a non - analytic behaviour in the real photon point @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the virtuality of the incoming and outgoing photons . by now , it has been noticed for the low energy limit of the real and ( doubly ) virtual compton scattering , where even the leading terms in the low energy expansion are sensitive to the order of taking either the low energy limit @xmath12 or @xmath13 first @xcite .",

    "the physical scattering can only occur inside this region .",
    "the forward line crosses the @xmath0 axis at @xmath155 , while the backward line at @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath157-channel ( crossed compton reaction ) kinematical regions are obtaine by @xmath158 .",
    "the variable @xmath26 should not be confused with the energy of the virtual photon , which is sometimes denoted as @xmath26 , as well . in the lab frame , the initial photon energy is given by @xmath159 , while @xmath160 , with @xmath161 the invariant mass squared of the intermediate hadronic state .",
    "for each value of the external variables @xmath94 and @xmath0 which one measures in a @xmath2-scattering experiment , the integral over the intermediate electron phase space involves @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the latter integral is performed over the ellyptic areas shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinbounds ] , unambiguously defined by @xmath94 , @xmath0 and @xmath50 . in terms of the mandelstam plot in fig .",
    "[ vvcs_mandelstam ] , this corresponds to integrating over a series of such mandelstam plots for each pair of @xmath164 at the value of @xmath0 fixed by the experimental kinematics . in the special case of @xmath165",
    "which is always contained within the integral , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinbounds ] , the mandelstam plot is deformed , so that the forward line becomes @xmath15 . if @xmath166 , however , @xmath15 is only approached asymptotically for @xmath167 .",
    "this is the reason why the limit @xmath140 is not well defined for the general case of the doubly virtual compton scattering : this limit takes one outside of the physical region of the reaction .",
    "if one preforms the limit @xmath139 first , keeping @xmath168 , one enssures that the line @xmath15 is contained within the physical region , and the limit can be performed . + technically , the difference between the two limits originates from treating as small quantity either the momentum transfer ( forward doubly vcs ) or the virtualities of the photons ( rcs ) .",
    "we note that the squared logarithm enhancement occurs if the hadronic amplitudes is non - zero in the exact limit of hard collinear photons .",
    "therefore , the leading ( in @xmath124 ) contribution should correspond to compton scattering with the photon virtualities of the order @xmath169 and the momentum transfer of the @xmath2 reaction which one measures on the experiment .",
    "it means that in order to justify the limit of @xcite , one has to go to external momentum transfers smaller than @xmath170 which is of the order of @xmath171 gev@xmath92 in the kinematics considered here .",
    "apart from difficulty in achieving this kinematics experimentally , it is suppressed by the kinematical factors in the general expression of eq.([eq : bn_general])for @xmath3 , which ensures this observable to vanish in the exact forward direction .",
    "basing on these considerations , we see that in order to obtain adequate estimate of the double log effect for @xmath3 , one has to split the full doubly virtual compton amplitude into the non - forward real compton amplitude which gives the desirable effect , plus the rest which is regular in the qrcs point and can at most give a @xmath172 effect .",
    "in summary , we presented a calculation of the beam normal spin asymmetry in the kinematical regime of high energies ( @xmath173 gev ) and low momentum transfer to the target , @xmath174 ( gev / c)@xmath92 .",
    "this observable obtains its leading contribution from the imaginary part of the two photon exchange graph times the born amplitude and is directly related to the imaginary part of doubly virtual compton scattering the resulting loop integral obtains a large contribution from the kinematics when both exchanged photons are nearly real and collinear to the external electrons .",
    "we adopt the qrcs or equivalent photons approximation which allows to take the hadronic part in the external kinematics out of the integral and to perform the integration over the electron phase space analytically . for the hadronic part",
    ", we use the full real compton scattering amplitude and show , that both forward ( no proton and photon helicity flip ) and backward ( photon helicity flipping ) amplitudes do contribute in this observable in the forward kinematics . for the forward compton amplitude , we use optical theorem as the input . for backward compton amplitude , we provide an explicite calculation which is due to two pion exchange in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "the resulting values of the asymmetry are in the range @xmath175 ppm for the energies in the range @xmath176 gev .",
    "we find furthermore that the double logarithmic enhancement does not dominate @xmath3 in forward regime since it comes with helicity - flip compton amplitude which highly suppresses this behaviour .",
    "finally , we make an interesting observation that the non - analyticity of the doubly virtual compton scattering leads to the order dependence of taking limits @xmath140 and @xmath139 , which is a generalization of the known problem of matching the low energy limits of real and doubly virtual compton scattering .",

    "the vector and tensor integrals can be reduced to the scalar ones by means of standard methods @xcite .",
    "the remaining integrals to be calculated are the two , three , and four - point scalar integrals . here",
    "we are only interested in the imaginary part of these , therefore there are only three integrals with non - zero imaginary part : the two - point integral c^_0&=&im + & = & , with @xmath196 ; the three - point one b^_0&=&im + & & + & = & - , and finally , the four - point integral : a^_0&=&im + & & + & = & + & & .",
