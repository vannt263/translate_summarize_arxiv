    "the penna model @xcite is a one of variety of mutation accumulation models .",
    "they are based on assumption that biological ageing is caused by deleterious mutations in genome ( it is inherited from parent  asexual model  and enriched by additional mutations put at random site at genome at the birth moment ) .    the number of genetic families in the population decreases as the time grows .",
    "this was described for example in papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the effect of the reduction in number of genetic families is also responsible for sharp and irregular maxima in the mutation distribution function after many time steps of computer simulation .",
    "this effect is discussed in the main text .",
    "in the model presented , individuals genome is represented as a string of bits , where @xmath9 means presence of mutation , and @xmath10  lack of mutation . when an individual reaches age @xmath11 , only the first @xmath11 bits are exposed .",
    "the number of `` ones '' in that part of genome are considered as active mutations @xmath12 .",
    "when the number @xmath12 of active mutations exceeds a threshold @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( one of the model parameters )  the individual dies due to genetic reason .",
    "another important parameter is @xmath15  minimal reproduction age  only individuals with @xmath16 can give offspring .",
    "that causes some genomes not to be reproduced , because its owner dies before reaching mature age .",
    "this is the basic implementation of darwinian evolution mechanism .",
    "there is also another reason of death incorporated into the model ",
    "death due to overpopulation ",
    "controlled by so called verhulst factor .",
    "the probability of such death equals to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is number of individuals in time step @xmath2 , and @xmath19 is the environmental capacity ( which is constant during the simulation ) .",
    "this factor limits the population size .",
    "we start the simulation with population which has no mutations ( genome length is @xmath20 bits ) .",
    "it takes several hours using pentium iii class machine . in each time step :    * each individual is tested against possible death , due to : * * genetic reason , when @xmath14 ; * * verhulst factor with probability @xmath17 ; * if individual survived and reached age @xmath15 , it gives birth to @xmath21 babies on average , so @xmath21 is the birth rate .",
    "each descendant gets the genome inherited from parent , enriched by @xmath22 new mutations .",
    "( if one of the @xmath22 mutation attempts hits an already mutated bit , this bit stays as it is . ) * all survivals and newly born individuals make up population at the next time step .",
    "by a population structure we mean set of parameters , we use to characterize it .",
    "the first one is the survival factor : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is number of individuals of age @xmath11 at time @xmath2 .",
    "this survival factor is interpreted as a probability that individual which has age @xmath11 , enters the next time step @xmath25 . from this",
    " we can obtain mortality rate : @xmath26    we can separate mortality for two elements  mortality because of verhulst factor , and mortality because of achieving threshold @xmath13 by number of active mutations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is number of individuals killed because of verhulst factor , and @xmath29 is number of deaths caused by genetic reason .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is age - independent , whereas @xmath31 gives approximately dependency : @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants ) which is known as gompertz law @xcite .",
    "it is an empirical law observed also in human population ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : struct1000 ] presents results after @xmath35 time - steps of simulation ( averages from last 20 steps ) , when the average number of births equals average numbers of deaths . as can be seen at the chart in the right top corner ",
    "gompertz law is fulfilled ( it presents @xmath36 ) .",
    "the chart at the right down corner , presents the average number of mutations versus bit position .",
    "low values at the beginning are the effect of evolution mechanism , that eliminates genotypes with big number of mutations at this part of genome ( individuals with such genome can not reproduce because they die before reaching age @xmath15 ) . as it can be seen in the next section , at this case",
    "the population is quite diverse and the result significantly differs from that after @xmath0 steps ( the same parameters , figure [ fig : struct20000 ] ) .",
    "the population characteristics presented in the previous section ( after @xmath35 steps ) could lead us to misleading conclusions .",
    "average number of birth acts and average number of deaths are equals ( and what follows ",
    "average population size does not change ) , so it may look like a stationary state . indeed , it is so in terms of the population size , however the evolution is still shifting the genome distribution function",
    ". the proportions of participation of particular genotypes in population are changing .",
    "it is so since first we need to define the criterion with respect to which the close - to - stationary state is claimed . if the total population @xmath18 is considered , one hundred iterations may be enough .",
    "however if we mean overall characteristics of genomes , it is far from the equilibrium and we must proceed simulation for many thousands steps .",
    "there are different time scales for different features observed in population .    to distinguish between different genotypes  we introduced a special marker of individuals .",
    "at the beginning of simulation  each individual inserted into environment , has given unique number . when individual gives birth  the marker is inherited by progeny .",
    "the marker is kept fixed which makes it possible to trace the evolution of different genetic families ( by genetic family we mean set of individuals with the same marker ) .",
    "figure [ fig : struct20000 ] presents results of simulation after @xmath0 steps ( this is the continuation of simulation presented at the previous section ) . peaks in mutations distribution  the right down corner  suggest that the population became more homogeneous . to check our hypothesis we plotted the number @xmath1 of genetic families versus the time step ",
    "full squares at figure [ fig : glines ] ( double log scale ) .",
    "as can be seen it diminishes rapidly  and after about @xmath37 steps becomes a power function of time .    in our case",
    " starting with as many as @xmath38 genetic families , after about @xmath0 steps we got three families in environment . for a long time",
    "run we get results presented in figure [ fig : bigsim ] .",
    "as it was mentioned earlier , we observe that @xmath1 dependency is : @xmath39 it seems to be independent on penna model parameters as long as we not approach to the logistic model  empty squares at figure [ fig : glines ] ( by logistic model , we mean model where the only reason of death is overpopulation , no genetic factor is present ) .",
    "this result is compatible with results described in @xcite but with one exception . in our simulations",
    "@xmath40 for asexual model ( @xmath41 for logistic one ) , while in literature @xmath41 is claimed .",
    "we suppose that this discrepancy is caused by the fact , that we start simulation with much bigger initial population , and so we have had a chance to achieve the @xmath40 region , that is before the population is extinct .",
    "our three families as the final result , is rather an effect of under - counting the simulation .",
    "if the simulation time is sufficiently big , the number of families achieves @xmath9 every time  see figure [ fig : bigsim ] .",
    "this phenomena is known as `` eve effect '' .",
    "what is more , the @xmath1 curve achieves @xmath41 region again at the end .",
    "so there are three stages of that play : @xmath42 from the start , to several hundred time - steps , then @xmath43 until time reaches about @xmath44 steps , and final @xmath42 ( figure [ fig : bigsim ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize , that whole `` s - shape '' effect does not occur in sexual model . in that case",
    " whole curve is without any transitions , and has an exponent equals @xmath42 ( what remains in accordance with results presented in @xcite ) .    we suppose that an important role in the presented `` eve effect '' plays the verhulst factor . this is the only way which one family can influence on another .",
    "when one family accidently outnumbers another  it can produce more new individuals filling up the environment , and death because of overpopulation makes not as big damage as in less numerous families .",
    "interesting could be the introduction of some mechanism into the model , that allows for exchanges between families which may change the final result .",
    "different mechanisms leading to elimination of individuals gives insight to the evolution game .",
    "the verhulst factor , however , was introduced in the past as a remedy to avoid unlimited growth of population .",
    "it was not devised to account for specific death cause such as disease , genetic death , hunting etc .",
    "when we go for more detailed modeling , one should replace the overall verhulst factor by more specific mechanisms .",
    "some papers are devoted to this problem .",
    "the deterministic case of two families is discussed in @xcite , and verhulst factors are completely removed in @xcite .",
    "we explore modification introduced in @xcite  a dynamic version of birth rate which helps to keep the size of the population stable and finite .",
    "the birth rate changes in each time - step according to rule :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is constant ( set at the beginning of simulation ) .",
    "the next change is an elimination of the verhulst factor as a possible cause of death  individuals death occurs only because of genetic reasons .",
    "a comparison of results of the two simulation  standard and modified penna model  is presented in figure [ fig : glines2 ]    simulations were done for the same set of parameters as presented before , except @xmath47 for the modified model ( matched to get comparable results ) and @xmath48 . as can be seen",
    ", there is a _ plateau _ at the initial time range in @xmath1 dependency , in the modified model . at the rest of time",
    "range  dependencies are similar .",
    "the eve effect is still present .",
    "it seems , that replacing verhulst factor by dynamic birth rate does not change this fact .",
    "the early stage simulation , up to about several hundred steps , corresponds to the phase of already established size of the population and still far from the stationary bad mutation distribution ( at least for the assumed rate of the bad mutations ) .",
    "then the genetic death rate is not a dominant factor as yet , and so the model follow the rules more as if the logistic scheme which ignores genetic death factor only .",
    "that is why we may expect the @xmath49 coefficient as predicted by the logistic model .    when continuous pumping in the bad mutations yields a sort of saturation in the bad mutation accumulations for simulation lasting long enough ( say @xmath35 steps or so ) ,",
    "the genetic death may prevail and we are inclined to associate the @xmath50 coefficient with this region .    unavoidably , however we approach the final equilibrium with one family only . obviously this very final stage is @xmath7 and so we may anticipate a smooth transition from @xmath51 to @xmath7 when the number of families drop down to small number of a few competing families .",
    "the one only final family confirms the known effect of marginal stability of different families , when competing in a limited environment in the logistic model .",
    "once the genetic death is switched on ( like in the penna - like model ) , the competition leads to elimination of the weaker groups .",
    "the time scale of this process is of order of @xmath52 steps , so we need to carry on the many simulation steps before finally the eve emerges as the only representative family of the whole population .",
    "the last section on modified penna model proves that the value of the exponent @xmath4 in the power law @xmath53 is indeed model - dependent . in short ,",
    "the penna model with birth rate controlled by the current size of the population leads to plateau @xmath7 , asexual penna model yields @xmath49 , at the beginning several hundred of steps .",
    "special thanks are due to prof .",
    "dietrich stauffer .",
    "his continuous interest in the quality and reliability of the results claimed by us , led him to significant contributions towards our findings ; he also did the simulation himself and generously offered the results to us .",
    "figure [ fig : bigsim ] was produced using his result ( upper and lower curves ) as well as ours ( the middle lines ) ."
