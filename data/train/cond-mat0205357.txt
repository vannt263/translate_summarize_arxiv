    "for large systems in a metastable state the rate of nucleation of droplets of the stable phase is proportional to system size , in other words the average time of formation of the first stable nucleus in a quasi - stationary metastable system may be expected to be inversely proportional to its size . at first sight",
    "this may convey the impression that one might shorten metastable lifetimes as much as one would like , just by making systems very large , but this is certainly too simplistic . on a large lake at a temperature slightly below freezing",
    ", a few ice crystals will be formed instantly , which subsequently will continue growing .",
    "but if the density of these crystals is very small it will still take a very long time for the lake to freeze over completely .",
    "in such cases the nucleation time may be defined as the average time it takes an arbitrary site in the system to become included in one of the growing stable regions .",
    "quantitative descriptions of this scenario have first been given by kolmogorov@xcite , johnson and mehl@xcite and avrami@xcite .",
    "the main resulting effect is a reduction of the effective free energy barrier for nucleation by a factor of @xmath3 , or slightly smaller , depending on the details of the growth dynamics , in @xmath4 dimensions .    yet , for large , but not too large systems nucleation is brought about by the first nucleation core reaching supercritical size , which leads to a nucleation rate that is proportional to system size .",
    "the basic condition for this to occur is a time for growth of a supercritical nucleus throughout the system , shorter than the inverse nucleation rate .",
    "furthermore , also in even larger systems the distribution of the first nucleation time may be of great interest , in case this event will cause an immediate dramatic change of the system . as an example of this , consider a condensator with plates separated by a dielectricum in a metastable phase near a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the formation of a supercritical nucleus of the metallic phase immediately will lead to discharging of the condensator .",
    "other examples of such phenomena could include explosive chemical reactions starting after the nucleation event ( where we may generalize from nucleation resulting from phase transformation to basically any process requiring the crossing of some free energy barrier that is large compared to @xmath5 ) .    especially for these cases",
    "it is important to realize that mostly , due to the initial preparation of the system , the average time to the first nucleation in fact is longer than the inverse of the asymptotic nucleation rate .",
    "the reason is that typically metastable states are formed by a rapid quench from a stable state , in which no large clusters of the new stable phase are present .",
    "the asymptotic state with a constant nucleation rate , on the contrary requires a size distribution for the nucleating clusters assigning non - zero probability ( though small for large clusters ) to clusters of any subcritical size .",
    "this situation may be likened to an uphill turtle race where a large number of turtles is released at the bottom of a wide road leading up a hill , such that each of the turtles makes an independent random walk with a bias in the downhill direction .",
    "after a long time the turtles that have not reached the top yet will be distributed in some characteristic way along the slope , with most turtles near the bottom , but also some near the top , and an arrival frequency @xmath6 per turtle .",
    "the average time between subsequent arrivals at the top will be @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the number of remaining turtles .",
    "the average time of the first turtle to reach the top , however , will be much longer than @xmath9 , with @xmath0 the total number of turtles , due to the fact that initially all turtles are at the bottom .",
    "roughly one may say the first arrival time contains a delay contribution , which is the time needed to set up the quasi - stationary asymptotic distribution starting from the initial state .",
    "in this paper i will address the distribution of first nucleation times by approximating the nucleation process as a diffusion process in an abstract one - dimensional space , where the spatial coordinate indicates the sizes of growing nuclei .",
    "the next section gives the exact solution for a linear potential , corresponding to the case where the uphill road has constant slope .",
    "section [ sec : gen ] treats the case of a general monotonic potential , section [ sec : num ] compares predictions to results obtained by numerically solving the uphill diffusion equation and the last section contains some concluding remarks .",
    "mean first passage times have been studied for a long time for diffusion in a potential well with the possibility of escape over a potential barrier  @xcite . in one dimension explicit",
    "expressions are known . for long times",
    "the probability of survival in the well without reaching the barrier takes the exponential form @xmath10 , \\label{slong}\\ ] ] corresponding to an escape rate @xmath11 .",
    "the delay time @xmath12 will depend on the initial distribution of the diffusor , but typically be much shorter than the average escape time @xmath13 .",
    "the probability distribution of survival in the well for a diffusor starting at some well - defined initial position has been studied much less . yet",
    "the properties of this distribution , especially for a starting point at the bottom of the well are of great interest in many practical situations .",
    "we may use again our analogy of the turtle race from the bottom to the top of the hill .",
    "if we have @xmath0 independent turtles , all starting from the same initial distribution , the probability distribution for the time of first passage of the top by any of them is related to the single - turtle survival probability as    @xmath14    if @xmath15 were exponential for all times the distribution of first arrivals would be exponential likewise , with a maximum at @xmath16 and an average first arrival time inversely proportional to @xmath0 . for very short times or very large",
    "@xmath0 this clearly is unrealistic ; it ignores the fact that all turtles start at the bottom of the hill and therefore will require some minimal time before they can arrive at the top at all . obviously for short times",
    "the distribution of first arrivals has to be quite different from exponential .",
    "van kampen  @xcite has considered the case where the turtles start somewhere on the middle of the slope and describes the motion by a one dimensional diffusion equation of the form @xmath17\\right\\}.",

    "the potential has to be adjusted accordingly .",
    "] , @xmath22 describes the external potential representing the hill , and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 temperature and @xmath25 boltzmann s constant .",
    "van kampen then shows very elegantly that the distribution function for first arrival at @xmath26 , starting from @xmath19 , for very short times is given by @xmath27 however , his result is restricted to really short times and it can not be applied right away to the case where one starts from the origin , with a reflecting boundary imposed there .    here",
    "i will extend his results so as to remove these limitations .",
    "the case of a strictly linear potential is solved exactly in the present section , and in the next section short time approximations are obtained for a potential hill of general shape . in section [ sec",
    ": num ] a comparison is made to numerical solutions of the diffusion equation and it is confirmed that the approximations made in section [ sec : gen ] are asymptotically correct for short enough times .",
    "the average time of first arrival with @xmath0 turtles starting from the origin is found to decrease as @xmath1 for large @xmath0 .    to study the escape process in a potential @xmath22 one may start by considering a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) on a discrete set of points @xmath28 located at positions @xmath29 , with jump rates @xmath30 for jumps to the right and to the left respectively , defined through @xmath31}{\\exp [ \\epsilon_{+}(x)]+\\exp [ \\epsilon_{-}(x ) ] } , \\label{gamma}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 in a linear potential @xmath33 is a constant and the forward and backward jump rates @xmath34 respectively @xmath35 are constants as well . as a consequence , for each ctrw realization bringing a walker in @xmath8 steps from position @xmath19 to @xmath26 the weight equals the weight of the same realization in a symmetric ctrw with the same total jump rate @xmath36 , times @xmath37/ 2)/ \\cosh^n\\epsilon$ ] .",
    "now consider the continuum limit where @xmath38 and the jump frequency @xmath36 is related to the diffusion coefficient through @xmath39 in this limit we may identify @xmath8 with @xmath40 , and the denominator @xmath41 becomes @xmath42 , where i introduced @xmath43 the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "further , the probability density of first arrival at @xmath26 at time @xmath44 is obtained with the aid of the method of images as    @xmath45    this is a well - known result , see e.g.  ref .",
    "it confirms van kampen s short time behavior , but there is an additional damping factor which becomes important at slightly longer times .    for obtaining the first arrival time distribution for escape at @xmath46 with a reflecting boundary at @xmath47 we can use a convolution of the return probability at the origin @xmath48 with the probability density @xmath49 for first arrival at @xmath26 starting from site 1 , with an absorbing boundary condition at the origin .",
    "the latter may be calculated again by relating the ctrw in a linear potential to the symmetric ctrw .",
    "the method of images , now applied both at @xmath47 and @xmath46 , yields @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the effects of images resulting from repeated reflections were neglected , as these effects are exponentially small in the parameter @xmath52 , which should be @xmath53 .    by integrating this equation over time",
    "one finds that the total probability that a walk starting from @xmath54 will escape before returning to the origin is given by @xmath55    for calculating the time dependent probability density for return to the origin of a walk starting at site 1 one may consider a ctrw on a semi - infinite chain in a linear potential , but now with transitions from site 0 to the left forbidden ( implying that the total jump rate from site 0 is reduced to @xmath34 ) .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the probability density for a first return at time @xmath44 to an initial site different from the origin , with the additional condition that this return is from the right .",
    "one easily shows  @xcite that its laplace transform satisfies the equation @xmath57 with the solution @xmath58 where eq .",
    "[ gamma ] was used .",
    "the laplace transform for the distribution of return times at the origin now is obtained by summing a geometric series over @xmath8 returns as @xmath59^{-1 }   \\nonumber\\\\            & = & \\frac{z+\\gamma_+}{\\frac z 2 + \\gamma_+ -\\gamma _ - + \\frac 1 2   \\sqrt{z^2 + 2\\gamma   z+\\epsilon^2\\gamma^2}}. \\label{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , note that , for fixed @xmath18 , @xmath36 scales as @xmath60 as @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the expression above by @xmath36 , keeping the dominant terms in @xmath33 and using eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ epsilon ] ) and ( [ nush ] ) , we end up with @xmath62 where the superscript denotes the solution for a linear potential . in the present case @xmath63",

    "( [ pshort ] ) .",
    "for potential hills of general shape eq .",
    "( [ arr ] ) of course remains valid , but we do not have explicit solutions any more . to assess the short time behavior of the arrival time distribution we need short time approximations for the the return time distribution @xmath48 and the first arrival distribution with absorbing boundary conditions @xmath69 .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to cases in which the hill is high , i.e.  @xmath70 , the bottom of the hill is at the origin and the top at @xmath46 , there are no intermediate maxima and minima at almost the same height as the top or bottom , and the shape of the hill near bottom and top is smooth over length scales on which the potential variations are of order @xmath71 . under these conditions",
    "there are three well - separated time scales .",
    "a short timescale is given by @xmath72 , with @xmath73 a characteristic distance from the origin where the potential has increased by an amount of order @xmath71 . on this time",
    "scale an initial distribution localized near the origin approaches an equilibrium - like distribution over a potential range of a few @xmath5 around the origin .",
    "this is the range within which the major part of all turtles will be found at any time .",
    "an intermediate time @xmath74 , is set by the average time a turtle needs to get from bottom to top , in case it does not return to the bottom .",
    "this is the time scale required to establish the full metastable distribution .",

    "are well separated , though the separation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is much smaller than that between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "now one may formulate short time approximations for more general hill shapes .",

    "the probability for moving from @xmath84 to @xmath85 in a time t under specific boundary conditions @xmath86 then may be obtained as @xmath87 with @xmath88 the corresponding probability for the unbiased random walk .",
    "the average @xmath89 runs over all unbiased continuous time random walks , properly weighted , starting at @xmath84 , ending at @xmath85 and satisfying the required boundary conditions . for short times",
    "this average may be replaced by the rosenstock approximation  @xcite @xmath90 in the continuum limit this reduces to @xmath91 where the subscripts on the random walk average were omitted .",
    "( [ roscont ] ) is especially useful as an approximation for @xmath49 . for short times",
    "unbiased walks from @xmath92 to @xmath26 with absorbing boundary conditions at the origin and at @xmath46 on average spend equal time in equal intervals , except for very small neighborhoods of the end points , where the average time spent is smaller due to the absorbing boundaries .",
    "therefore the average @xmath93 may be replaced by a spatial average over the interval @xmath94 and one obtains the approximation @xmath95 with @xmath96 the spatial average of @xmath97 .    for the return probability to the origin",
    "the approximation ( [ roscont ] ) in principle could be used as well , but in this case it gives rise to somewhat cumbersome integrals involving error functions .",
    "and in fact we do nt really need this : for short times in typical cases the diffusion effectively takes place near the origin in either a linear or a quadratic potential , so one may approximate the return probability by the explicit expressions for these potentials . in the case of a linear potential this becomes eq .",

    "( [ arr ] ) , ( [ p1sh ] ) and ( [ parrsh ] ) as @xmath112 the mean first arrival time for the case of @xmath0 turtles may be found by setting the term subtracted from unity equal to @xmath2 .",

    "this is much slower indeed than the @xmath2 behavior one would find for smaller values of @xmath0 , such that typically a quasi - stationary distribution over the full slope is reached well before the first turtle escapes .",

    "for all the other potentials the results for times up to @xmath125 , with @xmath126 min@xmath127 remain within a deviation of 3% of the analytic approximation .",
    "the largest deviations occur for the cubic potential , which indeed of all potentials considered has the shortest @xmath125 ( namely @xmath128 ) .",
    "part of the deviations always are due to discretization errors , as seen already for the linear potential . but given that the numbers divided upon each other to obtain these curves , easily vary over more than a hundred orders of magnitude within the time range considered , errors of a few percent may be considered quite a good result .",
    "in this paper i obtained the short time behavior of the first arrival probability at the top of a potential hill for a diffusion process or random walk starting at the bottom .",
    "it is strongly suppressed during an initial time interval on the order of the diffusion time from bottom to top in the absence of a potential . in the continuum diffusion description",
    "it never becomes strictly zero for positive times , but it approaches zero extremely rapidly as time goes to zero .",
    "the arrival probability for very short times becomes fully independent of the shape of the potential , but the time range over which this holds becomes shorter as the potential gets higher and steeper near the origin .    for slightly longer times",
    "the inclusion of exponential damping factors in the expressions for the first arrival probability does become important . e.g.  ignoring the second derivative term in the expression for @xmath96 below eq .",
    "( refp1sh ) leads to a deviation of roughly 20% at @xmath123 for the quadratic and the inverse quadratic potential , whereas the deviations with the full expression are only about 1% .",
    "it is obvious that the delay time @xmath12 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ slong ] ) has to be of the order @xmath74 , so the factor @xmath129 is very close to unity .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath12 may be obtained from the projection of the initial distribution on the most slowly decaying eigenfunction of the diffusion equation ( [ diffeq ] ) with escape at @xmath46 .",
    "most notable is that @xmath12 in essence is independent of the precise form of the initial distribution , as long as this remains localized within a region of width @xmath73 around the origin , where the value of the potential remains less than a few @xmath5 above that in the origin .",
    "the average first arrival time for a very large number of independent random walkers , all starting at or near the bottom , does not scale as the inverse of the number of walkers @xmath0 , as one might expect on the basis of poisson statistics , but rather as @xmath130 .",
    "this may have important consequences in large metastable systems , in which the first nucleation of a stable droplet has an immediate large effect on the whole system .",
    "it is an interesting question how accurately such systems may be described by a simple model of noninteracting random walks in one dimension .",
    "a priori it is not clear that the nucleating droplets are characterized sufficiently by a single parameter giving their size , ignoring all details about their shapes .",
    "interactions between droplets may play a role , especially when their density becomes larger . and ,",
    "especially in the presence of conservation laws there may be memory effects that make a simple random walk picture inadequate .",
    "presently these questions are under investigation both numerically and analytically and we expect to report on them soon  @xcite .    with great pleasure",
