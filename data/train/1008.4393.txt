    "the  mission , launched in march of 2009 , was designed to address the important question of the frequency of earth - size planets around sun - like stars , and to characterize extrasolar transiting planets through a 3.5-year program of very precise photometric monitoring of @xmath1156000 stars @xcite .",
    "science results from the mission have already begun to appear @xcite . as shown already by ground - based surveys for transiting planets ,",
    "considerable effort is required to validate candidates detected photometrically .",
    "this is because false positives usually outnumber true planetary systems by a large factor , which is about 10:1 for the most successful surveys from the ground , but is not yet well characterized for .",
    "the follow - up efforts by the  team have been summarized by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy is often a crucial step in the vetting process , as it allows not only to measure the mass of a planet but also to examine any changes in the line profiles ( bisector spans ) that might indicate a false positive ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of the most challenging false positives to rule out include chance alignments with a background eclipsing binary ( `` blends '' ) .",
    "however , for faint candidates ( @xmath2 ) high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopy becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of telescope time . even for brighter candidates ,",
    "the reflex motion of the star due to an earth - mass planet can sometimes be below the radial - velocity detection limit , making spectroscopic confirmation very difficult or impossible .",
    "the question then becomes how to validate these candidates , particularly the ones with small planets that are precisely among the most interesting .",
    "a number of other tests have been developed that can aid in understanding the nature of the candidate , and that rely on the long - term and nearly continuous photometric monitoring of , as well as the very high astrometric precision achieved in determining the centroids of the stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these tests include : _ i ) _ verifying that alternating events have the same depth , which they may not if the signal is due to a background eclipsing binary ; _ ii ) _ checking for the presence of shallow secondary eclipses , which are common in eclipsing binaries but are not expected for the smallest planets ; _ iii ) _ checking for ellipsoidal variations , which could be another sign of a blend . _",
    "iv ) _ checking for changes in the centroid positions correlated with the brightness changes , which , if detected , might indicate a blend , or at the very least , a crowded aperture .",
    "this is a powerful diagnostic that is able to disprove many background blends .",
    "in addition to these tests , high - resolution imaging is an important tool to identify neighboring stars that might be eclipsing binaries with the potential to cause the transit - like signals .",
    "the photometric aperture of  is large enough ( typically many arc seconds across ) that it usually includes other stars in addition to the candidate , which increases the risk of such blends . in some cases , near - infrared observations with warm _",
    "spitzer _ can allow one to reject the planet hypothesis if the transit depth at 3.6@xmath3 m or 4.5@xmath3 m is significantly different from that in the band .",
    "such a signature might result from a blend with an eclipsing binary of a different spectral type than the candidate .",
    "even with this extensive battery of tests it may still be difficult or impossible to provide validation for many of the most interesting planet candidates discovered by . for example , blend scenarios involving an eclipsing binary or an eclipsing star - planet pair physically associated with the candidate ( hierarchical triple systems ) and in a long - period orbit around their common center of mass would often be spatially unresolved from the ground .",
    "these configurations may also not be detectable spectroscopically , and would likewise not produce any measurable centroid motion .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to take advantage of all the information available in vetting candidates .    with this as our motivation",
    ", we describe here the use of the light curves themselves in a different way to help discriminate between true planetary transits and a large variety of possible blend scenarios , on a much more quantitative basis than simple back - of - the - envelope calculations could provide .",
    "the technique tests these scenarios by directly modeling the light curves as blends , and has considerable predictive power that allows the expected properties of the various configurations to be tested against other information that may be available .",
    "both hierarchical triples and background blends can be explored .",
    "a restricted application of this type of modeling to  has already been made for the five multi - planet candidates announced recently by @xcite .",
    "for the present paper we have chosen to illustrate the full potential of the method , which we refer to as , by applying it to the unique case of  object of interest 377 ( koi-377 , henceforth kepler-9 ) .",
    "this is a multi - planet system reported and described in detail by @xcite , with _ three _ low - amplitude periodic signals in its light curve .",
    "we have selected this system for two main reasons . on the one hand",
    ", it represents the first unambiguous detection of transit timing variations ( ttvs ) in an extrasolar planet , with a pattern of variation seen in two of its signals ( kepler-9b and kepler-9c ) that constitutes irrefutable evidence that the objects producing them are bona - fide planets .",
    "this offers an ideal opportunity to test  because their true nature is already known . on the other hand ,",
    "the third signal ( koi-377.03 ) is small enough that it would correspond to a super - earth , but validation of its planetary origin is not yet in hand .",
    "should it be validated , kepler-9 would become an even more remarkable laboratory for the study of the architecture of planetary systems involving small planets .",
    "thus , exploring the wide range of possible blend configurations that might mimic this shallow signal is of the greatest interest for determining its true nature",
    ".    is likely to find many other candidate transiting planets similar to koi-377.03 , for which final validation by other means is not currently feasible , either because the expected radial - velocity signal is too small , or because doppler measurements are otherwise complicated due to the star being chromospherically active , rapidly rotating , or too faint . with the application to kepler-9",
    "we show that our light - curve modeling technique is a powerful tool for exploring astrophysical false positive scenarios that is complementary to other diagnostics , and should play an important role in the discovery of earth - size planets around other  targets .",
    "in general the detailed shape of a light curve displaying transit - like events can be expected to contain useful constraints on possible blend scenarios that might be responsible for those signals .",
    "with photometry of the quality of that provided by , those constraints can be quite strong , and may be used to exclude many blend configurations and provide support for the planetary hypothesis .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to take advantage of this information , particularly since it relies only on observations already in hand .",
    "the idea behind  is to compare the transit photometry of a candidate against synthetic light curves produced by an eclipsing binary that is included within the photometric aperture of , and is contaminating the light of the candidate .",
    "the usually deep eclipses of the binary are attenuated by the light of the candidate , and reduced in depth so that they appear transit - like . in principle",
    "there is an enormous range of possible binary configurations that could mimic all of the features of true planetary transits , including not only their depth , but also the total duration and the length of the ingress and egress phases .",
    "generally it is only with detailed modeling that these can be ruled out .",
    "possible scenarios include not only background eclipsing binaries , but also hierarchical triples , i.e. , an eclipsing binary physically associated with the candidate in a wide orbit around their common center of mass .",
    "the basic procedure for simulating light curves with  was described in detail by @xcite , and further changes and enhancements are discussed below .",
    "briefly , the brightness variations of an eclipsing binary are generated with the binary light - curve code ebop @xcite , based on the nelson - davis - etzel model @xcite , and then diluted by the light of the candidate for comparison with the  observations .",
    "effects such as limb darkening , gravity brightening , mutual reflection , and oblateness of the binary components are included .",
    "the objects composing the binary are referred to as the ` secondary ' and ` tertiary ' , and the candidate is the ` primary ' . the properties of each object needed to generate the light curves ( brightness and size ) are taken from model isochrones by @xcite , parametrized in terms of their stellar mass . , which we have extrapolated slightly for this application to 0.10@xmath4 , near the brown dwarf limit ) , and because a convenient web tool provided by the authors allows easy interpolation in both age and metallicity ( http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd ) .",
    "additionally , isochrone magnitudes are available in a variety of passbands including the  and _ spitzer _ passbands , as well as sloan and 2mass.[foot : models ] ] for the primary star the appropriate isochrone is selected by using as constraints the effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity determined spectroscopically .",
    "we assign also a mass and a radius from this isochrone , although these characteristics are irrelevant for generating the model light curves .",
    "we then read off the intrinsic brightness of the star ( absolute magnitude ) in the passband , which is the only property needed by .",
    "the brightness of the primary is held fixed throughout all simulations .",
    "the parameters of the binary components are allowed to vary freely over wide ranges in order to provide the best match to the photometry in a chi - square sense , subject only to the condition that the two stars lie on the same isochrone , as expected from coeval formation .",
    "to read off their properties ( absolute magnitude and size ) we use the mass as an intermediate variable .",
    "the specific isochrone adopted for the binary depends on the configuration : for hierarchical triple scenarios we adopt the same age and chemical composition as the primary , whereas for background binaries the isochrone can be different . the  light curve itself does not provide a useful constraint on the age or metallicity of the binary in the background case , so a typical choice is a model for solar metallicity and a representative age for the field such as 3gyr . for background",
    "binary scenarios the distance between the binary and the main star is parametrized for convenience in terms of the difference in distance modulus , @xmath5 .",
    "the inferred distance between the primary star and the observer will vary from blend to blend because we constrain the combined brightness of all components of the blend to match the measured apparent brightness of the target .",
    "is also able to account for differential extinction between the primary and the binary , which can have a non - negligible effect in some cases given the relatively low galactic latitude of the  field .",
    "early versions of  have been used occasionally in recent years to examine transiting planet candidates from ground - based surveys such as ogle , tres , and hatnet ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as from corot @xcite .",
    "these studies have exploited the predictive power of  to estimate further properties of the blend scenarios , by testing them against complementary information such as color indices , optical / near - infrared spectroscopy , or near - infrared photometry from _",
    "spitzer_. for the application to , several important modifications have been made to , including the following : _",
    "i ) _ the ability to generate light curves integrated over the 29.4-minute effective duration of an observation when using long - cadence data .",
    "this changes the shape of the transits significantly , given the high precision of the  photometry and the relatively short timescales of the events ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; _ ii ) _ de - trending of the original  light curves with a 1-day running median to remove instrumental effects , and rejection of outliers ; _ iii ) _ the use of model isochrones specific to the passband , kindly computed for us by l.  girardi .  can now also use proper limb - darkening coefficients for the same band , as opposed to an approximation to the  passband such as the johnson @xmath6 filter , which is considerably narrower .",
    "limb - darkening coefficients have been computed by @xcite and also a.  prsa ; ] _ iv ) _ extension to any optical or near - infrared passband . in particular , for any scenario explored with , light curves can be computed at other wavelengths such as the 3.6@xmath3 m and 4.5@xmath3 m passbands of the irac instrument on warm _ spitzer _ , in order to further test the blend hypothesis . additionally ,  can predict the overall color of a blend in any pair of passbands , including the effects of differential reddening for background or foreground scenarios .",
    "these colors may then be compared with the measured colors of a target .",
    "extinction at different wavelengths is computed following the prescription by @xcite ; _ v ) _ the ability to have the tertiary be a ( dark ) planet instead of a star , in which case the corresponding free parameter becomes the radius of the planet rather than the tertiary mass .",
    "the mass of the planet has little effect on the light curves in most cases , but can nevertheless be set to any value ; _ vi ) _ the ability to include extra light from other stars that may be present in the  aperture , which further dilutes the intrinsic signatures from the eclipsing binary ; _ vii ) _ the ability to model systems with eccentric orbits .",
    "eccentricity changes the orbital velocities during transit , and can therefore affect the size ( mass ) of stars that allow satisfactory fits to the light curve .",
    "when exploring blend scenarios involving hierarchical triple systems , the free parameters of the problem are the mass of the secondary , the mass of the tertiary ( or its radius , if a planet ) , and the inclination angle .",
    "a fourth variable , the difference in distance modulus , is added for background blends .",
    "these quantities are typically stepped over wide ranges in a grid pattern to fully map the @xmath7 surface . for the application to kepler-9 below ,",
    "stellar masses are allowed to vary along the isochrones between 0.1@xmath4 and 1.4@xmath4 , although at the larger values the observed duration of the transits is already difficult to match unless the events are highly grazing , in which case the shape would be very different . for planetary tertiaries the radii are allowed to be as large as 1.8@xmath8 ; values higher than this have not been observed .",
    "kepler-9 ( kic3323887 , 2mass19021775 + 3824032 ) is a relatively faint star compared to typical ground - based transit hosts ( magnitude @xmath9 ) , which was observed by the mission beginning in the first quarter of operations , and presents three distinct periodic signals in its light curve .",
    "the two with the largest amplitudes have periods of 19.24 days ( kepler-9b ) and 38.91 days ( kepler-9c ) , and brightness decrements of 6.5 and 6.0 mmag , respectively .",
    "the third signal ( koi-377.03 ) is much shallower ( 0.2 mmag ) , and repeats every 1.59 days .",
    "the two longer periods are within 2.5% of being in a 2:1 ratio , and both objects display obvious ttvs that are anti - correlated , clearly indicating they are interacting gravitationally and therefore orbit the same star , and are planetary in nature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the estimated radii are quite similar to that of saturn , and the masses are somewhat smaller than saturn , based on available radial - velocity measurements constrained by transit times and durations .",
    "the short - period signal has one of the smallest amplitudes detected by , and may well correspond to a third , super - earth - size planet in the system , with an estimated radius of only @xmath11.5@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , because it shows no ttvs related to the other two planets ( nor is expected to , on dynamical grounds ) , and is predicted to induce only a very small reflex velocity on the parent star that may be below detection for such a faint object , the true origin of this signal has not yet been established .    in the absence of the crucial evidence of ttvs ,",
    "each of the two largest signals and indeed the third signal as well could in principle be due to a different blend .",
    "therefore , as an illustration of the application of , we model the light curve of kepler-9 at each period separately , as we would any candidate with a single period , and we account for possible blends at the other periods by incorporating extra dilution consistent with those other scenarios .",
    "the goal for the two largest signals is to demonstrate , as a sanity check , that  would be able to rule out blends in similar cases where confirmation is lacking , which  is expected to find in significant numbers . for the third signal of unknown nature",
    ", the application of  should provide valuable evidence one way or the other .",
    "kepler-9 is a solar type star .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of the primary are adopted from @xcite : @xmath11k , @xmath12 , and [ fe / h ] @xmath13 . with these parameters ,",
    "a comparison with the stellar evolution models of @xcite yields a stellar mass of @xmath14 , a radius of @xmath15 , and an age of about 1gyr , along with the absolute magnitude in the  band . only the latter is used by , and is held fixed in our modeling .",
    "the distance to the star estimated from the same models is about 650pc , ignoring extinction .",
    "uncertainties in the brightness of the primary stemming from errors in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and [ fe / h ] are small .",
    "for example , the error in @xmath18 , which has the most direct influence on the intrinsic brightness , translates to an uncertainty of little more than 0.1mag in the absolute magnitude .",
    "this has an insignificant impact on our results .",
    "the photometry used here consists of the long - cadence measurements gathered for kepler-9 during  quarters  1 , 2 , and 3 , spanning 218 days , and was treated slightly differently than indicated earlier for a generic  candidate because of the complications stemming from the ttvs . using the binary fits tables from mast ( multimission archive at stsci , http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/ ) ,",
    "the `` raw '' aperture photometry for each quarter was first de - trended using a moving cubic polynomial fit robustly to out - of - transit data , with a sliding window of 999 minutes before and after each individual datapoint .",
    "this technique removes long - term trends due to stellar activity or instrumental errors , but retains the properties of each transit light curve .",
    "statistically significant outliers were removed .",
    "for the two long - period signals , simple folding will not create an accurate light curve because of the strong ttvs .",
    "instead , we used a `` shift - and - stack '' technique , in which each transit event is displaced so that it is centered at `` time '' zero using the measured transit times from @xcite .",
    "along with the measurements in transit , nearly a full cycle of out - of - transit data were also shifted .",
    "specifically , we shifted nearly 25% of an orbital cycle before the transit , and nearly 75% after the transit .",
    "this preserves any curvature outside of eclipse , and in principle would also reproduce any secondary eclipses , both of which can provide useful constraints when modeling the light curve with .",
    "we note , however , that the strong ttvs of the transits would be accompanied by shifted secondary eclipses in a way that can only be predicted by full numerical integration .",
    "this shift - and - stack technique would not align secondary eclipses correctly and thus their depth would need to be significant in each individual event to be noticed . there is no sign of secondary eclipses at these periods in the data at the @xmath19 level , as expected from the planetary nature of the objects , and thus the failure of the shift - and - stack technique to correctly add up the secondary eclipses does not affect our results .",
    "after shifting , all the transit and out - of - transit data were `` stacked '' together and each data point was given a time relative to time zero at the center of each transit event .",
    "this was done separately for the 19-day and 39-day signals .",
    "we have been careful not to use a full cycle of out - of - transit data to avoid using any photometric measurements more than once in the input light curve .    for the 1.6-day signal that repeats at regular intervals ( since it shows no ttvs )",
    ", we created a light curve by simply masking out the transits at the other two periods .",
    "the photometric aperture of  is typically a few pixels across , with a scale of 398 per pixel ( see below ) .",
    "high - resolution imaging of kepler-9 was performed in order to identify neighboring stars that might be eclipsing binaries blended with and contaminating the target photometry .",
    "images were recorded with the guider camera of the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck  i telescope on mauna kea , in unfiltered light .",
    "the nominal sensitivity of the ccd from 400 to 800 nm yields an effective passband similar to the  passband .",
    "the field of view was 43@xmath2057 , and the pixel scale was 030 per pixel .",
    "one of these frames appears in figure  [ fig : guider ] , and shows at least four stars in the field of view within 15  of the target .",
    "some of these stars are listed in various astrometric and photometric catalogs .",
    "the brightness of these companions relative to the target was measured using aperture photometry on four separate keck images , and ranges from @xmath21 to 5.9 mag .",
    "0.1 in    speckle observations of kepler-9 were carried out on 2010 june 18 with the wiyn 3.5 m telescope located on kitt peak .",
    "they were taken with a two - color emccd speckle camera using narrow - band filters 40 nm wide centered at 562 nm and 692 nm .",
    "we refer loosely to these passbands as @xmath22 and @xmath6 .",
    "the native seeing was 07 .",
    "no companions with @xmath23 mag ( @xmath6 band ) are present in the field of view centered on the target out to 18 , at the 5-@xmath24 confidence level . inside of 02",

    "the centroid measurements described below use data from quarter  3 only . in quarter  1",
    "the kepler-9 aperture was determined to be too small to optimally capture its flux , and was subsequently enlarged . in quarter  2  experienced undesirable pointing drift , which was later resolved .",
    "these problems complicate the centroid analysis for quarters  1 and 2 , although the results are broadly consistent with the more reliable ones from quarter  3 presented here .",
    "we describe first the use of difference image analysis to demonstrate that the transit sources for all three kepler-9 planets and candidates are restricted to being very near the target star .",
    "a difference image is formed by averaging several exposures near , but outside of a transit and subtracting from this the average of all available exposures near transit center .",
    "this results in a typically isolated signal , a positive intensity with the shape of the point spread function ( psf ) at the _ true spatial location _ of the transit source , and an amplitude equal to the photometric transit depth times the direct image intensity for the target . adopting 40 independent transits of koi-377.03 in quarter  3 ( avoiding those shortly after major disturbances such as a safing event , and avoiding any that overlap with ` b ' and ` c ' transits ) ,",
    "each formed with six symmetrically placed exposures outside of transits ( after a two exposure gap ) and three near transit minimum , results in a 14-@xmath24 signal in the difference image .",

    "kepler-9c used two transits with seven exposures in - transit , a gap of three , and seven symmetrically placed out - of - transit exposure blocks . by using only exposures pulled close in time , and symmetrically with respect to the transits in use to form a difference image , this effectively imposes a de - trending and avoids any complications from drifts on time scales longer than the average spread of the out - of - transit sets , which for kepler-9c ( the widest ) is about 9 hours .",
    "inspection of the difference images in figure  [ fig : differenceimages ] shows that the transit sources for the confirmed ` b ' and ` c ' planets @xcite and the candidate koi-377.03 must arise from close to the target star , with offsets approaching one pixel easily ruled out by inspection . a weighted psf fit ( or more properly , a pixel response function ( prf ) fit ; see * ? ? ?",

    "this exaggeration of the centroid offset has been traced to inaccuracies in the kic used to create the model images .",
    "therefore , the centroid shifts in table  [ tab : modeled_offsets ] should be scaled by a factor 1/3.7 .",
    "if the transit were on one of the companion stars in the aperture , then the modeled centroid shift would be an order of magnitude larger than observed for kepler-9b and kepler-9c , ruling out the companion stars as the source for these signals .",

    ", we modeled the light curves for each of these two signals assuming they are the result of an eclipsing binary physically associated with the target , i.e. , at the same distance ( hierarchical triple ) .",
    "for this case the isochrone for the binary was taken to be the same as that of the primary , and corresponds to [ fe / h ] = + 0.12 and an age of 1  gyr .",
    "the secondary and tertiary masses were allowed to vary freely between 0.10@xmath4 ( the lower limit in the models ; see footnote  [ foot : models ] ) and 1.40@xmath4 , as mentioned earlier , seeking the best fit to the photometry .",
    "the inclination angle was also free , and the orbits were assumed to be circular . in both kepler-9b and c , which have similar transit signals , we find that the best fitting hierarchical triple blend model corresponds to secondaries that are approximately 1.0 and 0.5 mag fainter than the primary , respectively , and tertiaries that are at the lower limit of the isochrone range ( late m dwarfs ) .",
    "however these fits give a poor match to the photometry :  is unable to simultaneously reproduce the total duration of the transit and the central depth , given the constraints on the brightness and size of the stars from the isochrones .",
    "this type of blend scenario is therefore clearly ruled out .",
    "we illustrate this for kepler-9b in figure  [ fig : koi377b_ht ] , where the best - fit planet model is also shown for reference .",
    "much better matches to the data can be found if additional light from a fourth star along the line of sight is incorporated into the model , providing extra dilution .",
    "we find that this fourth star is required to be nearly as bright as the primary , and the optimal model changes in such a way that the secondary also becomes as bright as the primary ( so that its size enables the duration of the transits to be reproduced ) , while the tertiary remains a small star .",
    "this rather contrived scenario requiring two bright stars that are nearly identical to the main star would be easily recognized in our high - resolution imaging for separations larger than about 01 ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : aosensitivity ] ) , in our centroid analysis for separations larger than 006 , or would otherwise produce obvious spectroscopic signatures unless all three bright objects happened to have the same radial velocity .",
    "we next considered blends involving eclipsing binaries in the background , by removing the constraint on the distance . in this case",
    "a solar - metallicity isochrone was adopted for the binary , with a representative age for the field of 3gyr .",
    "we explored a wide range of relative distances , and we first considered main - sequence stars only , again with circular binary orbits .",
    "the results for kepler-9b and c are once again similar to each other , and we illustrate them for kepler-9c in figure  [ fig : koi377c_backstar ] .",
    "the axes correspond to the distance modulus difference @xmath5 as a function of the tertiary mass .",
    "contours represent constant differences in the @xmath7 of the fit compared to the best - fit planet model , and are labeled in units of the statistical significance of the difference ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we draw two main results from this figure .",
    "one is that the light curve fits strongly prefer the smallest available tertiary masses from the isochrones ( 0.10@xmath4 ) , and would in fact yield better fits for even smaller tertiaries ( i.e. , planets ) .",
    "additionally , the best solutions cluster toward equal distances for the binary and the primary star , effectively converging toward the equivalent of the hierarchical triple scenario considered earlier .",
    "no acceptable solutions exist with the binary at a significant distance behind the primary star .",
    "the best fit to the light curve of kepler-9c is similar to the one shown in figure  [ fig : koi377b_ht ] ( dashed curve ) , which is not particularly good .",
    "the @xmath5 vs.tertiary mass diagram for kepler-9b is qualitatively the same . allowing the secondary to be a giant star gives a very poor fit to the photometry : the duration of the transit is very much longer than observed , there is out - of - eclipse modulation due to distortions in the giant , and all solutions place the binary at an implausibly large distance .",
    "we conclude that blend configurations involving background eclipsing binaries in which the tertiary is a star are not a viable explanation for either of these two signals .",
    "we then explored background eclipsing binaries in which the tertiaries are planets rather than stars .",
    "this allows their radii to be smaller , possibly providing a better fit to the  photometry .",
    "the orbits were considered to be circular , as before .",
    "figure  [ fig : koi377c_backplanet ] shows the results for kepler-9c , this time in the plane of separation versus secondary mass .",
    "once again the fits tends to favor an equal distance for the binary and the primary star , and background scenarios with the binary far behind provide unacceptably poor matches to the light curve .",
    "a second noteworthy result is that these solutions have a strong preference for secondary stars that are quite similar to the primary .",
    "all acceptable fits to the light curve correspond to relatively bright secondaries with @xmath77 mag ( see figure  [ fig : koi377c_backplanet ] ) .",
    "the best of these solutions is of about the same quality as a planet model , and has a secondary of mass 0.98@xmath4 that is only 100k cooler and 0.3 mag fainter than the primary in the  band .",
    "this somewhat artificial case of `` twin '' stars is a result we have seen often in simulations for other  candidates .",
    "the tertiary in this type of blend solution comes out about @xmath78 larger than in a planet model because the transit is diluted by another star of approximately equal size and brightness .",
    "one may debate whether this situation should actually be referred to as a `` false positive '' for kepler-9 , since the signal would still correspond to a gas giant planet , only that this planet would be @xmath78 larger , and it would be orbiting a different star . alternatively , it could be thought of simply as an overlooked dilution factor in a true planetary system . in any event ,",
    "the lack of evidence for this bright twin star in the spectroscopy or in our high - resolution imaging or centroid analysis for kepler-9 does not support this scenario .    as a particular case of this family of configurations",
    ", we examined blends in which the star - planet pair is constrained to be at the same distance as the primary , i.e. , effectively in a hierarchical system .",
    "the secondary properties were therefore taken from the same isochrone as the primary , and the orbits were assumed to be circular .",
    "an excellent fit to the light curve is possible for a tertiary that is about @xmath78 larger than in a true planet model , but not surprisingly , we find once more that the secondary must be as bright as the primary .",
    "additional tests were run to examine the impact of changing the age adopted for the isochrone of the secondary in a background star - planet pair , or the addition of light from a fourth object in the aperture . in the first case ,",
    "changing the age from 3gyr to 1gyr produced a small shift of the contours in figure  [ fig : koi377c_backplanet ] downward and to the right that is simply due to the change in intrinsic brightness of the secondary star , and does not alter our conclusions . adding `` fourth light '' further attenuates the eclipses of the star - planet pair . to compensate ,  requires a slightly deeper eclipse , and in order to preserve the shape of the signal ( total duration , and slope of ingress / egress ) , this is achieved by bringing the secondary closer to the primary .",
    "as a result , for relatively bright fourth light the contours are shifted downward by approximately the difference in magnitude between the primary and the fourth star , again without changing the conclusions .",
    "one may also imagine blend scenarios in which the eclipsing binary is in the foreground , rather than the background .",
    "we explored this possibility by extending the simulations to negative values of @xmath5 .",
    "as before , we adopted circular orbits and a 3gyr isochrone for the foreground system .",
    "binaries with stellar tertiaries are clearly ruled out as they yield fits to the light curve that do not match its shape , and additionally they predict a fairly obvious secondary eclipse that is not seen in the data .",
    "we focus therefore on blends in which the tertiary is a planet , and we illustrate the results for kepler-9c . in this case",
    "we find there are many acceptable solutions with @xmath7 values differing from the best planet fit at the level of 1@xmath24 or less .",
    "these solutions span a range of secondary masses and a range of foreground separations , implying a wide range not only in apparent brightness for the secondary , but also in color .",
    "models in which the secondaries are brighter than the primary and of significantly different spectral type would be inconsistent with the spectroscopic parameters derived for kepler-9 , and are excluded .",
    "plausible solutions remain , in principle , for fainter foreground secondaries , which necessarily involve later - type stars .",
    "we find that of these , the only ones that yield acceptably good fits to the  photometry , with @xmath7 values differing from the planet fit by less than 3@xmath24 , correspond to secondaries that are within about 1.5 mag of the the primary in brightness , and are of course redder",
    ". these would be valid blend configurations so long as the secondaries are close enough to the primary to be spatially unresolved ( angular separations @xmath79 ) , and at the same time faint enough to have gone undetected in the spectra .",
    "stars that are within @xmath122.5 mag of the primary would generally have been seen spectroscopically , as indicated in sect .",
    "[ sec : observations ] , and this would exclude these remaining foreground blend configurations . nevertheless , to be conservative , let us assume for the moment that a star 1.5 mag fainter than the primary has still managed to elude detection in our spectra .",
    "this corresponds to the faintest secondary in a foreground blend scenario that still allows for a satisfactory fit to the light curve , and would be the most difficult case of this kind to disprove .",
    "this fit is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : colors ] , and is statistically indistinguishable from a planet model fit .",
    "the secondary in this configuration is an m2 dwarf ( @xmath80@xmath4 ) 1.53 mag fainter than the primary , eclipsed by a 0.91@xmath8 planetary companion , and is located at a distance of 300 pc .",
    "the primary in this scenario is at 750 pc .",
    "other properties of this particular blend such as magnitudes and colors can be computed easily with , and compared with observations .",
    "apparent magnitudes for kepler-9 are available from the kic for a variety of passbands including sloan @xmath81 , a special - purpose passband referred to as d51 ( centered on the b triplet at 518.7 nm ) , and @xmath82 from the 2mass catalog .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : colors ] shows various color indices ( @xmath83 ) predicted by  both for the primary star alone and for the blend .",
    "those of the primary are well reproduced by the model , and we find that a small amount of interstellar extinction leads to an even better match ( solid line in the figure ) .",
    "the colors of the blend , on the other hand , disagree with the measured colors , and deviate by more than 0.4 mag for the reddest index , @xmath84 .",
    "we are therefore able to exclude , solely on the basis of its color , this most difficult of the scenarios involving foreground star - planet pairs that could mimic the 19-day and 39-day signals in the light curve of kepler-9 .",
    "larger - mass secondaries would not be as red and still allow for good fits to the photometry , but they are intrinsically brighter and would be recognized more easily .",
    "the above simulations have all assumed circular orbits for the blended eclipsing binaries or star - planet pairs , which is not necessarily realistic given the relatively long periods of kepler-9b and c. eccentricity affects the speed of the secondary and tertiary in their relative orbit , and therefore can change the duration of the transit , making it shorter or longer than in a circular orbit , depending on the orientation ( longitude of periastron , @xmath85 ) .",
    "it also changes the impact parameter , all else being equal . and finally , it shifts the location of the secondary eclipse . the magnitude of these effects is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ecc ] for eccentricities between 0.1 and 0.7 .",
    "the most important effect for our purposes is on the transit duration . given a fixed ( measured ) duration , eccentric orbits may allow blends with smaller or larger secondary stars than in the circular case to still provide satisfactory fits to the light curve , effectively increasing the pool of potential false positives .",
    "the limiting cases correspond to @xmath86 and 270 , in which the line of apsides is aligned with the line of sight and the transit occurs at periastron ( accommodating larger secondaries ) or apastron ( smaller secondaries ) , respectively .",
    "extensive simulations for these two extreme situations show that allowing for eccentric orbits does not change our conclusions regarding hierarchical triple systems , background eclipsing binaries , or background star - planet scenarios .",
    "we show this for the latter blend category in figure  [ fig : backplanet_ecc ] , illustrated for the case of orbits with eccentricities of 0.3 and 0.5 , and @xmath86 .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig : koi377c_backplanet ] indicates that in both cases the blends are still bright enough that we would have seen signatures of them in the spectra of kepler-9 .",
    "larger eccentricities of @xmath87 result in secondaries that are brighter still . for eccentric orbits oriented such that transits take place at apastron ( @xmath88 ) , we only find acceptable fits to the light curves for eclipsing star - planet pairs that are in the foreground ( and involve smaller stars ) .",

    "this type of configuration was ruled out earlier based on the high - resolution imaging and the spectroscopy .",
    "small tertiaries with appreciable mass , such as white dwarfs , induce tidal distortions on the primary due to the short orbital period that lead to significant out - of - eclipse variations in the light curve ( ellipsoidal variability ) .",

    "acceptable fits with @xmath7 differing from the planet model by less than 3@xmath24 are possible over a wide range of relative separations ( @xmath91 ) , but the secondaries are restricted to a relatively narrow interval in mass centered on the mass of the primary .",
    "these eclipsing binaries are all very distant and faint ( @xmath9222 ) , and have no effect on the colors of the blend .",

    "the secondary in this model is a late g star 5.5mag fainter than the primary in the passband , eclipsed by a late m dwarf that produces no detectable secondary eclipse .",
    "the predicted brightness of this binary precisely matches that of the closest companion identified in the ao images ( comp 1 , table  [ tab : companions ] ) , located 285 ne of the target .",
    "however , this and all wider visual companions are already ruled out at more than the 3-@xmath24 confidence level by the lack of centroid motion , which would have revealed any blended eclipsing binaries at angular separations larger than about 074 ( sect.[sec : centroids ] ) . even without this constraint from astrometry ,",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : k3backstarextin ] , and indicate that the blend scenarios providing good fits to the  photometry of koi-377.03 are systematically shifted to smaller distances compared to the previous calculations .",
    "their apparent brightness , however , changes relatively little , as can be seen by comparing the lines of equal @xmath95 with those in figure  [ fig : k3backstar ] .",

    "the high - resolution images rule out all blends that are brighter than the sensitivity limit indicated in figure  [ fig : aosensitivity ] ( i.e. , those that fall above the curves ) .    as expected from the fixed duration and depth of the transit - like signal of koi-377.03 ,",
    "the size of the tertiary in these configurations correlates with the secondary mass . due to this correlation",
    ", small tertiaries with @xmath100 ( roughly neptune - size , and smaller ) are further excluded because the eclipses they produce are already very shallow , and further dilution by the primary would make them too shallow to fit the photometry . in order to avoid this",
    ", the secondaries in those blends must be relatively small late - g type stars that are nearby , and would therefore be bright enough ( @xmath101 ) that they would have been detected in our spectra as a second set of lines .",
    "thus ,  effectively places limits not only on the secondary , but also on the size of the tertiary ( see figure  [ fig : k3backplanr3 ] ) . in particular , blends with a white dwarf eclipsing a background star are also ruled out for the same reason described above .",
    "additionally , the predicted light curves for such cases with white dwarf tertiaries show ellipsoidal variability , which is not observed.30 , which should still allow that star to be seen spectroscopically if it were bright enough . in any case ,",
    "white dwarfs are excluded as viable tertiaries for the reasons mentioned in the text . ]",
    "many of the larger tertiaries correspond to gas giants ( saturn - size , or larger ) , which implies a qualitative difference in their nature compared to the alternate model of a true earth- or super - earth - size planet . in this sense these blends may properly be considered `` false positives '' , as opposed to the configurations discussed earlier requiring twin stars , which only change the tertiary radius by @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we examine the possibility that the true period of the koi-377.03 signal is twice the nominal value .",
    "alternating events would then correspond to the primary and secondary eclipses of a blended eclipsing binary ( the tertiary being a star in this case ) , which may in general be of different depth . in koi-377.03 there is no compelling evidence for a depth difference between odd- and even - numbered events , but this is difficult to establish in a faint star such as this for a signal that is only 0.2mmag deep .",
    "the results of extensive simulations with  for this scenario are illustrated in figure  [ fig : k3backstar2p ] .",
    "the best fits correspond to blended binaries far in the background , and do not indicate a significant difference in depth between the primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "however , these fits provide only a poor representation of the light curve , and can therefore be confidently ruled out .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ fig:2p ] .",
    "the top panel shows the closest fit to the full light curve together with the data , and in the bottom panel we have binned the measurements to facilitate the comparison .",
    "this solution involves an eclipsing pair of mid - g dwarfs at 21kpc and 7.2 mag fainter than the primary , and the fit is visibly worse than that corresponding to a planet at half the period , which is shown with the dashed line .",
    "in summary , the  analysis of this section coupled with constraints from spectroscopy , high - resolution imaging , and centroid motion measurements rules out a large fraction of the false positives that could produce the 1.59-day signal , but not all ( see table  [ tab : sumsmall ] ) .",
    "the remaining configurations involve main - sequence background stars that are similar to the primary in spectral type ( late f to early k , or about 0.9@xmath4 to about 1.2@xmath4 ) , and are eclipsed either by another main - sequence smaller star or by a planet with @xmath102 ( neptune - size or larger ) .",
    "these blends range in apparent brightness from @xmath103 to @xmath104 for stellar tertiaries , and from @xmath105 to @xmath97 if the tertiaries are planets , and must be closer than 074 from the target . at separations under 074",

    "we describe here the calculation of the likelihood that the signal is due to a background blend involving either a stellar tertiary or a planetary tertiary , taking into account the constraints on brightness and other properties indicated in the previous section . because this type of calculation is likely to be relevant for other  candidates ,",

    "the frequency of stars in the mass range permitted by  was estimated using the besanon galactic structure models of @xcite , specifically for the @xmath6 band , which is the closest available to the  passband .",
    "we used an aperture of 1 square degree centered on kepler-9 , and we performed the stellar density calculations in half - magnitude bins of apparent brightness , accounting for interstellar extinction as we did in the  simulations , with a coefficient of 0.5  mag  kpc@xmath33 in @xmath22 .",
    "the range of allowed secondary masses for each magnitude bin was taken directly from figure  [ fig : k3backstarextin ] for blends with stellar tertiaries , and from figure  [ fig : k3backplan ] for blends with planetary tertiaries .    using the density of stars in each magnitude bin , we calculated the fraction that would remain undetected after our high - resolution imaging ( speckle and ao observations ) , spectroscopy , and centroid motion analyses .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : statistics ] .",

    "planetary tertiaries are listed separately . for the stellar tertiary case ,",
    "column  3 reports the density of stars obtained from the besanon models , restricted to the mass range allowed by  as shown in figure  [ fig : k3backstarextin ] .",
    "column  4 lists the maximum angular separation @xmath108 at which stars in the corresponding magnitude bin would go undetected in our imaging observations , read off from figure  [ fig : aosensitivity ] , and taken at the center of each magnitude bin .",
    "centroid motion analysis rules out eclipsing binaries beyond 074 , so @xmath108 is constant at that value for the last few bins in which this provides a stronger constraint than the imaging limits . the total number of stars of the appropriate mass range in a circle of radius @xmath108 around kepler-9 is then given for each bin in column  5 , in units of @xmath109 .",
    "we note that the secondary mass and angular separation constraints together reduce the number of background stars to be considered as potential contaminants by a factor of @xmath110 compared to the number that would otherwise be expected to fall within the photometric aperture of .",
    "this is already indicative of a significantly reduced chance of having a false positive .",
    "the intrinsic frequency of eclipsing binaries in the field is a key ingredient in the calculation , and for this we have relied on the results of @xcite , which are based on the observations themselves .",
    "these authors found the average occurrence rate of eclipsing binaries among the  targets down to @xmath111 to be approximately 1.2% across the entire field .",
    "this may be a slight overestimate because it counts as eclipsing binaries targets that are actually blended with a background binary that is not a target , though the effect is likely small .",
    "there is little information available on fainter eclipsing binaries , so we assume here that a similar frequency holds .",
    "more importantly , many of these eclipsing binaries can not produce signals such as that of koi-377.03 because their light curves have the wrong shape .",
    "examples include contact binaries and ellipsoidal variables , in which the brightness changes continuously throughout the cycle , rather than presenting sharp transit - like events such as we observe .",
    "additionally , semi - detached systems would have eclipses that are too long and also of the wrong shape .",
    "we therefore exclude these from the tally . with this adjustment ,",
    "the frequency of eclipsing binaries capable of producing blends is 0.53% . multiplying the star counts in column  5 by this frequency",
    ", we obtain the total number of blends expected in each magnitude bin , which is reported in column  6 .",
    "columns  79 are similar to columns  35 , but for blends involving star - planet pairs .",
    "note that the range of allowed magnitudes is different in this case , as is the range of secondary masses used to compute the densities in column  7 ( see figure  [ fig : k3backplan ] ) . following the size ranges adopted by @xcite , we consider three categories of transiting planets as potential companions : super - earths ( 1.252@xmath10 ) , neptune - size planets ( 26  @xmath10 ) , and jupiter - size planets ( 622 @xmath10 , or equivalently @xmath10.52.0 @xmath8 ) .",
    "planetary tertiaries smaller than 0.3@xmath112 are ruled out by , as false positives with such tertiaries can only reproduce the light curve if the secondaries are relatively bright , and those would have been detected spectroscopically .",
    "this effectively eliminates all super - earths , and a fraction of the neptunes . for the intrinsic frequency of transiting planets we have relied on the results from the first 43 days of  observations as reported by @xcite . that census is unlikely to have missed many neptune- or jupiter - size planets ( except ones with very long periods ) , although it may include false positives ,",
    "so we consider the count to be conservative .",
    "those authors presented a list of 306 targets with at least one transiting planet candidate , and described another 400 targets with one or more transit - like signals that have not yet been released .",
    "of the 306 targets , 24% would correspond to jupiter - size planets , and 23% to neptune - size planets .",
    "one may reasonably assume that the 400 sequestered targets contain a larger fraction of smaller earth- or super - earth - size planets ( which can not mimic the light curve of koi-377.03 ; see sect .",
    "[ sec : koi377.03 ] ) , for at least two reasons .",
    "smaller planets are the main focus of the  mission , and they require more intensive follow - up efforts for validation , which is why those targets have not yet been made public . secondly , these 400 targets are brighter , which makes smaller planets around them easier to detect . consequently , the assumption of similar jupiter- and neptune - size planet frequencies as given above , but for the entire sample of @xmath113 targets showing transit - like features , is a conservative one . scaling to the full sample of @xmath114  targets @xcite , we find an upper limit to the frequency of transiting jupiter - size and neptune - size planets of 0.11% and 0.10% , respectively . with these adopted frequencies , the resulting numbers of blends involving these types of planets are listed in columns  10 and 11 of table  [ tab : statistics ] .",
    "the total blend frequencies in each of columns  6 , 10 , and 11 are calculated as the sum of the individual frequencies in each magnitude bin , and the three columns are then combined in the bottom section of the table to yield an overall blend frequency ( bf ) of @xmath115 .",
    "this very small figure corresponds to the number of false positives we expect to find a priori for kepler-9 .",
    "however , we point out that this _ does not _ translate directly into a false alarm probability , or equivalently into a confidence level that the candidate is orbited by a true super - earth - size planet , as that requires knowledge of the rate of occurrence of such planets . for a random candidate star in the field the rate of false positives relative to the rate of true planets ( false alarm rate , far )",
    "can be written quite generally as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the number of false positives and @xmath118 is the number of planets in the sample .",
    "thus , the larger the number of planets we expect , the smaller the far .",
    "we consider kepler-9 to be fairly representative of a typical target in the field in terms of its spectral type ( solar ) , brightness , and background stellar density ( a function of galactic latitude ) . in that case",
    ", the total number of blends can be taken to be approximately the product of bf and the size of the sample , or @xmath119 .",
    "the number of small planets expected in the sample is of course not known , and determining it is precisely one of the goals of the  mission .",
    "if we accept a confidence level of 99.73% ( 3@xmath24 ) as being sufficient for validation of a transiting planet candidate ( corresponding to @xmath120 ) , then the minimum number of super - earth - size planets @xmath118 required in order to be able to claim this level of confidence is six .",
    "even though @xmath118 is unknown , it is possible to make educated guesses as to what the _ minimum _ value would be in several ways , drawing on both theoretical and observational considerations .",
    "ground - based doppler surveys continue to push toward the detection of smaller and smaller planetary signals .",
    "@xcite have reported preliminary results from a sample of some 400 fgk stars observed with the harps instrument on the eso 3.6 m telescope ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that as many as @xmath130% of the targets may be orbited by close - in super - earth- and neptune - mass companions ( 530@xmath121 ) with periods up to 50 days .",
    "the peak in the period distribution seems to be around 10 days . by making use of the corotlux tool @xcite we simulated a sample of @xmath114 stars in the  field based on the besanon models employed earlier , and used the results from @xcite to assign planets at random to each star , with a log - normal distribution of periods centered at 10 days .",
    "approximate planetary radii were inferred from the masses using the structure models of @xcite , by drawing masses at random and assigning radii over the full range of compositions allowed by these models .",
    "we then retained only those in the super - earth category , with @xmath122 .",
    "the number of these planets that undergo transits in the  field is calculated to be @xmath123 .",
    "if we were to accept this estimate , the corresponding false alarm rate would be @xmath124 .",
    "a similar doppler survey of 166 g and k stars with the hires instrument on the 10-m keck  i telescope @xcite has provided additional insights into the rate of occurrence of small - mass planets .",
    "the results suggest that approximately 18% of solar - type stars harbor planets in the range of 3 to 30@xmath121 with periods under 50 days .",
    "a calculation analogous to that carried out above for the transit probabilities and conversion from planetary masses to planetary radii leads to an estimate of @xmath125 for the  field .",
    "if we adopted this lower estimate , the corresponding false alarm rate would be @xmath126 .",
    "population synthesis studies such as those of @xcite and @xcite based on the formation of planets by the core accretion process and subsequent migration have provided tentative predictions of the properties of planets , including distributions of their masses , periods , and other characteristics .",
    "these theoretical models seem to point to a sizable population of super - earths that may be several times larger than the number of neptune- or jupiter - mass planets in those simulations . scaled to the size of the sample",
    ", this would imply there could be several hundred small transiting planets .",
    "however , the authors caution that those results should be considered with great care as some of the physical ingredients in these models are still very uncertain .",
    "a further estimate may be obtained from the preliminary results as reported by @xcite . among the 306 targets listed there showing one or more periodic transit - like signals , 27 fall in the category of super - earths . while it is true that these candidates have not yet been followed up and validated , and may therefore include some fraction of false positives , additional super - earth - size planets are to be expected in the list of 400 unreleased candidates , which could make @xmath118 considerably larger .",
    "this is particularly true since the targets in the latter list are all brighter than those in the publicly available set , and therefore the proportion of small planets is likely to be higher because the transit events are easier to detect . nevertheless ,",
    "if we were to accept that @xmath118 is as small as 27 , then the corresponding false alarm rate would be @xmath127 .",
    "there are caveats associated with each of the observational estimates mentioned above that should be kept in mind .",
    "the  results invoked in the previous paragraph are still preliminary , and although we regard our use of them to be conservative for the reasons described earlier , the true fraction of false positives in the  sample remains unknown until all candidates have been followed up .",
    "the doppler results are also preliminary to some degree , and are based on somewhat limited samples of stars . it is also possible that a fraction of those doppler candidates may turn out to be false positives , or given the @xmath128 ambiguity inherent in that technique , that some of them may have actual masses above the range considered for super - earths . additionally , there are uncertainties associated with the conversion we have applied between planetary masses and planetary radii , using theoretical models .",
    "those uncertainties are difficult to quantify given our present state of knowledge .    for these reasons , added to the fact that despite our best efforts to assess the blend frequency there could still be some exotic blend scenario that we have overlooked , it is not possible to present a more definitive value of the false alarm rate . nevertheless , the above estimates of the far based on consideration of all the blend scenarios that seem plausible to us",
    "are all sufficiently small that they give us very high confidence that koi-377.03 is not a false positive , and they therefore validate it as a signal of planetary origin .",
    "we designate this planet kepler-9d .",
    "calculating the false alarm rate for targets with small signals such as kepler-9d is non - trivial because it depends crucially on the frequency of small transiting planets , which may only be fully known at the conclusion of the  mission . of the arguments for the expected value of @xmath118 presented in the previous section ,",
    "the one that relies on the preliminary  results themselves is the most conservative , and already makes it highly unlikely that we are in the presence of a false positive such as those explored in this paper .",
    "furthermore , that estimate is based on results from only the first @xmath143 days of operation of the spacecraft",
    ". continued observations over the next two years will surely increase the number of candidates , which can only result in a larger confidence that the 1.6-day photometric signal is due to a true planet .",
    "thus , we find the overall evidence for the planet interpretation very compelling .",
    "it is also worth noting that the doppler surveys have found that a very large fraction of the smallest - mass planetary companions ( as many as 80% ) are in multi - planet systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the presence of kepler-9b and c , this makes it considerably more likely that kepler-9d is also a planet than if it were the only signal in the system .",
    "furthermore , one may expect a priori that a planet interior to kepler-9b and c would have a high probability of presenting transits . indeed , with the reasonable assumption that the orbit of the inner planet is more or less coplanar with the outer two , the geometric probability of a transit at a period of 1.6 days would be close to 100% , instead of @xmath118% for random inclinations .",
    "the light - curve parameters we obtain for kepler-9d by modeling the photometry using the formalism of @xcite are summarized in table  [ tab : kepler9d ] , and supersede the preliminary estimates of @xcite .",
    "the values and uncertainties were determined using a markov chain monte carlo technique , with four chains of length @xmath109 each .",
    "our fits used the non - linear fourth - order limb - darkening law of @xcite , with coefficients for the  band taken from the calculations by a.  prsa referenced in footnote  [ foot : prsa ] . for an adopted stellar radius for the primary star of @xmath15 , the estimated size of this planet",
    "is @xmath129 , which is among the smallest yet reported.@xmath10 according to @xcite , and was revised to @xmath130 by @xcite .",
    "the measured radius of the next smallest known planet , gj1214b , is @xmath131@xmath10 @xcite . ]",
    "the uncertainly is currently dominated by the photometric errors , rather than the stellar parameters , and should improve as more measurements are gathered .",
    "the impact parameter of kepler-9d is very poorly constrained by current data , but should also become better determined in the future . a mass determination for this object has not been made , and will be challenging given the small amplitude expected for the reflex motion of the star",
    ". the radial - velocity semi - amplitude would be only about 2.3 m  s@xmath33 assuming a similar mean density as the earth .",
    "velocity measurements are further complicated by the presence of the other two planets in this system .",

    "other reasons may also hinder this type of validation , such as rapid rotation , chromospheric activity , or even the faintness of the star .",
    "the information contained in the  light curves on the shape of a transit - like event is a valuable asset for constraining the vast range of possible astrophysical false positives that might be masquerading as a planet .",
    "here we have shown how modeling the light curve of a candidate directly as a false positive allows to rule out a significant fraction of blends involving background or foreground eclipsing binaries or star - planet pairs , as well as hierarchical triple systems , each of these possibly attenuated by the light of additional stars .",
    "the combination of  with follow - up observations consisting of high - resolution imaging , spectroscopy , and an analysis of the centroid motion of the target leaves no room for a false positive in the case of kepler-9b and c. these signals were previously known to correspond to bona - fide saturn - size planets because they display correlated ttvs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the exercise serves to show that , lacking that evidence , it would still be possible to validate them using the same techniques , thus supporting the general approach and justifying the application to the more interesting kepler-9d signal .    among the advantages of  for  is the ability to predict the brightness and overall color of a blend in many different passbands .",
    "brightness information for virtually every  target is available from the kic in the sloan @xmath81 and 2mass @xmath82 bands , as well as in the custom d51 passband ( 518.7 nm ) .",
    "we have shown earlier how these can be used to rule out certain blend scenarios that might otherwise be viable .",
    "the detailed fitting of the photometry with a false - positive model provides additional discriminating power .",
    "rough estimates of the properties of a background eclipsing binary that can mimic a blend have sometimes been made in previous transit surveys based simply on the apparent brightness of the object and a representative depth for its undiluted eclipses ( such as 50% ) .",
    "while such configurations may well reproduce the observed amplitude of a candidate light curve , not much can be said about the expected shape , which may be completely wrong .",
    "an example of this is seen for kepler-9d in figure  [ fig:2p ] , in which a back - of - the - envelope calculation of the depth one might predict from the brightness and @xmath150% deep eclipses of this binary may not be far off , but the detailed shape is not a good match to the observations , and easily rules out this scenario giving a poor @xmath7 for the fit . without these additional constraints on blend properties provided by the detailed light - curve fitting , the space of parameters open to false positives would be significantly larger , and more difficult to exclude by other means .",
    "funding for this discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
    "we are grateful to leo girardi for computing isochrones for this work in the  passband , to frederic pont for very helpful discussions on false alarm probabilities , and to david sing for advice on limb - darkening coefficients .",

    "<S> a blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary ( or star - planet pair ) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture . </S>",
    "<S> we apply  to the case of kepler-9 , a target harboring two previously confirmed saturn - size planets ( kepler-9b and kepler-9c ) showing transit timing variations , and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-day period suggesting the presence of a super - earth - size planet . using  together with constraints from other follow - up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals , and provide independent validation of their planetary nature . for the shallower signal we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits . </S>",
    "<S> the false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part ( and inversely ) on the unknown frequency of small - size planets . </S>",
    "<S> based on several realistic estimates of this frequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super - earth - size planet ( kepler-9d ) in a multiple system , rather than a false positive . </S>",
    "<S> the radius is determined to be @xmath0 , and current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its mass . </S>"
