    "let @xmath2 be a mathematical crystal framework , by which we mean a connected structure in the euclidean space @xmath3 consisting of a set @xmath10 of framework edges ( bars or bonds ) with a corresponding set @xmath11 of framework vertices ( joints or atoms ) such that @xmath10 is periodic with respect to a discrete translation group @xmath12 of isometries of @xmath3 with full rank .",
    "we mainly consider the case @xmath13 together with the physical locally finite assumption in which @xmath10 is generated by the translations of a finite set of edges and vertices .",
    "such a geometric bar - joint framework @xmath2 serves as a model for the essential geometry of the disposition of atoms and bonds in a material crystal @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the vertices have atomic identifiers , such as h , he , li , b , ... , and the chosen edges may correspond to the strong bonds .",
    "the identification of strongly bonded molecular units , such as sio@xmath15 and tio@xmath16 , imply a polyhedral net structure for @xmath2 and in particular aluminosilicate crystals and zeolites provide a fascinating diversity of tetrahedral nets in which every vertex is shared by two tetrahedra .",
    "material scientists are interested in the manifestation and explanation of various forms of low energy motion and oscillation in materials . of particular interest",
    "are the rigid unit modes ( rums ) in crystals and zeolites .",
    "these are the low energy ( long wavelength ) modes of crystal lattice oscillation which are related to the relative motions of rigid units , such as the sio@xmath15 tetrahedral units in quartz .",
    "the wave vectors of these vibrational modes are observed in neutron scattering experiments and have been shown to correlate closely with those for the modes observed in numerical simulations with periodic networks of rigid units . in both the experimental measurements and in the computer simulations the background mathematical model is classical lattice dynamics and the rigid unit modes are observed where phonon dispersion curves display markedly low energy .",
    "there is now a considerable body of literature tabulating the rigid unit modes of various crystals and it has become evident that the primary determinant for these low energy modes in a material @xmath14 is the geometric structure of its abstract framework @xmath2 .",
    "this work shows that typically the wave vectors of rums lie along lines and planes in reciprocal space but there are surprises .",
    "firstly the wave vectors often lie on curved `` exotic '' surfaces in reciprocal space @xcite .",
    "secondly some zeolites have one or more rigid unit mode oscillation for every wave vector , representing an extraordinary degree of flexibility @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we shall demonstrate the mathematics of rigid unit modes is essentially a linear first order theory and one can side - step much of the lattice dynamical formulations that relate to higher energy phonons and their dispersion curves .",
    "this was outlined in the seminal paper of giddy , dove , pawley and heine @xcite and has been pursued effectively in the recent mathematical analysis of wegner @xcite .    motivated partly by material phenomena , in owen and power @xcite the rigid unit mode spectrum was formally defined for an abstract crystal framework @xmath2 with its translation group @xmath12 as the set @xmath17 of points @xmath18 arising from the nonzero _ infinitesimal flexes _ @xmath19 of @xmath2 which are @xmath12-periodic modulo the phase factor @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 , located in @xmath23 , is the reduced wave vector associated with @xmath19 .",
    "the rigid unit modes of @xmath2 are defined to be the infinitesimal flexes @xmath19 and so one may define the multiplicity of rigid unit modes for the pair @xmath24 with wave vector @xmath25 ( or phase point @xmath26 ) as a vector space dimension .",
    "see definitions [ d : infflex ] , [ d : rigiditymatrix ] , [ d : rumdefn1 ] , [ d : rumdefn2 ] .",
    "the infinitesimal flex perspective is useful in that it brings into play the well - established theory of infinitesimal rigidity for finite bar - joint frameworks .",
    "we show here that the consideration of general infinitesimal flexes in _ infinite bar - joint frameworks _ is effective in the analysis of the rum spectrum .",
    "for example the identification of infinitesimal flexes localised to lines and planes ( and appropriately partially phase - periodic ) leads to planes and lines ( respectively ) in the rum spectrum .",
    "we also see formally , in theorem [ p : longwavengthlimit ] that the vector space formulation of rigid unit modes for @xmath2 does correspond to the phenomenological appearance of rigid unit modes in materials and in simulations .",
    "that is , the phase of a phase - periodic infinitesimal flex corresponds to a wave vector for which the harmonic oscillation excitations of vertices ( atoms ) have vanishing bond deformations in the infinite wavelength ( slow oscillation ) limit .    in @xcite various flexibility and rigidity properties",
    "were considered for abstract crystal frameworks in @xmath1 dimensions . in the case of square - summable displacement vectors",
    "this lead to an associated matrix - valued function defined on the @xmath1-torus @xmath27 .",
    "this function , @xmath0 , arises from a representation of the infinite rigidity matrix for @xmath2 as a hilbert space multiplication operator for a matrix - valued function , known in toeplitz operator theory as the symbol function .",
    "the rum spectrum @xmath28 was shown to correspond to the set of points in @xmath27 where the null - space of @xmath29 is nontrivial . in the case of periodic tetrahedral nets ( mathematical zeolites )",
    "this is the set of zeros for the determinant of @xmath0 and the so the rum spectrum of the crystal framework is identified with the zero set of a multi - variable trigonometric polynomial on @xmath27 with real coefficients .    in what follows",
    "we give two direct derivations of @xmath0 which avoid hilbert space rigidity operators and we formalise the association of a unique multivariable polynomial with a well - constrained crystal framework .",
    "the first derivation is elementary and arises from the identification of the family of matrices that characterise the rigid unit modes as null eigenvectors .",
    "the second arises from an explicit block diagonalisation of the finite rigidity matrices associated with supercells and here @xmath0 appears as the `` completion '' of matrix - valued `` functions '' on finite subsets of the @xmath1-torus .",
    "a companion viewpoint to this is that the supercell rigidity matrices associated with fixed period infinitesimal motions are obtained by `` sampling '' @xmath0 at appropriate rational points of the @xmath1-torus .",
    "using block diagonalisation we analyse the asymptotic order of the number of periodic infinitesimal flexes , or floppy modes , associated with supercells .",
    "also we give an explicit formula for the number of periodic floppy modes associated with an @xmath30 supercell , which resolves a question posed by simon guest .",
    "this number is computable from the matrix function as the sum @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we also give a formal proof for a general crystal framework in @xmath3 that @xmath2 is of `` order @xmath9 '' if and only if @xmath34 has dimension @xmath1 ( and hence coincides with @xmath27 ) . here",
    "`` order @xmath9 '' means that with increasing supercell size the number of periodic floppy modes increases as the order of the number @xmath9 of atoms in the supercell . while it is generally true that in three dimensions , for example , order @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "order @xmath36 ) is equivalent to rum dimension @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "dimension @xmath37 ) when @xmath34 is standard , this may be in question if @xmath34 is exotic and does not admit a rational parametrisation .",
    "we also prove , by straightforward linear algebra , that order @xmath9 is equivalent to the existence of localised floppy modes .    in the final section",
    "we compute the rigid unit mode spectrum , the mode multiplicity and the crystal polynomial for various fundamental examples including the frameworks for @xmath38-cristobolite , sodalite and perovskite .",
    "we give the novelty of a two - dimensional framework with an exotic spectrum .",
    "this is defined by the simple requirement that the unit cell consist of an @xmath39-ring of congruent equilateral triangles bordering a regular octagon .",
    "its crystal polynomial @xmath40 has total degree @xmath41 and two explicit cubic factors which contribute two `` figure eight '' curves to the spectrum .",
    "also we indicate an approach to exotic curves and surfaces in terms of rum _ spectrum evolutions _ in which the spectrum evolve in response to the `` phase transition '' through a periodicity - preserving framework deformation .    with regard to order @xmath9 ,",
    "we show that it is possible for a `` two - dimensional zeolite '' to have order @xmath9 , which resolves a problem posed by mike thorpe . in three dimensions",
    "it has been known from experimental studies that the cubic symmetry form of sodalite exhibits a rigid unit mode for each wave vector .",
    "see dove - et - al @xcite , @xcite where this mode of flexibility is linked to material properties .",
    "we provide a direct geometric proof that @xmath42 has a localised infinitesimal flex and so for this reason has order @xmath9 .",
    "the focus in the sequel is for idealised crystal frameworks and the rum _ spectrum _ and mode multiplicity comply with the strict mathematical sense of the definitions . in particular",
    "this spectrum is a real algebraic variety . on the other hand material crystals , such as the aluminosilicates surveyed in @xcite ,",
    "have a rigid unit mode _ distribution _ determined experimentally .",
    "the accord between some of these sets of wave vectors underlines the efficacy of the rigid unit model as a primary determinant of low energy excitation modes in materials .",
    "the development here , which is self - contained , relates in part to themes and problems discussed at a london mathematical society workshop on _ the rigidity of frameworks and applications_. we briefly indicate some very recent papers that also address the rigidity and flexibility of periodic structures . on the mathematical side , borcea and streinu @xcite and malestein and theran @xcite",
    "examine periodic frameworks which are otherwise generic and in particular the latter paper obtains a combinatorial characterisation of periodic infinitesimal rigidity for frameworks in @xmath43 .",
    "ross , shulze and whiteley @xcite , on the other hand , consider periodic frameworks which are rich in symmetry but are otherwise generic and obtain counting conditions for the prediction of finite motions . in power @xcite we derive the borcea - streinu rigidity matrix given in @xcite and obtain maxwell - calladine and fowler - guest style equations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) for periodic frameworks .",
    "the flexibility considerations in these four papers are liberal in allowing affine deformation of the ( bravais ) lattice structure while maintaining framework periodicity with respect to the deforming lattice .",
    "such flexibility contrasts with the considerations here in which , on the one hand the lattice is fixed , an appropriate constraint for rum analysis , and on the other hand periodicity for infinitesimal flexes is relaxed to periodicity - modulo - phase .",
    "nevertheless there are interesting connections to explore between these perspectives , such as the analysis of rum evolutions indicated in section 5 . on the applications side , in addition to the work on rums indicated above we note that kapko , dawson , treacy and thorpe @xcite have computed the flexibility windows ( related to minimum and maximum volume deformation ) of the frameworks of ideal zeolites .",
    "the author is grateful for stimulating discussions and communications with martin dove , simon guest , john owen , mike thorpe , franz wegner and walter whiteley .",
    "we first define crystal frameworks and their matrix - valued functions and give the main ingredients of infinitesimal flexibility for translationally periodic bar - joint frameworks .",
    "the following notational conventions are adopted .",
    "we write @xmath44 for the label of a framework vertex in the unit cell , while @xmath45 denotes a general multi - index @xmath46 in @xmath47 and @xmath25 denotes a wave vector , as indicated above .",
    "we focus mainly on three - dimensional frameworks since the adaptations needed for the extension to @xmath48 are essentially notational .",

    "there are choices for the isometry group @xmath12 , since one may take subgroups , and there are further choices for motifs .",
    "it is natural to define the _ unit cell _ associated with @xmath12 , and its labelling , as the closed parallelepiped set determined by the vectors @xmath80 .",

    "of particular interest are the material zeolites , which are denoted by an upper case triple , such as  fau ,  pau ,  sod , rwy , ... , these often being a mnemonic for a material group indicator ( faujasite , paulingite , sodalite ,  , etc . ) .",
    "we write @xmath523 for the mathematical zeolite framework associated with the material zeolite  xyz when the geometry is unequivocal , as is the case for the cubic form of  sod   for example ( see below ) .",
    "note that while the databases often highlight the framework formed by `` @xmath524 atoms '' at the tetrahedral centres ( each being @xmath525-coordinated with neighbour @xmath524 atoms ) , we identify the tetrahedral net framework , corresponding to @xmath526 atoms as vertices .",
    "* example ( a ) : the regular 4-ring framework . * a fundamental @xmath97 zeolite @xmath527 is determined by the four - pointed star indicated in figure 4 .",
    "it is an instructive example in that it is sufficiently simple that one can deduce its rum spectrum and also its polynomial @xmath528 from infinitesimal arguments , by the band - limited arguments outlined in section 5.2 .",
    "note that there are four non - internal edges in the motif and so four rows of @xmath529 will carry monomials .",
    "thus @xmath530 has total degree at most @xmath525 .",
    "one can show that there are infinitesimal flexes of the finite subframeworks as indicated in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the top and bottom vertices of each are fixed by the flex .",
    "each flex extends by horizontal periodicity to a band - limited infinitesimal flex . in the former case",
    "there is two step horizontal periodicity while in the latter case there is strict horizontal periodicity although the band is two cells wide .        from the discussion in section 5.2",
    "the first band - limited flex shows that @xmath531 for all @xmath532 . by symmetry @xmath533 for all @xmath534 .",
    "thus @xmath28 contains the set @xmath535 it follows that @xmath530 is divisible by the irreducible factors @xmath536 .",
    "since @xmath530 has total degree at most @xmath525 it follows that either @xmath537 vanished identically or @xmath538 finally , note that former case does not hold .",
    "one can see this , thematically , by demonstrating that there are no local flexes .",
    "alternatively one may simply compute @xmath539 .",
    "thus the rum spectrum is precisely the fourfold union above .",
    "* examples ( b ) , ( c ) : deformation phases of @xmath540*. the regular 4-ring framework @xmath527 has a finite flex deformation , or phase transition , to a companion frameworks @xmath541 in which each @xmath39-ring of triangles borders a regular octahedron .",
    "we call @xmath541 the regular @xmath39-ring framework . a motif for the natural translation group is formed by an @xmath39-ring of @xmath542 edges with",
    "four boundary vertices omitted .",
    "see figure 5 .",
    "there are @xmath39 edges with external vertices and so the expectation is that @xmath543 has degree @xmath39 and this is the case . in particular",
    "it follows , from corollary [ c : localrum ] for example , that there are no localised rums anywhere in the infinite framework .",
    "no apparent band - limited infinitesimal flexes are present in this framework and indeed numerical calculation shows that there are no lines of wave vectors and that the rum spectrum is exotic , consisting of four closed disjoint curves on @xmath119 meeting at @xmath521 .    , with angle @xmath544 for @xmath545 , angle @xmath546 for @xmath541 ( in an offset position ) , angle @xmath547 for @xmath527 , rotated by @xmath548 , and angle @xmath549 , for @xmath541 , the regular @xmath39-ring framework.,width=377 ]    while the matrix - function @xmath550 is rather large , with @xmath542 rows and columns , it is sparse and its entries may be conveniently normalised by dividing each row by the magnitude of the @xmath504-coordinate difference .",
    "the magnitudes of the nonzero nonunit entries of the resulting matrix are then the tangents of the angles @xmath551 , for @xmath552 , all of which lie in the field extension @xmath553 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath554 @xmath555 and that this polynomial admits an explicit factorisation as a product @xmath556 where @xmath557 @xmath558        this approach leads to a rigourous algebraic determination of the exotic rum spectrum but it is nevertheless of interest to obtain a more intuitive understanding of such curves and their modes .",
    "one approach to this is in terms of _ rum spectrum evolution _ which we now sketch .",
    "figure 5 indicates four frameworks , say @xmath560 , determined by their unit cells .",
    "these frameworks are snapshots in a continuous smooth path , or deformation , @xmath561 from @xmath562 to @xmath563 which is driven by the indicated angle .",
    "the angle starts at @xmath544 and decreases to @xmath549 , the other snapshots being for @xmath546 and @xmath547 .",
    "notice that @xmath564 is a diagonal translate of @xmath565 and that @xmath566 is a rotation of @xmath527 by @xmath548 .",
    "these frameworks are endowed with the natural isometry group generated by horizontal and vertical motions , with differing period vectors .",
    "we have seen the rum spectrum of @xmath566 in example ( a ) .",
    "however , here the unit cell is doubled and is rotated by @xmath548 . accordingly the new rum spectrum is determined as the image of the old one under the `` doubling map '' @xmath567 , followed by axial rotation .",
    "it follows that @xmath568 in terms of reduced wave vectors this corresponds to the subset of the unit square @xmath569 given as the union of the two diagonals .    on the other hand one",
    "can show , by infinitesimal analysis , or by numerical calculation that @xmath570 is standard and , in terms of wave vectors , is simply the subset of the unit square @xmath569 given as the union of the axes .",
    "we can now view the rum spectrum of the regular @xmath39-ring framework @xmath564 as one picture in a path of sets from the axial set @xmath570 to the cross diagonals set @xmath571 .",
    "indeed the path of spectra @xmath572 , which we refer to as a _ rum evolution _",
    ", is the path of zero sets of a path of polynomials and can be analysed in such terms .",
    "* example ( d ) : a 2d zeolite with order n. * figure 7 shows the unit cell for a @xmath97 zeolite in which there are six framework vertices on the boundary .",
    "one can verify that there is a nonzero infinitesimal flex of the enclosed finite framework with zero displacements at the boundary vertices and a vertical displacement at the central vertex .",
    "thus the framework has a local rum and the rum spectrum is all of @xmath119 .    in general it need not be the case that an order @xmath9 crystal framework has a local rum internal to the unit cell .",
    "this is the case for the roman tile framework for example . also here",
    "one could take a new unit cell in which the central vertex is shifted to the boundary and in this case one has to consider a threefold supercell before a local rum appears .",
    "numerical calculation shows that the mode multiplicity function takes the following values on @xmath573 ; @xmath574 @xmath575 in particular the rum spectrum is standard and so also amenable to analysis in terms of band - limited flexes .",
    "* example ( e ) : roman tiling framework . *",
    "the next figure shows part of a two - dimensional framework @xmath463 which derives from a classical roman tiling of the plane by regular triangles , squares and hexagons . here",
    "the triangles are the rigid units of the framework .",
    "also the framework is @xmath525-regular and so in particular  @xmath463 is in maxwell counting equilibrium .",
    "the matrix function for a motif associated with a unit cell parallelogram enclosing six vertices is a @xmath576 by @xmath576 matrix in two variables .",
    "the framework evidently has many infinitesimal flexes .",
    "indeed for each linear square - hexagon channel there is an ( edge - length - preserving ) smooth deformation @xmath577 in which the channel undergoes parallel collapse .",
    "such a motion gives an infinitesimal flex @xmath578 .",
    "more apt to our discussion is the strictly periodic ( phase @xmath579 ) infinitesimal flex in which each triangle undergoes identical infinitesimal rotation about its centre .",
    "less evident perhaps are the localised infinitesimal flexes which are supported in a finite region .",
    "indeed there is an interesting minimal such flex @xmath19 which is zero outside a 2-fold supercell ( of four parallelograms ) and which imparts an infinitesimal clockwise `` hexagonal motion '' on a ring of six triangles in this supercell .",
    "it follows that @xmath463 is of order @xmath9 with full rum spectrum and that the crystal polynomial is identically zero .    curiously , despite the multi - deformability of the framework , the mode multiplicity function @xmath580 is simply given by @xmath581 and @xmath582 for @xmath583 .",
    "equivalently , in terms of the rigid unit mode wave excitations indicated in the next section , for the zero wave vector there is simply the two - dimensional space of trivial translation ( acoustic ) modes , while for each other wave vector there is a single rigid unit mode .",
    "this mode , say for wave vector @xmath584 in @xmath585 , corresponds to the infinitesimal flex @xmath508 derived from @xmath19 in terms of the well - defined ( `` slightly overlapping '' ) infinite sum @xmath586    * example ( f ) : @xmath38-cristobalite .",
    "* the so - called _ kagome net _ framework in three dimensions may be constructed in a layered manner as follows .",
    "place upward tetrahedra on alternate triangles of the two - dimensional kagome framework @xmath159 and place downward tetrahedra on the other triangles to create a framework layer .",
    "such layers are then fused together to fill space , creating the crystal framework we denote as @xmath587 .",
    "note first that the band - limited periodic infinitesimal flex arguments above can be applied to the two - dimensional kagome framework , just as in example ( a ) , to arrive at its polynomial directly ; @xmath588 note that a phase - periodic flex of the @xmath97 framework , with phase @xmath589 say , induces `` layer - limited '' infinitesimal flexes of the kagome net framework which are @xmath590 phase - periodic .",
    "it follows from the discussion in section 5.2 that for all @xmath591 there is a rigid unit mode @xmath19 of @xmath587 with phase @xmath592 .",
    "similar assertions hold for the other axial planes .",
    "any natural motif giving rise to the crystal polynomial @xmath593 shows that it has total degree at most @xmath41 . since our arguments show that it must vanish on the six planes @xmath594 it follows that @xmath595 for the monomial order with @xmath172 .",
    "the polynomial above was also obtained in @xcite and @xcite by calculation .",
    "the framework is also the tetrahedral net framework for @xmath38-cristobalite , @xcite ( and also happens to be associated with the recent material herbertsmithite ) .",
    "note that any @xmath97 zeolite @xmath2 which admits a two - colouring , with no like coloured triangles adjacent , similarly determines a @xmath596 zeolite @xmath597 by the layer construction .",
    "in particular this applies to @xmath527 and its phases @xmath598 . once again",
    "since the layers are effectively decoupled a rum phase @xmath599 for @xmath2 leads to a line @xmath600 in the rum spectrum of @xmath597 .",
    "* example ( g ) : sodalite .",
    "* we now define the sodalite framework @xmath42 which is a zeolite framework in three dimensions , with cubic symmetry , which is built from 4-rings of tetrahedra .",
    "( the tetrahedra represent  sio@xmath15 rigid units with silicon atoms at the centres and oxygen atoms at the vertices . )",
    "these 4-rings , so - called secondary building units in zeolite assembly @xcite , are oriented in the high symmetry arrangement indicated in figure 9 .",
    "six such rings may be placed on the the six faces of an imaginary cube so that vertices sit on the midpoints of the edges of the cube .",
    "this gives a finite bar - joint framework that we call the sodalite cage . with unit edge length for the tetrahedra",
    "the cube has sidelength @xmath601 while the unit cell for @xmath42 has side - length @xmath602 .",
    "a motif for the framework can be based on the set @xmath84 of edges in three pairwise - connected @xmath525-rings of the sodalite cage .",
    "the images of the edges of @xmath84 under the action of the associated isometry group @xmath12 , with orthogonal period vectors of length @xmath602 are disjoint and generate the crystal framework @xmath42 . for the set",
    "@xmath72 one could take the vertices @xmath84 except for the @xmath576 vertices furthest from the imaginary cube faces",
    ". there are @xmath542 such edges and the resulting matrix function has @xmath603 rows and @xmath603 columns .",
    "we prove that @xmath42 is of order @xmath9 .",
    "specifically we show , by infinitesimal flex geometry , that there is a nonzero infinitesimal flex @xmath508 of the finite sodalite cage framework such that all the outer vertices are fixed by @xmath508 .",
    "that is , @xmath604 if @xmath605 is an outer vertex of the cage .",
    "the `` outer fixed '' sodalite cage framework has @xmath606 free vertices with @xmath607 degrees of freedom while there are @xmath608 constraining edges . despite this considerable over - constraint",
    "there is sufficient symmetry to allow in a one - dimensional space of infinitesimal flexes .",
    "we show below that an individual @xmath525-ring , @xmath609 say , of the sodalite cage has an infinitesimal flex , @xmath610 say , which fixes the quadruple of outer vertices ( the upper vertices in figure 9 . ) in this flex the mirror quadruple vertices have equal magnitude displacement vectors which are directed towards two opposing corners of the imaginary cube .",
    "see figure 9 .",
    "taking @xmath610 so that these vectors have magnitude @xmath37 it follows that @xmath610 is determined up to sign and that this sign may be specified by labeling the cube corners `` a '' and `` r '' for their attracting and repelling sense .",
    "note that one can label the eight corners of the imaginary cube in this manner so that no like labels are adjacent . in this case",
    "the implied flexes @xmath611 of the six @xmath525 rings of the sodalite cage have equal displacement vectors at common vertices .",
    "this consistency show that there is an infinitesimal flex of the entire sodalite cage in which the outer vertices are fixed , as required .",
    "it remains only to show that there is the stated flex of the @xmath525-ring @xmath609 one can confirm this by computation or , more revealingly and thematically , by the following simple symmetric infinitesimal flex argument .",
    "let @xmath612 be two non - opposite top vertices of @xmath609 with intermediate vertex @xmath613 , let @xmath614 be the vertices of an inward facing face of a tetrahedron of @xmath609 with vertices @xmath615 , so that the lower vertex @xmath616 is a cube - edge midpoint .",
    "there is a unique ( oblique ) `` upward '' displacement velocity @xmath617 of the intermediate vertex @xmath613 which has unit length and is such @xmath618 is a flex for the two edges @xmath619 , [ p_3,p_2]$ ] .",
    "the displacement vector @xmath617 induces a unique displacement vector @xmath620 which is in the direction of the cube edge and is such that @xmath621 the triple @xmath622 and @xmath620 now determine the infinitesimal motion of the tetrahedron , with flex vector @xmath623 for @xmath624 .",
    "however , the reversal ( sign change ) of @xmath617 induces the reversal of @xmath620 so it is clear from the symmetric position of the tetrahedron that @xmath623 must be the unique unit norm ( oblique ) downward flex at @xmath624 .",
    "continuing around the ring it follows that @xmath609 has the desired infinitesimal flex .",
    "one can apply similar arguments to other zeolite frameworks and of course to any such frameworks that contain a sodalite cage .",
    "also we note , as do kapko et al @xcite , that @xmath625 is derived from @xmath42 simply by replacing each tetrahedron by a rigid unit of four tetrahedra .",
    "thus the same infinitesimal flex geometry applies and @xmath625 has order @xmath9 .",
    "* example ( h ) : perovskite .",
    "* let @xmath626 be the crystal framework formed by corner linked octahedra in maximal symmetry arrangement .",
    "more precisely , @xmath626 has the integer translation group @xmath12 and motif @xmath68 where @xmath627 and @xmath84 consists of the twelve framework edges between the centres of adjacent faces of the unit cell @xmath628 .",
    "thus the vertices of @xmath252 have the form @xmath629 , where @xmath630 .",
    "the framework is not in maxwell counting equilibrium , being over - constrained , but has considerable symmetry .",
    "the frameworks feature in cubic perovskites , such as  sito@xmath631 , and rum distributions have been determined experimentally @xcite , @xcite . to derive @xmath632 analytically by flex analysis we first obtain @xmath633 , since the square lattice appears in two dimensional cross - sections for the three axial directions .",
    "performing row operations on @xmath634 , as given in section 2 , we see that @xmath635 is a point of the rum spectrum if and only if the equivalent matrix @xmath636\\ ] ] has rank less than @xmath525 .",
    "this occurs if and only if @xmath637\\ ] ] has rank equal to @xmath638 or @xmath37 .",
    "the rank is @xmath638 if and only if @xmath639 , corresponding to the two - dimensional space of rigid motions ( translational infinitesimal flexes ) with phase @xmath579 , and the rank is @xmath37 if and only if @xmath640 .",
    "thus @xmath641 the infinitesimal flex for the phase @xmath642 is the one for which the rigid units , in this case squares with diagonals , rotate infinitesimally in alternating senses .",
    "note now that this alternating rotation flex of @xmath154 induces a plane - localised flex of @xmath626 in each of the framework planes @xmath643 . by the argument in section 5 it follows that @xmath632 contains",
    "the three sets of phases , @xmath644 that the spectrum is no more than the union of these sets and the singleton @xmath521 can be seen from a row analysis of the @xmath576 by @xmath645 function matrix @xmath646 in the same style as the argument for @xmath154 .",
