    "seyfert1 galaxies with small widths ( @xmath12000 kms@xmath3 ) of the permitted emission lines coming from the broad line region ( blr ) have been given a separate name _",
    "narrow line seyfert1 galaxies ( nlsy1 ) _ , although they probably do not form a class physically separated from classical sy1s .",
    "close attention was drawn to them resulting from the discovery that steep soft x - ray spectra of agns are almost always associated with nlsy1s @xcite .",
    "it was also claimed that x - ray selected samples contain considerably more nlsy1s than optically selected ones @xcite . since sy1 galaxies are not the most luminous examples of agns , we searched for similar effects among quasars , their high luminosity counterparts .",
    "we analyzed the hamburg database of optical agn spectra to determine the fraction of nlsy1s in optically and x - ray selected samples , to search for _ narrow line qsos _ , and to study the relation between soft x - ray spectral index and linewidth , as a function of luminosity .",
    "the hamburg database of optical agn spectra consists of several data sets obtained from follow - up spectroscopy of agn candidates , identified from the objective prism plates of the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first set ( hereafter : rass ) contains spectra of x - ray selected agns discovered by the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "253 spectra were taken from @xcite and 189 spectra are yet unpublished .",
    "rosat x - ray selected agns have typical redshifts z=0.2 and optical brightnesses b=1819 mag .    the second set ( hereafter : hqs )",
    "contains the spectra of agns optically selected from the hqs plates , and consists of 123 spectra from the lists of @xcite and @xcite , and 112 spectra from the hamburg / cfa bright quasar survey @xcite .",
    "the hqs agns generally have b@xmath118 mag . in both sets we restricted the redshifts to z@xmath10.7 .",
    "the database is inhomogeneous , as the spectra differ in resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we singled out spectra with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to obtain reliable measures of linewidths using gaussian fits . because of the differing optical limits of both sets , the hqs sample is biased towards quasars ( defined as agns with m@xmath4@xmath7 ) , and the rass sample is biased towards seyfert galaxies ( figure [ mabs ] )",
    "the h@xmath0  linewidth distribution is markedly different for the seyfert galaxies and the quasars ( figure [ hbeta]a ) .",
    "the latter group has a median linewidth of @xmath1v@xmath2 = 4300 kms@xmath3  compared to 3000 kms@xmath3  for the seyferts .",
    "this difference does not depend on the selection method .",
    "both distributions have a long tail extending up to 10000 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the handful of quasars with fwhm(h@xmath0)@xmath12000 kms@xmath3  only marginally surpass the luminosity cut - off , which was set arbitrarily . in figure",
    "[ hbeta]b we plot the fraction @xmath8 of narrow line agns as function of absolute magnitude . in both samples",
    "none are found at luminosities m@xmath4@xmath9 , indicating that broad - line regions with very small velocities exist only among low luminosity agns : there are no _ narrow line qsos_. the non - existent nlqsos should not be confused with _ type 2 qsos _ , which are the high - luminosity counterparts of seyfert 2s , and have not been found either .",
    "the fraction of nlsy1s rises to 2030% for m@xmath4@xmath10 , irrespective of the selection method .",
    "x - ray spectral photon indices @xmath6 were calculated from the hardness ratios as described by @xcite .",
    "figure [ gamma ] plots @xmath6 vs. fwhm(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "seyfert galaxies occupy the same area as in @xcite , except that the sample contains no _ ultrasoft _ x - ray agns ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "both seyfert galaxies and quasars show a modest anti - correlation between @xmath6 and h@xmath0linewidth .",
    "this is consistent with the model of wandel & boller @xcite , who attribute this relation to an increased ionizing flux associated with the steeper x - ray spectral slopes . for a given black hole mass",
    "this shifts the blr radius outwards leading to smaller velocities .",
    "the h@xmath0  linewidths are thought to reflect the velocity dispersion in the blr .",
    "we found that this dispersion increases with agn luminosity , as does the blr radius @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the central black hole masses must increase as well , if the cloud motions are virialized .",
    "narrow line agns are common among low luminosity agns ( seyferts ) , and their x - ray properties in general do not differ from other agns . the larger number of nlsy1s detected in x - ray surveys is due to the higher selection efficiency of seyfert 1s in general , compared to optical surveys . there",
    "appear to be no physical differences between x - ray and optically selected narrow line agns .",
    "we have not found objects with extreme @xmath6 s ( @xmath12 ) , which were so obvious in the sample of @xcite .",
    "it seems that these _ ultrasoft _ agns are very rare , and that they are only picked - up in surveys with high efficiency in the soft x - ray band .",
    "they may not be restricted to low luminosities , as at least one example in known eg .",
    "rx  j0947.0 + 4721 with a qso luminosity @xcite .",
    "rx  j0947.0 + 4721 was discovered in a pointed rosat observation , and the rass might not have been sensitive enough to detect more of them .",
    "the rarity of _ ultrasoft _ agns may be a consequence of the transient nature of the _ ultrasoft _ state , which may be short compared to the timescales that the nuclei are active .",
