    "since markowitz ( 1952 ) formulated the idea of diversification of investments , the mean - variance approach has been widely used in practice in asset allocation and portfolio management , despite many sophisticated models proposed in literature . on the other hand , some drawbacks of the standard markowitz approach are reported in literature ( michaud ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "one of the critical weaknesses of the classical mean - variance analysis is its lack of robustness . since the classical estimators of the mean and the covariance matrix , which are inputs in the optimization procedure , are very sensitive to the presence of gross errors or atypical events in data , the weights of the resulted portfolio , which are outputs of this procedure , can be drastically affected by these atypical data",
    "this fact was proved by perret - gentil and victoria - feser ( 2005 ) by using the influence function approach .",
    "also , some other recent papers underline this idea and show that the large or small values of asset returns can have an abnormally large influence on the estimations leading to portfolio that are far to be optimal ( grossi and laurini ( 2011 ) ) . in order to remove this drawback and to construct portfolios",
    "not overly affected by deviations of the data from the assumed model , many methods have been proposed in literature . for an overview on the methods used for robust portfolio optimization we refer to fabozzi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . among the methods which improve the stability of portfolio weights by using robust estimators of the mean and covariance , we recall those proposed by vaz - de melo and camara ( 2005 ) which use m - estimators , perret - gentil and victoria - feser ( 2005 ) which use the translated biweight s - estimator , welsch and zhou ( 2007 ) which use minimum covariance determinant estimator and winsorization , demiguel and nogales ( 2009 ) which use both m- and s - estimators , ferrari and paterlini ( 2010 ) which use maximum l@xmath0-likelihood estimators .",
    "these contributions have the merit to consider the role of robust estimation for improving the mean - variance portfolios .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that traditional robust estimators suffer dramatic looses in efficiency compared with the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "therefore , a trade - off between robustness and efficiency should be carefully analyzed .",
    "our contribution to robust portfolio optimization is developed within a minimum pseudodistance framework .",
    "we can say that the minimum pseudodistance methods for estimation take part to the same cathegory with minimum divergence methods .",
    "the minimum divergence estimators are defined by minimizing some appropriate divergence between an assumed model and the true model underlying the data .",
    "depending on the choice of the divergence , minimum divergence estimators can afford considerable robustness at minimal loss of efficiency .",
    "however , the classical approaches based on divergence minimization require nonparametric density estimation , which can be problematic in multi - dimensional settings .",
    "some proposals to avoid the nonparametric density estimation in minimum divergence estimation have been made by basu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and broniatowski and keziou ( 2009 ) and robustness properties of their estimators have been studied by toma and leoni - aubin ( 2010 ) , toma and broniatowski ( 2011 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider estimators of location and covariance obtained by minimizing a family of pseudodistances .",
    "these estimators have the advantages of not requiring any prior smoothing and conciliate robustness with high efficiency , usually requiring distinct techniques .",
    "the minimum pseudodistance estimators have been introduced by broniatowski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and consist in minimization of an empirical version of a pseudodistance between the assumed model and the true model underlying the data .",
    "this method can be applied to any parametric model , but in the present paper we focus on the multivariate normal location - scale model .",
    "the behavior of the estimator depends on a tuning positive parameter @xmath1 which controls the trade - off between robustness and efficiency .",
    "when the data are consistent with normality and @xmath2 , the estimation method corresponds to the maximum likelihood method ( mle ) which is known to have full asymptotic efficiency at the model .",
    "when @xmath3 , the estimator gains robustness , while keeping high efficiency .",
    "the new minimum pseudodistance estimators can be easily used in place of the classical mean and covariance matrix estimators , thereby providing robust and efficient mean - variance optimized portfolios .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we shortly describe the markowitz s mean - variance model whose inputs are estimations of location and covariance of asset returns . the minimum pseudodistance estimators of location and covariance are introduced in section 3 . here",
    "we prove theoretical properties of these estimators , such as the affine equivariance and b - robustness .",
    "we also determine the asymptotic covariance matrices of the estimators and discuss the asymptotic relative efficiency .",
    "the estimators of the portfolio weights together with their properties are presented in section 4 . in sections 5 and 6 , a monte carlo simulation study and then an application on real data show the advantages of the new approach .",
    "we consider a portfolio formed by @xmath4 financial assets .",
    "the returns of the assets are characterized by the random vector @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the random variable associated to the return of the asset @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the vector of weights associated to the portfolio , where @xmath10 represents the proportion of the investor s capital invested in the asset @xmath7 .",
    "the total return of the portfolio is given by the random variable @xmath11    supposing that the random vector @xmath12 follows a multivariate normal distribution @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the vector containing the mean returns of the assets and @xmath15 is the covariance matrix of the returns of the assets , the mean of the portfolio return can be written as @xmath16 and the portfolio variance as @xmath17    the markowitz approach for optimal portfolio selection consists in solving the following optimization problem .",
    "for a given investor s risk aversion @xmath18 , the mean - variance optimization selects the portfolio @xmath19 , solution of @xmath20 with the constraint @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the @xmath23 vector of ones .",
    "the set of optimal portfolios for all possible values of the risk aversion parameter @xmath24 defines the mean - variance efficient frontier .",
    "the solution of the above optimization problem is explicit and the optimal portfolio weights , for a fixed value of @xmath24 , are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 this is the case when short selling is allowed .",
    "when short selling is not allowed , we have a supplementary constraint in the optimization problem , namely all the weights @xmath10 are positive .",
    "when the true parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the portfolio weights are all known , then we have the true efficient frontier .",
    "an estimated efficient frontier can be obtained by using estimators of the mean and covariance matrix . throughout this paper",
    "we denote by @xmath27 and @xmath28 the estimators of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and by @xmath29 the estimator of the optimal portfolio weights , as resulting with ( [ f1 ] ) @xmath30.\\ ] ] the mean and the covariance matrix of the returns are in practice estimated by their sample counterparts , i.e. the maximum likelihood estimators under the multivariate normal model .",
    "it is known that , under normality , the maximum likelihood estimators are the most efficient . however , in the presence of outlying observations , the asymptotic bias of these estimators can be arbitrarily large and this bias is induced to the corresponding optimal portfolio weights .",
    "for this reason , @xmath14 and @xmath15 should be robustly estimated .",
    "in the following , for the robust estimation of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 we consider minimum pseudodistance estimators . for two probability measures @xmath31 and @xmath32 , admitting densities @xmath33 , respectively @xmath34 with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath24 , the pseudodistances that we consider are defined through @xmath35 for @xmath3 and satisfy the limit relation @xmath36 note that @xmath37 coincides with the modified kullback - leibler divergence .",
    "let @xmath38 be a parametric model with parameter space @xmath39 and assume that every probability measure @xmath40 in @xmath38 has a density @xmath41 with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the family of minimum pseudodistance estimators of the unknown parameter @xmath42 is obtained by replacing the hypothetical probability measure @xmath43 in the pseudodistances @xmath44 by the empirical measure @xmath45 pertaining to the sample and then minimizing @xmath46 with respect to @xmath47 on the parameter space .",
    "let @xmath48 be a sample on @xmath49 and denote by @xmath50 the parameter of interest .",
    "a minimum pseudodistance estimator @xmath51 of @xmath47 is defined by @xmath52 which can be written equivalently as @xmath53{ll}% \\arg\\sup_{\\theta}\\frac{1}{tc_{\\alpha}(\\theta)}\\sum_{i=1}^{t}p_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}(x^{i } ) & \\text { \\ \\ \\ } \\mbox{if}\\ \\alpha>0\\medskip\\\\ \\arg\\sup_{\\theta}\\frac { { 1 } } { { t}}\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\ln p_{{\\theta}}(x^{i } ) & \\text { \\ \\ \\ } % \\mbox{if}\\text { } \\alpha=0 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the @xmath4-variate normal density @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that , the choice @xmath56 leads to the definition of the classical mle . throughout the paper we will also use the notation @xmath57^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath58 and then , for @xmath3 the minimum pseudodistance estimator ( [ mpe ] ) can be expressed as @xmath59          the location and dispersion estimators defined above are affine equivariant .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are estimators corresponding to a sample @xmath63 , then @xmath64 for any @xmath65 nonsingular matrix @xmath66 and any @xmath67 .    indeed , let @xmath66 be a @xmath65 nonsingular matrix , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "the estimators @xmath70 and @xmath71 are solutions of the system obtained from ( [ sys1 ] ) and ( [ sys2 ] ) by replacing @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
