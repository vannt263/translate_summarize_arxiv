    "quantum compass model @xcite has recently attracted great interests @xcite .",
    "it was originally proposed as a simplified model to describe some mott insulators with orbit degeneracy described by a pseudospin . in particular",
    ", compass model describes a system where the anisotropy of the spin coupling is related to the orientation of bonds .",
    "more recently , it was also proposed as a realistic model to generate protected qubits @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the eigenstates of the quantum compass model are two and only two fold degenerate @xcite .",
    "the two - fold degenerate ground state can be an implementation of a protected qubit if it is separated from the low energy excitations by a finite gap .",
    "symmetry will protect weak noise destroying the degeneracy . based on the protected qubits , which has high quality factor , a",
    "scalable and error - free schema of quantum computation can be designed@xcite .",
    "the two - fold degenerate state has been shown to be gapped from low energy excitations based on the results calculated in a small size system@xcite .",
    "however , the results can not be extended to large size systems .",
    "the results from both spin wave study and exact diagonalization have suggested that the system develops a spontaneously symmetry - broken state in the thermodynamic limit@xcite . in the spin - wave study",
    ", the hamiltonian is expanded around the uniform classical ground state up to the first order of @xmath1 .",
    "it is found that there is a directional ordering of the ground state@xcite . from finite size diagonalization of samples with size up to @xmath2",
    ", it is shown that on clusters of dimension @xmath3 , the low - energy spectrum consists of @xmath4 states which collapse onto each other exponentially fast with @xmath5 . at the symmetric point of @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath6 states collapse exponentially fast with @xmath5 onto the ground state . from both of the spin - wave analysis and exact diagonalization",
    ", a first order phase transition at the symmetric point seems most favorable .",
    "however , the spin - wave analysis ignores very important fluctuations while the exact diagonalization is limited by small sample size . in this work ,",
    "we first show that the spin-@xmath7 quantum compass model on a square lattice can be exactly mapped to a fermionic model with local density interactions .",
    "normally , after performing a jordan - wigner transformation , one expects a non - local gauge interaction between fermions in the fermionic hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "however , due to the special structure of both the spin interactions and the lattice , we show that the gauge interaction for the compass model is absent , which allows us to apply conventional approximation techniques developed for electron systems to analyze the original spin model .",
    "our approximation method automatically takes into account the most important fluctuations , those perpendicular to the ordering direction .",
    "the remaining fluctuations can also be studied in the perturbative approach .",
    "it is shown that our conclusion is robust against the perturbative corrections .",
    "our results support that a first order phase transition happens at @xmath8 between two different states with spin ordering along either @xmath9 or @xmath10 directions .",
    "the compass model appears rather simple on the first look , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a two dimensional coordinate .",
    "the sign of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is not important .",
    "we can always introduce a transformation to bring them into @xmath15 .",
    "we assume temperature @xmath16 throughout this work and set @xmath17 for simplicity .",
    "this model has some interesting symmetries , which have been discussed in details in literature @xcite .",
    "we first recall two types of symmetry generators of this model@xcite @xmath18 it has been shown that the symmetry of this model leads to a one - dimension type of behavior and directional ordering @xcite .",
    "it is also shown @xcite that this model is dual to recently studied models of @xmath19 superconducting arrays@xcite , which also show the effect of dimensional reduction @xcite .    with the help of the symmetry operators defined in eq.([symmetry - pq ] ) , we find that it is possible to fermionize the full compass model .",
    "the resulted fermionic model has bcs - type pairing along one direction and nearest neighboring interactions along the other direction .",
    "the jordan - winger transformation can be defined as @xmath20\\right)c^\\dag_{i , j}\\\\ s^z_{i , j}&=&c^\\dag_{i , j}c_{i , j}^{}-\\frac{1}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 annihilates a fermion at site @xmath12 .",
    "the original compass model eq.([h - full ] ) is transformed into @xmath22 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to a constant .",
    "because the interaction along @xmath10 direction is quartic , the string - type interaction or gauge interaction disappears .",
    "the symmetries defined in eq.([symmetry - pq ] ) also have profound implications on the possible ordering of this model .",
    "based on the fact that @xmath23=[q_j , q_{j'}]=[p_i , q_jq_{j'}]=[p_ip_{i'},q_j]=0 $ ] and @xmath24\\neq 0 $ ] , it is found that each eigenstate of this model is two and only two fold degenerate @xcite .",
    "this leads to the observation that any finite system can not have an ordering that is characterized by some finite mean - field expectation value of either or both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , let us assume the ground state @xmath27 of a @xmath3 system has finite @xmath26 .",
    "one can thus apply @xmath28 onto @xmath27 and obtain @xmath4 degenerate ground state , which is of course inconsistent with the above result of double - degeneracy .",
    "however , ordering is still possible when the system goes to the thermodynamic limit where spontaneous symmetry breaking happens .",
    "the excitation gap that separates the true ground state and other @xmath29 low energy excitation states collapses exponentially as the system size goes to infinity@xcite . in this case , the spontaneously broken symmetries are the @xmath30 symmetries of the one - dimensional ising chain along the ordering direction .",
    "let us consider a system @xmath31 and let both @xmath32 and @xmath33 increase to infinity .",
    "if the ordering is along the @xmath10 direction , one should observe @xmath34 states collapse onto the true ground state and the gap vanishes exponentially , namely @xmath35 with some length scale @xmath36 .",
    "since the spontaneously broken symmetries are a large number of copies of discrete symmetry @xmath30 , there is no corresponding goldstein mode .",
    "furthermore , one can also effectively view this spontaneously symmetry breaking as the breaking of a set of local @xmath30 symmetries in a one - dimensional problem , which is along @xmath9 if the ordering is along @xmath10 .",
    "this does not violates the elitzur s theorem @xcite since in this case the effective local @xmath30 symmetry is realized by a infinitely long ising chain and thus the energy barrier to restore the symmetry is still infinite",
    ".    we shall now consider the phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we start from two extreme cases which are trivial to solve .",
    "we then study how the system evolves from one extreme to the other .",
    "it turns out that by studying this question it is possible to obtain the phase diagram as we shall show below .",
    "let us first start from the simplest limit @xmath37 , where the model reduces to decoupled ising chains .",
    "the ground state is magnetically ordered such that @xmath38 up to an overall flip of all spins of each ising chain .",
    "this ordered state thus has @xmath4 degeneracy for a @xmath3 system .",
    "similarly , at the limit of @xmath39 , the spins are ordered along @xmath9 direction .",
    "we are thus interested in how the spins rotate from @xmath10 direction to @xmath9 direction as the ratio @xmath40 changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 and what is the possible ground state at @xmath0 . in very general , there are four possible scenarios .",
    "the first possibility is that there is no phase transition .",
    "the spins rotate continuously from @xmath10 to @xmath9 through a crossover .",
    "the second scenario corresponds to two second order phase transitions with coexisting of ordering along both @xmath10 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "the third possibility is two second order phase transitions with disordered state in between .",
    "the fourth one is that the spins suddenly change from @xmath9 direction to @xmath10 direction , i.e. , a first order phase transition happens at @xmath43 .      to find out which of the four possible scenarios happens",
    ", we start with limit @xmath37 , where the system is ordered along @xmath10 direction , and increase @xmath13 ( or decrease the ratio @xmath44 ) .",
    "as @xmath13 is increased , the flipping of two spins on adjacent chains is introduced .",
    "this process tends to reduce the ordered moment along the @xmath10-direction . on the other hand , the ordering along @xmath10 direction acts as an effective transverse field and suppresses the ordering along @xmath9 direction of the spins on adjacent chains .",
    "this effect is described by a 1d ising chain with a transverse field , which has a critical transverse field @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 is much smaller than @xmath14 , the ordering of spins along @xmath9 direction is fully suppressed by the adjacent spins ordered along @xmath10 direction .",
    "we then ask at what value of @xmath13 the spins start to order along the @xmath9 direction . for the crossover case",
    ", @xmath45 has a finite value as long as @xmath13 is not zero .",
    "for the second scenario , two second order phase transitions with intermediate coexisting state , @xmath46 starts to develop at some value of @xmath47 that is larger than @xmath48 .",
    "for the last two cases , the expectation value of @xmath49 is zero for all @xmath50 , while @xmath51 takes a finite value for all @xmath52 in the first order phase transition scenario . to determine the behavior of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we self - consistently study the mean - field decoupled hamiltonian @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mean - field decoupling is justified , since we start from the situation where @xmath56 is ordered and want to know when @xmath57 starts to develop a finite expectation value .",
    "this mean field decoupled hamiltonian describes the most important fluctuation in the state with spins ordered along @xmath10 direction .",
    "the ordering along @xmath9 direction is suppressed by the ordering along @xmath10 direction , which behaves as an effective transverse field for @xmath49 . on the other hand , the feedback effect on @xmath58 due to @xmath49 fluctuations is also included in this approach through the self - consistent condition @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ground state of the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath61 . to minimize the ground state energy ,",
    "it is favorable to have @xmath26 @xmath62-independent , _ i.e. _ , the moment on the same chain is uniform such that the @xmath14 terms are minimized .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian thus describes a series of decoupled ising chains with an effective transverse magnetic field @xmath63 that is determined self - consistently .    to minimize the coupling energy along @xmath10-direction",
    ", one would expect @xmath64 is @xmath65-independent . if @xmath66 , we can rotate the spins on @xmath65-th row by an angle @xmath67 around the @xmath9-axis . without losing generality , we can thus consider the case where @xmath68",
    ".    in the fermionic language , the mean - field decoupling introduced in eq.([h ] ) corresponds to the decoupling of the interaction term @xmath69 into an effective chemical potential term @xmath70 with @xmath71 this hamiltonian can be diagonalized using bogoliubov transformation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is fourier transformation of @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be solved to yield @xmath77}\\\\      v_k & = & i\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[1-\\frac{(\\cos k)/2-\\mu}{e_k}\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that the expectation value of @xmath56 is @xmath79 the self - consistent equation thus reads @xmath80    ) .",

    "the jump happens at @xmath84 .",
    "below @xmath85 , which is the critical point of the ising chain in a transverse magnetic field , @xmath49 starts to develop a nonzero expectation value .",
    "we notice two important results that can help us determine the phase diagram .",
    "firstly , the critical point @xmath85 happens at a @xmath47 smaller than the symmetry point @xmath86 , below which ordering along @xmath10 direction is no longer a reasonable assumption . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the ordering along @xmath9 direction is instead more favorable .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 can not develop a finite value for @xmath50 .",
    "the first two scenarios , namely crossover scenario and two second - order phase transitions scenario , are thus excluded .",
    "secondly , the self - consistent equation has non - trivial solutions for @xmath88 , which means spins order along @xmath10 direction for @xmath52 . combining these two points ,",
    "we conclude that there is a first order phase transition at @xmath86 . at @xmath89 ,",
    "the spins are ordered along @xmath10 direction while they are along @xmath9 direction for @xmath87 . at @xmath86 ,",
    "the spins are either along @xmath9 or @xmath10 direction since our argument above shows that the ordering at @xmath86 along @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) direction induces a strong enough transverse field to suppress the ordering along @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) direction .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the spin - wave analysis@xcite . in spin wave analysis ,",
    "fluctuations of both directions are taken into account partially . in our approach",
    ", the most important fluctuations , namely the ordering direction of weaker bond , is solved exactly .",
    "although the mean - field approximation has included the most important fluctuations , there is still concerns about the effect of the ignored fluctuations . to further study the effect of fluctuations , we calculate the energy gap by perturbation .",
    "the perturbation comes from the interaction terms that are ignored in the mean - field hamiltonian eq.([h ] ) @xmath90    in terms of feynman diagrams , there are hence two kinds of vertices : two - particle interaction vertex and external field interaction .",
    "let us first work out the feynman rules for the two - particle interactions .",
    "we observe that the interactions are between particles on nearest neighboring lines .",
    "the vertex of two - particle interaction thus consists of three parts , the coupling strength , the contribution from @xmath62-th line and the contribution from the neighboring @xmath91-th or @xmath92-th line .",
    "there are four possible types of contributions , which are given in fig.[fig - bcoeff ] with @xmath93    -th line to the vertex . ]",
    "the first line corresponds to @xmath94 . in this section",
    ", we will use @xmath95 to denote the expectation value of operator @xmath96 in the un - perturbed mean - field ground state .",
    "this term can be obtained by contraction from either @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "the coherence factor of @xmath99 in the two - particle interaction is @xmath100 while the one of @xmath101 is @xmath102 .",
    "taking into account of the sign difference between these two contractions , we find @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , we get the results for other three possibilities .",
    "the resulted vertex for two - particle interaction is thus @xmath104 with corresponding feynman diagram sketched in fig.[fig - vertex ] . here",
    ", we have not shown the arrows associated with @xmath105 .",
    "these arrows determine the corresponding subscripts of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the corresponding momentum conservation law for the vertex is @xmath108 where the signs of @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the first and second subscripts of @xmath111 .",
    "for instance , the momentum conservation for @xmath112 is @xmath113 .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the vertex for the external field term as illustrated in fig.[fig - vertex - external ]        we are now at position to calculate the feynman rule for bubbles .",
    "the clockwise bubble corresponds to @xmath114 with coherence factor @xmath115 while the counterclockwise one is @xmath116 with coherence factor @xmath117 .",
    "the feynman rules for bubble and propagator of particle is shown in fig.[fig - bubble ] a noticeable difference between this propagator and the one in the familiar case of electrons under coulomb repulsion is that we only have the plus sign before the infinitesimal imaginary part .",
    "this is because in the current system , we do nt have a fermi sea as ground state and therefore do not have a hole propagator .",
    "this property of system largely reduces the number of diagrams we need to calculate .",
    "finally , every intermediate 4-momentum should be integrated with a factor of @xmath118 .            with all the feynman rules in hands , we are now ready to do perturbative calculations .",
    "the first order correction to the self - energy is given in fig.[fig-1st ] .",
    "the first term is the contribution from the interaction with nearest neighbor lines .",
    "the factor @xmath119 comes from the fact that there are two nearest neighbor lines .",
    "the second term is from the  external field \" term in eq.([eq - interaction ] ) .",
    "the first order perturbation vanishes in the mean - field decoupling of eq.([h ] ) .",
    "the leading order correction is thus second order perturbation given by the connected amputated graphs as shown in fig.[fig - second - order ] .",

    "solid lines are the results with second order perturbation included while dash lines are mean - field results.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    .",
    "there are five pieces of nonzero second order correction to the single particle propagator .",
    "we detail the calculation of them separately .",
    "the first two diagrams denote the self - energy process involving two particle - particle interactions .",
    "the overall factor of two stems from the fact that a particle on the , say , @xmath62th chain can either interact with the @xmath92th or the @xmath91th chain .",
    "the relative minus in the bracket is there because we invert three ( an odd number ) of the propagators in the second diagram .",
    "direct application of the feynman rules we derived yields @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the contributions from the first and second pieces of fig.[fig - second - order ] respectively .",
    "the intermediate frequencies @xmath124 and @xmath125 have been integrated .",
    "the third and the fourth diagrams denote self - energy processes involving one particle - particle interaction and one external field perturbation . the factor of 2 stems from the same argument and the overall negative sign can be obtained by working out the contractions .",
    "their analytical expressions @xmath126 and @xmath127 read @xmath128 where again , the intermediate frequency has been integrated .",
    "the last piece of the expression denotes process that involves two external field perturbation .",
    "it is easy to obtain the analytical expression as @xmath129    in this way , we have exhausted all possible self - energy processes to the second order of @xmath14 .",
    "the resulted sum of the diagrams is given by @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the correction to the propagator of a quasi - particle carrying momentum @xmath132 .",
    "the energy of a particle can be defined as the singularity of its propagator and readily obtained by solving the following equation @xmath133 the energy gap is defined as the lowest energy of excitation , which is numerically calculated and shown in fig.[fig - gap ] .",
    "the second order correction amounts to about @xmath134 of the corrected energy gap itself at the symmetric point @xmath0 . in fig.[fig - sz - j2 ] , we also plot the ordered moment @xmath58 as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "again , the moment is reduced by a small second - order correction . at the symmetric point ,",
    "the effective field is still larger than the critical value @xmath135 below which an ordered moment along @xmath9 direction becomes possible .",
    "we thus conclude that the mean - field results are robust against the second order perturbation .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the compass model can be mapped to a fermion model with local density interaction . through a self - consistent solution of the model",
    ", we argue that there is a first order phase transition at the symmetric point @xmath0 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with spin - wave analysis and recent numeric computations of the spectrum @xcite . in our approach , the most important fluctuation , namely the fluctuations along the weak coupling direction ,",
