    "in the present paper we will consider the relation between the deep inelastic structure function @xmath7 and the gluon density @xmath8 in the region of small @xmath2 . at very small",
    "@xmath2 the main contribution to @xmath9 comes from the sea quarks and the value of dis cross section is given by the photon - gluon fusion subprocess fig .",
    "1 . for large @xmath10 in the leading log @xmath10 approximation ( ll@xmath11a ) and in a physical ( say , axial ) gauge it is enough to deal only with the diagram fig .",
    "however within the llog(@xmath12)a , which sums up all the terms of the type @xmath13 , one has to take into account the graph fig .",
    "1b also .    based on these graphs fig",
    ". 1 one can extract the value of the gluon structure function @xmath14 from the experiment , where the dis structure function @xmath7 was measured .",
    "the question we are going to discuss here in more detail is : what are the values of gluon kinematical variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 which correspond to the arguments @xmath17 and @xmath10 of the dis cross section ; i.e.@xmath9 ?    in sect .",
    "2 we will remind the ll@xmath18a formulae @xcite for the function @xmath9 ( and @xmath19 ) written in the framework of the high energy @xmath20-factorization scheme @xcite , where the gluon @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is off mass - shell .    then by the numerical computation in sect .",
    "3 we will study the ratios of the deep inelastic ( bjorken ) variables ( @xmath22 and @xmath10 ) and the values of the gluon s momenta ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspondingly ) , which are essential in the integrals of eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 13 ) ; and how do these ratios depend on the form of the gluon structure function .    to answer the last question we parametrize the gluon density by the power functions - @xmath23 and",
    "plot the logarithms of the ratios @xmath24 as the functions of powers @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "even in the case of a strong scaling violation ( @xmath27 ) the average value @xmath28 turns out to be rather large .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath29 gev@xmath5 for @xmath30 gev@xmath5 .",
    "thus there appears a danger that an important part of @xmath7 is originated from the region of a small gluon s transverse momentum ( virtualities ) ( @xmath31 gev ) , where the perturbative qcd approach is not justified .    to follow the role of the infrared ( small @xmath32 ) region we have changed also the mass of a light quark",
    "was discussed in the previous paper [ 1].].the value of @xmath9 increases up to the factor of @xmath33 when instead of the constituent mass @xmath34 mev one puts the small ( close to the current ) mass @xmath35 mev . the situation becomes slightly better if we assume the saturation of gluon distributions at small @xmath2 and @xmath16 .    at very small @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath16 the cross section @xmath36 should tend to a constant .",
    "thus at @xmath37 ( for example we put here @xmath38 gev@xmath5 ) the gluon density @xmath39 ; in other words at @xmath40 the anomalous dimension @xmath41 . in this case the rapid decrease of @xmath14 at @xmath42 suppresses the role of the infrared region and the result becomes more stable ( under the variation of @xmath43 ) .",
    "this point will be discussed also in sect .",
    "3 .    finally we have to stress that the infrared ( @xmath44 gev ) region gives not too small contribution to the @xmath45 ratio and one has to remember about it , trying to extract the gluon structure function from the @xmath7 experimental data .",
    "the cross section of heavy quarks as well as light quarks ( if @xmath10 value is large enough ) electroproduction is given schematically by the graphs in fig .",
    "the main contribution to the cross section at small @xmath2 is known to come from gluons .",
    "the lower ladder blocks presents the two - dimensional gluon distribution @xmath46 which is a function of the fraction @xmath2 of the longitudinal momentum of the initial hadron and the gluon virtuality .",
    "its distribution over @xmath2 and transverse momenta @xmath47 in hadron is given in the semihard theory @xcite by function @xmath46 .",
    "it differs from the usual gluon structure function @xmath48 : @xmath49 such definition of @xmath46 makes possible to treat correctly the effects arising from gluons virtualities . the exact expression for this function",
    "can be obtained as a solution of the evolution equation which , contrary to the parton model case , is nonlinear due to interactions between the partons in small @xmath2 region .    in what follows we use sudakov decomposition for the produced quarks momenta @xmath50 through the light - like momenta of colliding particles @xmath51 and @xmath52 and transverse ones @xmath53 : @xmath54 the differential cross sections of a quark pair electroproduction",
    "denotes the virtual photon - proton transverse and longitudinal cross sections . ]",
    "have the form to be equal to gluon virtuality , which is very close to the blm scheme@xcite;(see also @xcite ) . ] : @xmath55 @xmath56 here @xmath57 , @xmath21 is the gluon transverse momentum and @xmath58 is the quarks rapidity in the @xmath59 c.m.s .",
    "frames , @xmath60 @xmath61 are the squares of the matrix elements@xcite for the cases of transverse and longitudinal electroproduction , respectively .    in lla kinematic @xmath62 so @xmath63 ( the more accurate relation is @xmath64 but we are working in the kinematics where @xmath65 ) .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath66 are calculated in the born order of qcd without standart simplifications of the parton model since in the small @xmath2 domain there are no grounds for neglecting the transverse momenta of the gluon @xmath67 in comparison with the quark masses and transverse momenta , especially in the case of light quark pair production . in the axial gauge @xmath68 the gluon propagator takes the form @xmath69 @xmath70 for the gluons in @xmath71-channel the main contribution comes from the so called nonsense polarization @xmath72 , which can be picked out by decomposing the numerator into longitudinal and transverse parts : @xmath73",
    "the other contributions are suppressed by the powers of @xmath74 . since the sum of the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 are gauge invariant in the lla , the transversality condition for the ends of gluon line enables one to replace @xmath75 by @xmath76 in expression for @xmath72 .",
    "thus we get @xmath77 or @xmath78 if we do such a trick for vector @xmath79 too .",
    "both these equations for @xmath80 can be used but for the form ( [ trans1 ] ) one has to modify the gluon vertex slightly ( to account for several ways of gluon emission ",
    "@xmath81.\\ ] ] as a result the colliding gluons can be treated as aligned ones and their polarization vectors are directed along the transverse momenta .",
    "ultimately , the nontrivial azimuthal correlations must arise between the transverse momenta @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the produced quarks .    in the case of photoproduction the alignment of the gluon",
    "makes the distribution of the difference of the transverse momenta of the quarks @xmath84 to be proportional to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the angle between the vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "although the situation considered here seems to be quite opposite to the parton model there is a certain limit in which our formulae can be transformed into parton model ones .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath89 collisions and assume now that the characteristic values of quarks momenta @xmath82 and @xmath83 are many times larger than the values of gluons momenta , @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath92 and one can keep only lowest powers of @xmath93 .",
    "it means that we can put @xmath94 everywhere in the matrix element @xmath66 except the vertices , as it was done in the parton model approach .    on the other hand ,",
    "the used assumption ( [ par1 ] ) is not fulfilled in a more or less realistic case .",
    "the transverse momenta of produced light quarks should be of the order of gluon virtualities ( qcd scale values ) .",
    "the function @xmath95 is unknown at small values of @xmath16",
    ". therefore we rewrite the integrals over @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ sel ] ) in the form @xmath97",
    "@xmath98 @xmath99 where eq .",
    "( [ xg ] ) is used .    using eq .",
    "( [ sel ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) we perform the numerical calculation of light quark production .",
    "the results of computations are presented in figs .",
    "2 - 8 . in figs . 2 and 3",
    "we plot the values of @xmath7 coming from the sea @xmath100 quark contribution in the cases of mt(s - dis ) @xcite and grv ho @xcite gluon distributions , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) which separates the region of small and large gluon momenta @xmath20 was chosen to be equal to 1 gev ( figs .",
    "2a and 3a ) and 2 gev ( figs . 2b and 3b ) .",
    "it is seen that the results depend rather strongly on the value of @xmath101 as well as on the mass of light quark and in both cases are differed from the original mt(s - dis ) ( or grv ho ) predictions for @xmath100 sea quark contribution ( which , in our notations correspond to @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) and shown by solid curves in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "however the difference of our calculated @xmath7 values and the original ones is not large .",
    "it means that both the procedure of the gluon density extraction from @xmath7 experimental data and the accuracy of our calculations are reasonably enough and there is no a large contribution of any ( say , nonperturbative ) corrections .    the only explanations is the contribution of the small transverse momenta @xmath104 and @xmath105 to the final value of @xmath9 .",
    "even for @xmath106 the difference between the cases of @xmath107 mev and 100 mev is of about 20% ( up to 30% for grv ho and @xmath108 ) at @xmath109 .    to understand better what are the typical quark ( @xmath32 ) and gluon ( @xmath110 ) momenta , which are essential in the integrals eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we have chose the parametrization of gluon distribution in the form @xmath111 and calculated the mean values of logarithms @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the advantage of the logarithms is that they does not destroy the main power structure of the integrand ( trying to estimate directly the value of @xmath115 or @xmath116 , one faces the divergence of the integral over @xmath117 at large ( small ) @xmath118 for the positive @xmath119 ) .",
    "the ratio of the sea @xmath120-quark to the gluon densities are given in fig .",
    "4 ( in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 structure functions ) for different values of @xmath26 ( 0.2 and 0.5 ) and @xmath25 ( 0.2 and 0.5 ) in eq . ( 14 ) . at very small @xmath121",
    "this ratio tends to a constant and does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "however , even at large @xmath122 ( the value which corresponds to the asymptotics ( extremum ) of the bfkl solution ) when from the formal point of view the convergence of the integral in the infrared region should be good enough , the dependence of the result on the light quark mass is still not negligible ( @xmath12320% difference between the values of @xmath9 for @xmath43 = 350 mev and 10 mev at @xmath124 and @xmath10 = 16 gev@xmath5 ) .",
    "the situation becomes slightly better ( see fig .",
    "5 ) if one assumes that for small @xmath10 the gluon density falls down as @xmath125 ( say , @xmath26 = 1 for @xmath126 1 gev@xmath5 ) .",
    "such a behaviour one might expect in the case of the gluon density saturation @xcite ( i.e. @xmath127 at @xmath128 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the saturation hypothesis is also not enough to neglect completely the small @xmath32 contribution . increasing the quark mass from 10 mev to 350 mev one diminishs the cross section more than 15% ( for example , at @xmath129 = 16 gev@xmath5 , @xmath130 ; and 20% for @xmath131 , without the saturation ) .",
    "this fact is confirmed by the @xmath26-dependence of the function @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "7a ) . as it should be expected the value of @xmath132 depends slowly on @xmath25 but noticiably increases with @xmath26 . for a more heavy photon",
    "( @xmath10 = 64 gev@xmath5 ) @xmath132 becomes smaller .",
    "it means that the typical values of @xmath118 increases with @xmath10 not as quickly as @xmath10 ( more close to @xmath133 ) . in the best case ( @xmath130 for @xmath134 1 gev@xmath5 and @xmath135 for @xmath126 1 gev@xmath5 ) the value of @xmath132 ( @xmath136 at @xmath10 = 16 gev@xmath5 ) corresponds to @xmath137 , essential in the integral , of about 3 gev@xmath5 ( smaller than the usual cutoff @xmath138 gev@xmath5 for the mt or msr parametrizations @xcite of the structure functions ) . without the saturation at @xmath10 = 16 gev@xmath5 the @xmath139 ; i.e. typical @xmath140 0.8 gev@xmath5 .    in order to estimate the values of the longitudinal gluon momenta ( @xmath15 )",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "8 the logarithms of the @xmath22 to @xmath15 ratios .",
    "the last ratios increase with @xmath10 as for a small @xmath10 the transverse momenta of quarks sometimes becomes larger than the photon virtuality ( @xmath133 ) , see fig .",
    "6 , and one needs a large @xmath15 of gluon to put these quarks on mass shell . in the region of @xmath141 16",
    "gev@xmath5 the value @xmath142 ; it means that as an average the gluon @xmath15 is 3 times larger than the bjorken @xmath22 .",
    "this result slightly differs from the prytz estimation @xcite where a gluon has @xmath143 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is the sum of transverse ( @xmath144 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath145 ) contributions .",
    "as one can see from the table , at large @xmath10 the last contribution is more ifrared stable .",
    "we hope that the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath8 presented in figs .",
    "4 , 5 as a functions of anomalous dimention @xmath26 and intercept @xmath25 may be used in future in order to extract , for example , the values of gluon density directly from the @xmath9 structure function ( in this case the values of @xmath26 and @xmath25 are also come from the @xmath9 data as @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the results we have presented here are close to the standard gluon densities extracted from the derivative @xmath148 ( using the prytz method @xcite , or the modified one , taken into account the nlo corrections @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , here we better understand the typical values of gluon momenta we deal with and can control the role of the small @xmath47 ( infrared ) region .",
    "the mean logarithms @xmath149 and @xmath150 give us an estimate of the quark transverse momenta which are essential in the process , and the values of gluon virtuality ( @xmath16 ) and proton momentum fraction ( @xmath15 ) which correspond to the point @xmath22 and @xmath10 for the structure function @xmath9",
    ".    a lesson one has to extract from these calculations is the fact that an essential values of transverse momenta ( @xmath32 ) which do contribute to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections may be quite differ from the initial @xmath10 . at not too large @xmath10 the value of @xmath151 may be even larger than @xmath10 ( in fig .",
    "6 @xmath152 for @xmath153 16 gev@xmath5 .",
    "however the main danger comes from the cases where the virtuality in the internal loops is much smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "for example when ( as it was done in @xcite ) one includes in the anomalous dimension @xmath154 the nlo corrections of the type @xmath155 in the first non - zero ( 4-loops ) gluon - gluon correction @xmath156 , he touches the region of the internal @xmath157 ; down to @xmath158 due to the large numerical coefficient @xmath159 in the lipatov @xcite diffusion - like distribution @xmath160 = \\exp[-\\ln^2(q^2/q^2)/(a\\cdot n)]$ ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 is the number of loops .",
    "after this we use the value of the anomalous dimension @xmath154 ( including the nlo corrections ) as a local ( from the point of view of @xmath163 space ) contribution at the given point @xmath10 .",
    "there are no problems if @xmath10 is very large but one can not to do this for not too large @xmath10 where the essential transverse momenta of intermidiate gluons may be rather small : close to the infrared region ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "2 . @xmath166 sea quark contributions to @xmath7 as given by mt s - dis @xcite sea quark distributions ( solid curves ) and our calculations using mt s - dis gluon distributions for @xmath43 = 10 mev and 100 mev ( dashed and dash - dotted curves , respectively ) .",
    "the values of @xmath101 parameter equal to 1 gev ( a ) and 2 gev ( b ) were used in eq .",
