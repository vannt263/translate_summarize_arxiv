    "heavy quark production in hadronic collisions is one of the most interesting testing grounds of quantum chromodinamics . the fusion reactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 are expected to be dominant in heavy quark , @xmath4 , production and , as a matter of fact experimental data seems to reasonably agree with perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations which today are available up to next to leading order ( nlo )  @xcite .",
    "once a heavy quark is produced , it has to hadronize to produce the observed , hadronic , final state . on this respect ,",
    "it was expected that the factorization theorem be valid and hadronization proceeded through the fragmentation mechanism .",
    "thus , heavy hadron production can be separated into the perturbatively calculable hard scattering and gluon dynamics from the non - perturbative bound state dynamics contained in the process independent hadron structure , expresed through the corresponding parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the jet fragmentation functions , @xmath7   is the momentum fraction of partons inside the initial hadron , @xmath8 is the momentum fraction of the heavy quark in the final hadron .",
    "@xmath9 is the momentum transfer . ] .",
    "literally speaking , the factorization assumption predicts strict independence of the heavy quark hadronization from the production process .",
    "thus , no flavor correlation should exist between initial and final states",
    ".    however , there exist copiuos experimental information on charm hadron production which contradicts the above hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there was observed an excess in the charm hadron production at large values of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and a correlation between the leading charm hadrons with the projectile quantum numbers .",
    "this suggests the presence of other hadronization mechanisms which must be relevant at large values of @xmath10 and low @xmath12 , as long as fragmentation of the charm quark should not produce either flavor correlations between initial and final states , neither charm hadrons at large values of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , flavor correlation suggests hadronization mechanims by which projetile spectators produced at small @xmath12 recombine with charm quarks produced either perturbatively in the hard qcd process , or charm quarks , though perhaps of a non - perturbative nature , already present in the structure of the beam particles .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", models have been proposed to account for the enhancement of charm hadron production at large @xmath10 and flavor correlations . among them",
    "we can mention the model of ref  @xcite , in which a charm quark produced perturbatively recombines with the debris of the projectile , the intrinsic charm model  @xcite , in which a particular fock state of the projectile containing charm quarks breaks in the collision giving thus the desired flavor correlation between initial and final particles , recombination type models  @xcite in which charm quarks already present in the projectile structure recombine with light quarks , and models based in the dual parton model and dual topological unitarization  @xcite in which both , the heavy quark production and hadronization , are treated on a non - perturbative basis .",
    "likewise , most recently two new approachs based in recombination have been presented . in the first , recombination of charm and light quarks , both being part of a hard qcd diagram ,",
    "recombine to produce a charm hadron  @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", recombination is thought as a higher order correction to hadronization since hard scattering diagrams contributing to this process are of nlo or higher .",
    "the second approach  @xcite involves a modification of the usual recombination prescription to produce an enhancement in the central ( low @xmath10 ) production of charm hadrons .",
    "all the above models have been more or less successful in reproducing the main features of charm hadron production , with possibly the only exception of the intrinsic charm model  @xcite , which seems to be excluded  @xcite by recent experimental data on charm baryon production in @xmath13 interactions by the e791  @xcite and selex  @xcite collaborations",
    ". however , it is important to remark that , although some models are able to reproduce experimental data on production asymmetries , they can not reproduce simultaneously data on production asymmetries and differential cross sections .",
    "this is the case of the intrinsic charm model , as noted in ref .",
    "this shows that in order to make a meaningful comparison among models and experimental data , both , the differential cross section and the production asymmetry have to be taken properly into account . as a matter of fact , we have two out of three quantities which are independent , namely , the differential cross sections of both , particle and antiparticle , or one of the cross sections and the production asymmetry .    in",
    "what follows we shall analyse the main features of perturbative charm production in hadron - hadron collisions followed by the study of possible hadronization mechanisms .",
    "later , we will compare model results with available experimental data .",
    "the last section will be devoted to conclusions .",
    "in the parton model , charm quarks are produced through the interaction of partons in the initial hadrons .",
    "the differential cross section as a function of @xmath10 is given by  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a function containing information on the structure of the colliding hadrons @xmath16 , and on the hard qcd process which produces the charm quarks . at lo ,",
    "the funtion @xmath15 reads @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the parton momentum fractions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the quark and gluon momentum distributions in the colliding particles , @xmath22 is the square of c.m .",

    "( [ 1.2 ] ) runs over @xmath30 .    the elementary cross - sections for @xmath31 anihilation and gluon fusion , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , at lo are given by  @xcite .",

    "the feynman diagrams involved in the calculation of eqs .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) and ( [ 1.4 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.3]-[1.4 ] ) , at lo the only dependence on @xmath24 in the elementary cross sections is in @xmath39 . at this order ,",
    "the value of the renormalization scale is fixed by the requirement that the propagators in diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] be off - shell by a quantity of at least @xmath40 .",
    "so , it is common to use @xmath41 .    concerning the factorization scale @xmath23 , it is the scale at which the initial hadrons `` see '' one another in the collision",
    ". then , in the above sense , @xmath23 gives the quark and gluon content of the initial hadrons at the time of the collision .",
    "however , differently to the case of the renormalization scale @xmath24 , there is no guiding principle to help fixing @xmath23 . along this work , and in order to avoid problems related with flavor excitation diagrams containing heavy quarks  @xcite , we shall use @xmath42 gev , below the threshold for charm production and consistent with the sum over light flavors in eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "it is also known that nlo and lo calculations only differ by a @xmath43-factor of the order of @xmath44  @xcite , meaning that calculations can be done consistently at lo and then multiplied by the corresponding @xmath43-factor .",
    "nlo calculations also show a tiny @xmath45 asymmetry  @xcite , which is too small to produce any effect after hadronization .",
    "note however that , although the small @xmath45 asymmetry arising at nlo has the same sign that the observed @xmath46 production asymmetry ( i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 favored over @xmath26 and @xmath49 production ) , it has the opposite sign for baryon production .",
    "there are basically two different models for charm quark hadronization , namely , recombination and fragmentation . in the first ,",
    "the @xmath50-quark produced in a pqcd process joints to the debris of the initial particles to form the final charm hadron  @xcite while in the second , the @xmath50-quark fragments to the final charm hadron leaving a string of quarks behind it  @xcite .",
    "variation of these processes can also be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , there are some features which are common to any class of hadronization processes : hadrons are colorless , which means that hadronizing quarks must be in a color singlet state and , at the end of hadronization , no free quarks could exist any more .",
    "these two basic requirements are the consequence of confinement in qcd . consequently ,",
    "whatever the hadronization process be , a color string must be formed among the hadronizing quarks which has to have the correct color quantum numbers and the exact number of quarks to ensure that no free quarks remain at the end of the process and colorless hadrons are formed .",
    "these lead us to the following clasification : _",
    "i ) short color strings _ , responsible for recombination processes , in which a @xmath51 pair or a @xmath52 forms the final hadron without further hadron emission , and _",
    "ii ) large color strings _ , producing the final hadron by fragmentation being it accompanied by the emission of light ( mostly pion ) mesons .",
    "note that , in addition , for each case there exist also two different types of color strings , namely , the meson and the baryon - like strings , being them characterized by the fact that the first is formed among a quark and an antiquark and the second one between a quark and a diquark , as shown in fig .",
    "the first will produce predominantly mesons while the later has to produce at least one baryon in order to conserve the baryon number .    in what follows , we will analyze both , fragmentation and recombination , having in mind their applicability to heavy quark hadronization process .",
    "a typical quark configuration leading to fragmentation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "formation of color strings among the charm quarks and the remnants of the colliding hadrons would give rise to the production of open charm , i.e. @xmath53 mesons and eventually charm baryons .",
    "this kind of contribution to hadronization is usually modeled by the convolution of the @xmath26-quark differential cross section with a peterson fragmentation function , @xmath54 , @xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is given in eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) . along this work",
    "we will use @xmath57 for @xmath53 meson production and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "these values for @xmath60 have been extracted from charm hadron production in @xmath61 interactions  @xcite .",
    "note that the fragmentation function is used to model the production of a hadron containing a heavy quark at the end of the color string , regardless of what happens with the remaining of the color string .",
    "a typical quark configuration leading to recombination is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the contribution of the recombination mechanism can be estimated by means of  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the recombination function , for which we shall use  @xcite @xmath64 with @xmath65 a normalization parameter which has to be fixed from experimental data . in eq .",

    "( [ 3.3 ] ) by  @xcite @xmath76 notice that , as the quark @xmath70 contains information about the structure of one of the colliding hadrons , this introduces a flavor correlation among the initial and final states .",
    "a second possibility is that a _ spectator _ charm quark in a flavor excitation subdiagram recombines with the debris of one of the initial hadrons as shown in fig .",
    "this kind of contributions can be calculated along the lines of the model of refs .",
    "@xcite in which a charm quark being part of the sea of the initial hadron recombines with valence and sea quarks after the collision .",
    "notice , however , that the factorization scale must be consistent with the fact that charm quarks exist in the sea of the initial hadron , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "the production of charm mesons is then given by  @xcite    @xmath78    where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , is the momentum fraction of the @xmath81 quark , @xmath82 is the two - quark distribution function in the initial hadron and @xmath83 is the two - quark recombination function with @xmath65 a normalization constant which must be fixed by comparison to experimental data .",
    "baryon production can be calculated just by replacing the @xmath84 and @xmath85 by the corresponding functions for three quark recombination . along this work",

    "( [ comp1 ] ) accounts for charm hadron production through fragmentation and its expression is given in eqs .",

    "in recombination , the asymmetry is a consequence of the sharing of partons among the initial and final particles . in fragmentation , the asymmetry is due to the parton content of the initial particles .",
