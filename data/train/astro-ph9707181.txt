    "one of the most interesting and controversial discoveries in the field of galaxy formation and evolution is related to the excess number count of faint blue objects ( see for example koo 1996 or ellis 1997 for a review ) .",
    "various evolutionary models favour a scenario in which massive galaxies form stars at high redshifts ( @xmath8 23 ) , while low - mass systems ( dwarfs ) experience an initial and disruptive starburst much later and contribute significantly to the faint blue objects counts ( corbelli @xmath9 salpeter 1995 , hereafter cs ; ferguson & mcgaug 1995 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ; gwyn @xmath9 hartwick 1996 ; cowie et al . 1997 ; guzman et al .",
    "the delayed star formation in dwarf galaxies has been explained as a consequence of the delayed recombination of ionized hydrogen ( babul & rees 1992 ; efstathiou 1992 ) and of the late onset of the gravitational instability which , in low mass systems , takes place only when the temperature drops well below @xmath1 k ( babul & rees  1993 , cs ) .",
    "cooling below @xmath1  k can be caused by a slow build - up of metals , due to some sporadic star formation events before the onset of the large scale starburst ( cs ) .",
    "however , since the metal abundance required for efficient cooling increases as the column density of protodisks decreases , it is likely that additional processes must regulate the cooling in systems which are at lower end of the gas surface density distribution . in this letter",
    "we examine if the formation of molecular hydrogen can provide such cooling in gaseous disks .",
    "the role of molecular coolants has been investigated in various cosmological contexts , such as the collapse and fragmentation of jeans unstable clouds , pregalactic shocks and galaxy formation models ( shapiro & kang 1987 ; vietri & pesce 1995 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; haiman et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; anninos & norman  1996 ; tegmark et al . 1997 ; kepner et al .",
    "all these studies have emphasized the importance of molecular hydrogen as the major agent to drive the temperature of the gas well below @xmath1  k. the ability of h@xmath10 to form in sufficient amount depends critically on the shielding of the gas to the background ionizing and dissociating radiation . here , we study the evolution of the central regions of a protogalactic disk which at some redshift are warm and in thermal equilibrium with an external radiation field . we show that , as the radiation field decreases with time , the formation of a small concentration of h@xmath10 drives the gas out of equilibrium causing a rapid transition of the gas from the warm to the cold phase at a critical redshift @xmath11 .",
    "the consequent reduction of thermal support can cause a gravitational instability of the disk and we examine which are the most favorable conditions for this to happen .",
    "we consider low gas surface density proto - disks ( lsps ) embedded in a spherical dark matter halo and rotationally supported against gravitational collapse . similarly to what is today the disk of a low - surface brightness galaxy ( de blok et al .",
    "1996 ) , lsps are expected to have slowly rising rotation curves , with lower asymptotic values , @xmath12 , and shallower gas radial distributions compared to disks with higher gas surface density .",
    "we concentrate on the central regions of lsps at @xmath13 , with @xmath14 in the range 38 kpc , where we can consider the dark matter density and the gas column density as radially constant . here",
    "the column density of neutral hydrogen ( which is by far the dominant species ) is typically in the range @xmath3 @xmath4 , and the corresponding gas masses inside @xmath14 are between @xmath15@xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "the dark matter determines the value of @xmath12 ; for @xmath18150  km  s@xmath19 the total mass inside @xmath14 is @xmath20@xmath21  @xmath17 .",
    "disks with such characteristics are expected to exist already at @xmath22 , as shown by the theoretical calculations by kauffmann  ( 1996 ) and by observations of damped ly@xmath23 systems ( wolfe et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "after recombination the vertical gas distribution is nearly isothermal , in hydrostatic equilibrium at each radius .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that the gas stays quite uniform in temperature for most of the time and therefore in this letter we do not consider explicitly its vertical stratification .",
    "we approximate the total gas pressure with its value at midplane as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath26 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the two terms in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) represent the contributions of the gas self - gravity and the dark matter , respectively .",
    "the pressure is radially constant in the central region and changes with time as the slab cools due to the temperature dependence of @xmath26 , which we follow explicitly .",
    "the chemistry of h@xmath10 depends upon the density of free electrons and therefore on the ionizing flux at energies @xmath27  ev , able to penetrate column densities @xmath28  @xmath4 , as well as on the uv flux below the lyman limit . at redshifts @xmath29 ,",
    "the quasar background decreases with time and accounts for most of the ionizing flux ( irwin , mcmahon , & hazard 1991 ) .",
    "we shall use the following fit to the results of haardt & madau  ( 1996 ) at @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is in ev , and @xmath33 in erg  s@xmath19  @xmath4  sr@xmath19  hz@xmath19 . for the haardt & madau  ( 1996 ) spectrum , @xmath34 which defines our _ standard _ flux spectrum .",
    "we consider variations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 to account for uncertainties in the intrinsic emission spectrum of quasars , in the attenuation by intervening clouds , and in additional uv radiation from nearby bright star - forming galaxies or from sporadic internal star formation .",
    "we have followed the evolution of @xmath37 , h , h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 and h@xmath10 by means of a reduced chemical network which includes the most relevant reactions listed in table  1 .",
    "we have also considered the h@xmath40 channel for h@xmath10 formation , but its contribution was found to be negligible . since temperatures of interest in this paper are below @xmath1  k , secondary electrons from h and he have been included following the prescription of shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) .",
    "these electrons tend to level the difference between he and h fractional ionization deriving from direct photoionization alone .",
    "thus , the residual abundance of he@xmath38 is set equal to that of h@xmath38 . for the photoionization rates we have integrated the cross sections given in the references listed in table 1 over the background spectrum .",
    "we account for the attenuation of the flux as it penetrates the slab to the midplane assuming that the density of the chemical species is uniform .",
    "the recombination coefficient for hydrogen includes all the recombinations to @xmath41 ( on the spot approximation ) and we assume that all the recombinations of he produce one ionizing photon for h. the line - shielding of h@xmath10 molecules in the ground level has been computed using the prescriptions of federman et al . ( 1979 ) in the absence of dust grains .",
    "the photodissociation probabilities and oscillator strengths for lyman and werner bands are from dalgarno & stephens ( 1970 ) and abgrall & roueff ( 1989 ) .",
    "the thermal evolution of the gas is computed by solving the energy equation together with the chemical network ( we have used a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 ) .",
    "heating of the gas is provided by photoionization of atomic h and he ( shull @xmath9 van steenberg 1985 ) .",
    "cooling is due to electron - impact excitation of atomic h ( spitzer 1978 ) and to h - impact excitation of roto - vibrational levels of h@xmath10 ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 , but with the correct sign as in flower et al . 1986 ) .",
    "we have neglected the contribution of h@xmath10-h@xmath10 collisions to the cooling because of the small molecular abundance .",
    "for a given value of @xmath42 the gas temperature of a slab in thermal equilibrium depends on the intensity of the background field and on the gas column density of the slab . for the standard background spectrum fig .",
    "1a ( curves 1 and 2 ) shows the possible equilibrium temperatures , after the gas has recombined , as function of redshift for two representative values of @xmath43 .",
    "we see from fig .  1a that conditions for a multiphase medium , in which gas at different temperatures coexists in pressure balance , can be achieved over a significant range of redshift .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in the present - day interstellar medium ( field et .",
    "al 1969 ) , where metal lines radiation rather than @xmath44 dominates the cooling . in general",
    "a multiphase medium is possible if for a given pressure the cooling per atom is a non monotonic function of @xmath45 . in the present context at @xmath46",
    "k the cooling rate is an increasing function of @xmath45 since the dominant process is the e - h impact excitation . below 7000  k",
    ", @xmath47 impact excitation becomes the relevant cooling process : h@xmath10 is formed efficiently by reaction ( 3 ) and is destroyed by reaction ( 5 ) . the strong temperature dependence of reaction ( 5 ) ,",
    "proportional to @xmath48 , allows a rapid rise of the h@xmath10 fractional abundance as the temperature diminishes . due to the weak temperature dependence of the @xmath44 cooling function in this region",
    ", cooling per particle becomes a decreasing function of @xmath45 and the equilibrium curve has an inflection .",
    "this is a thermally unstable regime which ends at @xmath49  k , when the 2-step photodissociation takes over reaction ( 5 ) ( direct dissociation by hard photons , reaction 8 , never contributes significantly to the h@xmath10 balance ) .",
    "under some circumstances it may not be obvious to determine the dominat thermal phase if , for a given ionizing flux , three equilibrium temperatures are possible . for the warm slab considered here the temperature evolution is much simpler : as the background flux declines with time , the temperature decreases monotonically from @xmath50  k moving along the equilibrium curve towards the right hand side of fig ..  1a .",
    "the non monotonic relation @xmath51 ) implies that at a certain redshift @xmath11 the gas reaches the lowest stable equilibrium temperature in the warm phase : we shall call this _ transition point _ ( marked by an asterisk in fig .",
    "1 ) . for a slab of typical column density",
    "@xmath52 @xmath4 @xmath11 is @xmath53 .",
    "the gas is thereafter forced to get out of equilibrium .",
    "the dashed tracks of figure 1a show the subsequent time evolution of @xmath45 computed for a parcel of gas close to the midplane .",
    "we can see that the gas cools quickly toward the cold stable phase spending a very short interval of time at temperatures between 7000  k and 200  k. the transition towards the cold phase propagates rapidly vertically since the upper layers loose thermal support and settle towards the center incresing their density and cooling further .",
    "due to the rapid cooling , shortly after the cold core forms most of the gas will be at close temperatures and the warm atmosphere left above contains little mass . during the transition the fractional abundance of h@xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath54(h@xmath10 ) , increases from @xmath55 to @xmath56 and then levels off ( fig .",
    "the final value of @xmath54(h@xmath10 ) is not very sensitive to either the background flux or the gas column density .",
    "lsps with @xmath43 column density between 10@xmath57 and 10@xmath58 @xmath4 make a transition to the cold phase in the redshift interval @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 can vary appreciably with the intensity of the background flux . from curve 3 of fig .",
    "1@xmath61 we can see in fact that as @xmath35 increases , cooling of the slab is delayed until a much lower @xmath62 .",
    "we have examined cases with @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the important point is that there is always a range of column densities between @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath4 which make the transition to the cold phase in the redshift interval @xmath602 .",
    "this conclusion holds even if a small amount of metals ( up to 0.01 solar ) is present in the gas mixture as a contamination from an early generation of stars .",
    "therefore , for the central regions of lsps , molecular hydrogen plays a fundamental role in promoting and driving the thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "protodisks exposed to a time - varying external radiation field follow the evolution described in the previous section if they are still gaseous and gravitationally stable in the warm phase .",
    "we examine the global gravitational stability of the simple hydrostatic model described in sect .",
    "2 using the toomre criterion ( toomre  1964 ; see also cs ) . for @xmath67",
    "the parameter @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 to evaluate the contribution of the self - gravity term we have used eq .",
    "( 25 ) of toomre ( 1963 ) assuming that the protogalaxy has a total gas mass @xmath70 m@xmath71 .",
    "this guarantees a radially constant gas surface density for @xmath67 and a slowly rising rotation curve with @xmath72 determined by the amount of dark matter .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath43 , we can derive @xmath68 as function of redshift .",
    "we are interested in all the disk models which are stable in the warm phase but become unstable ( @xmath73 ) only at @xmath74 due to the decrease of the isothermal sound speed driven by h@xmath10 cooling .",
    "these galaxies will experience a delay in the onset of large scale star formation .",
    "a comprehensive view of the stability and dominant thermal phases of the gas in the plane @xmath75 for the standard background spectrum is given in figure  2 . in the region labelled _",
    "cold @xmath9 unstable _ slabs which are stable for @xmath74 become gravitationally unstable before @xmath60 .",
    "lsps in this region span a considerable range of column densities below @xmath76 @xmath4 .",
    "models in the _",
    "warm @xmath9 unstable _ region have @xmath73 for @xmath77  k and the collapse starts as soon as the gas settles into the disk .",
    "the shaded regions in the left part of fig .",
    "2 show stable models which can be either cold or warm but can not form stars . for some of these slabs cooling of the gas did actually start , but the temperature was not low enough to trigger the instability before @xmath60 ( _ cold @xmath9 stable _ ) .",
    "since cold disks have not been observed , it is likely that lsps were never formed with these initial conditions ( very low @xmath43 and high @xmath42 values ) . finally , in the _",
    "warm @xmath9 stable _ region the gas remains warm up to @xmath60 ; here the parameters of the slabs are more appropriate for the outer regions of disk galaxies ( corbelli & salpeter 1993 )",
    ". outer regions of lsps and their central regions prior to @xmath11 might also contribute significantly to qso absorption lines ( see also linder 1997 ) because the time the gas spends in the warm phase at @xmath78  k is long compared to the transition time toward the cold and disruptive phase .",
    "the dotted lines in the _ cold @xmath9 unstable _ region of fig .",
    "2 represent the loci of @xmath79 and are labelled with the corresponding redshift ( the @xmath60 line coincides with the heavy solid line at the left hand side of this region ) .",
    "systems of increasingly lower column density start to cool and become unstable at lower and lower redshifts . for values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 higher than the standard case , the left border of the _ cold @xmath9 unstable _ region and the dotted lines shift to the right .",
    "if at some redshift slabs of higher @xmath43 had already become cold and unstable but the background flux intensity receives an extra input , the whole cooling process might stop .",
    "this can explain the lack of a large population of faint star forming disks of very low column density at @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , the observed deficit can also be due to a truncation of the distribution function of protodisks of low column densities .    how does the theoretical scheme of fig .",
    "2 compare with observations ?",
    "a precise answer to this question is difficult since the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath42 of protogalactic disks are unknown .",
    "however , as an illustration , we can use the results of de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) which are reminiscent of our models of lsps .",
    "we have estimated @xmath43 and @xmath42 for ten galaxies of their sample with slowly rising rotation curves , excluding lsbs with steeply declining gas column density profiles in the inner regions .",
    "the selected objects correspond to lsbs with @xmath80 arcsec and the results are shown by the filled triangles of fig .  2 .",
    "the data fall within the boundaries of the _ cold @xmath9 unstable _ region and indicate that if lsps were similar to lsbs they had the adequate parameters to follow the evolution described in this letter .",
    "within this region , systems of low column density and dynamical mass are those for which the ensuing starburst easily disrupts the gaseous central region and reduces considerably the gas mass content .",
    "thus , further star formation is inhibited and the systems experience a fading away phase ( cs ) .",
    "the identification of lsps with the progenitors of lsbs is quite appealing since some of the properties of the blue galaxies observed at moderate @xmath62 can be explained if these are edge - on manifestations of lsbs ( dalcanton & shectman 1996 ) .",
    "present - day lsbs might descend from those lsps which , for environmental effects or some internal feature ( higher dark matter or gas content ) , had a slower , and less violent star formation phase ."
