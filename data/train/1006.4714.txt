    "[ lemma poisson brackets of constraint functions ] the constraints ( [ constraint functions ] ) satisfy the dynamical poisson brackets @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75    the following variational derivatives of ( [ auxiliary constraint function ] ) will be needed : @xmath76 inserting ( [ constraint functions ] ) on the left hand side of ( [ poisson brackets of constraint functions 1 - 1 ] ) yields @xmath77 where we have used that @xmath78 using the definition of the poisson bracket , the variational derivatives ( [ variations of auxiliary constraint function ] ) , and integrating by parts gives @xmath79 applying ( [ integrability criterion ] ) to the expression within parenthesis in the last line above , together with the use of equations ( [ laplace of green s function ] ) and ( [ variations of auxiliary constraint function ] ) , leads to @xmath80 which proves ( [ poisson brackets of constraint functions 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the poisson bracket ( [ poisson brackets of constraint functions 2 - 2 ] ) is trivial since @xmath81 only involves the field @xmath82 .",
    "finally , ( [ poisson brackets of constraint functions 1 - 2 ] ) is easily proven using ( [ canonical poisson brackets ] ) , ( [ normalization of rho ] ) , and by noting that @xmath83 since @xmath84 does not contain @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we define a dirac bracket that turns the second class constraints ( [ constraint functions ] ) effectively first class . to this end",
    ", the canonical procedure would be to set @xmath85 and then define the dirac bracket by @xmath86 however , as it stands , this expression is not well defined since ( [ constraint matrix ] ) is not invertible . more specifically , by equation ( [ poisson brackets of constraint functions 1 - 2 ] ) in lemma [ lemma poisson brackets of constraint functions ] , one finds that @xmath87 defines a projection onto the space of zero - mean real - valued functions on @xmath27 : @xmath88(\\varphi ) : = \\int { \\chi ( \\varphi , \\tilde \\varphi ) f(\\tilde \\varphi ) d^m \\tilde \\varphi }   = f(\\varphi ) - \\bar f\\ ] ] with the mean of @xmath89 defined by @xmath90 it follows that @xmath91 is non - trivial , and ( [ constraint matrix ] ) is indeed non - invertible .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the bracket obtained by restricting ( [ chi ] ) to @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath93 , will be sufficient for our purposes .",

    "the jacobi identity is proven along the same lines as the original proof by dirac @xcite . to simplify the algebra , we first write ( [ alternative dirac bracket ] ) symbolically as @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104 denote cyclic permutation of 1 , 2 , 3 , and summation of the result , such that @xmath105 then @xmath106 the first two lines are zero by the jacobi identity for the poisson bracket . renaming dummy summation indices and again using the jacobi identity , the last line can be rewritten as @xmath107 by lemma [ lemma poisson brackets of constraint functions ] , this simplifies to @xmath108 when summing over indices .",
    "but this is zero since @xmath109 for functions @xmath110 of @xmath36 , @xmath51 , @xmath37 , and @xmath50 . to prove ( [ bracket between constraint and f ] ) , we first note that @xmath111 where , in the second equality , we have used that variations of @xmath84 ( [ variations of auxiliary constraint function ] ) depend explicitly on @xmath112 .",
    "analogous to ( [ vanishing integral of green function ] ) , all these terms vanish when one integrates with respect to @xmath113 above .",

    "the dirac brackets between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 coincide with the corresponding dynamical poisson brackets ( @xmath118 , etc . ) .",
