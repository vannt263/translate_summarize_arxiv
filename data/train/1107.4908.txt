    "<S> quantum interference in such a setup results in the suppression of the lower motional sideband , leading to strongly enhanced cooling in the non - sideband - resolved regime . with state - of - the - art parameters , </S>",
    "<S> ground - state cooling and low - power quantum - limited position transduction are both possible . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of a strong and tunable dissipative coupling opens up a new route towards observation of fundamental optomechanical effects such as ponderomotive squeezing or nonlinear dynamics . beyond optomechanics , </S>",
    "<S> the method suggested here can be readily transferred to other setups involving such systems as nonlinear media , atomic ensembles , or single atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in the engineering of high - quality micromechanical oscillators coupled to high - finesse cavity modes has paved the way towards sensing and control of mechanical motion at the quantum limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid developments in the field of optomechanics bear important implications for both applied and basic science , ranging from applications in high - sensitivity metrology  @xcite and quantum information processing  @xcite to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics at large mass- and length - scales  @xcite .    in the conventional paradigm of optomechanics the interaction of the mechanical oscillator with a cavity mode </S>",
    "<S> is _ dispersive _ in the sense that the cavity resonance frequency experiences a shift depending on the displacement of the mechanical oscillator arising from conservative radiation pressure or optical gradient forces . </S>",
    "<S> this coherent dispersive interaction has been employed for sideband - cooling to the quantum mechanical ground state  @xcite , as well as for the observation of optomechanical normal - mode splitting  @xcite and optomechanically - induced transparency  @xcite . the complementary paradigm of _ dissipative _ coupling  where the _ width _ @xmath0 of the cavity resonance , rather than its frequency @xmath1 , is dependent on the mechanical displacement @xmath2was introduced very recently in a theoretical study  @xcite in the context of electromechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this situation , rather unusual for cavity quantum electrodynamics , was shown  @xcite to give rise to remarkable quantum noise interference effects which dramatically relax requirements for cooling to the ground state without sideband resolution ; it also allows reaching the standard quantum limit ( sql ) for the imprecision in position measurements . </S>",
    "<S> while it is already clear that a strong and tunable dissipative optomechanical coupling would greatly enrich the toolbox of optomechanics , its full significance for the quantum control of optomechanical systems , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , for ponderomotive squeezing  @xcite , nonlinear dymanics  @xcite , or pulsed protocols  @xcite , is yet to be explored . </S>",
    "<S> + unfortunately , an optomechanical setup having a strong dissipative coupling in the absence of dispersive coupling has not been found . </S>",
    "<S> consider , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , a fabry  </S>",
    "<S> prot interferometer ( fpi ) of length @xmath3 and resonance frequency @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , with one movable ideal end - mirror and an input coupler of transmissivity @xmath6 , such that the cavity linewidth is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> when the mirror moves , the cavity length changes , and with it both @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding shifts per zero - point fluctuation @xmath8 of the mirror oscillator , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , quantify the strength of dispersive and dissipative couplings , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their ratio is thus given by the cavity s quality factor , @xmath11 , such that the dispersive coupling dominates by far . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion applies for a movable membrane coupled to a single mode of a fpi . </S>",
    "<S> one may obtain @xmath12 by coupling the membrane to multiple  @xcite transverse modes , such that _ both _ types of coupling contribute to the dynamics ; however in such a setup , one can not ` switch off ' the dispersive interaction to take advantage of the quantum noise interference effects present in a purely dissipative coupling .     </S>",
    "<S> depend on @xmath13 . ]    here we show that in a michelson - sagnac interferometer ( msi ) with a movable membrane  @xcite , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : physicalmodel ] , a strong and tunable optomechanical coupling can be achieved for which @xmath14 but where the effective _ dissipative _ coupling strength  @xcite can be of the order of the cavity linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is as follows : consider the msi operated at a point where the transmissivity @xmath6 of the effective mirror is close to zero ; @xmath6 will then depend sensitively on the membrane displacement @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> combining this compound ` msi - mirror ' with a perfect mirror in its dark port will result in an effective fpi whose linewidth depends on @xmath2 dominantly via @xmath6 and not via the change in the ( effective ) cavity length @xmath3 , see  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : physicalmodel ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a true fpi , therefore , @xmath15 and @xmath16 have a different functional dependence on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature gives rise to a topology ( i )  where the optomechanical interaction can be _ tuned at will _ between being strongly dissipative or dispersive , and ( ii )  which can realize dissipative optomechanics leading to _ ground - state cooling _ of the mechanical oscillator via quantum noise interference , as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distinctive signature of this interaction , an asymmetric fano lineshape , is observable in the spectrum of the cavity output field . </S>",
    "<S> we also report on the suitability of using this system for ( iii )  _ sensitive position transduction_.    this paper is structured as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we shall first describe the physical model and write down the resulting hamiltonian and input  output relation . </S>",
    "<S> these are then used to derive the equations of motion for the cavity field and oscillator motion . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dynamics is solved to obtain the steady - state mechanical occupation number analytically in the weak - coupling limit , and also numerically in both weak- and strong - coupling regimes . </S>"
