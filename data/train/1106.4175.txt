    "cavity polaritons are bound light - matter states that appear due to the strong coupling of 2d excitons and photons in semiconductor microcavities.@xcite the optically driven system of polaritons behaves like a weakly imperfect bose gas , which results in a spectacular row of polariton collective phenomena such as multistability,@xcite parametric scattering,@xcite pattern formation,@xcite self - organization effects,@xcite dynamical bose - einstein condensation.@xcite polariton multistability attracts much attention as a potential candidate for very fast picosecond range optical switching on a micron size scale.@xcite moreover , the sharp transitions in intra - cavity field , stemming from the multistability , can proceed concurrently with inter - mode parametric scattering , which determines interesting ways of polariton self - organization under pumping near the inflection point of the lower polariton branch ( the `` magic angle'').@xcite    the polariton bistability has recently been studied in the `` scalar '' approximation neglecting the spin degrees of freedom.@xcite because of the mutual interaction of polaritons , their energy effectively depends on the intra - cavity field magnitude .",
    "the repulsion between excitons leads to the blueshift of polariton energy .",
    "when the pump is itself blue - detuned from the polariton resonance , a strong positive feedback loop between the resonance energy and the field amplitude is created in a certain range of system parameters , resulting in sharp jumps in the intra - cavity field and , hence , in the cavity transmission .",
    "consequently , the transmission signal can exhibit a prominent hysteresis in the dependence on continuous - wave ( cw ) pump intensity.@xcite    the response of the optically excited polariton system becomes more complicated with allowance made for exciton spin degrees of freedom ( that corresponds to arbitrary optical polarization of the intra - cavity field ) . in the general case",
    "the system has up to four stable states under a given cw pump , whereas the actual state of the system is determined by the history of the excitation process.@xcite in critical points , where a number and/or stability of stationary solutions change , the system can exhibit sharp jumps in both the amplitude and polarization of the intra - cavity field . under a spatially inhomogeneous ( e.g. , gaussian shaped ) cw excitation",
    "the system can also exhibit a nontrivial spatial distribution of polarization of the luminescence signal , like the `` spin ring '' patterns,@xcite due to the same underlying phenomena .",
    "the strong multistability effect predicted in ref .   has recently been observed experimentally,@xcite including the sharp jumps in the cavity transmission under a smooth variation of the pump polarization degree .",
    "the spin ring patterns under gaussian shaped excitation have also been reported.@xcite all these experiments were carried out under the cw excitation .",
    "thus , one of the still remaining questions is the dynamical peculiarities of the transitions in a multistable system , which could only be traced using the time - resolved techniques . particularly , the characteristic switching times between different stability branches call for the experimental study , for they can have a crucial impact upon the practical implementations .",
    "another question concerns the theoretical approach allowing to describe the observed multistability effect in microcavities .",
    "traditionally , the multistability is considered in terms of the self - acting classical fields corresponding to macro - occupied coherent polariton modes which appear under a coherent resonant excitation.@xcite although such an approach is supposed to be sufficient to describe the bistability in a circularly polarized system,@xcite it gives wrong predictions for the general case of elliptically polarized excitation.@xcite most probably , the incoherent states of the exciton reservoir which are inevitably excited in optical experiments have a substantial impact on the decay rates and energies of polaritons . for instance , the nonlinear decay of polaritons with different circular polarizations was taken into consideration in order to explain the experimental data in ref .  .",
    "further , the nonequilibrium transitions reported in ref .   can only be reproduced in calculations taking into account the reservoir induced shifts of the polariton energy .    in the present work we report the experimental study of nonequilibrium transitions in the multistable cavity polariton system .",
    "unlike in recent refs .",
    ", we have studied the optically polarized system under a pulsed nanosecond - long excitation , which allowed us to trace the time - resolved dynamics of the intra - cavity field .",
    "the shifts in polariton energy were reflected by temporal variations in the transmission energy spectrum .",
    "thus , the employed technique is capable of visualizing the temporal correlations between the resonance energy and intensity of the intra - cavity field .",
    "we discuss in detail the time dependence of the transmission signal polarization , below as well as above the threshold , for several polarizations of the pump beam .",
    "the observed polarization behavior can not be reproduced within a semi - classical model based on the gross - pitaevskii equations considered in refs .  .",
    "the experimental results allowed us to develop a phenomenological model to describe a multistable polariton system with a proper regard to the exciton reservoir .",
    "the reservoir excitons shift the polariton energy that , in turn , influences the thresholds of nonequilibrium transitions .",
    "both the linear and nonlinear mechanisms of exciton scattering into the reservoir are found to be significant within a sub - nanosecond time scale . while the nonlinear decay of cross - circularly polarized excitons leads to the levelling of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 jump points ( which has also been found in refs .   in the cw pump regime ) , the linear decay mechanism leads to the temporal delay of the jumps with respect to the pump intensity peak .",
    "further , we apply the developed approach to simulate the parametric scattering under pumping at the magic angle .",
    "as we show , this model allows to explain self - consistently the temporal dependences of polarizations of both the driven mode and the scattering signal which appears at the polariton branch bottom .",

    "the fact that @xmath16 is negative is also confirmed by the rotation of polariton polarization direction during the process of parametric scattering.@xcite in the general case the processes of exciton - exciton interaction are mediated by biexciton and dark exciton states,@xcite hence the relation between the interaction constants of _ polaritons _ can be dependent on the exciton - photon detuning.@xcite more precisely , one should also consider the saturation of excitonic transitions as an additional nonlinear mechanism affecting the blueshift of polaritons under a sufficiently strong excitation.@xcite    if @xmath18 and @xmath20 ( as assumed in refs .   basing on the experimental estimations of ref .  ) , then the @xmath5-components of the intra - cavity field are almost uncoupled . if @xmath17 , then the threshold intensity @xmath21 .",

    ", the pump power dependence of the temporal delay between the signal and pump peaks is evidenced .",
    "the certain conditions for a switch in signal polarization depend on both the pump intensity and its temporal shape . in case of the very low pump densities ,",
    "the intra - cavity field is insufficient for multistability to reveal ; on the other hand , if the pump density is increasing quickly enough then a jump into a high - energy state happens with no delay related to the long - lived reservoir , since most of the intra - cavity field is concentrated in the driven ( optically active ) polariton state . except the case of maximum @xmath52 ,",
    "the dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] lies in the intermediate range of pump powers which all are insufficient to pull a polariton state by itself up to the threshold magnitude . instead of that",
    ", the non - equilibrium transitions proceed through the mediation of excitation accumulated by the reservoir . in such a case",
    "the development of instability in the leading polarization component ( @xmath0 ) always precedes the reservoir induced switch in signal polarization .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] , which also shows a series for two peak pump intensities at fixed @xmath123 , allows us to visualize the temporal correlations between the energy ( in both @xmath5 polarization components ) and polarization degree of the transmission signal . the overall process of the instability development is accompanied by blueshifts in @xmath5 energies . at the first stage ( which starts the earlier , the higher is pump density @xmath52 ) , the leading polarization component ( @xmath0 ) enters the region of positive feedback between its effective resonance energy @xmath128 and the @xmath0 field amplitude , so the difference in @xmath5 energies grows along with the dcp of transmission signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig:9]_b , d _ ) . accordingly , a well pronounced decrease in the dlp of transmission is observed at the same time interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig:9]_c _ ) . at approximately the half way through the energy growth",
    "( see panel  _ d _ ) , the integral occupation of reservoir becomes sufficient to provide the shift in the minor component ( @xmath1 ) , which leads to decrease in both the energy difference @xmath129 and dcp , and to the corresponding increase in dlp .",
    "all these effects are qualitatively reproduced in calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9]_e  h_. thus , the observed dynamics confirm the effect of reservoir , though the energy broadening makes the transitions much smoother compared to the cw driven system ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows the time delay of the signal with respect to the excitation pulse in a wider range of pump powers @xmath52 ; it summarizes the consideration of the threshold effects in the cavity transmission .",
    "the value of the delay @xmath130 is determined as the difference between the moments the signal and the pump reach their half - maxima for the first time : @xmath131 at small @xmath52 the response is linear , and the delays @xmath130 are expectedly small . at threshold ,",
    "the superlinear growth of the signal is observed with @xmath130 of about 150 to 200 picoseconds , i.e.at the back front of excitation .",
    "thus , this transition is induced by the reservoir as explained above . with further increasing @xmath52 ,",
    "the optically active fraction of excitons grows , which lowers the system s intertness , and the delay of response decreases .",
    "note , that the minor ( @xmath1 ) polarization component exhibits the superlinear growth at the same _ peak _ power @xmath52 as @xmath0 , and the relative delay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components , @xmath132 , remains nearly constant above the threshold .",
    "this is an extra evidence of the fact that the jump in the minor component is provided by the reservoir even at high @xmath52 .",
    "let us now consider the polarization properties of the signal of parametric scattering  generally referred to as cavity `` optic parametric oscillator '' ( opo ) signal@xcite  which appears at the branch bottom ( @xmath111 ) if pumping is at the magic angle ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "there are two points to discuss here .",
    "first , in the general case of elliptically polarized excitation the signal is expected to reflect variations in the dcp of the driven mode that , in turn , are shown to be strongly affected by the excitonic reservoir .",
    "second , if the pump is polarized linearly , the experiments show the @xmath135 rotation of the signal polarization axis;@xcite thus , we have to check if eqs .",
    "( [ ef_p_r])([res ] ) can reproduce this effect in spite of the reservoir induced interaction between the cross - circularly polarized excitons .",

    "when @xmath52 exceeds the critical value ( in the experiment @xmath140 ) , a well pronounced superlinear growth of the cavity transmission ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11]_b _ ) is observed at @xmath141 . near the threshold",
    ", a doubling of the pump power  @xmath52 leads to an order - of - magnitude growth of the opo signal intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11]_e _ ) .",
    "the observed nonlinearities indicate the onset of parametric instability , being , however , by far not as sharp as under cw excitation.@xcite    the dynamics of the driven mode is similar to that under the pumping at normal incidence . the growth of the field amplitude , which continues with increasing pump density ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11]_b _ ) , expectedly leads to the growth of transmission dcp ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11]_c _ ) due to the dominantly repulsive exciton - exciton interaction . at @xmath142ns",
    "the transmission starts to behave strongly nonlinearly with respect to the driving field , and the peak of transmission becomes significantly delayed with respect to the peak of pump pulse .",
    "the latter indicates that the transition is assisted by the reservoir induced blueshift .",
    "accordingly , the jump in transmission dcp is immediately followed by dropping back as soon as the system enters the above - threshold region where the energies of @xmath5 components of intra - cavity field ( fig .  [ fig:11]_d _ ) become partially levelled due to the reservoir filling .",
    "the domination of the leading polarization component ( @xmath0 ) is strongly enhanced in the opo signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ) whose dcp reaches  0.85 at @xmath143ns . the subsequent lowering of dcp of the driven mode forces the opo signal , too ,",
    "to partially loss its polarization .",

[ fig:4 ] ) and due to intrinsic limitations of the suggested theoretical model ( see discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "let us turn to the case of exactly linear polarization of the excitation at @xmath144 ( figs .",
    "[ fig:12 ] and [ fig:13 ] ) . in this case",
    "the opo signal depends on whether the pump excites a pure cavity state ",

    "[ fig:12 ] represents the dynamics of opo signal under the pump polarized along the tm cavity mode . in the range of high intensity of the signal ,",
    "its degree of linear polarization ( dlp ) reaches 90% .",
    "the polarization axis is @xmath135 rotated with respect to the pump ( what corresponds to negative dlp values ) , which is well reproduced in the calculations .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the pump is polarized in between the te and tm directions ( @xmath145 $ ] , fig .  [ fig:13 ] )",
    ", the signal dlp does not exceed 30% in the range of a strong signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig:13]_e _ ) .",
    "the shown dlp values were measured ( and calculated ) in the basis of directions parallel and orthogonal to pump polarization ; there is no marked dlp in the te - tm basis as well .",
    "this effect is explained by the lifted degeneracy ( te - tm splitting ) of cavity modes which leads to the variation with time of the @xmath5 phase shift .",
    "accordingly , it causes the misbalance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of intra - cavity field , i.e.  a reduced dlp and non - zero dcp of the driven mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig:13]_a , b _ ) , which is seen in both measured and calculated data . due to permanent modification of the direction of signal polarization , the eventual opo signal appears to be significantly depolarized ( the sum of squared dcp and dlp is markedly less than  1 , fig .",
    "[ fig:13]_d , e _ ) .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the opo signal confirms the effect of reservoir . under elliptic excitation ,",
    "the @xmath5 polarization components tend to be levelled by the reservoir . by itself",
    ", this effect could be assigned to a repulsion between cross - circularly polarized excitons ( @xmath146 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the axis of signal polarization is found inverted with respect to the pump , which restricts the sign of @xmath16 to be negative irrespectively of the reservoir induced blueshifts . since we have reproduced these effects within eqs .",
    "( [ ef_p_r])([res ] ) , it is proven to provide a self - consistent description of the intra - cavity field polarization dynamics .      we have shown that the semi - phenomenological eqs .",
    "( [ ef_p_r])([res ] ) explain the observed polarization dynamics in a good qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "let us now consider the limitations of the suggested approach .",
    "its most important shortcoming is the absence of a feedback between the driven polariton modes and the exciton reservoir , as long as the latter is introduced using the integral occupation number  @xmath27 , neglecting the actual microscopic distribution of reservoir states . as a result , eqs .",
    "( [ ef_p_r])([res ] ) do not describe , e.g. the establishing of equilibrium between coherent and incoherent exciton `` phases '' which would normally take place in a real system ; this process implies ( i ) the reverse transitions from the reservoir into the macro - occupied mode ( similar to bose - einstein condensation ) and ( ii ) dependence of the scattering rates ( @xmath29 and @xmath33 ) on the polariton density .",
    "these shortcomings lead to several visible discrepancies between the measured and calculated data .",
    "in particular , the superlinear drop in transmission intensity observed at the back front of exciting pulses , which is evident from comparison of left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , is not reproduced by the present model .",
    "note as well that the nonlinear scattering rate @xmath33 should depend on the energy of biexciton resonance which mediates the transitions of optically driven polaritons into the reservoir.@xcite accordingly , the actual relation between the multistability thresholds @xmath23 and @xmath22 would depend on the pump frequency as well as on the frequency detuning between photon and exciton modes .    as a result",
    ", we expect eqs .",
    "( [ ef_p_r])([res ] ) to be qualitatively valid in the case of resonant excitation of the optically active cavity states . on the other hand , in the cases of comparably large pump wave numbers and/or non - resonant excitation conditions ,",
    "when a much larger contribution of reservoir excitons is expected , the model is likely to become unsatisfactory .",
    "in the present work we have studied the non - equilibrium transitions in a multistable system of cavity polaritons under resonant nanosecond - long excitation . using the spectrally broadened pulses , we have visualized the temporal correlations between the effective resonant energy , intensity , and optical polarization of the intra - cavity field which all undergo the strong changes on reaching the threshold pump power . in the vicinity of the threshold , the dynamics of such system",
    "is strongly affected by the long - lived exciton reservoir ( excited due to polariton scattering ) which influences both the characteristic times of instability development and output signal polarization .",
    "the temporal behavior of the intra - cavity field is found to be not described in the conventional model based on the gross - pitaevskii equations written for purely coherent macro - occupied polariton states .",
    "most importantly , the observed phenomena can not be explained even qualitatively within a model with only the two exciton - exciton interaction constants ( @xmath14 ) allowed for .",
    "to explain the experiments , we have proposed the model for the macro - occupied polariton states coupled with an exciton reservoir . in spite of some limitations , this model provides a self - consistent description of the observed intra - cavity field dynamics under both pulse and continuous wave excitation conditions .",
    "authors thank m.s.skolnick for rendered samples , d.n.krizhanovskii for fruitful discussions , and a.v.larionov for assistance in the experiment .",
    "this work was supported by russian foundation for basic research and the russian academy of sciences .",
    "in attempt to reproduce the experimental pump spectrum , which is characterized by fwhm of about 0.8mev and , hence , has a lowered coherence , the modeled pump is ` broadened ' by means of the partial randomization of phases of different spectral harmonics .",
    "namely , the pump amplitude is defined as follows : @xmath147 here ,    * @xmath148 are real - valued amplitudes of the @xmath5 polarization components ; * @xmath149 defines the direction of the polarization axis ; * @xmath150 is the central pump frequency ; * @xmath151 ; * @xmath152 defines the width of the pump spectrum , @xmath153 ; * @xmath154 is a set of random uniformly distributed numbers within the interval @xmath155 .",
    "the spectral fwhm of the pump defined such a way approximately coincides with experimental one , and its coherence time is about 5 picoseconds . under these conditions",
    "the system is inevitably stochastic .",
    "hence , for each set of parameters eqs .",
    "( [ ef_p_r])([res ] ) are solved a number of times ( 20100 ) with different @xmath156 until the averaged evolution of the signal intensity becomes independent on the number of realizations .",
    "this corresponds to the collection of numerous signals , which allows us to reduce noises .",
    "the degrees of polarization are then calculated using the _ averaged _ intensities . as a result ,",
    "the transmission can be partially depolarized ( under elliptically polarized excitation ) due to small random differences in the individual pulses in much the same way as the measured signal .",
