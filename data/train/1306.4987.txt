    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) were first proposed to account for the energy source of active galactic nuclei ( agns , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "now it is well known that nearly every galaxy hosts a smbh in its center @xcite . at the same time , in a @xmath0cdm cosmology , galaxies grow by hierarchical merging @xcite , and galaxy mergers are directly observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during the merger ,",
    "the smbhs from each progenitor will sink to the center of the merger remnant and therefore it seems inevitable that the two smbhs will form a gravitationally bound pair , known as a smbh binary @xcite .",
    "merging smbhs are expected to be the strongest source of gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation for future space - based laser interferometers @xcite . however , the exact temporal evolution of these binaries , which directly determines their detection rates , remains uncertain from both a theoretical and observational perspective .",
    "our goal in this paper is to place observational constraints on the highly uncertain sub - parsec phase of smbh binary evolution .",
    "smbh binary systems evolve via the extraction of energy and angular momentum by the stars or gas in the vicinity , which makes the two bhs spiral in and coalesce . a possible scenario for smbh binary evolution in the relaxed stellar nucleus of two merging galaxies",
    "was first proposed by @xcite :    1 .   the two galaxies spiral into the galaxy center via dynamical friction .",
    "the black holes in the nuclei become gravitationally bound when the semi - major axis of their orbit reaches @xmath12 [ @xmath13 : primary ( more massive ) bh mass ; @xmath14 : number of stars in the central stellar core ; @xmath15 : average stellar mass ; @xmath16 : radius of the stellar core ] .",
    "the binary orbit is hardened by restricted @xmath17body interactions with stars during which the stars are ejected at velocities that are comparable to the orbital velocity of the binary .",
    "the binary becomes `` hard '' when its orbital velocity exceeds the velocity dispersion @xmath8 of the ambient stars , literally at @xmath18 @xmath11 @xmath19 pc @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 [ @xmath23 : secondary ( less massive ) bh mass ; @xmath24 : mass ratio @xmath25 ; @xcite ] .",

    "@xmath37 years , this critical radius is around @xmath38 to @xmath39 pc .",
    "it is still uncertain whether the transition from ( 2 ) to ( 3 ) can occur in less than a hubble time .",
    "the smbh binary will run out of stars to eject at a separation of @xmath26pc in an axisymmetric stellar potential @xcite , so the extraction of angular momentum via star ejection is no longer efficient for separations of the binary bhs on sub - parsec scales .",
    "this is the so - called `` final parsec problem '' @xcite .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed to overcome the final parsec problem , including gas accretion onto the binary @xcite , refilling the loss cone by star - star encounters @xcite and/or distorted stellar orbits in triaxial nuclei @xcite . while it remains uncertain whether these mechanisms lead to a final coalescence within a hubble time , it is certain that the binary will spend the longest time at sub - parsec separations @xcite . in principle",
    ", sub - parsec smbh binary systems may be very common .",
    "unfortunately , in practice it has proven difficult to obtain definitive observational evidence of their existence .",
    "there is indirect evidence for the presence of smbh pairs at @xmath40 kpc - scales in single galaxies detected via both direct imaging @xcite and double - peaked narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "a pc - scale bh pair cso 0402 + 379 was detected with the very long baseline array @xcite , and oj 287 is believed to be a sub - pc scale smbh binary due to its periodic luminosity variations with a period of @xmath41 yr @xcite .",
    "indirect evidence for sub - pc  scale pairs includes the precession of radio jets @xcite , double - double radio galaxies @xcite , the x - shaped radio sources @xcite and `` light deficits '' in the cores of elliptical galaxies @xcite .    however , there are no confirmed detections of sub - parsec smbh binaries to date @xcite , although they are theoretically long - lived .",
    "@xcite interpreted 3c 390.3 with double - peaked broad emission lines as two smbhs orbiting around each other , both associated with a broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "however , long - term monitoring of this object disproved the binary bh interpretation @xcite .",
    "in general , doppler motions in an accretion disk is favored to explain the double - peaked broad - emission line quasars @xcite .    as an alternative means to identify bh binaries via their orbital motion ,",
    "there have been a number of searches for large velocity displacements between single - peaked broad balmer ( mostly h@xmath42 ) emission lines and the rest - frame of the quasar host as traced ( typically ) by the narrow emission lines .",
    "these velocity shifts may signal orbital motion in a binary .",
    "promising individual candidates include 3c 227 and mrk 668 @xcite , sdss j092712.65 + 294344.0 @xcite , sdss j153636.22 + 044127.0 @xcite , sdss j093201.60 + 031858.7 @xcite , 4c+22.25 @xcite , and sdss 0956 + 5128 @xcite . for these initial extreme objects , alternate explanations to bh binaries",
    "have been proposed , including recoiling bhs @xcite or a perturbed accretion disk around a single black hole @xcite .",
    "there have now been two systematic searches through the sdss for single - peaked broad emission lines with large velocity offsets from the quasar rest frame .",
    "@xcite found five new candidates with large velocity offsets in sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ; @xcite ) quasars at @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite found 88 candidates with a broad - line peak offset @xmath44 km s@xmath7 out of the 15,900 @xmath45 quasars from sdss dr7 , corresponding to binaries with @xmath46 few @xmath47 pc . to explain these large velocity offsets in the context of a binary system , it is necessary to assume that only one of the bhs in the pair is actively accreting , and that we are catching the pair close to their maximum separation .",
    "it is theoretically plausible that only one bh in the pair should radiate since binary bhs will torque the circumbinary disk and open a cavity , analogous to type ii planet migration @xcite .",
    "this cavity may at least partially screen ambient gas from the primary black hole @xcite .    after identifying candidate bh binaries from the sdss spectroscopy based on large velocity offsets , eracleous et al .",
    "( and @xcite ) have obtained a second epoch of spectroscopy to search for the expected radial velocity offsets from orbital motion .",
    "they identify 14 candidates with velocity shifts between the sdss and second - epoch spectra due to orbital motion of the bhs , whose resulting accelerations lie between @xmath48120 and + 120 km  s@xmath7 yr@xmath7 .",
    "their methodology is very powerful , but comes with a few limitations .",
    "first , as we mentioned , the requirement of a large velocity offset ensures that the putative binary system is at its maximum velocity offset and thus the minimum acceleration in the orbit .",
    "it is necessary to wait a long time for these systems to experience significant velocity changes to truly confirm their nature .",
    "second , the method requires a robust determination of the systemic velocity of the system : at high redshift , where most of the quasars and most of the mergers are , narrow emission lines are weak to nonexistent , and so this technique is limited to @xmath49 . third , and most important , the method selects extreme objects with highly nonstandard broad lines . while these may be the result of binary motion",
    ", they may also be the result of highly uncertain blr physics .",
    "fourth , much like double - peaked agn are seen to vary perhaps due to hot spots in the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , these sources show changes in their line _ shapes _ when the line luminosity changes , providing a significant source of noise in the determination of orbital motion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for all of these reasons , we here pursue a complementary approach with no preselection on line shape .      here",
    "we propose a complementary approach to that of @xcite and @xcite , to search for smbh binaries using temporal changes in the velocity of broad emission lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , we will search for radial velocity shifts in normal , single - peaked broad emission lines in all quasars with multi - epoch spectroscopy . in the past ,",
    "such time - resolved spectroscopy was unavailable , leading to preselection of extreme velocity outliers .",
    "however , with modern multi - object spectrographs , time - domain surveys are becoming routine . in the sdss main survey , @xmath50 quasars with mg  ii",
    "have been observed multiple times , and we focus on these in our pilot experiment here . we emphasize that while we begin with this modest sample , there are already @xmath51 quasars with multiple epochs of spectroscopy observed with the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , @xcite ) to which we can apply the same method , and that upcoming surveys such as an extended boss survey and the prime focus spectrograph on subaru ( pfs , @xcite ) may provide many more .",
    "our approach is sensitive to scenarios where either each bh has its own blr or only one of the bhs is accreting . in the first scenario ,",
    "where each bh has its own blr , the broad lines are double - peaked . in this case",
    ", the orbital motion of the binary would lead to shifts in velocity of the double peaks or at least distortion of the broad emission lines ( e.g. from double - peaked to single - peaked lines when the line - of - sight velocities of the binary bhs decrease from maximum to zero during 1/4 of their orbit , @xcite ) .",
    "our approach is sensitive to these types of line - shape changes in principle , while search methods looking for persistant double peaks or extremely high velocity offsets between broad and narrow lines may miss these systems .",
    "if only one of the binary bhs is accreting , the single - peaked broad lines will trace the orbital motion of one of the binary bhs .",
    "our method favors the phases of the binary orbit with large drifts in the projected radial velocity ( i.e. , acceleration ) of the secondary bh , while previous studies are tuned to catch the maximum projected orbital velocity along the line of sight .",
    "since we do not require narrow lines to identify the velocity rest - frame , we can in principle search agns at all redshifts by studying broad emission lines in the rest - frame optical and ultraviolet part of the agn spectra ( e.g. mg  ii , c  iii ] , c  iv , ly  @xmath52 , etc . ) .",
    "of course , our approach has disadvantages and complications as well .",
    "like @xcite and @xcite , we are sensitive to intrinsic variability in the broad emission lines .",
    "also , because our targets are so luminous , we are heavily biased towards near - equal mass ratios , limiting the demographic reach of our survey .",
    "finally , and most difficult to quantify , we rely on each bh having its own broad - line region .",
    "if the blr surrounds both sources , we will no longer be sensitive to radial velocity shifts ; given the major uncertainties in blr physics , this is a major caveat .",
    "our paper will proceed as follows .",
    "we describe the selection and basic properties of our sample in  [ sec : sample ] , and introduce the cross - correlation method in  [ sec : cross ] .",
    "the results of our experiment are presented in  [ sec : candidateselection ] and we estimate the observability of smbh binary systems with our detection strategy assuming various scenarios for their evolution in  [ sec : observability ] , and predict the observability with data from next generation surveys in  [ sec : next ] .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we will use the quasar catalog from the sdss to search for binary black holes . specifically ,",
    "we will focus on quasars with multiple observations and search for velocity changes in the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "we start with the quasar catalog from dr7 @xcite with 147,330 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ( with no luminosity cutoff ) , among which 6996 quasars have multiple observations ( quasars are identified with sdss ids and different observations for each quasar are labeled by different plate - mjd - fiber ids in sdss spectra ) .",
    "these objects were targeted based on their nonstellar colors in @xmath53 broad - band photometry and by matching the unresolved sources to the first radio catalogs @xcite .",
    "the calibrated digital spectra from sdss dr7 have a wavelength range of 3800 - 9200   with spectral resolution of @xmath54 , and each spectral pixel has a width of @xmath55 km  s@xmath7 .    in some cases , the sdss has taken multiple spectra of the same quasars , which gives us the chance to search for orbital motion of the central bhs .",
    "there are several strong broad lines in the rest - frame optical and uv , including h@xmath42 @xmath56 , mg  ii @xmath57 and c  iv @xmath58 .",
    "both the h@xmath42 and c  iv broad lines have additional sources of complexity when it comes to measuring their radial velocity .",
    "the high - ionization c   iv line emerges from the very inner region of the agn broad line region ( blr ) and often shows asymmetry and absorption that might be related to disk outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the moment , we will avoid using c  iv .",
    "the h@xmath42 and mg  ii lines come from further out in the blr , where the gas is cooler @xcite .",
    "indeed , in principle h@xmath42 is attractive because the strong narrow emission from both h@xmath42 and [ o  iii ] @xmath59 could serve as a velocity reference @xcite .",
    "however , we experimented with fitting the narrow emission lines , and subtracting them to expose the h@xmath42 broad line .",
    "we found that the shape of the residual h@xmath42 broad line can be very uncertain , compromising the subsequent measurement of velocity shifts . in any case , the number of objects with multiple observations in the lower redshift range needed to measure h@xmath42 is small .",
    "therefore , we focus on the mg  slowromancap2@ broad lines as our diagnostic of orbital motion of the secondary black hole in this work .    to keep mg  slowromancap2@ in the wavelength window , we select quasars with @xmath60 and multiple observations . while @xmath61 quasars also have the centroid of mg  slowromancap2@ in the 3800 - 9200   window , the data near the red end of the sdss spectra suffer from sky subtraction errors , which are severe contaminants .",
    "we thus exclude the @xmath61 quasars from our analysis .",
    "we also reject spectra with more than 100 pixels of missing data ( as flagged with a zero in their inverse variance spectra ) .",
    "finally we have a sample of 4204 quasars .",
    "we have not explicitly rejected spectra from ` marginal ' or ` bad ' plates .",
    "these flags indicate that the s / n may be low on the plate or data may be missing from many of the spectra .",
    "we pay extra attention to those candidates with marginal or bad quality flags .",
    "indeed , many of the plates in our sample may have been reobserved due to ` marginal ' quality originally .",
    "finally , as we will state in section [ sec : candidateselection ] , we find that spectra with low signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) confuse our cross - correlation procedure , so we construct a high s / n sample of 1523 objects with s / n pixel@xmath7 @xmath62 10 to focus on the most reliable cross - correlation measurements .",
    "our final candidates will be selected from the high s / n subsample of 1523 objects .",
    "the basic properties of the whole sample and the high s / n subsample are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleinfo ] . the redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleinfo]a ) are measured by template fitting of the quasar spectra with least - squares linear combinations of redshifted template eigenspectra @xcite .",
    "the mean redshift is @xmath63 . the mean time interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleinfo]b ) between two observations of the same quasar is 0.7 years with a range from 0.003 to 7.03 years . the @xmath64-band absolute magnitude of the sample ( fig . [ fig : sampleinfo]c ) ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 mag with a median value of @xmath67 mag .",
    "the blue dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleinfo]a , [ fig : sampleinfo]b and [ fig : sampleinfo]c are the corresponding property distributions of the high s / n subsample .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleinfo](d ) , the black ( solid and dash - dotted ) lines are bh mass distributions for the 4047 quasars in the whole sample ( 157 agns do nt have available bh masses ; they are assigned the median bh mass ) , while the blue ( dotted and dashed ) lines are for the high s / n subsample ( 6 of which do not have bh masses ) .",
    "we present two estimates of the bh mass . the solid and",
    "the dashed lines represent bh masses measured from the mg   slowromancap2@ broad - line widths from @xcite .",
    "they range from @xmath68 @xmath3 to @xmath69 @xmath3 and are peaked at @xmath70 @xmath3 ( or @xmath71 @xmath3 ) for the whole sample ( high s / n subsample ) . taking the bh masses at face value together with the bolometric luminosities of these quasars @xcite , the eddington ratios ( @xmath72 ) have a median value of @xmath73 while ranging from 0.02 to 2.7 .",
    "the dash - dotted and dotted lines are lower limits on the bh mass derived from the bolometric luminosities @xcite , assuming that the bolometric luminosity of each quasar is @xmath74 of its eddington luminosity .",
    "they range from @xmath75 @xmath3 to @xmath76 @xmath3 and are peaked at @xmath77 @xmath3 ( or @xmath78 @xmath3 ) for the whole sample ( high s / n subsample ) .",
    "we are searching for a change in velocity in the mg  ii line linked to orbital motion in a sub - pc bh binary . note that the sdss measures a redshift for every quasar at every epoch as well . in principle",
    ", we could use these redshift measurements to find cases of large radial velocity shifts .",
    "however , the sdss redshift measurements have a larger dispersion from one epoch to the next than our method . therefore , we use a single redshift for each quasar to move the spectra to the rest frame .",
    "all the following analyses are performed in the rest frame of the quasar .    in order to isolate this signal",
    ", we must isolate the broad emission line from the continuum of the quasar .",
    "we find that variability in the quasar continuum can significantly decrease the sensitivity of the cross - correlation to the broad - line velocity shift .",
    "we fit the continuum with a fifth - order polynomial .",
    "we prefer this to a power - law because in some spectra the blue end of the continuum drops significantly due to an artifact , making it impossible to fit with a single power - law . in fitting the continuum , we mask all the main emission lines and the @xmath79 wavelength regions around the centroids in the range from 1000   to 7300  ( the centroid wavelengths and widths are from @xcite , table 2 ) , namely : o vi ( 1000    1070  ) , ly @xmath52 ( 1142  1290  ) , si iv ( 1389    1411  ) , c  iv ( 1526    1572  ) , c iii ] ( 1892    1926  ) , mg   ii ( 2770    2826  ) , h@xmath80 ( 4318    4364  ) , h@xmath42 ( 4810    4912  ) , [ o iii ] ( 4928    5038  ) , he i ( 5800    6000  , 7000    7200  ) and h@xmath52 ( 6300    6800  ) .",
    "we subtract the fitted continuum to expose the mg  ii broad lines .",
    "one example is shown in figure [ fig : example]a .    secondly , we cross - correlate the continuum - subtracted spectra from the two epochs , using all data in the wavelength range @xmath81 1700    4000  .",
    "we weight the flux in each pixel with its inverse variance from the sdss observation , which efficiently prevents bad pixels from confusing our analysis .",
    "we calculate the cross - correlation at various trial velocity shifts : @xmath82 [ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1 } ( b_k - \\bar{b})^2]}}\\ ] ] where a and b are the spectra from the two epochs , and d is the trial delay .",
    "the spacing of the trial delays is 17.3 km  s@xmath7 , @xmath83 of the sdss spectral resolution .",
    "thirdly , we look for the peak in the cross - correlation function and define the corresponding trial velocity shift as our `` best '' measurement of velocity shift .",
    "the method we use to find the peak in the cross - correlation function is adapted from the sdss iii ( boss ) pipeline @xcite , which measures centroids of peaks using a gaussian fit around the minimum @xmath84 .",
    "the peak cross - correlation values we find are equivalent to the maximum value in most cases , but in some extreme cases where there are offset local fluctuations sitting on the `` true '' peak , this gaussian fitting method behaves better . in general , the uncertainty returned from the peak fitting is small ( @xmath85  km  s@xmath7 ) , and thus much smaller than our systematic uncertainties (  [ subsec : uncertainty ] ) .",
    "an example of our cross - correlation and peak hunting is shown in fig [ fig : example]b .",
    "we mainly focus on the spectral region directly surrounding mg   ii ( 2700    2900  ) , where the strongest cross - correlation signal can be found .",
    "however , we are throwing away real information in the weaker broad emission lines such as fe ii , which are found throughout the rest - frame near - uv spectrum .",
    "thus , we also perform a wider fit to the region between 1700   and 4000  .",
    "(  [ subsec : uncertainty ] ) . using two wavelength regions",
    "allows us to remove many false positives that come from the narrow mg  ii considered alone .",
    "we measured broad - line velocity shifts for all of the 4204 quasars in our sample , and their distribution is shown in fig [ fig : histo - errbar ] . since most of the quasars have very short time intervals between observations , their velocities will not change even if they harbor binary bhs .",
    "therefore , the width of this histogram represents the typical errors incurred from noise in the data , sky subtraction and wavelength calibration errors , the finite width of the broad lines and intrinsic variability in broad emission or absorption line shape .",
    "it is peaked at zero and its width is @xmath86  km  s@xmath7 . in practice , we find that spectra with low s / n confuse our cross - correlation procedure , so we construct a high s / n sample of 1523 objects with s / n pixel@xmath7 @xmath87 to focus on the most reliable cross - correlation measurements . the distribution of measured velocity shifts in the high s / n sample is shown in fig [ fig : histo - errbar ] .",
    "we get a histogram width of @xmath88 km  s@xmath7 for this subsample , and accordingly we set @xmath89 km  s@xmath7 as the lower limit for `` significant velocity drifts '' such that we expect @xmath90 false positive detection in the high s / n sample .",
    "however , we also insist that the cross - correlation measured from the mg   ii region alone be consistent within @xmath91 to that measured over the entire spectral region . by comparing the cross - correlations of the two regions , we are able to remove apparent shifts that are due to some small errors in sky subtraction , for instance .    in the end",
    ", we pick our final list of candidates from the high s / n sample with the following criteria :    velocity shifts measured with the two methods ( cross - correlating the whole spectral range or only the mg ii line ) should satisfy : ( 1 ) at least one of the two measurements is larger than 280 km  s@xmath7 ; ( 2 ) the difference between them is less than @xmath91 or 82 km  s@xmath7 ; ( 3 ) the error in the cross - correlation fit is @xmath92  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "seven objects obey these criteria .",
    "the selected candidates are described in table [ table : selected ] .",
    "one of our final candidates ( sdss j095656.42 + 535023.2 ) comes from a plate flagged as ` bad ' .",
    "this flag reflects the very poor seeing conditions and bright sky when the data were taken , and may lead to large spectrophotometric uncertainty .",
    "however , most of the spurious features are introduced in the red end of the spectrum , far from the mg  ii line .",
    "we thus believe that our polynomial continuum fit will account for any remaining flux calibration issues in this target . noting that most of the sources have velocity shifts very close to our limit",
    ", we consider seven as an upper limit to the total number of detections in our sample .",
    "interestingly , most of our candidates have @xmath93 . we suspect that this is due to the increasing difficulties of working in the red .",
    "the distribution of bh masses is quite similar to that of the whole sample .",
    "according to these bh masses and the measured accelerations , the candidate smbh binaries are expected to have separations of @xmath94 pc at maximum .",
    "the numbers are small , but we find no abnormal spectral properties among these seven candidates .",
    "for instance , their sdss colors ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) do not seem atypical for qsos in this redshift range , as may be expected for a circumbinary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    since the velocity shifts in the mg  ii broad lines are small compared with the linewidths , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we plot the ratio of the spectra at the two epochs for each candidate , at wavelengths around mg  ii and h@xmath42 ( if present ) .",
    "these ratio spectra nicely highlight the velocity shifts via  bumps \" or  valleys \" around the line peaks .",
    "we clearly see such features in the ratio spectra of sdss j032223.02 + 000803.5 , sdss j002444.11 - 003221.4 , sdss j095656.42 + 535023.2 , sdss j161609.50 + 434146.8 and sdss j093502.54 + 433110.7 .",
    "one target , sdss j093502.54 + 433110.7 , is in common with @xcite .    while using the cross - correlation of two spectral regions",
    "effectively removes spurious targets , it also may remove some real targets .",
    "thus , for completeness , in table [ table : selected2 ] , we list all 64 targets that are recovered with velocity shifts larger than @xmath96  km  s@xmath7  by the mg ii cross - correlation alone , for future more detailed follow - up . note that none of these targets comes from a ` bad ' plate although a few are from marginal plates as indicated .",
    "however , given the many uncertainties remaining in selecting these targets , we will consider seven objects as an upper limit on the true number of detected binary systems in our sample for the purposes of discussion .",
    "there are various sources of uncertainties in our measurements , including wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , continuum subtraction and cross - correlation errors .",
    "the statistical error reported by the cross - correlation procedure is typically @xmath97  km  s@xmath7 , with only @xmath98 of objects having uncertainties greater than @xmath99  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we further create mock spectra using the sdss variance arrays , and perform input - output tests of our cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we recover a very narrow distribution of uncertainties in our output velocity shifts ( @xmath100  km  s@xmath7  in all cases ) .",
    "random errors alone can not explain the width of the velocity distribution that we observe .",
    "one source of systematic uncertainty comes from our choice of wavelength region for the cross - correlation .",
    "while the cross correlation over the whole range [ 1700 , 4000 ] helps us remove some false - positives , it also introduces further potential sources of uncertainty .",
    "for instance , absorption from the ca h+k lines around the 4000  break , or errors in sky subtraction , may confuse our technique . as a sanity check , we did another set of cross correlations for the seven candidates over [ 1700 , 3800 ] to exclude ca h+k absorption lines .",
    "only three of the seven candidates ( sdss j002444.11 - 003221.4 , sdss j095656.42 + 535023.2 , sdss j004918.98 + 002609.4 ) survive this test .",
    "these are our three most reliable candidates . as a result",
    ", we consider seven as an upper limit in what follows .",
    "there are many other contributions to the velocity uncertainties .",
    "the first effect is uncertainties in sky subtraction , as already discussed .",

    "our calculation of @xmath110 closely follows that in @xcite , which provides a recipe for computing the fully coupled , time - dependent binary+disk evolution , and should be referred to for details .",

    "@xcite has shown that the torque acting on the binary and driving its inspiral is set by @xmath151 , the radius of influence @xmath158 out to which the binary torque has been propagated by the viscous stresses in the disk , and the degree of mass overflow across the orbit of the secondary , i.e. the fraction @xmath159 of @xmath151 that penetrates into the cavity and gets accreted by the binary components .",
    "the dependence on the latter is rather weak and the orbital evolution is similar to the no - overflow case as long as @xmath160 , which we assume to be the case in this work for simplicity . of course ,",

    "the time dependence of the radius of influence is self - consistently computed by following the viscous evolution of the circumbinary disk torqued by the binary , as described in @xcite . in calculating @xmath158",
    "we keep track of the different physical regimes in the disk at @xmath158 .",

    "this self - consistent calculation favorably distinguishes our present calculation ( and that in @xcite ) from the self - similar solution of @xcite or the smbh inspiral calculations in @xcite .",
    "one particular aspect of the @xmath110 calculation that we wish to emphasize is that in many cases we find the system in so - called _ disk - dominated _ evolution , a regime when the `` local disk mass '' different by factors of @xmath162 or @xmath163 can be found in the literature . ]",

    "this regime is often valid at the initial stages of evolution , especially for lower smbh masses , because of the large starting semi - major axis of 0.1 pc that we adopt in this work . in this regime",
    "we follow conventional wisdom @xcite and simply assume that the secondary passively follows viscous evolution of the disk , which is equivalent to setting @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the viscous time at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , computed using the _ local _ value of viscosity @xmath168 and accounting for the possibility of mass pileup at the inner disk edge . as the binary orbit shrinks , the system inevitably transitions into the _ secondary - dominated _ regime , when @xmath169 .",
    "as soon as this happens we let the disk respond viscously to the binary torque . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : tres ] we show maps of @xmath110 computed according to the aforementioned prescription @xcite for several values of @xmath24 and @xmath177 .",
    "several features of these maps are worth discussing . at high masses ( and small separations )",
    "color contours turn into straight lines which reflects the fact that in this regime the binary inspiral is determined by gravitational wave ( gw ) emission . in this case",
    "@xmath110 is simply given by t_gw(r_b)= ( ) ^4 , [ eq : t_gw ] where @xmath178 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole with the combined mass @xmath101 .",

    "thus , our quasars are in the regime when the disk torque dominates binary inspiral .",
    "figure [ fig : tres ] also reveals some obvious trends with @xmath24 and @xmath179 .",
    "lower @xmath24 results in faster inspiral since for a lower - mass secondary the binary contains less angular momentum but the disk torque is relatively insensitive to @xmath24 , see @xcite .",
    "higher @xmath179 at a fixed @xmath101 implies a circumbinary disk with higher surface density , which provides more torque , considerably accelerating the orbital evolution of the binary .",
    "higher @xmath179 also extends the disk - dominated phase of the binary evolution .",
    "in particular , at low masses ( and large separations ) @xmath110 exhibits rather weak dependence on @xmath101 , which is a result of the system evolving in a disk - dominated regime where the inspiral time is given by the local viscous timescale , which is only weakly dependent on @xmath101 .    quite important for our work is the relatively weak dependence of @xmath110 on separation in some cases , e.g. low @xmath179 and relatively high @xmath24 , which results in rather long @xmath110 for @xmath180 pc and increases the number of binaries in this range of @xmath107 .",
    "this behavior is a result of two main factors .",
    "first , initially , when the system is in the disk - dominated regime , the inner parts of the disk around the binary are gas - pressure dominated . under these conditions",
    "the viscous timescale on which the binary orbit evolves in the disk - dominated case is a relatively weak function of @xmath107 compared to the radiation pressure - dominated case typical for high @xmath181 @xcite , so that @xmath110 is quite long at @xmath182 pc .",
    "second , even after evolution switches to the secondary - dominated regime , binary inspiral is slow and is still not very sensitive to the separation [ e.g. see the behavior of @xmath110 in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite ] .",
    "it is very important that here we self - consistently follow the time - dependent structure of the whole disk in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "previously , @xcite found considerably faster binary evolution ( lower @xmath110 ) for the same @xmath101 , @xmath107 , etc .  when employing the quasi - steady state circumbinary disk solutions derived in @xcite , which do not apply to real disks , see @xcite for details .",
    "the non - locality of the binary - disk coupling in the secondary - dominated regime @xcite  the fact that for a given value of @xmath183 at the inner disk edge ( equal to zero in the case of no overflow ) the magnitude of the torque acting on the binary is set by the disk properties not at its inner edge , which is often radiation - pressure dominated , but much further out , at @xmath158 , where the disk is gas - pressure dominated  is also very important for determining the residence time .      in computing observability , we consider two basic scenarios for the bh binary : no temporal evolution , and radial migration via a gaseous accretion disk .",

    "[ sec : timeevolution ] , detectability depends on the evolutionary scenario of smbh binaries at sub - parsec scales . in a scenario where circumbinary disks drive the inspiral of bh binaries following the @xmath110 distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : tres ] , the observability as a function of the time interval between observations of the same quasar is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction_disk ] ( left panel for @xmath215 , and right panel for @xmath216 ) where the star marks the upper limit on the detectability from our detection in the sdss dr7 high s / n subsample .    as before ( see  [ sec : results ] ) , the eddington ratio @xmath72 makes a big difference because : ( 1 ) larger @xmath72 corresponds to smaller bh masses at a given luminosity , which leads to smaller velocity drifts at all separations , and ( 2 ) the time @xmath110 that bh binaries spend at intermediate separations is smaller for higher @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution of eddington ratios likely lies between these two limits for the majority of sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for major mergers ( @xmath217 1 ) with @xmath218",
    ", we would expect @xmath11 20% of the sources to show orbital motions for a time interval of @xmath214 years , which would correspond to a large number of targets in next - generation surveys ( e.g. , 1800 expected candidates from boss qso sample with multiple observations ) .",
    "considering our constraints on the fraction of quasars that are triggered in a tight binary phase ( @xmath219 33% ) , the expected observability in the scenario above is @xmath11 6.7% .",
    "however , this value drops to @xmath11 1% if most sources are closer to @xmath216 .",
    "more extreme mass ratios would yield much higher observability , given the assumption that all the observed quasars are the secondary bhs , but to probe such low mass ratios we likely would need to observe less luminous ( lower mass ) qsos . we should again caution that our predictions are very sensitive to the assumption of blr size . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction_disk ] shows , the observability drops by a factor of @xmath11 10 if we increase the blr size by a factor of 2 .",
    "if we increase the blr size further , e.g. by a factor of 4 , we expect no detections even with a time interval of 100 years ( not shown ) . on the contrary , for tidally truncated blrs",
    ", the observability would actually increase from our fiducial calculations .            in the scenario that the smbh binaries stall for a hubble time near @xmath26 pc",
    ", the observability of the binaries versus time interval between repeated observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction_stall ] .",
    "observabilities increase dramatically as the mass ratio @xmath24 decreases , because the stalling radius of the binary due to the depletion of stars is much smaller for smaller @xmath24 . for comparable - mass binaries , we may only hope to detect a shift in repeated observations separated by @xmath11 100 years .",
    "thus , the only way to carve out this parameter space is to push to lower secondary masses ( i.e. , lower luminosities than have been observed by the sdss ) .    , 0.1 , 0.01 from bottom to top respectively .",
    "the black solid lines utilize black hole masses from broad - line width measurements , while the red dashed lines use the eddington - limited bh masses estimated from bolometric luminosity . in the @xmath147 case ,",
    "the stalling radius ( eq . [ eq : rstall ] ) is so large that no bh binaries are expected to be observed within 100 yrs using the eddington - limited bh mass distribution so there is no red dashed line for it.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the subaru prime focus spectrograph ( pfs , @xcite ) , a new fiber - fed optical and near - infrared spectrograph that is now being planned , will be able to study qsos over a wide redshift range .",
    "it will observe quasars down to @xmath220 24 mag , which is much deeper than sdss .",
    "it could also target up to 20 qsos deg@xmath221 from sdss over the 1400 deg@xmath222 wide survey area .",
    "therefore , nearly all the sdss qsos could be reobserved , providing a very large sample of qsos with long - baseline repeat observations . considering that the total quasar sample from dr7 is of order @xmath223 objects ,",
    "we can think of constraining binary fractions as low as @xmath224 , with time baselines greater than a decade , as potentially observable in the near future .",
    "we have employed a new method to search for sub - parsec supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries .",
    "we make use of repeat observations of quasars at @xmath1 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and look for temporal changes in the line - of - sight velocity of the mg  slowromancap2@ broad emission line using cross - correlation .",
    "a radial velocity drift in the broad emission lines can be interpreted as an orbital acceleration of the accreting black hole and its associated broad - line region . from the sdss quasar catalog ,",
    "we find a sample of 4204 quasars with multiple observations ( 1791 of them with @xmath225 year ) and select 1523 quasars with s / n per pixel @xmath62 10 as a more reliable subsample .",
    "the absolute magnitude in @xmath64 of the whole sample ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 mag with a mean value of @xmath67 mag .",
    "we use two sets of bh masses : using mg  ii line widths , the bh masses range from @xmath226 @xmath3 and peak at @xmath227 ; if we simply estimate a lower limit to the bh mass assuming all sources radiate at 50% of their eddington luminosity we find a mass range of @xmath228 @xmath3 and a peak at @xmath229 .",
    "the velocity shifts measured by cross - correlation have a distribution peaked at 0 km  s@xmath7 with @xmath230 km  s@xmath7 for the whole sample and @xmath231 km  s@xmath7 for the high s / n subsample .",
    "we set the criteria for our smbh binary candidates as : the velocity shift measured with cross - correlation over either the whole spectral range or only the mg  ii line region should be larger than @xmath232 ( 280 km  s@xmath7 ) , and the difference between the two measurements should be less than @xmath91 ( @xmath11 82 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "we select seven binary bh candidates out of the high s / n subsample , of which three are most reliable .",
    "we are now following these up to search for continued evidence of orbital motion .    comparing the detectability of smbh binaries with the number of candidates ( @xmath233 )",
    ", we can rule out that all @xmath10 m@xmath234 bhs exist in @xmath11 0.030.2 pc scale binaries , in a scenario where binaries stall at a sub - pc scale radius for a hubble time . in the scenario of gas - assisted smbh binary evolution , our analysis reports that @xmath235 33% of quasars host smbh binaries with orbital separations @xmath236pc at their centers , subject to outstanding uncertainties in the bh masses and blr sizes .",
    "we should also ask what the cosmological expectations are for such binaries . while a full exploration is beyond the scope of this work , we note from the simulations of @xcite that massive host galaxies will have experienced numerous major ( @xmath237 ) mergers since redshift @xmath238 . furthermore , according to simulations , pairing of smbhs via dynamical friction is most effective for major mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our results are already cosmologically relevant . in the future",
    ", we may hope to constrain the lifetime of sub - pc binaries with larger samples .",
    "we also estimate the observability of smbh binaries with next generation surveys , such as boss or the prime focus spectrograph on subaru , in the context of the disk - assisted inspiral scenario . with the reobservation of sdss quasars by these new surveys",
    ", we will have a much larger sample with much longer time baselines to investigate the temporal change of broad emission lines .",
    "these future observations will help constrain evolutionary scenarios of smbh binaries .",
