    "the graphs we study are simple , connected , undirected graphs of valency four , admitting an orientation of their edges preserved by a vertex - transitive and edge - transitive subgroup of the automorphism group , that is , graphs of valency four admitting a _ half - arc - transitive _ group action .",
    "many of these graphs arise as medial graphs for regular maps on riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "the work of marui , summarised in @xcite , demonstrated the importance of a certain family of cyclic subgraphs for understanding the internal structure of these graphs , namely their _",
    "alternating cycles_. these are cycles in which each two consecutive edges have opposite orientations .",
    "they were introduced in @xcite and their basic properties were studied in @xcite .",
    "the families of oriented graphs studied in this paper were singled out in @xcite because they demonstrate three different extremes for the structure of their alternating cycles : namely the alternating cycles are ` loosely attached ' , ` antipodally attached ' or ` tightly attached ' ( see subsection  [ sec : alt ] ) .",
    "these families are based on one of two infinite families of underlying unoriented valency four graphs ( called @xmath0 and @xmath1 for positive integers @xmath2 ) , and for each family three different edge - orientations are induced by three different subgroups of their automorphism groups ( section  [ sub : results ] ) ; the three different edge - orientations correspond to the three different attachment properties of their alternating cycles . in this paper",
    "it is shown in theorem  [ thm : allorients ] that these are essentially the only edge - orientations of the underlying graphs which are invariant under a half - arc - transitive group action .",
    "our approach is to study the normal quotients of these ` @xmath3-graphs ' and ` @xmath4-graphs ' ( as explained below ) , and in doing so we discover that graphs from a third family arise , the ` @xmath5-graphs ' .",
    "we find ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) that normal quotients of the @xmath3-graphs are sometimes @xmath3-graphs , sometimes @xmath4-graphs , and sometimes @xmath5-graphs , and the same is true for normal quotients of the @xmath4-graphs . in addition",
    "we determine in theorem  [ thm : mainb ] those oriented graphs in these families which are ` basic ' in the sense that all their proper normal quotients are degenerate ( see subsection  [ sec : nquot ] ) .",
    "the normal quotient approach was introduced in @xcite to study oriented graphs , focusing on the structure of certain quotient graphs rather than subgraphs . for a connected oriented four - valent graph @xmath6 with corresponding vertex- and edge - transitive group @xmath7 preserving the edge - orientation , a _ normal quotient _ of @xmath8 is determined by a normal subgroup @xmath9 of @xmath7 .",
    "it is the graph @xmath10 with vertices the @xmath9-orbits on the vertices of @xmath6 , and with distinct @xmath9-orbits @xmath11 adjacent provided there is some edge of @xmath6 between a vertex of @xmath12 and a vertex of @xmath13 .",
    "the normal quotient theory in @xcite asserts ( with specified degenerate exceptions ) that the normal quotient @xmath10 has valency four , and inherits an edge - orientation from @xmath6 which is preserved by the quotient group @xmath14 acting transitively on vertices and edges , and , moreover , @xmath6 is a cover of @xmath10 ( that is , for adjacent @xmath9-orbits @xmath11 , each vertex of @xmath12 is adjacent to exactly one vertex of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we call a pair @xmath8 _ basic _ if the only proper normal quotients ( that is , taking @xmath15 ) are degenerate",
    ". each pair @xmath8 has at least one basic normal quotient , ( more details are given in section  [ sec : prelim ] , and see @xcite ) .",
    "for the pairs @xmath8 we study in this paper , there is always a basic normal quotient which lies in one of the families ( possibly a different family from the family containing @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus , although all the graph - group pairs in a given family share the same properties of their alternating cycles ( remark  [ rem : xy ] ) , the structure of the family can be further elucidated by studying the much smaller subfamily of basic pairs .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the set of all graph - group pairs @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is a connected graph of valency four , @xmath7 is a vertex - transitive and edge - transitive subgroup of automorphisms , and @xmath7 preserves an orientation of the edges .",
    "in particular @xmath7 is not transitive on the arcs of @xmath6 ( ordered pairs of vertices which form an edge ) , and such a group action is called _ half - arc - transitive_.    alternatively we could interpret each pair @xmath17 as consisting of a connected , undirected graph @xmath6 of valency four , and a group @xmath7 of automorphisms acting half - arc - transitively .",
    "such a group action determines an edge - orientation of @xmath6 ( up to reversing the orientation on every edge ) .",
    "it is possible for a single graph to have different edge - orientations determined by different subgroups of automorphisms .",
    "this is the case with the examples in subsection  [ sub : results ]  ( a ) and ( b ) . by viewing the fundamental objects of study as undirected graphs endowed with ( perhaps several ) edge - orientations , we are able to give a unified discussion of all possible edge - orientations preserved by half - arc - transitive group actions .",
    "our notation is therefore slightly different from the papers @xcite where different names for the same graph are used for different edge - orientations .",
    "the alternating cycles of @xmath8 ( defined above ) , are determined by the edge - orientation .",
    "they partition the edge set , they all have the same even length , denoted by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is called the _ radius _ of @xmath8 , and if two alternating cycles share at least one vertex , then they intersect in a constant number @xmath20 of vertices , called the _ attachment number _ , such that @xmath20 divides @xmath18  ( * ? ? ?",
