    "the stick representation of mathematical knots ordinarily are composed of line segments that are as long or short as desired , but can not bend in any way . in this paper , we instead think of the sticks as collections of vectors , and apply certain limitations on the vectors to see what kind of knots we can get .",

    "the reason this topic is interesting is because the same set of vectors can form vastly different knot projections if reordered in different ways , sometimes even by slightly different reorderings .",

    "traditional crossing \" , refers to any point on a knot projection where exactly two strands intersect .",
    "the following three knot invariants are used throughout the paper .",
    "the crossing number of a knot , @xmath11 , is the minimum number of crossings in any projection of a knot .",
    "this means if some knot projection has @xmath0 crossings , but one or more of the crossings can be removed by a series of reidemeister moves , then @xmath12 for that knot .",
    "the stick number of a knot , @xmath13 , is the minimum number of line segments that can be used to construct a knot .",
    "the stick number of the trefoil knot is 6 , meaning that if we have less than 6 straight line segments , we can not make a nontrivial knot .",
    "the bridge index of a knot , @xmath14 , is the minimum number of local maximums of a knot from any direction in the xy - plane .",

    "in this section , we identify necessary criteria for a projection of a set of @xmath0 vectors must have in order to make a nontrivial knot in @xmath9 .",

    "this is because by definition , a crossing occurs when we are following the orientation of a knot ( or set of vectors ) and go back upon a previous strand ( or vector ) .",
    "corollary [ one direction ] naturally follows from lemma [ i j ] :    given a projection of nonzero vectors that sum to @xmath1 in @xmath2 , if only one vector has an @xmath15-component ( or @xmath16-component ) of one sign and the rest have zero or oppositely signed @xmath15-components ( or @xmath16-component , respectively ) , then the vectors will form only trivial knots no matter how they are reordered .",

    "let the vector with unique @xmath15-component ( or @xmath16-component ) be @xmath17 . to get crossings , we would need to go back in a direction towards a previous vector when adding tip - to - tail .",
    "however , since we have already used our vector @xmath17 , any subsequent vectors must go in the opposite @xmath15 direction of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that any pair of vectors in @xmath18 ... @xmath19 will not cross , no matter how they are ordered .",
    "it is indeed possible to cross @xmath17 by facing vectors towards its @xmath20-coordinate ( or @xmath21-coordinate , respectively ) value .",
    "no matter how these crossings look in @xmath9 , either end of the twist could easily be undone with a reidemeister i move , which could be repeated with the resulting twist , until we are left with the unknot .",

    "we explore the results of lemma [ one direction ] further by investigating what sufficient and necessary conditions three vectors must have in order to make a crossing ( even if the crossing is trivial ) .",

    "according to lemma [ i j ] , our third vector can not be in the same half of the xy - plane as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , since we would not have @xmath15- and @xmath16-components of both signs .",
    "this means the third vector , @xmath24 , must be exclusively between the two dotted lines .",

    "the only instance where the vectors wo nt cross using this algorithm is when the angle between each pair of vectors is equal .",

    "this does not give us a crossing , but rather a closed loop that is an equilateral triangle . ]",
    "any set of 3 vectors of equal length must cross ( or form a closed loop ) , as without loss of generality there will always be at least one acute angle between either @xmath23 and -@xmath22 ( the dotted line opposite to @xmath22 ) or @xmath24 and -@xmath22 .",
    "this is true because the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath24 must be less than 180 degrees , since we have limited our option of @xmath24 to be exclusively between the two dotted lines .",
    "this means between -@xmath22 and either @xmath23 or @xmath24 , there could be either an obtuse angle and an acute angle , or two acute angles .",
    "because when reordering our vectors we can always form an acute interior angle with @xmath22 and our second vector , we can always pick the smallest angle between @xmath22 and either @xmath23 or @xmath24 , which will result in the minimal change in y - value . because our 3 vectors have equal lengths",

    "the simplest way to reorder the remaining vectors would be in terms of ascending @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the polar angle measured from the positive @xmath21-axis when the tails of the vectors are placed at the origin of the @xmath118-plane .",
    "the resulting projection will always be isotopic to a projection of the @xmath4 knot . additionally ,",

    "a * triple crossing * of a knot projection has three strands intersecting at a point , as opposed to traditional crossings which are only composed of two strands . to define what this means for the knot in @xmath9",

    "we can pick these without loss of generality because of rotational symmetry .",

    "now that we have a knot projection with a triple crossing and traditional crossing , we must add crossing information .",
    "however , we do nt have to check all of these cases .",
    "no matter how we label the strands of the triple crossing , the top strand will always be part of 2 over - crossings and the bottom strand will always be part of 2 under - crossings . without creating more crossing , performing a series of reidemeister moves on",
