    "the origin of the structure in the universe is due to the primordial density perturbations that already existed when cosmological scales started entering the horizon after the final reheating .",
    "inflation can generate the primary source of the cosmological perturbation , which is usually the vacuum fluctuation of a light scalar field . in the original inflation model the primary perturbation of the light field ( i.e , the inflaton perturbation ) is converted into the curvature perturbation at the same time when the perturbation leaves the horizon .",
    "however , later studies revealed that there are many other candidates for the mechanism of generating the curvature perturbations after inflation  @xcite .",
    "the idea of these alternatives is very simple :  given that there are many scalar fields in the particle physics model , there will be many fields displaced from their minima at the end of the primordial inflation epoch , which leads to the multicomponent universe after inflation where any kind of isocurvature perturbations can be created .",
    "then the isocurvature perturbations can source the creation of the curvature perturbations after inflation .",
    "in this paper we consider an inflating curvaton  @xcite that can lead to primordial black hole ( pbh ) formation .",
    "generation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) perturbations is separated from the pbh formation , since unification of these perturbations requires a highly model - dependent argument that is not suitable for the purpose of this paper .",
    "previously , such a unification scenario has been considered for the running - mass model or the type - iii hilltop inflation model  @xcite .",
    "pbh can also be produced from passive fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "( see also ref.@xcite . )",
    "pbh in the curvaton model has been considered in ref.@xcite in connection with the so - called `` curvaton web '' concept  @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to separate pbh formation from the original inflation scenario , so that pbh formation is liberated from the cmb conditions .",
    "note however that the seed perturbations are generated during primordial inflation .",
    "although not mandatory , the secondary inflation may solve cosmological problems of some specific models .",
    "for instance :    1 .",
    "the primordial inflation model may require e - foldings less than 60 so that the model can explain the observed cmb .",
    "the short inflation could be needed to explain the spectral index and its running , or the inflation could be short because of the fast ( rapid ) rolling .",
    "2 .   the model may predict unwanted relics after reheating .",
    "they must be diluted .",
    "3 .   the model may not have an elementary dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "then the dark matter of the universe must be explained by something other than the particles .",
    "the most optimistic scenario of the inflating curvaton is that all these `` problems '' are solved by the secondary curvaton inflation .    in the standard curvaton mechanism ,",
    "the crucial assumption is that there are two components in the universe , where one component scales like matter ( @xmath2 ) while the other is the radiation ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the inflating curvaton uses a slow - roll ( or sometimes fast - roll  @xcite ) field instead of the oscillating one , which is a natural generalization of the usual curvaton mechanism .",
    "we consider the slow- or fast - rolling curvaton ( the inflating curvaton that scales like @xmath4 ) in the presence of the radiation .",
    "then the curvature perturbation is expressed as  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 here @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8    unlike the usual curvaton mechanism , the constancy of @xmath9 requires some debate in the practical calculation , since there is no doubt that @xmath9 is time dependent when the radiation density is comparable to the curvaton density .",
    "however , after the beginning of the curvaton inflation , the ratio of the radiation decreases rapidly , and @xmath7 will soon behave like a constant . in that sense",
    "the initial quantity of @xmath9 must be calculated in the inflationary phase slightly after a few e - foldings , which however must not be later than the significant evolution of the curvature perturbation  @xcite . in this paper @xmath10",
    "is the time when the initial quantities are defined .",
    "note that in the inflating curvaton model significant evolution occurs when @xmath11 , while in the usual curvaton it occurs when @xmath12 .",
    "the significant evolution is accompanied by the significant change of the parameter @xmath13 , which will be defined later .",
    "the curvature perturbation can not evolve after @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we are assuming that the effective curvaton potential is always quadratic ( @xmath15 ) so that the ratio @xmath16 behaves like a constant after the horizon exit .",
    "thinking about the scale dependence of the perturbation , `` the initial @xmath16 measured at the horizon exit '' depends on the corresponding scale if @xmath17 is moving during the primordial inflation , and finally the distribution of @xmath16 becomes scale dependent . for the curvaton mechanism , a small @xmath17 at the horizon exit means a large perturbation @xmath18 on that scale .",
    "if the effective curvaton mass is determined by the main component of the universe , one can expect a small mass during the radiation - dominated epoch  @xcite . with these simple assumptions we examine the pbh formation in the generalized curvaton mechanism . with the bare mass @xmath19 ,",
    "the effective mass @xmath20 has been estimated  @xcite for the supergravity theory in the regime @xmath21 .",
    "the possible flip of the sign has been used in supersymmetric cosmology , for instance in ref.@xcite for the affleck - dine baryogenesis . here",
    "the sign may depend on the main component of the energy density ( and of course on the effective interactions ) at that moment .",

    "a similar contribution ( @xmath23 ) , may appear in the nonsupersymmetric theory of the gravity  @xcite . ]",
    "to show an illustrative scenario we consider a new inflation scenario or a type - i hilltop inflation @xcite for the inflating curvaton , in which the curvaton potential satisfies @xmath24 during the curvaton inflation  @xcite .    consider the effective potential for the inflating curvaton , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is possible . here",
    "the effective mass is determined by the main component of the universe . as is shown in fig.[fig : potential ] , we are assuming @xmath27 during the primordial inflation while @xmath28 during the curvaton inflation .",
    "hereafter we use the index `` @xmath29 '' for the primordial inflation and `` @xmath30 '' for the curvaton inflation , respectively .        in this paper",

    "at the same time the equation becomes a linear differential equation and consequently the ratio @xmath16 behaves like a constant .",
    "we are avoiding any deviation from the quadratic assumption .",
    "let us see why the ratio can bahave like a constant when the quadratic potential is assumed for the curvaton .",
    "for the simplest example , consider the equations when @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants , @xmath34 where the equation has the solution of the form @xmath35 , and the coefficient @xmath36 is given by @xmath37.\\ ] ] defining @xmath38 , we find @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of e - foldings spent after the horizon exit .",
    "for the curvaton perturbation ( @xmath41 ) , the equation of motion after the horizon exit gives  @xcite @xmath42 .",
    "we thus find @xmath43 because of the cancellation of the evolution factor .",
    "although the mass flips its sign during the evolution , one can take the initial condition every time at the beginning of the epoch to find a similar evolution factor . here",
    "the growing solution ( @xmath44 ) is possible when the mass term has the negative sign  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion gives either a fast- or slow - rolling solution when @xmath45 ( i.e , when @xmath46 ) , where the eta - parameter is defined by @xmath47 . as a consequence of the cancellation",
    ", the ratio @xmath16 behaves like a constant as far as the evolution is given by the separable function .",
    "( see also sec.[mode - ind ] . )    for the inflating curvaton model , the source of the curvature perturbation is @xmath31 , which leaves the horizon during the primordial inflation and evolves thereafter until the curvaton mechanism starts to work . at the horizon exit ,",
    "the spectrum is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the hubble parameter during the primordial inflation .",
    "since we have two inflation stages ( primordial and curvaton ) , we also need to consider the horizon exit during the curvaton inflation .",
    "indeed , ref.@xcite used the perturbation that leaves the horizon during the second inflation and explains the small - scale perturbations . ]",
    "the significant scale dependence may appear either from @xmath50 ( running potential ) or from @xmath51 .",
    "our paper complements the approach given in ref.@xcite for the running @xmath50 .",
    "] we are considering the opposite scenario , in which the perturbation that exits the horizon during the primordial inflation seeds the curvaton mechanism . the scale dependence of the perturbation is illustrated in fig.[fig : peak ] .",
    "we are focusing on the specific case in which the amplitude of the curvaton perturbation becomes strongly scale dependent due to the hubble - induced mass during the primordial inflation .",
    "for that reason we are not avoiding the @xmath52-problem of the curvaton potential .    in our scenario the seed perturbation ( the curvaton perturbation ) created during primordial inflation is highly scale dependent and it is converted into the curvature perturbation during the curvaton inflation .",
    "our scenario complements the running - mass model or the type - iii hilltop inflation model considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    , which corresponds to the scale that touches the horizon at the beginning of the curvaton inflation .",
    "in this picture the amplitude of the perturbation that leaves the horizon during the first inflation decreases during primordial inflation ( @xmath53 ) , while it increases during curvaton inflation ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the perturbation entering into the horizon during the intermediate epoch causes oscillation around its average and decreases its amplitude . in the third picture , the perturbation newly created during the curvaton inflation is not dominating the amplitude at @xmath55 . ]    for later use , we define the evolution of the perturbations as @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the time when the inflating curvaton starts to work . here",
    "the @xmath58-dependent functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the translation functions during primordial inflation ( @xmath62 for @xmath63 ) , intermediate evolution ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 ) and the second inflation ( @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of e - foldings elapsed during each inflation stage , defined for the perturbation on that scale ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "@xmath68 is defined after the perturbation leaves the horizon , and @xmath69 is defined before the inflating curvaton starts to work at @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath71 is usually negligible for the inflating curvaton .    here",
    "the inhomogeneity ( @xmath31 ) entering into the horizon can never be kept frozen even if the potential is flat .",
    "oscillation around the average ( not around the true vacuum ) starts just after the horizon entry and the amplitude is decreasing in the expanding universe . if the oscillation is sinusoidal , the evolution of the amplitude can be approximated as @xmath72 , which causes a significant reduction of the amplitude , as is illustrated in the second picture of fig.[fig : peak ] .",
    "we thus find a peak on the scale that touches the horizon at the beginning of the curvaton inflation .",
    "we are using this scale for the pbh formation .    for the pbh formation , we consider the spectrum of the source perturbation ( @xmath16 ) , focusing on the scale corresponding to the peak .",
    "the scale of the pbh satisfies @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the hubble parameter during inflation , and @xmath75 is the energy density at the reheating after each inflation stage . the reheating after the first inflation could be avoided , but for simplicity we are assuming the reheating .",
    "since the perturbation ( @xmath76 ) does not enter the horizon before the curvaton inflation , there is a bound for @xmath68 , . in the above calculation the factor @xmath77 appears because @xmath33 varies . ]",
    "@xmath78 where the scales are defined by @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "although the evolution of @xmath31 is highly nontrivial , our final result does not depend explicitly on the evolution after the horizon exit , as far as the curvaton potential is quadratic .",
    "that is because the ratio @xmath16 behaves like a constant after the horizon exit and thus the quantity evaluated just at the horizon exit is what we need for the pbh formation .",
    "therefore , we find the perturbation using @xmath16 , which is evaluated at the horizon exit  @xcite , @xmath81 where the equation of motion is approximated by @xmath82 with the coefficient @xmath83 for the fast - rolling and @xmath84 for the slow - rolling . here",

    "we have used the ratio defined by @xmath89 ( @xmath26 is assumed during the curvaton inflation ) and the obvious relations @xmath90    the pbh is formed when the perturbation with the significant density contrast ( @xmath91 ) enters the horizon . in our case",
    "the pbh formation occurs when the perturbation of the scale @xmath92 becomes accessible within the horizon .",
    "the typical mass of the pbh is given by  @xcite @xmath93 which gives @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the degrees of freedom in the radiation .",
    "let us see more details of the scenario .",
    "first , we need to check that @xmath96 at the pbh scale is dominated by the curvaton . since the creation of @xmath31 is also possible in the secondary inflation epoch , we need to compare it with the one generated during the primordial inflation . , which is ( newly ) created during curvaton inflation , must not dominate the perturbation on the pbh scale , since otherwise the curvaton mechanism is irrelevant for the pbh formation . ]",
    "we thus need the following condition at the beginning of the secondary inflation : @xmath97 which gives a rather trivial condition , @xmath98    second , since the pbh formation requires significant density contrast , we need @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the value of @xmath17 when the perturbation ( @xmath76 ) leaves the horizon",
    ". then we find @xmath101    third , @xmath96 at the cmb scale must not be dominated by the curvaton .",
    "the consistency at the cmb scale requires @xmath102    therefore , from eqs.([pbhsecond ] ) and ( [ pbhthird ] ) , we find @xmath103 this condition suggests that @xmath17 moves significantly during the primordial inflation stage .",
    "we thus find @xmath104 here the scale can be given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "note that the steep potential allows significant running of the perturbation that leads to a small @xmath107 ( heavy pbh ) . )",
    "gives only the upper bound for the perturbation .",
    "the bound gives the heaviest pbh . ]",

    "_ in ref  @xcite , only pbhs with @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be allowed to become dark matter .",
    "@xcite . ] by observing @xmath110-distortion due to the dissipation of a large density fluctuation at a small scale after the decoupling of the double - compton scattering , we will be able to check the amplitude of the small - scale fluctuation by pixie  @xcite .",
    "as an illuminating example , consider @xmath111gev , @xmath112gev and @xmath113 .",
    "these give a typical set of the supersymmetric grand unified theory ( susy - gut ) model .",
    "then we find that @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( maximum curvaton inflation ) gives @xmath116 g , or @xmath117 ( minimum curvaton inflation ) gives @xmath118 g .",

    "( note that this `` running '' is not for the pbh perturbation .",
    "we are arguing here about the possible relation between the pbh mass and the running spectral index of the cmb . )",
    "a similar argument can be applied for the pbh model , which suggests that a large @xmath124 ( i.e , small @xmath125 ) gives both a large @xmath126 and an enhanced running of the cmb spectrum .    to be more precise about the relation between the cmb spectrum and the pbh mass ,",
    "let us assume that the primordial chaotic inflation is driven by the potential @xmath127 and that it generates cmb through the conventional curvaton mechanism . in that specific model",
    "we find the spectral index @xmath128 with the running @xmath129 .",
    "for the quadratic potential ( @xmath130 ) , one will find @xmath131 from the spectral index , which can not be realized without the secondary inflation .",
    "the running of the spectral index is enhanced because of the small @xmath125 , which could be distinguished from other predictions .",
    "note that in that model the second inflation is mandatory and the condition @xmath132 gives the pbh mass @xmath133 . here",
    "eq.([mindeln ] ) , which bounds @xmath68 from below , is given by the scale of the inflating curvaton and thus it can be related to the theory beyond the standard model .",
    "for instance , the gravity - mediated susy breaking may predict the scale of the inflating curvaton at @xmath134gev and the inflating curvaton can dilute unwanted cosmological relics of the model such as the gravitino or light moduli .    for the fast - roll inflation  @xcite ,",
    "the number of e - foldings is usually expected to be smaller than 60 ( @xmath135 ) . in that sense the secondary inflation is mandatory for the scenario .",
    "also , the inflating curvaton could have a very interesting application to the rapid - roll inflation  @xcite . using the inflating curvaton",
    ", one can increase the inflation scale of this model to such an extent that gravity waves could be generated without worrying about curvature perturbation . anyway , the curvaton - like mechanism is inevitable if the primordial inflation may not generate the required cmb spectrum .",
    "if the primordial inflation is short , the mechanism must be accompanied by the secondary inflation stage , which can be used either for cmb or for short - scale perturbations . in that sense",
    "the inflating curvaton is quite important for these models that do not have enough e - foldings by themselves .",
    "there are other types of observations by which we can check the large running . if @xmath136 is larger than @xmath137 at small scales , ultra - compact mini halos ( ucmhs )",
    "can be produced , which may be checked by observing future lensing events or gamma rays due to dark matter annihilation  @xcite .",
    "the observation may help distinguish the running - mass or the type - iii hilltop inflation model from the inflating curvaton model , since in the running - mass inflation model the perturbation on the cmb scale is fixed by the usual cmb observation and therefore its tail could be observed at smaller scales , while there is no such bound in the inflating curvaton model .",
    "basically , the evolution of the perturbation before the curvaton mechanism is highly mode dependent . in order to avoid the model dependence , we considered the ratio @xmath16 , for which the model - dependent evolution cancels when the quadratic assumption is valid .",
    "any deviation from the quadratic assumption can lead to a highly mode - dependent result , which does not meet the purpose of this paper .    in our calculation",
    "the ratio @xmath138 evolves like a constant before the beginning of the curvaton mechanism .",
    "our observation is very simple : since @xmath17 and @xmath139 are sharing the same equation of motion ( when the potential is quadratic and the perturbation is beyond the horizon ) , and the equation is a linear differential equation , their ratio behaves like a constant .",
    "the typical evolution is shown in eq.([typical - eq ] ) for constant @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which gives the identical evolution factor @xmath140 for both @xmath141 and @xmath17 . the evolution is thus cancelled in the ratio .",
    "there have been many papers suggesting that the local - type non - gaussianity could prevent pbh formation  @xcite when @xmath142 .",
    "this bound could be crucial for the oscillation curvaton , since in that model one may find @xmath143 when @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , the exact non - gaussianity in the inflating curvaton scenario has been calculated in ref.@xcite , @xmath144 where the ratio is defined as @xmath145 .",
    "note that @xmath146 is negative for the hilltop potential . with the quadratic assumption we have @xmath147 here the non - gaussianity",
    "is evaluated for the pbh scale perturbation of the inflating curvaton .    unlike the oscillating curvaton , @xmath148 in the inflating curvaton",
    "does not lead to @xmath149 . for @xmath14",
    "there are cancellations in eq.([ng - eq ] ) , which finally gives @xmath150 for @xmath151 . for @xmath152",
    "there is no cancellation but eq.([ng - eq ] ) gives @xmath150 .",
    "we thus find that the sign of the non - gaussianity parameter is plausibly positive in our model .",
    "the problem of the oscillating curvaton is avoided in the inflating curvaton .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the pbh formation with the typical mass range @xmath153 is possible if the curvaton potential is flipped due to the hubble - induced mass .",
    "we have been avoiding a highly model - dependent argument , but the result suggests that the inflating curvaton can generate the pbh that could be the dark matter , and/or the pbh with the interesting scale that could be observable in future observations  @xcite .",
    "the secondary inflation stage , which has been considered in this paper , sometimes plays an important role in specific cosmological models .",
    "although it depends on the inflationary model , the spectral index can be tuned by changing @xmath125 , which usually leads to an enhanced running of the spectral index . in other cases",
    "one may expect fast-(rapid- ) rolling inflaton for the primordial inflation , which requires additional expansion . in both cases",
    "the secondary inflation is mandatory for the scenario .",
    "the inflating curvaton can also dilute unwanted cosmological relics that are produced after primordial inflation  @xcite . in the most optimistic case ,",
    "the inflating curvaton solves the above problems and at the same time it explains the dark matter of the universe .",
    "neither artificial interaction nor fine - tuning of the potential has been assumed for the mechanism .",
    "our result also suggests that the universe s many isocurvature components may naturally lead to significant short - length perturbations .",
    "even if they will not source pbh formation , they might leave an observable signal in the small - scale perturbations .",
