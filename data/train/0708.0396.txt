    "broad emission lines @xcite are a defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "they occur in agns spanning seven decades in luminosity , from the lowest luminosity seyferts to the highest luminosity quasars .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed to explain the origin of the broad emission lines , but they all have one feature in common ; that the lines are formed in the dense , @xmath0 @xmath5 to @xmath8 @xmath6 , and fast moving , @xmath0 @xmath9 km / s , gas , close to a massive black hole ( mbh ) @xcite .",
    "the models differ only in how the gas achieves it s high velocity , be it through inflow , outflow , spinning in a disk or attached to stars orbiting close to the agn . identifying the mechanisms that produce broad emission lines is of paramount importance as only then will we finally be able to understand , and exploit , the physics of the small and as yet , spatially unresolved broad emission line regions ( belrs ) in galaxies .    the main purpose of this paper is to draw attention to an important subset of agns that exhibit flat - topped broad emission line profiles which may be utilized to determine a size for the broad line region ( blr ) that heretofore has previously only been possible using reverberation mapping techniques ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate the utility of this new technique by interpreting the flat - topped broad h@xmath10 emission line profile of the liner / seyfert nucleus of m81 .    at a distance of 3.6 mpc",
    "@xcite m81 contains the nearest and best resolved low luminosity agn ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the almost face - on aspect of the host galaxy allows a clear and unobscured view of the nucleus which has been studied across the electromagnetic spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "m81 harbors a black hole ( bh ) with a mass , m@xmath11 = 7 @xmath3 10@xmath12 m@xmath2 , deduced from a two dimensional velocity map obtained with stis on the hst @xcite .",
    "the agn is identified with a uv point source at the nucleus which has a luminosity at 1500  , l@xmath13 = 5 @xmath3 10@xmath14 l@xmath2 @xcite and an x - ray ( 0.5 - 2.4 kev ) luminosity of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath15 l@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our paper is based on the premise that the broad emission lines ( bels ) are produced in a kinematically distinct and hence physically distinct region centered on the bh .",
    "therefore , the broad emission line region ( belr ) has a well defined inner radius and outer radius .",
    "since the gravitational field strength is already known in m81 , the relationship between velocity and radius may be established , given a kinematic model for the belr gas .",
    "thus , in principle , one can determine the inner and outer radii of the belr in m81 by modeling the broad emission line profiles .",
    "the layout of our paper is as follows . in section 3",
    ", we evaluate the origin of the bels seen in m81 in the context of viable models for the production of belrs in agns , namely inflow , outflow , rotating gas disks and the atmospheres of stars illuminated by the agn . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the viable models in the context of various constraints and conclude , in section 5 , that inflow provides the best explanation for the belr in m81 .",
    "we begin , however , with a review of the broad h@xmath10 emission line observed in m81 .",
    "the broad h@xmath10 emission line , measured by stis aboard the hst , has been presented previously @xcite and is shown in figure 1 for convenience . as the figure illustrates , the profile exhibits a rather unusual @xmath16flat - top@xmath16 , that is rarely seen in agns .",
    "such profiles may be produced by radiation from a spherically symmetric shell of gas in radial motion as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "single peaked emission line profiles may also be produced by accretion disks @xcite and bipolar flows @xcite .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the entire broad h@xmath10 line is redshifted by @xmath0 7  ( @xmath0 300 km / s ) with respect to the narrow h@xmath10 line .",
    "the broad line is very symmetrical and so the redshift can not be attributed to skewness in the line shape .",
    "similar redshifts have been noted for broad emission lines in other agns @xcite .",
    "we presently have no explanation for this phenomenon , and we overlook it for now , with the consequence that the velocities reported in this paper are relative to the center of the respective emission lines",
    ".    slight irregularities on the redward side of the profile , near the peak , coincide with the narrow components of the 6563  h@xmath10 line and the brighter of the two [ nii ] lines , each of which had to be subtracted to isolate the broad h@xmath10 component , as described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the blue side of the profile , however , is less susceptible to the subtraction procedure because it coincides with the fainter [ nii ] line .",
    "interestingly , the h@xmath17 line is similar in shape to the h@xmath10 emission line as noted previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distinctive @xmath16flat - top@xmath16 is thus well established for m81 .",
    "other broad emission lines are observed in m81 , as described previously by @xcite , but the balmer lines are the brightest , they are presently the best resolved spectrally and hence the easiest to model .",
    "the broad balmer lines in m81 are apparently variable .",
    "faint , widely separated @xmath16double peaks@xmath16 did appear on the wings of the balmer lines as reported previously by @xcite , but they did not appear in the more recent stis spectrum .",
    "the transient features are consistent with the disruption of a star at the tidal radius of the mbh in m81 , but the broad line itself remains to be explained .",
    "a large body of work exists addressing the origin of broad lines in luminous agns , but the problem of the formation and confinement @xcite , the excitation @xcite and the kinematics @xcite of the broad line gas remains unsolved .",
    "interestingly , broad lines also occur in low luminosity agns @xcite which presents the opportunity to examine the phenomenon from a different perspective .",
    "furthermore , rather than attempting to explain the observed properties of _ all _ low luminosity agns , we approach the problem from the point of view of examining one well studied example , namely m81 .",
    "evidence for outflow is seen in the spectra of broad absorption line quasars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the outflow model can be ruled out for m81 because the diminutive luminosity generated by the agn is simply unable to provide sufficient radiation pressure to overcome the gravitational force of the mbh as demonstrated in the following .",
    "the condition for a radiatively driven wind is given by ,    @xmath18    where m and l are the mass and luminosity respectively , interior to a radius r , c is the speed of light , and g the gravitational constant . for m81",
    ", this condition is not satisfied by six orders of magnitude , if one adopts the thompson scattering opacity @xmath19 = 0.4 @xmath20/g for a pure hydrogen gas , m@xmath11 = 7 @xmath3 10@xmath12 m@xmath2 , and a combined uv and x - ray luminosity of 5 @xmath3 10@xmath15 l@xmath2 .",
    "the disparity is simply too large to overcome even by invoking line opacities , as line driven winds are viable only for objects that radiate close to the eddington luminosity limit ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a short , @xmath21 pc , one sided radio jet @xcite is seen to emerge from the nucleus of m81 , but this is an unlikely source for the observed broad line emission as that outflow consists of a relativistic plasma .",
    "we are also able to rule out another contending theory for the production of broad emission lines in m81 , namely ionization of the extended mass loss envelopes of red giant stars orbiting close to the agn ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "stellar winds provide a natural explanation for the confinement and replenishment of the so called @xmath16broad line clouds@xmath16 , which is otherwise a major problem @xcite .",
    "however , such a model is unlikely to be the explanation for the belr in m81 , because the intensity of ionizing photons at the tidal radius is insufficient to penetrate the denser , @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath6 , region of the mass loss wind , as shown in the following .",
    "the tidal radius , r@xmath22 , for stars in synchronous rotation around a bh is given by @xmath23{^{1/3}}\\ ] ]    for a 1 m@xmath2 star of radius @xmath24 cm , in the vicinity of a 7 @xmath3 10@xmath12 m@xmath2 bh , the tidal radius corresponds to 4 x @xmath25 cm .",
    "following @xcite , and assuming plane parallel geometry , the ionizing photon flux at the tidal radius is related to the penetration depth , d , in the inverted stromgren sphere of the stellar wind by    @xmath26 d\\nu\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 = 2.6 x @xmath28 @xmath6 s@xmath29 , is the case b recombination coefficient , and h@xmath30 is the energy of an ionizing photon .    for a power law of spectral index @xmath10 ,    @xmath31    the right hand side of equation 3 integrates to    @xmath32 /   ( h \\alpha   4 \\pi r{_{tidal}}^2)\\ ] ]    the hydrogen number density , n@xmath33 , is related to the stellar mass loss rate , @xmath34 , and the wind velocity , v@xmath35 , via the equation of continuity ;    @xmath36    combining equations 3 and 6 , and evaluating the left hand integral , one finds ,    @xmath37   v_w^2 m_h^2)]^{1/3}\\ ] ]    substituting equation 7 into equation 6 , and adopting @xmath10 = 2 , h@xmath38 = 13.6 ev and h@xmath39 = 600 ev @xcite , one obtains for the number density in the wind , _",
    "n _ , at the penetration depth , _ d _ , of the ionizing photons ;    @xmath40^{2/3 } [ r{_{tidal}}/10^{15 } cm]^{-4/3 } [ v_w/10",
    "km / s]^{1/3 } [ \\dot{m}/ 10^{-5 } m{\\sun}/yr]^{-1/3 }   cm^{-3}\\ ] ]    substituting representative values for the wind velocity v@xmath35 = 10 km / s , and stellar mass loss rates of @xmath34 = 10@xmath41 m@xmath2/yr @xcite and @xmath34 = 10@xmath42 m@xmath2/yr @xcite , one finds for m81 that representative densities in the wind at the penetration depth of the ionizing photons are 30 x @xmath43 @xmath6 and 63 x @xmath43 @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thus , the density where most of the h@xmath10 emission is produced is expected to be significantly lower than the @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath6 required for the broad line region of m81 to not produce broad forbidden lines @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the densities calculated above are for stars as close to the uv source as the tidal radius permits , and assume no absorption of ionizing photons inside that volume .",
    "obviously , the penetration depths and densities will be lower for the majority of stars which are further away .",
    "plus , it is quite likely that there is gas inside the tidal radius that would attenuate the ionizing flux , thereby exacerbating the problem .",
    "an additional argument against stars is that , for m81 , the emitting envelopes would occupy such a narrow range of orbital velocities that they would be unable to reproduce the observed broad line profile .",
    "we therefore conclude that the belr in m81 is not produced by the extended mass loss envelopes of red giant stars orbiting close to the agn .",
    "the next contender for the origin of the broad emission lines is a rotating @xmath16accretion disk@xmath16 .",
    "while there has been a novel proposal @xcite to generate a single peaked profile using a disk wind , we are reluctant to adopt it as there is no _ a priori _ evidence that there is an outflowing wind in m81 .",
    "instead , the model used here involves a relativistic accretion disk developed by @xcite , and adopted later by @xcite to explain the single peaked broad line profile in the liner nucleus ngc 3065 .",
    "an illustrative fit to the broad h@xmath10 emission line in m81 , using the relativistic disk model , is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the model invokes five free parameters , a dimensionless inner radius , @xmath44 , and outer radius , @xmath45 , an inclination angle , i , an emissivity law , q , and a velocity dispersion for the gas , @xmath46 . as described previously by @xcite , the two emission peaks ; a distinguishing characteristic of disk models , may be merged into a single peak , and the profile wings made symmetric , if the disk has a large outer radius and is inclined to the line of sight .",
    "the model also incorporates a 300 km / s velocity dispersion to widen the two velocity peaks so that they merge into a reasonable representation of the flat - top profile seen in m81 .",
    "additionally , the model incorporates a q=2 emissivity law which accentuates emission from the inner regions of the disk . for a bh with a mass the same as measured for m81 ,",
    "the outer radius of the disk model , illustrated in figure 2 , is large , corresponding to @xmath0 0.8 pc .",
    "the success of the model in fitting the profile is dependent on the disk inclination .",
    "if the disk is nearly face - on , as observed for the narrow line gas @xcite , then the inner radius of the disk has to be small to achieve the necessary range of velocities at zero intensity .",
    "consequently , gravitational and transverse redshifts become discernable , with the result that the red wing becomes asymmetric , somewhat extended and unlike the observed profile .",
    "however , a disk inclination of 50 degrees is able to reproduce the shape of the m81 profile quite well as figure 2 illustrates .",
    "such a high inclination for the inner disk is supported by observations of the radio jet @xcite .",
    "thus , if the broad emission line is produced by an accretion disk , then the unresolved inner part of the disk is considerably more inclined than the larger scale disk seen in ground based and space based images .",
    "as alluded to in the introduction , a steady state spherical inflow is also able to reproduce the broad h@xmath10 emission line profile observed for m81 , and with the minimum of assumptions .",
    "the relationship between velocity and radius is determined by the mass distribution , _",
    "m(r ) _ , to be    @xmath47    where _",
    "m(r ) _ includes a point mass , representing the black hole , embedded in the center of an extended star cluster , as described previously by @xcite .",
    "the observed , radial component , of the velocity for each particle , _ i _ , is given by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the angle between the radial velocity vector and the line of sight .",
    "a broad line profile , @xmath50 , with the characteristics of the one observed in m81 may be produced by generating a histogram of velocities for a system of particles distributed randomly within a spherical volume bounded by an inner radius , @xmath51 , an outer radius , @xmath52 and a cloud number density distribution , n(r ) , such that ,    @xmath53    for a steady state flow , where @xmath34 @xmath54 _ f(r ) _ , the cloud number density distribution is determined by mass conservation to be ,    @xmath55    as described previously by @xcite , the velocity width of the @xmath16flat - top@xmath16 is determined by the outer radius , and the width at zero intensity is determined by the inner radius .",
    "thus , given a density distribution and a velocity law , one can use the profile shape to determine the physical size of the emitting region .",
    "values that reproduce the best representation of the broad h@xmath10 emission line profile , shown in figure 1 , correspond to an outer radius , @xmath52 = 1 pc , and an inner radius , @xmath51 = 0.2 pc .",
    "there are other broad lines seen in m81 , but they are fainter and were acquired with lower spectral resolution .",
    "however , two of the better examples appear in the uv ; ly@xmath10 at 1216  and mg ii at 2800  .",
    "they are reproduced in figures 3 and 4 respectively . according to @xcite ,",
    "the central depression seen in the ly@xmath10 line is likely caused by interstellar absorption and the bright central narrow line is geocoronal emission .",
    "they suggest that interstellar absorption is also responsible for the structure seen in the core of the mg ii line .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath56 of the ly@xmath10 and mg ii profiles can be reproduced using the same inflow model and yield slightly different sizes for the emitting region .",
    "for example , the ly@xmath10 emission line requires @xmath52 = 0.7 pc , and an inner radius , @xmath51 = 0.1 pc .",
    "the mg ii emission line requires @xmath52 = 0.9 pc , and an inner radius , @xmath51 = 0.35 pc .",
    "these illustrative fits are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "overall , the sizes determined for the belrs are similar .",
    "we note that the line width at the intensity of the continuum sets an upper limit on the inner radius .",
    "this is because the line may well persist below the continuum level , even though it can not be directly measured .",
    "evidently , two plausible models ; a rotating accretion disk and a spherically symmetric inflow , are able to reproduce the shape of the broad h@xmath10 emission line profile observed for m81 . in either case",
    ", the velocity law dictates that the emitting region is large ; @xmath0 0.7 to 1 pc in radius . in the context of the accretion disk model",
    ", the broad h@xmath10 emission line presumably represents the continuation of the larger scale h@xmath10 disk , seen in ground based and space based images @xcite , as it extends down into the unresolved nuclear region . on the other hand ,",
    "the interpretation of the broad h@xmath10 emission line profile in terms of a spherically symmetric inflow would represent a new phenomenon for m81 .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result to have emerged from our analysis is the large outer radius , @xmath0 1 pc , inferred for belr of m81 , regardless of whether the broad emission line is produced by an accretion disk or an inflow . with an angular diameter of 0.1@xmath57 ,",
    "the blr of m81 is on the brink of being resolved with hst .",
    "the large outer diameter inferred for the blr may explain why a @xmath16flat - top@xmath16 profile is observed in m81 , and rarely in other agns .",
    "unless the belr is resolved , the line profiles will be contaminated by the slower moving gas surrounding the belr , causing the line profiles to be peaked rather than flat .",
    "the size we infer for the belr causes m81 to not conform to the correlation between blr size and uv luminosity established for higher luminosity agns ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the correlation appears to break down for low luminosity agns , with l@xmath58 10@xmath15 l@xmath2 , which would include m81 .",
    "but the large size that we infer for the belr of m81 does make it the largest ever measured .",
    "on the other hand , there are good reasons to believe the sizes of broad line regions may have been underestimated , previously , using the reverberation mapping technique , which is most sensitive to measuring the inner radius , closest to the agn ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the size we infer for the belr in m81 is orders of magnitude larger than the range of values cited by @xcite but their estimate is based on the _ excitation parameter _ which links the excitation of the broad emission lines to the central uv source .",
    "however , as noted previously by @xcite and @xcite the nuclear uv source in m81 produces insufficient ionizing photons to explain the luminosity of the broad h@xmath10 line , by a factor of 11 according to our calculations .",
    "we find that the the central agn produces 9 x @xmath59 ionizing ph / s , integrated between 13.6 and 600 ev , assuming a @xmath60 power law , whereas excitation of the broad h@xmath10 emission line requires 1 x @xmath61 ionizing ph / s .",
    "@xcite also note that the blr does not respond to time variable x - ray emission .",
    "in our view , this provides further evidence that the central agn is not responsible for ionizing the blr gas .",
    "that the belr in m81 is so large may explain why the central agn is unable to sustain the ionization seen there .",
    "thus , the low luminosity agn in m81 is not simply a scaled down quasar .",
    "the origin of the excitation for the belr is as enigmatic as the origin of the excitation for the more extended narrow line region in m81 , discussed previously by @xcite .",
    "most likely , the gas is excited , in situ , by shocks , or by hot , and as yet undetected , pagb stars . in either case",
    ", the excitation parameter would then be completely unrelated to the central source , and hence would not yield a useful measure of the belr size .",
    "previous attempts to estimate the bh mass in m81 using the so called @xmath16virial method@xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have consistently underestimated the kinematically determined mass @xcite by factors ranging from 20 to 200 .",
    "for example , the recent formalism of @xcite , which uses the fwhm _ and _ luminosity of the broad h@xmath10 emission line , underestimates the mass of the bh in m81 by a factor of 140 . on the other hand , the bh in m81 does conform to the bh mass - bulge velocity dispersion correlation @xcite as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "this dichotomy is regarded as further evidence that the blr in m81 is very different from those studied in more luminous agns .",
    "the mass of emitting gas may be deduced from standard ( case b ) recombination theory ;    @xmath62    using an effective recombination coefficient @xmath63 = 8.6 x 10@xmath64 @xmath6 s@xmath29 , assuming a _ constant _ average density n = 10@xmath65 @xmath6 , and a luminosity l ( h@xmath66 ) = 3.7 x 10@xmath67 l@xmath2 based on the broad line flux reported in @xcite , one finds m@xmath68 = 0.05 m@xmath2 .",
    "this mass is implausibly small for an accretion disk , but can be more easily reconciled with an inflow as shown in the following .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the filling factor , @xmath69 , once the dimensions of the emitting region have been established . for a uniform density medium occupying a spherical volume of radius r ,",
    "one finds    @xmath70    again , using an effective recombination coefficient @xmath63 = 8.6 x 10@xmath64 @xmath6 s@xmath29 , assuming a _ constant _ average gas density n = 10@xmath65 @xmath6 , and a luminosity l ( h@xmath66 ) = 3.7 x 10@xmath67 l@xmath2 based on the broad line flux reported in @xcite , one finds @xmath71 @xmath0 5 x 10@xmath7 for m81 .",
    "having established the dimensions of the emitting region and the filling factor one can now calculate the mass inflow rate for the ionized gas , using the equation of continuity ;    @xmath72    the velocity at the inner radius of 0.2 pc is determined by the mass distribution to be 1764 km / s . setting the gas density in the flow to be @xmath5 @xmath6 one obtains a mass inflow rate , @xmath34 = 1 x 10@xmath1 m@xmath2/yr . if the gas density is higher , the mass inflow rate will decrease .",
    "conversely , if only a fraction of the inflowing gas is ionized , then the _ total _ mass inflow rate will , of course , be higher .",
    "a variety of models have been considered for the production of the broad h@xmath10 emission line in m81 , but by far the most straight forward model , that involves the minimum of assumptions , is the inflow model .",
    "accretion onto a compact massive object has long been suspected as the origin for the luminosity of the agn in m81 @xcite and recognizing the shape of the broad line profile may be the signature of an inflow permits us to corroborate this idea . according to the virial theorem , the maximum power , p , produced from the conversion of gravitational potential energy as material falls from a distance of 1pc , which for the purposes of this calculation is effectively at infinity , onto the event horizon of a mbh , can be expressed as    @xmath73    a lower limit to the mass inflow rate that we infer from the ionized gas , 10@xmath1 m@xmath2/yr , sets a lower limit of 4 x 10@xmath74 l@xmath2 for the power , p , which , without explaining the details , is sufficient to account for both the uv and x - ray luminosity of the agn with a conversion efficiency of power into radiative luminosity of @xmath75 14% .",
    "interestingly , the mass inflow rate that we infer is also sufficient to sustain the radio jet according to @xcite .",
    "if the broad emission lines are produced by an inflow , then one wonders how the incredibly small mass of gas in the belr , measured to be 5 x 10@xmath76 m@xmath2 , is distributed within the , by comparison , rather large emitting volume @xmath01 pc in radius .",
    "one can get an approximate estimate based on the @xmath16noise@xmath16 in the profile , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "the fact that the observed broad line profile is smoother than the model profile , which was generated using 75,000 points ( see figure 1 ) suggests that , on average , the mass of each @xmath16broad line cloud@xmath16 is @xmath77 10@xmath42 m@xmath2 .",
    "we surmise that representative masses for broad line clouds @xmath0 10@xmath78 m@xmath2 , cited previously by @xcite , are not at all unreasonable given that the observed profile in m81 is , in fact , so smooth .",
    "it is not surprising , given the small mass of gas and the very low volume filling factor , that the _ internal _ extinction is negligible to both the uv source @xcite and the gas responsible for the broad balmer lines ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the h@xmath10 profile is symmetric provides further evidence that the extinction to the belr is inconsequential ; apparently a common feature among agns ( eg . @xcite ) .",
    "we speculate that mass loss from a spherically symmetric distribution of late - type bulge stars may provide a more than adequate supply for the in - falling gas .",
    "any gas for which the vector cross product    @xmath79    where r is the radius vector and p is the linear momentum of the gas , will fall into the nucleus . calculating how much gas satisfies this identity and furthermore ,",
    "how it becomes so compressed , is beyond the scope of the present paper , but we note that only a small mass inflow rate , @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2/yr , of dense , @xmath5 @xmath6 , gas is required to explain the luminosity of the agn .",
    "we have demonstrated a new technique that has allowed us to determine the size of the broad line region ( blr ) in m81 by modeling the shape of the broad line profile using a kinematic model for the broad emission line gas .",
    "our principle conclusion is that the blr is large , @xmath0 2 pc in diameter , regardless of whether the velocity field is represented by an accretion disk or a spherically symmetric inflow .",
    "the fact that the blr in m81 is so large may explain why the agn is unable to sustain the ionization seen there .",
    "we therefore conclude that the gas responsible for the broad emission lines seen in m81 must be ionized in - situ , either by shocks , hot stars , or a combination of the two .",
    "thus , the agn in m81 is not simply a scaled down quasar .",
    "how the gas becomes so compressed as to prevent the formation of broad forbidden lines remains a mystery .",
    "nevertheless , if the gas density really is high , @xmath0 10@xmath65 @xmath6 , then the broad h@xmath10 emission line observed in the liner / seyfert nucleus of m81 is most easily understood in terms of a steady state spherically symmetric inflow , amounting to @xmath80 1 x 10@xmath1 m@xmath2/yr , which is sufficient to sustain the luminosity of the agn and the radio jet .",
    "we further speculate , based on the smoothness of the broad emission line profile , that the individual regions of dense ionized gas have masses @xmath77 10@xmath42 m@xmath2 . alternatively , if the gas density is significantly lower , then the total mass of gas increases , making the interpretation of the broad emission lines in terms of an accretion disk more amenable , but then explaining the absence of broad forbidden lines becomes a problem .",
    "thus , the gas density remains pivotal in understanding the origin of the broad emission lines seen in m81 .",

    "<S> a new model is presented which explains the origin of the broad emission lines observed in the liner / seyfert nucleus of m81 in terms of a steady state spherically symmetric inflow , amounting to @xmath01 x 10@xmath1 m@xmath2/yr , which is sufficient to explain the luminosity of the agn . </S>",
    "<S> the emitting volume has an outer radius of @xmath01 pc , making it the largest broad line region yet to be measured , and it contains a total mass of @xmath0 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath2 of dense , @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath6 , ionized gas , leading to a very low filling factor of @xmath0 5 x 10@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the blr in m81 is so large may explain why the agn is unable to sustain the ionization seen there . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the agn in m81 is not simply a scaled down quasar . </S>"
