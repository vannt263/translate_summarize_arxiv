    "recently , much attention has been paid to searches for galaxies beyond @xmath2 since such galaxies provide us insight on the galaxy formation ( e.g. , hu et al . 2002 ; kodaira et al .",
    "2003 ; stanway et al . 2004 ; ajiki et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ; taniguchi et al . 2005",
    "; see for a review taniguchi et al .",
    "moreover , there have been reports in the literature that reionization may occur close to @xmath2 ( e.g. , loeb & barkana 2001 ) and galaxies rather than qsos are believed to be the main sources of uv photons at those redshifts .",
    "based on the color selection technique , lbgs at @xmath3 can be selected from deep broad band images as galaxies with very red @xmath4 color ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2003 ; stanway et al . 2004 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , one problem in this method is that other sources also have such very red colors in @xmath4 ; very late - type stars such as l and t dwarfs and dusty galaxies at intermediate redshifts . with a very high resolution image taken with the hubble space telescope , one can reject point - source like objects that should be stars in our galaxy ( giavalisco et al . 2004 ) . however , it is impossible to make such rejections if we use imaging survey data taken with ground - based telescopes .",
    "although near infrared data are helpful in selecting real very high-@xmath0 galaxies , it seems difficult to carry out wide - field near infrared imaging surveys because near infrared cameras usually have a small field of view compared with those of optical cameras .    in the optical broad - band color selection , only two filters , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ,",
    "are used to search for high-@xmath0 galaxies ( @xmath7 ) . if we can use some other filters at wavelengths longer than 7000  , we have more useful photometric information on high-@xmath0 galaxies , providing us with a much more reliable sample of high-@xmath0 galaxy candidates . here",
    "we note that a set of intermediate - band filters ( the ia series ) whose spectral resolution is @xmath8 is available for the suprime - cam on the subaru telescope ( e.g. , taniguchi 2004 ; fujita et al .",
    "2003 ; ajiki et al . 2004",
    "; yamada et al . 2005 ; sumiya et al . 2005 ; see also hayashino et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "we here propose to use these filters to select high-@xmath0 lbgs ; the intermediate - band dropout method .",
    "this method uses an imaging data set in which deep intermediate - band imaging is available together with broad - band data .",
    "it is also required that the band pass of the intermediate - band filter is included in the wavelength coverage of one broad band filter .",
    "the merit of this new method is to distinguish both very late - type stars such as l and t dwarfs and dusty galaxies at intermediate redshift from real high-@xmath0 lbgs .",
    "the reason for this is that such interlopers do not show strong intermediate - band depression although they have very red broad band colors that are indicative of lbgs .    in this letter , in order to demonstrate that our new method is useful in finding high-@xmath0 galaxies , we present our results by using the following two intermediate - band filters ; ( 1 ) ia709 ( @xmath9 nm and fwhm @xmath10 31.8 nm ; see yamada et al .",
    "2005 ; sumiya et al .",
    "2005 ) , and ( 2 ) ia827 ( @xmath11 nm and fwhm @xmath10 34.0 nm ; see ajiki et al .",
    "first , we describe the ia709 dropout method . in this case",
    ", we use our deep imaging data taken with the three filters of @xmath12 , @xmath5 , and ia709 . in the upper panel of fig . 1",
    ", we show the transmission curve of the three filters taken from miyazaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the lower panel of fig . 1",
    ", we also show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of lbgs at @xmath13 and 5.3 that are generated by using the population synthesis model , galaxev ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) ; see appendix .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the @xmath14 and @xmath15 diagram .",
    "the left panel shows the loci for model galaxies for the e ( elliptical ) model ( red line ) , sb ( starburst ) model ( the green line ) , and the sb model with emission lines ( the blue line ; see appendix 1 ) .",
    "we also show the following stellar data points ; ( 1 ) o to m stars ( orange asterisks ) that are calculated by the seds given in gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) , and ( 2 ) m9 , l0 , and l3-l9 dwarfs ( orange crosses ) discussed in hawley et al .",
    "as shown in this panel , if we adopt a criterion of @xmath16 1.5 , we can select lbg candidates at @xmath17 to 5.2 as ia709-depressed objects , being independent of the strength of the ly@xmath18 emission .    in order to demonstrate that this ia709 dropout method works well ,",
    "we apply it to the deep imaging data obtained in the mahoroba-11 field ( yamada et al . 2004 ; sumiya et al .",
    "their survey depths ( 3@xmath19 limits in a 2@xmath20 diameter aperture ) are 28.2 ( @xmath21 ) , 27.4 ( @xmath22 ) , 27.4 ( @xmath5 ) , 25.8 ( @xmath6 ) , and 26.6 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that there are galaxies with the elliptical - like sed at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we estimate that a reddest @xmath15 color may be @xmath25 1.3 , corresponding to the color of elliptical galaxies at @xmath26 . therefore ,",
    "as noted above , we adopt the following selection criterion for ia709-dropout galaxies , @xmath27 in order to secure that our candidates are significantly detected , we also adopt @xmath28 in order to reduce any contaminations from foreground objects that are free from absorption by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , we also adopt @xmath29 by using the above three criteria , we first obtain a sample of 35 ia709-dropout objects .    as shown in fig .",
    "2 , galactic stars mostly trace the following relation : @xmath30 as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( the long dashed line ) . taking account of the scatter of colors of galactic stars , we adopt the following criterion , @xmath31 then we finally obtain a sample of 19 ia709-dropout galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "their photometric properties are summarized in table 1 . in this table , we present @xmath32 error of colors .",
    "for none of these candidates have spectroscopic redshifts been measured till now . however , since we have multi - bands ( 4 broad - bands and 7 intermediate - bands ) photometric data of these objects , we can evaluate their photometric redshifts ( the detail of our method is written in appendix 2 ) .",
    "we then find that 18 among the 19 ia709-dropout galaxies have @xmath33 4.9 to 5.2 .",
    "one object is identified as an e galaxy at @xmath34 although its real redshift is unknown .",
    "we therefore conclude that the ia709-dropout method is useful in searching for high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) galaxies within a relatively small redshift range .",
    "it is worthwhile studying whether or not we can select the above ia709 dropouts by using only broad - band photometric data . in the right panel of fig.3 , we plot 19 ia709-dropout galaxies on the @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 diagram .",
    "the left panel shows only the model loci together with the stellar data given in fig .",
    "as shown in this figure , it seems difficult to select our sample galaxies at @xmath37 solely from this diagram .",
    "next , we describe the ia827-dropout method .",
    "this idea was first discussed by fujita ( 2003 ) . in this case",
    ", we use our deep imaging data taken with filters of @xmath38 , @xmath6 , and ia827 taken with ajiki et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "4 , we show the transmission curve of the three filters taken from miyazaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 , we show seds of both a model lbg at @xmath39 , dusty starburst with @xmath40 mag at @xmath41 and the galactic t dwarf star 2mass j04151954 - 0935066 ( kirkpatrick 2003 ) .",
    "we use the starburst reddening curve of calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to calculate the sed of a dusty starburst galaxy .",
    "it is shown that lbgs at @xmath3 can be selected as an ia827 dropout . however ,",
    "neither dusty starbursts nor t dwarfs can be selected as an ia827 dropout even though they have a very red @xmath42 color . in this way",
    ", we can select lbgs at @xmath43 by using the ia827-dropout method .    in order to demonstrate that this ia827 dropout method works well ,",
    "we apply it to the optical imaging data of sdss j104433.04@xmath44012522.2 ( ajiki et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "their survey depths under a 2@xmath45 aperture and 3@xmath19 conditions ) are 26.6 ( @xmath21 ) , 26.2 ( @xmath22 ) , 25.9 ( @xmath38 ) , 25.3 ( @xmath6 ) , and 25.6 ( @xmath46 ) . in fig . 5",
    ", we show the diagram between @xmath42 and @xmath47 for galaxies found in ajiki et al .",
    "we show loci of the three types of model galaxies that are generated by the same method given in fig .",
    "we also show the data points for galactic stars ( gunn & stryker 1983 ) and l and t dwarfs ( kirkpatrick 2003 ) .    as shown in fig.5 , being independent of the strength of the ly @xmath18 emission , galaxies at @xmath48 can be identified as ia827-dropout objects . assuming again that there are no elliptical - like red galaxies at @xmath49",
    ", we estimate a reddest @xmath47 color of @xmath25 1.4 , corresponding to the color of elliptical galaxies at @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following selection criterion for ia827-dropout galaxies , @xmath50 together with @xmath51    in order to reduce any contaminations from foreground objects that are free from absorption by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , we also adopt following criteria @xmath52 by using the above three criteria , we first obtain a sample of 9 ia827-dropout objects .",
    "next , we must separate high-@xmath0 galaxies from galactic stars including l and t dwarfs . since",
    "such stars trace the following relation ,    @xmath53    we adopt the following criterion to separate lbg candidates from them , @xmath54 where the scatter of colors of stars is taken into account again .",
    "then we finally obtain a sample of 6 ia827-dropout galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are shown in fig . 5 by open boxes .",
    "their basic data are summarized in table 2 .",
    "it is noted that four among the six ia827-dropout candidates are brighter than @xmath55 .",
    "they may be too bright for such very high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "this data set is shallower in the survey depth than that of mahoroba-11 and considered to be too shallow to select convincing high - z galaxies on this occasion .",
    "therefore follow - up optical spectroscopy will be necessary to confirm their redshifts .",
    "we have demonstrated that the ia709-dropout method is useful in finding lbgs at @xmath37 .",
    "since this redshift range is relatively small , this method will be useful to isolate such lbgs in some targeted sky areas .",
    "on one hand , the ia827-dropout method is useful in finding lbgs at @xmath7 .",
    "although we often adopt a color criterion of @xmath56 1.3  1.5 to search for lbgs at @xmath7 ( e.g. , nagao et al .",
    "2004 ; stanway et al . 2004 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , this criterion is not enough to select such lbgs unambiguously because l and t dwarfs also have such very red colors .",
    "therefore , the most important merit of the ia827-dropout method is that major interlopers , l and t dwarfs , are unambiguously separated from real lbgs .",
    "the ia709 dropout method also has this method .",
    "hu et al . (",
    "2004 ) noted that laes at @xmath57 are well separated from l and t dwarfs if a proper criterion on the @xmath58 color is adopted .",
    "we also note that kakazu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed the nb816-depressed method to separate high - redshift quasars and galaxies from l and t dwarfs based on the same principle .",
    "we have shown that the use of intermediate - band filters gives a good advantage over using only broad - band data .",
    "the broad - band color selection method is useful in finding a larger number of high-@xmath0 galaxies because the survey volume is wider .",
    "however , this method suffers from contamination of objects whose broad band colors are similar to those of high-@xmath0 galaxies ; e.g. , l and t dwarfs , and dusty starburst galaxies at intermediate redshift . on one hand ,",
    "the ly@xmath18 selection method by using a narrowband filter is basically free from such contamination .",
    "further , this method enables us to find fainter high-@xmath0 galaxies than the broad - band color selection method ( e.g. , fynbo et al .",
    "however , follow - up spectroscopy is necessary to exclude strong emitters at lower redshifts .",
    "it is also noted that the survey volume is much smaller than that of the broad - band color selection .",
    "the use of an intermediate - band filter at @xmath59    together with broad band ones makes it possible to exclude contaminations from l and t dwarfs .",
    "the survey volume is wider than that based on the narrowband selection .",
    "strong ly@xmath18 emitters can be also found in a survey with an intermediate - band filter ( e.g. , fujita et al .",
    "2003 ; ajiki et al . 2004",
    "; yamada et al . 2005 ; sumiya et al .",
    "2005 ) .",

    "we would also like to thank the referee , johan fynbo , for very careful and thoughtful report .",
    "this work was financially supported in part by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology ( nos .",
    "10044052 , and 10304013 ) and jsps ( no . 15340059 ) .",
    "ma and tn are jsps fellows .",
    "we use the population synthesis model , galaxev ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) to generate model galaxy seds .",
    "the seds of local galaxies are well reproduced by models whose star - formation rate declines exponentially ( the @xmath60 model ) : i.e. , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the age of galaxy and @xmath60 is the time scale of star formation . in this study",
    ", we use @xmath63 gyr models with salpeter s initial mass function ( the power index of @xmath64 and the stellar mass range of @xmath65 ) to derive various sed types .",
    "we note that the sed templates derived by coleman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) for elliptical galaxies , sbc , scd , irr , and sb , correspond to those using @xmath668 , 4 , 3 , 2 , and 1 gyr , respectively . in this paper , we therefore called seds with age of @xmath668 , 4 , 3 , 2 , and 1 gyr ell type , sbc type , scd type , irr type , and sb type , respectively . some of high - redshift galaxies show strong ly@xmath18 emission line , which may modify the observed colors of galaxies . in order to include possible emission - line fluxes into our models",
    ", we calculate the number of ionizing photons , @xmath67 , from the sed which is calculated from the above population synthesis model",
    ". then we can estimate h@xmath68 luminosity , @xmath69(h@xmath68 ) , using the following formula ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) ,    @xmath70    other strong emission - line luminosities , such as for [ o ii ] , [ o iii ] , h@xmath18 , and so on , are estimated by typical line ratios relative to h@xmath68 ( pegase : fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) .",

    "we treated the above factors in the following way .    the sed model of galaxies is written in appendix 1 .",
    "we adopted the dust extinction curve for starburst galaxies determined by calzetti et al .",
