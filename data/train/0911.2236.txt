    "observations over the last few decades have suggested that galaxies are embedded in an extended , diffuse halo of dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which contributes up to 95 percent of the total mass @xcite .",
    "because of the overwhelming fraction of dark matter , numerical simulations dealing with the formation and assembly of galaxy mass often focus on dark matter alone ( e.g. , the via lactea simulation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these simulations have made very specific predictions about the overall profile of galaxy - sized mass distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , when compared to observations , these simulations often fail to accurately recreate the observed shape of galaxy mass profiles @xcite .",
    "this disagreement is attributed largely to the complex physics of baryon interaction ( e.g. frictional dissipation and radiative cooling ) which is still not well understood and is difficult to model .",
    "there are many possible methods capable of measuring the distribution of matter on small ( @xmath14 1 mpc ) scales , and techniques used for characterizing a radial mass profile include measuring the rotation curves from planetary nebulae @xcite , kinematics of stellar populations @xcite and gas @xcite , or the temperature of x - ray emitting gas @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use a powerful alternative technique : gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the power of lensing is due to the fact that the technique is able to directly trace the total mass ( luminous + non - luminous ) enclosed within a given radius without needing to make any assumptions about the dynamical state of the mass in question .",
    "in addition , lensing does not rely on the presence of kinematic tracers , which are often only visible in very low - redshift galaxies , and even then are typically not present in the outer halo regions where dark matter dominates .",
    "furthermore , since we analyze a sample of strong lenses , we are able to combine the mass constraints determined from both strong lensing and weak lensing .",
    "this allows us to probe the total mass distribution over a much wider range of physical distances than by using weak lensing alone , and also allows us to constrain the properties of stellar mass distribution without selecting a specific stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "instead , we rely on directly - derived properties : lensing - inferred mass and total luminosity ( although we do make an assumption about the shape of the dark matter halo ) .    for early - type galaxies , several lensing - based studies have shown the typical shape of the mass density profile to be consistent with an isothermal ( @xmath15 ) model , given the uncertainties on the measurements , between distances of @xmath16 kpc @xcite . however , due to the low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) on the lensing signal obtained from an individual galaxy , these studies rely on stacking a large number of galaxies into a single sample to determine the average profile of the entire stack .",
    "for this work , we utilize deep imaging from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . in general",
    ", space - based data will have a much higher density of background galaxies ( @xmath17 ) when compared to data taken from the ground over an identical exposure time .",
    "this increased background density count not only enables us to detect a weak lensing signal much closer to the center of the lensing galaxy , but also allows for a significant detection with fewer stacked galaxies ( @xmath18 ) , because the expected weak lensing snr scales as @xmath19 .",
    "the ability to work on a small sample size is particularly useful , given the relative paucity of known strong lenses at all redshifts .    in this work ,",
    "we are able to extend the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g07 ) , who conducted a similar mass profile study on a small ( 22 lens ) sample of low redshift ( z @xmath0 0.2 ) early - type strong gravitational lenses collected from the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) over a wide range of physical distances ( @xmath20 kpc ) . from this work",
    ", it was shown that , like their non lensing counterparts , the total mass density profile of strong lensing ellipticals could be described by a roughly isothermal model ( although they note that the comparison between the data and the model was done without a formal fit ) .",
    "this was thought to be due to the combination of baryonic and dark matter , the so - called bulge - halo conspiracy , in which a relatively steep luminous matter profile and a shallower dark matter profile combine in such a way that the total mass distribution of the galaxy can be well approximated by an isothermal model @xcite . by comparing this data set to our moderate redshift sample",
    ", we thus explore the evolutionary trends of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe our lens sample , the lens selection criteria , and the data reduction pipeline used for this work . at this point",
    ", the interested reader may turn to the appendix , where we describe our techniques for analyzing weak lensing shear , paying specific attention to signal to noise optimization and the removal of systematic errors . in section 3 ,",
    "we use a two - component model to determine the contributions of the stellar and dark matter components to the total profile .",
    "we present all of our results in section 4 , the reader interested in the science may skip directly to this section .",
    "we discuss the results and compare them to the slacs results in section 5 , looking for evolutionary differences between the samples .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 6 .    throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath21 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "all magnitudes presented in this paper are ab magnitudes .",
    "for this analysis , we focus on a sample of 41 strong gravitational lenses at moderate redshift ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "a majority of the sample was observed as part of the castles program , but it also contains lenses found in the cosmos survey @xcite and the extended groth strip @xcite , as well as targeted exposures of individual lens systems . unlike other data sets that have been selected in some uniform way ( such as the slacs lenses ) , our lens sample is drawn from a variety of sources and selected simply for being lenses with early - type morphologies in the desired redshift range .",
    "however , we do note that systems known to be strongly affected by the presence of a galaxy cluster ( q0957 + 561 , sdss1004 + 4112 , and b2108 + 213 ) were excluded from the sample .",

    "we begin our process of modeling stellar light by using galfit @xcite to fit a de vaucouleurs profile @xcite to the f814w images of each strong lensing galaxy , carefully masking out any contaminating light from nearby satellites or ( more importantly ) the strongly lensed images . in most cases ,",
    "this masking is achieved by running galfit on a small cutout of the galaxy ( typically a square 2.5 times the galaxy s ` fwhm ` parameter  as determined by sextractor  on a side ) .",

    "this has been done not only to take advantage of the analytic form of the dark matter shear profile described in @xcite , but also to compare our results to the numerous previous studies that have assumed nfw dark matter profiles as well ( e.g. @xcite ; g07 ) .",
    "recently however , studies have shown that lensing data actually favor a dark matter profile with a slightly modified inner slope ( @xmath171 ) , often motivated by some physical process such as adiabatic contraction ( ac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that affects the regions of a galaxy where @xmath172 @xcite . because this modification only alters the distribution of the dark matter on small ( @xmath173 kpc ) scales for galaxy - scale masses , the total dark matter mass and virial @xmath39 ratio derived from these new profiles remain statistically consistent with the original nfw model . however , this is not the case for the derived stellar @xmath39 ratio ( @xmath174 ) , as even a change in @xmath171 on the order of a few percent can significantly impact @xmath174 , and hence the inferred stellar mass .    to gauge the systematic impact of altering @xmath171 on our data ,",
    "we rerun the two - component stellar+dark matter analysis described in  3 , replacing the standard nfw profile with a generalized nfw ( gnfw ) profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath175 that is similarly projected into 2-dimensions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "while this prescription is somewhat different than applying an ac model to a galaxy ( ac also modifies the concentration parameter , whereas altering the gnfw slope does not ) , the effect on the halo s inner slope can be comparable : @xcite have demonstrated that , assuming an initial nfw dark matter halo with a distribution of baryons that condenses to form an elliptical galaxy , the final inner slope of the dark matter halo ranges between @xmath176 and @xmath177 .    to be conservative , we vary @xmath171 between 0.1 and 1.5 , measuring the best - fit v - band stellar @xmath39 ratio ( @xmath50 ) for each case .",
    "the results can be seen in figure [ fig : mlstar ] .",
    "we find that the best - fit @xmath50 is strongly dependent on @xmath171 , suggesting a degeneracy between these two parameters that affects stellar mass in the expected way : an increase in dark matter fraction in the core of the galaxy ( characterized by a steeper inner slope ) results in a smaller fraction of stellar mass ( characterized by a lower stellar @xmath39 ratio ) .    assuming a fiducial uncertainty on @xmath171 of 20% , the variation in @xmath171 corresponds to a range in stellar @xmath39 ratio of @xmath178 . adding this systematic uncertainty to our previous estimate of statistical error yields ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "as a comparison , @xcite measure a @xmath030% decrease in stellar @xmath39 ratio by including the @xcite ac model on a subsample of lower - redshift strong lenses , in good agreement with the results we see when we increase the inner slope of the nfw profile by @xmath020% .      by using a cmr to reduce the number of free parameters in our model fitting routine",
    ", we are explicitly coupling the best - fit mass to the observed shape of the mass density profile .",
    "if instead we were to make different assumptions about the cmr , this would lead to different best - fit mass values , which ultimately would yield systematically different stellar and virial @xmath39 ratios . while we , like g07 , have assumed the @xcite cmr ( equation ( [ eqn : numc ] ) ) in our analysis , recent work involving higher resolution numerical simulations @xcite have argued for an alternative cmr that is less sensitive to halo mass and evolves more slowly with redshift .",
    "in particular , using the cosmological parameters from the wmap 5-year data set , @xcite determine a cmr of the form : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the hubble parameter . comparing these cmrs for galaxies with total mass of the order of our sample ( @xmath182 )",
    ", we find that the @xcite cmr yields a concentration parameter that is @xmath183 smaller than the @xcite cmr at redshift @xmath184 , but ( because of the slower evolution with redshift ) actually becomes @xmath185 larger than the @xcite cmr at @xmath151 , the median redshift of our sample .",
    "re - running our initial de vaucouleurs + nfw model fit with this new cmr , we find that the best fit @xmath72 and @xmath50 parameters vary by approximately 10% and 5% respectively , which is much less than the statistical uncertainties presented in  4 .",
    "in addition to completely modifying the cmr , we also investigate systematics associated with the intrinsic scatter of the relation itself . including the 1-@xmath2 errors , @xcite measure a @xmath186 variation in halo concentrations for their sample of @xmath187 halos , which we incorporate into our analysis . specifically , assuming an extreme case where we increase the concentration parameter of each galaxy in our sample by @xmath186 ( and the alternative case where we decrease each halo by @xmath186 ) , we measure variations in @xmath72 and @xmath50 of 25% and 15% respectively . adding these uncertainties in quadrature with the uncertainties associated with our choice of cmr , we therefore include an additional @xmath183 and @xmath188 uncertainty on our best - fit stellar and virial @xmath39 ratios due to the systematics of the cmr .      ultimately , by investigating modifications to both the inner slope and concentration parameter of the dark matter halo , we believe that we are able to characterize the potential impact of important systematics on our results , enabling us to propagate these uncertainties to all other measured quantities that depend on them . in particular , we find a total systematic uncertainty of @xmath189 on our best - fit @xmath50 ( dominated by the systematics of the dark matter inner slope ) and a @xmath188 uncertainty on our best - fit @xmath72 , which subsequently correspond to @xmath189 and @xmath188 uncertainties on our derived stellar and virial masses . propagating these uncertainties to the other derived parameters , we measure a @xmath186 systematic uncertainty on both the mass ratio ( @xmath161 ) , and stellar baryon fraction @xmath127 .",
    "taking advantage of the large density of background galaxies obtained by relatively short ( @xmath190 sec ) acs exposures , we present the results of a joint weak and strong lensing analysis of a sample of 41 massive elliptical galaxies at moderate ( @xmath191 ) redshift , determining the mass overdensity profile over nearly 3 orders of magnitude in physical radius . using a 2-component de vaucouleurs + nfw profile model , we are able to determine stellar and virial @xmath39 ratios for the sample , and disentangle the relative contributions of stellar and dark matter from the total mass budget .",
    "furthermore , we compare all of our results to those obtained from a subset of the lower redshift slacs sample ( @xmath159 ) , placing constraints on the evolution of these mass properties over cosmic time .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * we present new redshift information for 7 cosmos lenses : we find lens redshifts for j095930.93 + 023427.7 , 0038 + 4133 , j100140.12 + 020040.9 , 0211 + 1139 , and 0216 + 2955 , a source redshift for 0056 + 1226 , and both lens and source redshifts for 0254 + 1430 . *",
    "the mass overdensity profile of our sample has a best - fit power - law profile of @xmath113 and is consistent with an isothermal model between @xmath0 10 @xmath144 kpc and @xmath0 1000 @xmath144 kpc . *",
    "the best - fit stellar and virial @xmath39 ratios for our lens sample are given by @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively . *",
    "given our average sample luminosity of @xmath194 , we find an average virial mass of @xmath195 and an average stellar mass of @xmath196 .",
    "* we find an average mass ratio of @xmath197 , which is consistent with the lower - redshift slacs sample ratio of @xmath198 . * using our assumed cosmology ,",
    "we convert mass fraction into a stellar baryon fraction , finding that @xmath199 .",
    "this result indicates a low stellar formation efficiency in early - type galaxies , in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "* by comparing our mass fraction data to the lower - redshift slacs sample , we are able to place constraints on the evolution of the virial to stellar mass fraction of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "we find that the quantity evolves as @xmath200/@xmath201 = @xmath202 over the last @xmath0 7 gigayears .",
    "this is the first such study to place constraints on the evolution of @xmath69/@xmath203 without invoking a specific imf .",
    "overall , these results show that our method is a promising new technique : with only a small sample of lenses ( 41 systems ) , were are able to significantly measure the average mass overdensity profile and mass - to - light ratios of the sample , allowing us to place constraints on the mass evolution of early - type galaxies from @xmath204 to @xmath205 . as always though",
    ", this work can be strengthened by increasing the sample size . while galaxy - scale strong lenses are relatively rare today ( @xmath0 100 systems ) , future large - scale observational surveys such as lsst ( @xmath0 10000 new lenses ) and jdem ( @xmath0 10000 new lenses ; * ? ? ? * ) are expected to dramatically increase the number of known strong lenses . including these new lenses in future work",
    "will greatly reduce the size of our present statistical uncertainties .    in the near future",
    "however , we plan to increase our lens sample by including other known deep space - based lens data from castles that have been imaged using the smaller hst wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . though the smaller area will limit our ability to probe out to the large radii made available with the acs sample , the longer exposure times for the wfpc2 data yield background densities that are comparable to those in the acs sample , allowing us to place better constraints on the inner mass overdensity profile by incorporating these galaxies into our current lens sample .",
    "we will also take advantage of the haggles strong - lens search of bright red galaxies @xcite which is expected to explore the whole of the hst acs archive , discovering @xmath0 10 lenses per square degree of coverage .",
    "we plan to further augment this study by combining our acs sample with the full ( @xmath0 40 ) long - exposure slacs sample , which will allow us to probe the differences in the mass properties of strong lenses across a wider variety of samples and categories , such as morphology , luminosity , and finer redshift slices .",
    "we are particularly interested in segregating the lens sample by total luminosity , since the slacs lenses appear to be more luminous than their moderate - redshift counterparts when passively evolved to @xmath184 ( figure [ fig : mlum ] ) , suggesting that the slacs sample may have evolved from a slightly different population of galaxies .    of course",
    ", by increasing the sample size of lenses and thus reducing the statistical errors associated with these measurements , correcting systematic uncertainties will become much more important . in future studies we hope to improve our control of systematics in several ways .",
    "foremost is the ability to measure accurate redshifts for both the lens and source galaxies of strong lens systems , as these measurements are crucial for accurate lens modeling . while some future survey instruments should provide redshift information ( either spectroscopically or photometrically ) as part of their normal operation , it is still important to improve the redshift information for currently known lenses , and we plan to obtain more spectroscopic and photometric redshift data in the near future .",
    "additional systematics controls could come in the form of improved profile modeling , relaxing the strict de vaucoulers + nfw mass profiles in favor of a more general free - index srsic profile for the stellar mass and a freely - varying gnfw profile for the dark matter .",
    "similarly , improved strong lens mass modeling should be utilized in the future , increasing our ability to distinguish between various mass profiles at very small scales , as well as improving the precision of our stellar mass fraction measurements .",
    "finally , we could improve galaxy selection and weak lensing measurements by using hst data obtained through other filters , allowing us to determine photometric redshifts for many of the background source galaxies .",
    "we note however that this should not be a dominant source of systematic error , as we have shown previously that altering the background galaxy redshift distribution does not significantly change the results of any of our fitted parameters .",

    "this study utilizes the imcatkaiser / imcat/ ] software suite , which is based on the well - known algorithm of kaiser , squires , & broadhurst ( 1995 , hereafter ksb ) , as well as a series of perl and python scripts which apply the psf correction scheme of @xcite and mass profile analysis of g07 . using both the catalogs and their associated science images , our pipeline first invokes the imcat object detection program _",
    "hfindpeaks _ on the images and cross - correlates the results with the related sextractor catalogs , in order to reduce the number of false detections .",
    "objects detected in both sextractor and _ hfindpeaks _ are convolved with a gaussian smoothing kernel in order to regularize their shapes and sizes and also to reduce shape noise ; the width of an object s smoothing kernel ( @xmath206 ) is given by the object s half light radius as determined by sextractor .",
    "once an object has been smoothed , the local sky background is calculated and subtracted from its overall intensity .",
    "after background subtraction , the object s magnitude is determined using a magnitude zero point taken from the acs website .",
    "finally , the script determines a centroid for each object , and calculates the quadrupole moments of intensity , given by @xmath207 where the integral is taken from the centroid location to @xmath208 . here",
    ", @xmath209 represents the intensity of an object in a given pixel , and @xmath210 is a weight function , which for this study is a circular gaussian with radius @xmath206 , matching the filter used for object detection .",
    "these moments of intensity are then used to calculate `` ellipticity polarizations '' : @xmath211 which represent the components of the observed shape of the object .",
    "in addition , the `` smear '' and `` shear '' polarizability pseudo - tensors ( @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively ; see e.g. ksb , or the updated definitions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also calculated , which are used to correct shape measurement errors due to psf distortion .",
    "before we analyze the weak lensing signal , we must correct for any systematic distortions of the galaxy shapes .",
    "the first such systematic that we address is distortion due to the degradation of charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) of the acs ccds .",
    "defects that arise during the lifetime of the ccd can cause some charge to be delayed and transferred to other pixels , resulting in a trail of charge following an object . in the acs ,",
    "the readout direction is vertical .",
    "thus , this trail will induce a spurious stretching in the @xmath214 direction .",
    "since cte degradation alters the shapes of galaxies in the same direction , the effect can mimic the gravitational shear signal caused by weak lensing .",
    "the spurious polarization induced by cte degradation is typically on the order of 1% , and therefore it most strongly affects the outer regions of a galaxy - galaxy shear profile ( where the gravitational shear drops below 1% ) . if left uncorrected , this spurious signal can alter the inferred total mass of the galaxy .",
    "the `` strength '' of an object s tail is affected by several factors , including object brightness , size , and location along the ccd readout path .",
    "this makes for an inherently non - linear problem that can not be corrected by a simple model .",
    "instead , we use the empirical prescription of @xcite devised for the cosmos program . following g07 , we modify the original equation to be compatible to our data , although we use a slightly different prefactor which accounts for combining the imcat definition of snr with the sextractor measured half - light radius ( g07 obtain both parameters from imcat , whereas @xcite use sextractor exclusively ) : @xmath215 which modifies the @xmath216 component of each object in a catalog . in this equation",
    ", @xmath217 represents the half - light radius of the object ( as determined by imcat ) , and @xmath218 is the normalized y - coordinate of the object ( equal to 0 at the bottom of an acs field and 1 at the top ) , defined such that the correction for the cte degradation is maximized near the acs chip gap ( @xmath219 ) , where the pixels are the farthest away from the readout registers .",
    "the time - dependent factor takes into account the fact that the effects of cte degradation have steadily worsened over the lifetime of the acs .",
    "figure [ fig : cte ] shows the effect of cte correction on our data sample , and from the figure we can see that the average corrected galaxy shape ( @xmath220 ) is no longer spatially dependent , and is very nearly zero throughout the entire field .",
    "in addition , our cte correction scheme is able to correct specifically chosen subsets of the galaxy population as well : after separating the source galaxies into three distinct magnitude bins ( m @xmath14 25 ; 25 @xmath14 m @xmath14 26 ; m @xmath221 26 ) , we find that the cte - corrected galaxies in each bin show a mean shape @xmath222 , again with no spatial dependence across the field .",
    "to test the systematics associated with our cte correction scheme , we apply an additional 20% cte shape correction to every background galaxy , regardless of size , brightness , or position on the detector .",
    "we perform a full weak lensing analysis and 2-component model - fit (  3 ) on these data , and find that the best - fit stellar and virial @xmath39 ratios systematically vary from the values inferred from the original data ( presented in  4 ) by @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively , which are much smaller than the presented statistical errors .",
    "we next perform a psf correction to remove any shape distortions of the background galaxies due to the telescope , leaving only those distortions caused by gravitational shear .",
    "our correction scheme applies the method of @xcite , which utilizes the ksb formalism along with modifications developed by @xcite and @xcite .    while it should be possible to map the spatial variations of the psf by directly measuring the shapes of the stars found in the data",
    ", we find that this is not the case for our lens sample , as there are too few stars per exposure to accurately sample the whole field .",
    "instead , to increase our star count we use a series of well - sampled , low galactic latitude stellar field exposures to generate a series of polynomial psf models .",
    "there is some concern in fitting a model psf to our data instead of deriving it empirically , as the acs psf is temporally variable .",
    "however , this variability is primarily a function of a single parameter : changes in the separation of the primary and secondary hst mirrors due to thermal breathing @xcite . by using a total of 181 exposures taken over the course of several months , our stellar - field psf models span a wide range of mirror separations , allowing us to compile a nearly continuous database of varying psf patterns that can be used to correct our science images .    to create each model",
    ", we measure the anisotropy components ( @xmath225 ) and polarization tensor ratio ( @xmath226 )  a parameter required for psf correction that is related to the psf width  as a function of position , using the stars in a given stellar field .",
    "the measured quantities are given by : @xmath227}{\\rm{tr}\\left[p^{sm*}\\right ] \\label{eqn : psf_size}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 are the measured stellar ellipticity components , and @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the stars shear and smear polarization tensors , respectively .",
    "model stars are initially selected by simple cuts in size - magnitude space .",
    "a 0.8 pixel wide cut in half - light radius , centered on the stellar locus , is used to separate stars from galaxies .",
    "a bright - end magnitude cut is used to remove stars with saturated pixels and a snr cut is used to remove stars that are too noisy to be accurately measured . from this initial star selection we generate 3rd - order polynomial models for the @xmath231 components , and a 5th - order polynomial model for @xmath226 . to improve the model",
    ", we evaluate each polynomial component at the coordinates of the stars , and compare the inferred values to the actual measured quantities .",
    "if , for any given model component , the observed value disagrees with the model by more than 2-@xmath2 , the star is considered an outlier ( because of shape noise ) and is removed from the sample .",
    "once all outliers are removed , we regenerate the polynomial models with the remaining stars .",
    "this process is repeated iteratively until the number of stars remains stable , at which point we generate a final set of polynomials that represent the final psf model for that stellar field .    for each science exposure , we compare the measured psf of each star in the field to the model psfs , and determine the best - fit model by calculating the reduced @xmath75 statistic given by : @xmath232 ^ 2}{\\rm{n_{stars } } } \\label{eqn : chisq}\\ ] ] where @xmath233 is the measured psf of star @xmath93 , and @xmath234 is the model psf of stellar template @xmath82 , evaluated at the location @xmath235 of the real star .",
    "once best - fit psf models are determined for all exposures associated with a composite science image , the coordinates of each model are registered to the science image , and the models are combined by an exposure - time weighted average to create a final `` master '' psf model used to correct each background galaxy , given by : @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the exposure time of a given exposure in the composite science image , and @xmath238 is equal to 1 if the galaxy falls within the boundaries of the wfc chips in the exposure ( not always true , due to dithering ) , and 0 otherwise .    as a test of our psf correction ,",
    "we plot the shapes of all stars found in our science images , both pre- and post - correction , ( figure [ fig : psf ] ) .",
    "we do see an improvement : the stellar ellipticity components become more circular ( @xmath239 , @xmath240 ; @xmath241 , @xmath242 ) , and show a mild reduction in spread ( @xmath243 , @xmath244 ; @xmath245,@xmath246 ) . by taking into account effects due to the psf ( and effects due to cte degradation in the previous section ) we are able to significantly reduce the dominant sources of systematic error involved in the weak lensing analysis .      to improve the overall signal",
    ", we apply a series of data cuts to our master catalog .",
    "first , we exclude objects that have a half - light radius smaller than 3 pixels , as many of these objects are `` bad '' data objects such as stars or cosmic rays , which are not affected by gravitational shear and only serve to dilute the overall shear signal . we also reject objects with a half - light radius larger than 14 pixels , and `` bright '' objects ( @xmath247 ) , as these objects are likely to be foreground interlopers .",
    "additionally , we apply a conservative cut to galaxy shapes , rejecting any object with @xmath248 ( where the @xmath249 are the cte + psf corrected ellipticity components ) as being unphysical or poorly shape - corrected in some way .",
    "finally , we apply a general snr cut to the data , rejecting any remaining object with an imcat significance ( @xmath250 ) parameter less than 16 ; ( as a comparison , this corresponds to an snr @xmath14 4 cut using the snr determination of @xcite ) . after cutting the data ,",
    "we are left with a total background galaxy density of @xmath251 galaxies arcmin@xmath252 ( as compared to the @xmath253 galaxies arcmin@xmath252 measured prior to cutting ) which is high enough to measure the weak lensing signal around the galaxy stack .      after correcting for psf and cte effects for objects in an individual science field",
    ", we can apply the standard weak lensing formalism ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the field and determine an average mass profile from a stack of fields .    to properly combine each lens field into a cohesive stack , we first apply a shift to the coordinates of each science field , such that the origin in each field corresponds to the location of the strong lens system . because the lenses in our sample cover a range of redshifts , we convert each background galaxy s angular separation from the lens to a physical one , so that we can more easily stack galaxy fields together in catalog space .",
    "finally , once all objects have been repositioned in terms of physical distances relative to a common center , we combine everything into a master galaxy catalog that contains information on galaxy position and corrected ellipticity , and information on the strong lens field from which it was initially drawn .",
    "in addition , geometric information about the strong lenses themselves are also included , which are critical in determining the physical mass profile at small scales .",
    "since our master galaxy catalog contains information on both position and corrected ellipticity , we can combine these parameters to develop two radial shear profiles : a tangential `` e - mode '' profile given by : @xmath254 and a 45@xmath255 rotated `` b - mode '' profile , given by : @xmath256 where @xmath257 refers to the number of galaxies located within a radial bin centered at radius @xmath258 and @xmath259 and @xmath260 represent the shear components of galaxy @xmath93 , equivalent to the components of reduced shear ( @xmath249 ) in the limit of weak lensing .",
    "we calculate @xmath261 and @xmath262 in concentric circular annuli around the common center of our stacked lens sample . for a system with a single lens plane ( or a stacked , coincident lens plane ) the lensing signal measured with respect to the center of mass and averaged over all background galaxies",
    "should be contained entirely within the e - mode profile while the b - mode should vanish .",
    "thus , by computing these two shear profiles , we can see information regarding the radial characteristics of the shear field from @xmath263 , as well as a check on systematic errors from @xmath264 .",
    "next , we convert shear into a differential surface mass overdensity , @xmath74 , by scaling the tangential shear profile by the critical lensing density @xmath83 : @xmath265 a measurement of surface mass density that encodes the angular diameter distances between the observer and the lens ( @xmath266 ) , the observer and the source ( @xmath267 ) , and the lens and the source ( @xmath268 ) . the @xmath34 profile is thus given by : @xmath269 where @xmath270 represents the average surface mass density enclosed within projected radius r. since @xmath83 is a function of both lens and source redshifts ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively ) , in principle we must construct a unique @xmath271 for every source galaxy that is used in the mass overdensity profile .",
    "in practice , however , this is impractical since a large number of background galaxies do not have measured redshifts . instead , as in g07 , we define an average critical density for each lens field : @xmath272 \\label{eqn : avscrit}\\ ] ] where @xmath273 is a weighted factor of ( @xmath267/@xmath268 ) , designed to fully account for background source redshift distribution",
    ". it is given by : @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the redshift distribution of background source galaxies . since our image exposure times and data cuts",
    "are similar to g07 we use their redshift distribution , extrapolated from cosmos : @xmath276 with @xmath277 = 0.345 , @xmath278 = 3.89 , and @xmath279 = 1 . from these parameters ,",
    "we calculate a mean background source redshift of @xmath280 .",
    "a full list of @xmath273 parameters can be seen in table  [ tbl : lens ] .",
    "we next compute an estimator of @xmath34 : @xmath281}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{l=1}^{n_{\\rm lens } } \\left[\\sigma'^{-2}_{{\\rm crit},l}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{{\\rm source},l}}\\sigma_{e , i}^{-2}\\right ] } \\label{eqn : massest}\\ ] ] where @xmath282 is the number of background galaxies associated with lens field @xmath283 , @xmath284 is the average critical density for lens field @xmath283 , and @xmath285 is the uncertainty assigned to the tangential shear estimate of galaxy @xmath93 , which we take to be the shape uncertainty as defined in @xcite to be proportional to a galaxy s shape measurement error added in quadrature with the intrinsic shape noise of all galaxies ( @xmath286 ) to prevent over - weighting . with this conversion ,",
    "we are able to transform shear to mass , and develop a mass overdensity profile for our data .    as a check on the systematics of our assumed redshift distribution , we vary the parameters of the distribution , calculating a unique set of \\{@xmath287 } parameters for each lens field .",
    "we do this by measuring the observed f814w magnitude distribution of the galaxies in the field and convert this to a redshift distribution , using the method described in @xcite . after doing this",
    ", we recalculate the @xmath288 , @xmath273 , and @xmath34 estimator values for the entire sample , and repeat the weak lensing analysis with these updated values .",
    "we find that , regardless of the choice of redshift distribution parameters , the best - fit model parameters determined here ( as well as those described in  3 ) vary by @xmath289 . since this is smaller than the statistical uncertainty of our measurements , we conclude that uncertainties in the redshift distribution are negligible for our purposes ."
