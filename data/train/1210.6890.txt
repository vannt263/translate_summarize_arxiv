    "non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most compelling problems of modern cosmology . despite the fact that its existence is well established by cosmological and astrophysical probes ,",
    "its nature remains elusive .",
    "still , observations can constraint the properties of dark matter and give some hints about its identity .",
    "one of the fundamental requirements for a viable dark matter candidate is the stability over cosmological times .",
    "this stability could be due to the existence of a symmetry protecting or suppressing its decay .",
    "it has been shown recently that such symmetry can be related to the flavor structure of the standard model  @xcite . the model proposed in  @xcite",
    "is based on a @xmath0 symmetry with four @xmath1 higgs doublets .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath0 ( even permutation of four objects ) group is spontaneously broken into a @xmath2 subgroup which is responsible for the dm stability . the leptonic sector is also extended .",
    "it consist in four right handed neutrinos and the light neutrino masses are generated through the type - i seesaw mechanism and obey an inverted hierarchy mass spectrum with @xmath3 and vanishing reactor angle @xmath4 .",
    "we have also been consider models with a different matter content for the right handed neutrinos with the same dm stability mechanism but with different neutrino phenomenology  @xcite or a model based on the dihedral group @xmath5 where the some flavor changing neutral currents are present and constraint the dm sector  @xcite .",
    "there are some models based on flavor symmetries but with decaying dm have also been considered , see for instance  @xcite . for a model with non - abelian flavor symmetries with stable dm but where the the dm couples to some right handed neutrinos in a similar way to our model where the dm and some right handed neutrinos are charged under this symmetry .",
    "] see  @xcite .",
    "the discrete dark matter ( ddm ) mechanism consist on the stability of the dark matter is by means a residual @xmath6 symmetry of a spontaneously broken discrete flavor symmetry , for instance in the original the group of even permutations of four objects was used , @xmath0 , and it was spontaneously broken by the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism into a @xmath2 sub group , @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0 group has two generators : s , and t , which obeys the properties @xmath8 .",

    "there are five @xmath21 doublets of higgs scalars : the @xmath22 is a singlet of @xmath23 , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are doublets . in order to preserve a remnant @xmath26 symmetry , the doublet @xmath27 is not allowed to take vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "lets start discussing the quark sector . in ref .",
    "@xcite quarks were considered blind under the flavor symmetry to guarantee the stability of the dm .",
    "consequently the generation of quark mixing angles was difficult , see  @xcite .",
    "a nice feature of our current model is that with @xmath23 we can assign quarks to the singlet and doublet representations as shown in table[tab2 ] , in such a way that we can fit the ckm mixing parameters .",
    "the resulting up- and down - type quark mass matrices in our model are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "note that the higgs fields @xmath22 and @xmath30 are common to the lepton and the quark sectors and in particular the parameter @xmath31 . in order to fit of all quark masses and mixings",
    "provided @xmath31 lies in the range of about @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "we turn to the leptonic sector , the charged leptons are basically equal to the up quarks under the flavor symmetry , so the charged lepton mass matrix is of the same form of the up quark mass matrix in eq .",

    "the neutrino masses are generated through the type - ii see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "for that we include in the model an @xmath33 higgs triplet scalar field @xmath34 .",
    "regarding dark matter , note that the lightest @xmath26-charged particle in @xmath35 can play the role of `` inert '' dm  @xcite , as it has no direct couplings to matter .",
    "the conceptual link between dark matter and neutrino phenomenology arises from the fact that the dm stabilizing symmetry is a remnant of the underlying flavor symmetry which accounts for the observed pattern of oscillations . choosing the vev alignment @xmath36 and @xmath37 , consistent with the minimization of the scalar potential one finds that @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "note that this matrix has two free parameters and gives us a neutrino mass sum rule of the form @xmath41 in the complex plane , which has implications for neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite , as seen in fig .",
