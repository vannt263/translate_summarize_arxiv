    "this theory has also provided a simple toy model of gauge / string correspondence @xcite and led to a new correspondence between two - cut critical points @xcite of the matrix models and type 0 superstrings @xcite . along this line ,",

    "therefore , it would be interesting to ask _ what kind of phenomena appear beyond this infinite variety of the correspondence?_. in this paper , as a first step toward this study , we quantitatively analyze the multi - cut two - matrix models and their geometries in the fractional - superstring critical points .",

    "the fractional - superstring critical points are characterized by the following form of the @xmath1-component kp lax pairs @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 with the two different choices of the leading matrix @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12 these choices of the leading matrices generally break the intrinsic @xmath0 symmetry of the multi - cut two - matrix models ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two matrices ) , symmetry . ] @xmath15 and the system requires rather non - trivial analysis as compared with the @xmath0 symmetric critical points @xcite . despite of this fact , we show that these systems turn out to be still solvable even in the presence of _ an arbitrary number of cuts_.    the actual quantities investigated here are _ macroscopic loop amplitudes _",

    "since the worldsheet cft calculation of fractional super liouville field theory @xcite is far from completion , the study of macroscopic loop amplitudes is important not only for an understanding of the actual dynamics of this system , but also it could provide an important clue to the analysis of this not - yet solved liouville theory .    in this paper , the macroscopic loop amplitudes are studied within the daul - kazakov - kostov prescription @xcite and its multi - cut extension @xcite . in the dkk prescription ( reviewed in the begining of section [ sectioncoshsinh ] ) , the macroscopic loop amplitude @xmath19 is identified with the eigenvalues of the lax operator @xmath20 .",
    "it turns out that there are generally two kinds of solutions in the fractional - superstring critical points : one solution is given by hyperbolic cosine and the other is by hyperbolic sine functions : @xmath21 in the background with the bulk cosmological constant @xmath22 .",
    "the integer @xmath23 is the label of eigenvalues of the lax operator @xmath20 .",

    "( [ cssolintroduction ] ) is given by some proper rational number , and only this part of the amplitudes depends on the models we consider : the number of cuts , @xmath1 , and the hermiticity of the two - matrix models , i.e. the leading gamma matrices ( [ gammaintroduction ] ) : @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",

    "in addition to these quantitative results , we also discuss several implications based on our analysis as follows :    from the first sight , it might seem strange that the single macroscopic loop amplitude @xmath19 or resolvent operator corresponds to the @xmath1 different amplitudes @xmath31 ( @xmath23 ) which are realized as eigenvalues of the lax operator @xmath20 .",
    "however we argue in section [ multicutgeometrystokessection ] that they play an important role to make up the _ @xmath1-cut geometry _ anticipated from the definition of the @xmath1-cut two - matrix models .",
    "the idea is based on the study about _ stokes phenomena _ in the baker - akhiezer functions @xcite .",
    "that is , although each amplitude @xmath31 has maximally _ two cuts _ on their branch , the resolvent operator @xmath19 can have @xmath1 semi - infinite cuts by being patched with @xmath1 different amplitudes @xmath31 in _ different stokes sectors _ of the multi - cut baker - akhiezer function .",
    "the patching rule is also proposed in section [ multicutgeometrystokessection ] .",
    "the reduction of the number of cuts on each branch is also related to the highly reducibility of our resulting algebraic curve of the macroscopic loop amplitude .",
