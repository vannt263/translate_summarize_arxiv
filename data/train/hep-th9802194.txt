    "it has long been supposed that a type iia string suitably compactified on a  threefold is dual to a heterotic string suitably compactified on a product of a k3 surface and a 2-torus @xcite .",
    "the resulting physics in four dimensions consists of a theory with @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "at least locally , the moduli space for these theories is a product of a special khler manifold corresponding to moduli in the vector supermultiplets , and a quaternionic khler manifold corresponding to moduli in the hypermultiplets .",
    "the vector moduli space has been fairly well understood for some time now ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hypermultiplet space has been somewhat more awkward to understand ( although some progress has been made , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "an almost equivalent problem arises in f - theory .",
    "if one compactifies f - theory on a  threefold it can be dual to the heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface .",
    "our resulting theory is now an n=1 theory in six dimensions .",
    "there is still a quaternionic khler moduli space corresponding to the moduli in the hypermultiplets . indeed ,",
    "if this six - dimensional theory is compactified on a 2-torus , we recover the @xmath3 theory in four dimensions above with an unchanged hypermultiplet moduli space .",
    "let us consider the type iia string compactified on a particular threefold , @xmath4 .",
    "the hypermultiplet moduli space is then composed of deformations of the complex structure of @xmath4 , together with ramond - ramond moduli living in the `` intermediate jacobian '' of @xmath4 , and the dilaton and axion . on the other hand , in the heterotic string picture",
    "the hypermultiplet moduli space consists of deformations of a particular bundle on the k3 surface together with deformations of the underlying k3 surface itself .",
    "the central question in understanding the moduli space of hypermultiplets is to know exactly how to match this data between the type iia and heterotic picture .",
    "thus somehow given a  threefold together with its intermediate jacobian , we should be able to `` derive '' some k3 surface with a particular bundle .",
    "this is not a property of known classical geometry .",
    "a very similar statement could be made concerning mirror symmetry . in this case",
    "a type iia string compactified on a threefold @xmath4 is dual to a type iib string compactified on the mirror  threefold @xmath5 .",
    "again one did not know classically how to `` derive '' @xmath5 given @xmath4 .",
    "the key idea in mirror symmetry was to think in terms of large radius limits and `` large complex structure '' limits .",
    "similarly this paper will dwell on the analogous boundary in the hypermultiplet moduli space .",
    "this latter question is much more interesting than that of mirror symmetry . indeed",
    "this whole subject of exploring the moduli space of hypermultiplets looks like a much richer version of the story of mirror symmetry .    the main purpose of the paper is to identify an integer structure on the type iia side , coming from @xmath6 , with an integer structure on the heterotic side coming from @xmath7 and the bundle data .",
    "this is a very useful handle for picturing how the moduli space of hypermultiplets is mapped between the type iia string and the heterotic string .    in section [ s : sd ]",
    "we will discuss the boundary of the moduli space we need to study to remove all quantum effects .",
    "this includes a discussion of the @xmath8-field on the heterotic k3 surface . in section [ s : bun ]",
    "we will discuss the moduli space of bundles on a k3 surface in the language of string duality .",
    "much of this section follows from the work of friedman , morgan and witten @xcite but we explain the construction in detail for a few examples .",
    "finally in section [ s : disc ] we discuss the integral structure and some of its consequences .",
    "the type iia string compactified on a  threefold , @xmath4 , has the following moduli :    1 .",
    "the dilaton , which governs the string coupling , and the axion coming from dualizing a two - form in four dimensions .",
    "together these form a complex field , @xmath9 .",
    "we assert that @xmath10 is the weakly - coupled limit of this type iia string theory .",
    "2 .   a metric which is determined by the complex structure of @xmath4 and the cohomology class of its khler form . when all length scales in @xmath4 are large with respect to the string tension , this metric is ricci - flat .",
    "3 .   a @xmath8-field which takes values in @xmath11 ( at least when @xmath4 is large ) .",
    "ramond - ramond fields , @xmath12 .",
    "for some integer @xmath13 .",
    "this may cause the rr moduli to live in @xmath14 . if this is the case then some of the statements in this paper need to be modified to take this isogeny into account . ]",
    "the khler form modulus and the @xmath8-field pair up to form the `` complexified khler form '' . the moduli space of vector moduli , @xmath15 , is parametrized by this complexified khler form .",
    "there are world - sheet instanton corrections to this moduli space however and the complexified khler form is only a valid coordinate near the large radius limit of @xmath4",
    ". we will also refer to these world - sheet instantons as @xmath16 corrections as their scale is determined by the string tension .",
    "@xmath15 is a special khler manifold ( at least where it is smooth away from any boundary points ) .",
    "the other fields , namely @xmath9 , @xmath17 , and the complex structure of @xmath4 parameterize the hypermultiplet moduli space .",
    "again this moduli space is subject to corrections except that this time the corrections are due to string coupling .",
    "the above parameters are only good coordinates when we are near the limit of a weakly - coupled string , @xmath10 .",
    "the moduli space built from these parameters is a quaternionic khler manifold and we denote it @xmath18 .",
    "now let us consider the heterotic string .",
    "there are two types of heterotic strings which we label by @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath19 is either equal to @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where the latter case is usually referred to as the @xmath0 heterotic string .",
    "arises as the possibility of exchanging the two @xmath22 s .",
    "it is essential to include this possibility in order to understand duality between the two heterotic strings correctly @xcite . ]",
    "the heterotic string compactified on a product of a k3 surface , @xmath23 , and a 2-torus , @xmath24 , has the following moduli :    1 .",
    "the dilaton , which governs the string coupling , and the axion coming from dualizing a two - form in four dimensions .",
    "together these form a complex field , @xmath25 .",
    "we assert that @xmath26 is the weakly - coupled limit of this heterotic string theory .",
    "2 .   a ricci - flat metric on @xmath27 .",
    "3 .   a @xmath8-field which takes values in @xmath28 ( at least when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are large ) .",
    "4 .   a @xmath19-bundle on @xmath27 with a connection satisfying the yang - mills equation .    in order to proceed",
    "further we need to make a restriction on the type of this bundle .",
    "let @xmath29 and assume that the @xmath19-bundle on @xmath27 may be viewed as a product of a @xmath30-bundle on @xmath23 and a @xmath31-bundle on @xmath24 .",
    "the vector multiplet moduli space , @xmath15 , can now be viewed as being parametrized by @xmath25 , the moduli of the @xmath31-bundle on @xmath24 and by the deformations of the metric and @xmath8-field on @xmath24 .",
    "this moduli space is subject to corrections from the string coupling and identifications from t - dualities for @xmath24 .",
    "the above parameters are only seen as good coordinates when @xmath26 and the area of @xmath24 is large .",
    "the hypermultiplet moduli space , @xmath18 , can be viewed as being parametrized by the moduli of the @xmath30-bundle on @xmath23 and by the deformations of the metric and @xmath8-field on @xmath23 .",
    "the corrections to this moduli space are , as yet , not fully understood but we will see that this picture is probably prone to @xmath16 corrections . what is clear is that the above parameters are good coordinates when the volume of @xmath23 is large .",
    "the main purpose of this paper will be to try to match the type iia ( or f - theory ) picture of the moduli space @xmath18 with that of the heterotic string .",
    "going to the limits in which we remove the quantum corrections , we may match our coordinate systems and obtain a map between a  threefold , @xmath4 and a bundle on a k3 surface , @xmath23 . in order to do this",
    "we need to take @xmath10 and @xmath23 to have a large volume .    the first thing we should worry about are geometrical restrictions on @xmath4 for the above duality to be possible .",
    "we want to impose the conditions that    1 .",
    "we do have a heterotic string dual to the type iia string on @xmath4 which can be recognized as such in a simple way .",
    "2 .   the @xmath19-bundle does indeed factorize nicely as a @xmath30-bundle and a @xmath31-bundle as desired .",
    "it can be shown ( see , for example , @xcite ) that these conditions amount to asking that @xmath4 has a dual fibration  firstly a k3-fibration @xmath32 and as an elliptic fibration @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath8 is @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a ruled rational surface and @xmath36 has at least one section .",
    "now we concern ourselves with the question of how to go to the right boundary in the moduli space to remove the quantum corrections .",
    "first let us deal with @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a 2-torus in @xmath23 which is a smoothly embedded elliptic curve for a suitable choice of complex structure on @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a 2-form which is dual to the 2-cycle which is poincar dual to @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is a ( 1,1)-form for suitable complex structure on @xmath23 .",
    "we may now expand the khler form on @xmath23 in terms of a basis of 2-forms on @xmath23 one of which is @xmath38 .",
    "that is @xmath39 we claim that the limit @xmath10 is equivalent to taking @xmath40 .",
    "this is much simpler to state in the case that @xmath23 is an elliptic fibration with a section , @xmath41 .",
    "now taking @xmath10 is equivalent to taking the area of the section ( or base ) to be very large .",
    "this may be proven by using a fibre - wise duality argument much along the lines of @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that taking the heterotic string to be weakly - coupled is the same as taking the section of @xmath4 as a k3-fibration to be very large .",
    "here we are arguing the converse  the weakly - coupled type iia string is dual to the heterotic string on an elliptically - fibred k3 surface with a big section .",
    "the fibre - wise duality argument of @xcite works equally well in this case .",
    "to proceed further we will assume that the heterotic k3 surface , @xmath23 , is an elliptic fibration with a section .",
    "note that this will reduce the number of moduli we are allowed to probe  not all k3 surfaces are elliptic with a section .",
    "fortunately we will still be able to reach a boundary where all quantum corrections disappear .",
    "we have argued above that this section of @xmath23 is very large .",
    "if we assume that this k3 is generic ( i.e. , all fibres are of kodaira type @xmath42 ) then we may take the volume of @xmath23 to be very large by making sure that the elliptic fibres have large area .",
    "again we may let fibre - wise duality suggest an interpretation of such a limit in the type iia picture .",
    "we follow an idea first explained in @xcite following the work of @xcite .",
    "consider a dual pair of a heterotic string compactified on @xmath43 and a type iia string compactified on a k3 surface .",
    "the map between the moduli describing these two compactifications is completely known @xcite .",
    "we may thus ask what happens on the type iia side if we take a 2-torus within the 4-torus on the heterotic side to have very large area .",
    "the result is that the k3 surface undergoes a `` stable degeneration '' . precisely what the stable degeneration is depends upon whether we wish to describe the @xmath0 heterotic string or the @xmath20 heterotic string on a large @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath20 case was described in @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath0 case which was described in @xcite .",
    "the result is that the k3 surface becomes a union of two rational elliptic surfaces intersecting along an elliptic curve .",
    "we will describe the geometry of the rational elliptic surface in more detail later . in terms of an elliptic fibration",
    "this union may be viewed as an elliptic fibration over two @xmath34 s touching at a point .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed description of this .",
    "now let us return to the case of a  threefold , @xmath4 , which is a k3-fibration .",
    "the type iia string on this space is dual to the @xmath0 heterotic string on @xmath27 . in order to take the elliptic fibre of @xmath23 to large area",
    "the above argument suggests that we should let each k3-fibre of @xmath4 undergo the corresponding stable degeneration .",
    "that is , @xmath4 becomes a fibration over @xmath8 where each fibre is now the union of two rational elliptic surfaces joining along an elliptic curve . we also want to view @xmath4 as an elliptic fibration over a surface , @xmath35 . in figure [",
    "fig : deg ] we depict our stable degeneration in terms of this elliptic fibration .",
    "we need to introduce quite a lot of notation to describe various aspects of this degeneration .    before the degeneration @xmath35 is a ruled surface . to be specific",
    ", @xmath35 is a @xmath34-bundle over @xmath34 .",
    "we depict these @xmath34-fibres by vertical dotted lines in figure [ fig : deg ] .",
    "we label a generic vertical line by @xmath45 . in the simplest case",
    "we may assume that @xmath35 is the hirzebruch surface @xmath46 along the lines of @xcite .",
    "viewing @xmath46 as a @xmath34-fibration , we can always find a section of self - intersection @xmath47 .",
    "we will denote a generic such section by @xmath48 and we also denote it by a dotted line in figure [ fig : deg ] . note that if @xmath49 then this section is unique .",
    "the elliptic fibration @xmath33 is not smooth . over a discriminant locus , @xmath50",
    ", the fibres degenerate .",
    "we depict this locus by a solid line in figure [ fig : deg ] .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the degenerated version of @xmath4 .",
    "when we go to the stable degeneration , every @xmath45-line will break into two lines intersecting at a point .",
    "thus , the base of our elliptic fibration becomes a bundle over @xmath8 with generic fibre given by _ two _ lines .",
    "restricting the elliptic fibration to either of these two lines will give us a rational elliptic surface .",
    "thus @xmath51 is a fibration over @xmath8 with fibre given by two rational elliptic surfaces intersecting along an elliptic curve .",
    "equally , @xmath51 is the union of two spaces , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , intersecting along a surface which is an elliptic fibration .",
    "we denote this surface @xmath54 ( and thus @xmath55 ) .",
    "meanwhile @xmath35 has become the union of two ruled surfaces , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , intersecting along a @xmath34 .",
    "we denote this @xmath34 by @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath54 is then the restriction of the elliptic fibration , @xmath59 , to @xmath58 .",
    "one may show @xcite that if @xmath35 was given by @xmath46 then each of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are isomorphic to @xmath46 and @xmath58 is a section of both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "with respect to @xmath56 we may chose @xmath48 to be disjoint from the section @xmath58 . in this case @xmath58",
    "becomes a section in the class of @xmath48 within @xmath57 .",
    "the discriminant locus will divide itself between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that if the discriminant within @xmath56 intersects @xmath58 then the elliptic fibration of @xmath54 will contain a bad fibre .",
    "for consistency the discriminant within @xmath57 must intersect @xmath58 at the same point , and with the same degree .      now that we know the way that @xmath4 degenerates at the boundary of the moduli space we wish to consider how we can address the question as to how well the type iia string ( or f - theory ) picture and the @xmath0 heterotic picture agree .    to do this",
    "we will focus on the ramond - ramond fields in the type iia string which live in @xmath60 .",
    "assuming @xmath61 this reduces to @xmath62 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath63 is torsion free .",
    "contains torsion , the ramond - ramond moduli may include discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "this can lead to interesting problems in duality which are not fully understood at this time .",
    "these were discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "this means that the ramond - ramond fields live in the `` intermediate jacobian '' of @xmath4 given by @xmath64 .",
    "we would therefore like to see how @xmath6 behaves as we perform the degeneration @xmath65 .",
    "formally one may analyze this degeneration in terms of the clemens - schmid exact sequence @xcite . roughly speaking the following happens .",
    "consider first a 3-cycle @xmath66 which does not intersect @xmath54 .",
    "clearly this should contribute to @xmath67 .",
    "when counting these contributions the only worry might be that a 3-cycle in @xmath52 may be homologically the same as a 3-cycle in @xmath53 .",
    "actually this can not happen since such an equivalence would imply the existence of an element of @xmath68 , but @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath70 .",
    "the other contribution to @xmath67 arises in a more interesting way .",
    "suppose we have a 2-cycle @xmath37 in @xmath71 .",
    "there are natural maps @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath37 lies in the kernel of both of these maps .",
    "this means that @xmath54 is the boundary of a 3-chain that lives in @xmath52 and another 3-chain that lives in @xmath53 .",
    "thus we may build an element of @xmath67 as shown in figure [ fig : h3 ] .",
    "let us assume that @xmath54 is in the form of an generic elliptic fibration with a section .",
    "the elements of @xmath74 generated by the section and the generic fibre will not be in the kernel of @xmath75 and @xmath76 as they map to the section and fibre of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the other 20 two - cycles of @xmath54 will be in the kernel .",
    "let us denote this ( self - dual ) lattice of cycles by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the root lattice of @xmath22 , taken with a negative signature , and @xmath79 is the hyperbolic plane .",
    "@xmath80 can be thought of as the lattice of cycles in @xmath54 which are not algebraic .",
    "it is known as the `` transcendental lattice '' .",
    "( note that if @xmath54 is not generic then we may expect fewer than 20 cycles to contribute to the kernel and the transcendental lattice will fall in rank . )",
    "we have now argued that @xmath81    on the type iia side therefore , our torus of ramond - ramond moduli has factorized itself nicely into a product of three tori .",
    "what do these three tori correspond to in the heterotic picture ?",
    "firstly we have the heterotic k3 surface itself , @xmath23 .",
    "we know the complex structure of @xmath23 is given by the complex structure of @xmath54 . since we have taken the volume of @xmath23 to be infinite it would be unreasonable to assume we have anything left of the khler form data of @xmath23 .",
    "what remains then is the @xmath8-field .",
    "the obvious thing to do is to associate @xmath80 with part of the moduli space of @xmath8-fields .",
    "this is natural since @xmath80 was derived from @xmath82 .",
    "note that we only see the @xmath8-fields associated to the 20 transcendental cycles  we have `` lost '' two of the degrees of freedom in the @xmath8-field associated to the section and fibre of @xmath23 .",
    "next we have the two @xmath22-bundles . as we shall see in the next section , and has been noted in @xcite , the remaining moduli of @xmath52 taken together with the torus @xmath83 produces the hyperkhler moduli space of one @xmath22 bundle while the corresponding data on @xmath53 produces the other .",
    "we have therefore achieved our goal . by going to this boundary in the moduli space of theories",
    "we have been able to identify the moduli space of theories exactly with the type iia interpretation and exactly with the heterotic interpretation .",
    "this has been at a price of course . on the type iia side",
    "we have lost some of the deformations of @xmath4 and some of @xmath84  resulting in a loss of ramond - ramond moduli . on the heterotic string side",
    "we have lost the khler moduli of @xmath23 and we have lost some deformations of complex structure by demanding that @xmath23 be elliptic with a section .",
    "we also have only 20 of the original 22 @xmath8-field degrees of freedom .",
    "the boundary we have reached has real codimension 24 .",
    "in this section we will discuss the @xmath22-bundle moduli of the heterotic string in the type iia language .",
    "the ideas we present in this section are essentially contained in friedman , morgan , and witten s work @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "we present here some explicit construction methods and we discuss some examples to show how easily the duality map can be seen .",
    "we also need to introduce an important lattice , @xmath85 , for section [ s : disc ] .",
    "our method will focus on the relationship between the associated spectral curve of the bundle and the  group of rational elliptic surfaces .",
    "@xmath52 is an elliptic fibration over @xmath86 .",
    "deformations of this threefold , together with its intermediate jacobian , will give the moduli space of one of the @xmath22-bundles .",
    "again we denote by @xmath48 a section of @xmath46 with self - intersection @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath58 is another section , disjoint from @xmath48 , with self - intersection @xmath87 .",
    "we denote a generic @xmath34-fibre of @xmath46 by @xmath45 .",
    "we thus have the intersection relations @xmath88.[c_0]=-n$ ] , @xmath88.[f]=1 $ ] , and @xmath89.[f]=0 $ ] .",
    "now write @xmath52 in weierstrass form @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are sections of line bundles over @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath93 and @xmath8 denote the divisor classes corresponding to these bundles .",
    "the discriminant is given by @xmath94 .",
    "let us denote the class of the discriminant by @xmath95",
    ". sometimes we will be sloppy with our notation and refer to the discriminant locus itself by @xmath95 .",
    "one may show that @xcite @xmath96 & = [ c_0 ] + n[f]\\\\ a & = 4[c_0 ] + 8[f]\\\\ b & = 6[c_0 ] + 12[f]\\\\ \\delta & = 12[c_0 ] + 24[f ] .",
    "\\end{split }   \\label{eq : classes}\\ ] ]    in the generic case , @xmath95 collides with @xmath45 transversely at 12 points .",
    "this means that , as expected , we obtain an rational elliptic surface by restricting the elliptic fibration to @xmath45 . in kodaira language",
    "this corresponds to building a rational elliptic surface by an elliptic fibration with twelve @xmath42 fibres .",
    "there are many ways of building a rational elliptic surface in weierstrass form .",
    "indeed , persson has listed all 289 ways explicitly @xcite .",
    "of central importance to us will be the notion of the  group of this surface  i.e. , the group of sections taking our given section as the identity .",
    "the  group of all the possible rational elliptic surfaces was also determined in @xcite .",
    "one may show that the homology of 2-cycles of the rational elliptic surface naturally decomposes into three parts :    1 .",
    "the identity section and the fibre .",
    "components of fibres not touching the identity section .",
    "elements generated from the  group .",
    "the picard lattice of the rational elliptic surface is isomorphic to @xmath97 of which the first part accounts for @xmath79 .",
    "this , the components of fibres not touching the 0-section and the  group must account for @xmath78 .",
    "components of fibres missing the 0-section arise when we have bad fibres in the kodaira classification other than @xmath42 and ii .",
    "these are the two - cycles which are shrunk down to zero size to generate enhanced gauge symmetries in the f - theory limit as in @xcite . alternatively in type iia language ,",
    "these are the two - cycles which are shrunk down to zero size in order to switch off the wilson lines around the heterotic 2-torus , @xmath24 , again generating an enhanced gauge symmetry .",
    "since these 2-cycles which miss the 0-section are associated to ( perturbative ) enhanced gauge symmetry , their existence must correspond to the actual structure group of our supposed @xmath22-bundle actually being less than we thought . to be precise ,",
    "let the actual structure group of the bundle be @xmath98 .",
    "then the observed gauge symmetry is given by the centralizer of @xmath99 .",
    "note that the  contribution towards @xmath100 is the complement of this enhanced gauge symmetry contribution within @xmath78 .",
    "this tells us that the  group part of the contribution must be closely associated to @xmath98 .",
    "indeed we shall now see how the group of each rational elliptic surface is key in constructing the heterotic bundles .",
    "in the generic case we have twelve @xmath42 fibres and no enhanced gauge symmetry . in this case",
    "the  group is rank 8 and the structure group really is @xmath101 . as this is the hardest to visualize",
    "let us try something a little more manageable .    at the other extreme of the bundle with a structure group given by the complete @xmath22",
    ", we may try to build a bundle with a trivial structure group .",
    "this may be done and corresponds to `` point - like instantons '' .",
    "this case is somewhat subtle and we postpone it for a while .",
    "instead we try to build an su(2)-bundle .",
    "since @xmath102 is a maximal subalgebra of @xmath103 , the centralizer of su(2)@xmath104 is @xmath105.su(2 ) is _ not _ a subgroup of @xmath22 however ! ]",
    "thus if the heterotic string is compactified on an su(2)-bundle , there will be an unbroken @xmath105 gauge symmetry .",

    "the prym we desire may be written as @xmath179 where the @xmath172 subscript means that @xmath180 for all @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 . in general this",

    ", we must identify these abelian varieties and thus the description of the lattice @xmath150 in the heterotic picture and the type iia picture .",
    "this leads to the key claim that @xmath236 this equation is essential to the notion of duality between the heterotic string on a k3 surface and the type iia string ( or f - theory ) on a  threefold .    as well as automatically identifying the abelian fibres of the moduli space , ( [ eq : yes ] )",
    "also indicates how to naturally identify the bases , @xmath232 , as follows . and",
    "the type iia picture of @xmath232 can be identified locally .",
    "it is possible that type iia @xmath232 may map many - to - one to the heterotic @xmath232 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect this to happen when the prym has more than one component . ]",
    "recall that in the type iia string @xmath232 represents the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath4 and in the heterotic string @xmath232 represents the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath23 and the moduli of the spectral curve for the bundle .",
    "this map shows how the variation of hodge structure on @xmath4 , in terms of periods of the holomorphic 3-form on elements of @xmath237 , may be reduced into a statement about the variation of hodge structure on @xmath23 , in terms of periods of the holomorphic 2-form on this k3 surface on elements of the transcendental lattice , @xmath80 .",
    "the bundle data becomes encoded in a variation of hodge structure of a one dimensional object  the spectral curve . in the case of @xmath188 , @xmath85 is simply @xmath238 and we recover the full moduli space of @xmath116 . in general we only have a sub - variation of hodge structure for the spectral curve .",
    "thus the duality between the heterotic string and the type iia string appears to be encapsulated by relating the 3-dimensional structure of the type iia compactification to a 2-dimensional and a 1-dimensional structure for the heterotic string .",
    "that is , the  threefold is related to a k3 surface and a bundle .",
    "it is interesting to compare this situation to mirror symmetry .",
    "one of the simplest ways of describing the mirror symmetry principal for a  threefold is the exchange of the even ( or vertical ) integral cohomology with the odd ( or horizontal ) integral cohomology .",
    "this picture was first suggested in the work of @xcite and then spelt out more clearly in section 5 of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the way that these integral cohomologies can be identified requires one to go to the `` large complex structure '' of one of the  threefolds .",
    "this was explained in @xcite . only at this boundary _",
    "point _ in the moduli space did one expect the two mirror theories to be exactly equivalent .",
    "away from this boundary point the mirror equivalence becomes complicated by world - sheet instanton effects which come from rational curves .",
    "heterotic / type iia duality has a much richer structure than mirror symmetry .",
    "firstly our boundary where the two theories agree exactly is no longer a point but has a fairly large dimension .",
    "secondly one can see that _ both _ the heterotic string and the type iia string are prone to instanton effects .",
    "each of these can be probed individually by moving away from the boundary in a certain direction .",
    "for example , in order to probe the heterotic string world - sheet instanton effects .",
    "] we need to move away from the boundary without changing the dilaton in the type iia string . in effect",
    "we need to keep the section of @xmath23 infinitely large but we may let the elliptic fibres become finite in size . clearly this moves us away from the stable degeneration discussed in section [ s : sd ] .",
    "it is also evident that the exact correspondence between our moduli spaces will break down .",
    "indeed we may go around a closed loop in the moduli space of @xmath4 producing a highly non - trivial monodromy on @xmath237 .",
    "if there were no quantum corrections to this moduli space then such a monodromy would have to correspond to some sort of t - duality on the moduli space of heterotic strings .",
    "this would imply that the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath4 would be globally _ exactly _ in the form of some teichmller space divided out by this t - duality group .",
    "this is not true for a generic  threefold .",
    "thus the periods in our heterotic string on a k3 surface must generically become `` mixed '' between the variation of hodge structure of @xmath23 and the variation of hodge structure of the spectral curve .",
    "that is , the notion of a k3 surface and the notion of a bundle will become somewhat confused .",
    "this is analogous to the way that the notion of a 0-cycle and a 2-cycle can be confused by mirror symmetry away from the large radius limit .",
    "this confusion in the heterotic string is presumably accounted for by some world - sheet instanton effect just as rational curves appeared in mirror symmetry",
    ". it would be very interesting to study this further .",
    "another amusing fact in this picture is that we know that world - sheet instanton effects must vanish for the heterotic string on a k3 surface if `` the spin connection if embedded in the gauge group '' . in other words , when our bundle becomes the tangent bundle .",
    "if this can be understood in the language of this paper then it should be quite a potent weapon in understanding the global structure of the moduli space further .",
    "it implies that there is a whole @xmath239 exact subspace of the moduli space coming from deformations of the k3 surface .",
    "this probes deeply into regions of the moduli space where the type iia string becomes strongly coupled .",
    "thus we may calculate instanton effects on the type iia side too .",
    "we should emphasize that there is a big difference between mirror symmetry and the map ( [ eq : yes ] ) .",
    "the map given in ( [ eq : yes ] ) does not include the whole of @xmath6 and it does not contain the whole of @xmath240 .",
    "in fact given the nature of the moduli space of strings on k3 surfaces @xcite one might hope that such a map should include the total cohomology @xmath241 .",
    "it would be very satisfying , as well as useful , if we could enlarge the identification of ( [ eq : yes ] ) to include these larger integral structures .    in conclusion",
    ", the moduli space of hypermultiplets of @xmath3 theories in four dimensions coming from compactifications of the type iia string or the heterotic string contains some beautiful structures .",
    "these structures are similar to those of mirror symmetry but appear to be much more powerful .",
