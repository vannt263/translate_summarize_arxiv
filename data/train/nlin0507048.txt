    "in the last two decades , nonlinear lattice ( spatially discrete ) systems have been a very rapidly growing area of interest for a variety of applications @xcite .",
    "such systems arise in physical contexts encompassing , _",
    "inter alia _ ,",
    "beam dynamics in coupled waveguide arrays in nonlinear optics @xcite , the time evolution of fragmented bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in optical lattices ( ols ) @xcite , coupled cantilever systems in nano - mechanics @xcite , denaturation of the dna double strand in biophysics @xcite and even stellar dynamics in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "one of the main objectives of the research in this field is to achieve an understanding of intrinsically localized states ( discrete solitons ) . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices ,",
    "these are fundamental discrete solitons @xcite and discrete vortices ( i.e. , localized states with an embedded nonzero phase circulation over a closed lattice contour ) @xcite .",
    "most recently , a substantial effort was dedicated to the experimental creation of both these entities in photonic lattices induced in photorefractive crystals ( although these systems are only quasi - discrete ) . in particular , fundamental and dipole solitons , soliton trains and necklaces , and vector solitons have been reported @xcite , as well as vortex solitons @xcite .",
    "parallel developments in the experimental studies of soliton patterns in becs have also been very substantial , leading to the creation of quasi-1d dark @xcite , bright @xcite and gap @xcite solitons .",
    "the generation of 2d bec solitons in ols has been theoretically demonstrated @xcite to be feasible with the currently available experimental technology @xcite .",
    "a paradigm dynamical lattice model that appears in the above - mentioned physical problems is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .",
    "various applications of the dnls equation are well documented @xcite . besides being a generic asymptotic form of a whole class of lattice models ( for small - amplitude nonlinear excitations )",
    ", it finds direct applications ( where it furnishes extremely accurate description of the underlying physics ) in terms of arrayed ( 1d ) or bunched ( 2d ) nonlinear optical waveguides , becs trapped in strong ols , and crystals built of optical or exciton microcavities .",
    "an interesting issue in this framework that has not received sufficient attention concerns the influence of anisotropy on the soliton dynamics in 2d lattices .",
    "some of the settings mentioned above are _ inherently _ anisotropic , e.g. , photorefractive crystals @xcite , while others ( in particular , the fragmented becs trapped in strong ols @xcite ) can be easily rendered anisotropic by slight variations of control parameters , such as intensities of laser beams that create two sublattices which together constitute the 2d optical lattice .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand how the lattice anisotropy affects 2d discrete solitons in the dnls equation .",
    "some findings reported below are surprising , demonstrating that anisotropy effects are not straightforward",
    ". the straightforward expectation might be that weak anisotropy is a small perturbation that possibly alters details of parametric dependences of the observed phenomenology but does not change it  structurally \" ( i.e. , essentially the same dynamical features as in the isotropic lattice occur , but at different positions in the parameter space ) .",
    "we find that for the simplest soliton and vortex structures this is indeed the case , while for more sophisticated ones it is not .",
    "more specifically , we find that for especially symmetric ( so - called  supersymmetric \" ) vortices , with their center set at an intersite position , and the topological charge equal to the size of the vortex square frame ( see below for details ) , the isotropic lattice is a _ degenerate _ one , therefore even very weak anisotropy fundamentally alters the stability and dynamical properties of such structures . on the other hand , despite the delicate organization of the supersymmetric vortices , they constitute a structurally stable , i.e. , physically meaningful , class of objects .",
    "we take the dnls equation in the following form : @xmath2where @xmath3 is the complex , 2d lattice field ( the overdot stands for its time derivative ) , @xmath4 is the lattice coupling constant , and @xmath5 & + u_{n , m-1}-2(1+\\alpha ) u_{n , m } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] is the _ anisotropic _ discrete laplacian , which becomes isotropic with @xmath6 .",

    "( [ stationary ] ) and ( [ stateqn ] ) for the general case , @xmath18 .",

    "we now give a summary of results for vortices with higher values of the topological charge .",

    "this type of the configuration with @xmath177 was identified in ref .",
    "@xcite as possessing a real eigenvalue pair with @xmath185 , in excellent agreement with numerical computations .",
    "however , the presence of the small anisotropy for @xmath153 again strongly affects the vortex for reasons similar to the ones presented above . in this case , the reductions leading to the perturbed dynamics in the anisotropic model are described by the following persistence conditions : @xmath186 i&=&2k+1,k=0,1,2,3 , \\\\[2.0ex ] \\alpha \\sin ( \\theta _ { l}-\\theta _ { l+1})&+&\\sin ( \\theta _ { l}-\\theta _ { l-1 } ) \\\\[0.5ex ] i&=&4k+2,k=0,1 , \\\\[2.0ex ] \\sin ( \\theta _ { l}-\\theta _ { l+1})&+&\\alpha \\sin ( \\theta _ { l}-\\theta_{l-1 } ) \\\\[0.5ex ] i&=&4k+4,k=0,1,\\end{array}\\right .    \\label{deq10}\\ ] ] cf .",

    "@xcite can be used to show that the linear stability eigenvalues for such a vortex soliton will be given , to the leading order , by eq .",

    ", even in the weakly anisotropic case ( e.g. , for @xmath170 ) one finds that the corresponding @xmath189 jacobian possesses three real @xmath190 eigenvalues , which result in an instability ( contrary to the single real @xmath160 eigenvalue in the @xmath6 case ) .",
    "hence , once again , the anisotropy results in a significant destabilization of the super - symmetric vortex , in comparison to the isotropic model . as a specific example",

    "the comparison of the numerical prediction for the eigenvalue dependence on @xmath4 versus the corresponding analytical prediction ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) based on the above results is given in fig .",
    "[ dfig3 ] , demonstrating a very good agreement between the two .",

    "the solid and dashed lines depict the numerical and analytical results.,height=188 ]    to highlight the substantial differences between the dynamics in the isotropic and anisotropic models , we have performed numerical simulations of the super - symmetric vortex with @xmath177 . in this case",

    "@xmath200 considered here , the three unstable eigenvalues for @xmath170 are @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , while in the latter case ( isotropic model ) , the only unstable eigenvalue is a much smaller one , @xmath204 .",
    "naturally , we observe the instability setting in much earlier in the anisotropic model ( at @xmath205 ) than in the isotropic one ( at @xmath206 ) .",
    "but for the supersymmetric vortex of the @xmath177 type .",
    "the four lines ( solid , dashed , dotted , and dash - dotted ) and four symbols ( circles , pluses , stars and triangles ) are used to denote the squared absolute values of the field at the eight sites carrying the vortex in the anisotropic ( top ) model and its isotropic counterpart ( bottom ) for @xmath207.,height=226 ]    one may be wondering whether the strong dynamical effect of the weak anisotropy should be attributed to the super - symmetry of the vortex , or maybe just the specific type of contour which carries the vortex . to check this ,",
    "we have also considered the vortex with @xmath208 sitting on the same @xmath209 contour . given the lack of the super - symmetry in the latter case",
    ", the bifurcation of the relevant @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) eigenvalue pairs occurs at the leading - order reduction and all of them are proportional to @xmath212 .",
    "more specifically , for the largest pair in the isotropic case ( for instance ) , the proportionality factor is @xmath213 . in the anisotropic case with @xmath170 ,",
    "the seven pairs remain on the imaginary axis , being slightly perturbed due to @xmath153 .",
    "for instance , the largest one among them is now @xmath214 . on the other hand , for @xmath215 ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue pair is @xmath216 .",
    "this also is in line with our above results on the fundamental discrete soliton and vortex cross , since it indicates that , for @xmath74 , the collision of this eigenvalue with the continuous spectrum ( which leads to the hamiltonian hopf bifurcation ) will occur at smaller @xmath4 , the opposite being true for @xmath73 .",
    "hence the stability diagram of the @xmath217 vortex square is quite similar to that shown for the fundamental soliton and vortex cross in figs .",
    "[ dfig1 ] and [ dfig2 ] ( therefore , it is not shown here ) .",
    "in this work , we have examined effects of anisotropy on lattice nonlinear dynamical systems supporting discrete solitons and vortices .",
    "the two - dimensional discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation was used as a paradigm model .",
    "the variational approximation was developed for fundamental solitons , showing ( by means of the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion ) that broad quasi - continuum ones are unstable , while strongly anisotropic solitons are stable . by means of numerical methods",
    ", we have found that usual localized states , such as the fundamental discrete solitons and vortex crosses , are only mildly affected by the anisotropy , which results in a modified stability region ( reduced when one direction features a stronger coupling than the isotropic limit , and augmented when the coupling along this direction is weaker ) .",
    "general phenomenology for such states is similar to that for their counterparts on the isotropic lattice .",
    "the main finding reported in the present work is that the assumption about mild deformation of the stability region induced by weak anisotropy is not valid for the delicate super - symmetric vortex states residing on square contours , in the case when the vorticity @xmath0 is equal to the contour s size @xmath1 . in this special case ,",
    "the degeneracy of the leading - order existence conditions ( dictated by lyapunov - schmidt theory ) specific to the isotropic case is broken by the anisotropy .",
    "this , in turn , results in a dramatically different behavior ( as a function of the intersite coupling constant ) of the corresponding linear stability eigenvalues , in terms of both the order of their bifurcation , and the number of real eigenvalues . as a consequence , the supersymmetric vortex - square structure that was marginally stable in the isotropic case is found to be strongly unstable even on the weakly anisotropic lattice .",
    "similarly , the supersymmetric vortex with @xmath177 is found to be much more unstable in the anisotropic case in comparison to its isotropic counterpart .",
    "the most natural systems for experimental observation of the results predicted in this work are deep optical lattices trapping becs , and bundled sets of nonlinear optical waveguides ( the latter have been recently created experimentally @xcite ) .",
    "anisotropic lattices can also be induced in photorefractive media , but this medium should be considered separately , in view of the different ( saturable ) character of the optical nonlinearity in this case .",
    "such investigations are currently in progress and will be reported elsewhere",
    ".    a further natural extension of this work would be to examine effects of anisotropy in three - dimensional lattices on discrete solitons , vortices , dipoles and quadrupoles of various types , octupoles , and more exotic localized configurations , that were recently investigated for the isotropic case in refs .",
