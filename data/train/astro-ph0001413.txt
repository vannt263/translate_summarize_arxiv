    "while `` classical '' radio galaxies powered by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) dominate 1.4ghz source counts above @xmath31mjy , deeper radio surveys reveal a `` new '' population of radio galaxies at sub - millijansky levels .",
    "spectroscopy and multicolour photometry @xcite show that the faint radio population comprises an increasing proportion of star forming galaxies and a decreasing proportion of agn - powered galaxies .",
    "the evolutionary status of the star - forming galaxies , and the role of interactions and mergers in the population are only partially understood .",
    "this paper presents one of the first studies of the sub - mjy population in an abell cluster ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "radio surveys of clusters of galaxies typically detect only a few sources that are true cluster members .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the detection rate of bright radio sources ( s@xmath4mjy ) in abell clusters is about 5% when corrected for chance coincidences .",
    "any such detections are intrinsically luminous , agn - powered radio galaxies . at fainter flux density limits , ( s@xmath5mjy ) , @xcite detected at least one radio source in just under 40% of a distance - limited cluster sample ( @xmath6 ) , with a mean number of 1.4 radio sources per cluster .",
    "similar studies have been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sources detected in these deep surveys are again almost all agn - powered , with radio luminosities greater than @xmath7whz@xmath2 .",
    "late - type galaxies in clusters are sometimes detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but less frequently due to their low radio luminosity and low space density .    the importance of excising cluster radio source contributions in measurements of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect has prompted a few deep surveys of selected clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these studies have not intended to explore the astrophysical properties of the detected sources , and have not done so .",
    "this paper discusses the cluster radio sources found in a deep 1.4ghz survey ( the _ phoenix deep survey _ , pds ) which covers part of dc0107@xmath046 ( abell 2877 , see @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ; appendix  [ app ] summarises the main properties of this cluster ) .",
    "the survey region was chosen to avoid if possible sources brighter then @xmath8mjy , and it contains none of the apparently bright , intrinsically luminous , agn - powered sources described above .",
    "we show , however , that the sub - mjy radio source population in the cluster is dominated by low - power ( l@xmath9whz@xmath2 ) sources which are still generally powered by agns .",
    "we adopt @xmath10kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 and @xmath11 in the following analysis and discussion .",
    "the _ phoenix deep survey _ ( pds , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) covers a high - latitude region of low optical obscuration and devoid of bright radio sources .",

    "optical identifications of the radio sources have been attempted by cross - matching the radio and optical catalogues .",
    "approximately 50% of the radio sources have candidate optical identifications",
    ". optical spectra of over 200 of the optical candidates have been taken using the 2 degree field facility ( 2df ) of the aat .",
    "these have been analysed to yield redshifts and , in many cases , spectroscopic classifications of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the 2 degree pds field overlaps part of a2877 .",
    "while almost all of the pds galaxies lie beyond the cluster , the overlap nevertheless provides an opportunity to explore the sub - mjy population in the cluster itself .",
    "this exploration is assisted by a study of galaxy cluster dynamics by @xcite reporting redshifts for 125 galaxies which were candidates for membership of a2877 . of these 125 objects ,",
    "spectroscopy by @xcite showed that 2 are foreground galaxies and a further 34 have radial velocities outside the @xmath18 clipped sample or lying in a sheet behind the cluster .",
    "this leaves 89 spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies .",
    "radio counterparts of these a2877 members have been sought by cross - matching the optical sources of @xcite with the pds radio catalogue .",
    "the region of the pds overlaps about 75% of a2877 and contains 70 of the 89 cluster galaxies within the radio survey area .",
    "of these 70 galaxies , 15 ( 21% ) are detected at 1.4ghz .",
    "there are 6 other radio detections identified with galaxies excluded from the cluster by @xcite : 2 from the background sheet ( velocities between 9000 and 10000kms@xmath2 ) and 4 at higher redshifts ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "a fourth , unclassified galaxy is likely to be a spiral or peculiar spiral .",
    "the remainder are s0 galaxies apart from the cd , one e / s0 and one unclassified but early - type galaxy .",
    "there is no obvious tendency for radio detections to favour a particular hubble type in this cluster .",
    "our survey is unusually deep for a radio survey of an abell cluster , and it detects a relatively large fraction ( @xmath40 % ) of the optical cluster members .",
    "however , our results are consistent with the known properties of early - type galaxies in the field .",
    "@xcite studied 5ghz emission from nearby optically selected early type ( e / s0 ) galaxies .",
    "they found that 2030% of their sample ( with optical luminosities",
    "similar to those probed here ) show radio emission with luminosities similar to those of the sources in the present sample .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter sjk ) find that the probability distribution of radio luminosity is roughly uniform across the range of luminosities found in our study ( @xmath41  @xmath42whz@xmath2 ) , with some tendency for a smaller fraction at higher luminosities .",
    "this is also consistent with our study , as is demonstrated in figure  [ flf1 ] comparing the fractional bivariate luminosity function ( fblf ) of sjk with that of the present sample .",
    "the fblf estimates the distribution of radio luminosities ( @xmath43 ) for galaxies in a given optical magnitude ( @xmath44 ) range .",
    "the construction of the fblf for the cluster sample used 31 cluster galaxies which fall in the luminosity ranges of figure  [ flf1 ] ( with radio detections or upper limits from the pds and @xmath45 magnitudes from the cosmos database , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . to improve the statistics of this calculation ,",
    "the galaxies with 1.4ghz upper limits were distributed uniformly throughout the bins they could possibly occupy , rather than using a more sophisticated maximum - likelihood method ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this simple approach still gives consistent results , however , with the the method described by @xcite , where there are sufficient cluster detections for its use .",
    "there is good agreement between the samples in the two brighter magnitude bins where the range of radio luminosities overlaps , and the apparent excess for the cluster sample in the fainter bin is still consistent with the data of sjk .",
    "although no morphological distinction was made when compiling the cluster sample for this analysis , differences resulting from the inclusion of late - type cluster galaxies are small given that the cluster is dominated by early - type galaxies .",
    "within the statistical uncertainty of our small sample , our cluster results are consistent with the results of sjk .",
    "the different distribution of hubble - type between cluster and field environments has long been known ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and this does influence the statistics of our cluster sample compared with the field . according to @xcite , for example , the space density of star - forming _ field _ galaxies with @xmath46 ",
    "@xmath47whz@xmath2 is at least an order of magnitude larger than that of early - type ( agn ) galaxies .",
    "however , the galaxy population in a2877 , like other nearby clusters , is dominated by early types .",
    "the absence of a statistically significant difference between our cluster sample and the sjk early - type galaxy sample suggests that at least in a2877 the power of the radio sources are not influenced by the cluster .",
    "the few late - type galaxies positively classified in a2877 and detected in the radio appear to have properties ( such as fir emission ) analogous to comparable field galaxies . for these objects",
    "it has been possible to estimate star formation rates from the 1.4ghz and h@xmath20 luminosities .",
    "the estimates of h@xmath20 luminosity derived from ew measurements predict sfrs higher than the radio , and those from flux calibrated spectra systematically lower .",
    "this may be the result of two effects .",
    "first , the ew measurements yield an h@xmath20 luminosity based on the r - band luminosity for the whole galaxy , which may well overestimate the true value in low sfr galaxies ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "*  their figure  1 ) .",
    "second , the flux calibrated spectra are sampling only a small portion of these galaxies , and not necessarily the region containing current star formation .",
    "the presence of any extinction would serve to lower these luminosities even further .",
    "hence it is unsurprising that the sfrs implied from these luminosities are significantly lower than that deduced from the radio ( and the fir ) .",
    "these results are not inconsistent with the large scatter revealed by @xcite , although the systematic underestimates are uncharacteristic of the trend they observe at low star formation rates .",
    "we have detected 1.4ghz emission from 15 galaxies confirmed as members of the cluster a2877 . for 2 of these",
    ", the radio emission is likely to be due to star formation processes , with star formation rates of 1.3 and @xmath48yr@xmath2 .",
    "one source ( pdf  j010946.5@xmath0454657 ) is probably a seyfert 2 , and in a further 5 galaxies both agn and star formation processes may be contributing to the detected radio emission . of the remaining 7 galaxies , 6 show only absorption features in their spectra , typical of evolved stellar populations , and one has no spectrum available .",
    "our deep survey has allowed us to probe radio luminosities at the distance of the cluster to the same depth as that reached by @xcite in the field , albeit with far fewer numbers in our sample .",
    "the fraction and luminosity distribution of radio sources in the early - type galaxies in a2877 is indistinguishable from the properties of field galaxies of the same type .",
    "we do , however , find two examples in which the presence of companions might play a role in the radio emission . whether this is a special characteristic of the cluster environment , however",
    ", we can not say .    none of the radio - detected galaxies in the cluster show evidence for strong morphological distortion .",
    "interactions between galaxies and detectable dwarf companions do not appear to be necessary to excite radio emission , although in specific cases such interactions may still occur , with pdf  j011047.2@xmath0454701 being one potential example .",
