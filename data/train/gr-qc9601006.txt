    "( [ st])([kx ] ) we see that near criticality , first derivatives of the potential are continuous ( hence also the mass , what implies zero latent heat ) , while second derivatives diverge .",

    "( [ entropia ] ) and ( [ ecest ] ) we obtain @xmath73    we have plotted the equation of state ( [ ecest ] ) in figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) . in the first figure we fist observe that the charge presents a maximum at the same value @xmath74 , its value being independent of the temperature . if we consider a fixed value of the charge , like the one shown in the figure , we see that at low temperatures there are two possible values of @xmath60 , denoted by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "as we rise the temperature of the system , those two states merge together at the critical temperature @xmath77 . above this temperature ,",
    "no equilibrium state is possible .",
    "one can also see that a state in the branch @xmath75 of the equation of state has a higher mass than the corresponding state labeled by @xmath76 since @xmath78 and from eqs .",

    "@xmath82 ranges form @xmath83 for @xmath84 to zero for @xmath85 .",
    "finally , when the charge of the black hole is negative we have the same plot reflected thought the origin to the third quadrant .    in the second figure",
    "we see that at a fixed value of the charge we can have any temperature from zero to @xmath25 by letting @xmath60 vary in the range ( 0,1 ) [ the same happens for @xmath17 fixed ; we have @xmath86 .",
    "] i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "when negative charges are considered we have reflection of this figure to the fourth quadrant .",
    "further insight can be gained on the stability of the branches @xmath75 and @xmath76 when we consider the helmholtz potential ( [ potencial ] ) shown in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , it comes out clearly from the figure that the branch @xmath76 represents a minimum of the potential , while the branch @xmath75 is a maximum . since black holes in @xmath75 have a higher mass than those in @xmath76 they have a lower ratio @xmath88 and they are in the branch closer to the uncharged black holes ( i.e. schwarzschild ones ) .",
    "in fact , this black holes possess a negative heat capacity that indicate they can not be held in equilibrium with an infinite radiation bath .",
    "depending on the sign of the perturbation they can evolve towards the stable minimum by losing mass ( for instance , if they keep a temperature higher than that of the bath ) or towards the schwarzschild  like holes by indefinitely gaining mass in favor of the radiation bath ( for instance , if they keep a lower temperature than the bath ) . on the other hand ,",
    "black holes in branch @xmath76 have a higher ratio @xmath88 that makes their heat capacity positive , allowing them to be in equilibrium with radiation .",
    "as we rise the temperature , the two branches merge together and the stable state @xmath76 disappears for @xmath89 , making the hole evolve towards an infinite mass state .",
    "we can thus compare this phenomenon with what happens in a magnet near criticality : at high temperature the magnet do not present any net magnetization @xmath90 , but as we lower its temperature below it curie point @xmath91 one observes a spontaneous magnetization to appear even at zero external applied field . further lowering its temperature ,",
    "makes to increase the magnetization .",
    "two values of the magnetization @xmath92 are possible depending on the initial perturbation . the analogy with our black hole system here",
    "is limited since one of the two branches of the electrostatic field ( our order parameter ) , the @xmath93 , is unstable .",
    "in this restricted sense , the transition between branch @xmath75 and @xmath76 ends at @xmath94 which can be called a critical point . @xmath25 now being the parameter that gives the change in the stability properties of highly charged  rotating black holes ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "in the above analysis we have supposed that @xmath60 could not be bigger than one since this represents the extremal black hole . if we also consider negative charges this statement generalizes to @xmath96 . but let us be curious enough to see what represents @xmath97 . to do so , we take the last equation in ( [ temperatura ] ) , and plug the explicit form of @xmath6 into @xmath98 to keep @xmath60 real we consider @xmath99",
    ". one can thus probe the following implications :    \\1 ) @xmath100 and    \\2 ) @xmath101    [ the analogous implications hold for the rotating ( kerr ) hole and can be probed by use of the second equation in ( [ temperatura ] ) . ]",
    "we are thus dealing with negative mass objects .",
    "let us also note that the kerr ",
    "newman metric ( [ kn ] ) is invariant under the change of sign of its parameters and the radial coordinate @xmath102    note that while the last two reflections have a natural interpretation , we usually do not consider negative mass objects due to its odd stability properties and the fact that the represent naked singularities [ also , changing the sign of @xmath103 is not a covariant transformation , but for our following discussion of the thermodynamical variables this will not be relevant . ]    if we extend the usual thermodynamic relations by the discrete @xmath104 symmetry we find that ( considering now the quantity @xmath105 ) @xmath106 by direct use of the definitions .",
    "that is all the dependence on the mass we need to compute the thermodynamic variables given by eqs .",
    "( [ entropia ] ) and ( [ temperatura ] ) .    for the `` intensive '' variables",
    "@xmath107 and for the `` extensive '' variables @xmath108 [ where the inequalities for @xmath109 quantities are due to @xmath110 , and they become equalities in the extremal case . ]    we are interested in the case of holes in equilibrium with a radiation bath , i.e. in the canonical ensamble . for that",
    ", we have to fix the temperature @xmath17 , the charge @xmath3 and the angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "we have thus to impose only the first two of the @xmath104 transformations ( eqs .",
    "( [ estrella ] ) ) to be able to deal with positive and negative mass states on the same foot at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as a result",
    ", negative mass thermodynamic states will have the last two quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ inten ] ) and ( [ exten ] ) with the sign opposed to that shown .",
    "thus , keeping the positiveness of the angular momentum and charge , but negative angular velocity and electrostatic potential .    in the following",
    "we will discuss the simpler nonrotating charged case .",
    "figure ( [ fig4 ] ) shows how the equation of state extended to all the four quadrants looks like .",
    "the region @xmath111 in the first quadrant is what we have discussed in the last section .",
    "its extention to negative charges is in the third quadrant .",
    "the negative mass states are characterized by @xmath97 and are to the right or to the left of the abscissa axis according to its positive or negative charge respectively .",
    "we shall characterize this states by the label @xmath112 .",
    "we first observe that at a given temperature according to the value we fix for the charge of the system we can have one two or three possible states . at absolute charges below the critical one we have three states .",
    "in addition to the @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the last section we will also have a negative mass state . for @xmath113 only the state @xmath112 is possible ( while there was not state in the last section analysis ) . and",
    "finally , for the critical value of the charge only two states are allowed .",
    "the equation of state crosses also three times the @xmath60 axis .",
    "the points @xmath114 correspond to the @xmath115 limit but in such a way that the ratio @xmath116 , thus @xmath117 too .",
    "the point in the origin corresponds to the infinite mass limit .",
    "note that the full figure looks like the corresponding one for the mean field approximation to the ising model with a non - zero applied external magnetic field and an infinite critical temperature @xcite .    in figure ( [ fig5 ] )",
    "we plot the helmholtz potential that will help us to discuss the most relevant question of the stability of the negative mass objects . for a fixed positive charge @xmath3 we have three qualitatively different kind of potential depending on the value of the temperature . for temperatures lower than the critical one",
    ", the potential has a minimum in @xmath118 corresponding to the negative mass sector , then a relative maximum at @xmath119 and a relative minimum at @xmath120 .",
    "we thus see that the sector @xmath76 of the black holes are now a metastable state that could evolve ( through a first order transition ) to a negative mass state .",
    "as we rise the temperature to the critical one this transition will be smooth and of second order . above the critical temperature ,",
    "the metastable state disappears and only the negative mass object remains , which happens to be the most stable object of the ensamble . since this object has a positive temperature , it could eventually emit more radiation than received form the bath , thus decreasing its mass , but as the absolute value of @xmath2 increases , this makes the emission temperature to decrease , below the bath temperature , thus stabilizing the object .",
    "conversely , a fluctuation in the temperature of the object that make it decrease , would make it gain positive mass on the bath making its absolute value decrease and thus finally radiating at a temperature higher than that of the bath , reaching in that way the stable point again .",
    "in the first part of the paper we have recomputed and corrected the critical exponents for highly rotating  charged black holes given in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have used them to guess the effective dimension of the system .",
    "this can not be done here since we have computed only the thermodynamic exponents ( eqs .",
    "( [ st])([kx ] ) ) , which are _ independent _ of the dimensionality of the system .",
    "critical exponents related to the two point correlation function _ do _ depend on the dimensionality and can be used to determine it .",
    "it is worth noting that critical phenomena have also been observed in numerical analysis of the collapse of a scalar field to form a black hole @xcite , and that the classical value 1/2 for the exponents have also been found there @xcite .",
    "the exponents we computed are classical . to improve them",
    "one should have a quantum version of the analysis , use the renormalization group and get the corrections to ( [ st])([kx ] ) .",
    "this can be done by considering the effective hamiltonian derived from the helmholtz potential and is under current research .",
    "the quantum analysis could eventually give us a physical interpretation of the negative energy states .",
    "in conclusion , although we treat semiclassical ( neither astrophysical nor planck scale ) black holes , it seems that some new ( perhaps quantum ) phenomena appears below the critical temperature @xmath25 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was introduced the concept of `` spin entropy '' and `` spin temperature '' for kerr black holes in terms of the quantities defined on the internal horizon and it was studied its thermodynamics . in particular , @xmath121 , was interpreted as reflecting the inversion of population like in usual spin systems . in our paper , on the other hand , thermodynamic quantities evaluated on the internal horizon appear as a consequence of extending the usual formulae for black holes to objects with negative mass described by the kerr  newman geometry .",
    "its temperature is @xmath122 , thus defined positive , and they can be in equilibrium with an infinite radiation bath .",
    "there still remain , of course , to know if there is any object in nature that could ( at least effectively ) be described in such way ."
