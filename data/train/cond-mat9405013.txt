    "in a recent physical review letter @xcite , to be called s2 , sutherland and shastry introduced a one - dimensional , continuum , multi - component quantum many - body system with a hyperbolic exchange interaction , governed by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 we have set @xmath1 , the mass to be unity , @xmath2 is the exchange operator which permutes particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and we always have in mind the thermodynamic limit , when the number of particles @xmath5 and the box size @xmath6 both become infinite , while the density @xmath7 remains finite . in s2 , scattering in this system was shown to be non - diffractive , and so the system could be solved exactly ( in the thermodynamic limit , with finite size corrections being exponentially small in @xmath6 ) by the asymptotic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the system is characterized by the number of different types b(f ) of bosons ( fermions ) in the system ; we write this as a @xmath8 system .",
    "thus @xmath9 represents a single component system of identical bosons(fermions ) interacting with an interaction strength @xmath10 .",
    "this system has a classical limit , obtained by taking @xmath11 , and in the ground state , the particles _ freeze _ into a lattice with lattice spacing @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 . expanding the hamiltonian in @xmath14",
    ", we find @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the hamiltonian for the elastic degrees of freedom  phonons and solitons  identical to the single component @xmath17 system @xcite .",
    "the additional term of order @xmath18 gives the hamiltonian for the compositional degrees of freedom @xmath19 , @xmath20}}}. \\label{eq-2}\\ ] ] there is exactly one particle to a site .",
    "thus , to order @xmath18 , the elastic and compositional degrees of freedom separate .",
    "coupling between the two occurs through an expansion of the interaction about the regular lattice , and so is of order @xmath21 , and down by another factor of @xmath14 .",
    "( a similar procedure is used to derive the heisenberg antiferromagnet from the half - filled hubbard model . )    in this letter , we will study the spectrum of this lattice hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian has many realizations  as does the corresponding nearest - neighbor model  such as by spins , a ( supersymmetric ) @xmath22-@xmath23 model , @xmath24 spins , etc .",
    "in fact , this system interpolates between the nearest - neighbor model @xcite ( @xmath25 ) , and the @xmath26 lattice @xcite ( @xmath27 ) treated in s2 .",
    "our solution here will rely heavily on sutherland s treatment @xcite  to be called s1  of the nearest - neighbor system .",
    "two results proven in s1 can easily be shown for the hyperbolic case : ( i ) the ground state of the @xmath8 system is identical to the ground state of the @xmath28 system , so for the ground state , we need never consider more than one type of boson which we usually think of as a vacancy ; ( ii ) the hamiltonian with @xmath29 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath19 , hence `` ferro- '' and `` antiferro- '' cases are both included in the ground state of @xmath19 . the pure ( anti)ferro- case is @xmath30(@xmath31 ) .",
    "partial results concerning the integrability of this model have previously appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "because the system is non - diffractive , the wavefunction must be given asymptotically as @xmath32},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is one of the @xmath35 permutations of the @xmath5 asymptotic momenta @xmath36 , @xmath37 is one of the @xmath35 rearrangements of the particles , and @xmath38 are @xmath39 amplitudes related by two - body scattering . the @xmath4 s",
    "are determined by a set of eigenvalue equations , which say that the phase shift of a particle going around the ring must be unity @xmath40 : @xmath41\\prod\\limits_{m(\\ne j ) } { { -\\exp [ -i\\theta _ 0(k_j- k_m)]}\\,}x_{j , j-1}\\cdots x_{j,1}x_{j , n}\\cdots x_{j , j+1}\\,\\psi = \\psi.\\ ] ] here @xmath42 are two - body scattering operators identical to those for the @xmath43-function gas or the nearest - neighbor lattice model ; the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are given in s1 .",
    "the two - body phase shift @xmath44 is the phase - shift for scattering from a @xmath45 potential , and is given as @xmath46.\\ ] ]    using the eigenvalues of the @xmath47 s from s1 , one obtains coupled equations for the @xmath4 s , the first being @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the phase - shift for a @xmath43-function gas : @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 are the quantum numbers , from @xmath52 .",
    "the remaining equations are identical with those of the nearest - neighbor model ; the @xmath4 s couple directly only to the second equation , which has the form @xmath53 the remaining terms and equations are the same as for the nearest - neighbor model , and their form and number depend upon what types of particles we have .",
    "when we take the limit @xmath11 , we must also rescale the asymptotic momenta @xmath4 , defining a new variable @xmath54 .",
    "likewise the asymptotic momenta @xmath55 for the compositional degrees of freedom must be rescaled , but we use the same symbol , so @xmath56 .",

    "the normalization of @xmath64 is @xmath69 while the classical ground state energy is @xmath70 before discussing the solution to this integral equation , we go on and examine the first order corrections to the equation for the @xmath62 s .",

    "( [ eq-2 ] ) . the classical ground state energy in eq .  ( [ eq-13 ] ) can also be expressed as @xmath87 .    as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq-7 ] ) , the only effect of the @xmath62 s  and thus the @xmath4 s  on the @xmath55 s is through the expression @xmath88 returning to the expressions for the energy and momentum of the lattice hamiltonian eq .",

    "( [ eq-15 ] ) for @xmath89 , we see that they can be written as    [ eq-19 ] @xmath90    with @xmath91 defined by @xmath92 eliminating @xmath55 between @xmath93 and @xmath94 gives the dispersion relation @xmath95 for a single excitation of the lattice hamiltonian .",
    "this can also be expressed by the fourier transform of the hopping matrix element , and so @xmath96 this dispersion curve is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "as will become clearer , the solution to the hyperbolic lattice problem depends crucially on the two classical ground state densities @xmath99 and @xmath100 , obeying eq .",
