    "by the commonly accepted point of view , narrowness of the @xmath6 resonance is interpreted by the ozi rule@xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath6 dissolves into three gluons which would then hadronize into measurable hadrons and these processes are ozi suppressed . in fig.1 ,",
    "the three - gluon process diagrams are shown and they are single - ozi - suppressed ( sozi ) or double - ozi ( dozi ) suppressed .",
    "generally one can ignore the contributions from dozi .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "from above discussions and numerical results , one has the following observations .",
    "\\(1 ) the contribution from the hadronic loops is sizable and has the same order of magnitude as that from the sozi process .",
    "\\(2 ) to get reasonable results which are consistent with data , the interference between the sozi contribution and that from hadronic loops is destructive .",
    "\\(3 ) we derive the parameter @xmath5 and the universal @xmath4 by fitting data of the first two distinct modes of @xmath6 and present in the first two columns of table 1 . in our picture",
    ", there are only two free parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath7 which we predict in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath8 are reasonably consistent with the experimental data .    in this work",
    ", we rely on two key assumptions .",
    "the first is that the value @xmath4 is universal for all channels of @xmath0 due to the flavor - blindness of gluon coupling to quarks .",
    "this treatment is similar to that made @xcite for study process @xmath9 in a hot rhic environment .    in this work ,",
    "we re - parameterize @xmath10 in terms of @xmath5 following the ansatz suggested by the authors of ref .",
    "it seems that one may gain some information about the parameter @xmath5 from the fsi calculations @xcite , however , it is not really the case . even though in both calculations , one deals with the triangle diagrams which are composed of only hadrons , the situations are different . for fsi ,",
    "one calculates the absorptive part where only the exchanged meson is off - shell , whereas for the calculation of the dispersive part , all the three mesons in the triangle are off - shell .",
    "form factors are phenomenologically introduced to compensate the off - shell effects at each vertex , thus the form factors should not be the same for calculating the dispersive and absorptive parts , i.e. even though they have the same expressions , the involved free parameters may be different .",
    "it is noted that in the fsi case , the value of @xmath5 in the form factor is expected to be of order unity @xcite , but in the case of hadronic loop the value of @xmath5 is obviously smaller . in our strategy , we do not priori set its value , but let data determine it .    as our conclusion , it is obvious that the contribution from the hadronic loop to @xmath11 should exist .",
    "the question is how large it is compared to that of the sozi processes .",
    "namely , if only the sozi process is responsible for the decays of @xmath6 , it is hard to explain the data and as the contribution from the hadronic loops being added , one can see that the data are well accommodated within a tolerable range . in our scenario , there are only two parameters in the whole scenario and they are determined by fitting data of two channels . with these two parameters ,",
    "we evaluate the branching ratios of the other channels of @xmath0 and the theoretical predictions are consistent with data .",
    "it indicates that the ansatz is reasonable and the whole picture makes sense .",
    "indeed , there is only one channel , i.e. @xmath12 , for which the theoretical prediction on the branching ratio is about 0.6 of the experimental data . even though there exists such a discrepancy , for a rough estimate",
    "the consistency is not bad at all and we would like to urge our experimental colleagues to redo the measurement to get more accurate results . on the other side , so far the sozi processes have not well calculated in the framework of quantum field theory yet , we also need to complete such a derivation and detect the value which we obtained by fitting data and assuming a universality for all modes .",
    "to be more accurate , however , further theoretical and experimental efforts may be needed .",
    "this mechanism should exist not only for @xmath6 exclusive decays , but also for other members of charmonia .",
    "however , for higher excited states of chamonia , the channels with final states composed of charmed hadrons are open , and the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "this picture also applies to the @xmath13 decays and can be tested by the future experimental data .",
    "this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china(nnsfc ) .",
    "one obtains the decay amplitudes of @xmath14 corresponding to fig .",
