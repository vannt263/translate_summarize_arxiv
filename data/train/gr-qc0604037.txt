    "long baseline interferometric gravitational wave detectors are either already taking sensitive data ( ligo @xcite , geo600 @xcite and tama @xcite ) or will be ready to do so in the near future ( virgo @xcite ) .",
    "the most promising candidates for these detectors are coalescing binaries consisting of compact objects such as neutron stars ( ns ) and/or black holes ( bh ) in close orbit , losing energy and angular momentum through the emission of gravitational radiation .    in the past decade a lot of research has been carried out in modelling the late - time dynamics of compact binaries and the emitted radiation . to this end post - newtonian ( hereafter pn ) approximation has been used in which all the relevant physical quantities are expressed as a perturbative series in the parameter @xmath0 which is a measure of the relative velocity of the two component masses of the binary .",
    "the approximation is now available to a rather high order @xmath1 in pn theory @xcite .",
    "these models are definitely accurate enough to serve as faithful templates for matched filtering the radiation from binary neutron stars ( hereafter , bns ) and binaries consisting of primordial black holes ( hereafter , pbhs ) @xcite .",
    "this is because both bns and binary pbhs merge outside the sensitive band of current ground - based instruments and strong relativistic effects that come into play at the time of merger but not properly modelled by the pn theory are unimportant for their observation . in the case of binary black holes ( bbh ) , however , pn models are not quite accurate since these systems will be ultra - relativistic ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) when their frequencies enter the band where the detectors are most sensitive and some of the bbh systems would even coalesce at frequencies where the detectors have the best sensitivity .",
    "there are now models that go beyond the pn theory to predict the waveform given out by these systems and the different models for the binary dynamics predict significantly different waveforms .",
    "current searches for gravitational waves from inspiralling compact binaries employ template waveforms that are based on the _",
    "adiabatic , non - adiabatic _ and _ phenomenological _ models .",
    "the adiabatic waveforms are obtained by using the pn expansions of the conserved energy @xmath4 and flux @xmath5 and solving the energy balance equation @xmath6 which in turn leads to an evolution equation for the angular velocity @xmath7 and hence the phasing of gravitational waves @xmath8 an implicit assumption made in writing the energy balance equation is that @xmath4 does not change ( appreciably ) over an orbital timescale .",
    "there has been significant amount of activity to understand the poor behaviour @xcite of the pn scheme resulting in new improved models that are based on the use of re - summation methods to accelerate the convergence of the pn expansions . the pad re - summation method @xcite uses rational polynomial approximations of the original taylor expansions to improve the convergence of the pn series .",
    "the non - adiabatic models directly integrate the equations of motion ( as opposed to using the energy balance equation ) and there is no implicit conservation of energy that is used in the orbital dynamics as , for instance , in the effective - one - body ( eob ) approach @xcite .",
    "the eob maps the real two - body conservative dynamics onto an effective one - body problem wherein a test mass moves in an effective background metric .",
    "the pn , pad and eob models produce physical waveforms , as opposed to the phenomenological waveforms @xcite .",
    "the latter waveforms capture the main features of the physical waveforms but use unphysical parameters .",
    "nevertheless the phenomenological waveforms themselves fit very well with both the adiabatic and non - adiabatic models , because the scheme uses greater number of free parameters and the parameters are extended to vary over a wider range than that which is physically allowed .      generally speaking ,",
    "since the signal from a coalescing binary can be modelled reasonably well we can employ matched filtering , which is the optimal strategy to search for signals buried in stationary , gaussian noise .",
    "however , real interferometer noise is neither stationary nor gaussian , and we have to use additional consistency checks , such as the @xmath9-test @xcite , to discriminate true events from broadband transients of instrumental or environmental origin .",
    "the matched filtering performs a phase - coherent correlation of the data with a template which is a copy of the model waveform weighted down by the expected power spectral density of the data .",
    "the gravitational wave signal depends on a set of continuous parameters such as the amplitude , the masses @xmath10 and spins of the stars and a fiducial reference time ( taken to be either `` time - of - arrival '' @xmath11 or `` epoch - of - coalescence '' @xmath12 ) and the corresponding orbital phase @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters describing the inclination of the binary orbit and the location of the source on the sky are degenerate with other parameters , and are therefore , ignored in the search problem , although they can be deduced once the response of three or more non - co - located detectors to a gravitational wave event is known .",
    "the eccentricity may also be ignored , since it is expected to be negligible ( due to orbital circularization ) by the time the gravitational radiation enters the frequency band ( 10 - 1000 hz ) of a ground - based detector . in this paper",
    "we will only concentrate on non - spinning systems for which the dimension of the search is restricted to 4 parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) excluding the additional 8 parameters to be used in a spinning system search ( angular momentum of the system and the spin orientation of each object ) .",
    "since the parameters of an incoming gravitational wave signal will not be known a priori , the data must be searched with a set of templates , called _ a template bank _ , designed to cover the whole parameter space .",
    "the distance between the templates in the parameter space is governed by the trade - off between computational power and loss in detection rate due to the discrete nature of the template bank .",
    "the spacing should be chosen so that the loss in signal - to - noise ratio due to the mis - match of the template with the signal does not deprecate the detectability of these sources .",
    "we employ a geometrical approach @xcite in constructing a template bank , namely we define a metric on the parameter space and use local flatness theorem to place templates at equal distances .",
    "the template bank could be seen naively as a uniform grid in the parameter space .",
    "however , to emphasize that this is not , in general a trivial task , we suggest to consider placing dots on a sphere at equal distances .",
    "placing templates on the parameter space depends upon two crucial things : ( i ) geometrical properties of the signal manifold , whether it is flat or curved , and ( ii ) the coordinates chosen for template placement , which could be curvilinear even when the manifold is flat , or `` almost flat '' .",
    "indeed , we need to choose a `` lorentzian - like '' ( or close to it ) coordinate frame . the second point is similar to the problem of laying a regular grid on the plane using either cartesian or polar coordinates .",
    "the situation is even more complicated because the metric , in general , depends on the waveform model and the pn order one chooses .",
    "the different pn models differ significantly from each other in their prediction of the phasing of the waves , making it necessary to search for binary black holes and neutron stars by using not one but all the different families of waveforms currently available .",
    "luckily enough , as we will show in this paper and an accompanying paper @xcite , it turns out that we can use a single bank for _ all _ the different physical waveforms explored thus far .",
    "this bank is currently used by the geo600 and ligo detectors to search for bns , binary pbhs and bbh @xcite .",
    "the signal from a bns sweeps through the detector bandwidth and the two neutron stars can even merge outside the sensitive bandwidth of the current ground - based detectors and the waveforms corresponding to different physical models agree reasonably well among each other ( with overlaps very close to unity ) . for higher mass systems ,",
    "e.g. bbh , the situation changes , the deviation between the various models getting more significant in the sensitive bandwidth of the detectors .    since for bbh the model waveforms from different families do not agree well with each other",
    ", a template bank that employs one pn family of templates will not be efficient to detect signals from another family .",
    "one solution is to filter the data through a number of banks with templates based on all the different models .",
    "if the reasonable assumption that at least one of the available pn models is close to the true gravitational wave signal bears out then our bank consisting of templates from all the different pn families should be efficient enough in capturing the coalescence events .",
    "unexpectedly , we have found that the bank works well as long as the template and signal are both from the same family meaning a single template bank might suffice to filter the data through different pn families .",
    "another approach to this problem is to use a single template bank of phenomenological waveforms @xcite .",
    "buonanno , chen and vallisneri have designed phenomenological waveforms that are motivated by the structure of the pn signal in the fourier domain which , for high mass systems , has good overlaps with all the known models .",
    "they are able to do this by ( a ) introducing ( in the case of non - spinning binaries ) two more parameters than are necessary in the case of physical waveforms and ( b ) allowing the parameters to vary over a wider , and in some cases unphysical , range than in the case of physical waveforms .",
    "the advantage in using the phenomenological templates is that they have been designed to give a good fit not only to known models but also to waveforms which could be `` in between '' these models .",
    "however , there is also a disadvantage in using these waveforms as they are very poor in estimating the physical parameters of the emitting system .",
    "moreover , using two filters instead of one increases the computational cost and the threshold to be used .",
    "it produces more false alarm due to larger size of the corresponding template bank .",
    "so we might want to filter the data with candidate events through a bank of _ physical _ templates for the sake of parameter estimation .    in a companion paper",
    "we shall define and study the efficiency of a phenomenological template bank to capture different physical models of gravitational wave signals using designed and real sensitivity curves of the various interferometers .",
    "we have verified that such a template bank performs well with the minimal expected ( or higher ) efficiency for signals from bbh systems with total mass in the range @xmath14-@xmath15 for designed sensitivity .",
    "for sensitivity seen during the second science run of the ligo interferometers the bank covers the parameter space with good efficiency in the same range of the total mass and a lower frequency cutoff of 40 to 100 hz .      in the rest of this paper",
    "we will discuss only issues related to the physical template bank where both signals and templates are based on the physical models of the gravitational waveform from an inspiralling binary . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spa ] and [ sec : filtering ] we briefly review , respectively , the fourier - domain representation of the signal and the technique of matched filtering in a geometrical language , with the aim of introducing the notation and language used in section [ sec : template placement ] to construct a template bank . section  [ sec : template placement ] constructs a generic template bank to search for binary inspirals from sources with a wide range of masses and applicable to any interferometer .",
    "the template bank specifically targets equal mass binaries but it is suitable for binaries with a small mass ratio as long as the precessional effects due to the spin of the larger body are unimportant .",
    "section  [ sec : efficiency ] discusses the results of monte - carlo simulations performed with different design sensitivity curves from a variety of interferometers .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the main results of this paper and discusses the application of the template bank introduced in this paper to capture other target models to be presented in a separate publication .",
    "for the purpose of the template bank design it suffices to use a simple model of the signal .",
    "we shall use the fourier representation of the standard pn waveform in the so - called restricted pn approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "one neglects the pn corrections to the amplitude of the signal while the corrections to the phase are fully taken into account to the highest order possible / available .",
    "let us begin with the time - domain representation of the waveform .",
    "the response of an interferometric gravitational wave detector to arbitrarily polarized waves from an inspiralling binary of total mass @xmath16 mass ratio @xmath17 , at a distance @xmath18 is given by @xmath19^{2/3 }   \\cos [ \\varphi(t ) + \\varphi_c ] , \\label{eq : waveform1}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that the detector s motion is unimportant during the time when the signal sweeps across its bandwidth .",

    "( [ eq : waveform1 ] ) using the stationary phase approximation @xcite : @xmath26\\\\ \\psi(f ) & = &   2\\pi f t_c + \\varphi_c + \\sum_k \\lambda_k f^{(k-5)/3}. \\label{eq : spa phase}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath12 are the so - called _ extrinsic , _ or _ kinematic _ , parameters and they are defined by the relative orientation and position of the source and the detector and a fiducial time - of - coalescence of the binary .",
    "intrinsic parameters @xmath27 are the _ chirp parameters _ related to the two masses of the binary . at the 2pn order",
    "there are four non - zero _ chirp parameters _ , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 owing to the fact that there is no 0.5pn term in the pn expansion ) , given by @xmath30 the chirp parameters are all functions of the two mass parameters  the total mass @xmath31 and the symmetric mass ratio @xmath32 . instead of the masses",
    "we can choose any two of the chirp parameters to characterize the signal .",
    "the choice @xmath33 in particular , is convenient since the masses can be computed explicitly in terms of these two parameters : @xmath34 often , it is convenient to use chirptimes @xmath35 and @xmath36 in lieu of chirp parameters @xmath37 given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lower - cutoff frequency at which the generation of the templates starts .",
    "the value assigned to @xmath39 should be chosen carefully : while a low value increases the size of the template bank a high value decreases the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "section  [ subsec : fl ] discusses how to optimally determine the lower frequency cutoff .",
    "finally , the chirptimes can also be inverted in terms of the masses @xcite : @xmath40 the correspondence between the two sets of parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0t3 ]",
    "a matched filter is an optimal linear filter to detect a signal of known shape in stationary , gaussian noise .",
    "it can be introduced in several ways and here we shall follow the geometrical formalism @xcite of signal analysis which is most convenient for the construction of a template bank @xcite .",
    "the geometrical picture is more easily motivated by considering the detector output as a discrete time - series rather than a continuous function . without loss of generality",
    "we shall follow this standard procedure in summarizing the basic results from differential geometric approach to signal analysis but often we shall also write the equivalent formulas obtained in the continuum limit .",
    "although the signal is considered as a discrete series in time , it will be treated as a continuous function of the signal parameters to denote all the parameters of the signal , both intrinsic and extrinsic . in specific applications it might be easier to treat the maximisation of the signal - to - noise ratio over some of the extrinsic parameters as we shall briefly discuss in the beginning of the next section . ] , which we shall denote as @xmath43 the notation and language followed here closely resembles that in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the output @xmath44 of a detector is not recorded continuously ; it is sampled discretely , usually at equal intervals @xmath45 chosen so as to obey the sampling theorem ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "thus , the detector output lasting for a time @xmath46 and sampled at a rate @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is a time - series consisting of @xmath49-samples , @xmath50 the set of all possible detector outputs forms an @xmath49-dimensional vector space .",
    "a gravitational wave signal characterized by a set of @xmath51 parameters @xmath52 @xmath53 sampled in a similar way is also an @xmath49-dimensional vector .",
    "however , the set of all signal vectors _ do nt _ form a vector space , although they _ do _ form a manifold ( a @xmath51-dimensional surface in an @xmath49-dimensional vector space ) , with the parameters serving as a coordinate system .",
    "further structure can be developed on this manifold by defining a metric .",
    "it turns out that the statistic of matched filtering naturally leads to the definition of a scalar product between vectors , which can then be used to induce a metric on the signal manifold .",
    "we shall now turn to a brief discussion of the matched filtering in geometrical language .",
    "let @xmath54 [ @xmath55 denote the output of a stationary detector consisting of instrumental and environmental noise background @xmath56 [ @xmath57 and a possible deterministic signal @xmath58 [ @xmath59 .",
    "we treat @xmath56 as a random time - series drawn from a large ensemble whose statistical properties are those of the detector noise .",

    "a vector @xmath67 is said to be normalized if its norm is equal to unity .",
    "if the vector @xmath67 is to begin with not normalized then we can define a vector with unit norm by @xmath76    it follows from the theory of hypothesis testing that in order to detect a _ known _ signal , but with an _ unknown _ set of parameters @xmath52 in stationary gaussian background noise @xmath77 one must construct the statistic @xmath78 given by @xmath79 and maximize it over the parameters @xmath43 here @xmath67 is the template and @xmath80 is the optimal filter .",
    "however , the terms template and optimal filter are often used interchangeably to mean either of @xmath67 or @xmath81 writing the above equation in terms of @xmath82 we see that the statistic @xmath78 is the cross - correlation of the detector output with the optimal filter @xmath82 and not just with the template @xmath83 although at first this seems strange , upon closer inspection one can see why the optimal filter is not just a copy of the signal we are looking for but the signal divided by the noise psd .",
    "the noise psd weighs the correlation differently at different frequencies , making greater contribution to the region of the spectrum where the sensitivity is larger ( i.e. , @xmath84 is smaller ) and smaller contribution where the sensitivity is weaker ( i.e. , @xmath84 is larger ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath85 is the mean of the statistic @xmath78 divided by the square - root of its variance given by @xmath86 where the last equality follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise psd ] ) and our assumption that the noise is a stationary random process with zero mean .",
    "thus , the effect of filtering a signal @xmath87 with a template @xmath67 is equivalent to projecting the signal @xmath87 in the direction of @xmath88 i.e. @xmath89 this projection is , obviously , the greatest when @xmath90 ( the matched filter theorem ) , giving @xmath91 when the template is not the same as the signal the snr is less than the optimal value .",

    "recall that our templates are based on the solution to a pn expansion of the einstein s equations .",
    "thus , our template might not be sufficiently accurate in describing the fully general relativistic gravitational wave signal emitted by a binary during the final stages of the coalescence of two compact objects .",
    "a lot of effort in the last 15 years has been focused on improving the pn templates by ( a )  working out the expansion to higher orders , and ( b )  employing re - summation techniques that accelerate the convergence of the pn expansion .",
    "current searches for gravitational waves deploy several families of template banks representing the different classes of the signal models . if the signal @xmath87 and the template @xmath67 are from different families then an important notion that will be useful in studying the efficiency of the template bank is the so - called _ fitting factor _ introduced in ref .",

    "the discussion in the previous section illustrated the general method for obtaining the metric on a signal manifold whose dimension is equal to the number of parameters characterising the signal .",
    "it might at first , therefore , seem as though we would need templates in the full multi - dimensional signal parameter space .",

    "the initial fiducial frequency @xmath39 defines the range of values of the chirptimes and is not itself a parameter to search for .",
    "however , it affects the length of the signals ( therefore , the parameter space to be covered ) and the snr extracted .",
    "for example , the newtonian chirptime @xmath176 thus , lower values of @xmath39 give longer templates with the immediate consequence of enhancing both the required storage space for templates and the computational cost to filter the data through the template bank .",
    "furthermore , the number of cycles in a template increases as @xmath177 affecting both the overlap between different templates and the number of templates in the bank .    what is really important , both for signal recovery and the number of templates required in the bank , is the effective number of cycles @xcite which depends not only on the lower frequency cutoff but also on the noise psd of the detector .",
    "the reason for this is the following : while the signal power increases with decreasing lower - cutoff as @xmath178 the noise psd @xmath179 increases much faster below a certain frequency determined by the various noise backgrounds .",

    "our choice of lower frequency cutoff is summarized in table  [ tab : banksize ] .",
    "there is subtlety @xcite in the choice of the lower - frequency cutoff .",
    "the optimal snr is only sensitive to the lower - frequency cutoff but not the parameters of the template and the signal because they are both assumed to be the same .",
    "when filtering the data through a template bank , however , we have no optimal templates but for a set of measure zero signals . consequently",
    ", what is important is not the behaviour of the snr ( which only depends on the moment @xmath188 $ ] ) but that of the metric ( which is sensitive to the difference in the parameter values of neighbouring templates ) .",
    "the metric is highly sensitive to the moment @xmath189,$ ] which converges rather slowly as a function of the lower - cutoff .",
    "we have chosen the easier approach described above in choosing the lower - cutoff , as that is less sensitive to the parameters of the system .",
    "the real justification comes from the fact that our choice of the lower - cutoff does not seem to have severely affected the efficiency of the template bank as we shall see later in this paper .",
    "the templates are chosen in the parameter space such it is guaranteed that for every signal in the region of interest there will be at least one template in the bank with an overlap larger than or equal to the minimal match .",
    "in addition to the templates within the parameter space of the search a layer of templates might also be required just outside the boundary of the parameter space to assure the chosen minimal match for all signals within the parameter space .",
    "this happens because some of the templates that lie outside the boundary have coverage within the parameter space ; without them signals with their parameters near the boundary might not have the desired minimal match @xcite .",
    "the template placement algorithm consists of two steps : the first step deals with placing templates along a chosen curve in the parameter space , specifically along the equal - mass curve , while the second step deals with the placement of templates within and outside the boundary of the parameter space .",
    "the preference of chirptimes ( or chirp parameters ) over masses as coordinates on the signal manifold is dictated by the fact that these variables are almost cartesian .",
    "this is clearly seen when considering the 1pn model for which the metric @xmath190 is a constant , i.e.  independent of the chirptimes , while the same metric expressed in @xmath191 or @xmath192 coordinates is not a constant .",
    "thus , the signal manifold at 1pn order is not only flat , the chirptimes are cartesian - like coordinates .",
    "when we go to higher pn orders , the multi - dimensional signal manifold , in which all chirptimes are considered to be independent of one another , is again a flat manifold but the physical chirp manifold ( i.e.  the manifold formed by signals expected from the inspiral of black hole binaries ) is only a two - dimensional manifold that is obtained by imposing the constraints @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and so on . this physical manifold , could , in principle , be a curved manifold but the curvature is not likely to be large since the absolute value and range of higher order chirptimes is small compared to the most dominant chirptimes .",

    "this suggestion was independently explored and extended by buonanno , chen and vallisneri @xcite ] . as we do not wish to place templates in this forbidden region ( although this is , in principle , perfectly possible )",

    "another issue is the randomization of the mass parameters , for which there are several choices : one choice could be to have a uniform distribution of component masses .",
    "however , this choice will not probe our template bank properly ; indeed , the corresponding distribution of the total mass will be under - populated in the small or the large total mass range .",
    "in fact , in order to properly test a template bank , we should inject signals using uniform distribution of the parameters used to design the bank . namely the set @xmath231 .",

    "we found it more convenient to inject signals with a uniform distribution in the total mass of the binary , although this choice is not necessarily astrophysical .",

    "such a distribution would emphasize any problems with the efficiency of the template bank associated with waveforms that terminate in the sensitive bandwidth of the detector and/or have short duration .      from the results of the monte - carlo simulations we construct several figures of merit ( foms ) that are relevant in validating the template bank .",

    "a drawback of the first fom is that it hides the information about the mass ratio @xmath32 and its relationship to the efficiency .",
    "although not important in the bns case , where the minimum value of @xmath32 is equal to 0.1875 , it can be interesting in other cases to look at the dependency of the efficiency on the @xmath32 parameter .",

    "<S> the bank is efficient to search for various compact binaries such as binary primordial black holes , binary neutron stars , binary black holes , as well as a mixed binary consisting of a non - spinning black hole and a neutron star . </S>"
