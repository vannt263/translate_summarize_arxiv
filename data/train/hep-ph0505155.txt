    "several clean tests have been proposed in these decays , which are sensitive to the chiral structure of the quark couplings in the standard model .",
    "examples of such tests involve measuring the photon polarization in @xmath8 and the zero of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "our understanding of these decays has advanced considerably over the past few years , through the derivation of factorization relations for exclusive @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays at large recoil .",
    "first derived at lowest order in perturbation theory @xcite , these factorization theorems were proved to all orders in @xmath13 @xcite using the soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .    in this paper",

    "due to certain form factor relations at large recoil @xcite , this asymmetry has a zero at @xmath21 which depends mostly on wilson coefficients in the weak hamiltonian with little hadronic uncertainty .",
    "the position of the zero was computed in @xcite , using the complete leading order factorization formula .",
    "the most updated result , including isospin violation effects , is @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a radiative correction and @xmath24 denotes factorizable corrections which break the form factor relations .",

    "we propose an alternative test of the sm using the _ slope _ of the @xmath7 curve , which can be shown to contain the same information about the wilson coefficients as the location of the zero itself .",
    "in contrast to the absolute position of the zero , which depends on less well known hadronic parameters , the slope of the zero curve can be shown to be less sensitive to such effects .    in sec .",
