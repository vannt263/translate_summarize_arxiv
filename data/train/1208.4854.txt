    "any respectable list of desert island card games must include war to pass the time ( the expected length of a game is infinite , after all  @xcite ) .",
    "but to maintain your remembrance of things past , it s hard to beat the game of memory .",
    "memory is played with a deck of @xmath5 cards .",
    "the cards are numbered from @xmath6 up to @xmath0 , with each number appearing twice . the deck is shuffled and then the cards are laid face down in a tableau .",
    "a _ move _ consists of flipping first one card and then a second .",
    "if the cards match , both are removed from play and the current player moves again .",
    "otherwise , they are flipped back over and play passes to the next player .",
    "play ends when all pairs have been removed ; the player who has removed the most pairs is the winner .",
    "the _ length _ of a game is the total number of moves .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , strategy plays a role in the two - player version of the game  @xcite . in some situations it may not be to a player s advantage to acquire new information by flipping over a card that has not been flipped before .",
    "the reason is that her opponent also acquires the same information . in this exploration",
    "we consider the solitaire version of memory , in which strategy plays no part .",
    "many games , such as poker and go fish , do not fair well as one - person games .",
    "memory does , as long as one shifts the goal from collecting the largest number of pairs to collecting all pairs in the fewest moves . as an additional simplification ,",
    "we assume that the player has perfect memory",
    ".    you may find it helpful to play a few games of solitaire memory on your own .",
    "you can use some subset of an ordinary deck of cards ; play online at a number of websites , such as @xcite or @xcite ; or , as of this writing , find a computer version on the wall at the airport ( at least in houston or minneapolis ) .    in the solitaire version of memory , acquiring information by flipping over an unknown card",
    "is always helpful .",
    "it is therefore not hard to show that an optimal strategy is to proceed as described in algorithm  [ alg : strategy ] . throughout this paper , we assume that the player is using this optimal strategy .",
    "we consider three questions regarding this one - person game of memory .",
    "+    flip them over and remove them flip over an unknown card flip the mate and remove both flip over another unknown card ( and remove the pair if you are lucky enough to find the mate )    * 1 .",
    "what is the expected length of a game ( i.e. , how many moves are required ) ? * + each card must be flipped over at least once .",
    "if it is not matched the first time it is flipped over , then it is flipped again , and removed , once the location of its mate is known .",
    "thus , each card is flipped either once or twice , and therefore the total number of card flips is between @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "since two cards are flipped over on each move , this means that the number of moves in any game will be between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "analysis of the possibilities for the end of the game shows that the last card to be flipped over will only be flipped once , and therefore the length of the game can not be @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the length lies between @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "example  [ ex : extremal ] ( in section  [ sec : setup ] ) illustrates that both of these lengths are possible .",
    ", with logarithmic @xmath9-scale . on the right we use a linear @xmath9-scale and a restricted domain to highlight the fact that over @xmath10 of games for @xmath11 will have a length lying between @xmath12 and @xmath13.,title=\"fig : \" ] , with logarithmic @xmath9-scale . on the right",
    "we use a linear @xmath9-scale and a restricted domain to highlight the fact that over @xmath10 of games for @xmath11 will have a length lying between @xmath12 and @xmath13.,title=\"fig : \" ]    computer investigations indicate that the expected length of a game is roughly @xmath14 . in sections  [ sec :",
    "explen ] and [ sec : limsums ] we will determine the exact length , and show that it is approximately @xmath15 , with the error in this approximation approaching 0 as @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dist - percentage ] shows the distribution of game lengths for @xmath11 .",
    "the expected length in this case is about 160.8589 , and our approximation gives about 160.8593 .",
    "a _ lucky _ move is one in which the player flips two cards that have not been flipped before and they happen to match . note that a game of length @xmath0 is one in which every move is lucky .",
    "the second question , to be addressed in section  [ sec : sumdleven ] , is : + *",
    "2 . what is the expected number of lucky moves in a game ?",
    "* + early in the game , the player has little information about the locations of the various cards . in all likelihood , each card flipped over will be the first of its pair to be seen .",
    "but certainly by the @xmath17th flip , the player will begin encountering the mates of cards she has already seen .",
    "this brings us to our third and final question , to be addressed in section  [ sec : repeat ] : + * 3 .",
    "how many flips are required before the player should expect to have seen both cards of a pair ? *",
    "a game of memory is not affected by how the cards are physically laid out . in light of this",
    ", it will be convenient to assume that the cards are arranged in a single row . and",
    "since the cards are shuffled before they are laid out , when our strategy calls for the player to flip an unknown card , there is no advantage to flipping one particular unknown card in preference to another .",
    "we may therefore assume that unknown cards are simply flipped from left to right . with this convention , game play depends only on the order in which the cards are laid out .",
    "[ ex : n=6ex ] suppose that @xmath18 and the cards are laid out in the order @xmath19 play will proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "the player flips over the first two cards , which are a 1 and a 2 . since they do nt match , they are flipped back over .",
    "the player flips over the next card , which is another 1 . remembering that the first card was also a 1",
    ", the player flips the first card to get the match and removes the two 1s .",
    "the player flips the next two cards , which are a 6 and a 2 .",
    "they do nt match , so they are flipped back .",
    "the player now knows the locations of both 2s .",
    "she therefore flips them and removes them .",
    "the player flips the next two cards , which are both 3s .",
    "they match , so she removes them .",
    "since these cards had not been flipped before , this is an example of a lucky move .",
    "the player flips the next two cards : a 5 and a 4 .",
    "they do nt match , so they are flipped back .",
    "the player flips the next card , which is the second 4 . remembering that the previous card was also a 4 , she flips it and removes the two 4s .",
    "the player flips the second 5 , flips the first 5 again , and removes the two 5s .",
    "the player flips the second 6 , flips the first 6 again , and removes the two 6s .    [ ex : extremal ] we can now give examples of the shortest and longest possible games . if the cards are laid out in the order @xmath20 then the game will consist of @xmath0 lucky moves ; this is the shortest possible game .",
    "it is only slightly harder to illustrate the longest possible game .",
    "we will let you verify that if the cards are laid out in the order @xmath21 then it will take @xmath8 moves to complete the game .",
    "although we have presented all of our examples by specifying the order in which the cards are laid out , in fact game play depends on only the relative positions of the pairs .",
    "these relative positions can be visualized using the notion of an _",
    "interconnection network_. an interconnection network  @xcite consists of @xmath5 points along with @xmath0 endpoint - disjoint arcs that connect pairs of points .",
    "( equivalently , such a network encodes an involution without fixed points . )",
    "figure  [ fig : icnetwork ] illustrates two deals for @xmath18 along with the associated interconnection network , in which points labeled with the same number are connected by an arc .",
    "( the first of these deals is the one in example  [ ex : n=6ex ] above . )",
    "the two deals in figure [ fig : icnetwork ] differ only in the labels we have assigned to each pair of cards , and therefore the first deal leads to essentially the same game as the second .",
    "we wish to identify those games with the same underlying interconnection network . in general",
    ", there is an @xmath22-to-@xmath6 map from size-@xmath5 deals to size-@xmath5 interconnection networks .",
    "this map for @xmath23 is illustrated in figure  [ fig : icn - n2 ] .",
    "we prefer to remain in the realm of card games , so we designate a representative for each class of deals .",
    "we call a deal _ standard _ if , when the game is played , the pairs are removed in order from 1 to @xmath0",
    ". put another way , a deal is standard if the second occurrence of @xmath24 occurs to the left of the second occurrence of @xmath25 for each @xmath24 between 1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the deals in examples  [ ex : n=6ex ] and  [ ex : extremal ] are all standard .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the set of standard permutations of the multiset @xmath27 .",
    "at this point , we have reduced a game of memory to an element of some @xmath26 .",
    "we write these elements in one - line notation ( reminiscent of an actual row of cards ) .",
    "for example , define @xmath28 by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the element @xmath31 represents the game @xmath32 , in which the first and fourth cards are 2s and the second and third are 1s .    for completeness , we include a proof of the following formula for the number of inequivalent games of memory  that is , the cardinality of @xmath26 .    for @xmath33 , the number of standard games of memory on a deck of @xmath5 cards is @xmath34    the first equality involving the _",
    "double factorial _ function is true by definition .",
    "the second equality can be checked by simple algebra .",
    "we prove by induction that the number of games is given by the above product of odd integers .",
    "for @xmath35 the formula is trivially true .",
    "now suppose that @xmath36 .",
    "any standard deal of a deck of size @xmath5 can be constructed by adding two copies of @xmath0 to a standard deal of a deck of size @xmath37 . in order for the augmented deal to be standard",
    ", the second occurrence of @xmath0 must be at the end of the row .",
    "thus , there are @xmath38 possible locations for the first occurrence of @xmath0 .",
    "the lemma therefore follows by the principle of mathematical induction .",
    "fix @xmath39 . for any @xmath40 ,",
    "let @xmath41 denote the smallest index @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for some @xmath44 .",
    "in other words , @xmath41 is the position of the first card in @xmath31 that matches a previous card .",
    "since we are assuming that the deal is standard , this first matching card will be a 1 .",
    "let @xmath45 count the number of permutations @xmath46 for which @xmath47 .",
    "notice that @xmath41 is always between 2 and @xmath48 , so @xmath49 if @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "then for a randomly chosen @xmath52 , the probability that @xmath53 is @xmath54 and therefore the expected value of @xmath41 is @xmath55    it turns out that there is a simple formula for the numerator of the last fraction :    [ lem : expnum ] for every positive integer @xmath0 , @xmath56    we proceed by induction on @xmath0 . the equation is easily seen to be correct when @xmath35 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath57 , and the equation holds for @xmath58 .",
    "a permutation @xmath40 with @xmath59 can be constructed from a permutation in @xmath60 in one of two ways .",
    "the first way is to start with a permutation @xmath61 with @xmath62 , insert an @xmath0 into @xmath63 somewhere after position @xmath42 , and then add a second @xmath0 at the end .",

    "our main goal in this section is to prove the following theorem :    [ thm : main ] the expected length of a game with @xmath5 cards is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "consider any standard deal @xmath40 . in the game based on @xmath31",
    ", the player will turn over unknown cards two at a time until she comes to the first matching card at position @xmath41 .",
    "what happens at that point depends on whether @xmath41 is even or odd .",
    "if @xmath41 is odd , then the card at position @xmath41 , which is the second 1 , will be flipped over at the beginning of a move .",
    "since we are assuming that the player has perfect memory , she will then flip the first 1 and remove both 1s . the number of moves required to flip all the cards up to position @xmath41 and then remove the matching 1s is therefore @xmath78 . on the other hand",
    ", if @xmath41 is even then the card at position @xmath41 will be the second card flipped in a move .",
    "if the first card flipped in that move was also a 1 then the move is lucky and the two 1s are removed right away . if not , then it will take an additional move to flip the two 1s and remove them .",
    "thus , if @xmath41 is even then the number of moves to flip the first @xmath41 cards and remove the two 1s is either @xmath79 , if the first 1 is at position @xmath80 , or @xmath81 , if not .",
    "once the two 1s have been removed , the player continues by flipping the unknown card at position @xmath82 , and she again flips unknown cards two at a time until she reaches the next matching card , the second 2 . if the second 2 is at position @xmath83 , then as above the number of moves required to flip all of the cards from position @xmath82 to @xmath83 and remove the matching 2s is @xmath84 if @xmath85 is odd , @xmath86 if @xmath85 is even and the first 2 is at position @xmath87 , and @xmath88 otherwise .",
    "once the 2s have been removed , the player flips unknown cards two at a time until she finds the second 3 , and she continues in this way until all the pairs have been matched and removed .",
    "thus , we see that the second occurrences of each of the numbers from 1 to @xmath0 can be thought of as breaking the deal @xmath31 into @xmath0 blocks , with each block ending with a second occurrence .",
    "the function @xmath41 that we studied in the last section is the length of the first block , but we will have to consider the lengths of all of the blocks to determine the number of moves in the game .",
    "let the lengths of the blocks be @xmath89 , @xmath90 , ",
    ", @xmath91 , and notice that since the entire deck contains @xmath5 cards , @xmath92 .",
    "we will call a block _ lucky _ if the block has length at least 2 and the last two cards in the block match .",
    "the analysis above shows that the number of moves required to flip all of the cards in the @xmath24th block and then remove the two cards labeled @xmath24 is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is 1/2 if @xmath95 is odd , 0 if @xmath95 is even and the @xmath24th block is lucky , and 1 if @xmath95 is even and the @xmath24th block is not lucky .",
    "thus , if @xmath96 is the number of blocks in @xmath31 of even length and @xmath97 is the number of these even - length blocks that are lucky , then the length of the game is @xmath98    for example , if @xmath18 and @xmath31 is the deal given in example  [ ex : n=6ex ] , then the lengths of the blocks are 3 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 1 , and the third and fourth blocks are lucky .",
    "therefore @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and the length of the game is @xmath101 which is in agreement with our analysis of this game in example  [ ex : n=6ex ] .    to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] we will need to find the expected values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 : the expected number of even blocks and the expected number of lucky even blocks . to compute these",
    ", we will keep track of the number of blocks of each kind and each length among all of the @xmath102 standard deals . for",
    "any positive integer @xmath42 , let @xmath103 be the total number of blocks of length @xmath42 in all standard deals of a deck of @xmath5 cards , and for @xmath104 let @xmath105 be the total number of lucky blocks of length @xmath42 .",
    "the greatest possible length for a block is @xmath48 , so @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "the expected number of blocks of length @xmath42 is then @xmath108 and similarly the expected number of lucky blocks of length @xmath42 is @xmath109 using this notation , we can write the expected value of @xmath96 as @xmath110 , and the expected value of @xmath97 is @xmath111 .",
    "notice that , although we have written these expected values as infinite sums , in fact the sums are finite , since all but finitely many terms in each sum are 0 .",
    "thus the expected length of a game is @xmath112    there are several steps required to pass from equation  ( [ eq : lengthform ] ) to theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the first is to replace the @xmath113 and @xmath114 in  ( [ eq : lengthform ] ) with ( what turn out to be ) their asymptotic limits .",
    "we will show that , for large @xmath0 , @xmath115 we therefore define @xmath116 equivalently , @xmath117    we wish to rewrite using the asymptotic limits of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 . to this end , we first compute @xmath118 although the sum on the left - hand side is finite , the two sums on the right - hand side are infinite . however , it is not hard to see that these two infinite sums converge .",
    "indeed , we can evaluate the first one by using the partial fractions decomposition @xmath119 this gives us @xmath120 since the alternating harmonic series converges to @xmath3 .",
    "therefore @xmath121    next , we compute @xmath122 for the first part we again use a partial fractions decomposition : @xmath123 this gives us @xmath124 so @xmath125    combining , , and , we see that the expected length of the game is @xmath126    in the next section , we will show that @xmath127 substituting these values in will complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "in order to determine the limits required to complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] , we need to establish some facts about the @xmath128 and @xmath129 . to establish these facts , we begin by finding effective recurrences that can be used to compute @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "first we determine recurrences for the @xmath103 . if @xmath35 , then the only standard deal is @xmath131 , which has a single block of length 2 .",
    "so @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "for @xmath135 , as we saw before , any standard deal @xmath40 can be constructed from a standard deal @xmath61 by inserting an @xmath0 in one of the @xmath8 possible positions in @xmath63 and then adding a second @xmath0 at the end .",
    "now , what happens to the blocks of @xmath63 when this is done ?",
    "a block of length @xmath42 in @xmath63 either becomes a block of length @xmath136 ( if the first @xmath0 is inserted into that block ) or length @xmath42 ( if the first @xmath0 is inserted somewhere else ) . also , there is a new block at the end of length either 2 ( if both copies of @xmath0 are at the end ) or 1 ( if not ) .",
    "so , for @xmath137 : @xmath138 dividing by @xmath139 , we get corresponding recurrences for @xmath140 : @xmath141 , @xmath142 for @xmath134 , and for @xmath135 , @xmath143 finally , we use the definition of @xmath128 ( equation ) to convert these recurrences into recurrences for @xmath144 .",
    "[ lem : dbrec ] the numbers @xmath128 satisfy the following equations : @xmath145    the derivation of these equations involves only routine algebra .",
    "we illustrate by deriving the formula for @xmath146 : @xmath147    using these recurrences , we can now study the numbers @xmath128 .",
    "we begin by determining these numbers for small values of @xmath42 .",
