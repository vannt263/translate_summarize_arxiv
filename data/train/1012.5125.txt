    "magnetized and low density ( weakly collisional ) plasmas are known to present anisotropic pressures with respect to the magnetic field orientation , which can survive considerably long times compared to the dynamical timescales of certain systems . in astrophysical environments such pressure anisotropy may be generated by several different processes , such as kinetic pressure of cosmic rays , supernovae explosions , stellar winds , or anisotropic turbulent motions ( see quest and shapiro 1996 ) .    under certain conditions",
    "gyrotropic plasmas give rise to new wave modes and instabilities , which can not be studied by standard isotropic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model ( hasegawa 1969 , wang and hau 2003 , passot and sulem 2006 ) .",
    "for instance , hau and wang ( 2007 ) showed that gyrotropic magnetohydrodynamic equations closed by the chew - goldberger - low laws ( cgl - mhd ) lead to a positive density @xmath0 _ versus _ magnetic field strength @xmath1 correlations for the slow magnetosonic mode under certain conditions in contradiction to the standard mhd model .",
    "it was commonly believed that the detected absence of slow modes in several astrophysical sites was related to the strong damping of these waves . however , in the collisionless plasmas it could be explained by wrong identification of the positive @xmath2 correlations for fast magnetosonic modes .",
    "the pressure anisotropies give rise to plasma instabilities depending on the anisotropy ratio , e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the firehose and mirror instabilities , respectively .",
    "they are responsible for the growth of the magnetic energy and acceleration of particles .",
    "the predictions of the cgl - mhd model , including new plasma instabilities , are also important in weakly magnetized environments , since even a weak magnetic field is enough to change the motion of the charged particles and therefore increase the pressure anisotropy .    as an example of the possible applications sharma _ et al . _",

    "( 2006 ) showed the importance of the collisionless plasma approach in protostellar disks .",
    "they studied the role of the kinetic instabilities in the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) showing that the transport of angular momentum in the disk may be efficiently increased under certain circumstances .",
    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) is possibly the most suitable environment for studies of gyrotropic plasma effects ( schekochihin _ et al .",
    "considering typical parameters of @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 k and @xmath8 g ( ensslin and vogt 2006 ) , it is possible to show that the cyclotron frequency ( @xmath9 ) is much larger than the collision frequency ( @xmath10 ) . under such conditions , the plasma fluctuations with wave numbers",
    "@xmath111 kpc will be subject to different processes related to the pressure anisotropy . the turbulent cascade , for example ,",
    "may be modified by the new wave modes and instabilities resulting in a different picture of the energy budget in these environments",
    ". it may be particularly important in understanding of the cooling flow and the cosmic rays acceleration processes .",
    "schekochihin _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) showed that in the icm the anisotropy - induced firehose and mirror instabilities may grow non - linearly up to the saturation at @xmath12 .",
    "this growth is very fast .",
    "they estimated the increase of power at small scales .",
    "as a consequence , the excess of small scale fluctuations of @xmath1 and the energy transport at these environments may drastically change the picture . in certain cases the small scales may also be considered as collisionless , what may be important , for instance , in the development of turbulent cascade . for wavelengths smaller than the larmor radius",
    "the kinetic treatment of plasma is necessary , as shown by howes _",
    "however , in this work we focus on the large scale so the cgl - mhd approximation may be used instead .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide an extensive statistical analysis of the mhd turbulence in collisionless plasmas and to study the role of the different instabilities in the evolution of the system . to accomplish that we performed the first 3-dimensional simulations focusing on the evolution of turbulence in the presence of pressure anisotropy .",
    "the description of the model as well as the presentation of the governing equations is given in section  [ sec : cgl - mhd ] with additional discussion of the instabilities and the double - isothermal approximation . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we describe the numerical simulations .",
    "the results and the extensive statistical analysis including the derivation of probability distribution functions , spectra and structure functions of the fluctuations of density and velocity are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the most important results in section  [ sec : discuss ] followed by section  [ sec : conclusions ] , where we draw main conclusions .",
    "in the fluid approximation , a gyrotropic plasma can be described by the chew _",
    "et al . _ ( 1956 ) magnetohydrodynamic ( cgl - mhd henceforth ) equations expressed in the conservative form as follows : @xmath13 & = & { \\textbf{\\em f } } , \\label{eq : momentum } \\\\   { \\frac{\\partial { \\textbf{\\em b}}}{\\partial t } } - \\nabla \\times \\left ( { \\textbf{\\em v } } \\times { \\textbf{\\em b } } \\right ) & = & 0 , \\label{eq : magnetic_flux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the plasma density and velocity , respectively , @xmath16 is the magnetic field , @xmath17 is the pressure tensor , @xmath18 is the unit vector along the magnetic field , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the pressure components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath21 , respectively , and @xmath22 represents the forcing term .    the above set of equations is completed by the description of the parallel and perpendicular pressure components . to avoid the complexities related to explicitly calculated processes that may be important for the description of the energies , e.g. , the anisotropic heat conduction and the emission and absorption of the radiation",
    ", we can make use of the double - polytropic equations instead , as suggested by chew _",
    "et al . _ ( 1956 ) .",
    "tests of this approximation using the solar magnetosheath data confirmed its validity under the form ( see hau and sonnerup 1993 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the polytropic exponents for the perpendicular and parallel pressures , respectively .",
    "these equations , according to hau ( 2002 ) , can be expressed in the conservative form , as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the strength of magnetic field . in this form",
    ", the double - polytropic equations can be solved numerically similarly as the continuity equation .      under the double - isothermal closure",
    "we have @xmath30 and the equation of state is described by two relations , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants and represent speeds of sound along the perpendicular and parallel directions to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "in such situation the conservative form of the momentum equation for the double - isothermal cgl - mhd model can be rewritten as follows , @xmath35 = { \\textbf{\\em f}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the pressure anisotropy ratio , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the plasma betas in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the local field , respectively .",
    "the main consequence of the double - isothermal closure is that the pressure anisotropy is kept constant , i.e. @xmath40 , independently of the evolution of the kinetic instabilities that may arise .",
    "therefore , the stability condition is fulfilled by the local decrease of density and the increase of magnetic pressure and not due to the local changes of the pressure tensor .",
    "furthermore , this work is focused on studying the differences of the turbulent regimes in the collisionless plasmas and the standard mhd turbulence using as the reference the studies done by kowal _",
    "( 2007 ) , kowal and lazarian ( 2010 ) , where the authors presented an extensive statistical analysis of density , velocity and magnetic field distributions in the isothermal mhd simulations .",
    "for this reason we chose the double - isothermal cgl - mhd model as the natural extension of the isothermal mhd in order to understand the importance of pressure anisotropy and its consequences in the turbulent plasmas .",
    "while in the mhd model the dispersion relations do not exhibit any instabilities , in the cgl - mhd equations the term of the pressure anisotropy introduces significant changes to the dynamical system . the detailed linearization and wave analysis of the double - isothermal cgl - mhd equations",
    "is provided in the appendix .",
    "here we describe the final dispersion formulas resulting from the presence of pressure anisotropy .",
    "for example , in the case of the incompressible alfvn mode , the dispersion relation can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the angle between the mean field and the wave vector of the perturbation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : alfven_dispersion ] ) becomes negative when @xmath44 , what results in the occurrence of the firehose instability and the growth of the magnetic field fluctuations . as a consequence ,",
    "the field lines bend and the magnetic pressure increases reducing the parameter @xmath45 to its saturation value @xmath46 .",
    "this is known as the kinetic alfvn firehose instability .",
    "two other instabilities related to the slow mode are called the compressible firehose and mirror instabilities and occur when @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively , and the dispersion relation for magnetosonic waves becomes negative ( see appendix ) .",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath47 ( right panel ) . on the horizontal axis",
    "we show the plasma beta parameter related to the parallel pressure and defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the magnetic pressure . on the vertical axis",
    "we show the squared sinus of the angle between the directions of the perturbation and mean field .",
    "[ fig : stability],title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left panel ) and @xmath47 ( right panel ) . on the horizontal axis we show the plasma beta parameter related to the parallel pressure and defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the magnetic pressure . on the vertical axis",
    "we show the squared sinus of the angle between the directions of the perturbation and mean field .",
    "[ fig : stability],title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure  [ fig : stability ] we show the stability regimes for two cases of the pressure anisotropy studied in this paper , @xmath50 in the left panel and @xmath47 in the right one ( corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ) , plotted as functions of the plasma beta @xmath38 related to the parallel pressure and the squared sinus of the angle between the directions of the perturbation propagation and magnetic field .",
    "when the perpendicular pressure dominates ( left panel ) only the mirror instability corresponding to the slow mode can occur .",
    "when perturbations propagate in directions almost perpendicular to the magnetic field the range of unstable @xmath38 grows . on the contrary , when the direction of propagation is close to the direction of magnetic field the instability does not occur . in the case of dominating parallel pressure ( right panel )",
    "the plasma becomes unstable due to two firehose instabilities related to the incompressible alfvn and compressible slow modes , but the alfvn mode firehose instability extends over larger region of the parameter space up to @xmath53 independently of the angle between the perturbation propagation and magnetic field directions .",
    "both instabilities have the growth rate @xmath54 larger at smaller scales , i.e. , increasing with the wave number @xmath55 .",
    "this dependence introduces a stiffness in the numerical integration since the micro instabilities , which may be due to the numerical imprecision , tend to grow very fast and destroy the configuration of the studied problem . as a consequence",
    ", the pressure anisotropy tends to disappear quickly and the problem of interest can not be studied .",
    "( 2006 ) studying the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) in protostellar disks pointed out this important problem .",
    "they bypassed it by implementing a quasi - stability condition for the computational cells where the pressure anisotropy was larger than the threshold for instability .",
    "physically , it can be understood as an almost `` instantaneous '' evolution of the system to the quasi - stable condition . under such condition",
    "all anisotropic effects are kept at the large scales and the problem of interest could be analyzed .",
    "the downside of this method is that it artificially removes the free energy of pressure anisotropy without , as a counterpart , increasing the kinetic and/or magnetic energies .",
    "that is because , in the physical sense , the instability increases the magnetic energy and/or accelerate the gas .",
    "in the case of turbulence this kind of artificial removal of the energy at small scales may not be the best approach since the small scale structures in turbulence are generated by the cascade process operating in the turbulent models and therefore by artificially influencing the dissipation of energy we can distort its physical meaning and obtain incorrect conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , under the double - isothermal approximation the pressure anisotropy is kept even after the growth of the small scale perturbations saturates , so the stability condition at large scales may lay in the unstable region even after the saturation at small scales .",
    "therefore , under certain conditions , the double - isothermal approximation is valid and might be an interesting area of studies of the evolution of turbulence in a collisionless plasma .",
    "the simulations of turbulence in collisionless plasma were performed solving the set of double - isothermal cgl - mhd equations in a conservative form given by equations  ( [ eq : mass])-([eq : magnetic_flux ] ) with an addition term @xmath22 in the motion equation representing the turbulence driving .",

    "interesting modifications from mhd turbulence was also shown from the spectral anisotropy regarding the global magnetic field . however , since the instabilities are dominant at small scales , mapping the structure functions regarding the local magnetic field seems to be a better approach if we want to determine the role of the instabilities on the isotropization of fluctuations .",

    "otherwise , the magnetic field topology would not change drastically , but the interchange of energy would cause a reduction of parallel pressure anyway . in this sense , the result would be the same , i.e. the firehose instability is responsible for a isotropization of the fluctuations with respect to the magnetic field lines .",
    "model 1 , on the other hand , presented a larger anisotropy for the cgl - mhd model . here , as @xmath86 , the free energy is mostly converted to kinetic pressure .",
    "the mirror instability is responsible for an increase in the acceleration of the plasma along the field lines ( as already seen in the pdf of velocity ) , increasing the anisotropy of the fluctuations .",
    "the result is more elongated structures , mostly at small and intermediate scales , as also noticed in the power spectra .",
    "in order to understand the evolution of the system during the growth and saturation of the instabilities , we calculated the instability condition for the alfvn and the compressible modes for each cell of the computational domain .",
    "the dispersion relation of these modes reveal the cells where the instability condition is fulfilled .         as a general behavior",
    ", we found that the turbulence increases the range of unstable cells , even for the case with initially stable cells ( model 6 ) .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure  [ fig : stab_cond ] where we show the time evolution of the dispersion relation of model 4 ( similar distributions were obtained for all models ) .",
    "here , we plot the histograms of the stability condition for different times .",
    "the alfvn and magnetosonic modes are independently shown in the left and right plots , respectively .",
    "unstable cells populate the negative range of the dispersion relation . the time is shown in units of the dynamical timescale @xmath99 .    as the turbulence is injected in the simulation domain , fluctuations of density and magnetic field change the local characteristic speeds and , as a consequence , the stability conditions .",
    "this process is fast compared to the dynamical timescale of the system ( @xmath100 ) . as a result ,",
    "the dispersion relation spread over a larger range including the negative values of @xmath101 .",
    "then , the instabilities start to grow and saturate , at different timescales for different scales .",
    "the saturation of the instability brings the cells towards positive values of @xmath101 . at @xmath102 ,",
    "most of cells have already reached the saturation condition for both modes .",
    "we believe that the few still unstable conditions are related to the large scale fluctuations , which evolve slow and has higher saturation values .",
    "it also seems that the firehose instability of alfvn modes saturates faster than the magnetosonic mode , though the differences between the modes could be also be related to the driving mechanism .",
    "we plan to address this possibility in a future work .    in the present calculations we did not perform any wave mode decomposition and ,",
    "therefore we were unable to analyze the time evolution of the individual modes . also , for this reason we are unable to characterize the time evolution for each wavelength ( scale ) .",

    "we studied the case of double - isothermal closure of the cgl - mhd equations in order to compare our results with previous isothermal simulations of mhd turbulence .",
    "we performed simulations with different characteristic sonic and alfvenic mach numbers , as well as different pressure anisotropies to account for both firehose and mirror instabilities .",
