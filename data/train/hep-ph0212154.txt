    "over the past 10 years , due in no small part to the quality and extent of data collected at the hera and tevatron colliders , the field of rapidity gap physics has flourished . as a result , in a review talk like this i can not hope to cover anything other than a few topics , chosen to reflect my personal bias .",
    "the next section will focus on the hard diffractive production of jets and higgs bosons , and will draw on data collected at both hera and the tevatron . in section 3 ,",
    "i discuss the dipole model of diffraction and the evidence for saturation . in section 4",
    ", i turn to rapidity gaps with a large momentum transfer across the gap .",
    "these are rarer but rather clean processes , and recent high quality data on vector meson production has allowed comparison with theory , which i discuss .",
    "i will follow the conventional language and classify hard diffractive processes as shown in figure [ fig : diffrac ] .",
    "@xmath0 is some hard scale ( e.g. jet transverse momentum , @xmath1 mass etc . )",
    "characteristic of the system @xmath2 . in `` double pomeron exchange '' , which has been measured at the tevatron @xcite , the protons remain intact , losing only a small fraction of their initial energy , so that the system @xmath2 is produced centrally . in single diffraction",
    ", only one proton remains intact and fast , and the system @xmath2 is distant from it in rapidity .        at hera ,",
    "single diffraction of a virtual photon ( virtuality @xmath3 ) has allowed experimenters to probe the partonic structure of the diffractive exchange @xcite .",
    "appealing to regge theory , one can attempt to write the cross - section as a product of a pomeron flux factor @xmath4 and a pomeron parton density function , as shown in figure [ fig : regge ] .",
    "the experimenters parameterise the flux factor as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fraction of the incoming proton s energy carried by the pomeron , @xmath7 is the momentum transfer to the scattered proton , @xmath8 is the diffractive slope and @xmath9 is the pomeron trajectory .",
    "the experimenters are able to fit all their data on the diffractive structure function using a parameterisation of this form after evolving the parton density functions using the nlo evolution equations .",
    "h1 finds a pomeron intercept @xmath10 and no need for secondary regge exchanges for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "h1 has now extracted the pomeron quark and gluon density functions with an estimate of the error , see fig .",
    "[ fig : h1partons ] .",
    "note that it is the gluon at large @xmath12 which is least well constrained .",
    "if the notion of a universal pomeron parton density function is to be tested , one needs to take the partons as measured in diffractive dis , and use them to predict the rates for other processes . at hera",
    "this programme has been carried out quite extensively and on the whole there is good agreement @xcite",
    ". however , there are indications that the dis partons do tend to lead to an overestimate of the data collected off real photons .",
    "good agreement can be arranged if one is prepared to accept an overall renormalisation by a factor of about @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the need for such a renormalisation violates universality .",
    "this should not come as a surprise ; we already knew that universality should not hold across the board in diffraction @xcite .",
    "what would be of interest is if the violation can be understood .",
    "simple ( eikonal ) models predict that rapidity gaps will be filled in by secondary interactions in those processes where the incoming beam particles have structure , which is the case in hadron - hadron interactions and photon - hadron interactions with an on - shell photon .",
    "these simple models also predict that the filling in of gaps can be approximated by an overall multiplicative factor which is weakly process dependent ; depending primarily on the overall centre - of - mass energy @xcite . in this way we can understand a gap survival factor of @xmath14 at hera .",
    "the eikonal models also predict a survival factor of around @xmath15 at the tevatron ( the high centre - of - mass energy being the main reason for the reduction since it liberates more low-@xmath16 partons ) .",
    "the burning question is therefore : `` how does a gap survival factor of 0.1 , in conjunction with the latest h1 parton density functions , stand up to the tevatron data ? '' . at first sight ,",
    "the answer is `` very badly '' . in table",
    "[ tab : teva ] , we show the original calculations of @xcite , which are parton level and do not contain any gap survival factor . comparison is to cdf and d0 data available at the time ( some of which were preliminary ) .",
    "the references shown in the table are to the final published papers .",
    "the pomeron parton densities do not now agree with the most recent hera data , but they are not so far out to account for the obvious problems .",
    "even with a gap survival of @xmath17 , things look bleak .",
    ".problems at the tevatron ?",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : rob ]          it has been suggested that the double pomeron exchange process could be utilized at the lhc to produce new particles , in particular the higgs boson @xcite . if the higgs is produced exclusively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs ] , then one could reconstruct its mass quite accurately ( to within 1 gev @xcite ) by tagging the outgoing protons .",
    "moreover , the exclusive nature of the central system leads to a significant suppression of qcd backgrounds , so that one could utilise the @xmath18 decay of the higgs with a much better @xmath19 compared to the non - diffractive production mechanism .",
    "khoze , martin and ryskin ( kms ) calculate the rate for the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs ] and find 3  fb for a 115 gev higgs decaying to @xmath18 at the lhc , which should be sufficiently large to permit a good measurement .",
    "it is possible to test the reliability of this estimate by performing the corresponding calculation for exclusive central dijet production ( i.e. replace the higgs by a dijet pair ) .",
    "kms predicted a rate of around 1  nb at the tevatron , which is to be compared to the cdf upper limit of 4  nb @xcite , i.e. the process has not been seen in run i data .",
    "however , with the increase in data from run ii , and the fact that d0 now has roman pot detectors in both forward and backward directions , it should be possible to check the kms calculation .",
    "complementary to the regge picture of diffraction in photon induced reactions is the dipole picture , to which we now turn our attention . in the proton rest frame ,",
    "the incoming photon converts into a @xmath20 pair a long distance upstream of the proton . in the diffractive limit , the quarks are highly energetic and travel along straight lines through the proton , picking up a non - abelian phase factor , before eventually forming the diffracted system @xmath2 way downstream of the proton , see fig . [ fig : dipoles ] .",
    "consequently , one can write down expressions for a variety of diffractive process , e.g. for the total @xmath21 cross - section at high - energy we only need the imaginary part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude , i.e. @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cross - section for scattering a colour dipole of transverse size @xmath24 and energy fraction @xmath25 off a proton .",
    "it is universal in that the same dipole cross - section should appear in other processes , such as diffractive vector meson production , where one simply replaces the outgoing photon wavefunction with the meson wavefunction @xcite .",
    "there is clearly a lot of physics in the dipole cross - section , including the qcd evolution of the original dipole .",
    "apart from the total @xmath21 cross - section ( and hence the structure functions , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and vector meson production , the dipole formalism has been used to compare to data on inclusive diffractive dis ( @xmath29 ) , deeply virtual compton scattering and shadowing off nuclei .    in the dipole model of golec - biernat & wsthoff",
    "@xcite , the dipole cross - section was parameterized as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 is called the saturation radius , since for larger @xmath24 the cross - section flattens off .",
    "since the saturation radius moves to smaller @xmath24 as @xmath16 decreases this model naturally tames the powerlike behaviour of the total cross - section as one moves to smaller @xmath16 . for small enough @xmath24 , the cross - section goes like @xmath34 which generates bjorken scaling .",
    "the striking agreement of the model with data @xmath26 and on @xmath29 originally led to the idea that hera was already probing the non - linear dynamics of saturation .",
    "subsequent , more detailed studies using the latest data , have revealed that it is not possible to fit the data with a pure power , i.e. @xmath35 , which gets tamed by saturation effects .",
    "it is necessary to replace the exponent with the gluon density @xcite , i.e. @xmath36 the gluon density itself becomes less steep as @xmath3 falls and so the exponentation is less important .",
    "this means that the regime of large corrections arising from the non - linear dynamics is pushed beyond the hera region , i.e. to smaller @xmath16 .",
    "the need to go beyond the original model of golec - biernat & wsthoff is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gbwslope ] where the effective slope ( @xmath37 ) is shown as a function of @xmath3 . in the original model , this slope asymptotes to just below 0.3 and deviations at lower @xmath3 are wholly attributed to saturation dynamics . in the new model , there is no flattening at high @xmath3 .",
    "structure function .",
    "solid curve is the new dipole model , whilst the dashed curve is that from the original golec - biernat & wsthoff model .",
    "( figure from @xcite ) ]    a quite different approach can be found in @xcite . here",
    "the dipole cross - section is written as a sum of two terms each of which can be thought of as arising from a pure regge pole ( of intercepts 1.06 and 1.4 respectively ) .",
    "this `` two pomeron '' model has no saturation dynamics at all .",
    "the reduction of the effective slope at low @xmath3 arises because of the dominance of the pomeron with lower intercept in that region ( the reverse occuring at high @xmath3 ) .",
    "this model is also able to describe the available data , including the diffractive structure function @xmath29 @xcite and deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite .    before leaving dipoles",
    ", i should say a few things about the latest theoretical progress in the physics of saturation .",
    "the use of non - linear perturbative qcd dynamics to control the growth of low-@xmath16 cross - sections has a long history , dating back to the `` glr equation '' of the early 1980 s @xcite .",
    "more recently , the balitsky - kovchegov equation has been developed to describe the non - linear evolution of the s - matrix for scattering a colour dipole off a hadronic target @xcite .",
    "underpinning all of this is the colour - glass - dynamics of @xcite .",
    "formulated as an effective field theory ( analogous to that of glasses in condensed matter physics ) , the colour glass dynamics describes the quantum evolution of soft gluons in a classical background colour field .",
    "it reduces to the bfkl equation in the approximation of a dilute background , and to the balitsky - kovchegov equation in the large @xmath38 limit .",
    "so far , all the processes we have looked at are close to @xmath39 , i.e. the outgoing proton(s ) do not receive a large transverse momentum .",
    "let us now focus on the case the @xmath40 . in this case , the incoming proton will typically be shattered .",
    "it is thought that the largeness of the momentum transfer will allow us to utilise qcd perturbation theory and hence to test the relevance of bfkl dynamics in these processes .       vector meson production .",
    "( figure from @xcite ) ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mesons ] we show the diffractive production of a high @xmath41 vector meson , @xmath42 .",
    "the large momentum transfer across the gap , @xmath43 , almost always breaks up the proton and leads to a jet in the resultant debris .",
    "the non - perturbative dynamics is factorised into either the proton parton density functions or into the meson lightcone wavefunction , and qcd can be used to compute the dynamics of the exchange .",
    "the fact that @xmath44 ensures that there is still a large rapidity gap between the proton dissociation products and the vector meson .    in leading order",
    ", bfkl predicts that the hard subprocess cross - section for scattering off quarks ( gluons differ only by a colour factor ) should go like @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46    comparison of the leading order bfkl calculation with the zeus data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] @xcite .",
    "the calculation is a fit to the data with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the free parameters .",
    "the fit shown corresponds to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "good agreement is also found ( with the same parameters ) with the data on the @xmath52 and @xmath53 mesons @xcite .",
    "note that it is not possible to get good agreement in the approximation that only two - gluons are exchanged between the diquark system and the struck parton .",
    "the above curves were computed assuming a very simple form for the meson wavefunction .",
    "in particular , it is assumed that the quarks share equally the momentum of the meson .",
    "relativistic corrections to this simple approximation have been considered @xcite and do not appear to spoil the good agreement @xcite .",
    "inclusion of relativistic corrections also allows one to quantify the degree to which the helicity of the meson differs from that of the photon , and comparison with data is once again encouraging @xcite .    in the future",
    ", data will become available on high-@xmath7 photon production .",
    "this is something to look forward to , since it avoids the uncertainty associated with the production of the vector meson .          as well as vector meson production",
    ", one can look for rapidity gaps between jets in photon - hadron and hadron - hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "the typical final state topology is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lego ] , where two jets are produced far apart in rapidity and there is a gap between the jets .",
    "early measurements at hera @xcite and the tevatron @xcite have been compared to theory and leading order bfkl does fine @xcite .",
    "however , conclusive statements are hard to make either because the gap is not large enough ( i.e. the excess over non - bfkl qcd is small ) or hadronisation corrections are large @xcite",
    ".        there has been significant recent progress , both experimentally and theoretically in this area which has to some extent shifted interest away from bfkl dynamics and into the domain of jet energy flows .",
    "h1 has focussed on the definition of the gap .",
    "they use the @xmath54 cluster algorithm to put all hadrons into jets , after which they select the two highest @xmath41 jets . the summed transverse energy between these two jets ( @xmath55 )",
    "is then used to define a gap . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1 ] , for low @xmath55 , one can really speak of a rapidity gap and a very clear excess is seen in the data over the standard monte carlos , whilst at larger values of @xmath55 the enhancement is less pronounced @xcite . by defining their gaps this way ,",
    "h1 has reduced its sensitivity to soft gluon radiation by effectively cleaning up the edge of the gap in a way which makes possible direct comparison with future theoretical calculations .    on the theoretical side , dasgupta & salam",
    "have recently pointed out that there is a previously unconsidered mechanism which ought to be considered when considered interjet energy flows @xcite . in particular , they have discovered a class of `` non - global '' logarithms which ought to be summed at the single logarithm level .",
    "the key conclusions of this talk can be summarised as follows :    * regge factorisation and qcd evolution work well to describe diffractive deep inelastic scattering at hera * hera partons may well be useful at the tevatron provided one accounts for gap survival at a level of around @xmath56 .",
    "tevatron measurements at lower @xmath6 would help .",
    "* there is a need to measure exclusive central dijet production at tevatron run ii in order to constrain diffractive higgs cross - sections at the lhc . *",
    "position on saturation is not clear .",
    "ideally one would like to go to lower @xmath16 .",
    "* high-@xmath7 vector meson production is well described by leading order bfkl .",
