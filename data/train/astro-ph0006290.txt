    "the study of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies presents an enormous observational challenge .",
    "lsb galaxies often too faint for more than limited optical study by broadband imaging .",
    "spectroscopy and near - ir are practically impossible due to the fact that too few galaxy photons are emitted per square arcsec compared to the brightness of the night sky .",
    "even a nominal number of hst orbits requires rebinning to obtain reliable s / n , which then loses the high resolution advantage of space imaging .",
    "however , one intrinsic characteristic has provided an avenue to study this class of galaxies , a majority of lsb galaxies contain copious amounts of neutral hydrogen ( schombert 1992 , impey 1996 ) .",
    "this provides both a quick method to confirm the reality of objects , barely visible in the optical , while simultaneously providing their distance and crude kinematic information .",
    "dwarf galaxies are the most numerous class of galaxies in the hubble sequence forming a large component of the number density of galaxies .",
    "for example , over 80% of the local group are classed as dwarfs and their space densities are higher even in cluster environments .",
    "they are found in all types of environments , from dense clusters to the field .",
    "they span the range of morphological types , from elliptical to highly irregular . and they cover a full range of current star formation rates , from quiescent de s to intense bcd s ( sandage and binggeli 1984 ) .",
    "although dwarf galaxies are low in metallicity ( skillman and kennicutt 1993 ) , they are by no means zero - metallicity protogalaxies . and ,",
    "while dwarf galaxies are interesting for their internal properties and star formation histories , they also serve as probes to the characteristics of dark matter ( ashman 1992 ) and are tracers of large scale structure ( eder 1989 , zwaan 1995 ) .    despite numerous studies on cluster and field dwarfs ,",
    "it is still unclear whether dwarf galaxies are a continuation of the spiral sequence or whether they form a distinct population , possibly fossil remnants from the era of galaxy formation .",
    "information about the gas content of dwarf galaxies is therefore critical to an understanding of their place in the hierarchy of galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge of the properties of dwarf irregulars is hampered by small catalogs because of difficulty in detecting them due to their lsb nature and small angular size . in order to improve the sample of dwarf irregular galaxies available for study , we have identified a new sample of 458 candidate dwarfs from inspection of 49 fields of the new palomar sky survey ( pss - ii ) directed towards the north and south galactic caps .",
    "previous papers have presented the catalog and the optical data ( eder 1989 , schombert , pildis , and eder 1997 , pildis , schombert and eder 1997 ) .",
    "this paper presents the single - dish arecibo 21 cm data for this sample and determines the dynamical mass for dwarfs with optical measurements .",
    "the impact of these parameters on the star formation history of lsb dwarfs is explored in a latter paper ( schombert , mcgaugh and eder 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper , we report on the 21 cm observations of three samples of dwarf galaxy candidates selected visually from photographic plates of the second palomar sky survey ( pss - ii ) .",
    "all of the samples were chosen so as to optimize their observation with the arecibo radio telescope , meaning they lie between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in declination . the first sample ( sample 1 ) of 178 candidates was obtained from 15 fields located on regions of the fall sky occupied by a nearby void .",
    "the plates used were high quality preproduction plates .",
    "of these candidates , 132 were observed at 21 cm .",
    "the void is centered at ra = 0h45 m , dec = + 20 , v = 3500 km sec@xmath10 , and is of roughly spherical shape with a diameter of 1500 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "the second sample ( sample 2 ) of 278 was identified using methods similar to those for the first sample from 35 random fields between ra s of 7h to 16h and dec s of 10 to 25 , irrespective of galaxy density . of these , all",
    "were observed at 21 cm . the third much smaller sample of 27 ( sample 3 ) consisted of new dwarf candidates identified from a visual reexamination of one of the fields of sample 1 ( field 409 ) , using the final pss - ii production plates .",
    "sample 3 also included observations of some of the dwarf candidates from sample 1 which were not originally observed with 21 cm due to a lack of telescope time .",
    "all objects on the plates with angular diameters greater than 20 arcsecs , irregular appearance ( sm , i m , irr , di ) and low surface brightness were selected .",
    "low mass implies instability , at least with respect to the pattern of star formation .",
    "thus , irregular structure is nominally associated with dwarf galaxies ( unless the star formation is completed , as in a dwarf elliptical ) .",
    "basically , late - type galaxies can be broken down into three morphological types ; those with bulges and lsb disks ( sc and sd class , those with apparent axial symmetry but no bulges ( sm class ) and those with no symmetry ( i m class ) .",
    "however , morphology is only weakly related to the mass of a galaxy .",
    "there are many irregular galaxies that are massive ( hunter and gallagher 1986 ) and many spirals which are dwarf - like in luminosity and size ( schombert 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , many high luminosity events , such as galaxy - galaxy interactions , are also associated with irregular morphology , although usually of a nature that identifies them as tidal in origin .",
    "irregular morphology , by itself , is not a sufficient criteria for dwarf classification , but is sufficient for the development of a candidate list .",
    "the coordinates of each candidate dwarf were taken directly from the plate material using a fine ruler and the position of sao stars .",
    "accuracy of the coordinates were typically @xmath1115 arcsecs based on the centering of ccd imaging , which is sufficient for detection with the arecibo beam of 3 arcmin diameter .",
    "further details of the selection of the three samples can be found in our previous papers : eder 1989 ( sample 1 ) and schombert , pildis , and eder 1997 ( samples 2 and 3 ) .",
    "follow - up ccd images in v and i for most of those galaxies detected in h i from sample 2 were obtained on the hiltner 2.4 m telescope located at michigan - dartmouth - m.i.t .",
    "( mdm ) observatory .",
    "we obtained images using either a thomson 400@xmath12576 pixel ccd ( 0.25 arcsec pixel@xmath10 ) or a ford - loral 2048@xmath122048 pixel ccd binned 3@xmath123 ( 0.51 arcsec pixel@xmath13 ) , with minimal exposure times of 25 minutes in johnson @xmath14 and 15 minutes in johnson @xmath15 .",
    "analysis of these images reveal that the candidates are gas - rich dwarf galaxies with total luminosities of @xmath16 mags , central surface brightnesses between 21 and 23 i mags arcsec@xmath4 , exponential scale lengths of typically less than 3 kpc and mean isophotal diameters ( of approximately the holmberg diameter ) of 8 kpc ( as compared with a mean of 30 kpc for the ugc galaxies , pildis , schombert and eder 1997 ) .",
    "a sample of comparable size to ours would be the virgo cluster dwarfs ( hoffman 1997 ) but these dwarfs reside in a cluster environment while ours inhabit a range of environmental densities .",
    "we observed the dwarf candidates for the hi line at 21 cm with the arecibo 305 m telescope during the 1988 , 1992 and 1993 observing season .",
    "all observations were made with the 21 cm dual - circular feed positioned to provide a maximum gain ( 8 k jy@xmath10 ) at 1400 mhz .",
    "the 2048 channel autocorrelator was used and the independent , opposite polarized signals were each divided into two subcorrelators of 512 channels . in order to search a larger velocity space , the secondary local oscillators of each polarization set of subcorrelators were offset on either side of the standard local oscillator frequency of 260 mhz by 8.75 mhz , allowing a total velocity coverage of 8000 km sec@xmath10 , a velocity resolution of 8.6 km sec@xmath10 , and some overlap at the band edges .",
    "the observations were centered on 4000 km sec@xmath10 , which avoided detection of the strong galactic hydrogen signal on the low - velocity end , and extended to 8120 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "observations were made in the total power mode with 5 minute on- source and off - source observations . in most cases ,",
    "only one 5-minute on - source integration was required for detection . wherever possible ,",
    "the zenith angle was kept less than 14 degrees to minimize the degradation of the gain .",
    "efforts were made to assure that the signal was due to the candidate galaxy .",
    "the field of each position was examined on the original plates and also with ned to check for possible sources of confusion . because many of the detections were very narrow , the possibility existed that they were actually caused by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "however , rfi confusion can be distinguished by their polarization properties and/or , with 3-level sampling , by the ringing they cause in the band which is eliminated with hanning smoothing .",
    "those narrow detections that were still suspicious were reobserved to confirm their authenticity .",
    "higher resolution observations of several narrow line detections revealed double - horned features .",
    "all three samples were analyzed and reduced in the same fashion .",
    "calibration of the spectra for atmospheric correction and noise diode variation with frequency was performed during the phase of translation into export format for compatibility with the arecibo observatory analyz - galpac analysis system .",
    "baseline fitting , removal , and parameter extraction were all performed using the latter package .",
    "the width , referred to hereafter as @xmath17 , is defined as the full width across the profile measured at a level of 50% of the peak flux .    in table 1",
    "we present the results of the analysis for the 250 galaxies whose digital spectra have been examined .",
    "in addition , 143 galaxies which were searched for , but not detected , are also listed in table 1 .",
    "the nominal search range was 1000 to 8,000 km sec@xmath10 , with occasional extensions to 12,000 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "the typical rms values were 3 mjy .",

    "the dynamical mass is determined from the virial theorem using the prescription of staveley - smith , davies and kinman ( 1992 , hereafter sdk ) .",
    "however , to complicate matters , ellipticity studies indicate that dwarf galaxies are primarily triaxal with particular signatures in their structural parameters that confirm their non - oblate nature ( schombert , mcgaugh and eder 2000 ) .",
    "if dwarf galaxies are not oblate rotators , then as discussed in sdk , the use of a pure rotation term to calculate the dynamical mass will underestimate this value by as much as 30% .",
    "hence , we adopt sdk s virial mass estimate , @xmath25 , as given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the rotation velocity , @xmath28 is the isotropic velocity dispersion and @xmath29 is the outer radius of the hi emission .",
    "the velocity dispersion is assumed to be 10 km sec@xmath10 , the standard value for late - type galaxies ( shostak and van der kruit 1984 ) .",
    "high resolution hi maps of gas - rich dwarf galaxies also indicate a typical velocity dispersion of 10 km sec@xmath10 ( skillman 1988 , lo 1993 ) . note that , for dwarfs without rotation , @xmath27 could be replaced with @xmath28 and the dynamical masses is underestimated by a factor of 3 , but we have assumed rotation in our discussion .",
    "we calculate @xmath27 from the measured hi profile width , correcting for inclination and velocity dispersion such that    @xmath30    where the inclination , @xmath31 , is determined from the axial ratio of the outer isophotes of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the remaining variable is @xmath29 , the radius of the edge of the hi emission .",
    "we can measure @xmath24 , the radius of the 25 @xmath32 mag arcsec@xmath4 isophote directly from the optical images .",
    "mapping studies indicate that the hi diameter of dwarf galaxies is much larger than the optical radius .",
    "van zee , skillman and salzer ( 1998 ) found that the hi diameter is approximately 4 times the optical radius for a mapping study of 5 dwarfs .",
    "however , these dwarfs were selected as having an overabundance of hi .",
    "salpeter and hoffman ( 1996 ) discovered a correlation between optical and hi radius , such that @xmath33 for a sample of 109 dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "based on this evidence , we have set @xmath34 for the dwarf sample and determined all scale length values based on this conversion .",
    "the calculated values @xmath25 are listed in table 2 along with the ratio of @xmath35 .",
    "our understanding of dwarf galaxies , their properties , contents and star formation histories , has changed sharply , mostly because our catalogs of dwarf galaxies have expanded in the last decade .",
    "our initial view of dwarf galaxies were based on our studies of the lmc , smc and other irr class galaxies in the local group ( holmberg 1957 ) and low luminosity dwarf spheriodals such as leo a. these objects , although interesting in their own right , do not properly represent the range in mass , appearance and star formation history that define what we consider today to be the class of dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , in the late 1950 s , de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) extended the late - type hubble classes into the sd , sm and i m types to delineate the gradual loss of spiral structure .",
    "most of these extreme late - type galaxies would later be defined as dwarfs based on their optical magnitudes ( see sandage and binggeli 1984 ) ; however , they do not define the dwarf galaxy population .",
    "inspection of nearby clusters ( virgo and fornax ) revealed an extensive population of gas - poor elliptical dwarfs and gas - rich irregular dwarfs , subsequently called de and di to indicate their morphologically link to ordinary ellipticals and irregulars .",
    "the similarities between the dwarf ellipticals and irregulars to their giant counterparts ( such as mass - metallicity relations , fundamental plane parameters and star formation ) did appear to simplify the hubble sequence as one divided by morphological class on one axis and by luminosity ( and therefore mass ) on the other .",
    "however , later work on field dwarfs ( eder 1989 , schombert 1997 ) showed that there is very little difference between the cluster di class and the de vaucouleurs i m class .    with the addition of a wide variety of morphological types ,",
    "the definition of a dwarf galaxy has become blurred in the last decade .",
    "if asked , a theorist would define a dwarf galaxy by mass , then consider various formation scenarios that produce a mass spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , dark matter becomes fractionally more significant in galaxies with decreasing mass ( ashman 1992 ) , and this means that galaxy mass does not map , in a direct fashion , into observables such as luminosity , size or even rotational velocity .",
    "in addition , to make a difficult situation even worse , lower luminosity , density and size make the necessary observables laborious or impossible to obtain with our current technology and/or limited telescope time .    within the observables ,",
    "there are several methods in which to define a dwarf galaxy .",
    "for example , one can define a dwarf galaxy by optical luminosity ( tammann 1980 ) .",
    "since a galaxy s optical luminosity is the primarily due to the photons emitted by stellar photospheres , then the total luminosity should reflect the stellar mass . with a stable imf",
    ", the connection between luminosity and mass is parameterized by @xmath36 , the stellar mass , @xmath37 divided by the total luminosity of a galaxy , @xmath38 . therefore",
    ", a dwarf galaxy could be defined by some boundary in optical luminosity as it reflects into stellar mass . however , since the fraction of dark matter ( baryonic and non - baryonic ) increases with later type galaxies ( ashman 1992 ) , the use of luminosity to trace mass begins to decouple or has too many variables .",
    "dwarf galaxies are typically low in density , so division by central surface brightness ( based on fits to the galaxy s profile ) can be used as an indicator of dwarfness .",
    "there is some physical reasoning to support the idea that all lsb galaxies should be dwarf systems . to produce low stellar densities",
    "would require very low past star formation rates and , hence , low total stellar mass and luminosity .",
    "low surface brightness does not necessarily mean low stellar densities , but the colors of lsb galaxies rule out any highly unusual @xmath39 ( mcgaugh and de blok 1997 ) implying that low optical density is indeed low stellar density . or ,",
    "conversely , we might expect a dwarf galaxy of low mass to have low mean density which , in turn , inhibits star formation to produce a lsb object .",
    "one could argue that initial conditions , such as the amplitude of the density perturbation in the early universe from which the galaxy will form , produces a necessary connection between a dwarf galaxy and a lsb galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the discovery of large malin galaxies destroyed the notion that all lsb galaxies are dwarfs .",
    "in fact , most lsb disk systems are comparable in size to the ordinary spirals that make up the hubble sequence ( mcgaugh , schombert and bothun 1995 )",
    ".    low mass implies instability , at least with respect to the pattern of star formation .",
    "so , irregular structure is nominally associated with dwarf galaxies ( unless the star formation is completed , as in a dwarf elliptical ) .",
    "basically , late - type galaxies can be broken down into three morphological types ; those with bulges and lsb disks ( sc and sd class , those with apparent axial symmetry but no bulges ( sm class ) and those with no symmetry ( i m class ) .",
    "however , morphology is only weakly related to the mass of a galaxy .",
    "there are many irregular galaxies that are massive ( hunter and gallagher 1986 ) and many spirals which are dwarf - like in luminosity and size ( schombert 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , many high luminosity events , such as galaxy - galaxy interactions , are also associated with irregular morphology , although usually of a nature that identifies them as tidal in origin .",
    "irregular morphology , by itself , is not a sufficient criteria for dwarf classification .",
    "the most promising approach is to use the size of a galaxy as a measure of its dwarfness . a combination of angular size and irregular morphology were the criteria used in the initial construction of the pss - ii lsb dwarf catalog . our previous lsb surveys ( schombert and bothun 1988 ) was rich in lsb disks with scale lengths greater than 4 kpc , but few dwarf galaxies .",
    "that survey used a minimal angular size of one arcmin , the same as the ugc , to determine the bias against lsb galaxies in our catalogs .",
    "this pss - ii lsb dwarf survey set the criteria to be between 30 arcsecs and one arcmin , with a dramatically different metric size distribution as seen in figure 3 of schombert ( 1997 ) . with the acquisition of surface photometry and a hi redshift ,",
    "a proper comparison of scale length sizes for the sample can be made ( shown in the top panel of figure 3 ) .",
    "most of the objects ( 90% of the sample ) turn out to be quite small , less that the typical disk galaxy ( 3.2 kpc , de jong 1996 ) , testifying to the power of using morphology to select dwarf galaxies .",
    "we suspect that many of the undetected dwarf - like objects are probably background sc s outside the velocity range of the observing set - up for the arecibo telescope .",
    "we conclude from figure 3 that a robust method of collecting a sample of dwarf galaxies is to select objects by irregular morphology over a limited angular size ( in our case , 30 to 60 arcsecs ) .",
    "a sample of 458 candidates were found by visual inspection of the pss - ii plates .",
    "each candidate object was assigned a quality index as a measure of its probability to be a dwarf galaxy based on its morphological appearance .",
    "this is a purely subjective system , based on an objects irregular shape , lack of coherent spiral patterns , small to non - existent hii regions and a general lsb appearance .",
    "most of these galaxies would be classified as extreme late - type ( sm , i m , irr or di ) and a more complete discussion of their morphological and properties can be found in schombert , mcgaugh and eder ( 2000 ) . from our initial sample , 432 with high quality indices",
    "were observed on the arecibo 300 m telescope at 21-cm out to a velocity of 8,000 km sec@xmath10 .    of the 432 galaxies observed , 259 ( 60% ) were detected .",
    "the objects not detected are probably background lsb spirals ( with spiral patterns that were not visible on the plates ) , gas - poor dwarfs ( de s ) or dwarfs whose hi masses and distance fall below the sensitive limit of the telescope",
    ". a small sample of the nondetections were reobserved in a velocity range of 4,000 to 12,000 km sec@xmath10 in order to determine how many of the nondetected candidates were actually distant spiral galaxies . of 18 candidates ,",
    "10 were detected at the higher velocities .",
    "however , only 4 of these have velocity widths which suggest a normal spiral galaxy ( one being the malin object d559 - 3 with a velocity width of 576 km sec@xmath10 ) .",
    "the loss of gas - poor dwarfs from the sample is unfortunate since the distribution of de s , outside of a cluster environment , is not known .",
    "in fact , the existence of a true de , independent of a high local density or nearby companion , has not been confirmed ( binggeli , tarenghi and sandage 1990 ) .",
    "the spectra of all the detections from the three samples are presented in figure 1 .",
    "a hanning smoothing function has been applied , followed by a boxcar of 3 .",
    "each panel displays the raw data as well as the fitted baselines .",
    "a majority of the sample requires only a 2nd or 3rd order polynomial to flatten the baseline .",
    "as seen by other studies , most dwarfs have the classic double - horned profile indicative of rotation , although the data is too low in resolution to discern features such as asymmetries , filled - in cores or extended line wings ( hoffman 1996 , matthews , van driel and gallagher 1998 , staveley - smith , davies and kinman 1992 ) .",
    "skewed profiles may be due to confusion with nearby sources or pointing errors .",
    "the hi profiles can be divided into two types , gaussian and double - horned . a galaxy with a flat or",
    "rising rotation curve , and a distribution of gas that declines with radius in the form of a power law , will exhibit a hi profile that has two peaks with a flat plateau region between them ( see giovanelli and haynes 1988 ) . the 246 spectra in figure 1 were classified as either double horned , single horned or uncertain ( listed in table 1 ) .",
    "double horned profiles ( such as d475 - 4 or d704 - 2 ) have distinguishable peaks or a plateau shape .",
    "single horned profiles display a smooth gaussian shape with no indication of flattening . in many cases ( e.g. d709 - 5 ) ,",
    "the profile is broad , but the double horn shape is unclear due to noise . in other cases ( e.g. d702 - 1 ) , there is an asymmetry that distorts the profile .",
    "profiles with noisy plateaus are classed as uncertain .",
    "for the 246 spectra , 140 are double horned , 61 are single horned and 45 are uncertain . assuming the uncertain profiles are evenly divided between single and double ( most are broad and probably double horned ) , then double horned profiles are found in at least 70% of the sample .    the distribution of hi fluxes and hi profile widths are shown in figure 2 .",
    "all the detections are well above the 3@xmath28 level given the mean fluxes and velocity widths .",
    "the mean velocity width , even without inclination corrections , is low compared to a typical late - type galaxy sample ( see schombert , pildis and eder 1997 ) confirming our intent to acquire a sample of low mass objects .",
    "a handful of objects with @xmath40 km sec@xmath10 represent a few malin type objects , irregular in their morphology , that mimic a dwarf galaxy s appearance yet are actually large , distant spirals .    the metric scale length ( @xmath41 ) distribution , discussed in  4.1 ,",
    "is shown in the top panel of figure 3 . based on exponential fits to the @xmath15 band surface brightness profiles",
    ", @xmath41 provides the most fundamental property of a galaxy , its characteristic size . while the isophotal size of a galaxy , combined with its mean surface brightness , determines its visibility and detection probability .",
    "the typical scale length for a disk galaxy is indicated .",
    "the redshift distribution of the detected dwarfs is shown in the bottom panel of figure 3 .",
    "the spatial distribution was shown in figure 6 of schombert , pildis and eder ( 1997 ) . to repeat that paper s conclusion",
    ", lsb dwarfs trace the same large scale structure as brighter galaxies .",
    "figure 3 confirms that a majority of the dwarfs are located between 2000 and 6000 km sec@xmath10 , although there is a strong mass dependence .",
    "this dependence on mass is shown in the lower panel of the figure 3 as a plot of hi mass versus redshift .",
    "the solid line shows the telescope 3@xmath28 detection limit for a dwarf galaxy with a line width ( @xmath17 ) of 75 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "a majority of the detections lie above this line .",
    "objects below the limit all have line widths smaller than the assumed 75 km sec@xmath10 and , thus , a higher s / n per channel .",
    "note that the lowest mass object ( @xmath42 ) is located at less than 500 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "this plot demonstrates that the search for very low mass hi - rich galaxies is extremely difficult as a combination of confusion with galactic hi emission and small angular size makes their inclusion in any catalog problematic ( see schneider and schombert 1999 ) .",
    "it is also apparent from figure 3 that a search for objects with @xmath43 will require a smaller angular limit in order to catalog candidates and deeper hi observations to obtain sufficient s / n ( see also zwaan 1997 ) and that contrary to expectations ( briggs 1997 ) our galaxy catalogs are incomplete even in the local region of the universe .      the distribution of hi masses , calculated using the standard formula of distance and hi flux ( giovanelli and haynes 1988 ) is shown in the top panel of figure 4 .",
    "the sample has a mean value of @xmath44 and a sharp cutoff at @xmath45 .",
    "this can be compared to the ugc hi sample ( see figure 4 , schombert , pildis and eder 1997 ) where the mean hi mass of a ugc selected galaxy is @xmath46 .",
    "figure 4 shows that , whereas lsb galaxies are gas - rich , this does not mean that lsb dwarfs have high gas masses .",
    "the distribution of hi masses for this sample still defines the low - end of a gas mass distribution from any galaxy catalog and a galaxy selected to be dwarf - like by hi mass is as valid as classification by total mass or luminosity .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 4 displays mean hi surface density ( @xmath47 ) for each dwarf with available optical imaging .",
    "the hi radius has been used to determine the average surface density ( assuming the same axial ratio as the outer optical isophote ) .",
    "the @xmath47 values range from 0.6 to 20 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 with a mean value of 5 .",
    "the importance of @xmath47 to star formation was outlined in kennicutt ( 1989 ) where he found that star formation follows a power - law in ordinary galaxies ( the so - called schmidt law , sfr @xmath48 ) .",
    "key to kennicutt s findings was that there exists a threshold for star formation based on the toomre ( 1964 ) instability criterion , the balance between gravity and rotation / thermal pressures . in a study of five dwarf galaxies , van zee ( 1997 ) found that the critical threshold was between @xmath49 and @xmath50 atoms cm@xmath4 , which corresponds to the range of 5 and 30 @xmath3 pc@xmath4 in hi mass after corrections for neutral helium and other metals .",
    "this indicates that the mean hi surface densities for most of the lsb dwarfs in this sample are below the critical threshold density for star formation .",
    "of course , there can exist local density enhancements that could form sites of star formation .",
    "however , the average surface density for the galaxy is below the threshold and this would explain the lsb nature to the dwarf sample , where star formation has occurred in the past ( since there is some measurable stellar luminosity ) , but that this star formation has been inhibited and the current star formation levels are very low ( mcgaugh and de blok 1997 ) .",
    "the fraction of a galaxy s mass in the form of gas increases with later hubble types and can dominate the kinematics of a dwarf galaxy ( meurer 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the amount of gas in dwarf galaxies increases with decreasing surface brightness to the point where many of these dwarfs have gas fractions between 0.7 and 0.9 whereas the typical spiral have @xmath52 ( schombert , mcgaugh and eder 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the hubble sequence can be described as a declining ratio of stellar to gaseous material , where early - type galaxies are dominated by stars , later types by gas .",
    "this ratio is typically expressed as @xmath5 and is shown in figure 5 plotted against galaxy central surface brightness ( @xmath53 ) and galaxy color ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the lsb dwarfs have a much higher value of @xmath5 then the ordinary spirals , taken from the de jong ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath5 herein is similar to that of van zee , haynes and giovanelli ( 1995 ) , a study of extreme @xmath5 galaxies from the haynes and giovanelli hi survey with the @xmath5 values ranging from 0.3 to 12 and a mean value of 2.0 .",
    "this average @xmath5 found here is the same as the value found by van zee , haynes and giovanelli ( after adjustment for the @xmath15 band luminosities ) and we also find very few galaxies with @xmath55 even though this sample was selected by optical morphology rather than @xmath5 ratio .    by itself ,",
    "the hi properties of lsb dwarfs are poorly correlated with optical surface brightness or color .",
    "but , when compared with the de jong sample , it is clear that the dwarfs continue the trend of increasing @xmath5 with decreasing surface brightness and bluer colors .",
    "both these correlations provide insight into the star formation history of dwarf galaxies .",
    "higher @xmath5 s with lower central surface brightness reflects the obvious connection between a galaxy s gas supply and the density of its stellar population .",
    "lsb dwarf galaxies have converted very little of their gas into stars ( i.e. their past star formation has been inefficient and/or at a very low rate ) .",
    "thus , they maintain a high gas mass value in comparison to an even lower luminosity .",
    "the correlation with galaxy color follows from the surface brightness correlation .",
    "though star formation in lsb galaxies occurs at a low rate ( mcgaugh 1992 ) , even the smallest amount of star formation has a large impact on the total galaxy color due to the low surface brightness of the underlying population .",
    "galaxies with highest @xmath5 values have the bluest @xmath54 colors , meaning that the portion of the stellar population that contributes a majority of the optical luminosity in a lsb dwarf galaxy is quite young ( see also schombert , mcgaugh and eder 2000 ) .",
    "the dynamical mass values are listed in table 2 for the dwarf galaxies with optical imaging and the histograms of @xmath25 and @xmath56 values are found in the of figure 6 .",
    "note that this ratio is determined using @xmath15 band luminosities . for the typical dwarf color of @xmath57 ,",
    "the @xmath56 values are a factor of 4 higher than similar @xmath32 values ( staveley - smith , davies and kinman 1992 ) . in general , the dynamical masses are a factor of 10 higher than the hi masses , but still much lower than a typical spiral sample ( de jong 1996 ) . again , as we have seen with indirect mass indicators ( luminosity and size ) , galaxies selected by dwarf - like morphology define a low mass population .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , lsb dwarfs range in @xmath56 from 1.5 to 50 with a mean of 20 . for comparison , the mean @xmath58 of spiral galaxy pairs",
    "is 40 at radii of 100 kpc ( honma 1999 ) .",
    "a comparison of dynamical mass to stellar mass ( as represented by the total @xmath15 band magnitude of the dwarf ) is found in figure 7 .",
    "magnitudes in the @xmath15 band are preferred over other bandpasses because stellar population models ( worthey 1994 ) show that the stellar mass to luminosity ratio ( @xmath59 ) vary with time and star formation rate as a function of wavelength , but is most stable in the far - red .",
    "the use of the @xmath15 band observations minimizes these stellar populations effects due to its distance in wavelength from the region around the 4000  break .",
    "thus , @xmath15 band measurements 1 ) provide a more accurate estimate of the stellar mass of a galaxy , 2 ) obtain a luminosity measure that vary little with recent star formation and 3 ) determine structural parameters ( such as scale length ) which are undistorted by recent star formation events .",
    "although there is a great deal of scatter in the @xmath60 versus @xmath25 diagram , the lsb dwarf sample defines a linear correlation with a constant @xmath58 slope .",
    "immediately obvious is that none of the dwarfs have their total masses composed solely of stars . nor is the total mass explained by the sum of the stellar and gas masses ( see below ) . in other words ,",
    "lsb dwarfs are dark matter dominated .",
    "interestingly , the linear correlation means that the dark matter follows the stellar light , even for this sample of extreme @xmath58 objects .",
    "one could interpret this one - to - one correspondence to indicate that dark matter is baryonic ( i.e. baryons follow baryons ) .",
    "however , it is equally probable that the dark matter component is non - baryonic and simply accretes baryon material in a fashion that is proportional to its own mass .",
    "certainly , with the discovery of massive neutrinos ( see turner 1997 ) , it is now known that at least some fraction of the dark matter component in galaxies is non - baryonic .",
    "the remaining question , regarding the dynamical mass estimates , is how much of a dwarf galaxies mass is in the form of observable baryonic material .",
    "this question is answered , graphically , in figure 8 where we plot the ratios of stellar mass to dynamical mass and gas mass to dynamical mass .",
    "the stellar mass is calculated assuming a @xmath59 of 1.2 , based on the optical colors of lsb galaxies ( mcgaugh and de blok 1997 ) .",
    "again , the advantage of @xmath15 band magnitudes is that this value is very insensitive to recent star formation , varying only 10% for the range of observed optical colors in lsb dwarfs .",
    "the gas mass is calculated from the hi mass and multiplying for a factor of 1.4 to account for helium and metals .",
    "there has been no observed co emission in lsb galaxies ( schombert 1990 ) and the current star formation signature by h@xmath41 emission is weak .",
    "thus , we take the amount of molecular and ionized gas to be negligible .",
    "although there has been discussion of ionization by extragalactic uv ( corbelli and salpeter 1993 ) , none has been detected in lsb galaxies .",
    "the sum of the stellar and gas masses produces the mass in baryons ( @xmath61 ) for each galaxy shown in figure 8 .",
    "unlike the rest of the hubble sequence , lsb dwarfs tend to have equal amounts of mass in the form of stars and gas .",
    "however , both these components are a small fraction of the total mass .",
    "the mean for @xmath62 is 0.11 and the mean for @xmath63 is 0.08 .",
    "this is similar to the value found by burlak ( 1996 ) of @xmath64 . combining the gas and stellar mass numbers , we find that the mass in baryons for these dwarf galaxies is less than 20% the total mass , on average . again , in agreement with a value of 26% from burlak .",
    "the paper is the third in a series concerning the properties of newly discovered lsb dwarfs .",
    "these galaxies were selected by irregular morphology from deep photographic plates ( pss - ii ) . while the emphasis was on their visual appearance , this method to find new , uncataloged galaxies",
    "is automatically biased the search to objects with very low central surface brightnesses ( i.e. not visible on previous sky surveys ) .",
    "the combination of low surface brightness and dwarf - like morphology was highly effective at producing a sample of low mass , low luminosity and small metric size galaxies .",
    "the results from the hi data presented herein can be summarized as the following :    * low mass dwarfs exists , but are rare .",
    "contrary to claims ( briggs 1997 ) , our current galaxy catalogs are incomplete for objects with hi masses less than @xmath65 since these objects are small and low in surface brightness and would be confused with galactic emission in hi surveys . *",
    "the hi mass distribution has a mean of @xmath44 with a sharp cutoff above @xmath45 and a long tail to low hi masses .",
    "this distribution is much lower than a typical spiral sample and demonstrates that , although lsb galaxies are hi - rich , the gas component does not make them high mass .",
    "mean hi surface densities are below the critical density for star formation based on the toomre criteria , justifying statements that lsb dwarfs are inefficient at star formation and have quiescent past histories in agreement with their lsb nature .",
    "* lsb dwarfs continue the trend from late - type spirals of high @xmath5 , increasing with lower central surface brightnesses and bluer colors .",
    "the explanation of this correlation lies in a quiescent star formation history which leaves a large gas reservoir on top of a faint stellar population .",
    "any recent star formation , even at a very low rate , has a sharp blueward effect on the underlying lsb structure . *",
    "the @xmath60,@xmath25 correlation ( figure 7 ) demonstrates that the lsb dwarf sample that the dark matter ( whether baryonic or non - baryonic ) follows the baryonic matter .",
    "the distribution of @xmath56 ranges from 1.5 to 50 ( note that these are @xmath15 band numbers , a factor of 4 higher than equivalent values in the @xmath32 band ) .    the authors wish to thank the generous support of the arecibo observatory for the allocation of time to search for hi emission from the candidate dwarf galaxies and michigan- dartmouth - m.i.t observatory in carrying out the photometry portion of this program this work is based on photographic plates obtained at the palomar observatory 48-inch oschin telescope for the second palomar observatory sky survey which was funded by the eastman kodak company , the national geographic society , the samuel oschin foundation , the alfred sloan foundation , the national science foundation and the national aeronautics and space administration .",
