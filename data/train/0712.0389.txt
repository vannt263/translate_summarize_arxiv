    "studies of stars in the central galactic region are essential for an understanding of the milky way .",
    "for example , the questions of the structure and extent of the galactic bar , the star formation history , and the distance to the center of our galaxy can all be answered by analyzing various stellar tracers .",
    "knowledge of the galactic extinction is mandatory to begin investigations of these stars in a quantitative fashion .",
    "a good understanding of extinction is particularly important for the direction toward the galactic bulge and within the galactic plane , where extinction is very significant .",
    "extinction @xmath3 changes as a function of wavelength @xmath4 .",
    "the shape of the extinction curve is characterized by the quantity @xmath5 , the ratio of total to selective extinction ; @xcite have shown that the family of curves characterized by this single parameter provides a good fitting approximation to most extinction curves . thus ,",
    "if the value of @xmath5 can be determined ( e.g. , from optical and ir photometry ) , then one can approximately find the properties of the entire uv - ir extinction curve .",
    "there are a few suggestions that the coefficient of selective extinction in the direction of the galactic bulge may be non - standard ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "anomalous extinction , i.e. , extinction described by smaller @xmath6 or @xmath7 ratio than the standard value of @xmath6 = 3.1 , can significantly affect analysis of the stellar populations in the galactic bulge . here , @xmath6 is the coefficient of selective extinction @xmath8 , with reference to the @xmath9 and @xmath0 filters , and @xmath10 , alluding to the @xmath0 and @xmath11 filters . especially with the onset of a new generation of large telescopes ,",
    "this problem becomes increasingly pressing and important , and one that can be addressed with this study . here ,",
    "optical @xmath0 and @xmath11-band data for 3256 rr0 lyrae stars from the macho microlensing experiment are used to find both the coefficient of selective extinction and to compute the absolute reddening near the galactic bulge / bar .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is known to vary in certain directions , and reddening laws are normally derived from differential measurements of reddened and unreddened luminous early - type stars . however , as such stars are rare in the galactic bulge , the normal derivation of @xmath6 can not be carried out .",
    "the @xmath6 values determined from the rr lyrae stars are compared with other reddening relations .",
    "the data used in this analysis are based on the macho photometry of 3674 rr0 lyrae stars toward the galactic bulge .",

    "( 2007 , in preparation ) divide the macho bulge rr0 lyrae variables into those associated with the galactic bulge ( 3256 stars ) , and the ones associated with the neighboring sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( 409 stars ) .",
    "their classification is assumed in this work .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "the method and resultant coefficient of selective extinction toward the bulge is discussed and compared to other estimates in  2 .",
    "reddenings of the bulge rr0 lyrae stars are determined in  3 using their minimum v - band light colors these reddenings are then compared to @xcite reddening estimates and the outliers are discussed .",
    "as the bulge rr lyrae stars span a much larger range in color than sgr ones , a coefficient of selective extinction is determined using only this subsample . assuming that the extinction affects the @xmath0 magnitudes much more significantly than the distance spread , the intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitudes , and the scatter due to various observational errors , the slope of the stellar locus on a @xmath12 ( mean v magnitudes of the rr lyrae stars ) versus @xmath13 ( mean color of the rr lyrae stars ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) yields @xmath14 @xcite . in other words , if in the distance modulus , @xmath15 we assume @xmath16 and @xmath17 is approximately constant , then the apparent magnitude , @xmath12 , is proportional to @xmath18 : @xmath19 taking the @xmath20 of each rr0 lyrae star to be approximately constant , @xmath21 which is in the form of a general linear equation with @xmath12 as the independent variable , @xmath13 as the dependent variable , and @xmath7 as the slope .",
    "it is shown in the following section that the above conditions are approximately met .",
    "figure  [ plotone ] is a plot of mean @xmath12 , versus mean @xmath13 .",
    "artificial star tests from @xcite indicate that the limiting magnitude of the photometry in the @xmath0 and @xmath11 band is about 21.5 , which is 0.5 magnitudes fainter than the faintest rr lyrae star in this macho bulge sample .",
    "the monte carlo analysis discussed later in this section indicates the limiting magnitude has little effect on this paper s analysis .",
    "the sources contributing to the intrinsic dispersions of the average @xmath0 and @xmath11 apparent magnitudes are now discussed and quantified following the approach from @xcite .",
    "photometric errors .",
    "since many macho fields partly overlap on the sky , some stars may be counted in the database twice .",
    "using 184 double - represented stars , the internal photometric uncertainty in @xmath22 , @xmath0 , and @xmath11 was found by comparing colors and magnitudes evaluated in different fields .",
    "for the macho data toward the galactic bulge , the individual error in @xmath12 is @xmath23 0.15 mag and the individual error in @xmath13 is 0.04 ( cook et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "as the error in @xmath12 and @xmath13 are correlated , upon multiplying the error in @xmath13 , ( 0.04 mags ) , by the slope of the fit , ( 4.28 ) , this value is added to the error in @xmath12 .",
    "the photometric error in the points in figure  [ plotone ] is thus 0.32 mags .",
    "absolute magnitude of rr lyrae stars .",
    "it is generally assumed that the absolute magnitude of an rr lyrae star has a linear dependence on @xmath24 $ ] , and that @xmath25 / @xmath26   = $ ] 0.2 mag @xmath27 .",
    "the dispersion around the mean value of @xmath28 $ ] = -1.00 dex found in galactic bulge rr lyrae stars is @xmath29 mag .",
    "( kunder et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute magnitude dispersion of about 0.06 mag .",
    "the level of evolution off the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) can also affect at rr lyrae star s absolute magnitude .",
    "from the vertical height of the hb of a number of globular clusters of different metallicities , the dispersion around the average rr lyrae luminosity due to the evolution off the zahb of each individual rr lyrae is estimated as @xmath30 0.08 mag @xcite .",
    "the scatter in rr lyrae absolute magnitude due to evolutionary phase , helium content , and alpha - element abundance [ @xmath31/fe ] , are less significant and are not accounted for .",
    "\\3 . bulge distance spread .    using the standard hernquist model density profile with a scale length , characteristic density , and characteristic velocity of the bulge from @xcite table  2 ,",
    "the size of the bulge is @xmath30 1 kpc . as the galactic latitude and longitude of the macho bulge fields ranges from -1.5@xmath32 to - 10@xmath32 and 0@xmath32 to 10@xmath32 , respectively",
    ", a correction between the line of sight of the rr lyrae stars in the bulge fields and the plane of the galaxy is negligible .",
    "a distance spread of 1 kpc corresponds to a @xmath33 of @xmath30 0.29 mags .    adding in quadrature all dispersion contributions , the scatter in @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath22 is 0.44 mags , with the major source of this scatter resulting from the extent of the bulge along the line of sight .    fitting a straight line to the data",
    "must be done with caution , since errors are present in both independent and dependent variables and are furthermore correlated with each other .",
    "ordinary least squares ( ols ) , which assumes no error in the independent variable , can therefore not be used here . instead a straight line fit to the data is obtained using an ols bisector fit to the individual data points .",
    "the ols - bisector method has been used when both variables are subject to measurement error and it is not clear which variable should be treated as the independent and which as the dependent .",
    "it has been shown to outperform other approaches in such cases @xcite . using the slopes program @xcite",
    ", the data are fit using the ols - bisector method .",
    "the slope found is @xmath34 and is shown as a solid line in figure  [ plotone ] . upon restricting the fit to those stars with @xmath35 , a slope of @xmath36 is obtained . a further cut to remove the very red stars with @xmath37 , yields a slope of @xmath38 .",
    "these fit values are given in table  [ tab : rvtab ] ; the @xmath7 chosen as the optimal regression is @xmath39 4.28 , as it accounts for all data values .",
    "table  [ tab : rvtab ] shows that the slope is quite sensitive to just a few points , although these formal errors for the ols - bisector method are quite small . the error in @xmath7 of @xmath40",
    "is chosen to encompass the range of slopes .",
    "the ols - bisector fit to our data is further investigated with a simple monte carlo analysis . to duplicate the observed rr0 lyrae data in this paper , 3500 @xmath41 values between 0 and 1.5",
    "are randomly selected .",
    "@xmath41 is converted to av using a selective extinction coefficient , @xmath7 , which we vary .",
    "assuming an rr lyrae absolute magnitude of @xmath16 = 0.6 and a distance to the bulge of 8 kpc , an observed @xmath0 magnitude is found . as the observed @xmath0 magnitudes in the macho data have an error of @xmath30 0.5 mags , gaussian random numbers are generated with a dispersion of 0.5 mags , and added to the simulated @xmath0 magnitudes . using @xmath42 , and assuming the uncertainty in the measured @xmath22 colors is 0.05 magnitudes , the simulated v magnitudes can be plotted as a function of simulated ( v - r ) magnitudes .",
    "we make sure this simulated plot looks similar to figure  [ plotone ] .",
    "next a cut is made to remove all stars which have v and r magnitudes less than 21.5 .",
    "the ols - bisector method is then used to derive the slope of the fit before and after the magnitude cut .",
    "we find there is no significant change in the value of the slope after the cut .",
    "however , the slope found using the ols - bisector method is not always the value of the slope that was input .",
    "this has implications on the derived @xmath7 value .",
    "apparently the errors in the photometry in this paper are sufficient to throw off the ols - bisector fit for a given value .",
    "figure  [ plottwo ] shows the difference in the true @xmath7 value and the ols - bisector slope , @xmath43-ols slope , as a function of the true @xmath7 value .",
    "the scatter in this plot is mainly due to the errors in the @xmath0-magnitudes and @xmath22 colors .",
    "a slope with a value of @xmath30 4.6 exhibits the least amount of deviation between the true and calculated @xmath7 value .",
    "the @xmath7 value found in this paper is close to 4.6 , so the slope found by the ols - bisector method should not be significantly biased .",
    "even values well above and below 4.6 do not differ from the true @xmath7 value by more than 0.2 mags .",
    "other simulations with somewhat different input parameters ( e.g. , uncertainty in photometry ) are performed and results similar , but not identical to figure  [ plottwo ] , are found .",
    "thus , we can not simply correct the slope that is obtained from the real data using these simulations .",
    "thus , an uncertainty of 0.2 in the @xmath7 is adopted .",
    "it is an interesting question how this @xmath7 value from the macho rr lyrae stars compares with other reddening relations .",
    "reddening relations determined from broad band photometric data depend on the intrinsic spectral energy distributions of the objects used to determine them as well as the particular filters .",
    "the macho @xmath44 and @xmath45 filters are considerably different from johnson @xmath0 and kron - cousins @xmath11 .    to compare our results to the standard extinction curve , the @xcite extinction curve with a constant total - to - selective extinction parameter , @xmath46 , is used with the phoenix model synthetic spectra @xcite .",
    "the johnson bvr transmission curves from @xcite yield @xmath47 for @xmath48 k , @xmath49 for @xmath50 k and @xmath51 for @xmath52 k. an effective temperature of 6000 k - 7000 k is typical of rr lyrae stars , and an effective temperature of 30000 k is typical of early type stars . the synthetic spectra adopted is one with @xmath28 = -1.0 $ ] and @xmath53 , but varying @xmath28 $ ] and surface gravity does not significantly affect the @xmath7 values .",
    "the macho @xmath44 and @xmath45 filters are non - standard , but were transformed into the johnson @xmath0 and kron - cousins @xmath11 as described in @xcite .",
    "we simulated this procedure by using the macho @xmath44 and @xmath45 transmission curves and our synthetic spectra to obtain macho @xmath44 and @xmath45 magnitudes .",
    "these were then converted using the @xcite transformation .",
    "it is found that @xmath54 for @xmath48 k , and @xmath55 for @xmath50 k. both these values are in agreement with the value obtained in this analysis . in comparison ,",
    "a @xmath6 = 2.5 would yield @xmath56 .",
    "reddening laws are normally derived from differential measurement of reddened and unreddened luminous early - type stars .",
    "but such stars are absent in the galactic bulge .",
    "this analysis uses population ii type stars and indicates that the reddening law in the bulge is on average similar to the standard solar neighborhood value of @xmath46 .",
    "changing @xmath6 to e.g. a non - standard value , does significantly affect the measured @xmath7 .",
    "quantitatively , it is found that the change in @xmath7 is 68% of the change in @xmath6 .    using galactic bulge red clump giants from the ogle dataset , @xcite present substantial evidence that the ratio of total to selective absorption , @xmath57 , is much smaller toward the galactic bulge than the value corresponding to the standard extinction curve and that @xmath6 varies considerably along different lines of sight .",
    "their value of @xmath58 , as opposed to the standard value of about 2.5 , corresponds to an @xmath6 of about 2.6 .",
    "@xcite constructed extinction and reddening maps for baade s window from color - magnitude diagrams obtained by ogle which showed that extinction in baade s window is quite irregular , varying between 1.3 and 2.8 mag in @xmath59 , with an estimated error of @xmath30 0.1 mag .",
    "@xcite use 70 galactic planetary nebulae observed using narrow - band filters to find observed @xmath60 = 2.0 toward the bulge .",
    "the @xmath7 value determined from the rr lyrae stars above , indicates that the standard galactic reddening law can in general be adopted in studies of objects toward the bulge .",
    "we caution that the value of @xmath6 can vary in certain directions but that on average , the standard reddening law can be used .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that apparent @xmath61 colors of rr lyrae stars at phases close to the minimum light can be utilized to measure the amount of interstellar reddening along the line of sight to the star since the intrinsic @xmath62 colors seem constant in the phase interval 0.5  0.8 .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath63 colors might also be used , perhaps with a smaller or negligible metallicity correction .",
    "we investigate this further for @xmath22 colors below .    the colors at minimum light , @xmath20 ,",
    "can be computed via two different methods . in the first method",
    ", the fourier fits to both @xmath0 and @xmath11-band data are used to average the colors , in magnitude units , for phases between 0.5 and 0.8 .",
    "however , we find that when @xmath20 is determined using this method , it correlated with amplitude . in the second method ,",
    "the @xmath22 color is found at minimum @xmath0-band light .",
    "@xcite used this technique and found that intrinsic color at minimum @xmath0-band light is nearly independent of period and @xmath0-band variation amplitude . since this method yields @xmath20 values that are very weakly correlated with amplitude , this is the method employed here .",
    "table  [ tab : chabtab ] presents our determination of unreddened @xmath20 colors for eleven well observed field rr0 variables ( the data in table  [ tab : chabtab ] come from liu & janes 1989 ; cacciari et al .",
    "1987 ; and layden 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "the color excess , @xmath41 , is computed by multiplying the published @xmath64 values by the ratio of @xmath65 , where the values @xmath66 and @xmath67 are taken from @xcite . value . ] a plot of @xmath41 vs @xmath22 has a linear character .",
    "this is quite remarkable , considering some of these stars exhibit the blazhko effect ( e.g. , aw and ) , some are affected by both the blazhko effect and a `` phase - lag '' problem ( e.g. , ss for ) , and some have evidence of shock waves in their atmospheres ( e.g. , rv phe , v440 sgr ) as discussed by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in many rr lyrae stars the blazhko effect does not affect colors at minimum light , making this method robust .",
    "we conclude that the mean @xmath20 color of rr0 lyrae stars at minimum @xmath0-band light is @xmath68 .",
    "table  [ tab : chabtab ] suggests that the intrinsic color at minimum light is independent or at least very insensitive to metallicity .",
    "the _ observed _ and _ intrinsic _ colors at minimum @xmath0-band are put forth to determine the color excess of the bulge rr0 lyrae stars : @xmath69    the fourier fits performed to find @xmath22 color at minimum @xmath0-band light are sensitive to the quality of a lightcurve . to insure high @xmath41 accuracy without sacrificing the sample size , the fourier fits in both passbands for all stars",
    "are individually examined .",
    "only those with fits that approximated the rr lyrae light curve nicely are taken ( i.e. , if the fourier method mimicked features in the rr lyrae lightcurve well , such as the dip and sharp rise of the curve at minimum light ) .",
    "this criterion results in 3525 rr0 lyrae stars with well determined reddening values .",
    "example entries of this reddening catalog are presented in table 3 ; the complete listing is available in the electronic version .",
    "multiplying the 3525 @xmath70 values by the selective extinction coefficient , @xmath7 , allows the determination of the visual extinction .",
    "a map of the visual extinction , @xmath18 , is shown in figure  [ plotthree ] . as @xcite also remark , it is immediately obvious that on large scales , extinction is regularly stratified parallel to the galactic plane .    to determine the distance modulus to the galactic bulge from the rr0",
    "lyrae stars , an rr lyrae absolute magnitude of @xmath71 at @xmath28=-1.5 $ ] as compiled by @xcite is adopted .",
    "if a metallicity dependence of @xmath72 + constant$ ] is adopted ( consistent with the range of slopes found in the literature ) , then using the average metallicity of @xmath28=-1 $ ] from above , an @xmath73 for rr lyrae stars in the bulge is obtained .",
    "this predicts @xmath74 for bulge rr lyrae . adopting the rr lyrae statistical parallax calibration of @xmath75 at @xmath28=-1.6 $ ] from @xcite , then using the same metallicity dependence ,",
    "an @xmath76 for rr lyrae stars in the galactic bulge is predicted .",
    "this is identical to the galactocentric distance modulus measured by @xcite from the orbit of a star around the central black hole .      in this subsection",
    "the reddenings obtained here are tested against @xcite values , which are based on photometry from the macho bulge fields .",
    "the macho data of the galactic bulge are based on observations of 94 bulge fields , each field covering an area of 43 by 43. @xcite use 4 x 4 sky regions ( tiles ) as resolution elements .",
    "they show that mean colors for these tiles can be converted to extinction , and can thus be used to derive a visual extinction map .",
    "each rr0 lyrae star is matched with the corresponding tile , and the color excess , @xmath77 , of the line of sight to the rr0 lyrae star is compared to the @xcite , @xmath78 , as calibrated to @xcite extinction , as calibrated to @xcite extinction is about @xmath79 redder than @xmath78 calibrated to @xcite . ] .",
    "figure  [ plotfour ] shows this linear relationship , with the line of slope unity over - plotted .",
    "the @xmath77 values become larger than @xmath78 when reddening increases , which could mean the @xcite extinction map underestimates the extinction in areas with high reddening . performing the @xcite calibration to the macho rr lyrae lightcurve data does not alter this result . an increase in scatter",
    "is expected in stars with high reddenings , since generally a redder rr0 lyrae star is fainter and is more likely to have noisy photometry and lightcurves .",
    "especially near the galactic center , differential reddening due to nonuniform distribution of the intervening dust on small spatial scales makes the study of the stellar population difficult even in the infrared ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite show in their figure  5 , that the amount of differential reddening in a field is directly proportional to the average reddening : the more reddening present in a field , the more patchy that reddening is .",
    "as the @xcite extinction map is based on the average color of 4 x 4 sky regions , their average colors and hence reddenings would be susceptible to differential reddening , explaining the slight discrepancy between their reddenings and ours at higher reddenings .    what could cause the systematic bias in the @xmath77 values to become larger than the @xmath78 as the reddening increases ? @xcite perform a calibration to @xcite extinction and this calibration assumes a uniform @xmath6 value .",
    "this assumption does not hold , however , since the extinction toward the bulge has nonstandard properties ( popowski 2000 ) .",
    "@xcite find that the difference between the measured line of sight @xmath57 , and the standard value of @xmath57 depends on color .",
    "furthermore , they find that this difference is larger for redder @xmath80 colors and practically negligible in the range where the ogle data were calibrated by standards @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , the difference in the coefficient of selective extinction @xmath7 and the standard @xmath7 would also increase with increasing @xmath82 and hence with increasing @xmath83 ( since @xcite uses the average color to determine @xmath83 ) . as the @xcite @xmath83 calibration neglects a change in @xmath7 with increasing color , at higher @xmath83 the values will be underestimated .",
    "the most obvious outlier in figure  [ plotfour ] is the rr0 lyrae star that is designated in the macho database as 175.30921.95 .",
    "it has a negative @xmath70 , which is unphysical .",
    "it has a period , amplitude and light curve shape that confirm it is a fundamental mode pulsator .",
    "however , as is clear from its position on a color - magnitude diagram , with @xmath84 it is one of the bluest stars in the dataset ( see figure  [ plotone ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that as many as 3% of the rr0 lyrae stars may have an unusual blueness associated with them .",
    "the only stars with a color bluer than this star and with an r - band lightcurve suitable for reddening determination , are stars 125.23192.175 and 117.26079.4609 , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the bluer of these two stars @xmath70 deviates by 0.3 mag from @xmath83 , while the other one by only 0.06 mag .",
    "other very blue stars include 129.26623.1139 with @xmath87 and 146.28412.88 with @xmath88 , but their @xmath70 is in agreement with @xmath83 .",
    "one more characteristic that distinguishes the blue outlying stars 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 from their blue non - outlying counterparts , is the fact that these stars have periods that lie in the range 0.469 - 0.472 days , a range in which unstable light curves are common @xcite .",
    "spectra of unusually blue stars in the period interval of 0.469 - 0.472 days , ar her and bb vir , were taken by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was found that these stars have systematically stronger hydrogen lines at minimum light than all the other stars , indicating a higher temperature .",
    "the cause of the higher temperature , however , remains unknown .",
    "@xcite suggested that bb vir could be a rr0 lyrae star that for some reason has evolved a long way beyond the fundamental blue edge without yet changing mode .",
    "the `` hysteresis '' effect is well - known in globular clusters and it is possible that stars 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 are also extreme examples of it .",
    "stars at the blue edge of the instability strip should have a larger amplitude @xcite .",
    "stars 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 , the blue stars with deviating @xmath41 values , have about twice as large @xmath0 amplitudes as the other two blue stars , 129.26623.1139 and 146.28412.88 .",
    "it is also possible that the macho photometry of the star 175.30921.95 and 125.23192.175 is incorrect .",
    "follow - up observations would help clarify this point . in conclusion , although rare , reddening values for rr0 lyrae stars determined by finding the @xmath22 color at minimum @xmath0-band light can be in error if the star is unusually blue .",
    "this can be corrected if the temperature of the rr0 lyrae star is known .",
    "a quantitative analysis of reddening toward the galactic bulge is performed . assuming that the extinction affects the @xmath0 magnitudes more significantly than the distance spread and the intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitudes , we interpret the slope of the stellar locus on the @xmath0 versus @xmath22 diagram as the selective extinction coefficient , @xmath89 . from the macho rr0 lyrae sample toward the galactic bulge , we derive @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to the average value observed in the solar neighborhood @xmath2 , and indicates that the optical reddening law toward the bulge is consistent with the standard extinction law .",
    "we show that the mean minimum - light @xmath20 color of an rr0 lyrae star is nearly constant at minimum @xmath0-band light and equals @xmath68 , regardless of metallicity . using this property , reddening values to 3525 rr0 lyrae stars",
