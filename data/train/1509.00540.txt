    "the recent advance of networking technologies makes control systems more flexible .",
    "however , the use of networks also raises new challenges such as packet dropouts , variable transmission delays , and real - time task scheduling . switched system models",
    "provide a mathematical framework for such network properties because of their versatility to include both continuous flows and discrete jumps ; see @xcite and references therein for the application of switched system models to networked control systems .    on the other hand , many control loops in a practical network contain channels over which only a finite number of bits can be transmitted .",
    "we need to quantize data before sending them out through a network .",
    "therefore the effect of data quantization should be taken into consideration to achieve stability and desired performance .",
    "in addition to the practical motivation , literature such as has answered the theoretical question of how much information is necessary / sufficient for a given control problem .    switched systems and quantized control have been studied extensively but separately ; see , e.g. , @xcite for switched systems and @xcite for quantized control . however , quantized control of switched systems has received increasing attention in recent years . for discrete - time markovian jump linear systems , control problems with limited information have been studied in @xcite .",
    "also , our previous work @xcite has investigated the output feedback stabilization of continuous - time switched systems under a slow - switching assumption . in most of the above studies , the switching behavior of the plant is available to the controller _ at all times . _    in contrast , in _ sampled - data _ switched systems with quantization , the controller receives the quantized measurement and the active mode of the plant _ only at each sampling time_. since the controller side does not know the active mode of the plant between sampling times , we do not always use the controller mode consistent with the plant mode at the present time .",
    "the closed - loop system may therefore become unstable when switching occurs between sampling times .",
    "moreover , for the stability of quantized systems , it is important to obtain regions to which the state belongs .",
    "however , mode mismatches yield complicated state trajectories , which make it difficult to find such regions .    stabilization of sampled - data switched system with _ dynamic _",
    "quantizers has been first addressed in @xcite , which has proposed an encoding strategy for state feedback control .",
    "this encoding method has been extended to the output feedback case @xcite and to the case with disturbances @xcite .",
    "a crucial ingredient in the dynamic quantization is a reachable set of the state trajectories through sampling intervals .",
    "propagation of reachable sets is used to set the quantization values at the next sampling time , and the dynamic quantizer achieves increasingly higher precision as the state approaches the origin . on the other hand ,",
    "we study the stability analysis of sampled - data switched systems with _",
    "finite - level static _ quantizers .",
    "for such a closed - loop system , asymptotic stability can not be guaranteed .",
    "the objective of the present paper is therefore to find an ultimate bound on the system trajectories as in the single - modal case , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since frequent mode mismatches make the trajectories diverge , a certain switching condition is required for the existence of ultimate bounds .    as in @xcite for switched systems with time delays , we here characterize switching behaviors by the total time when the controller mode is not synchronized with the plant one , which we call the _ total mismatch time_. we derive a sufficient condition on the total mismatch time for the system to be stable , by using an upper bound on the error due to sampling and quantization .",
    "moreover , an ultimate bound on the state trajectories is obtained under the switching condition . for the stability analysis ,",
    "we use a common lyapunov function that guarantees stability for all individual modes in the non - switched case .",
    "we find such lyapunov functions in a computationally efficient and less conservative way by combining the randomized algorithms in @xcite together .    from the total mismatch time",
    ", we can obtain an asynchronous switching time ratio .",
    "if the controller mode is synchronized with the plant one , then the closed - loop system is stable .",
    "otherwise , the system may be unstable .",
    "hence the total mismatch time is a characterization similar to the total activation time ratio @xcite between stable modes and unstable ones .",
    "the crucial difference is that the unstable modes we consider are caused by switching within sampling intervals . using the dependence of the instability on the sampling period",
    ", we can reduce the switching condition on the total mismatch time to a dwell - time condition , which is widely used for the stability analysis of switched systems . in section  4",
    ", we will discuss in detail the relationship between the total mismatch time and the dwell time of switching behaviors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we present the closed - loop system , the information structure , and basic assumptions . in section  3",
    ", we first investigate the growth rate of the common lyapunov function in the case when switching occurs in a sampling interval .",
    "next we derive an ultimate bound on the state , together with a sufficient condition on switching for stability .",
    "section  4 is devoted to reduce the derived switching condition to a dwell - time condition .",
    "we illustrate the results through a numerical example in section  5 . finally , concluding remarks are given in section  6 .",
