    "the uniprot knowledgebase ( uniprotkb )  @xcite consists of two parts : , containing manually annotated records describing proteins with information extracted from the scientific literature and curator - evaluated computational analysis , and , with automatically annotated records .",
    "the uniprotkb is available in several data formats , including rdf @xcite , at www.uniprot.org .",
    "the rdf distribution currently consists of almost 2.3 billion triples , making it one of the largest data sets that is available in rdf .",
    "roughly 10% of these triples are metadata that provide provenance and evidence information and this percentage is expected to increase .",
    "in general , scientists tend to have higher confidence in information that has been reviewed and approved by other scientists than in unreviewed data that was predicted by programs . in uniprotkb this is reflected by a split into two main sections : the manually curated and reviewed and the automatically annotated and unreviewed .",
    "but even manually reviewed data comes with different degrees of reliability .",
    "historically , only four basic types of evidences were distinguished :    experimental : :    the annotation is supported by experimental evidence . probable : :    the annotation was inferred with good confidence by a curator from    another annotation with experimental evidence ( e.g. an experimentally    proven transcription factor is inferred to be located in the cell    nucleus ) . by similarity : :    the annotation was inferred based on a high sequence similarity to a    protein which has experimental evidence for the same annotation .",
    "potential : :    the annotation was predicted by a sequence analysis tool .",
    "this course - grained approach no longer meets the demands of bioinformaticians who ask for more detailed evidence information and , over all , provenance information .",
    "uniprot hence extended the metadata it records to include the following :    source : :    indicates the source of the information .",
    "there are three main    categories :    +    scientific literature ; ;      uniprotkb / swiss - prot records summarize the published knowledge about      a protein in a condensed way .",
    "scientists interested in more detailed      information can retrieve and read the original publications .",
    "programs ; ;      some uniprotkb annotations are inferred from the results of various      sequence analysis programs . distinguishing these annotations from      those with an experimental origin is important for users using      uniprotkb as a training set for prediction programs .    external databases ; ;      uniprotkb also imports data from other databases .",
    "scientists      interested in more detailed information can retrieve and read the      external database records .",
    "can also be used internally to      synchronize information .",
    "date : :    indicates when a statement has last been updated .",
    "can also be used    internally to select aging records for which annotation might need to    be revised .",
    "uniprot has also extended its evidence codes slightly , and is currently investigating the adoption of the go evidence codes  @xcite , which are widely used in the biocuration field , to provide even more detailed and standardized evidence information .",
    "we will use the semi - automatic annotation program hamap @xcite to illustrate how provenance information is currently described in the uniprotkb .",
    "this program uses manually curated protein family rules to annotate all proteins that belong to the same family . in the examples shown ,",
    "it has annotated the recommended protein name based on the family rule mf_00536 . in the rdf representation",
    ", we use reification to attach the provenance information to the name of the protein ( see example [ rdf : provenance ] in turtle syntax with prefixes omitted for readability ) . using sparql , one can retrieve all proteins whose names were annotated by this hamap rule ( see example [ sparql : current ] ) .    ....",

    "evidence and provenance information is stored in `` evidence '' elements .",
    "the data to which the evidence applies links to its evidence via an `` evidence '' attribute .",
