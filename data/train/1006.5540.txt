    "when discussing collective modes in quantum many - body systems at finite temperatures , there are two regimes of interest : the collisionless ( or mean - field ) regime and the collisional ( or hydrodynamic ) regime .",
    "the mechanisms for the occurrence of collective modes in these two regimes differ critically .",
    "one of the collective modes is the first sound in the collisional regime , which is due to local equilibrium . in a normal fermi system ,",
    "zero sound is a characteristic sound mode in the collisionless regime .",
    "it propagates due to the mean - field interaction .",
    "this zero sound was first predicted by landau  @xcite based on fermi liquid theory  @xcite , and it has been studied in many fields of physics including low - temperature physics , nuclear physics ( hot nuclear matter ) , and astrophysics ( neutron stars ) .    collective modes with time - dependent density disturbances have been investigated .",
    "the crossover between first sound and zero sound was first observed by keen _",

    "density fluctuations have been excited in ultracold atoms by deforming the trapping potential  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to probe collective excitations is to use scattering of lights or particles .",

    "although the crossover between zero and first sound modes has been extensively studied for a long time , there has been no comprehensive study of the dynamic structure factor over the full crossover range from the collisionless regime to the collisional regime within a single theoretical framework .",
    "furthermore , the dynamic structure factor for the crossover from zero to first sound has not been explicitly calculated and it is not obvious how it varies as a function of temperature and interaction strength .",
