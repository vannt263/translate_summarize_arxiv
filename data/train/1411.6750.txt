    "long - range interaction violates some assumptions introduced in the equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , for instance additivity @xcite .",
    "one remarkable phenomenon in such a system is existence of long - lasting nonequilibrium quasistationary states ( qsss ) in the relaxation process , and the life time of qsss diverges in the limit of large population @xcite . in the mean - field limit ,",
    "dynamics of the system is described by the vlasov equation ( or collisionless boltzmann equation ) @xcite , and qsss are regarded as stable stationary solutions to the vlasov equation .",
    "qsss are said to be found in various scales in the nature , from the laboratory scale as the plasma crystals @xcite to extremely large scale as the elliptic or spherical galaxies @xcite .",
    "a central issue of long - range interacting systems is to predict the qss from a given nonstationary initial state .",
    "one theoretical approach is proposed by lynden - bell @xcite , which is originally proposed for the self - gravitating systems and is easy to use for the so - called waterbag initial states .",
    "several tests are performed for the theory in the self - gravitating systems with 1d @xcite , 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite , and the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model ( or the globally coupled xy model ) @xcite . in the self - gravitating systems ,",
    "thanks to homogeneity of potential , initial states are classified by the virial ratio , and the lynden - bell s theory gives good prediction of qsss if initial states satisfy the virial condition .",
    "the concept of virialization is extended for nonhomogeneous potential of the hmf model @xcite to avoid parametric resonance making halo @xcite .",
    "the generalized virial condition helps to prepare initial states for which qsss are described by the lynden - bell s theory .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another approach is the rearrangement formula , or the integrable ( uncoupled ) model . in this article",
    "we consider asymptotic states of the vlasov dynamics which are qsss in which we are interested .",
    "the idea to get the asymptotic state is to redistribute the initial distribution along contours of the asymptotic effective hamiltonian , which is determined by the asymptotic state , and to solve the self - consistent equation for the asymptotic state .",
    "the rearrangement formula is introduced without theoretical justification , but is successfully examined in the hmf model for single - level @xcite and multi - level @xcite waterbag initial states numerically .",
    "further , the theory also gives good prediction for 3d self - gravitating systems for the waterbag initial states , and for the parabolic initial states @xcite .",
    "the two different theories of the rearrangement formula and of lynden - bell prefer the generalized virial states , but the former is said to provide more accurate predictions than the latter @xcite .",
    "we then focus on the rearrangement formula rather than the lynden - bell s theory .",
    "another reasoning to focus on the rearrangement formula is that the formula is useful even for non - waterbag initial states .",
    "indeed , for perturbed states from stable stationary states , disordered thermal equilibria for instance , the rearrangement formula is theoretically justified @xcite by use of the asymptotic - transient field decomposition and the transient ( t-)linearized vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "we note that the naming is `` linearization '' , but the equation includes a nonlinear term as shown later . a similar formula is also derived via the variational principle in the context of plasma waves @xcite .",
    "however , as the lynden - bell s theory , the rearrangement formula is not always precise and a previous work @xcite suggests that the stable stationary state with zero landau damping @xcite rate is preferred as the unperturbed states .",
    "we refer to this condition as the no landau damping condition .",
    "it is still unclear if the no landau damping condition is more relevant than the virial condition , and if the former is solely essential , since numerical tests have been performed for a limited situation .",
    "moreover , the no landau damping condition is for the unperturbed states , and hence one may expect a condition for the whole initial state including perturbation .",
    "the main purposes of the present article are to confirm the relevance of the no landau damping condition and to reveal one more condition relating to the casimir invariance by performing systematic numerical simulations of the vlasov equation .",
    "it is important to clarify validating conditions of the rearrangement formula from the following two contexts .",
    "one is as the response theory for external field .",
    "the rearrangement formula gives non - classical critical exponents , and the theoretical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we can further justify the non - classical critical exponents by showing that the validating conditions are satisfied for computing the response .",
    "the other is related to improvement of the theory . after confirming the validating conditions",
    ", it might be possible to improve the theory by including the landau damping into the rearrangement formula , for instance .",

    "response to the external field will be discussed in sec.[eq : response - theory ] , and until then , the external field is set as zero .",

    "we shortly review the rearrangement formula in the absence of the external field .",
    "see @xcite for theoretical justification of the formula .",
    "we start from the initial state @xmath23 close to a spatially homogeneous stable stationary state @xmath24 , and decompose it into the two parts as @xmath25 we note that we can construct the rearrangement formula even if the unperturbed part is spatially inhomogeneous , but we restrict ourselves to the homogeneous case for simplicity .",
    "our interest is to predict the asymptotic state of the vlasov dynamics denoted by @xmath26 , which is assumed to be stationary .",
    "it should be noted that the perturbed state possibly does not go to a stationary state , but to an oscillatory state by forming small traveling clusters under some conditions @xcite .",
    "we do not look into such states in the present article .",
    "one standard method to analyze dynamics around @xmath24 is to linearize the vlasov equation by expanding @xmath27 into @xmath28 the linearized vlasov equation , @xmath29 , g \\ } + \\ { \\mathcal{v}[g ] , f_{\\rm s } \\ }    = 0,\\ ] ] gives the well - known landau damping @xcite of perturbation .",
    "if the landau damping is strong enough , then the asymptotic state @xmath26 may coincide with the initial stable stationary reference @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the landau damping rate is close to zero , then nonlinear trapping @xcite stops the damping , and the system relaxes to a different asymptotic state from @xmath24 . in the latter case ,",
    "due to the nonlinearity , predicting the asymptotic state is nontrivial .",
    "the rearrangement formula is a powerful tool in the latter case as shown in this article .",
    "the key idea of the rearrangement formula is as follows .",
    "imagine that the initial state @xmath23 asymptotically goes to a stationary state @xmath26 , which is still unknown .",
    "the asymptotic state constructs the asymptotic effective hamiltonian @xmath30 $ ] of the vlasov equation , and the asymptotic hamiltonian drives the system for a long time and takes it to the asymptotic state @xmath26 .",

    "the above idea is theoretically formulated as follows .",
    "we decompose @xmath27 into another way as @xmath31 where @xmath26 and @xmath32 are respectively called the asymptotic ( a- ) and ( t-)parts . the a - part @xmath26 is picked up by use of a special case of the abel s formula , @xmath33 and coincides with @xmath34 if it exists . according to the a - t decomposition ,",

    ", we have @xmath37 if @xmath27 is always in an @xmath38 neighborhood of @xmath23 , we can approximate the above exact equation as @xmath39 by omitting @xmath40 term which couples with the t - part @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the approximated equation is not just a linearized equation like eq .",
    "for @xmath38 terms , since @xmath27 includes the @xmath42 term of @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , the term @xmath43 has nonlinearity .",
    "we remark that the criteria of truncation concerns to the surviving time scale of each term @xcite .",
    "we can show that , under some assumptions , the unknown transient field @xmath41 appearing in the third term of the left - hand - side of eq . does not contribute to determine the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "therefore , _ roughly _ speaking , the a - part @xmath26 is obtained as the asymptotic solution to the reduced equation @xmath45 temporal evolution of @xmath27 is , hence , obtained as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the orbit of the hamiltonian dynamics governed by @xmath44 with the initial condition @xmath48 .",
    "the abel s formula gives @xmath49 and this is the time average of @xmath23 along the orbit of the integrable hamiltonian system @xmath44 .",
    "thus , introducing the angle - action variables @xmath50 associated with @xmath44 , which is written as a function of @xmath51 only as @xmath52 , the ergodic - like formula replaces the time average of eq . with the iso-@xmath51 average @xmath53",
    "this expression is the rearrangement formula , on which we will discuss .",
    "the concrete forms of @xmath50 and @xmath54 is exhibited in the appendix [ sec : explicit - average ] with another equivalent practical expression of the average .",
    "an illustrative presentation of the rearrangement formula is to redistribute height of the initial state @xmath23 uniformly on each contour of the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath44 as described in fig .",

    "we consider a waterbag initial state and divide the phase space into small phase space elements .",
    "due to imcompressibility of the vlasov flow , the phase space elements are exclusive , and hence we redistribute them to phase space as maximizing the fermi - dirac like entropy with keeping the invariants of mass , momentum , and energy . in the former ,",
    "we redistribute the phase space elements as the lynden - bell s theory , but the redistribution is performed on each iso-@xmath51 contour .      from symmetry of the system , we may assume that @xmath58 .",
    "we determine the asymptotic hamiltonian without the external field , @xmath59 by solving the self - consistent equation @xmath60 in the last equality we used the fact that @xmath61 .",
    "the self - consistent equation always has the solution of @xmath62 corresponding to the strong landau damping case , but we skip this trivial solution .",
    "the non - zero solution of @xmath63 , solved numerically , is the theoretical prediction to be examined in sec.[sec : numerics ] . before going to numerical tests ,",

    "the rearrangement formula predicts the asymptotic value of order parameter , @xmath63 , as the solutions to the self - consistent equation , or as approximation .",
    "the zero solution corresponds to the strong landau damping case , and hence the non - zero solution , in which we are interested , might be realized with the no landau damping condition . however , validity of this expectation is still not clear since the rearrangement formula was successfully tested for initial waterbag states satisfying the generalized virial condition @xcite .",
    "then , we will make competition between the no landau damping condition and a virial condition in sec .",
    "[ sec : no - landau - damping ] , and will clarify that the former is more relevant in our setting .",

    "the generalized virial condition represents quasistationarity of a given waterbag initial state @xcite , and it is not straightforward to apply it for other initial states . on the other hand , the proper virial condition is not useful for spatially periodic systems .",

    "the proper virial condition is derived by differentiating @xmath97 and taking long - time average .",

    "we have dealt with the hmf model without external field in secs . [",
    "sec : rearrangement - formula ] and [ sec : numerics ] . in this section ,",
    "we consider response to the non - zero external field and the critical exponents @xmath163 and @xmath164 defined as @xmath165 in the limit of @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is strength of the external field , @xmath168 the initial order parameter , and @xmath169 and @xmath170 are defined in high- and low - temperature sides respectively .",
    "we note that the considering family of states may be thermal equilibrium states or qsss , and a certain parameter plays the role of temperature in the latter qss case .",
    "the rearrangement formula gives the non - classical critical exponents of @xmath171 , @xmath172 @xcite and @xmath173 @xcite in a wide class of 1d vlasov dynamics with the periodic boundary condition @xcite , while statistical mechanics gives @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "we numerically found that the rearrangement formula requires two conditions to be satisfied : one is the no landau damping condition and the other comes from the casimir invariance .",
    "these conditions restrict applicable initial states for the rearrangement formula . however , the conditions reinforce validity of use of the rearrangement formula as the response theory to the external field , which turns on at the initial time and goes to be constant asymptotically , since this setting satisfies both the two conditions as discussed in the following .    performing the laplace transform of the external field",
    "we get a pole at the origin of the laplace space ( the complex frequency plane ) , and the pole provides the asymptotically surviving response @xcite .",
    "we hence conjecture that this pole effectively restores the no landau damping condition even if the unperturbed stationary state breaks the condition .",
    "moreover , for the critical exponents , the interesting reference states are close to the critical state which satisfies the no landau damping condition .",
    "it is not hard to see that the second condition , the casimir invariance , is satisfied for small @xmath167 . as shown in eq .",
    ", invariance of all the casimirs is satisfied by the rearrangement theory up to the linear order .",
    "the critical exponents are defined in the limit of small external field , and hence the casimir invariance is not an obstacle for computing them .",
    "we discussed conditions to use the rearrangement formula around spatially homogeneous stable stationary states in the hmf model , and numerically derived two conditions : one is for the stable stationary reference state , and the other is for the whole initial state .",
    "the former is the no landau damping condition , which was previously suggested @xcite .",
    "we compared this condition with a virial condition , which we called the periodic virial condition , and numerically clarified that the no landau damping condition is more crucial than the periodic virial condition .",
    "the latter comes from the casimir invariance : the theory prefers initial perturbed states which keep the casimirs well . breaking the former and the latter , theoretical predictions tend to overestimate and underestimate respectively , and",
    "hence we may conclude that the two conditions are independent .    due to the conditions , the rearrangement formula is restrictive for using as a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , the theory is useful as a response theory to the external field saturating to a small constant asymptotically , since the conditions are satisfied in such a situation . in particular",
    ", the conditions validate to compute the critical exponents in use of the rearrangement formula .",
    "another important benefit of the present work is that the conditions suggest a direction for improving the rearrangement formula : the theory could be improved by inputting the landau damping and the casimir invariants .",
    "for instance , we expect that nonlinear trapping plays an important role to form a magnetized asymptotic state , and an improved theory may be derived by considering the competition between the linear landau damping and the nonlinear trapping as discussed for forming traveling small clusters @xcite .",
    "such an improvement is interesting and worthwhile for constructing a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , but remains as a future work .",
    "a similar formula with the rearrangement formula has been also derived by de buyl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a small system of @xmath38 contacting with a huge bath of @xmath42 through long - range interactions . in this setting , magnetization in the huge bath plays the role of external field for the system , and the rearrangement formula possibly provides good predictions as discussed in the present article , if the bath is huge enough and static accordingly .",
    "we remark that the system is driven by the bath magnetization only , and no self - consistent condition is needed for the system magnetization , since the latter is small enough and can be omitted .",
    "this article dealt with the hmf model only , but , from physical mechanism leading the two conditions , one may expect that generic systems having long - range interactions share the two conditions .",
    "examinations for several systems remain to be done .",
    "we discussed initial states around stable stationary states , but the rearrangement formula has been successfully used in 3d self gravitating systems with watarbag initial conditions , which satisfy the virial condition @xcite . it also remains to reveal a relation between the two types of initial states , which are perturbed stable stationary states and waterbag states .",
    "we end this article by mentioning the discussion on parametric resonance for initial states which are neither perturbed stable stationary states nor waterbag states satisfying the virial condition @xcite .",
    "we have discussed on the discrepancy induced with the higher fourier modes based on the casimir invariants . on the other hand",
    ", there is another explanation based on the parametric resonance induced by the higher moments @xcite .",
    "clarifying the relation between the two explanations remains as another future work .",
