    "this model describes the interacting lower polariton ( lp ) fields in the two circular polarization states @xmath122/\\sqrt{2}$ ] ( @xmath123 are the linear polarization components ) and the bipolariton @xmath124 field .",
    "such a model is the low - energy effective theory of a more complicated model of interacting excitons strongly coupled to photons .",
    "most properties of the bipolariton field in our model are the same as those of pure biexcitons , although the bipolariton does contain a small photon component .",
    "this small photon component provides crucial distinctions from a pure biexciton state .",
    "in particular , the photon component ensures that optically active states are the lowest in energy .    to clarify these points ,",
    "we give here a short account of the derivation of the effective polariton and bipolariton parameters appearing in the two - channel model , such as the effective interaction strengths @xmath125 ( where @xmath126 ) and the feshbach resonance coupling @xmath42 , the inter - channel detuning @xmath0 , the bipolariton mass @xmath127 , and their dependence on the exciton - photon detuning @xmath12 , where @xmath128 are the photon and exciton energies .",
    "changing the detuning @xmath4 changes the lp composition , and hence affects the polariton dispersion , its scattering properties , and the overlap with the biexciton states .",
    "many of these results are also reported in the manuscript , for completeness we include all relevant formulae here .",
    "the lp dispersion @xmath129 has the form @xmath130 , as given in ( and shown in fig . 1 of ) the manuscript",
    ". the non - quadratic form of this dispersion results from the varying composition of the lp , as determined by the hopfield coefficients , @xmath131 , which give the exciton and photon fraction of the lower polariton at a given momentum @xmath17 .    in order to derive the appropriate dimensionless parameters characterizing the interaction strengths",
    ", it is necessary to identify an effective mass of the lp .",
    "this corresponds to the expansion at small @xmath17 , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 .",
    "this polariton mass is given by @xmath134 where the hopfield coefficients at @xmath135 take a simple form : @xmath136 .",

    "sec : quadratic - vs - non ] , we will compare these results with those obtained in the manuscript by making use of the full lp dispersion .    from the lp dispersion",
    ", we can also express the detuning between closed and open channels ( the inter - channel detuning ) , @xmath137 $ ] , in terms of the exciton - photon detuning @xmath4 : @xmath138 a plot of the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath139 on the detuning @xmath4 for typical gaas parameters can be found in the manuscript fig .",
    "1(c ) .    the background polariton interaction strengths @xmath140 , @xmath141 can be written in terms of the corresponding excitonic interaction strengths .",
    "they depend on the polariton or exciton mass used to define dimensionless interaction constants @xmath142 and @xmath38 , as well as on the excitonic fraction , i.e. , the hopfield coefficient @xmath143 , which introduces a non - trivial dependence of the polariton interaction strengths on the momentum ( @xmath144 ) : @xmath145 where @xmath146 run over @xmath147 only here .",
    "the background bipolariton interaction @xmath41 does not involve the polariton hopfield coefficients because , as we will see below , the bipolariton is strongly excitonic regardless of momentum .",
    "the hybridization ( coupling ) @xmath42 between pairs of lps in opposite polarizations and bipolaritons , as well as the bipolariton mass @xmath127 , can be estimated from the expression for the lp - lp scattering @xmath23-matrix , @xmath148 .",
    "the bipolariton appears as a scattering resonance in this @xmath23-matrix , and its mass depends on the dispersion of that resonance .",
    "the @xmath23-matrix can be evaluated starting from the @xmath23-matrix for two excitons in opposite polarizations , @xmath149 , scattering from momenta @xmath150 to momenta @xmath151 .",
    "assuming that the exciton scattering is dominated by the biexciton resonance , one can assume the following simplified expression for @xmath152 : @xmath153 we then include the exciton - photon coupling to evaluate @xmath154 .",
    "using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , one has that @xmath155 where @xmath156\\ ; , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and where the dispersion of the upper polariton ( up ) is @xmath157 .",
    "the propagator @xmath158 is generally a smooth function of the energy @xmath159 , except at isolated points . for zero center of mass momentum , @xmath160",
    ", these isolated points , where it diverges logarithmically , occur near the 2-particle band - edge energies ( i.e. , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 ) . because @xmath164 , the ratio between polariton and exciton mass @xmath139 also generally satisfies @xmath165 , unless at very large detuning @xmath49 ( see manuscript fig .",
    "1(c ) ) . the existence of this small parameter suppresses the renormalization term @xmath166 .",
    "in general it causes only a small shift of the resonance energy away from @xmath167 , thus giving : @xmath168 the feshbach coupling @xmath42 is related to the resonance width @xmath169 by @xmath170  @xcite , so that @xmath171 we have verified that , for the system parameters relevant for current experiments in gaas ( see later section `` gaas parameters '' ) , the above approximation,@xmath172 is accurate up to @xmath173  mev , and @xmath174  mev away from the resonance ( i.e. , @xmath175 which corresponds to @xmath44  mev ) , with an error below @xmath176 , in the limit @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "thus we have seen that most properties of bipolaritons are the same as those of pure biexcitons .",
    "however , even when the photon fraction is very small , the photon component has crucial effects .",
    "firstly , given the small ratio , @xmath179 , even a 1% photon fraction reduces the polariton mass @xmath180 by two orders of magnitude compared to the bare excitonic mass . as such",
    ", a 99% excitonic polariton system can behave quite distinctly from a pure excitonic system  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the change of mass ( relevant for when later we will make use of the quadratic approximation of the lp dispersion ) there is another significant effect on excitons when including a small mixing with photons . in gaas , excitons can have angular momentum @xmath181 .",
    "these states are almost degenerate , with a weak ( typically a few @xmath52ev  @xcite ) electron - hole exchange term favoring the `` dark '' @xmath182 states  @xcite .",
    "photons couple only to the optically active `` bright '' state @xmath183 thus lower the energy of these states .",
    "if the rabi splitting is typically @xmath184 times larger than the exchange splitting , i.e. a few mev rather than a few @xmath52ev , then only 0.1% photon fraction is required to overcome the exchange splitting .",
    "thus , while the ground state of a pure excitonic system is expected to be dark , the ground state of 99.9% excitonic system is likely bright  @xcite .",
    "such photon induced splitting of bright and dark states can also be important for the bipolariton , even when the bipolariton mass and energy are very similar to those of the biexciton .",
    "in the manuscript we discussed the distinct signatures for detecting the msf and amsf phases .",
    "the clearest signature is that the msf phase would show pair coherence , but no polariton coherence .",
    "experiments to determine whether polariton coherence exists , by measuring @xmath185 are routine and can be extracted from interference fringe visibility maps between two images of the condensate .",
    "measuring such correlations clearly distinguishes the amsf phase from the msf or normal phase .",
    "however , to unambiguously distinguish between the normal and the msf phases it is necessary instead to measure the following molecular first order correlation function @xmath186 . in this section",
    "we present one possible scheme to measure @xmath187 ; a similar setup with spatial resolution could be used to measure @xmath188 . other possible schemes to measure these quantities are possible",
    ", our aim here is to illustrate the possibility of such measurements .",
    "supplemental figure  [ fig : schem - expt ] shows a possible experimental scheme that measures the pair correlations @xmath187 .",
    "the scheme is based on cross - correlation measurements between a pair of balanced homodyne detectors , which separately measure two - time correlations of the different polarization states .",
    "light from the sample is split on an initial beamsplitter and filtered into the two circular polarization components , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this light is then sent through a variable delay interferometer , with an adjustable phase shift @xmath189 for @xmath27 polarization ( @xmath190 for @xmath28 polarization ) .",
    "the same delay is used for both the @xmath27 and @xmath28 branches of the apparatus .",
    "the light is then measured via a balanced homodyne scheme , so that at @xmath191 the output is : @xmath192 [      \\hat{\\psi}^{}_{\\uparrow } ( t ) + i e^{i \\phi }      \\hat{\\psi}^{}_{\\uparrow}(t ' ) ] \\rangle \\\\ & - \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle    [ -i\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger_{\\uparrow } ( t ) + e^{-i \\phi }      \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger_{\\uparrow } ( t ' ) ] [ i \\hat{\\psi}^{}_{\\uparrow }      ( t ) + e^{i \\phi } \\hat{\\psi}^{}_{\\uparrow}(t ' ) ] \\rangle\\\\ & = i e^{i      \\phi } \\langle \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger_{\\uparrow } ( t )    \\hat{\\psi}^{}_{\\uparrow}(t')\\rangle + \\text{h.c.}\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 , @xmath194 is the adjustable delay , and @xmath189 the phase shift .",
    "this signal on its own averages to zero in the msf phase as there is no single polariton phase coherence .",
    "a similar form applies for the lower branch of the interferometer @xmath195 with @xmath196 and @xmath197 . when calculating the cross correlation @xmath198 , one therefore obtains a signal : @xmath199 in the absence of a symmetry breaking magnetic field",
    ", correlations should be invariant under the replacement @xmath200 and so the middle two lines involve the same expectation . choosing",
    "@xmath201 then means these middle two lines vanish .",
    "choosing also @xmath202 , so that @xmath203 , the first and last lines have the same prefactor giving : @xmath204 in the steady state , this implies that @xmath205 , and as the coherent part of the two - time correlation function should be symmetric in @xmath194 , such a scheme allows measurement of the pair coherence .",
    "in the manuscript we always use the full lp dispersion @xmath206 .",
    "it is however instructive to compare this to the quadratic approximation @xmath207 discussed above .",
    "this approximation corresponds to assuming that the occupation of the low - momentum polariton states dominates all relevant expectations values , and so in this limit it is consistent to also replace all hopfield factors with @xmath208 .    approximating the lp dispersion by its low - momentum expansion",
    "is expected to be accurate in the limit when fluctuations beyond mean - field are small : the mean - field results do not depend on the polariton dispersion at all , since they involve only the @xmath135 fields . as discussed in the manuscript ,",
    "in the photonic limit the small polariton mass @xmath209 suppresses fluctuations , however at large @xmath4 , fluctuations are significant , and the full dispersion yields different predictions .",
    "nonetheless , all the qualitative features of the phase diagrams obtained by using the full lp dispersion can be explained also by considering the quadratic approximation .     in the quadratic approximation @xmath210 ( solid lines ) , and with the full lp dispersion @xmath129 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the latter correspond to the boundaries shown in the fig .  2 of the manuscript .",
    "notation and color scheme are the same as in the manuscript.,width=307 ]    we plot in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : compare - q - nq ] the comparison between the phase diagram at @xmath54 in the quadratic approximation , and with the full dispersion .",
    "the basic topology is qualitatively the same , with the difference that in the quadratic approximation the msf - amsf phase separation re - emerges only at very large @xmath4 compared with the case of the full lp dispersion .",
    "this can also be seen more clearly in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : heavyt0 ] which shows the results of the quadratic approximation , but choosing a `` heavier '' cavity photon mass , @xmath211 .",
    "this demonstrates that this feature is not dependent on the non - quadratic dispersion , but arises whenever the polariton density of states becomes very large , as occurs at large detunings .",
    "this in turn leads to a fluctuation dominated regime , which can drive the phase boundary first order .",
    "since the full lp dispersion becomes strongly excitonic at large momentum , this generally increases the polariton density of states as compared to the quadratic approximation , enhancing such an effect .    .",
    "this shows that the phase separation occurring at large @xmath4 is not specific to the non - quadratic polariton dispersion.,width=307 ]    in a similar way , other apparent differences between the quadratic approximation and the full dispersion cases arising at finite temperature can also be shown to be reproduced in the quadratic approximation with heavier photons .",
    "for example , the phase diagram at @xmath117k shown in fig . 3 of the manuscript , and s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - t ] appears to behave differently at low temperature .",
    "the behavior of the full dispersion is however closely replicated by the quadratic approximation if one takes @xmath212 , as shown in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : heavydelta10 ] .",
    "this confirms the statement that while the full dispersion introduces important quantitative changes , no qualitatively new behavior occurs due to the full dispersion .",
    "mev , calculated in the quadratic approximation but taking artificially large cavity photon mass @xmath213 .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the behavior seen in fig .",
    "3 of the manuscript.,width=307 ]    the use of the quadratic approximation has the advantage to allowing significantly faster determination of the phase boundaries in our variational approach .",
    "the variational approach requires finding the free energy for each value of the variational parameters , and this requires estimating the integrals @xmath214 and @xmath215 . within the quadratic approximation ,",
    "these integrals are almost all analytic .",
    "this significant speedup allows a more comprehensive study of the three dimensional phase diagram ( temperature @xmath23 , detuning @xmath4 versus either density @xmath53 or detuning @xmath52 ) , for which the full dispersion would be prohibitively computationally expensive . as such",
    ", the remainder of this supplemental material presents a comprehensive set of phase diagrams calculated in the quadratic approximation .",
    "in the manuscript we presented several cuts through the three - dimensional phase diagram as a function of temperature , detuning and density ( or chemical potential ) for parameters relevant to gaas .",
    "these cuts illustrate the main features that can be seen , namely the sequence of n - msf - amsf transitions and the direct n - amsf transition ; the existence of a first order transition and the associated phase separation ( ps ) near resonance at all temperatures , and the temperature dependence of the various phase boundaries . in this section",
    "we provide further cuts to illustrate more fully how the shape of the phase diagram evolves with changing detuning and temperature .",
    "below we first present further figures illustrating the behavior for the system parameters which are relevant for gaas microcavities .",
    "then we compare the form of the phase diagram for gaas parameters with that for zno parameters .",
    "for three different fixed temperatures ( @xmath216  k , @xmath217  k , and @xmath218  k ) . notation and color scheme are the same as those in the manuscript fig .",
    "3 . for the last panel ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath218  k , we also show the behavior of the n - ps - amsf weakly first order boundary at low density and for negative detuning @xmath4 ( please note the log - scale in density ) . as also discussed below , the behavior of the n - ps - amsf first order transition for large and negative detunings @xmath4 follows the bkt scaling @xmath219 , where @xmath180 is the lp mass .",
    "thus , at fixed temperature , it exists a small , but finite , critical density for the n - ps - amsf transition which is around @xmath220 order of magnitudes smaller than the critical density for the n - ps - msf transition at positive and large detunings ( which follows @xmath221).,width=307 ]      for gaas , we fix the photon mass to @xmath222 , the exciton mass @xmath223 , the rabi splitting @xmath5  mev , the biexciton binding energy @xmath6  mev , and the excitonic resonance width @xmath224  @xcite . additionally , @xmath225  @xcite and we also fix @xmath226 and @xmath51 . additional cuts through the phase diagram to those provided in the manuscript are here given in s.  figs .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] and  [ fig : gaas - vs - t ] .",
    "these show cuts at various fixed temperatures ( s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] ) or fixed detunings ( s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - t ] ) .    the zero temperature phase diagram ( see manuscript fig .",
    "2 ) is characterized by phase boundaries that are mostly second order , with a limited region in detuning near the resonance where the transition either between msf - amsf or n - amsf is first order , thus implying phase separation ( ps ) for a range of densities . however , as s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] and s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - t ] clearly show , at any non - zero temperature , all phase boundaries that were second order at zero temperature , evolve at finite temperature to weakly first order  as calculated within variational mean - field theory ( vmft ) .",
    "this is because , as discussed in the manuscript , at finite temperature , the real phase transitions are of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type , involving a jump in the superfluid density , and vmft approximates this by a weakly first order transition .",
    "the size of the jump depends on the mass of the condensing boson , and so the n - amsf or msf - amsf transitions ( determined by the polariton mass ) show a very small jump .",
    "this density jump at the msf - amsf is just visible in the cut at @xmath227  k in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] , and is more pronounced in the manuscript fig .  3 top panel where @xmath115  k. in the lower temperature cuts in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] the jump is hardly visible . in contrast",
    "the jump at the n - msf transition controlled by the biexciton mass @xmath228 , and is hence much larger , and so is clearly visible at all temperature in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] .",
    "note also that , at large and negative detuning , the n - amsf transition follows the bkt scaling @xmath219 , where @xmath180 is the lp mass , while at large and positive detuning , the n - msf transition follows @xmath229 and it depends on the biexciton mass @xmath228 . in particular , the amsf region at large and negative detuning extends down up to a critical finite density ( at finite temperature ) , as it is clearly shown in the low - density magnification of the bottom panel ( @xmath230  k ) of s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - detun ] .",
    "since all phase boundaries are ( at least weakly ) first order , there are no true tricritical points , however the cuts at @xmath216  k and @xmath217  k show a remnant of the @xmath54 tricritical points ( where the n - amsf transition changes order near @xmath233  mev , and where the msf - amsf transition changes order near @xmath234  mev ) . at such points",
    "the finite temperature transition switches from being very weakly first order ( controlled by the polariton mass ) to being strongly first order , due to the resonance . as the temperature increases ,",
    "while the lower `` tricritical point '' does not change substantially , the triple point approaches the upper `` tricritical point '' , so that , for @xmath235  k , the `` tricritical point '' and triple point have merged , as seen in the bottom panel of the s.  fig .  [",
    "fig : gaas - vs - detun ] .    the cuts at fixed @xmath4 in s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gaas - vs - t ] show the same evolution that we have just described at fixed @xmath23 .",
    "the size of jump in density at the amsf - msf transition is determined by whether the detuning is above or below the @xmath54 tricritical point . at @xmath236  mev ( which , at @xmath54 , is in between the critical end - point and the upper tricritical point ) , there is a first order transition between msf - amsf even at zero temperature .",
    "the panel at @xmath232  mev is very close to ( and slightly above ) the @xmath54 upper tricritical point , so the msf - amsf transition is second order at zero temperature and evolves to strongly first order at higher temperatures .",
    "finally , for @xmath117  mev , the zero temperature transition is second order and becomes ( weakly ) first order at non - zero temperature .",
    "the finite temperature phase diagrams presented above indicate that the msf region shrinks on either reducing the detuning @xmath4 or on increasing the temperature @xmath23 .",
    "this behavior can be quantified by evaluating the location of the triple point at which n , msf and amsf phases all meet . in order for an msf phase to be possible",
    ", one must have a lower temperature , or a larger @xmath4 than that of the triple point .",
    "supplemental figure  [ fig : triple - point ] shows the evolution of the detuning of the triple point vs temperature  note that at @xmath54 the triple points ( squares ) evolves into a critical end - point ( diamond ) .",
    "we show results both for gaas parameters as discussed above , as well as for zno parameters discussed below .",
    "one may use the hopfield coefficient @xmath237 to translate a detuning into an excitonic fraction ; this is shown in the right panel of s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : triple - point ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure that while the msf phase can be reached for the commonly used microcavities made of gaas , it requires relatively low temperatures , and high excitonic fractions . in zno , however , the conditions are significantly more favorable .",
    "it should however be noted that comparing fig .",
    "3 of the manuscript to the @xmath117  mev panel in s.  fig  [ fig : gaas - vs - t ] shows that the quadratic approximation may significantly underestimate the critical temperature .",
    "this suggests experimental parameters may be even more favorable than s.  fig .",
    "[ fig : triple - point ] indicates .        for zno ,",
    "while the photon and exciton masses are similar to those of gaas , @xmath222 and @xmath238 ( for the exciton mass see the supplementary information of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the most important change is the significant increase of biexciton binding energy to @xmath239  mev  @xcite ( also the exciton binding energy increases from @xmath240  mev for gaas to around @xmath241  mev , depending on the well width ) . the rabi - splitting for zno also is typically larger than for gaas , reaching values up to @xmath242  mev  @xcite .",
    "however , for the observation of the msf phase , it is in fact advantageous to consider a smaller rabi splitting than the largest values that have been achieved  @xcite , and we fix @xmath243  mev . reducing the rabi splitting is easy to achieve , by using a longer microcavity , with a higher mode volume . we hence choose a reasonable value where the msf phase occurs at easily attainable detunings and temperatures .",

    "<S> we consider the possible phases of microcavity polaritons tuned near a bipolariton feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , as well as the regular polariton superfluid phase , a `` molecular '' superfluid exists , with ( quasi-)long - range order only for pairs of polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the experimental signatures of this state . using variational approaches </S>",
    "<S> we find the phase diagram ( critical temperature , density and exciton - photon detuning ) . unlike ultracold atoms , the molecular superfluid is not inherently unstable , and our phase diagram suggests it is attainable in current experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the wealth of physics explored with ultracold atomic gases  @xcite relies on the ability to tune parameters such as the interaction strength . a crucial tool to achieve this is the feshbach resonance mechanism  @xcite : by using a magnetic field one may vary the detuning @xmath0 between two channels ( hyperfine states ) of the atoms ; a closed channel ( bound molecule ) and open ( scattering ) channel . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 is large and positive , the closed channel is far above open channel atoms , the formation of molecules is energetically suppressed and atoms scatter with a weakly attractive effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 is large and negative , atoms are paired into molecules and the effective interaction is weakly repulsive . near resonance ( @xmath1 ) , the interaction is very large . </S>",
    "<S> this enables tunable pairing and regimes of strong correlations , allowing many interesting possibilities both at few- and many - body level .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atom experiments are however intrinsically metastable , not true minima of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> three - body collisions must be avoided to prevent relaxation to , e.g. , a solid phase . </S>",
    "<S> also , feshbach molecular states are highly rovibrationally excited states and can relax to lower states . </S>",
    "<S> exploring regimes of strong interactions while suppressing such relaxation processes is inherently challenging . </S>",
    "<S> for fermionic atoms , pauli exclusion suppresses scattering rates , so strongly interacting regimes can be accessed . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there is a smooth crossover between a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) condensate of weakly attractive fermions and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of repulsive molecules  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation for bosons near a feshbach resonance differs substantially : unlike fermions , both a condensate of molecules and a condensate of unpaired bosons can exist . as discussed below this </S>",
    "<S> means that a `` molecular '' superfluid phase with no off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) for atoms can arise , with a further symmetry breaking phase transition between `` atomic '' and `` molecular '' superfluids . </S>",
    "<S> bosonic mixtures have attracted considerable theoretical interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , experiments have been limited by stability issues : the molecular superfluid phase generally requires high densities  @xcite , where three body losses are significant  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there have been suggestions to use optical lattices  @xcite to reach the strongly interacting regime while avoiding high densities , but to date , molecular pairing phases of bosonic atoms remain elusive .    </S>",
    "<S> microcavity polaritons  @xcite , the quasiparticles resulting from strong coupling between cavity photons and quantum well excitons , do not suffer the metastability problems of cold atoms and so present a more promising venue to study bosonic pairing phases . </S>",
    "<S> microcavity polaritons have been observed to form a bec  @xcite , and , as recently discussed  @xcite , interactions between polaritons with opposite polarizations can support either a bound state ( bipolariton ) or a scattering resonance depending on the exciton - photon detuning . </S>",
    "<S> several signatures of this physics have been seen  @xcite , including recent direct observations of the scattering resonance vs detuning  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> polaritons are expected not to suffer from the issues of three body inelastic losses  @xcite which plague cold bosonic atoms : unlike ultracold atoms , a polariton bec is not a metastable state , rather it is the minimum free energy state as long as the polariton population is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is no deeply bound molecular state below the bipolariton . </S>",
    "<S> polaritons do have a finite lifetime , however recent experiments have demonstrated a 510 fold increase in lifetime  @xcite , leading to a system very close to thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> a full non - equilibrium treatment of spin dynamics and relaxation is beyond the scope of this work . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike cold atoms , such losses are not intrinsically linked to the resonance physics , and so they can be addressed and improved independently . </S>",
    "<S> thus , polaritons may form a more promising venue to study pairing phases .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we explore the phase diagram of collective paired phases arising from a bipolariton resonance in microcavities . by using the cavity - exciton detuning to tune the interactions  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we reveal a phase transition between atomic ( i.e. polariton ) and molecular ( i.e. bipolariton ) bec phases . </S>",
