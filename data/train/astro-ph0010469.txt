    "searches for extrasolar planets have employed four techniques : direct imaging of the star and planet , photometric monitoring for transits , and astrometric and doppler measurements of the reflex motion of the star due to planets .",
    "the imaging technique is difficult because a jupiter - like planet is @xmath010@xmath1 and @xmath010@xmath2 times fainter than a solar - type host star at the visible and thermal ir wavelengths , respectively . the photometric method searches for occultations ,",
    "but can only detect systems with the orbital plane seen edge - on , which is an exceedingly rare circumstance .",
    "for example , a jupiter - sized planet orbiting a solar - type star at 1  au has only @xmath30.5% chance of being in the proper alignment for photometric detection .",
    "the reflex motion of a star due to planets is typically small . to date , only the doppler measurements have been successful in discovering planets around a pulsar @xcite and solar - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the exception of the planets around the pulsar psr1257 + 12 , all other known extrasolar planets are jupiter - sized , 0.211 jupiter masses ( m@xmath4 ) , with orbital semi - major axis ranging from 0.04 au to 3 au .",
    "current searches for extrasolar planets do not explore whether intermediate - mass ( 2  7 m@xmath5 ) stars also possess planetary systems , because these stars , of mk spectral types a and b , have fewer stellar absorption lines available for accurate velocity measurement . furthermore , because they are more massive than solar - type stars , the stellar reflex motion is even smaller .",
    "these difficulties can be circumvented , if one searches for planets around the descendants of these intermediate - mass stars : hot white dwarfs with @xmath6 k. a hot white dwarf s uv radiation will photoionize the planetary atmosphere and recombination lines will be emitted by the planet .",
    "the contrast between the planet s recombination line emission and the stellar spectrum will be the limiting factor for detecting the planet .",
    "the strength of the planet s recombination line emission is proportional to the uv flux where the stellar emission peaks , but the recombination line is emitted at a longer wavelength where the stellar emission is lower ; therefore , the contrast between the planet s recombination line emission and the stellar spectrum is not as extreme as the contrast between the planet and star both in continuum .",
    "thus , it may be possible to find planets around hot white dwarfs by searching for a periodically doppler - shifted recombination line emission superposed on the stellar spectrum .",
    "we have carried out calculations to demonstrate the feasibility of this search , taking into account the stellar evolutionary effects . in this letter",
    "we report the results of our calculations , discuss practical considerations , and present observations of a white dwarf to illustrate observational considerations .",
    "our proposed method to search for planets around hot white dwarfs utilizes recombination lines emitted by the ionized atmosphere of orbiting planets . in order to detect the planetary emission",
    ", the planet s atmosphere needs to contain an abundant element that has recombination lines in easily observable wavelength ranges .",
    "given currently available facilities , hydrogen provides the most observable recombination lines .",
    "therefore , we will consider searching for only jupiter - like gas giants around hot white dwarfs .",
    "the progenitor of a hot white dwarf with @xmath6 k has gone through various evolutionary stages , among which the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase is the stage at which the star has the most pronounced effects on its planetary system , because the star swells up to a few hundred r@xmath5 , and goes through episodes of copious mass loss @xcite .",
    "at least four competing factors may affect the planetary system : ( 1 ) planets engulfed in the stellar envelope will experience a drag force and migrate inward .",
    "( 2 ) the decreasing central star mass will cause the planets to migrate outward .",
    "( 3 ) tidal interaction between a planet and the stellar envelope will slow down the planet s orbital motion and cause it to migrate inward .",
    "( 4 ) planets orbiting an agb star can experience accretion and/or evaporation .",
    "these factors have been taken into account by @xcite in their calculation of the evolution of a star - planet system .",
    "they found that jovian planets engulfed in the agb envelope will either evaporate or accrete mass to become a close companion , depending on the mass of the stellar envelope , the initial mass of the planet , and the initial separation between the planet and the star .",
    "the calculations of @xcite are admittedly qualitative , and there are no theoretical predictions which preclude the existence of jovian planets within a few au of a post - agb star , or a hot white dwarf .",
    "furthermore , a jovian planet has been suggested to be a companion to the hot white dwarf pg  0950@xmath7139 @xcite .",
    "hot white dwarfs with @xmath6 k are powerful sources for h - ionizing uv radiation . in this environment",
    ", the hydrogen - rich outer envelopes of any jovian planets present will be photoionized .",
    "the resulting recombinations will cause the planet to emit hydrogen recombination lines . to calculate the recombination line strengths we have made a number of assumptions and approximations . for the stellar radiation ,",
    "we use a blackbody radiation model to approximate the stellar spectrum and use 1 r@xmath8 as the stellar radius to determine the ionizing photon flux emitted by the star .",
    "we approximate the planetary atmosphere as a plane - parallel slab with physical dimension equivalent to the cross section of the planet . within the slab ,",
    "the uv flux from the white dwarf will ionize the outer layer of the atmosphere , to the point where the number of incident ionizing photons balances the number of recombinations .",
    "in other words , we treat the atmosphere as a  strmgren slab . \"",
    "assuming the ionized atmosphere is at a temperature of 10,000 k , the expected h@xmath9 luminosity is then given by :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the ionizing flux of the white dwarf in number of ionizing photons per second , @xmath12 is the radius of the planet in jupiter radii ( r@xmath4 ) , and @xmath13 is the planet s orbital semi - major axis in au .",
    "we have estimated the expected brightness contrast between a jovian planet and the host star at the h@xmath9 line using the model described above .",
    "the calculations were performed for planets with radii of 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 r@xmath4 and orbital semi - major axes of 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 au over a range of white dwarf temperatures , 20,000200,000 k. the ratio of the jovian planet s h@xmath9 line flux to the underlying stellar flux ( within a comparable bandwidth , @xmath14  , the expected thermal width of the h@xmath9 line ) is shown in figure  [ fig : slab ] .    from this simplistic model , it can be seen in figure  [ fig : slab ] that the ratio between the planet s h@xmath9 line emission and the stellar continuum emission can be as high as @xmath01/20 for a jupiter - sized planet at 1 au from a @xmath0200,000 k star . this model",
    ", however , ignores many effects which will lower the contrast between the planet and star .",
    "for instance , in a dense , molecule - rich planetary atmosphere , h@xmath15 can react with atoms or molecules rather than recombine with a free electron ; thus , the planetary h@xmath9 emission will be reduced .",
    "furthermore , many hot white dwarfs show narrow h@xmath9 and @xmath166560 line emission superposed on broad h@xmath9 and absorption @xcite because of non - lte ( non - local thermal equilibrium ) effects in the stellar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this will complicate the search for planetary h@xmath9 emission .",
    "therefore , the results in figure  [ fig : slab ] portray an overly optimistic view of the detectability of jovian planets around a hot white dwarf . on the other hand",
    ", the photoionization - driven ablation of a planetary atmosphere may produce an extended low - density ( @xmath17 h - atom  @xmath18 ) nebula , and the forbidden lines emitted form this nebula can be easily detected @xcite .",
    "to detect the h@xmath9 emission from a jovian planet around a hot white dwarf , multi - epoch , high - dispersion , high - s / n spectroscopic observations of a large sample of hot white dwarfs are needed . below are some of the observational considerations for such a search .",
    "* velocity resolution : the orbital velocity of a planet within 5 au of the host star will be @xmath1910 km  s@xmath20 . to be able to detect this motion , the precision of the velocity measurements should be @xmath012 km  s@xmath20 .",
    "this can be easily achieved with a high - dispersion spectrograph with r = 30,000 . *",
    "large telescope : a sensitive search for recombination line emission from a planet requires a high signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) . to achieve a s / n ratio of 100 for a 13.5 mag star with a reasonable exposure time ( @xmath31.5 hours )",
    ", the telescope must be at least @xmath214  m in diameter .",
    "* long slit : due to the possible faintness of the planetary recombination line emission , telluric and interstellar line emission can interfere with the detection of the planetary lines . to facilitate the removal of telluric and interstellar line emission , a long slit is required for the observations . *",
    "multi - epoch observations : given the range of semi - major axes over which this method is likely to detect h@xmath9 emission from a planet ( a few au ) , multiple epoch observations separated by 46 months are required to detect any change in the h@xmath9 emission line due to the orbital motion of the planet .",
    "planetary h@xmath9 emission may be distinguished from stellar h@xmath9 + emission by the periodic velocity change of the planetary emission .",
    "monitoring observations over a period of 23 years will be needed to determine the planetary orbital elements . * planetary mass measurements : unlike reflex motion planet searches , the velocity shift observed is that of the planet rather than that of the host star .",
    "the mass of the planet can not be accurately determined from this motion .",
    "therefore , astrometric measurements of the reflex motions of the host white dwarfs are needed to determine the masses of discovered planets .",
    "the hot white dwarf feige  34 was observed on 2000 april 23 ( ut ) with the echelle spectrograph on the 4-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the high - dispersion spectra were obtained using the echelle grating in combination with a cross disperser and the long focus red camera .",
    "a reciprocal dispersion of at h@xmath9 was achieved with this setup .",
    "the spectra were imaged with the t2 kb ccd detector .",
    "the pixel size is 24  @xmath22 m , corresponding to 024  pixel@xmath20 along the slit and along the dispersion axis .",
    "two 1800  s exposures were taken of feige  34 with an east  west oriented 20-long slit of width 15 .",
    "the h@xmath9 region of the echellogram is presented in figure  [ fig : echelle ] .",
    "all of the data were reduced using standard routines in iraf .",
    "the echellogram of feige  34 shows broad h@xmath9 + absorption from the white dwarf superposed with a narrow h@xmath9 emission component and a faint emission component ( marked in figure  [ fig : echelle ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath9 emission component has a fwhm of @xmath070 km  s@xmath20 ; it appears offset blueward from the center of the absorption because the absorption is a blend of a strong h@xmath9 line and a weak line . using the observations of @xcite for a flux calibration , we determine the h@xmath9 flux of the emission component to be",
    "this large flux and the lack of interstellar emission features on the palomar sky survey plates rules out an interstellar origin for this emission component .",
    "furthermore , the lack of forbidden line emission excludes the possibility that the h@xmath9 emission arises from a typical circumstellar nebula .",
    "it is possible that this h@xmath9 emission is dominated by the stellar h@xmath9 emission due to a non - lte atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this does not , however , exclude the possibility that the non - lte stellar emission is superposed with weak h@xmath9 emission from an orbiting planet or low - mass dwarf companion .",
    "a low - mass red dwarf companion to feige  34 has been suggested by @xcite based on an infrared excess in jhk bands .",
    "alternatively , a large planet close to the star , heated by the uv flux , may also produce the observed infrared excess . to distinguish between these two possibilities ,",
    "further theoretical and observational work is required .",
    "detailed modeling of a non - lte white dwarf atmosphere for feige  34 is needed to quantitatively assess whether all or part of the h@xmath9 emission feature in the spectrum of feige  34 arises from the star .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations are necessary to determine whether the h@xmath9 emission line profile shows temporal variations suggesting the existence of a companion .",
    "if temporal variations are detected , further monitoring observations would allow the orbital parameters and nature of the companion to feige  34 to be determined .",
    "we suggest that high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of hot white dwarfs can be used to search for h@xmath9 emission from jovian planets within a few au of the star .",
    "h@xmath9 emission from the ionized outer envelope of a jovian planet as weak as 1/100 the stellar emission can be detected with modern large ( @xmath214-m ) telescopes .",
    "non - lte effects in the hot white dwarf atmosphere may produce stellar h@xmath9 emission .",
    "stellar and planetary h@xmath9 emission can be disentangled by multi - epoch observations if changes in the h@xmath9 emission line profile due to the orbital motion of the planet are detected . monitoring observations to establish the orbital parameters",
    "are required to distinguish between jovian planets and a low - mass dwarf companion .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of feige  34 demonstrate the complexity and feasibility of this method to search for these planets .",
    "such a search will provide targets for future high - precision astrometric observations ( e.g. , sim , adaptive optics , etc . ) , and valuable insight can be obtained on the development and evolution of planetary systems around stars more massive than the sun ."
