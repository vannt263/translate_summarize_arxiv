    "the study of the interference behaviour of quantized light has not only been of fundamental interest , but has also been important for applications , such as the use of nonclassical light in highly sensitive interferometry . in particular ,",
    "two - photon interference experiments have offered new possibilities of studying fourth - order interference phenomena of single - photon wave packets @xcite .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is the anticorrelation of the photoelectric counts recorded in the two output channels of a beam splitter @xcite or an optical fibre multiport @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the coincidence events on the optical delay between the two interfering wave packets can be used to determine the photon tunneling time through an optical barrier @xcite .    in order to explain the anticorrelation ( bunching ) behaviour of interfering single - photon wave packets in the output channels of a beam splitter , it has been argued that when two photons arrive at the beam splitter simultaneously , then the outgoing state is obtained by superposition of probability amplitudes , because of the indistinguishability of the photons .",
    "such an interpretation could imply the conclusion that the interference phenomenon observed is a pure quantum effect . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown that the effect also appears for independent classical light fields @xcite .",
    "it may therefore be expected that classical and nonclassical light fields give rise to quantitatively rather than qualitatively different interference structures of the coincidence - event statistics . in this context",
    ", the question arises of what is the effect on the interference fringes of correlated incoming beams and whether or not the interference fringes enable one to distinguish between classical and nonclassical light .    in this paper",
    "we show that when single - photon wave packets whose superposition gives rise to anticorrelations in the coincidence - event statistics in the two output ports of a beam splitter are sufficiently strong distorted by a multilayer dielectric slab and a superposition of the distorted wave packets is measured , then correlations can be observed in place of anticorrelations .",
    "such a behaviour may be regarded as a kind of `` antibunching '' , which would be expected for fermionic particles rather than photons .",
    "clearly , identifying the distorted wave packets with single photons can be quite questionable , as has been stressed recently @xcite .",
    "moreover , correlations can only be observed when the two incoming wave packets are produced by the same source and the overall field is in a correlated state .",
    "we analyse possible interference structures and discuss criteria for deciding from the observed interference fringes whether the incoming fields are classical or not and whether they are correlated or independent of each other .",

    "clearly , such a behaviour can not be explained from interference of probability amplitudes of indistinguishable quanta , but this is not very surprising if we recall the strong distortion of a wave packet at such a barrier @xcite .    since with increasing number of layers , @xmath1 ,",
    "the transmittance of the barrier drastically decreases , it may be difficult to observe the effect in the scheme considered so far .",
    "however , it may easily be observed if the laser is detuned such that the band - shape function @xmath89 bridges over a band - gap edge of the barrier and sufficiently overlaps a region of ( fractional ) transparency . from the interference fringes shown for the quantum regime in fig .",
    "5 , in which @xmath107 is assumed to be centered at the upper band - gap edge ( @xmath116 phz ) , it is clearly seen that the number of coincidence events can be reduced as well as enhanced ( @xmath113 @xmath115 @xmath10 ) .",
    "note that with decreasing @xmath1 the main minimum survives , whose position at indicates subliminal behaviour .",
    "it could be thought that the effect of enhanced coincidences results from the distortion of the wave packet at the barrier relative to the undisturbed wave packet in the other arm of the interferometer . that this is not the case",

    "it is assumed that the two wave packets are distorted in the same way , introducing identical bragg mirrors in the two arms of the interferometer ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "in contrast to fig .  5 however , @xmath111 is now a symmetric function of @xmath91 , @xmath117 @xmath2 @xmath111 , because of the symmetry of the equipment .    for comparison ,",
    "let us now consider disentangled two - photon states in the quantum regime or two uncorrelated classical pulses , i.e. , light beams which are produced by independent sources . in this case in eqs .",

    "enhanced coincidences ( as shown in figs .",
    "4  6 ) can therefore be regarded as being a signature of correlated beams .",

    "usually the observed dependence of the interference fringes on the optical - path difference in the interferometer indicates that the wave packets prefer to arrive at equal output ports rather than different ones which in a sense can be interpreted as a `` bunching '' behaviour .       however , when correlated wave packets are sufficiently distorted , then the opposite effect can also be observed , i.e. , different output ports are preferably used and hence the number of coincidence events is enhanced , in correspondence to an `` antibunching '' behaviour of the wave packets at the beam splitter .",
