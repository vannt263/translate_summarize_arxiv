    "assuming that x - ray clusters correspond to virialized , dark matter halos , the press - schechter mass function ( e.g. , press & schechter 1974 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) describes how the x - ray - selected cluster mass function evolves with redshift and how the cosmological parameters affect this evolution .",
    "in particular , the cosmological mass density parameter , @xmath9 , strongly affects how this mass function evolves above @xmath10 ( @xmath11 m@xmath12 ) .",
    "consequently , by fitting this mass function to present and future x - ray cluster catalogs , this cosmological parameter can be constrained .",
    "unfortunately , x - ray - selected cluster mass catalogs that span sufficiently broad ranges in @xmath13 and @xmath14 to constrain @xmath9 do not yet exist . since the press - schechter mass function already assumes that x - ray clusters are virialized , one may convert this mass function to a temperature function with the virial theorem ; however , x - ray cluster temperature catalogs that span sufficiently broad ranges in @xmath1 and @xmath14 to strongly constrain @xmath9 also do not yet exist ( viana & liddle 1998 ; blanchard , bartlett , & sadat 1998 , however , see henry 1997 ; eke 1998 )",
    ". however , several x - ray cluster luminosity catalogs span sufficiently broad ranges in @xmath0 and @xmath14 to strongly constrain @xmath9 , and the number of such catalogs is growing .",
    "however , to fit the press - schechter mass function to such catalogs , one must invoke a luminosity - temperature ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) relation in addition to the virial theorem .",
    "theoretically , a variety of @xmath0-@xmath1 relations have been proposed ( e.g. , kaiser 1986 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; kaiser 1991 ) ; consequently , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation should be determined empirically . until recently , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of temperature catalogs have suffered from much scatter ( e.g. , edge & stewart 1991 ; david 1994 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) ; however , recently , markevitch ( 1998 ) , allen & fabian ( 1998 ) , and arnaud & evrard ( 1998 ) have published temperature catalogs with temperatures and luminosities that have either been corrected for , or avoided the effects of cooling flows ( see  2 ) ; the result is a significant reduction of this scatter",
    ". this may be the key to determining cosmological parameters with x - ray cluster catalogs : given a well - constrained @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , the press - schechter mass function may be fitted to the growing number of independent , high - redshift , high - luminosity x - ray cluster catalogs with well - understood selection functions ( see  3 ) .",
    "a well - defined @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is also necessary for the press - schechter mass function to be fitted to temperature and mass catalogs since all cluster catalogs with well - understood selection functions are x - ray selected ; i.e. , a well - constrained @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is necessary to accurately relate the selection function to the temperature or mass function . for an example , see henry ( 1997 ) .    in this paper , we present a bayesian inference analysis of the markevitch ( 1998 ) and allen & fabian ( 1998 ) cooling flow corrected temperature catalogs that constrains the slope and evolution of the empirical @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in the luminosity range @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 and the redshift range @xmath5 .",
    "we also determine the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation that one should use when fitting the press - schechter mass function to luminosity catalogs for which cooling flow corrected luminosities are not determined and a universal x - ray cluster temperature of @xmath7 kev , is assumed .",
    "we do this in  3 .",
    "we present the model and the data in  2 ; we draw conclusions in  4 .",
    "following the notation of mathiesen & evrard ( 1998 ) , we model x - ray clusters bolometric luminosities with power laws in mass and redshift : @xmath15 combining equation ( 1 ) with the virial theorem yields the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ( e.g. , reichart 1998 ) : @xmath16 the model of cavaliere , menci , & tozzi ( 1997 ) suggests that bolometric luminosity is not well - modeled by a power law in temperature over sufficiently broad temperature ranges : @xmath17 varies from @xmath18 for rich clusters to @xmath19 for groups , in agreement with the observations of edge & stewart ( 1991 ) and ponman ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , in this paper , we are only concerned with the values of @xmath17 and @xmath20 over the luminosity and redshift ranges that the temperature catalogs of markevitch and allen & fabian span : @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath5 . over these luminosity and redshift ranges , equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are reasonable approximations .",
    "fabian ( 1994 ) showed that cooling flows at the centers of x - ray clusters are responsible for most of the scatter in the empirical @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ; this scatter is evident in the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of the temperature catalogs of , e.g. , edge & stewart ( 1991 ) , david ( 1994 ) , and mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) , the temperatures and luminosities of which are not corrected for the effects of cooling flows .",
    "however , the temperature catalogs of markevitch ( 1998 ) and allen & fabian ( 1998 ) are cooling flow corrected , resulting in a significant reduction of this scatter . in figure 1a , we plot the cooling flow contaminated temperatures and luminosities of markevitch and allen & fabian ; in figure 1b , we plot their cooling flow corrected measurements .",
    "the temperature catalog of markevitch spans the luminosity range @xmath2 erg s@xmath21 erg s@xmath4 and the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "cooling flow corrected temperatures and luminosities are measured in the same way for each x - ray cluster : ( 1 ) cooling flow corrected temperatures are measured by modeling and then removing the cooling flow component of _ asca _ spectra of the central region of each x - ray cluster ( markevitch 1998 ) ; and ( 2 ) cooling flow corrected luminosities are measured by excising the central region of _ rosat _ hri images of each x - ray cluster , and then backfilling the excised region using a @xmath23-model .",
    "markevitch measures cooling flow corrected temperatures and luminosities for a total of 31 x - ray clusters .",
    "the temperature catalog of allen & fabian spans the luminosity range @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 erg s@xmath4 and the redshift range @xmath5 .",
    "cooling flow corrected temperatures and luminosities are measured with two different models : model a for non - cooling flow clusters and model c for cooling flow clusters .",
    "allen & fabian designate a cluster as a cooling flow cluster if the upper limit of its central cooling time , as measured from _ rosat _",
    "hri images , is less than @xmath26 years ; otherwise they designate it as a non - cooling flow cluster .",
    "corrected temperatures and luminosities are measured for the cooling flow clusters by modeling and then removing the cooling flow component of _ asca _ spectra of these clusters ( allen & fabian 1998 ; allen 1998 ) ; temperatures and luminosities of the non - cooling flow clusters are measured with an isothermal spectral model ( allen & fabian 1998 ; allen 1998 ) .",
    "allen & fabian measure corrected temperatures and luminosities for 21 cooling flow clusters and temperatures and luminosities for 9 non - cooling flow clusters .",
    "we do not simply fit equation ( 2 ) to the union of the markevitch and allen & fabian catalogs ; instead , we reflect for a moment on how differences in how temperatures and luminosities are measured for these two catalogs , as well as for the two samples of allen & fabian , can affect the results of such a fit .",
    "for example , given that markevitch and allen & fabian do measure temperatures and luminosities differently , and in the case of luminosities , with different instruments , a small , average offset between their respective temperatures and/or luminosities would not be an unreasonable expectation . however , the effect of such an offset can be significant : since the markevitch catalog is a low redshift sample and the allen & fabian catalog is a higher redshift sample , a small offset between the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of these two catalogs can significantly effect the value of @xmath27 , which measures how the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation evolves with redshift . also , since the markevitch catalog is a lower luminosity sample than the allen & fabian catalog , such an offset can also affect the value of @xmath17 . furthermore , given that allen & fabian measure temperatures and luminosities with different models for different clusters - model a for non - cooling flow clusters and model c for cooling flow clusters - a small offset between the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of these two samples might not be an unreasonable expectation either .",
    "in fact , allen & fabian report such an offset between the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of these two samples ; however , as they note , this effect might also be do to physical differences between cooling flow and non - cooling flow clusters .    equation",
    "( 2 ) is a three parameter model ; the parameters are @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and the proportionality factor , call it @xmath28 . to avoid biasing our results due to average offsets between the three samples - the markevitch catalog , the model a sample of allen & fabian , and the model c sample of allen & fabian - we replace equation ( 2 ) with a five parameter model ; the parameters are @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and three proportionality factors - one for each sample - @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the total @xmath32 is given by the sum of the @xmath32 of each of the three samples : @xmath33 where the subscript denotes from which sample the @xmath32 is computed . by bayes theorem ,",
    "the posterior probability distribution for @xmath17 and @xmath20 , @xmath34 , is given by marginalizing the likelihood function , given by @xmath35 , over the other three parameters , assuming a flat prior probability distribution for all five parameters : @xmath36 given equation ( 3 ) , equation ( 4 ) becomes : @xmath37 \\left[\\int_{l_2 } e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2_2(p , s , l_2 ) } dl_2\\right ] \\left[\\int_{l_3 } e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\chi^2_3(p , s , l_3 ) } dl_3\\right].\\ ] ] hence , the posterior probability distribution is simply proportional to the product of the posterior probability distributions of each of the three samples : @xmath38    before we compute these probability distributions , we address a final concern : although by correcting their temperatures and luminosities for the effects of cooling flows , markevitch and allen & fabian significantly reduce the scatter in the empirical @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , they do not completely remove this scatter .",
    "ignoring this scatter leads to sometimes incorrect and always overconstrained values of the fitted parameters .",
    "distribution : @xmath39/\\sigma_{measured , i}^2 ) > \\sum_i([(y_i - y)^2-(y_i - y_m)^2]/(\\sigma_{measured , i}^2+\\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 ) ) = \\chi^2(\\sigma_{measured}^2+\\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 ) - \\chi^2_m(\\sigma_{measured}^2+\\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 ) = \\delta \\chi^2(\\sigma_{measured}^2+\\sigma_{intrinsic}^2)$ ] .",
    "hence , ignoring the intrinsic scatter of data about a model yields artificially high values of @xmath40 , or in bayesian terms , an artificially narrow likelihood function . ]",
    "furthermore , allen & fabian report that the scatter in their cooling flow cluster @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is greater than the scatter in their non - cooling flow cluster @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "this suggests that either the non - cooling flow components of cooling flow clusters are physically more diverse than that of non - cooling flow clusters , or more likely , it is simply more difficult to model a cooling flow cluster than it is to model a non - cooling flow cluster .",
    "we deal with these issues by adding in quadrature to the 1 @xmath41 error bars error bars by scaling the available 90% error bars by a factor of 0.61 . ] in @xmath42 of each x - ray cluster in a given sample , a constant , @xmath43 , which measures the standard scatter in the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation of that sample .",
    "our measure of this standard scatter is @xmath44 ; a similar , yet somewhat cruder measure would be @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we compute different values of @xmath43 for each sample to deal with the observation of allen & fabian that the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of different samples have different scatters ; consequently , we are not losing information from the lower scatter samples , nor biasing our results from the higher scatter samples , by adopting a single value of @xmath43 that is indicative of all of the samples .",
    "we list our values of @xmath43 for each sample in tables 1 & 2 .",
    "we confirm that the scatter in the model c sample of allen & fabian is greater than the scatter in the model a sample of allen & fabian .",
    "we now determine the posterior probability distributions , @xmath34 , of each of the three samples and combine them in accordance with equation ( 6 ) .",
    "credible regions are determined by normalizing the posterior probability distributions ( e.g. , gregory & loredo 1992 ) . in figure 2 , we plot the 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath41 credible regions of the posterior probability distributions of the 9 cluster , non - cooling flow sample ( solid lines ) and the 21 cluster , cooling flow sample ( dotted lines ) of allen & fabian . although the cooling flow sample has more clusters , it is less constraining than the smaller , non - cooling flow sample , because its @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is more scattered than that of the non - cooling flow sample . the straight line in this figure marks @xmath0-@xmath1 relations that do not evolve , given by @xmath47 .",
    "for the top panel of this figure , we used @xmath48 luminosities ; for the bottom panel , we used @xmath49 luminosities .",
    "the dependence of these luminosities upon the value of the hubble parameter is not important , since the hubble parameter can be grouped with the proportionality factor of equation ( 2 ) , which we marginalize over .",
    "finally , we determine one dimensional credible intervals for the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath17 , and @xmath20 , as well as for the evolution parameter @xmath50 , which we list in tables 1 ( @xmath48 ) & 2 ( @xmath49 ) .    in figure 3 ,",
    "we plot credible regions of the combined posterior probability distribution of the allen & fabian catalog ( solid lines ) and the posterior probability distribution of the markevitch catalog ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the combined posterior probability distribution of the allen & fabian catalog is given by normalizing the product of the posterior probability distributions of their model a and model c samples ( figure 2 ) , in accordance with equation ( 6 ) .",
    "since the markevitch catalog is a low redshift sample , it only weakly constrains the value of @xmath20 , which is strongly coupled to the evolution parameter , @xmath50 .",
    "however , this catalog does place a useful constraint upon the value of @xmath17 .",
    "one dimensional credible intervals are again listed in tables 1 & 2 .    in figure 4",
    ", we plot the one dimensional posterior probability distributions , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , of the combined posterior probability distribution , @xmath34 , of the allen & fabian and markevitch catalogs , which is determined in accordance with equation ( 6 ) .",
    "the dotted lines in this figure mark the 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath41 credible intervals ; the 1 @xmath41 credible intervals are also listed in tables 1 & 2 .",
    "the left panels are for @xmath48 and the right panels are for @xmath49 .",
    "the results are well - summarized by the following values : @xmath54 and @xmath55 , or @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "however , these are not the equations that one wants to use when fitting the press - schechter mass function to x - ray cluster luminosity catalogs (  1 ) .",
    "first of all , luminosity catalogs , such as the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) and the southern serendipitous high - redshift archival _ rosat",
    "_ catalog ( southern sharc ) , are not cooling flow corrected . secondly , since spectra are not measured for luminosity catalog clusters , photon count rates are only converted to fluxes and luminosities by assuming spectra for the x - ray clusters . in the cases of these two catalogs",
    ", a @xmath7 kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum is assumed for all of the x - ray clusters .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation that one should use when fitting the press - schechter mass function to luminosity catalogs of this type is best determined by fitting equation ( 2 ) to cooling flow corrected temperatures - which better reflect the masses - and cooling flow contaminated , @xmath7 kev luminosities - which better reflect the observations .",
    "we derive such luminosities from the cooling flow contaminated luminosities of markevitch and allen & fabian by scaling their values to what they would have reported had they assumed a @xmath7 kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum , given their respective bands .",
    "we plot their cooling flow corrected temperatures and these cooling flow contaminated , @xmath7 kev luminosities in figure 1c . finally ,",
    "we repeat the above analysis ; the results are presented in figures 5 , 6 , & 7 , and tables 3 & 4 .",
    "the results are well - summarized by the following values : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , or @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in the previous section , we found that @xmath20 depends upon @xmath62 , and we assumed that this dependence upon @xmath62 is linear .",
    "furthermore , we found that @xmath17 does not depend upon @xmath62 .",
    "these results are easily verified analytically .",
    "let subscript @xmath62 denote `` for an arbitrary value of @xmath62 '' , and let subscript zero denote `` for @xmath48 '' .",
    "then , @xmath63 where @xmath0 is bolometric luminosity and @xmath64 is luminosity distance . to first order in @xmath14 , equation ( 7 )",
    "is equivalent to : @xmath65 together , equations ( 2 ) and ( 8) imply that @xmath66 hence , also by equation ( 2 ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this verifies both that the dependence of @xmath20 upon @xmath62 is linear , and that the magnitude of this dependence is about unity .",
    "this also verifies that @xmath17 is independent of @xmath62 .",
    "arnaud & evrard ( 1998 ) measure the value of @xmath69 from a sample of 24 non - cooling flow and weak cooling flow clusters .",
    "they measure @xmath70 , which is in excellent agreement with our value : @xmath56 .",
    "since their sample is assembled from 18 sources from the literature , we felt that it would be too difficult to deal with potential biases between subsamples of their catalog , as we did in this paper between the three samples of markevitch and allen & fabian ; consequently , we did not include their catalog in our analysis .",
    "however , the fact that our results are in such excellent agreement is reassuring .    in conclusion",
    ", we have constrained the slope and the evolution of the empirical @xmath0-@xmath1 relation using the cooling flow corrected x - ray cluster temperature catalogs of markevitch and allen & fabian , and bayesian inference . for the luminosity and redshift",
    "ranges @xmath2 erg s@xmath71 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath5 , we find that @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we find that the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is consistent with no evolution over this redshift range ; however , we also find that the evolution parameter , @xmath50 , is a function of @xmath62 .",
    "we have also determined the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation that one should use when fitting the press - schechter mass function to x - ray cluster luminosity catalogs such as the emss and the southern sharc .",
    "it differs from the above @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for the reasons stated in  3 .",
    "given the growing number of independent , high - redshift , high - luminosity x - ray cluster catalogs with well - understood selection functions , a well - constrained @xmath0-@xmath1 relation may be the key to measuring cosmological parameters with x - ray cluster catalogs .",
