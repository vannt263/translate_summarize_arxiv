    "boson stars are gravitationally bound macroscopic quantum states made up of scalar bosons .",
    "they differ from the usual fermionic stars in that they are only prevented from collapsing gravitationally by the heisenberg uncertainty principle . for a self - interacting boson field",
    "the mass of the boson star , even for small values of the coupling constant , turns out to be of the order of chandrasekhar s mass when the boson mass is similar to proton mass .",
    "thus , the boson stars arise as possible candidates for non - baryonic dark matter in the universe and , consequently , as a possible solution of one of the outstanding problems in modern astrophysics : the problem of non luminous matter in the universe .",
    "most of the stars are of primordial origin , being formed from an original gas of fermions and bosons in the early universe .",
    "that is why it should be expected that most stars are a mixture of both fermions and bosons in different proportions .",
    "boson - fermion stars are also a good model to understand more about the nature of strong gravitational fields not only in general relativity but also in the other theories of gravity .",
    "the most natural and promising generalizations of general relativity are the scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite . in these theories",
    "the gravity is mediated not only by a tensor field ( the metric of space - time ) but also by a scalar field ( the dilaton ) .",
    "these dilatonic theories of gravity contain arbitrary functions of the scalar field that determine the gravitational `` constant '' as a dynamical variable and the strength of the coupling between the scalar field and matter .",
    "it should be stressed that specific scalar - tensor theories of gravity arise naturally as a low energy limit of the string theory @xcite which is the most promising modern model of unification of all fundamental physical interactions .",
    "boson stars in the scalar - tensor theories of gravity with massless dilaton have been widely investigated recently both numerically and analytically @xcite ( and references therein ) . mixed boson - fermion stars in scalar tensor theories of gravity",
    "however have not been investigated so far in contrast to general relativistic case where boson - fermion stars have been investigated @xcite .    we will consider a static and spherically symmetric mixed boson - fermion star in asymptotic flat space - time . then the main system of differential equations can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath0 + \\left ( \\frac{d\\varphi}{dr}\\right ) ^{2}\\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the formulated boundary value problem ( bvp ) is a two - parametric eigenvalue problem with respect to the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath8 .",
    "let us emphasize that a number of methods for solving the free - boundary problems are considered in detail in @xcite .    here",
    "we aim at applying the new solving method to the above formulated problem .",
    "this method differs from the one proposed in @xcite and for the governing field equations written in the forms ( [ eqi ] ) it possesses certain advantages .",

    "@xmath38  and @xmath8  the independent solving of the system ( [ eqi ] ) in the internal domain @xmath41 $ ] ( inside the star ) requires seven boundary conditions . at the same time",
    ", we have at disposal only six conditions of the kind ( [ bcil ] ) . in order to complete the problem , we set additionally one more parametric condition ( the value of one from among the functions @xmath42 , or @xmath43 ) at the point @xmath44 .",

    "at the same time , only the three boundary conditions ( [ bcer ] ) are given .",
    "let us consider that the solution in the internal domain @xmath41 $ ] is knowledged .",
    "then we postulate the rest three deficient conditions to be the continuity conditions at the point @xmath51 the first of them is similar to condition ( [ dopusl ] ) and the other two we assign to two arbitrary functions from among @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , for example @xmath56    let us suppose that the internal and external solutions are known . generally speaking , for given arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath57 , and @xmath58 the continuity conditions with respect to the functions @xmath59 , and @xmath55 at the point @xmath60 are not satisfied .",
    "we choose the parameters @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in such manner that the continuity conditions for the mentioned functions to be held , @xmath61 these conditions should be interpreted as three nonlinear algebraic equations in regard to the unknown quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "so , we have to solve the nonlinear bvp ( [ eqi ] ) - ( [ dopusl ] ) in conjunction with the algebraic system ( [ cc ] ) .",
    "the traditional technology for solving such problems , based on the methods like shooting @xcite , has some well known disadvantages .    in this paper",

    "it should be pointed that for such small central value @xmath82 we actually have a  pure \" fermionic star . on the figure",
    ", it is seen that from small enough values of @xmath77 , in the vicinity of the the peak the rest mass is greater than the total mass of the star , which means that the star is potentially stable .    on fig .",

    "the presence of the cusp shows that the stability of the star changes  - one perturbation mode develops instability . beyond the cusp ,",
