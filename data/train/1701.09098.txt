    "* ) , which is marginally greater than the 0.1@xmath310 gev luminosity of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 . therefore , one possible scenario is that the le@xmath3he emission of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 is dominated by energy released from the very - intense magnetic field of 1e 1841 - 045 .",
    "the @xmath00.7 gev emission of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 is essentially steady .",
    "both figure  [ lc ] in this work and figure  5 in @xcite ( a long - term light - curve of the sgr 1806 - 20 region ) suggest that , regardless of cosmic - ray origins , @xmath5-ray emissions from magnetars regions may _ not _ vary in response to magnetar outbursts , although the enormous energy ejected from these outbursts triggers abrupt yet dramatic enhancements in x - ray and _ soft _ @xmath5-ray emissions . the 10@xmath3200 gev luminosity of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the spin - down power of 1e 1841 - 045 , but is about an order of magnitude lower than its power of magnetic field decay .",
    "although synchrotron cooling generally makes leptonic cosmic - rays difficult to produce @xmath5-ray photons of a few gev or above via synchrotron radiation , pwne can , with the reduced synchrotron losses for high - energy ic - emitting electrons , maintain their high gev@xmath3tev @xmath5-ray fluxes for timescales exceeding the lifetime of their progenitor pulsars @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in 10@xmath3200 gev , the luminosity and spectral shape of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 are both highly consistent with those of crab nebula s ic component ( see table  [ youngsnr ] , and compare figure  [ 1e_sed ] in this work with figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "crab nebula is a pwn powered by a @xmath21 kyr old pulsar ( as young as the kes 73/1e 1841 - 045 system ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , prompting us to speculate that kes 73 also contains an ic - radiating pwn . on the other hand , a stark contrast between the 0.2@xmath310 gev spectra of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 and crab nebula ( cf .",
    "table  [ youngsnr ] ) makes it _ unreasonable _ to apply the synchrotron component of crab nebula ( for detail , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explain the le@xmath3he emission of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 .",
    "tev - detected pwne should be associated with pulsars releasing power of @xmath0@xmath63 erg s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such required power is greater than the rotational power of 1e 1841 - 045 by three orders of magnitude , but can be afforded by magnetic field decay of 1e 1841 - 045 .",
    "swift j1834.9 - 0846 , the first magnetar confirmed to produce a pwn @xcite , is under a similar circumstance ( cf .",
    "* ) , and hence the wind nebula around it has been argued to be magnetically powered @xcite .",
    "conceivably , magnetar s relativistic outflows , which are accumulated over all outbursts in its history and confined by snr shell , can supply even larger fluxes of wind particles than those supplied in quiescence @xcite .",
    "therefore , 1e 1841 - 045 is sufficient to generate an ic - radiating pwn which may account for a significant portion of the lat flux in the vhe band and/or the hess flux in the tev band .",
    "however , a major uncertainty of this scenario is that there is _ no _ firmly identified pwn inside the snr shell of kes 73 .",
    "subject to assured authenticity of the model prediction for young ( @xmath183 kyr old ) snrs done by @xcite , the le@xmath3he ( 0.1@xmath310 gev ) emission of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 _ can not _ be dominated by snr kes 73 , and is more likely to be dominated by the magnetar 1e 1841 - 045 . whereas , unless more and more young snrs are found to have low 0.1@xmath310 gev luminosities ( like those of cas a , tycho , rx j0852.0 - 4622 and rx j1713.7 - 3946 ) , the credibility of their model for snr evolution may still be challenged .",
    "once it is challenged , we _ can not _ robustly eliminate the possibility of the kes 73 origin for this band .",
    "the vhe ( @xmath010 gev ) emission of _ fermi _ j1841.1 - 0458 is evidently dominated by kes 73 , while a pwn generated by 1e 1841 - 045 , if it exists , is a sufficient yet unnecessary source in this energy band .",
    "we suggest modelling the kes 73/1e 1841 - 045 system as a single source independent from hess j1841 - 055 in the tev regime , so that we can perform physically meaningful comparisons between gev and tev spectra . in turn",
    ", we can compare its gev@xmath3tev spectrum to those of rx j0852.0 - 4622 , rx j1713.7 - 3946 and crab nebula .",
    "how will the gev and tev analyses of this magnetar / snr pair be affected if we assign a different morphology to hess j1841 - 055 ? what should be the refined position and dimension of hess j1841 - 055 so that it excludes the magnetar / snr pair more precisely while retaining all other high - energy components ? to address such crucial issues , ones can start with analyzing tev data collected by hess , magic and/or cta , each of which has a higher sensitivity than the gev - observing _ fermi _ lat .",
