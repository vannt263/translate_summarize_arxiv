    "the coupling of electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is a promising research avenue in the physics of nanoscale systems.@xcite the detection of electromechanical oscillations in suspended graphene @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite represents the current frontier in the field of nanoscale resonators .",
    "suspended carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) constitute a particularly interesting model system due to their remarkable electronic properties inherited from the carbon honeycomb structure , their high mobility as well as their many - faceted mechanical properties such as low dissipation.@xcite this is highlighted by several recent experiments on suspended cnt quantum dots which observe pronounced vibrational effects in electronic transport.@xcite these experiments focus on vibrational sidebands in the coulomb blockade regime and suggest the existence of rather strong but sample dependent electron - vibron coupling , at least for certain vibron modes .",
    "indeed , of the many vibrational modes of cnt , only the radial breathing mode @xcite and the longitudinal stretching mode @xcite have been observed in transport experiments .",
    "the electron - vibron coupling strength seems to vary widely , with some experiments showing only weak , if any , vibronic effects @xcite while others exhibit well - pronounced vibrational sidebands or even the franck - condon blockade.@xcite    most of the corresponding theoretical analysis so far @xcite focused on an electron - vibron coupling of an _ extrinsic _ electrostatic origin .",
    "the basic idea behind this extrinsic coupling is the mechanical deformation of the nanotube induced by the electrostatic interaction between the charge on the nanotube and , e.g. , a nearby gate electrode .",
    "these studies leave several issues unresolved which we address in this paper : ( i ) the estimates do not succeed in justifying the large values of the coupling constant @xmath0 exhibited by some samples .",
    "( ii ) a criterion to determine which vibron modes contribute mostly is still missing .",
    "( iii ) a viable theory must explain the strong sample dependence of the electron - vibron coupling .",
    "in this paper we address these issues by analyzing the contribution to the electron - vibron coupling originating from the _ intrinsic _ electron - phonon coupling in cnt .",
    "this intrinsic coupling originates from two principal mechanisms:@xcite ( i ) the deformation - induced modification of bond lengths induces modulations of the electron hopping in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "( ii ) distortions induce a local variation of areas and generate a deformation potential .",
    "it is interesting to mention that these two coupling mechanisms manifest themselves quite differently in an effective dirac equation of the electronic degrees of freedom which we employ in this work .",
    "while the deformation potential enters the dirac equation as a scalar potential , the bond length modifications enter as a gauge field.@xcite    the coupling constant of the deformation potential is estimated to be about an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding one for hopping modulations.@xcite when combined with symmetry arguments , this allows one to identify which modes couple most strongly to electrons .",
    "longitudinal stretching modes as well as radial breathing modes involve local area variations and couple strongly via the deformation potential , while transverse twist modes involve pure shear and thus couple only via the weaker hopping - modulation mechanism . finally , bending modes , though coupling via the dominant deformation potential , interact only quadratically with electrons , since for symmetry reasons their effect can not depend on the sign of the associated deformation .",
    "thus , longitudinal stretching modes and radial breathing modes are the natural candidates to couple strongly to electrons , in agreement with experimental conclusions.@xcite    to quantify the strength of the electron - vibron coupling in suspended cnt quantum dots , we employ a mapping to an anderson - holstein model @xcite which appropriately describes transport through vibrating quantum dots with a discrete electronic spectrum .",
    "this model assumes that transport occurs through an isolated electronic state coupled to few vibrational modes of the nanostructure .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless coupling constant @xmath0 is given by the shift of the vibron coordinate ( induced by the tunneling electron ) measured in units of the amplitude of its quantum fluctuations ( i.e. the oscillator length ) .",
    "an alternative parameter , often employed in experimental works is @xmath1 .",
    "to lowest order , vibron modes will induce vibrational sidebands when the corresponding electron - vibron coupling @xmath2 is of order unity .",
    "the sidebands will be accompanied by the franck - condon blockade @xcite  a low bias suppression of the current  when @xmath3 .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath2 does not only depend on the specific vibron mode but is also sample specific , for at least two reasons : ( i ) it is sensitive to the geometrical details ( radius or length ) of the cnt , e.g. , through the oscillator length of the vibron .",
    "( ii ) it is sensitive to the location of the cnt quantum dot due to the strain profile of the vibron mode . despite this sample dependence",
    ", we can give estimates of typical values of @xmath2 due to the intrinsic electron - vibron coupling for the different vibron modes of the cnt quantum dots .",
    "for the longitudinal stretching mode , we find upper limit estimates which are significantly larger than unity .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of vibrational sidebands @xcite and of the franck - condon blockade @xcite .",

    "this can be understood in terms of the deformation potential , inducing a positive coupling to electrons for increasing local areas , which is always the case for bending deformations once compared to the equilibrium straight nanotube configuration . in parallel , we notice that the electron - vibron coupling for bending modes is independent of the graphene mass density but is sensitive to both the length and the circumference of cnt , as well as to the electronic localization . in the case of electronic wavefunctions sharply localized near the maximum local strain , the electron - vibron couplings reach the maximum values @xmath196}{l_{\\perp}^{3}[{\\rm nm}]}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\lambda_{m^{\\prime}_{},n^{\\prime}_{},{\\rm max}}^{({\\rm bend } , n\\ge 2)}\\simeq 10^{-4}_{}\\frac{n^{2}_{}+1}{n^{4}_{}}\\cdot\\frac{l_{\\perp}^{}[{\\rm nm}]}{l[{\\rm \\mu m}]}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of transport measurements on suspended cnt , due to their quadratic coupling bending modes do not produce significant franck - condon blockade nor vibrational sidebands at large bias .",
    "we point out that the apparently large coupling constant of the soft @xmath22 mode is in reality suppressed by the fact that all experimentally realized cnt so far have typical values of @xmath169 of several nanometers . as an example",
    ", the ( 10,10 ) armchair cnt is characterized by @xmath197 , yielding @xmath198/(2m^{\\prime 2}_{})$ ] . only the softest bending vibrons in extremely long and thin freely suspended cnt",
    "could ever reach the regime @xmath199 .",
    "in addition , in experiments the contact - induced tension in the cnt stiffens the low energy dispersion of the @xmath22 mode and reduces its oscillator length and coupling strength .",
    "in particular , the coupling constant becomes @xmath200 with the @xmath22 dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ bendingtension ] ) .",
    "we point out that if the cnt shows buckling in its equilibrium configuration ( e.g. via contact - induced compressions at the two ends ) , the symmetry argument for bending modes does not hold and a linear electron - vibron coupling appears . in principle , it is straightforward to treat this situation within the approach presented in this paper .",
    "however , we refrain from giving explicit results here because of the highly non - universal nature of the effect .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a theory of the intrinsic electron - vibron coupling in carbon - nanotube quantum dots .",
    "this intrinsic coupling originates from the electron - phonon interaction of the underlying graphene sheet and is associated with the deformation potential as well as the vibron - induced modulations of the hopping amplitude .",
    "we find that for several vibron modes , including those most prominently observed in experiment , this coupling is larger than the previously considered extrinsic coupling based on electrostatic interactions between the nanotube and a nearby gate electrode .",
    "our results are consistent with recent experiments in several respects .",
    "we find that the most strongly coupled vibron modes are the radial breathing mode and the longitudinal stretching mode .",
    "in fact , it is these modes which have been observed in recent transport experiments.@xcite moreover , we obtain the largest coupling constants for the longitudinal stretching mode , with the maximal dimensionless coupling exceeding unity , consistent with the recent observation of the franck - condon blockade associated with this vibron mode.@xcite    we also find that quite generally , the electron - vibron coupling is rather sample specific .",
    "the coupling depends on the geometric details of the nanotube such as circumference or length and , except for the radial breathing mode , is sensitive to the location of the cnt quantum dot along the vibrating nanotube .    in very clean cnt , where the quantum dot extends over the entire length of the vibrating nanotube",
    ", we find that the electron - vibron coupling is subject to selection rules .",
    "this significantly suppresses vibronic signatures in the conductance which may be responsible for the absence of vibrational features in some experiments on suspended carbon nanotubes.@xcite    in this paper , we have focused on the intrinsic electron - vibron coupling in ideal carbon nanotubes .",
    "realistic samples may also be subject to defects which affect the elastic properties of the carbon nanotubes .",
    "such defects are expected to be particularly significant when they bring the cnt close to an elastic bistability .",
    "another issue which remains an interesting topic for future research concerns consequences of electronic correlations on the electron - vibron coupling .",
    "experiments on nanoelectromechanical systems are characterized by an increasing ability to design and tune the sample properties .",
    "we expect that the results of the present paper will contribute to extend this ability to include the electron - vibron interaction strengths which may make previously unexplored parameter regimes accessible .",
