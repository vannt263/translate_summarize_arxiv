    "( ii ) * this part will be proved from * ( i ) * using a standard conversion technique similar to the one used in lemma [ lemma : 7.28.1 ] . since the number of edges in @xmath258 denoted @xmath259 ,",
    "is binomially distributed on @xmath260 trials with success probability @xmath11 , we have that @xmath261 therefore , if @xmath262 where @xmath263 , then w.h.p .",

    "to finish off the proof that @xmath272 has the same limits , we will use the fact that these properties are monotone .    now an _ increasing _",
    "( _ decreasing _ )",
    "property is a property that is closed under the addition ( deletion resp . ) of edges . for any increasing property @xmath160",
    ", we have that @xmath273 for any @xmath274 .",
    "this fact is obvious when you consider @xmath23 and @xmath275 to be snapshots of the random hypergraph process @xmath276 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath160 is an increasing property , then @xmath277 further , if @xmath160 is decreasing , then the inequalities above are reversed .",
    "consequently , for a monotone property @xmath160 such that both @xmath278 tend to the same number , then @xmath272 does as well .",
    "we prove this lemma using the method of moments ( see @xcite for a description of this method ) . in order to prove the lemma , it suffices to show that for each @xmath280 ( fixed ) , @xmath281 = \\left ( \\frac{e^{-c}}{(k-1)!}\\right)^r.\\ ] ] to compute the @xmath282th factorial moment , note that @xmath283 = e_0 + e_1 + \\ldots + e_{(k-1)r},\\ ] ] where @xmath284 is the expected number of ordered @xmath282-tuples of vertices of degree at most @xmath38 such that there are exactly @xmath285 edges containing at least one of these vertices .",
    "we will see that the terms other than @xmath286 are negligible .",
    "let s first consider @xmath286 .",
    "since the number of edges is @xmath287 , each of these @xmath282 vertices have degree @xmath38 and must necessarily not be adjacent ; so @xmath288 taking on this last factor , we have that @xmath289 by sharply approximating this last fraction , we have that @xmath290 note that @xmath291 we also have @xmath50 so that @xmath292 similarly , we have that @xmath293 further @xmath294 and @xmath295 thus @xmath296    now we turn to @xmath284 , for @xmath297 . note that @xmath284 is less than the expected number of such @xmath282-tuples where these @xmath282 vertices have exactly @xmath298 adjacent edges ( we dropped the degree condition ) .",
    "then , for @xmath297 , we have that @xmath299 in particular , we have that @xmath300 using the fact that @xmath301 along with the bound , we have that @xmath302 } \\left ( \\frac{\\ln n}{n^{d-1 } } \\right)^{(k-1)r - j } \\left ( \\frac{1}{n ( \\ln n)^{k-1}}\\right)^r = \\frac{1}{(\\ln n)^j},\\ ] ] which completes the proof of the lemma ."
