    "observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect : @xcite ) for transiting planetary systems enable us to measure the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis ( also called the projected spin - orbit angle , or the projected obliquity ) .",
    "previous measurements of this angle have revealed the existence of well - aligned prograde orbits ( @xmath6 ; see , e.g. , hd  209458b : , hd  189733b : @xcite ) , highly - inclined prograde orbits ( @xmath7 ; xo-3b : , hd80606b : , wasp-14b : @xcite , corot-1b : @xcite ) , and retrograde orbits ( @xmath8 ; hat - p-7b : @xcite , wasp-17b : @xcite ; triaud et al .",

    "the discovery of highly tilted orbits , and retrograde orbits , has been taken as evidence in favor of `` few - body '' theories for planetary migration , such as planet - planet scattering and subsequent tidal evolution ( planet - planet scattering models , e.g. , @xcite ) , or the kozai mechanism @xcite caused by a distant companion and subsequent tidal evolution ( kozai migration models , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", the rm effect has already played an important role for studies of planetary migration processes .",
    "further measurements of the rm effect are important in order to constrain theoretical models by learning the statistical distribution of spin - orbit alignment angles , and by discriminating planetary migration mechanisms for individual planetary systems . for this purpose , we have continued measurements of the rm effect and have also initiated direct imaging observations , with the subaru 8.2 m telescope , of systems with misaligned planets to search for evidence of perturbing stellar companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the subject of this letter is the transiting exoplanet xo-4b , discovered by @xcite ( hereafter mc08 ) .",
    "the host star xo-4 is a relatively bright ( @xmath9 ) f5 star , and xo-4b is a giant planet ( @xmath10  @xmath11 , @xmath12  @xmath13 ; mc08 ) with an orbital period of @xmath14  days .",
    "we used the flwo 1.2 m telescope for photometric observations and the subaru 8.2 m telescope for radial velocity ( rv ) observations . due to the rapid rotation of xo-4 ( @xmath15  km  s@xmath16 ; mc08 )",
    ", the amplitude of the rm effect for xo-4b was expected to be large .",
    "in addition , recently @xcite reported that hot stars ( @xmath17  k ) with hot jupiters tend to have high obliquities . since xo-4 is a hot star ( @xmath18  k ; mc08 ) with a hot jupiter , we may use this system as a further test of the proposed pattern .",
    "we report our photometric and rv observations in section  2 , and describe our analysis procedures in section  3 .",
    "we present our results and discussions in section  4 .",
    "finally , we summarize the findings of this letter in section  5 .",
    "photometric observations were conducted with keplercam on the 1.2 m telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) on mount hopkins , arizona .",
    "three partial transits , and one complete transit , were observed with a sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) z - band filter .",
    "the observing dates were ut 2008 october 5 ( egress ) , 2008 october 13 ( ingress ) , 2009 september 8 ( ingress ) , and 2010 february 8 ( complete ) .",
    "keplercam is equipped with a 4096@xmath194096 ccd , giving a square field of view 23.1 on a side .",
    "we used 2@xmath192 binning , giving a scale of 0.68  per binned pixel , a readout and setup time of 11 s , and a typical readout noise of 7 e@xmath20 per binned pixel .",
    "the cadence was typically 2  min for the observation on ut 2010 february 8 , and about 50  s for the other observations .",
    "standard iraf procedures were applied to the observed frames for bias subtraction , flat - field division , and aperture photometry .",
    "the flux of xo-4 was divided by the sum of the fluxes of 11 nearby reference stars in the field of view . to account for systematic effects due to differential airmass extinction and imperfect flat - fielding",
    ", we corrected the baseline of the observed flux as a function of time and airmass .",
    "photometric uncertainties were temporarily set equal to the standard deviation of the out - of - transit relative flux on that night . as explained in subsection 3.1 , we subsequently rescaled these uncertainties to account for time - correlated noise .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 shows the composite transit light curves .",
    "we observed xo-4 on ut 2010 january 14 , 2010 january 15 , 2010 february 4 , and 2010 may 17 with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds : @xcite ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope at mauna kea , hawaii . the observations on 2010 january 15 covered a full transit of xo-4b .",
    "we employed the standard i2a setup of the hds , covering the wavelength range 4940    @xmath21 6180   and a slit width of @xmath22 , corresponding to a spectral resolution of about 90000 .",
    "we used the iodine gas absorption cell for precise differential rv measurements .",
    "the exposure times were 1520 min , yielding a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of approximately 80100 per pixel .",
    "we processed the observed frames with standard iraf procedures and extracted one - dimensional spectra .",
    "we computed relative rvs following the algorithm of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we estimated the internal error of each rv based on the scatter among the rv solutions from @xmath234    segments of each spectrum .",
    "the typical internal errors were 915  m  s@xmath16 . as was the case for tres-4 @xcite ,",
    "the internal errors are larger than some other cases of spectra with a similar snr due to the star s broad absorption features . the observed rvs and internal errors are given in table  1 .",
    "we note that we adopt bjd@xmath24 , the barycentric julian date in the barycentric dynamical time standard , for all time stamps in this letter , as advocated by @xcite .",
    "first we fitted the flwo transit light curves in order to determine appropriate data weights for our subsequent analysis , and to refine the transit ephemeris of xo-4b .",
    "we used the analytic formula for transit light curves given by @xcite .",
    "the free parameters were the midtransit time @xmath1 for each transit , the ratio of radii of the planet and star @xmath25 , the orbital inclination @xmath26 , and the orbital distance in units of the stellar radius @xmath27 .",
    "we here adopted the orbital period @xmath28 days , the origin of mid - transit time of xo-4b @xmath29 in bjd@xmath24 , the stellar mass @xmath30  @xmath31 reported by mc08 .",
    "we held fixed one of quadratic limb - darkening coefficients @xmath32 at the value 0.13 , based on tables of , and allowed @xmath33 to be a free parameter .",
    "we determined the optimal parameter values by minimizing the @xmath34 statistic , @xmath35 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the amoeba algorithm @xcite . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath36 are the relative flux data points , and @xmath37 are the values calculated based on the analytic formulae and a particular choice of model parameters .",
    "we then computed the residuals for each dataset , and averaged the residuals into @xmath38 bins of @xmath39 points .",
    "we calculated the standard deviation of the binned data , @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the standard deviation of the residuals for each dataset . to account for increased uncertainties due to time - correlated noise ( so - called red noise ; see e.g. , ) , we computed a red noise factor @xmath43 for various @xmath39 ( corresponding to 10 - 20 min ) , and multiplied the photometric uncertainties of each dataset by the maximum value of @xmath44 .",
    "we estimated 1@xmath45 uncertainties of free parameters based on the criterion @xmath46 .",
    "table  2 summarizes the rms , the red noise factor , and the mid - transit time of each transit light curve .",
    "one important result is that @xmath47 is allowed within the 1@xmath45 level .",
    "this was problematic for subsequent rm modeling , because the two key parameters describing the rm effect ( @xmath5 and @xmath48 , see below ) are strongly degenerate when @xmath49 .",
    "we then fitted all the observed mid - transit times with a linear function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an integer , in order to refine the orbital period of xo-4b .",
    "we note that we added 0.00075 to the value of @xmath52 reported by mc08 to convert the time standard from hjd@xmath53 ( the heliocentric julian date in the coordinated universal time ) to bjd@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the refined transit ephemeris for xo-4b is @xmath54 days and @xmath55 in the bjd@xmath24 system .",
    "we note that the linear fit gave @xmath56 and all o - c residuals were within 1.5@xmath45 uncertainties of @xmath57 . the uncertainty in the predicted time of the transit of ut 2010 january 15 ( the night of our rm measurement ) is about 1  min , which is small enough to be of no concern for our rm modeling .      to describe the rm effect of xo-4b , we derived a formula based on the procedure described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we assumed a rotational broadening kernel of @xmath58  km  s@xmath16 ( mc08 ) and the quadratic limb - darkening parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the iodine absorption band based on the tables of .",
    "the derived formula was @xmath61.\\ ] ] in this formula , @xmath62 is the anomalous radial velocity due to the rm effect , @xmath63 is the loss of light , and @xmath64 is the subplanet velocity ( the radial component of the stellar rotation velocity at the position being hidden by the planet ) .    we simultaneously fitted the subaru rvs and the flwo light curves .",
    "we fixed @xmath65 and @xmath52 at the central values reported above .",
    "we did not fit the rvs reported by mc08 because the errors of the mc08 rvs are much larger than those of the subaru rvs .",
    "thus , those data have little impact on the results .",
    "in addition to the free parameters for the photometric data , we added free parameters for the radial velocity semiamplitude @xmath66 , the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis @xmath5 , the sky - projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath48 , and the overall velocity offset of the subaru dataset @xmath67 . note that we fixed the eccentricity @xmath68 to zero , and the argument of periastron @xmath69 was not considered .",
    "( when @xmath68 and @xmath69 were included as free parameters , the eccentricity was found to be consistent with zero within @xmath70 . )",
    "the @xmath34 statistic for the joint fit was @xmath71 ^ 2 & + & \\sum_j \\left [ \\frac{v_{j,{\\rm obs}}-v_{j,{\\rm calc } } } { \\sigma_{j } } \\right]^2   + \\left",
    "[ \\frac{v \\sin i_s - 8.8}{0.5 } \\right]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 were the observed rvs and @xmath73 were rvs calculated based on the keplerian motion and on the rm formula given above .",
    "the last term was an _ a priori _ constraint on @xmath48 to require consistency with the value reported by mc08 within its uncertainty .",
    "this term was necessary to obtain a meaningful conclusion about @xmath5 , as a consequence of the low impact parameter ( near-90@xmath74 inclination ) of the transit ( see subsection  3.1 . ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure  1 shows the rvs around the transit phase , along with the best - fitting model ( the solid line ) . for reference ,",
    "we have also plotted a model rv curve under the assumption of perfect spin - orbit alignment ( @xmath75 , the dotted line ) .",
    "we found small asymmetry of the rm anomaly with respect to the midtransit time , suggesting that the transit is not exactly equatorial and that there is a significant spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "figure  2 plots the full rv dataset in bjd@xmath24 ( left panel ) and in phase ( right panel ) .",
    "no significant long term trend was observed in the residuals .",
    "table  3 summarizes the optimal values and uncertainties for the system parameters . as shown in table  3 , the free parameters other than the rm - related parameters ( @xmath5 and @xmath48 ) are consistent with those reported previously . for the rm - related parameters , we found @xmath4 and @xmath76  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "we also computed the @xmath77 confidence level of @xmath5 by @xmath78 and found @xmath79 .",
    "figure  3 shows a @xmath34 contour map in @xmath5-@xmath48 space .",
    "the solid lines represent contours for @xmath46 , @xmath80 , and @xmath78 from the inside to the outside .",
    "the orbital axis of xo-4b appears to be tilted relative to the rotational axis of xo-4 in sky projection at about the @xmath77 level .",
    "it should be noted that the confidence with which @xmath5 is found to be nonzero depends critically on the _ a priori _ constraint that we applied on @xmath48 .",
    "this is because when the transit impact parameter is small ( or equivalently when the orbital inclination is near 90@xmath74 ) , there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath5 . in such cases ,",
    "the rv data alone are only able to provide good constraints on the quantity @xmath81 , while @xmath82 is poorly constrained .",
    "when we tried the joint fitting without the _ a priori _ constraint , we found @xmath83  km  s@xmath16 , @xmath84  km  s@xmath16 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 at the 1@xmath45 level . in this case the confidence in the spin - orbit misalignment was lowered , and values of @xmath48 differing strongly from that reported by mc08 were allowed within @xmath70 .",
    "as long as the spectroscopic determination of @xmath87 is valid , our result of a strong spin - orbit misalignment is secure .",
    "however , in order to make the result more robust , and less dependent on the spectroscopic determination of @xmath88 , it would be necessary to obtain a more stringent constraint on the inclination @xmath26 .",
    "the most straightforward way to do so would be to obtain a more precise light curve .",
    "it is difficult to observe complete transits from the ground , because of the comparatively long orbital period and long duration of the transits .",
    "however , the system is in the continuous viewing zone of the hubble space telescope ( @xmath89 ) , as noted by mc08 .",
    "a complete transit light curve based on @xmath89 observations is therefore the highest priority for pinning down the spin - orbit angle .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it is interesting that the planetary orbit is highly tilted , given that the orbital eccentricity of xo-4b is consistent with zero at this point in time .",
    "however , the current bounds on the orbital eccentricity are coarse ; improving the determination of this parameter is also a priority for future work .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that hot jupiters around relatively hot ( @xmath17  k ) stars preferentially have tilted orbits . according to the empirical rule , xo-4 , which has an effective temperature of @xmath18  k ( mc08 ) ,",
    "would have a tilted orbit .",
    "our results agree with this prediction .",
    "in addition , @xcite has recently sought evidence for spin - orbit misalignments along the line of sight , based on the comparison of the measured @xmath90 and the plausible range of rotation velocities for a star of the given mass , radius , and age .",
    "he argued that if a value @xmath91 is larger than 2.9 ( a threshold based on the spocs catalog : @xcite ) , the stellar rotational axis is very likely to be inclined with respect to the line of sight . for a transiting planet host , this would imply a spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "( he also found that hot stars were more likely to have high obliquities , although he phrased the correlation in terms of stellar mass rather than effective temperature . ) for xo-4 , the value is @xmath92 , which is only just below the ( somewhat arbitrary ) threshold of 2.9 .",
    "this suggests that xo-4 has a smaller projected rotational velocity than expected , and can be taken as supporting evidence for a spin - orbit misalignment in the xo-4 system .",
    "we conducted photometric transit observations with the flwo 1.2 m telescope , and rv observations ( including an rm measurement ) with the 8.2 m subaru telescope , for the exoplanet xo-4b .",
    "we refined the transit ephemeris for xo-4b based on the new transit light curves , and modeled the rm effect of xo-4b by jointly fitting the photometry and rvs .",
    "in conjunction with the previous spectroscopic estimate of the projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath48 , we found evidence for spin - orbit misalignment in this system . in this case",
    "the rm data do not provide an strong independent constraint on @xmath93 , because of the low impact parameter of the transit . to complement the rm measurement in this system , a more stringent constraint on",
    "the orbital inclination would be useful to break the fitting degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath48 .",
    "the spin - orbit misalignment of xo-4b suggests that this planet migrated through a mechanism that excited its orbital inclination , although the eccentricity of xo-4b seemed to be quite low .",
    "furthermore , the spin - orbit misalignment of xo-4b is consistent with the findings by @xcite and @xcite that hot stars with hot jupiters have high obliquities .",
    "further follow - up observations to determine a more accurate spin - orbit alignment angle in this system would be still interesting .",
