    ", the rest - frame spectral peak energy @xmath0 and the `` bolometric '' isotropic - equivalent @xmath8-ray energy @xmath1 have a strong correlation , i.e. , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0@xmath1 correlation , called the amati correlation , has recently been extended down to lower energies characteristic of xrfs @xcite . since various observed quantities other than the amati correlation",
    "also distribute continuously among grbs , xrrs , and xrfs @xcite , it is strongly suggested that these three classes are related phenomena .    while many different models have been proposed for xrfs ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , we have proposed the `` off - axis model '' @xcite in which xrfs are the usual grb jets viewed from an off - axis viewing angle ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "when the jet is observed off - axis , the emitted photons are out of the beaming cone and less blueshifted than photons emitted along the jet axis , so that the events look like xrfs .",
    "it has been shown that the viewing angle of the jet is the key parameter to understand the various properties of the grbs and that the luminosity - variability / lag / width correlations might be naturally derived in the framework of off - axis models @xcite .    as for the amati correlation , @xcite computed @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the uniform jet model and found that the results are compatible with the observations .",

    "the energy is large due to the emissions from widely distributed segments with similar viewing angles . @xcite",
    "also anticipated that multiple discrete emissions could have the same effect .",
    "the off - axis jet model has recently been improved to include short grbs @xcite as a unified model , where the grb jet is not uniform but made up of multiple subjets or multiple emission patches .",
    "this is an extreme case of an inhomogeneous jet model @xcite .",
    "the crucial parameter is the multiplicity , @xmath11 , of the subjets along the line of sight . if @xmath12 , the burst looks like a long grb , and if @xmath13 the burst looks like a short grb , while if @xmath14 the burst is an off - axis event for all the subjets and looks like an xrf or an xrr .",
    "we also found that the unified model may explain the bimodal distribution of the @xmath7 durations of batse grbs @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we examine @xmath0@xmath1 correlation in the multiple subjet model to show that the unified model is consistent with the observations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : model ] , we describe our multiple subjet model for prompt emissions .",

    "we adopt an instantaneous emission , at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , of an infinitesimally thin shell moving with the lorentz factor @xmath29 .",

    "the observed spectrum of grbs is well approximated by the band spectrum @xcite . in order to have a spectral shape similar to the band spectrum , we adopt the following form of the spectrum in the comoving frame , @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the break frequency and the low- and high- energy photon index , respectively .    as a summary , equations ( [ eq : flux ] ) , ( [ eq : phi ] ) ,",

    "interestingly , we find that the power - law profile with an index of @xmath161 is preferable to the gaussian profile in order to reproduce the ratio of observed event rate of grbs , xrrs , and xrfs , because the solid angle with @xmath160 is small in the gaussian profile .",

    "<S> we perform monte carlo simulations to study @xmath0@xmath1 correlation in the context of a multiple subjet model ( or inhomogeneous jet model ) for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , x - ray  rich grbs ( xrrs ) , and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) . for a single subjet , we find that @xmath2 for large viewing angles . for the multiple subjet model in which all the subjets have the same intrinsic properties , off - axis events show @xmath3 with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if the intrinsic properties of the subjets are distributed so that on - axis emission of each subjet follows a correlation @xmath5 , we obtain the amati correlation ( @xmath6 ) over three orders of magnitude in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although the scatter around the amati correlation is large in the simulation , the results are consistent with the observed properties of grbs with known redshifts and the baste grbs with pseudo redshifts derived from the lag - luminosity correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the event rates , the redshift distributions , and the @xmath7 duration distributions of grbs , xrrs , and xrfs which can be detected by _ </S>",
    "<S> hete-2 _ , assuming that the source redshift distribution is in proportion to the cosmic star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the event rates of three classes are comparable , that the average redshift of the xrrs is a little larger than those of the grbs and the xrfs , and that short xrrs arise when a single subjet is viewed off - axis or viewed on - axis with slightly high redshift . </S>"
