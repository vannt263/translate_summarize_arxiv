    "the joint analysis of surface brightness profiles and rotation curves has traditionally yielded rich insights into the physics of disc galaxies .",
    "surface brightness profiles allow for bulge - disc decomposition , while extended rotation curves constrain mass models @xcite . however , mass models are subject to degeneracies due , in part , to uncertainties in the mass - to - light ( @xmath2 ) ratios of the baryonic components ( e.g. , maller et al .",
    "2000 , dutton et al . 2005 ) . breaking these degeneracies",
    "requires more data , such as a line of sight ( los ) velocity dispersion profile or a colour profile .",
    "additional data of this type allows for the creation of dynamical models @xcite .",
    "dynamical models , in turn , provide the initial conditions for @xmath4body simulations , which are needed to study the growth of bar and spiral instabilities .",
    "in addition , non - circular motions complicate the interpretation of gas rotation curves @xcite .",
    "stellar rotation curve data may therefore help address these complications .",
    "a data set that includes surface brightness profiles , gas and stellar rotation curves and stellar velocity dispersions can provide constraints on fundamental galaxy parameters , along with information about stability to bar formation in the disc .",
    "such a data set exists for the isolated dwarf sc galaxy ngc 6503 .",
    "gas and stellar rotation curves were measured by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter b89 ) ; b89 also measured the stellar velocity dispersion profile and surface brightness profiles in the @xmath5 and @xmath6bands .",
    "there are no strong asymmetries in galaxy structure ( such as a bar ) , so it is a good candidate for analytic axisymmetric models .",
    "however , further investigation reveals several peculiarities . the galaxy possesses a sharp drop in velocity dispersion near the centre ( known as a ` @xmath0drop ' ) .",
    "the gas and stellar rotation curves are nearly coincident despite the standard asymmetric drift formula s prediction that stars should noticeably lag behind the gas .",
    "finally , the surface brightness profile displays four distinct regions : a central peak , a flat region indicating a freeman ( 1970 ) type ii profile , an inner exponential of scale length @xmath7 kpc and a shallower outer exponential .    in this paper , we present several scenarios corresponding to differing interpretations of the data .",
    "for each scenario , we construct dynamical models that reproduce these features .",
    "we decompose the surface brightness using a srsic bulge and an inner - truncated light profile of the type used by @xcite .",
    "inner truncated disc profiles may be due to dust extinction against an exponential disc @xcite ; they may be intrinsic to the density profile ; or they may be due to a ring of bright stars which does not trace the mass .",
    "we explore these possibilities by testing models numerically under each scenario for bar formation .",
    "the coincidence of gas and stellar rotation curves also deserves attention as it suggests far less asymmetric drift than predicted .",
    "thus , we wish to understand whether gas follows circular orbits that trace the gravitational potential , or whether it has its own asymmetric drift .",
    "we investigate this issue by testing two different ways of fitting the rotation curves : by fitting the stellar rotation alone and using the asymmetric drift to calculate the circular velocity ; and by fitting the gas alone assuming it traces the circular velocity .",
    "our aim is to construct dynamical models for each of these scenarios and test them via @xmath4body simulations .",
    "we use the galactics model from widrow et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter wpd ) defined in terms of distribution functions for the disc , bulge and halo .",
    "the halo allows for a cusp or a core , and the bulge follows a srsic ( 1968 ) profile .",
    "the disc surface density profile is exponential with an optional inner truncation .",
    "the large number of parameters makes finding a fit to the data a challenging exercise .",
    "a number of techniques have been developed to determine best - fit parameters in such complex spaces  notably , maximum likelihood techniques which involve minimizing the @xmath8 value .",
    "one promising approach which improves upon the maximum likelihood method employs bayes theorem and a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique to survey the relevant parameter space .",
    "bayes theorem provides a method of determining the posterior probability of a hypothesis based on both the likelihood function _ and _ prior information about the input parameters ; mcmc provides for a way to survey the parameter space . in conjunction ,",
    "the two techniques provide the joint posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the multidimensional parameter space ; the marginal posterior pdf for any parameter ( and hence its formal mean and error bars ) are obtained by marginalizing over nuisance parameters .",
    "this technique yields realistic constraints on the model parameters , including ( but not limited to ) the halo cusp , the disc and bulge @xmath2 ratios , masses for each component , inner truncation parameters , and bulge srsic index .",
    "similar techniques have been used , for example , to determine cosmological parameters @xcite .    in this work",
    "we build dynamical models for ngc 6503 using a bayesian / mcmc method .",
    "we fit several data sets for this galaxy _ simultaneously _ in order to obtain as complete a picture of the galaxy as possible ; however , the lack of a bar provides a further constraint .",
    "therefore , we also obtain the stability parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 for our models .",
    "the @xmath11parameter determines global stability to multi - armed modes @xcite and the @xmath12parameter determines stability locally @xcite . as a purely phenomenological matter , @xmath10 can also determine global stability to bars @xcite .",
    "we test the stability of our models using @xmath4body simulations .",
    "our approach allows us to investigate numerous other properties of the galaxy .",
    "the srsic index is indicative of bulge formation history @xcite .",
    "we also explore the possibility that the bulge is related to luminous nuclear clusters found near the centres of many disc - dominated late - type galaxies , and derive @xmath2 ratios for the disc and bulge .",
    "moreover , we can constrain the cuspiness of the halo .",
    "cosmological simulations consistently demonstrate that halos are expected to have cuspy halos ( e.g. , navarro et al .",
    "1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , but there are considerable difficulties involved in inferring central halo densities from rotation curve measurements @xcite .",
    "for example , gas rotation curve data near the centre of the galaxy may not trace the gravitational potential ; using the stellar rotational velocity , where available , may be a better way to infer the cusp value @xcite .",
    "further , noncircular gas motions at the centre ( as may be caused by a triaxial halo ) may skew the interpretation of the rotation curve , depending on the orientation of the disc @xcite . with both gas and stellar rotation curves , ngc 6503",
    "provides an excellent opportunity to investigate these issues .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we detail the observational properties of ngc 6503 and elaborate on the peculiarities outlined above . in ",
    "3 we discuss our dynamical models , and in  4 we describe our application of the bayes / mcmc method .",
    "we discuss our primary stability results in  5 , in the process constraining the available physics , and we present additional results in  6 .",
    "section 7 is the discussion , which includes an exposition of prior research on ngc 6503 .",
    "ngc 6503 is an isolated dwarf sc galaxy at a distance of 5.2 mpc @xcite and is inclined at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it displays a small , bright central bulge , no signs of strong asymmetric central structure ( e.g. , no obvious bar ) apart from some spirality , and it is mostly free of gas . in this section",
    "we review existing photometric and kinematic observations of the galaxy . throughout this paper , we use a distance at 5.2 mpc and therefore @xmath14  kpc  @xmath15 at this distance .",
    "photometric imaging by b89 provides azimuthally averaged surface brightness ( sb ) profiles in the @xmath5 and @xmath6bands , both of which display a sharp rise within 50 pc and a freeman ( 1970 ) type ii hump between 50 pc and @xmath16 kpc .",
    "the sb profile is exponential beyond that .",
    "the central flattening is accompanied by a slight reddening in the @xmath17 profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sbdata ] ) .",
    "a circumnuclear h@xmath18 ring is observed at @xmath19 kpc , indicating a star - forming region @xcite .",
    "the outer exponential is remarkably straight in spite of the large error bars ; a linear fit to those points yields a photometric scale length @xmath20 of @xmath21 kpc , which becomes about 1.3 kpc when corrected for inclination and scale height .",
    "[ fig : sbloglog ] shows the @xmath22-@xmath23 plot of the surface brightness .",
    "the inner few points are almost straight , approaching a line with a slope @xmath24 , suggesting a srsic index of 1 .",
    "there are three possibilities for the origin of type ii profiles : first , they may be caused by dust extinction ; second , they may reflect the formation of bright stars that do not trace the mass ; and third , they may be intrinsic to the mass distribution of the disc . in ngc 6503 , the reddening in the inner portion may support the dust extinction hypothesis ( bottema & gerritsen 1997 , hereafter bg97 ) .",
    "bg97 adopt an exponential disc and assume that the flattening in the surface brightness is due to dust ( we return to this work in  7.1 ) . the possibility that dust extinction causes type ii profiles",
    "is also discussed by @xcite for their sample of spiral galaxies with optical and ir imaging ; these authors are unable to reliably distinguish between type i and type ii profiles on the basis of dust extinction , however .",
    "the second possibility relates to bar formation . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that many galaxies with type ii profiles can be fit using kormendy s ( 1977 ) inner truncated profile @xmath25 \\label{eq : kormendy}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a turnover radius and @xmath18 is a cutoff index .",
    "most of baggett et al.s ( 1998 ) galaxies have a bar , but a significant minority do not .",
    "these authors also argue that such flattening is intrinsic to the galaxy rather than being caused by dust .",
    "it is known that bars can induce ring formation in galaxies , which may contribute to the type ii profile flattening , and that circumnuclear rings correlate strongly with barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , simulations by @xcite suggest that the sb flattening could also be caused by the presence of a central bar , as the resulting reorganization of light can flatten the sb profile over the bar s extent . furthermore , while ngc 6503 does not appear to have a bar , it is possible for bars to dissolve by gas inflow , which transfers angular momentum from the gas to the bar @xcite .",
    "the ring currently seen in ngc 6503 may therefore be a relic of a now dissolved bar . in a scenario of ring formation by bar destruction ,",
    "the outer exponential represents the ` true ' disc , and the type ii hump is mainly due to the formation of bright stars that do not trace the mass .",
    "the results in @xcite suggest that the type ii profile could be reproduced by the emergence of a bar in a disc of scale length 1.3 kpc .",
    "therefore , it is incumbent to investigate the sb profile by fitting only the points exterior to 2 kpc .",
    "a third possibility is that type ii profiles are caused by a genuine mass deficit in the inner region , and therefore we also fit the full sb profile directly by assuming an inner truncated disc @xcite .",
    "this naturally produces a better fit to the hump than to the outer points ; along with the first scenario , this scenario provides a direct comparison with the modelling of bg97 , who did not account for the outer exponential .",
    "several rotation curves for ngc 6503 have been measured .",
    "observations by @xcite reveal a remarkably flat rotation curve between 3 kpc and 20 kpc deviating by no more than @xmath27% , and a maximum circular velocity of @xmath28 km s@xmath29 .",
    "@xcite find a similar curve in addition to evidence for a thick and thin disc in ngc 6503 .",
    "the thick disc appears to rotate more slowly than the thin disc and the former does not extend beyond the optical radius .",
    "however , this distinction does not affect begeman s measurements of the total rotation curve .",
    "b89 maps the inner rotation curve with h@xmath30 and emission as well as the stellar features , while @xcite supply h@xmath18 data .",
    "where they overlap , all data sets are in agreement ; the observations appear to be slightly but systematically larger than the h@xmath30 .",
    "the stellar rotation curve largely coincides with the h@xmath30 and curves , with an average difference of only @xmath31 km s@xmath29 . at about 1.5 kpc , the stellar rotation exceeds the gas rotation , possibly owing to the effect of a spiral arm . for our models ,",
    "we fit the , h@xmath30 and stellar data sets .",
    "these are found in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrotationdata ] , along with fits based on the fitting formula @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an asymptotic velocity , @xmath34 is a projected length scale and @xmath35 is a shape parameter governing the sharpness of the ` turnover ' to the asymptotic velocity .",
    "the fit suggests a projected asymptotic circular velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath29 and shows how close the two rotation curves are .",
    "the coincidence of the stellar and gas rotation curves must be accounted for .",
    "if the gas rotation traces the gravitational potential , the difference between the two rotation curves yields a measure of the asymmetric drift , @xmath37 .",
    "the latter , defined as the difference between the circular velocity @xmath38 calculated from the potential and the streaming velocity @xmath39 of the stars , is given by @xmath40   \\label{eq : vasym}\\ ] ] for an exponential disc , where @xmath20 is the disc scale length and @xmath41 is the radial velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "when applied to the observed h@xmath30 rotation curve , eq .",
    "[ eq : vasym ] yields an asymmetric drift of order of @xmath42 km s@xmath29 , depending on the adopted central radial dispersion .",
    "km s@xmath29 , which is much lower than our calculated values .",
    "we have been unable to reproduce this number ; every permutation of scalelength and dispersion that we tried in eq .",
    "[ eq : vasym ] yields asymmetric drifts of at least @xmath435 km s@xmath29 . ]",
    "the asymmetric drift is much larger than the observed difference between the gas and stellar curves ; a possible cause of the discrepancy is that gas does not trace the gravitational potential .",
    "traditionally , gas is assumed to travel on circular orbits , so that the h@xmath30/ rotation curves would trace the gravitational potential in this galaxy .",
    "the assumption of circularity in gas rotation curves underlies much of the work on mass modelling in the literature . however , it is not possible for this assumption to strictly hold because gas dispersion is non - zero .",
    "there are several sources of this dispersion including turbulence caused by supernova feedback and the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - circular motions can impact the gas rotation curves of disc galaxies ( e.g. , hayashi et al . 2004 , valenzuela et al . 2007 ) , thereby reducing the observed velocity relative to the actual circular velocity .",
    "being collisionless , our models can not capture these effects ; therefore , the hypothesis that the gas rotation traces the circular velocity can only be tested using the gravitational potential of our models .",
    "however , the stellar asymmetric drift can easily be modeled to obtain a separate value for the circular velocity .",
    "the stellar asymmetric drift is itself subject to several caveats ; it is , for example , highly sensitive to the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "these issues are addressed in  7.3 .      the los velocity dispersion profile for ngc 6503 from b89 is found in fig .  [ fig : dispdata ] .",
    "there is a @xmath44-drop within 300 pc and an exponential decline beyond that range .",
    "we fit the data to an outer exponential with an inverse gaussian in the centre : @xmath45   \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the extrapolated central dispersion @xmath48 and the projected scale length @xmath49 are the fitting parameters .",
    "the fit yields @xmath50 kpc and @xmath51 km s@xmath29 , which will provide a point of comparison for our results in  6 .",
    "note that we do not attempt to model the physical processes which may be responsible for the @xmath0drop , but we do determine structural parameters and effective @xmath2 ratios for the bulge to account for the @xmath0drop .",
    "ngc 6503 was the first galaxy shown to have a @xmath0drop .",
    "a growing body of data suggests that @xmath0drops are found in numerous spiral galaxies @xcite , although @xcite argue that some @xmath0drops are observational artifacts .",
    "bg97 suggest that the @xmath0drop is due to a small central , possibly star forming component capable of continually cooling the centre .",
    "a physical explanation for @xmath0drops is proposed by @xcite and @xcite , who argue that the presence of dynamically cold gas funnelling into the centre is responsible for forming dynamically cold stars that dominate the observed los kinematics .",
    "@xcite s sample of @xmath0drop galaxies correlates with higher incidences of nuclear dust spirals , h@xmath18 rings and seyfert fraction , which would be consistent with a cold star - forming component in the centre due to gas inflow .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite suggest that inner nuclear bars may be responsible for at least some of the @xmath0drops found in the literature .",
    "we test three different ways to fit the sb profile : ( i ) assuming an inner truncated disc ; ( ii ) assuming an exponential disc with an inner truncated light profile to model simply the effect of dust extinction ( a full dust model is outside the scope of this work ) ; and ( iii ) fitting only the inner ( @xmath52 kpc ) and outer ( @xmath53 kpc ) points to account for the true disc being external to the type ii hump .",
    "furthermore , we test two ways to model the rotation : ( i ) we fit the gas rotation by assuming that it equals the circular velocity ; and ( ii ) we fit the stellar rotation by simulating the los observations of the inclined disc .",
    "simulating observations along a line of sight is particularly important for stellar kinematic measurements because of the non - negligible scale height of the stellar disc , which leads to integration effects as the line of sight passes through regions of the disc that are not in the plane .",
    "this effect is less important for the gas disc , which is expected to have a small scale height .",
    "these tests are accounted for by four different scenarios . in scenario",
    "k ( for kormendy ) , we fit the full surface brightness with an inner truncated kormendy disc , and we fit the stellar rotation curve . in kl ( kormendy light ) , we fit the surface brightness using an inner truncated light profile atop an exponential disc to account for dust extinction , and fit the stellar rotation as in scenario k. in scenario kg ( kormendy gas ) , we fit the surface brightness as in k but fit the gas rotation by assuming that the gas travels on circular orbits , ignoring the stellar rotation data .",
    "finally , in scenario e ( exponential ) , we fit the surface brightness excluding the points that constitute the type ii hump , and fit the stellar kinematic data as in k. scenario e therefore alleviates the need for an inner truncated disc . in all cases ,",
    "we fit the los velocity dispersion and the data outside 3 kpc .",
    "these models and the fitting procedures are described in more detail in  4 and 5 ; we first briefly discuss the galactics model and the mcmc technique .",
    "our goal is to construct a self - consistent equilibrium dynamical model for ngc 6503 .",
    "dynamical modelling yields the phase space distribution function ( df ) for a system that precisely specifies its densities and velocities _ simultaneously _ ; for self - consistency and equilibrium , the model must satisfy both the poisson and time - independent collisionless boltzmann equations .",
    "the galactics model of widrow et al .",

    "a characteristic velocity scale @xmath72 is introduced according to @xmath73 .",
    "for practical purposes , the density profile is truncated using an error function ( wpd ) .",
    "we allow @xmath69 to vary for maximum flexibility in fitting the observed data , since simulations of halo formation suggest that cusp values other than 1 may be appropriate @xcite and that halo profiles may not be universal @xcite .",
    "surface brightness profiles in discs tend to decline exponentially with radius .",
    "assuming light traces mass , this implies that the surface density is exponential : @xmath74 where @xmath20 is the photometric scale length .",

    "[ eq : radsigma ] includes a parameter to control the scale length of the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "although observations by @xcite suggest that @xmath90 , there is no clear theoretical reason why this should necessarily be the case .",
    "here we treat @xmath20 and @xmath49 independently to provide maximum flexibility in fitting all data sets .",
    "the galactics model , modified to include inner truncation , has two further parameters for the disc ; the turnover radius @xmath26 and the cutoff index @xmath18 .",
    "we complete the parameter input set with @xmath6band @xmath2 ratios for the bulge and disc .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2 ratios are constant with radius , and use the same value for the surface brightness and the stellar kinematic fits .",
    "although the band pass over which the stellar observations were taken are not identical to the @xmath6band , we do not expect the error introduced by this simplification to be significant .    thus the parameters that we modify are : the five halo parameters ; the exponential disc mass , scale height , scale length , and two kormendy parameters ; all bulge parameters ; the central radial dispersion and dispersion profile scale length ; and the disc and bulge @xmath2 ratios .",
    "in addition , each data set has an associated noise parameter that is allowed to vary ( see  4 ) .",
    "we assume the halo to be nonrotating and truncate the disc at 5 kpc ( well outside the measured data ) . the galaxy inclination @xmath91 is also fixed at 74@xmath92 . a list of the relevant parameters that are fit , as well as calculated output quantities , is presented in table 1 .",
    "the units used by galactics are such that @xmath93 , but the masses have been converted back to @xmath94 for simplicity .",
    "the core idea of this study is to derive the joint posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the galaxy parameters using bayes theorem and mcmc .",
    "bayes theorem provides a way to infer the posterior probability of a hypothesis , given some kind of evidence ( such as observational data ) , using the prior probabilities of the evidence and model and a likelihood function ( such as a @xmath8 function ) .",
    "the joint posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the model parameters is written as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the set of model input parameters and @xmath97 is the set of observational data .",

    "mcmc , in turn , provides a method of surveying the parameter space that rapidly converges to the posterior probability distribution of the input parameters .",
    "our mcmc technique explores the parameter space by way of the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "essentially , a random walk is constructed in parameter space by sampling a new set of model parameters @xmath102 at each step of the chain , and @xmath103 is calculated using the likelihood function and the priors .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 is then calculated .",
    "if @xmath105 , @xmath102 is accepted ; otherwise , @xmath102 is accepted or rejected with a uniform random probability @xmath106 . over the course of many such iterations , the chain populates the posterior pdfs , in the process supplying the pdfs for each parameter by marginalizing over the full pdf .",
    "initially , the chain quickly travels to regions of ` good ' fits from any set of initial parameters , and eventually settles into the best fit region , a process known as ` burn - in ' .",
    "it can be proven that the resulting density of points in parameter space samples the real probability density distribution of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "we aim towards an acceptance rate of 23% in our chains @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the technique may be found in @xcite .",
    "the benefits of mcmc are numerous : it fully samples the pdfs for all fitted parameters , meaning that formal errors and error contours are easily determined ; it is easily extended to include more parameters if desired ; it tends to move to a region of high likelihood fairly rapidly ; other quantities , such as the stability parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , are easily calculated from the pdfs ; and there is some evidence that it provides more realistic error constraints than maximum likelihood methods @xcite .",
    "the primary disadvantages are twofold .",
    "first , there is no guarantee of uniqueness to the final solutions  multimodal pdfs are possible in any given parameter space .",
    "however , a judicious choice of the step size and proper tweaking to obtain the correct acceptance rate mitigates this problem .",
    "second , although mcmc chains tend to converge quickly , it is not so simple to verify that the converged chains have fully populated the joint posterior pdf .",
    "moreover , the chain may ` spread around ' the parameter space , reflecting either the real structure of the joint pdf or the fact that the chain has not run long enough to fully populate the pdf . formally ensuring convergence may require prohibitively long computing time .",
    "however , in practice we are able to obtain good constraints for most parameters in a reasonable time .",
    "this does not preclude the possibility that a mcmc chain passed through multiple pdf peaks after burn - in , but there would be no reason to prefer any one such peak over another .",

    "in addition , we find a statistically significant difference in cusp values depending on which rotation curve is fit , but both cases are consistent with or cuspier than cosmological simulations .",

    "moreover , as noted in  2.2 , the rotation is systematically larger than the h@xmath30 rotation , which suggests that the h@xmath30 rotation is more affected by these issues .",
    "recent simulations suggest that halo cusps are slightly shallower than previously inferred , with @xmath180 @xcite .",

    "bg97 dropped this factor for the models discussed in that paper and used the isolated disc dispersions ( bottema , private communication ) . ]",

    "thus , their @xmath138 data points are consistent with our @xmath138 pdf . however , their discs do not display bar formation , while ours do ; there are two possible reasons for this .",
    "first , from fig .",
    "[ fig : kormendyall - bar ] , most of our models only develop a bar after @xmath210 gyr , while bg97 evolved their simulations for @xmath211 gyr . second , and more importantly , it is now known that live halos can trigger bar formation @xcite ; bg97 used rigid halo potentials for their simulations , so this bar formation trigger is not in play .",
    "we evolved one of our bar unstable models in exactly the way described in  5 , except the number of disc particles was reduced to 40k .",
    "we found that the bar formation in this model was delayed by @xmath212 gyr , suggesting that sufficient numerical resolution is needed to capture the correct evolution .",
    "this is consistent with halo - triggered bar formation , because inadequate numerical resolution will fail to resolve the resonant interactions required for this mechanism .",
    "the ratio @xmath213 is an observation of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "should this ratio hold at all radii in a general disc galaxy ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that the ratio is closer to 0.7 for ngc 488 and to 0.85 for ngc 2985 , and @xcite find that the ratio is also high for ngc 3949 and ngc 3982 ( the latter s vertical dispersion is larger than its radial dispersion ) .",
    "theoretical studies of the dispersion ratio have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , who find that @xmath214 is roughly correct provided that @xmath215 ; higher values of @xmath216 imply higher @xmath200 values .",
    "this condition is probably satisfied in the centres of galaxies , and it would therefore be unreasonable to extend a fixed ratio of velocity dispersions across the entire disc .",
    "in fact , one might surmise that the reason for the central outflow in bg97 s heavier discs is the incorrect ratio of velocity dispersions there .    to examine the velocity dispersion ratio for ngc 6503",
    ", we took the fiducial best fit model for ngc 6503 ( that is , the means from table  [ table : resultsall ] ) and all models used to test bar stability and calculated the ratio as a function of radius .",
    "the results are found in fig .  [",
    "fig : dispersionratio ] .",
    "ngc 6503 s dispersion ratio depends critically on the assumed model ",
    "scenario k exhibits a nearly linear decline with radius in which @xmath217 within two disc scale lengths .",
    "there is no indication of flattening that would justify adopting a single value over the entire disc , and very little scatter .",
    "scenarios e , kl and kg display considerably more scatter , although only scenario kg displays anything close to a relatively constant ratio of 0.6 over a significant range ; models from scenario kg appear to converge to @xmath218 at small radii , but the scatter increases at larger radii .",
    "the shape and slope of the curve is critically dependent on the choice of @xmath20 and @xmath49 ; in scenario k , @xmath219 , which drags down the dispersion ratio at outer radii . if we set @xmath49 to be 50% of the fiducial value , the ratio would fall less rapidly with radius but would still not be constant .",
    "note that when @xmath220 the ratio is constant by eqs .",
    "[ eq : iso ] and [ eq : iso2 ] , although this may not hold in an embedded disc .",
    "overall , we find that a constant dispersion ratio does not apply for this galaxy .",
    "the issues of cusps , asymmetric drift and stability are intertwined because all hinge on the reliability of rotation curve data and all depend on a full accounting of effects that alter the interpretation of the rotation curve .",
    "as already indicated , it is inappropriate to assume that the gas rotation traces the gravitational potential , implying that : ( 1 ) the difference between the gas and stellar rotation curves is not a measure of the asymmetric drift ; ( 2 ) the gas rotation can not be used to assess the cusp value ; and ( 3 ) the proper choice of rotation curve to model is critical to finding the correct stability region .",
    "as noted in  2.2 , the theoretical asymmetric drift ( eq .  [ eq : vasym ] ) is much larger than the difference between the gas and stellar rotation curves .",
    "we have conducted separate mcmc runs in which we fit both the gas rotation curve as a tracer of the circular velocity _ and _ the stellar velocity .",
    "this only yields models with @xmath131 , because of the very low asymmetric drift implied by the nearly coincident rotation curves .",
    "such models , when simulated , display sharp instabilities including disc fragmentation and can not reproduce the observed properties of the galaxy . our preference for fitting the stellar rotation curve and finding that gas can not be assumed to trace to circular velocity is corroborated by @xcite .",
    "they analyse rotation curves of lsb galaxies and find that stellar rotation curves are much more regular and amenable to modelling than gas curves , which suffer from numerous issues including noncircular and vertical motions that affect their speeds relative to the circular velocity .",
    "the impact on the cusp value is notable because , if gas does not trace the gravitational potential , the circular velocity is steeper in the centre than the slope of the gas rotation . assuming that the gas traces the gravitational potential will therefore lower the inferred cusp value .",
    "this is a possible source of error in early work assessing the observed cusp value in lsb galaxies , as small changes in central slope can lead to large changes in the cusp value or possibly imply a cored halo ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we avoid this problem by using a model that follows the stellar kinematics with asymmetric drift incorporated self - consistently .",
    "once the gas asymmetric drift is properly accounted for by including a full treatment of noncircular motions and turbulence , gas rotation curves should be as reliable as stellar rotation curves .",
    "detailed measurements of the dispersion in spiral galaxies are becoming more common and will aid the modelling of gas kinematics .",
    "for example , @xcite obtain the high resolution velocity map for ngc 6946 , finding dispersions of @xmath221 km s@xmath29 , high velocity clumps that lag the disc rotation , and hundreds of `` holes '' in the distribution which are likely due to star formation .",
    "we surmise that modelling these phenomena and determining the impact on derived galaxy parameters is a nontrivial exercise .",
    "however , while easier to model than the gas asymmetric drift , the stellar asymmetric drift is also subject to several complications , a few of which we now address .",
    "[ eq : vasym ] is derived assuming an exponential disc , cylindrical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid and @xmath220 . with an inner truncated disc and @xmath222 ,",
    "the asymmetric drift becomes @xmath223 .",
    "\\label{eq : vasym1}\\ ] ] if we now assume that the velocity ellipsoid is spherically aligned , we obtain @xmath224 .",
    "\\label{eq : vasym2}\\ ] ] this expression will match eq .",
    "[ eq : vasym1 ] only if @xmath225 , which is not generally the case (  7.2 ) .",
    "both expressions reduce the asymmetric drift relative to what eq .",
    "[ eq : vasym ] predicts ; in particular , the addition of an inner truncation reduces the expected drift significantly in the inner parts .",
    "the size of the change is only a few km s@xmath29 , but it is still a significant fraction of the predicted drift .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vasym ] , in which the effects of adding an inner truncation and spherical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid are examined .",
    "it is noteworthy that the inner truncation can effectively wipe out the asymmetric drift over a large range in radius ; a similar effect is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kormendy - model ] . for fig .",
    "[ fig : vasym ] , we use the fiducial values for scenario k found in table  [ table : resultsall ] .",
    "note that the increased asymmetric drifts at larger radii are due to the large @xmath49 of this scenario , and the asymmetric drift expression breaks down inside @xmath226 .",
    "we test cases in which @xmath49 is reduced to 50% of the fiducial value and find that the asymmetric drift is reduced in the outer part .",
    "thus , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : vasym ] , a combination of factors can serve to reduce the asymmetric drift nearly to the observed values in this galaxy .",
    "one should keep in mind that the sensitivity of the asymmetric drift expression to such changes means that the predicted drifts may fluctuate wildly depending on the assumptions .",
    "because of these issues , the circular velocity derived in scenarios k , kl and e may be larger than the true circular velocity . these caveats further suggest that the asymmetric drift found in scenario kg may be smaller than seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : kormendy - model ] , and hence that scenario kg may be potentially viable . without more information about the asymmetric drift in real galaxies ,",
    "it is impossible to claim that scenario kg is definitely unrealistic ; however , scenarios k and e remain our preferred models for this galaxy .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggests that ngc 6503 may possess a nuclear disc of radius @xmath171 pc and an end - on bar ; deprojection of their @xmath227band image of ngc 6503 shows a bar like structure perpendicular to the major axis with clear spiral arms emanating from the ends .",
    "this scenario is consistent with our scenario e. it would moreover explain the @xmath0drop because of star formation at the centre caused by bar induced gas inflow and because diagnostics from @xcite suggest that end - on bars may generate @xmath0drops .",
    "these findings are compelling evidence for a bar in ngc 6503 .",
    "notably , these authors also estimate the age of the star formation ring at @xmath228 gyr , which is well below the timescale for bar destruction determined by @xcite of @xmath7 gyr .",
    "the presence of a bar in ngc 6503 is unlikely to change our main conclusions because it is end on .",
    "there is no clear kinematic indicator of bar structure in the stellar or ionized gas rotation curve ; we expect that the measured values are largely unaffected by the bar since only a small region of the slit used for observation would have intersected the bar .",
    "part of the @xmath0drop could be due to the bar , and thus the bulge may not be as large and have as low a density as found in  6.2 .",
    "other bulge parameters are less likely to be affected by the bar ; in particular , the conclusion that there is a star forming component in the galaxy centre is unchanged .",
    "we have deployed a bayesian / markov chain monte carlo technique to model the disc galaxy ngc 6503 . we find models for ngc 6503 that satisfy the observational constraints using this technique , and are able to constrain the input parameters .",
    "the data includes a freeman type ii surface brightness profile , ionized gas and rotation curves , the stellar rotation curve and the stellar line of sight velocity dispersion .",
    "four different scenarios were considered : an inner truncated disc , an exponential disc with dust , a model in which gas traces the gravitational potential , and a model in which the true underlying disc scale length is revealed in the outermost portion of the surface brightness profile .",
    "we find that the second scenario leads to models that strongly bar unstable , and the third scenario can not reproduce the stellar rotation curve .",
    "the first scenario provides the best fit to the data and is most likely to offer the bar stability required to correctly model the galaxy , but the last scenario also provides a realistic model for the galaxy .",
    "further properties of the galaxy are discerned ; the bulge is a pseudobulge , and the bulge @xmath2 is lower than the disc @xmath2 , suggesting a star forming component that is probably responsible for the @xmath0drop .",
    "we also find that the halo must be cusped with @xmath229 , a result that is robust to all fitting methods .",
    "the bayesian / mcmc technique used to discover these results is robust and flexible ; we find it to be an effective tool for fitting galaxy models in complex parameter spaces .",

    "<S> we examine several interpretations of the data : the type ii surface brightness profile may be due to dust extinction , to an inner truncated disc or to a ring of bright stars ; and we test separate fits to the gas and stellar rotation curves to determine if the gas traces the gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> we test each of these scenarios for bar stability , ruling out dust extinction . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the gas likely does not trace the gravitational potential , since the predicted stellar rotation curve , which includes asymmetric drift , is then inconsistent with the observed stellar rotation curve . </S>",
    "<S> the disc is well fit by an inner - truncated profile , but the possibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the type ii profile is also a realistic model . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with @xmath1 ; the bulge has a lower @xmath2 than the disc , suggesting a star forming component in the centre of the galaxy ; and the bulge , as expected for this late type galaxy , has a low srsic index with @xmath3 , suggesting a formation history dominated by secular evolution . </S>"
