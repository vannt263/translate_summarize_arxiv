    "the negative-@xmath11 centers ( nuc ) conception is a way to describe and understand properties of high - temperature cuprate superconductors @xcite .",

    "anderson @xcite ( fig.1 ) and the results of kulik and pedan @xcite .",
    "it is described by hubbard hamiltonian with a negative correlation energy @xcite . in terms of this approach ,",
    "we have obtained dome - shaped dependence of the critical temperature of the superconducting transition , @xmath15 , on the doping level @xcite and calculated nonmonotonic @xmath0-dependences of the normal - phase hall coefficient for ybco and lsco @xcite .",
    "assuming that the electric field is directed along the @xmath16 axis , in order to obtain the @xmath0-dependence of the conductivity we solve the kinetic boltzmann equation for holes in the @xmath7-approximation . in the case of the hole parabolic dispersion relation ,",

    "free model parameters were nuc concentration @xmath27 , @xmath9 and @xmath28 ( distance between the valence band top and the fermi level , see fig.1 ) @xcite . in accord with known @xmath29 @xcite , scattering owing to acoustic phonons",
    "@xcite was considered    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the mass of a lattice ion , @xmath32 is the electron - phonon interaction constant , @xmath33 is lattice constant , @xmath34 is speed of sound of @xmath10@xmath35@xmath36 cm / s @xcite , @xmath37 is unit cell volume , @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 is the energy .",

    "the fig.3 demonstrates that @xmath1 starts to show the semiconducting behavior at increasingly high temperatures as the fermi level moves into the band gap ( @xmath28 becomes increasingly negative ) . at @xmath40 = 6.35 , this `` switching '' temperature is @xmath10110 k or @xmath109 mev ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , generalizing the parabolic dispersion relation @xmath41 used for the hall and hence for the resistivity calculations to the anisotropic case one can get only corrections in the form of coefficients @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , for the hall coefficient and @xmath45{\\frac{m_c}{m_{ab}}}$ ] for @xmath12 ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , anisotropy of charge carriers dispersion does not introduce change in the @xmath0-run of the resistivity ( and @xmath0-dependence of the hall coefficient as well ) .",
    "for both lsco and ybco , @xmath9 was @xmath1010 - 100 free electron masses .",
    "this mass is mostly of the same anisotropic origin being overestimated , equalled @xmath45{m_{ab}^2\\cdot m_c}$ ] .",
    "the comparison of the calculations results against experimental data suggests that the nuc model consistently describes @xmath0-dependences of the hall coefficient and the resistivity of cuprate htscs in the normal phase plus to correctly calculated @xmath15 values .",
