    "the field of silicon and germanium nanocrystals ( ncs ) is very active due to important technological achievements and prospects particularly in connection with optics such as light emitting diodes and lasers.@xcite two fundamental processes describing the interaction of light with matter are the photon absorption and emission . in the context of ncs , it has been shown both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite that the interface properties have dramatic effects on the emission properties .",
    "on the other hand , absorption measurements are less sensitive to surface quality and allow for a more direct characterization of the intrinsic structure of ncs.@xcite therefore , the study of the direct photon absorption in ncs can provide a clear physical understanding .",
    "moreover , with the ever - growing importance of renewable energy resources , the research on the new - generation photovoltaics has gained momentum and hence the subject of direct photon absorption in nanocrystalline silicon ( @xmath1-si).@xcite however , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically ,  @xcite researchers till now have predominantly focused on the interband absorption process .",
    "this is the only optical absorption possibility for an intrinsic semiconductor nc under equilibrium . by relaxing these two constraints",
    "we can introduce other absorption channels , mainly through carrier injection or optical pumping . the associated absorption in either case is sometimes referred to as `` free '' carrier absorption despite the carrier confinement in ncs . in our work",
    "we discriminate between the two .",
    "the electrical injection or doping gives rise to intraband absorption , also termed as intersubband absorption  @xcite which has practical importance for mid- and near - infrared photodetectors.@xcite the optical pumping which is usually well above the effective band gap leads to excited - state absorption ( also termed as photoinduced absorption ) which is an undesired effect that can inhibit the development of optical gain.@xcite recent experiments on excited - state absorption concluded that more attention should be devoted to the role of the excitation conditions in the quest for the silicon laser.@xcite therefore , the aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive theoretical account of all of these direct photon absorption mechanisms in si and ge ncs under various size , shape and excitation conditions .",
    "this provides a complementary track to the existing experimental efforts where the size and shape control are currently major obstacles .",
    "the absorption coefficient of the semiconductor ncs depends on the product of the optical transition oscillator strength and their joint density of states as well as to their volume filling factor within the matrix . therefore , the essential decision on a theoretical study is the sophistication level of the electronic structure .",
    "the usual trade off between the computational cost and accuracy is operational .",
    "the constraints on the former are quite stringent as a nc including the active region of the matrix surrounding itself can contain on the order of ten thousand atoms . as for",
    "the latter , not only the accuracy but also the validity of a chosen approach can become questionable .",
    "computationally low - cost approaches like the envelope function in conjunction with 8-band * k*@xmath2*p * are not as accurate for this task and furthermore , they miss some critical symmetries of the underlying lattice .",
    "@xcite on the other extreme , there lies the density functional theory - based _ ab initio _ codes  @xcite which have been applied to smaller ncs containing less than 1000 atoms which still require very demanding computational resources",
    ".  @xcite the _ ab initio _ analysis of larger ncs of sizes between 3 - 10  nm is practically not possible with the current computer power . while this technological hurdle will be gradually overcome in the years to come",
    ", there exists other atomistic approaches that can be employed for nc research which can be run on modest platforms and are much simpler to develop , such as the tight binding technique which has been successfully employed by several groups .",
    "@xcite on the pseudopotential - based approaches , two new recipes were proposed by wang and zunger over the last decade .",
    "@xcite the folded spectrum method  @xcite relies on standard plane wave basis and direct diagonalization ; its speed is granted from being focused on relatively few targetted states . for the study of excitons",
    "this approach becomes very suitable whereas for the optical absorption spectra where a large number of states contribute it loses its advantage .",
    "their other recipe is the so - called linear combination of bulk bands ( lcbb ) .",
    "@xcite as a matter of fact , the idea of using bulk bloch states in confined systems goes back to earlier times , one of its first implementations being the studies of ninno _ et al . _",
    "@xcite up to now , it has been used for self - assembled quantum dots ,  @xcite superlattices ,  @xcite and high - electron mobility transistors ,  @xcite and very recently on the @xmath1-si aggregation stages .",
    "@xcite in this work , we apply lcbb to the electronic structure and absorption spectra of si and ge ncs . an important feature of this work , in contrast to commonly studied hydrogen - passivated ncs is that we consider ncs _ embedded _ in a wide band - gap matrix which is usually silica .",
    "@xcite in principle , other matrices such as alumina or silicon nitride can be investigated along the same lines .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  ii we describe the theoretical framework which includes some brief information on the lcbb technique and the absorption expressions .",
    "a self - critique of the theoretical model is done in section  iii .",
    "section  iv presents the results and discussions on the band edge electronic structure , interband , intraband , and excited - state absorptions followed by our conclusions in section  v. appendix section contains technical details on the employed pseudopotential form factors and our lcbb implementation .",
    "for the electronic structure of large - scale atomistic systems wang and zunger have developed the lcbb method which is particularly convenient for embedded ncs containing several thousand atoms .",
    "@xcite the fact that it is a pseudopotential - based method makes it more preferable over the empirical tight binding technique for the study of optical properties as aimed in this work . in this technique the nc wavefunction with a state label @xmath3 is expanded in terms of the bulk bloch bands of the constituent core and/or embedding medium ( matrix ) materials @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of primitive cells within the computational supercell , @xmath6 is the expansion coefficient set to be determined and @xmath7 is the constituent bulk material label pointing to the nc core or embedding medium . @xmath8",
    "is the cell - periodic part of the bloch states which can be expanded in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volume of the primitive cell .",
    "the atomistic hamiltonian for the system is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the weight function that takes values 0 or 1 depending on the type of atom at the position @xmath14 ,  @xcite and @xmath15 is the screened spherical pseudopotential of atom @xmath16 of the material @xmath7 .",
    "we use semiempirical pseudopotentials for si and ge developed particularly for strained si / ge superlattices which reproduces a large variety of measured physical data such as bulk band structures , deformation potentials , electron - phonon matrix elements , and heterostructure valence band offsets .",
    "@xcite with such a choice , this approach benefits from the empirical pseudopotential method ( epm ) , which in addition to its simplicity has another advantage over the more accurate density functional _ ab initio _ techniques that run into well - known band - gap problem  @xcite which is a disadvantage for the correct prediction of the excitation energies .",
    "the formulation can be cast into the following generalized eigenvalue equation :  @xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 here , the atoms are on regular sites of the underlying bravais lattice : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are its direct lattice vectors of the bravais lattice .",
    "both the nc and the host matrix are assumed to possess the same lattice constant and the whole structure is within a supercell which imposes the periodicity condition @xmath24 , recalling its fourier representation @xmath25 , implies @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the _ bulk _ material . thus the reciprocal space of the supercell arrangement is not a continuum but is of the grid form composed of points @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",

    "if the nc is surrounded by vacuum , this corresponds to the free - standing case .",
    "however , the dangling bonds of the surface nc atoms lead to quite a large number of interface states which adversely contaminate especially the effective band - gap region of the nc . in practice ncs",
    "are embedded into a wide band - gap host matrix which is usually silica .",
    "@xcite however , the pseudopotential for oxygen is nontrivial in the case of epm  @xcite and furthermore , lattice constant of sio@xmath31 is not matched to either of the core materials introducing strain effects .",
    "therefore , we embed the si and ge ncs into an _ artificial",
    "_ wide band - gap medium which for the former reproduces the proper band alignment of the si / sio@xmath31 system . to circumvent the strain effects which are indeed present in the actual samples , we set the lattice constant and crystal structure of the matrix equal to that of the core material .",
    "the pseudopotential form factors of the wide band - gap matrices for si and ge can easily be produced starting from those of the core materials .",

    "the blue ( dark - colored ) arrow represents optical pumping and following carrier relaxation , the downward green arrow corresponds to luminescence which can be to a final interface state ( dashed line ) .",
    "@xcite for all these processes , the relevant quantity is the imaginary part of the dielectric function . within the independent - particle approximation and the artificial supercell framework",

    "its rate depends on the amount of excited carriers .",
    "therefore , we consider the absorption rate for _ one _ excited electron or hole that lies at an initial state @xmath47 with energy @xmath48 . as there are a number of closely spaced such states",
    ", we perform a boltzmann averaging over these states as @xmath49 .",
    "we further assume that the final states have no occupancy restriction , which can easily be relaxed if needed .",
    "the expression for absorption rate per an excited carrier in each nc becomes @xmath50 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times   \\frac{\\gamma/(2\\pi)}{\\left[e_f - e_i-\\hbar\\omega\\right]^2+(\\gamma/2)^2}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath51 is the light polarization direction .",
    "finally , we include the surface polarization effects , also called local field effects ( lfe ) using a simple semiclassical model which agrees remarkably well with more rigorous treatments .",
    "@xcite we give a brief description of its implementation .",
    "first , using the expression @xmath52 we extract ( i.e. , de - embed ) the size - dependent nc dielectric function , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 corresponds to eq .",
    "[ im_eps ] , suppressing the cartesian indices .",
    "@xmath55 is the dielectric function of the host matrix ; for simplicity we set it to the permittivity value of sio@xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath56 . since the wide band - gap matrix introduces no absorption up to an energy of about 9  ev , we can approximate @xmath57 .",
    "one can similarly obtain the @xmath58 within the random - phase approximation ,  @xcite hence get the full complex dielectric function @xmath53 . according to the classical clausius - mossotti approach , which is shown to work also for ncs ,  @xcite the dielectric function of the nc is modified as @xmath59\\ , , \\ ] ] to account for lfe .",
    "the corresponding supercell dielectric function , @xmath60 follows using eq .  [ mixing ] .",
    "similarly , the intensity absorption coefficients are also modified due to surface polarization effects , cf .",
    "eq .  [ epsalpha ] .",
    "its consequences will be reported in section  iv .",
    "the most crucial simplification of our model is the fact that strain - related effects are avoided , a route which is shared by other theoretical works .",
    "@xcite for large ncs this may not be critical , however , for very small sizes this simplification is questionable .",
    "an important support for our act is that weissker and coworkers have concluded that while there is some shift and possibly a redistribution of oscillator strengths after ionic relaxation , the overall appearance of the absorption spectra does not change strongly .  @xcite we should mention that wang and zunger have offered a recipe for including strain within the lcbb framework , however , this is considerably more involved .",
    "@xcite another widespread simplification on si and ge ncs is the omission of the spin - orbit coupling and the nonlocal ( angular momentum - dependent ) pseudopotential terms in the electronic structure hamiltonian . especially the former is not significant for si which is a light atom but it can have a quantitative impact on the valence states of ge ncs ; such a treatment is available in ref .  .",
    "on the dielectric response , there are much more sophisticated and involved treatments  @xcite whereas ours is equivalent to the independent particle random phase approximation  @xcite of the macroscopic dielectric function with the surface polarization effects included within the classical clausius - mossotti model .",
    "@xcite the contribution of the excluded excitonic and other many - body effects beyond the mean - field level can be assessed _ a posteriori _ by comparing with the available experimental data .",
    "however , it is certain that the precedence should be given to classical electrostatics for properly describing the background dielectric mismatch between the core and the wide band - gap matrix .",
    "@xcite in our treatment this is implemented at an atomistic level .",
    "another effect not accounted in this work is the role of the interface region .",
    "our wide band - gap matrix can reproduce the proper band alignment and dielectric confinement of an sio@xmath31 matrix , however , the interface chemistry such as silicon - oxygen double bonds  @xcite are not represented .",
    "these were shown to be much more effective on the emission spectra .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , our results can be taken as the benchmark for the performance of the atomistic quantum and dielectric confinement with a clean and inert interface .",
    "finally , we do not consider the phonon - assisted  @xcite or nonlinear absorption .",
    "the list of these major simplifications also suggest possible improvements of this work .",
    "in this section we present our theoretical investigation of the linear optical properties of si and ge ncs .",
    "three different direct photon absorption processes are considered as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] each of which can serve for technological applications as well as to our basic understanding . however , we first begin with the dependence of the optical gap on the nc size , mainly as a check of our general framework .",
    "there exist two different atomic arrangements of a spherical nc depending on whether the center of the nc is an atomic position or a tetrahedral interstitial location ; under no ionic relaxation , delley and steigmeier have treated both of these classes as having the @xmath61 point symmetry .",
    "@xcite however , the tetrahedral interstitial - centered arrangement should rather have the lower point symmetry of @xmath0 and it is the arrangement that we construct our ncs .",
    "this leads to even number of nc core atoms , whereas it becomes an odd number with the @xmath61 point symmetry .",
    "we identify the irreducible representation of a chosen nc state by checking its projection to the subspace of each representation .",

    "another important technical remark is about the epm cut off energies .",
    "we observed that even though the epm band energies ( i.e. , eigenvalues ) converge reasonably well with cut off energies as low as 5 - 10 ry , the corresponding bloch functions ( i.e. , eigenvectors ) require substantially higher values to converge .  @xcite the results in this study are obtained using 14 and 16 ry for si , ge , respectively .",

    "<S> embedded si and ge nanocrystals ( ncs ) in wide band - gap matrices are studied theoretically using an atomistic pseudopotential approach . from small clusters to large ncs containing on the order of several thousand atoms are considered . </S>",
    "<S> effective band - gap values as a function of nc diameter reproduce very well the available experimental and theoretical data . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the highest occupied molecular orbital for both si and ge ncs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for si ncs display oscillations with respect to size among the different irreducible representations of the @xmath0 point group to which these spherical ncs belong . </S>",
    "<S> based on this electronic structure , first the interband absorption is thoroughly studied which shows the importance of surface polarization effects that significantly reduce the absorption when included . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction is found to increase with decreasing nc size or with increasing permittivity mismatch between the nc core and the host matrix . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable agreement is observed with the experimental absorption spectra where available . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation of spherical ncs into prolate or oblate ellipsoids are seen to introduce no pronounced effects for the absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> next , intraconduction and intravalence band absorption coefficients are obtained in the wavelength range from far - infrared to visible region . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be valuable for the infrared photodetection prospects of these nc arrays . finally , </S>",
    "<S> excited - state absorption at three different optical pump wavelengths , 532  nm , 355  nm and 266  nm are studied for 3- and 4  nm - diameter ncs . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals strong absorption windows in the case of holes and a broad spectrum in the case of electrons which can especially be relevant for the discussions on achieving gain in these structures . </S>"
