    "the solar convection zone is filled with turbulent thermal convection due to its superadiabatic stratification , which is maintained by the radiative energy flux from the core of the sun . due to the influence of rotation ,",
    "the anisotropic convection transports angular momentum as well as energy .",
    "this maintains mean flows such as the meridional flow and the differential rotation .",
    "these flows are thought to be important for the dynamo and related eleven - year cyclic variations of the sunspot numbers .",
    "in addition , the turbulent thermal convection itself is also important for the generation of the magnetic field . idealized simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the realistic calculations for the photosphere have suggested that chaotic motions have the ability to maintain magnetic energy through a small - scale dynamo process .",
    "such dynamos have not been studied so far on the the global scale , i.e. , the entire convection zone .",
    "the purpose of this study is to achieve multi - scale convection , including scales from @xmath6  mm ( smaller than supergranulation ) up to @xmath7  mm ( global scale ) .",
    "we accomplish this by approaching the solar surface up to @xmath8 using unprecedented resolution , studying in particular the influence of the location of the upper boundary on the convective structure in the deeper parts of the convection zone .",

    " [ discussion ] .",
    "developing numerical simulations of solar global convection is challenging due to the high resolution and the broad range of dynamical time scales that are required .",
    "one of the most paramount difficulties arises from the high speed of sound and the related low mach - number flows throughout most of the convection zone . at the base of the convection zone ,",
    "the speed of sound is about @xmath9 , while the speed of convection is thought to be @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the time step must therefore be shorter owing to the cfl ( courant - friedrichs - lewy ) condition in an explicit fully compressible method , even when we are interested in the phenomena related to convection . in order to avoid this situation , the anelastic approximation is frequently adopted in which the mass conservation equation is replaced with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the reference density and @xmath13 is the fluid velocity . in this approximation , the speed of sound is assumed to be infinite , and we need to solve the elliptic equation for the pressure , which filters out the propagation of the sound wave . since the anelastic approximation is well applicable deep in the convection zone and the time step",
    "is no longer limited by the large speed of sound , the solar global convection has been investigated with this method in numerous studies about the differential rotation , the meridional flow , the global dynamo , and the dynamical coupling of the radiative zone @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two drawbacks in the anelastic approximation .",
    "the first is the breakdown of the approximation near the solar surface . since the convection velocity becomes higher and the speed of sound becomes lower in the near - surface layer ( @xmath14 ) , these have similar values and the anelastic approximation can not be applied .",
    "since the interaction between the small - scale convection generated in the near - surface layer ( granulation and supergranulation ) and large scale convection ( giant cell and global one ) is an important topic , the connection between the near - surface layer and the global convection has been investigated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the global calculation , however , which includes all such multiple scales , has not been achieved yet .",
    "the second drawback is the difficulty arising from the increase of the required resolution .",
    "the pseudo - spectral method based on the spherical harmonic expansion is frequently adopted , especially for solving the elliptic equation of the pressure . in this method",
    ", non - linear terms require the transformation of the physical variable from the real space to the spectral space , and vice versa every time step .",
    "the calculation cost of the transformation is estimated as @xmath15 due to the absence of a fast algorithm for the legendre transformation , which is as powerful as the fast fourier transformation ( fft ) , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the maximum mode numbers in the latitude and the longitude respectively .",
    "thus the computational cost of this method is significant , limiting the achievable resolution . owing to this",
    ", some numerical calculations of the geodynamo adopt the finite difference method in order to achieve high resolution @xcite . as explained above , when the near - surface layer is included in the calculation ,",
    "the typical convection scale becomes small and a large number of grid points is required .",
    "the resolution is one of the keys to access the solar surface .",
    "we note that some studies using the finite difference have been done in the stellar or solar context using a moderate ratio of the speed of sound and the convection velocity with adjustments of the radiative flux and the stratification .",
    "although this type of approach provides insights for the maintenance of the mean flow and the magnetic field , proper reproduction using the solar parameters , such as the stratification , the luminosity , the partial ionization effect and the rotation , and direct comparison with actual observations can not be achieved .",
    "the reduced speed of sound technique can overcome these drawbacks while avoiding the severe time step caused by the speed of sound .",
    "in the rsst the equation of continuity is replaced with @xmath18 the speed of sound is then reduced @xmath19 times , but the dispersion relationship for sound waves remains ( where wave speed decreases equally for all wavelengths ) . this technique does not change the hyperbolic character of the equations that can be integrated explicitly . due to this hyperbolicity ,",
    "only the local communication is required , which decreases the communication overhead in parallel computing .",
    "a simple algorithm and low cost of communication are significant factors that enable high resolution calculations . investigated the validity of the rsst in a thermal convection problem .",
    "it was concluded that the rsst is valid when the mach number defined with the rms ( root mean square ) velocity and the reduced speed of sound @xmath20 is smaller than 0.7 .",
    "another advantage of this method is its accessibility to the real solar surface with an inhomogeneous @xmath19 .",
    "the mach number varies substantially in the solar convection zone .",
    "when a moderate or zero reduction of the speed of sound is used in the near - surface layer while a large @xmath19 around the bottom part of the convection zone is used , the properties of the thermal convection , even including the surface , can be properly investigated without undermining the physics . confirmed that the inhomogeneous @xmath19 is valid again when the mach number is less than 0.7",
    "we solve the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations with the rsst in the spherical geometry @xmath21 as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath13 , and @xmath27 are the density , the gas pressure , the specific entropy , the temperature , the fluid velocity and the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the subscript 1 denotes the fluctuation from the time - independent spherically symmetric reference state , which has subscript 0 .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the gravitational acceleration , the coefficient of the radiative diffusivity , and the surface cooling term , respectively .",
    "the setting of these values is explained in the following paragraph . in order to close the mhd system ,",
    "we adopt a non - ideal equation of state as : @xmath31 since our upper boundary is at @xmath32 at maximum , in the near - surface region partial ionization is important ( see fig .",
    "[ back]f ) and is included in our treatment ( see appendix [ app : eos ] for details ) by using the opal repository with the solar abundance of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 specify the mass fraction of hydrogen , helium and other metals , respectively .    note that we do not have any explicit turbulent thermal diffusivity and viscosity @xcite in order to maximize the fluid and magnetic reynolds number , but use the artificial viscosity introduced in @xcite .",
    "our treatment ensures that the dissipated kinetic and magnetic energies with the artificial viscosity are converted to the internal energy .",
    "note also that the rotation is not included in this study , since we focus on the connection of thermal convection between the small and large scales and its local dynamo action on the global scale .",
    "the combination of rotation and stratified convection leads to differential rotation and additional turbulent induction effects that enable large - scale dynamo action .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the local dynamo action from global dynamo action if rotation is present .",
    "since the rotation effect in the sun is significant , we will carry out studies of rotating convection in the future .",
    "[ back ] shows our reference state in comparison with model s @xcite .",
    "the reference stratification is determined by solving the one - dimensional hydrostatic equation and the realistic equation of state as : @xmath39 eq .",
    "( [ 1dopal ] ) is calculated with the opal repository including partial ionization .",
    "we set an adiabatic stratification as a reference and initial state .",
    "the stratification becomes superadiabatic after convection develops as a consequence of radiative heating near the bottom and radiative cooling at the top as described below .",
    "the gravitational acceleration and the radiative diffusion are adopted from model s. the boundary is set at @xmath40 with the values from model s , and the equations are integrated inward .    on the actual sun ,",
    "the surface is continuously cooled by the radiation . since our boundary is not located on the real solar surface ( even though it is unprecedentedly closer to the real surface ) , we add an artificial cooling ( @xmath30 ) as : @xmath41 where @xmath42,\\label{cooling}\\\\ & & f_\\mathrm{r}(r ) = -\\kappa_\\mathrm{r}\\rho_0 c_\\mathrm{p}\\frac{dt_0}{dr}\\label{radiative},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the location of the bottom and the top boundary , respectively .",
    "this procedure ensures that the radiative luminosity imposed at the bottom is released through the top boundary . since the realistic simulation for the near - surface layer shows that the thickness of the cooling layer by the radiation is similar to the local pressure scale height ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt two pressure scale heights for the thickness of the cooling layer , i.e. , @xmath45 except for cases h1 and m1 ( see table [ param ] ) , where @xmath46 is the pressure scale height .    we carry out three calculations named h0 , h1 and h2 , with different settings that are primarily hydrodynamic . in case h0 ,",
    "the top boundary is located at @xmath32 , and the density contrast @xmath47 exceeds 600 .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the largest value achieved so far in numerical simulations of solar global convection . in cases h1 and h2 , the top boundary is at @xmath48 , and the density contrast is around 40 . in case h1 ,",
    "the thickness of the cooling layer is the same as case h0 , i.e. , @xmath49 , which is the two pressure scale heights at @xmath32 , while case h2 adopts two scale heights at its top boundary ( @xmath50 ) for the thickness ( @xmath51 ) . our magnetic runs m0 , m1 and m2 use the same settings and differ only through the initial magnetic field added .",
    "we note that the thickness of the cooling layer ( @xmath51 ) has almost the same role as the value of the turbulent thermal diffusivity on the entropy that is adopted in the ash simulation @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "the factor of the rsst is set to make the adiabatic reduced speed of sound uniform in space .",
    "the adiabatic speed of sound is defined as : @xmath52 then the factor of the rsst is set as : @xmath53 in this study , we adopt @xmath54 for all the calculations , thus the reduced speed of sound @xmath55 at all depths .",
    "suggest that the rsst is valid for the thermal convection under the criterion of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the rms ( root mean square ) convection velocity .",
    "thus we can properly treat the convection with @xmath58 in this model .",
    "it is also suggested in that the total mass is not conserved with the inhomogeneous @xmath19 , and we can not avoid long - term drift from the reference state , i.e. , the mass continuously decreases or increases . in this study , however , we adopt a different way to avoid this type of long - term drift . when the equation of continuity is treated as : @xmath59 the value @xmath60",
    "is conserved in a rounding error with appropriate boundary conditions , where @xmath61 although the radial distribution of the density is different from the original one , the fluctuation part remains small ( e.g. @xmath62 ) , and this does not affect the character of the thermal convection",
    ". it is confirmed in that statistical features are not influenced by the inhomogeneous @xmath19 .",
    "we use the stress - free and the impenetrable boundary conditions for the fluid velocity , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the free boundary condition is adopted for the density and the entropy , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "the magnetic field is vertical at the top boundary , and the perfect conductor boundary condition is used at the bottom boundary .",
    "@xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are zero initially .",
    "the fluid velocities @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 have small random values .",
    "after the convection reaches a statistically steady state , a uniform magnetic field ( @xmath72 ) is added .",
    "although a net toroidal flux exists initially using this condition , it disappears through the upper boundary after around @xmath73 days , since horizontal magnetic field is zero there .",
    "thus we do not need to consider the influence of the net flux for our local dynamo study .    under the setting",
    "explained above , we solve the equations ( [ eqco])-([eqen ] ) by using the fourth - order runge - kutta scheme for the time - integration and the fourth - order space - centered derivative .",
    "the divergence free condition , i.e. , @xmath74 , is maintained with the diffusion scheme for each runge - kutta loop ( see the @xcite appendix for details ) . in order to include all the spherical shell , we adopt the yin - yang grid @xcite .",
    "the yin - yang grid is a set of two congruent spherical geometries .",
    "they are combined in a complemental way to cover a whole spherical shell . the boundary condition for each grid",
    "is calculated using the interpolation of the other grid . in all of our calculations ,",

    "@xmath84 is the location of the base of the convection zone and @xmath44 is taken as a parameter ( @xmath85 for the typical case ) .",
    "although the boundary condition for the yin grid is applied on the edge of the yin grid , the boundary condition for the yang grid is applied on the edge of the yin grid in order to avoid the double solution in the overlapping area of the yin - yang grid .",

    "the number of grid points in the radial direction is shown in table [ param ] . since this resolution in yin - yang geometry has almost the same quality as that of @xmath87 in ordinary spherical geometry in cases h0 and m0 , we succeed in doubling the resolution in each direction from the previous study @xcite . after the uniform magnetic field is added , the calculations are newly named m0 , m1 and m2 , which use the results of h0 , h1 , and h2 , respectively .",
    "using a hybrid mpi and automatic intra - node parallelization approach , the code scales efficiently up to @xmath88 cores with almost linear weak scaling , and achieves a 14% performance at maximum on the riken k - computer in japan .",

    "3 . using an les approach",
    "we can achieve small - scale dynamo action and maintain a field of about @xmath4 throughout the convection zone .",
    "4 . the overall dynamo efficiency varies significantly in the convection zone as a consequence of the downward directed poynting flux and the depth variation of the intrinsic convective scales . for a fixed numerical resolution ,",
    "the dynamo - relevant scales are better resolved in the deeper convection zone and are therefore less affected by numerical diffusivity , i.e. , the effective reynolds numbers are larger .",

    "the observed convection amplitude is much smaller than that in the hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "we expected that the modification to the location of the upper boundary may help to resolve this issue .",
    "conclusion 1 above , however , suggests that the difference between the calculation and the observation becomes larger when we move the top boundary further upward .",
    "we see , nevertheless , some indication that the kinetic energy is reduced on the largest scales when a local dynamo is present . at the same time , we can not fully rule out the possibility that unresolved small - scale turbulence near the top boundary contributes to this issue , since the intrinsic scale of the convection near our top boundary is still not well resolved .",
    "conclusion 2 is one of the most important results in this study , since it suggests that previous calculations such as by @xcite are physically reasonable in the deeper convection zone even if the top boundary condition is placed significantly below the solar surface .",
    "we summarize our simulation results in a schematic picture shown in fig .",
    "[ local_dynamo_fig ] .",
    "the conclusion that the dynamo is ineffective near the top comes from the comparison of the kinematic and saturated spectra and the only moderate reduction of the effective shear in the upper convection zone ( see  [ local_dynamo ] ) . since several aspects ,",
    "in particular with regard to the local dynamo , require higher resolution before being directly applicable to the solar convection zone , fig .",
    "[ local_dynamo_fig ] does not necessarily apply to the real sun .",
    "high resolution simulations of a local dynamo in the solar photosphere suggest that efficient dynamo action is possible even in the presence of the pumping effect .",
    "these simulations use , however , a grid resolution of about a factor of @xmath212 larger than our setup , which is currently inapplicable for global scale convection simulations .",
    "therefore , the dynamo rms field strength of @xmath4 can likely be considered a lower limit .",
    "one issue we can not address in this study is the problem regarding the small magnetic prandtl number ( @xmath213 ) in the solar convection zone , since we adopt numerical diffusivities which assume that the magnetic prandtl number is around unity .",
    "several authors argued that smaller magnetic prandtl numbers make local dynamos less efficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , a small magnetic prandtl number requires a larger magnetic reynolds number in order to achieve a super - critical dynamo . while this can be a significant problem for numerical simulations with rather moderate reynolds numbers , this is less likely an issue in the solar convection zone with reynolds numbers as large as @xmath214 @xcite .",
    "thus we believe that our approach relying only on numerical diffusivities can capture the physics of the local dynamo in the solar convection zone .",
    "rotation is not included in this study although it plays a key role in organizing large - scale flows and enabling large - scale dynamo action . studying",
