    "in various applied research papers , many authors extensively use what they call a continuous poisson distribution  and a continuous binomial distribution , providing these terms with very different , not always correct meanings .",
    "for example , by the continuous poisson distribution , some authors ( @xcite , @xcite ) understand an absolutely continuous distribution with the density of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a normalizing constant .",
    "some others use to this end the @xmath0-distribution ( @xcite , @xcite ) or even simply the exponential distribution ( @xcite ) .    from the strictly formal point of view",
    ", the above distributions can not be regarded as genuine continuous analogues of the classical poisson law , since these distributions have probabilistically little in common with this law . in this paper",
    ", we make an attempt to introduce continuous counterparts of poisson and binomial distributions in a more natural way , on the basis of integral representations of poisson and binomial distribution functions via complete and incomplete euler @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions , and examine some properties of these counterparts .",
    "note that these distributions appeared in various forms ( although without any detailed exposition ) in the papers of g. marsaglia @xcite , h. stern @xcite , as well as in the solution of problem 3.4.1.22 in the book of d. knuth @xcite . in paper @xcite and book",
    "@xcite they were employed for the computer simulation of the classical poisson and binomial distributions . in report @xcite , it is noted that the continuous poisson distribution is closely related to the distribution of the time when @xmath0-process jumps over a fixed level .",
    "this relation will be discussed in detail at the end of the paper .    in the present work , we proceed with the research started in paper @xcite .",
    "recall the standard notation which will be used in what follows : for @xmath5 set @xmath6 besides , we will need incomplete euler @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions : @xmath7 in particular , we have for the usual ( complete ) @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions : @xmath8    denote by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the classical poisson distribution , i.e. a discrete probability measure on the set @xmath11 given by @xmath12 .",
    "also denote by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 $ ] , the classical binomial distribution , i.e. a discrete probability measure on the set @xmath16 given by @xmath17 .",
    "it is well - known that the distribution function @xmath18 of the poisson measure @xmath9 admits a representation in terms of functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath21 a similar representation via @xmath1-functions holds true for the distribution function @xmath22 of the binomial measure @xmath13 : @xmath23    representations ( [ df_dp ] ) and ( [ df_db ] ) can be attributed to a sort of probabilistic folklore  ( see e.g. @xcite , where they are given as problems ) .",
    "the proofs are a simple exercise in integration by parts .",
    "taking representations ( [ df_dp ] ) and ( [ df_db ] ) into account , the following definitions appear to be quite natural .",
    "[ cp ] by _ continuous poisson distribution with parameter @xmath10 _ we will mean the probability measure @xmath24 supported by @xmath25 with distribution function of the form @xmath26    [ cb ] by _ continuous binomial distribution with parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 _ we will mean the probability measure @xmath29 supported by @xmath30 $ ] with distribution function of the form @xmath31    note that in definition [ cb ] parameter @xmath32 may take non - integer values ; we continue to denote it with @xmath32 only by tradition .",
    "we should first check whether the distributions introduced by definitions [ cp ] and [ cb ] are well defined . to this end , we show that the following assertions hold true :    * @xmath33 ; * @xmath34 ; * the function @xmath35 increases in @xmath36 on the interval @xmath25 ; * @xmath37 ; * @xmath38 ; * the function @xmath39 increases in @xmath36 on the segment @xmath30 $ ] .    assertions ( i ) and ( iv ) hold , since the numerators are bounded as @xmath40 while the denominators increase to infinity .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 is bounded as @xmath42 while @xmath43 increases to infinity , which yields ( v ) .",
    "( ii ) follows from the fact that @xmath44 has an asymptotic order @xmath45 as @xmath46 , in other words is @xmath47 .",
    "finally , assertions ( iii ) and ( vi ) result from the following relations : @xmath48 note that we changed @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 in the upper limits of the inner integrals due to antisymmetry of the integrands with respect to the argument pair @xmath53 .    the result can be summarized in the next statement . here",
    "@xmath54 stands for @xmath25 .",
    "[ d_cpb ] the distribution functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 given by ( [ df_cp ] ) and ( [ df_cb ] ) define absolutely continuous ( with respect to the lebesgue measure ) probability distributions on the measurable space @xmath57 .",
    "their densities are of form ( [ d_cp ] ) and ( [ d_cb ] ) .",
    "in this section , we study the moments of the continuous poisson distribution .",
    "they turn out to be closely related to classical volterra functions , which play a role in integral transforms .",
    "we first give the corresponding definitions ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) . in the most general form ,",
    "the volterra @xmath58-function is defined by @xmath59 in particular , by setting @xmath60 we come to a simpler and more known volterra @xmath61-function : @xmath62 .    for a fixed @xmath63 ,",
    "consider the @xmath64-order moment function of the continuous poisson distribution : @xmath65 then we have @xmath66 by the definition of complete and incomplete @xmath0-functions and fubini theorem @xmath67    the moments of the continuous poisson distribution look particularly nice in terms of laplace transform in @xmath50 . again by fubini theorem we have @xmath68 the laplace transform @xmath69 of the volterra function @xmath58 is of the form @xmath70 ( see e.g. @xcite ; anyway , this can be deduced by a simple calculation . )",
    "thus , ( [ pm_l1 ] ) yields @xmath71    the previous relation makes it possible to find the double laplace transform ( laplace - stieltjes with respect to measure and laplace with respect to @xmath50 ) of the distribution family @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath10 , denote a random variable distributed by the continuous poisson law with parameter @xmath50 .",
    "then , for @xmath74 we have @xmath75    we now resume all the above in the next statement .    the moments of the continuous poisson distribution @xmath24 are given by formula ( [ pm_v ] ) . in terms of laplace transform they can be expressed as ( [ pm_l2 ] ) .",
    "the double laplace transform of the distribution family @xmath72 is of form ( [ dlt ] ) .",
    "the classical poisson theorem ( sometimes also called the law of rare events ) asserts that under the condition @xmath2 the sequence of binomial distributions with parameters @xmath76 weakly converges to the poisson one with parameter @xmath50 . in this section ,",
    "we show that this remains true also for their continuous counterparts .",
    "[ ct ] let @xmath77 be a sequence of continuous binomial distributions .",
    "if @xmath78 and @xmath79 as @xmath80 in such a way that @xmath81 then @xmath82 .    we break the proof up into three lemmas .",
    "[ l1 ] for arbitrary @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 @xmath85    _ proof .",
    "_ performing a simple integration by parts , we have @xmath86 which yields ( [ l11 ] ) by the relationship between @xmath0- and @xmath87-functions .",
    "( [ l12 ] ) can be obtained in a similar manner .",
    "[ l2 ] under the conditions of theorem [ ct ] @xmath88    the proof follows from lemma [ l1 ] and elementary computations with stirling s formula and is thus omitted .",
    "[ l3 ] let @xmath89 be a sequence of probability measures on the measurable space @xmath57 .",
    "if for each @xmath90 @xmath91 then the weak convergence of @xmath92 to @xmath93 holds .",
    "lemma [ l3 ] actually implies that the intervals @xmath94 , @xmath90 , form a convergence determining class ( see e.g. @xcite , p. 18 ) .    _ proof .",
    "_ denote by @xmath95 the distribution function of the measure @xmath92 . for a fixed @xmath96 let @xmath97 be such an integer that @xmath98 .",
    "then , for each @xmath99 and @xmath90 @xmath100 and so @xmath101    the absolute value on the right - hand side in ( [ ddf ] ) tends to zero as @xmath80 due to condition ( [ l2c ] ) . since @xmath102",
    ", we have @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , @xmath104 letting now at first @xmath80 and then @xmath105 , we obtain by ( [ ddf ] ) that @xmath106 which was to be proved .",
    "proof of theorem [ ct ] follows immediately from lemmas [ l2 ] and [ l3 ] .",
    "in this section , we show that the continuous poisson distribution appears as the distribution of the ( in a proper way normalized ) time when @xmath0-process jumps over a fixed level .",
    "we start with an informal explanation of this phenomenon .",
    "consider a sequence of independent identically exponentially distributed random variables @xmath107 and the sequence of their cumulative sums @xmath108 : @xmath109 .",
    "also set @xmath110 .",
    "it is well known that the renewal process @xmath111 constructed by the sequence @xmath112 as @xmath113 is the classical poisson process .",
    "the question is whether this setting can be carried into continuous time in such a way that the continuous poisson distribution occurs instead of the classical one .    to answer this question we look upon the sequence @xmath112 as a lvy process in discrete time , i.e. random sequence with independent homogeneous increments",
    ". we can carry this process into continuous time , since the distribution of unit increments ( the exponential one ) is infinitely divisible . what s more , it is a special case of the @xmath0-distribution",
    ". thus we may regard the @xmath0-process as a natural continuous counterpart of the sequence @xmath112 .",
