    "simulating the data that a space instrument like corot will provide might look presomptuous .",
    "indeed , it is certainly , when comparing to previous comparable instruments like iphir or golf .",
    "these two examples show that the nominal behaviour of the instrument is not always reached , but this does not prevent this instrument to provide very interesting data .",
    "however , despite some technical problems , iphir and golf yielded a wealth of scientific results .",
    "thus , what is the interest of simulating corot data ? how close to reality these simualtions will get ? this might not be the most important fact as the preparation of these simulations will help us to prepare the analysis of real data and to be ready in case of unexpected technical behaviour of the instrument perturbating the data , or unexpected physical behaviour of the targets of the instrument .",
    "a consequence of that is that the simulation tool must include technical and physical aspects , making the task even more difficult .",
    "these aspects cover : photon noise , p modes excitation , granulation signal , stellar activity signal , orbital perturbations , stellar rotation ...    the software presented here is freely available at : + www.lesia.obspm.fr/@xmath0corotswg/simulightcurve.html",
    "the photon noise is certainly the easiest component of the noise to simulate ... as far as it has the expected behaviour : a true white noise with a variance depending on the photon counts .",
    "the corot specifications impose a level of photon noise of @xmath1  ppm in the amplitude spectrum of a star of magitude @xmath2 for an observing duration of 5 days . the stellar flux for a given magnitude @xmath3 being related to the stellar magnitude by : @xmath4 and knowing that the level of noise varies as the square root of the flux , the level of noise is related to the star magnitude by : @xmath5 as indicated above , this simple relation can model the photon noise but not some other photon counting perturbations as slow ( periods of hours or more ) trends in photon countings which might contributes to the low frequency spectrum of the noise .",
    "the solar - like oscillations are stochastically excited and simulated here following the recipe of @xcite , recalled below .",
    "each solar - like oscillation is a superposition of a large number of excited and damped proper modes .",
    "each solar - like oscillation can then be decomposed as : @xmath6 \\ , exp[-\\eta ( t - t_j ) ] h(t - t_j ) + { \\rm c.c } \\label{simu : eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the amplitude at which the mode @xmath8 with proper frequency @xmath9 is excited by turbulent convection , @xmath10 at which it is excited , @xmath11 is the ( linear ) mode damping rate , @xmath12 is the heaviside function and `` c.c .",
    "'' means complex conjugate .",
    "the fourier transform of eq.[simu : eq1 ] yields the spectrum : @xmath13 whith @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a complex number proportional to @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "as the excitations are random , @xmath10 is random and hence @xmath16 has a random phase .",
    "as the excitation are very numerous , according to the central limit princip the real and imaginary parts of the complex number @xmath18 are distributed according to a normal statitics .",
    "hence the spectrum of the oscillations , @xmath19 , can be simulated by generating the real and imaginary parts of the complex number @xmath18 according to a normal statitics .",
    "an inverse fourier transform is next applied in order to simulate the oscillations in the time domain .",
    "this is the principe of the @xcite s recipe .",
    "the question is now that is the constraints on the mean and variance of @xmath18 . from eq.[simu :",
    "eq2 ] we deduce the power spectrum @xmath20 of the oscillation : @xmath21 the mean mode profile @xmath22 is obtained by averaging eq.[simu : eq3 ] over a larger number of realizations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , which is by definition the variance of the complex number @xmath18 since @xmath25 .",
    "we see from eq.[simu : eq4 ] that the mean profile has a lorentzian shape as it is  in first approximation  observed .    according to the parseval - plancherel relation ,",
    "@xmath12 is related to the mean square of the mode intrinsic amplitude in terms of luminosity fluctuations , @xmath26 , as ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a visibilty factors , which depends on the degree @xmath29 .",
    "once the mode intrinsic amplitude @xmath30 , the mode line width @xmath31 and @xmath28 are given , we have then a constraint on the variance of @xmath18 .",
    "note that the derivation of eqs.[simu : eq2]-[simu : eq5 ] assumes that the the mode life - time ( @xmath32 ) is much shorter than the duration of the observation ( @xmath33 ) , that is @xmath34 .",
    "for life - times much longer than @xmath33 , different expressions are derived but the principe of the simulation remains the same .    for sake of simplicity , we use the adiabatic assumption formulated by @xcite to deduce the maximum of @xmath30 from the maximum of the root mean square mode velocity @xmath35 according to : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective temperature and the symbol @xmath38 refers to quantities related to the sun .",
    "we take for the sun the _ rms values _ @xmath39  ppm ( see table 2 in @xcite and more recently @xcite ) and @xmath40 27  cm / s according to @xcite s seismic observations .    in turn",
    "the root mean square of the mode intrinsic velocity , @xmath41 , is related to the rate @xmath42 at which energy is injected into the mode by turbulent convection and the mode damping rate @xmath43 as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mode mass , @xmath46 the mode inertia , @xmath47 the mode radial displacement and @xmath48 the height above the photosphere where oscillations are measured ( we consider @xmath49 ) . the way the quantities involved in eq.[simu : eq6 ] are model is explained in the next two sects .",
    "theoretical mode damping rates are obtained from the tables calculated by @xcite .",
    "these calculations rely on the non - local and time - dependent formulation of the convection of @xcite ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the computation of the excitation rates @xmath42 is performed according to the model of stochastic excitation of @xcite .",
    "the calculations assume -  as in @xcite  - a lorenzian function for modelling the convective eddy time - correlations .",
    "furthermore , the characteritic wavenumber @xmath50 involved in the theory is assumed to be constant according to the simplification proposed by @xcite .",
    "its value is related to the value @xmath51 inferred in @xcite from a 3d simulation of the sun as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mixing - length evaluated at the layer the convective velocity is maximum .",
    "the solar model we consider is calculated with the cesam code ( @xcite ) and appropriate input physics , described in details in @xcite .",
    "in particular , convection is modelled according to the classical mixing - length theory ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mlt ) with a mixing - length @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pressure scale height and @xmath56 is the mixing - length parameter .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , the atmosphere is restored from the eddington classical gray atmosphere and microscopic diffusion is included according to the simplified formalism of @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the solar model , in luminosity and radius for an age of @xmath57  gyr , fixes the initial helium content @xmath58 , metallicity @xmath59 and the mlt parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the oscillation eigenfunctions and hence the mode masses , @xmath61 , in eq .",
    "[ simu : eq6 ] are calculated with the adiabatic adipls pulsation code ( @xcite ) .",
    "granulation can be considered as noise if the aim of the observation is the stellar oscillations , but it carries some information about the physics of the star , and very valuable information as the convection is a very badly described phenomenon in stellar modelling .",
    "thus , we call it a @xmath62 and not a noise .    however , granulation can be described only with a statistical approach . moreover ,",
    "its contribution in the fourier domain is not independent of frequency : it will contribute more at low frequency .",
    "a common description is to consider that signal @xmath63 as a random signal with some memory : then , its autocorrelation function is : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the amplitude of this signal ( to be related to its variance ) and @xmath66 a characteristic time . knowing that the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function is the squared modulus of the function @xmath63 , one has : @xmath67 thus , the fourier spectrum of the granulation is modelled as a lorentzian which , if it is summed over all frequencies , yields the variance of the signal and then its relation with @xmath65 : @xmath68 so , knowing the intensity standard deviation due to granulation and its characteristic time , it is possible to model its fourier spectrum ( and considering its phase is random , it is possible to model the corresponding time series by an inverse fourier transform ) .",
    "this is in fact the approach developped by @xcite to model the solar noise spectrum , including granulation , mesogranulation and supergranulation .",
    "it can be used to describe any noise with memory ( some electronic noise for example ) .    in the case of granulation ,",
    "the required parameters are estimated from theory of convection .",
    "the eddy size @xmath69 is assumed to be equal to @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mixing - length parameter and @xmath55 the pressure scale height .",
    "the eddy overturn time is related to the eddy convective velocity , @xmath72 , by @xmath73 and is considered as the characteristic time of granulation @xmath66 .",
    "the number of number of eddies seen at the star surface , @xmath74 , is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the star radius .",
    "this relation ignores of course that the medium is higly anisotropic .",
    "according to the mixing - length theory ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , the eddies contrast ( border / center of the granule ) , @xmath77 , can be related to the difference between the temperature gradient of the eddy , @xmath78 and that of the surrounding medium , @xmath79 , according to the relation : @xmath80 in turn , eq .",
    "[ dl_l_eddy ] can be reduced to : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the convection efficiency and @xmath83 the ratio between the convective flux and the total flux of energy .",
    "this relation is finally calibrated in order to match the solar constraints , and the intensity standard deviation for the whole observed disc is @xmath84 all the quantities are obtained on 1d stellar models computed as explained in sect .",
    "[ sect : solar - like - exc ] .",
    "the stellar magnetic activity will induce intensity variation in time , mainly due to the presence of starspots crossing the observed disc because of the rotation .",
    "however , some other sources of intensity variations are expected ( flares for example ) .",
    "a first approach is to consider the intensity variations as described by the same way than granulation . knowing the standard deviation and the characteristic time of intensity variations allows to build the fourier spectrum of these variations as a lorentzian .",
    "this approach has been used for example by @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in the case of magnetic activity is that there is no theoretical description of the phenomenon .",
    "thus , the parameters describing it are empirically derived .",
    "+ the characteristic time is taken as the period of rotation of the star , or , if the rotation is slow , the instrinsic lifetime of a spot .",
    "the latter is arbitrarily chosen as the one in the solar case , computed by @xcite .",
    "the rotation period is computed from an empirical law involving the age and the @xmath85 color index of the star described in the same reference .",
    "+ the standard deviation of intensity variations due to magnetic activity is also derived from an empirical law .",
    "however , this law involves the rossby number @xmath86 ( ratio of rotation period @xmath87 and the overturn convective time at the base of the convection zone @xmath88 ) .",
    "this number can be derived empirically @xcite , but in the present simulations , we derive @xmath88 from models",
    ". then we use empirical laws to estimate @xmath89 .",
    "another approach is to simulate in the intensity time series the influence of individual spots , to estimate their number and contrast ( as for example @xcite ) .",
    "the expected result in the fourier spectrum should be similar to the first approach , but this detailed simulation should allow for rotation measurements .",
    "this approach will be included in a further version of our simulation software .    , showing that the p modes are easily detected , as well as granulation and activity , width=359 ]",
    "a first example of the output of this software is shown in fig.[comp_sun ] : a simulation of a sun with a magnitude @xmath90 ( in order to have a very weak phoon noise ) is compared with a spectrum from the loi photometer ( @xcite ) onboard soho .",
    "the agreement between simulation and ovservation is good , except maybe at very low frequency : the activity component of the signal is overestimated in the simulation ( this is explained as the sun does not fit very well the empirical law used for activity estimation ) . + the following example is a sun with a magnitude @xmath91 , showing that both p modes and activity should be visible with corot for such a star ( fig.[sun_m6 ] ) .",
    "another example is shown in fig.[star1.5_m8 ] for a star of 1.5  solar mass and an age of 2.4  gyr : again , p modes and activity are detectable .     for a star with a mass @xmath92 and a magnitude @xmath93 , showing also p modes , granulation and activity signatures , width=359 ]",
    "this simulator software will continue to evolve with time . as indicated above ,",
    "intensity modulation due to starspots will be included , as well as other stellar or instrumental signals , as for example instrumental perturbations due to orbital vraiations .",
    "moreover , this effort of simulation will not end with the delivery of first data but will be continued after that .",
    "the comparison with real data will allow to check for the validity of physical hypothesis used to simulate the different signals of astrophysics origin in the data .",
    "this shoud bring a great amount of information on our knowmedge of these often not well known phenomena , which stellar simulation is often derived from the solar case . in parallel , the simulation of instrumental components of the signal will be improved to help the interpretation of real data .",
    "all these reasons justify in our opinion the need for the simulation tool presented here .            ,",
