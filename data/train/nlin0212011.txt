    "in this work we calculate very high lying eigenvalues of a billiard system using the so - called scaling method  @xcite .",
    "this method has two main advantages , it is formulated on the boundary of the billiard ( allowing matrices of order @xmath0 , the wavenumber ) and it avoids zeroes searching algorithms .",
    "we have solved the helmholtz equation with dirichlet boundary conditions on the billiard boundary .",
    "a point worth to mention is that any eigenfunction is @xmath1 at domain points . at straight segments of the boundary ,",
    "eigenfunctions are reflected as odd functions , so that the result satisfies the dirichlet condition .",
    "though being also @xmath1 at the boundary by straight pieces , they are not analytical at a vertex when two segments of the boundary join ( with inner angle @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a noninteger number ) .",
    "this feature leads to what we address as diffractive phenomena .",
    "the main idea behind the scaling method is that the trial functions of the variational problem can be parametrised by energy ( alternatively , by the wavenumber @xmath0 ) . with this idea in mind",
    "these functions are expanded in a suitable scaling basis ( plane waves with different propagation directions are one example and these are the elements we use here ) . asking the function to be zero at the boundary of the billiard is the same as asking its norm there to be zero as well .",
    "then , eigenvalues ( and eigenfunctions ) can be obtained by solving a generalised eigenvalue problem that involves the quadratic form associated with the norm of the function on the boundary .    in applying the method to this system ,",
    "evanescent waves were needed .",
    "this is because real plane wave solutions to the helmholtz equation can not represent all the features of diffraction .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that an evanescent plane wave , which oscillates along propagation direction faster than the wavenumber @xmath0 , can be constructed by means of real plane waves .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding superposition is a singular one , suggesting the direct use of the evanescent functions in the basis .",
    "this is the way we have dealt with diffraction .    for simplicity",
    "we restrict our considerations to an angle of @xmath4 . a particularly suitable example to study",
    "the effect of this kind of corner on the quantum properties is the polygonal billiard shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : billiard ] .",
    "this billiard is called the truncated triangle .",
    "it has been studied in a variety of contexts  @xcite .",
    "the truncated triangle belongs to the class of _ rational polygons_. that are polygons where all angles @xmath5 between sides are rationally related to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are relatively prime integers .",
    "the free motion inside a rational polygon is integrable if @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , which is the case for rectangles , the equilateral triangles , the @xmath10-triangles and the @xmath11-triangles .",
    "all other rational polygons are _ pseudointegrable _  @xcite . like in integrable systems",
    ", the phase space is foliated by two - dimensional invariant surfaces  @xcite . however , the genus of the surfaces is greater than one due to _ critical corners _ with @xmath12  @xcite . in the case of the truncated triangle ,",
    "the genus is @xmath13 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the invariant surface is a torus with an additional handle .",
    "quantum signatures of pseudointegrability can be found in the energy eigenfunctions  @xcite and in the statistical properties of energy levels  @xcite .",
    "the energy levels of pseudointegrable systems are correlated in contrast to those of integrable systems which are generically well described by the poissonian random processes  @xcite .",
    "for example , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of pseudointegrable systems generically displays level repulsion  @xcite , resembling the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random - matrix theory  @xcite which describes fully chaotic systems with time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "significant deviations from goe have been observed first in refs .",
    "it has been suggested that the spectral statistics of pseudointegrable systems is another example of critical or intermediate statistics  @xcite .",
    "critical statistics appear in many condensed matter problems such as in mesoscopic disordered systems at the critical point of the metal - insulator transition  @xcite , in systems with a few interacting electrons  @xcite , and in incommensurate multiwalled carbon nanotubes  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed to use the semi - poisson ( sp ) statistics as a reference point for critical statistics .",
    "the sp statistics is defined by a simple construction : remove every other level from an ordered poisson sequence  @xcite .",
    "the sp statistics is useful because it provides explicit formulas for a number of statistical quantities which can be compared to the statistical properties of a given system . for several pseudointegrable systems  @xcite",
    "it has been confirmed that the sp statistics indeed describes the short - range level correlations rather well .",
    "comparing the long - range level correlations is numerically a difficult task because the statistical properties of rational polygons converge extremely slowly as energy is increased  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , semiclassical periodic - orbit theory allows to compute analytically the long - range level correlations , in terms of the level compressibility @xmath14 , of a few special systems , like certain right triangles  @xcite and the barrier billiard  @xcite . in the former case @xmath14",
    "differs in general from the sp result , whereas in the latter case @xmath14 is in agreement with the sp statistics .",
    "nothing is known analytically about the generic case .",
    "our numerical analysis will show that the truncated triangle is well described by the sp statistics but deviations are not negligible .",
    "our analysis extends that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite in many respects : ( i ) the scaling method allows us to compute more levels , giving a better statistics .",
    "( ii ) moreover , high - lying energy levels can be computed .",
    "this puts us in a position to study the relevant asymptotic regime .",
    "( iii ) more statistical quantities are computed .",
    "( iv ) the numerical results are compared to the sp statistics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : scaling ] , we describe the features that are considered when applying the scaling method to the system under investigation . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we present the statistical studies carried out with the data that has been obtained .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we are not going to explain the scaling method here , and we address the reader to the appendix and the given references for details .",
    "an eigenfunction of a billiard can be constructed as a plane wave superposition .",
    "this can include evanescent waves , i.e. , plane waves with complex wave vectors .",
    "these types of waves should be present in quantum billiards and can be associated with diffractive phenomena .",
    "discontinuities at the boundaries seem to be strongly related to the way evanescent functions must be considered to solve the problem .",
    "several authors have focused their attention on this issue  @xcite . for polygonal billiards , in the generic case",
    ", theory suggests that there is no real plane wave superposition that can be an eigenfunction  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "good numerical results using only plane waves could be found  @xcite , but working within the region of low energies .",
    "evanescent waves were studied in detail by berry  @xcite in the context of quantum billiards . in this approach , the main reason to do it comes from the idea of constructing them by continuation of an external scattering superposition , containing only real plane waves . in principle",
    ", this does not seem to be possible .",
    "anyway , he showed how evanescent waves can be expressed as the singular limit of an angular superposition of real plane waves .",
    "in our system , and working at high energies , we need to consider evanescent waves explicitely , because a real plane wave representation is singular . in the semiclassical limit ,",
    "the only way to obtain eigenfunctions that include evanescent waves is by considering them in the variational problem  @xcite . in the remaining part of this section we are going to show some examples of the waves considered and the idea behind their selection .",
    "plane wave solutions to the helmholtz equation can be written as @xmath15}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 and @xmath17 real , using coordinates @xmath18 in the plane .",
    "we can express this wave in a slightly different fashion by distinguishing the real and imaginary parts in the exponent ,    @xmath19 }   \\ ;",
    "\\exp{[-k \\sinh{(\\alpha})\\tilde y]}.\\ ] ] here , the propagation direction @xmath20 implies an angle @xmath16 over the @xmath21 axis . in this direction",
    "the function has a wavelength that is given by @xmath22 .",
    "however , in the orthogonal direction @xmath23 the function is an exponential with coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "an example of these functions applied to our system can be found in fig .",
    "[ evadom ] , where we show an evanescent wave corresponding to the truncated triangle of parameter value @xmath25 ( note that since the absolute size of the system is irrelevant , we measure length scales as dimensionless quantities ) . in this case we chose @xmath26 in order to have a visible wave .",
    "for the higher - lying wave numbers ( @xmath27 or greater ) these functions are difficult to see in the domain since they decay very fast .",
    "nevertheless , the slower oscillating functions we have used in the latter energy region can be seen over the boundary .     on the truncated triangle domain with parameter value @xmath25 .",
    "the propagation direction @xmath28 ( given by @xmath29 in this case ) and the corresponding decaying direction @xmath23 are both shown by the arrows . also , we point out values @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the arclength coordinate @xmath32.,width=226 ]    now that the general ideas related to evanescent waves have been exposed , we are going to explain the way we selected them , and we are also going to show some examples for @xmath33 .",
    "the first thing to point out is that diffraction is generated at the critical corner with angle @xmath34 that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : billiard ] .",
    "so , our sets or families of evanescent waves are centered at this corner .",
    "we consider three different kinds of functions , all sharing the previous property , but decaying to one or the other  side \" of the corner ( in terms of the arclength boundary coordinate @xmath32 ) in the first place and also an additional one that decays to both sides .",
    "we use a family of 12 waves whose propagation direction @xmath16 is slightly smaller than @xmath35 , i.e. , around the right hand side of the boundary as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : billiard ] , another set of 8 waves with almost horizontal propagation and finally one that goes along an intermediate direction ( for this one we took a value of @xmath36 , as can be seen in fig .  [ evadom ] ) .",
    "in fact , in order to appreciate their contribution , it is convenient to look at them on the boundary of the billiard . for this reason we show in fig .",
    "[ evbound ] three examples of evanescent waves that are good representatives of these three families .",
    "as already mentioned , the exponential decay is from the critical corner , which corresponds to @xmath37 in terms of the boundary coordinate .",
    "this is the effect of considering an angle slightly different from @xmath38 angle for the propagation direction .",
    "the same happens with the second family whose example is directed almost along the horizontal ( left ) segment of the boundary .",
    "finally , we show the evanescent wave that decays to both sides of the corner .    .",
    "vertical axis corresponds to the real part of the evanescent wave in arbitrary units .",
    "horizontal axis corresponds to the boundary arclength coordinate @xmath32 ( dimensionless ) . in ( a ) we show a wave decaying to the right ( propagation direction given by @xmath39 ) , in ( b ) one to the left ( @xmath40 ) , and in ( c ) to both sides ( @xmath29 ) from @xmath37 , the position of the critical corner.,width=264 ]    this approach to the problem has proven to be very efficient . as a matter of fact , studying carefully several billiard eigenfunctions that show the greatest norm ( error ) over the boundary ( without considering evanescent waves in their calculation ) , we could check that these are the main components of the diffracted field .",
    "then we apply the symmetries of our system in order to get the right contributions .",
    "this is easy to implement by using the symmetry operations of the @xmath41 group .",
    "we have taken only up to 21 evanescent waves in order to get our results .",
    "this is a small number compared to the roughly 1000 real plane waves that are used in the highest - lying energy window we have obtained  @xcite .",
    "but they are key to lower the error of the eigenvalues .",
    "this shows that , even though the relevance of this contribution goes to zero in the semiclassical limit we need to consider it in order to resolve individual states .",
    "we here examine the spectral statistics of the quantized truncated triangle .",
    "we consider the generic case where @xmath31 is an irrational number . in the nongeneric case of @xmath31 being rational",
    ", the energy spectrum contains a subset of poisson distributed levels  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the parameter value @xmath25 , the reciprocal of the golden mean . for other parameter values of @xmath31 [ @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 similar results",
    "have been obtained .",
    "we use energy windows of length @xmath45 in five different regimes starting with level number @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 corresponding to the wave number @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .    to study the local fluctuations in the level sequence @xmath56",
    "it is necessary to remove the systematic global energy dependence of the average density .",
    "to do so , we `` unfold ''",
    "the spectra in the usual way by setting @xmath57 ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xmath58 is the smooth part of the integrated density of states , i.e. , the number of levels up to energy @xmath59 .",
    "we approximate @xmath58 by the generalized weyl s law including perimeter and corner corrections  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the area of the billiard , @xmath62 is the perimeter , and @xmath63 is the corner correction .",
    "the unfolded spectra @xmath64 have unit mean level spacing and are dimensionless .",
    "henceforth , the tilde will be suppressed .",
    "the most popular statistical quantity in the field of quantum chaos is the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution .",
    "it is defined as the probability density of the spacing @xmath65 ( in units of the mean level spacing ) between adjacent levels , @xmath66 clearly , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution is a measure of short - range level correlations .",
    "we will compute its integral , the cumulative spacing distribution @xmath67 for the poisson statistics @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the goe is well described by the wigner surmise @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and for the sp statistics  @xcite @xmath72 at small @xmath65 , @xmath73 exhibits a linear increase from zero ( level repulsion ) similar to the wigner surmise . at large @xmath65 , @xmath73 has an exponential fall - off as the poisson statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnnzero ] we plot the difference between the cumulative spacing distribution to the sp result for the lowest - energy window .",
    "good agreement with the sp statistics can be observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : cnn ] shows a magnification , containing also the other energy windows .",
    "we see increasing deviations from sp for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and then decreasing deviations for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "no clear trend to sp is visible as one goes to higher energies .",
    "similar small deviations from the sp statistics have been observed at the metal - insulator transition in the three - dimensional anderson model . in that case",
    ", an ensemble average over certain boundary conditions removes the deviations considerably  @xcite . to see whether this is possible also in our case , we consider neumann boundary conditions on the two boundary segments which do not touch the critical corner ;",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : billiard ] . in this way",
    "we obtain four energy spectra corresponding to dirichlet / dirichlet , dirichlet / neumann , neumann / dirichlet , and neumann / neumann - boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast to the case of the anderson model we find that averaging over these boundary conditions does not reduce the deviation from the sp statistics .",
    "we now consider the next - to - nearest spacing distribution ( second - neighbor - spacing distribution ) and its integral .",
    "the sp statistics gives  @xcite @xmath78    figure  [ fig : nextcnn ] shows that the cumulative next - to - nearest spacing distribution is well described by the sp statistics .",
    "the maximal deviations from sp are smaller than in the case of the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnn ] .",
    "but , again , there is no clear convergence to the sp statistics as one goes to higher energies .",
    "so far we have studied short - range level correlations ( nearest and next - to - nearest spacing distributions ) .",
    "long - range level correlations are conveniently studied with the help of the number variance @xmath79 @xmath80 is the local variance of the number @xmath81 of energy levels in the interval @xmath82 $ ] . for the sp statistics we have  @xcite @xmath83    figure  [ fig : sigma ]",
    "shows the number variance computed for the five energy windows .",
    "note that the regime is well below the crossover region where @xmath80 begins to saturate at a value determined by the shortest periodic orbit  @xcite . with increasing energy",

    "@xcite ) with @xmath14 from eq .",

    "it is difficult to estimate @xmath101 from such kinds of noisy data , but it is justified to say that @xmath101 is below the sp prediction @xmath90 , in agreement with our former numerical results on the number variance .    a better way to compare the form factor to the sp statistics is introduced in ref .",
    "fit @xmath98 to the function @xmath102 if @xmath103 then function  ( [ eq : kfit ] ) is the sp form factor .",
    "we use the quantity @xmath104 to measure the difference to the sp statistics . keep in mind that @xmath105 , in general , differs from @xmath106 since it depends also on @xmath98 with @xmath107 .",

    "the smooth curve is the fit  ( [ eq : kfit ] ) with @xmath114.,width=283 ]",
    "we have shown how the scaling method can be applied to convex billiards with corners . to gain insight into the strong diffractive phenomena that appear in these systems we have studied the truncated triangle . as a result of our investigations of the diffracted field",
    "we could identify its main components .",
    "these were directly introduced in the function basis in order to obtain the spectral data of this system .",
    "evanescent waves conveniently selected and associated with the centers of diffraction ( in our case the two straight segments junction at @xmath4 ) have been successfully identified as a very efficient way to deal with these kinds of phenomena .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a great number of highly excited eigenvalues .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of high - lying energy levels in this pseudointegrable billiard .",
    "we have found that the nearest - neighbor spacing distributions , next - to - nearest spacing distributions , number variance , and the spectral form factor are roughly described by the semi - poisson ( sp ) statistics . whether the sp statistics is asymptotically",
    "the exact statistics can not be decided .",
    "we would like to thank eduardo vergini for his helpful suggestions during the writing of the manuscript . also for the ideas he gave us regarding the evanescent wave approach to diffraction at corners .",
    "moreover , we would like to thank h.  schomerus and t.  gorin for discussions .",
    "in this appendix we are going to briefly explain the scaling method  @xcite .",
    "the main point that one should have in mind is that the boundary norm can be written as a function of energy because scaling is used .",
    "if @xmath115 satisfies the helmholtz equation with eigenvalue @xmath116 and we associate with it the scaling function @xmath117 then , these functions satisfy the same equation with eigenvalue @xmath118 . if we have a billiard defined by a star - shaped domain and a @xmath119 exists such that @xmath120 at the boundary @xmath121 , then this is a scaling eigenfunction or , equivalently , an eigenfunction of the billiard with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
