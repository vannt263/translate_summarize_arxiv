    "electron pairing in a crystal has always been an interesting subject of study in quantum solid - state physics .",
    "the most remarkable pairing of electrons is cooper pair in superconductors@xcite , mediated by lattice distortions .",
    "electron pairing may also occur through strong electron - phonon coupling forming the so - call bipolaron.@xcite on the other hand , experimental observation of the pairing of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical lattice@xcite , where the binding arises from pure quantum interference , has stimulated many theoretical and experimental investigations about bound pair in strongly correlated systems in periodic potentials .",
    "quantum states of two interacting electrons with short - range interactions and possible electron paring have been studied both in one - dimensional@xcite and two - dimensional@xcite periodic potentials .",
    "very recently , by a semiclassical analysis of bloch oscillations of two electrons interacting through a coulomb potential in a biased crystal lattice , gaul et al.@xcite found that they may form a bound pair if the energy of the relative motion exceeds the upper band edge .    in this work",
    ", we will study the quantum states of two correlated electrons in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic potential from a different point of view .",
    "we observe that , in fact , localized individual electron pairs have been studied in many different quantum units such as the negative hydrogen ion h@xmath0 , helium atom@xcite , as well as two - electron quantum dot@xcite and negatively charged donor center ( d@xmath0)@xcite in solid state environment .",
    "electron - electron exchange and correlation are essential in the formation of these electron - pair states .",
    "the quantum state of the electron pair such as that of h@xmath0 is different in its nature from the single - electron state of the h atom.@xcite the locality of the electron correlation is essential in the h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 states where the correlation of two localized electrons reduces greatly the coulomb repulsion@xcite .",
    "the electron - pair state localizes closely to the positive charge of the nuclear and do not form a valence with other atoms .",
    "in contrast , the bonding ( and antibonding ) states originating from the single - electron states are fundamental in the formation of a molecule .",
    "it is well known that in a crystal the single - electron energy levels of periodically organized individual atoms form energy bands .",
    "then the question is , when those basic quantum units with strongly correlated electron pairs are organized into a periodic structure such as a crystal or a superlattice , where are the corresponding quantum states of the electron pairs ?",
    "generally , one believes that , due to strong electron - electron repulsion , these localized states of individual electron pairs can not survive in a periodic crystal or a superlattice . in the following",
    "we show that there may exist a metastable energy band of electron pair in a 2d crystal resulting from the electron - electron coulomb interaction and crystal periodic potential .",
    "our idea is to try to find out the counter part of the individual h@xmath0 ( or d@xmath0 ) electron - pair states in a 2d periodic potential .",
    "first of all , we should remember that in 2d the energy of a neutral h atom ( with a single electron ) is @xmath1 r@xmath2 and that of a h@xmath0 ( with two electrons ) is @xmath3 r@xmath2.@xcite it means that an isolated h@xmath0 is more stable than a single h atom plus one free electron of zero energy ( which is the reference for energy ) .",
    "the energy difference of @xmath4 r@xmath2 is the binding energy of the h@xmath0 state in 2d .",
    "however , if we consider many h@xmath0 or many d@xmath0 centres ( e.g. , periodically organized ) in a system , the measure should be the total energy of the system , or equivalently , the average energy per electron .",
    "then the energy difference between the h@xmath5 and h states in 2d is given by @xmath6 r@xmath2 .",
    "it indicates that in this case the h@xmath5 state is of higher energy than the h state .",
    "we intend to calculate the two - electron states in a periodic potential . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider a 2d periodic potential such as @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the period , and @xmath10 is the amplitude of the crystal potential .",
    "the single - electron states are well known in this potential . the schrdinger equation for a single electron",
    "is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wavevector in the first brillouin zone , @xmath14 is the band index , and @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) is the reciprocal - lattice vector ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the eigenvalue and eigenfunction , respectively . here",
    "the length and energy are measured in units of the effective bohr radius @xmath19 and effective rydberg @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "for a crystal with effective electron mass @xmath21 and static dielectric constant @xmath22 , one obtains a@xmath23   and r@xmath24 mev @xmath25 ev .",
    "when we consider two electrons in this periodic potential , their hamiltonian is given by @xmath26 . before solving the corresponding schrdinger equation , we should bear in mind",
    "that , due to electron - electron repulsion , the ground state of this system can be found for @xmath27 . in other words ,",
    "the ground state of two electrons in this system corresponds to two non - interacting single particles separated by an infinitely long distance .",
    "however , in a real system the electron density is not zero and , consequently , the distance between two electrons is finite . therefore , we intend to solve the relevant equation for two electrons as a function of the distance between them .",
    "the idea is to try first to find any possible metastable states of electron pairs due to the competition between the electron - electron interaction and the 2d crystal lattice potential .",
    "then we will study the stability of the electron pairs .",
    "we now introduce the center of mass and relative coordinates , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",

    "we can choose a bloch wavefunction in the center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "as to the function in the relative coordinates @xmath33 , we have to consider the symmetry of the electron - electron coulomb potential and the periodic potential representing a 2d square lattice .",
    "we use the following basis for our trial wavefunction , @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath41 , @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the generalized laguerre polynomial .",

    "the electron - pair band remains above the lowest single - electron band .",
    "their difference will be shown in the next figure .",
    "similarity between dispersion relations of the electron - pair band and the lowest single - electron band is due to the two paired electrons are closely bound in real space with a separation much less than the lattice period .    in fig .",
    "3(a ) we plot the energy per electron of the metastable pair at the @xmath55 point ( @xmath80 ) as a function of @xmath10 for different @xmath9 .",
    "we also show the maximum energy @xmath72 at the m point of the lowest single - electron band .",
    "we define the difference between these two energies as an energy gap , @xmath81 , and plot it in fig .",
    "the energy gap @xmath73 is typically a few r@xmath2 .",
    "so far we have obtained the single - particle states in the system as shown in fig .  2 , i.e. , the single - electron and single electron - pair states .",
    "for a 2d periodic potential of given @xmath10 and @xmath9 , we can obtain the energy and wavefunction of the electron pair , and consequently , the pair - pair and pair - electron ( and pair - hole ) interaction potential can also be calculated . in the following",
    ", we will consider the case in which many electrons are presented in the system .",
    "we assume the lowest single - electron band as the valence band with an electron filling factor @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath83 we can understand that holes are presented in the valence band with a hole filling factor @xmath84 .",
    "when electrons appear in the electron - pair band , we reach a many - particle system consisting of electron pairs in the @xmath55 valley of the electron - pair band and holes in the m valleys of the valence band .",
    "many - particle interactions renormalize the total energy of the system and also reduce the energy gap @xmath73 .",
    "if the band - gap renormalization due to electron - pair and hole interactions leads to a negative energy gap , in other words , if the renormalized @xmath55 valley of the electron - pair band becomes lower than the renormalized m valley of the valence band , the electron - pairs in the @xmath55 valley can become stable .",
    "band - gap renormalization ( bgr ) has been extensively studied in nonlinear optics of semiconductors , where one deals with an electron - hole plasma . in this case , the bgr is given by a sum of electron and hole self - energies and is a function of the interparticle distance @xmath85 and temperature.@xcite in a 2d electron - hole system at zero temperature , for instance , the bgr is about 8@xmath86 at @xmath87.@xcite for a high density electron - hole plasma the bgr is mainly induced by the coulomb repulsion among the particles ( the coulomb hole effect ) .",
    "the mechanism of the bgr in our present electron - pair - hole system should be similar .",
    "therefore , we believe that the bgr in our system should be of similar value as that in the electron - hole plasma . the metastable electron pairs can be stabilized in a many - particle system .",
    "this is a task for our future study .    on the other hand ,",
    "the boson - fermion model@xcite as well as two - dimensional charged boson fluids@xcite with artificially introduced bosons considered as point charges have been extensively studied over the last few decades . from the electron - pair ( boson ) states obtained in this work , we can calculate the pair - pair and pair - hole interaction potentials .",
    "consequently , one can study the ground - state properties of the present narrow - gap and multi - valley boson - fermion system with electron pairs and holes .",
    "a progress is that now the bosons ( i.e. , the electron pairs ) are obtained from the crystal band structure and they are not point charges .    in conclusion",
    ", we have obtained an electron - pair energy band in a two - dimensional crystal .",
    "the electron - pair states are metastable in the absence of other electrons in the system .",
    "the two correlated electrons are bound in the same unit cell in relative coordinates with an average separation about 1/3 of the period @xmath9 of the crystal potential .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed the possibility that the electron pairs can be stabilized in a many - particle system with electron pairs and holes . from this point of view",
    ", present work could provide an interesting platform for studying 2d charged boson - fermion fluids .",
    "the present calculations can also be carried out for a three - dimensional system .",
