    "the effects of quantum fluctuations of interacting quantum systems can be investigated by studying the correlation functions or quantifying the entanglement of the system , which are currently paid much attention .",
    "the exact evaluation of the correlation functions , however , is still a challenging problem even when models are completely integrable .",
    "the spin-1/2 xxz model in one - dimension is one of the most fundamental model , which can be exactly solved by the bethe ansatz . as concerns for the correlation functions in the _ antiferromagnetic _ ground state ,",
    "a few exact results are known so far : several short distance spin - spin correlation functions ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the ferromagnetic string formation probability ( which is the probability to find a ferromagnetic string with certain length ) for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 : anisotropy parameter ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we intensively consider the correlation functions for the _ ferromagnetic _ regime of the xxz chain . in this regime , it has been well - known that there are two translationally invariant ground states _ up _ and _ down _ , the state with all spins up and the state with all spins down .",
    "in addition to these trivial ground states , two classes of non - translationally invariant ground states _ kink _ and _ antikink _ were found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for _ finite _ xxz chain with boundary magnetic field ) .",
    "though it is not obvious that the _ kink _ is the ground state in the infinite lattice limit , the authors in @xcite proved it under the assumption that the ground states should be  frustration free \" , i.e. minimize not only the energy of the total hamiltonian , but also the energy of the local hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the  frustration free \" ground states _ up _ , _ down _ , _ kink _ and _ antikink _ are the complete set of the ground states @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the exact value of the spectral gap was obtained and shown to be independent of the reference ground state .",
    "more recently , from the interest in the correspondence between the ground state of the ferromagnetic xxz chain and the  quantum \" hamiltonian of the crystal melting model , some special correlation functions such as the magnetization and the longitudinal spin - spin correlation function of the kink ground state were exactly calculated @xcite .",
    "utilizing the generating function developed in @xcite , in this paper , we derive the exact expression of the density matrix for the kink ground state of the ferromagnetic xxz chain . by using this",
    ", various correlation functions can be systematically calculated for arbitrary interaction strengths and for arbitrary distances .",
    "the following correlation functions are particularly calculated here : the transverse and the longitudinal spin - spin correlation functions , the ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) string formation probabilities which are the probability finding a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) string in the kink ground state .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the system is also evaluated ( see @xcite for finite xxz chain with boundary magnetic field ) . analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of these correlation functions , we find that the the spin - spin correlation functions exponentially decay for the large distances . on the other hand , both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic string formation probabilities exhibit gaussian decay for large strings . to authors knowledge , this study is the first to investigate systematically the correlation functions and their asymptotics in the kink ground state .",
