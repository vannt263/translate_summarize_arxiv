    "a collection of hard spheres is one of the simplest examples of an interacting system .",
    "hard - sphere packings have been important since the dawn of civilisation @xcite , while using hard spheres to model the liquid state dates back at least to kirkwood @xcite in the 1940s .",
    "the simplicity of hard spheres lends itself to analytical theory @xcite and computer simulation.@xcite while the absence of inter - particle attraction precludes a liquid phase , concentrated hard sphere fluids capture many properties of the liquid state .",
    "@xcite due to its analytic tractability , and that it is described by just one parameter , volume fraction @xmath0 , the importance of the hard sphere system as a basic model in understanding condensed matter can not be overstated .",
    "early hard sphere experiments include bernal s use of ball bearings to model liquid structure.@xcite however , ball bearings have negligible thermal motion .",
    "suspensions of mesoscopic colloids exhibit brownian motion and are thermodynamically equivalent to atoms and small molecules @xcite . in 1986 ,",
    "pusey and van megen @xcite showed that a suspension of sterically - stabilised polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) particles showed hard - sphere - like equilibrium phase behaviour .",
    "their work led to many experimental studies of the statistical physics of hard spheres using colloids as models . since pusey and van megen s work",
    ", the equation of state of hard - sphere colloids has been determined @xcite , crystal nucleation has been observed @xcite , and the glass transition has been studied @xcite .",
    "the body of experimental research just reviewed relied on light scattering as the structural and dynamical probe .",
    "the advent of single particle tracking in real space with confocal microscopy @xcite opened a new dimension in experiments on hard - sphere - like systems , yielding an unprecedented level of detailed information @xcite .",
    "confocal microscopy of hard - sphere - like suspensions is thus ideal for studying generic processes where local events are important , such as crystal nucleation @xcite , melting @xcite and dynamical heterogeneity @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the thermodynamics of a system of hard spheres is controlled solely by the state variable @xmath0 .",
    "we have recently reviewed the experimental determination of volume fraction@xcite and concluded that , although relative values of @xmath0 may be known with high precision , absolute values can only be determined to within 3 - 6% accuracy .",
    "this matters , especially when dealing with dynamical properties ( e.g. , phase transition kinetics and the glass transition ) , since these can be very strong functions of @xmath0 .",
    "but the accurate determination of @xmath0 is only part of the experimental challenge .",
    "the other part of the challenge was hinted at by the title of pusey and van megen s 1986 paper , `` phase behaviour of concentrated suspensions of _ nearly _ hard colloidal spheres '' @xcite , where we have added the italics to emphasise the point in question , namely , that true hard spheres do not exist in reality . in pusey and van megen s case ,",
    "the lack of hardness is almost certainly due to the small but finite compressibility of the phsa stabilising ` hairs ' . the same is generically true of other sterically - stabilised particle systems .    in very - nearly - hard ,",
    "sterically - stabilised suspensions , a new sample has to be made for every state point @xmath0 . apart from being cumbersome , this also restricts the accuracy with which the sole thermodynamic control parameter can be ` tuned ' .",
    "thus , there has been a drive to use particles such as ` microgels ' , whose diameter is temperature dependent . since temperature , @xmath2 , can be tuned far more accurately than @xmath0 , this allows the scanning of a single sample very finely through @xmath0 space by varying @xmath2 .",
    "but the price paid for the ` tunability ' of particle diameter is that some softness is built in by design .     and",
    "the core - shell diameter @xmath3 are needed for a full characterisation .",
    "( b ) microgel particle , which is a heavily cross - linked polymer .",
    "( c ) charged colloid , where the electrical double layer ( shaded ) gives rise to an effective diameter @xmath4.,width=302 ]    to understand a final reason why real model hard - sphere colloids may be somewhat soft , consider why in practice , not only @xmath0 but the particle diameter @xmath5 matters .",
    "experimentally , colloids as synthesised are usually not matched in density to the dispersing medium .",
    "significant sedimentation ( or , less usually , creaming ) during the timescale of an experiment therefore presents a problem . in light scattering studies ,",
    "this is circumvented to a large extent by the use of small particles , say , @xmath6 nm , so that for pmma particles dispersed in cis - decalin , a single particle sediments @xmath7 mm per day . the middle part of a bulk sample would therefore be little affected by sedimentation over a day .",
    "but if one wants to eliminate the effect all together ( e.g. for long - time measurements ) , or when larger particles ( say , @xmath8 nm ) are needed for imaging purposes , then solvent mixtures for density matching are needed , which often introduces significant charging .",
    "the practical need for larger particles therefore inevitably brings softness .    in this second part of our review",
    ", we survey critically these three sources of softness in experimental systems of colloids that have been used to model hard spheres , fig .",
    "[ figrealhard ] . in the spirit of the first part of our review @xcite",
    ", we seek to provide a means by which the hardness may be assessed , and consider the consequences this may have on the behaviour of the system .",
    "likewise , we argue for more clarity on the part of experimentalists , concerning the softness of the systems they use .",
    "we also suggest a number of criteria by which experimentalists ( and theorists using experimental data ) may judge whether a certain system of colloids may be considered ` hard enough ' for answering particular physics questions .",
    "below , we first discuss mapping experimental systems onto hard spheres via measuring the inter - particle potential in section [ sectionmapping ] .",
    "we then treat softness of non - electrostatic origins in section [ sectionintrinsic ] and of electrostatic origins in section [ sectionelectrostatics ] ; in general , both effects are present simultaneously .",
    "finally we give a worked example in section [ sectioncasestudy ] , illustrating many of the points raised throughout this review , before concluding in section [ sectionconclusions ] .",
    "given that real colloids inevitably display a degree of softness , it is important to be able to map their behaviour to that of hard spheres for the purpose of comparison with theories and simulations of perfect hard spheres . by mapping , we mean finding an effective hard - sphere diameter @xmath4 so that one may map from the experimentally - controllable particle number density @xmath9 to an effective hard - sphere volume fraction @xmath10 using @xmath11 .",
    "there are two conceptually distinct ways of determining @xmath12 .",
    "first , one could map via some known hard - sphere property , such as the volume fraction at freezing ( @xmath13 ) , or the viscosity of the suspension as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this class of methods have been reviewed in detail in the first part of our review.@xcite here we concentrate on a second class of methods : determining @xmath4 from the inter - particle potential , @xmath14 .",
    "to do so , of course , requires means of measuring @xmath14 , which is the main topic of this section .",
    "first , however , we briefly review how a knowledge of @xmath14 can be used to determine an effective hard - sphere diameter , @xmath4 .",
    "perhaps the simplest approach is to set an effective hard sphere diameter @xmath15 such that the inter - particle repulsive energy at this centre - to - centre separation between two particles is equal to the thermal energy , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17",
    ". a more sophisticated approach , which distinguishes between different potentials with the same @xmath15 , is to use the barker - henderson effective hard sphere diameter@xcite @xmath18 . \\label{eqbh}\\ ] ] other , yet more sophisticated mappings , exist , such as that due to andersen , weeks , and chandler @xcite ; this approximation is known to work well for mapping the static properties of liquids and more recently structural relaxation time near the glass transition @xcite . all of these approaches rely on knowing @xmath14 .",
    "we now review methods for gaining this knowledge .",
    "a host of sophisticated techniques are now available for direct measurement of colloidal forces ; integration of the measured force - distance relationship then gives @xmath14 .    in the case of pmma particles",
    "sterically stablised by poly-12-hydroxyl steric acid ( phsa ) ` hairs ' , the interaction may be inferred via the direct measurement of the interaction potential between mica surfaces coated by phsa using the surface - force apparatus .",
    "the results were well described by an inverse power law , suggesting a reasonably ( but _ not _ absolutely ) hard interaction @xcite ; see section [ sectionintrinsic ] for more details .",
    "other methods for measuring colloidal interactions directly include total internal reflection microscopy , which measures the force between a colloid and a glass wall,@xcite and atomic force microscopy with a colloid on the tip of the cantilever.@xcite the interaction between two non - index - matched colloids confined to a line can be measured by optical tweezers.@xcite    one attraction of such direct methods is that no _ a priori _ assumption need be made about @xmath14 .",
    "however , their use requires care .",
    "thus , e.g. , in the case of optical tweezers , relatively small and subtle experimental errors can lead to the wrong _ sign _ of the interaction between charged colloids  @xcite .      for a colloid at volume fraction @xmath0 ,",
    "the inter - particle potential , @xmath14 , uniquely determines the system s pair correlation function , @xmath19 , or , equivalently , the structure factor @xmath20 , which is essentially the fourier transform of @xmath19 . determining @xmath19 or @xmath20 from a given @xmath14 is , of course , one of the classical problems of liquid state theory.@xcite in principle , it is also possible to reverse this procedure , and infer @xmath14 from measured correlation functions .",
    "the inversion of @xmath20 to obtain @xmath14 has a long history in liquid state physics , and has also been used for colloids.@xcite a fundamental difficulty with this approach is that , like all inverse problems , this one is ill - conditioned . essentially , many different forms of interaction can give rise to the same @xmath20 . for our purposes , it is instructive to bear in mind that the @xmath20 for the inert gases near their respective triple temperatures can be well fitted to the hard - sphere @xmath20 at an appropriate @xmath0 , even though the inter - particular potential under the same conditions is well approximated by a lennard - jones form : @xmath21 , which includes an attractive part , and a repulsive part that is very far from ` hard ' .",
    "inverting the real - space pair correlation function , @xmath19 , can also give the interaction potential,@xcite and is subject to the same ambiguities , especially when many - body effects are present.@xcite but if @xmath19 can be measured in the limit of vanishing @xmath0 , then the inversion to give @xmath14 is unique:@xcite @xmath22 . \\label{eqard}\\ ] ] this approach has become possible with the advent of real - space techniques , which allows the determination of @xmath19 by direct counting . @xcite in the limit represented by eq .  [ eqard ] , monodisperse hard spheres give a perfect step function form for @xmath19 , but polydispersity and particle tracking errors would blur the sharpness of the edge at @xmath23 , as would a small degree of softness . in fig .",
    "[ figg ] , we show the @xmath19 measured in this limit for a putative hard - sphere suspension.@xcite it is immediately clear that these particles can not , in fact , be hard spheres .",
    "the peak in the dilute - limit @xmath19 is due to a short - range inter - particle attraction . for dilute hard spheres",
    "gives a featureless @xmath24 .",
    "residual attraction or softness therefore shows up much more obviously in real space . ]",
    "computer simulations can be used to fit the measured dilute - limit @xmath19 using a square - well attraction for @xmath14 ; importantly , however , a distribution of particle sizes as well as random tracking errors ( both modelled by gaussians ) are essential to obtain a good fit .",
    "interestingly , it has been argued@xcite that eq .",
    "( [ eqard ] ) remains a remarkably accurate approximation at finite but modest @xmath0 .",
    "the solid line is computer simulation data with particle tracking errors and polydispersity added , for a square well attraction of depth @xmath25 and range @xmath26.,width=188 ]      the application of eq .",
    "[ eqard ] makes no _ a priori _ assumption about the form of @xmath14 , and can therefore be applied to any system . for charged systems , if the inter - particle potential is modelled using , e.g. dlvo theory ( for which see section [ sectionelectrostatics ] ) , then one could access @xmath14 via measuring the parameters of this theory , viz . , an effective charge on the particles , @xmath27 , and the ionic strength of the solvent .",
    "the definition and therefore determination of @xmath27 is highly non - trivial,@xcite and the deduction of ionic strength from conductivity measurements in non - aqueous solvents depends on a number of assumptions@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , reasonable results can be obtained @xcite .",
    "all of these methods have limitations .",
    "those based on particle tracking methods ( optical tweezers and extraction from real space ) are limited by the accuracy with which the particle coordinates can be tracked , typically 30 - 100 nm , or up to @xmath28 for a @xmath29 @xmath30 m particle .",
    "moreover , there is evidence that tracking errors on two closely approaching colloids may tend more to the point of contact , rather than being uniformly distributed.@xcite furthermore , averaging over many particles in an inevitably polydisperse sample effectively adds a further error to the measurements.@xcite comparison with simulations can be used to compensate for some of these errors , though this avenue has been little explored to date .",
    "finally , at higher concentrations,@xcite and in reciprocal space , one needs to make prior assumptions about the form of the inter - particle potential that one wants to determine in the first place.@xcite accurate measurement of @xmath14 is therefore far from straightforward .",
    "we now turn to review softness in model hard - sphere systems of non - electrostatic origin .",
    "there are two generic sources of such ` intrinsic ' softness : steric stabilisation , and the use of particles with temperature - tuneable size .",
    "nm , ( b ) @xmath31 nm . in both parts ,",
    "light pink lines denote @xmath32 , the interaction due to the steric stabilisation .",
    "the dashed blue line in each case represents unscreened weak electrostatic interactions in low dielectric constant solvents ( cis - decalin / tce ) calculated for effective charges @xmath33 and @xmath34 for ( a ) and ( b ) respectively and a debye length of @xmath35 nm .",
    "the solid blue line represents typical screened electrostatic interactions : ( a ) in water ( charge @xmath36 and debye length @xmath37 nm ) , and ( b ) a density matching mixture of cis decalin and cxb ( charge @xmath38 and debye length @xmath39 nm ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    a sterically - stabilised particle is shown schematically in fig . [ figrealhard](a ) .",
    "we have previously@xcite reviewed ways to arrive at an effective hard sphere diameter for these particles via mapping to various hard - sphere properties .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ subsectiondirect ] , such mapping is also possible via direct measurement of colloidal forces .",
    "this has been done for phsa - stabilised pmma particles ; the measurements are quite well described by an inverse power law potential with energy scale @xmath40:@xcite @xmath41 the relative range of @xmath42 depends on the particle size , for example @xmath43 for particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of @xmath44 nm particles , and increases with particle diameter .",
    "likewise the strength of the interaction also depends on the particle size , with @xmath45 @xmath46 for @xmath44 nm . the results of bryant _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are replotted in fig .",
    "these quantify what is intuitively obvious , namely , that for a fixed length of stabilising ` hairs ' , larger particles are relatively harder .",
    "one main motivation to use soft particles to model hard spheres is that the diameter , and therefore concentration , of these colloids may be temperature tuneable .",
    "the most popular systems here are microgel particles . as cross - linked polymer coils ,",
    "their swelling is related to solvent quality , with the precise degree of swelling controlled by the cross - linking density .",
    "there are two varieties : ` neutral ' microgels , in which a low amount of charges is screened by added salt or is so small as to be negligible , and ionic microgels , which carry ( much more ) electrostatic charge , for which see section [ sectionelectrostatics ] .",
    "few analytic expressions for microgel - microgel interactions exist .",
    "expressions for polymer - covered flat surfaces have been suggested as a first approximation @xcite .",
    "the steric interactions between neutral microgels have been likened to crosslinked polymers , so that a form for the interaction can be obtained provided the density profile of the particle is known.@xcite additional interactions in ionic microgels do have analytic forms @xcite , which can be added to the steric repulsion , for which an inverse power form is often assumed .",
    "irrespective of the absence of well - attested analytical forms for the inter - particle repulsion , swellable colloidal microgels are definitely not hard , and the degree of swelling depends sensitively on the experimental conditions , including possibly the concentration of microgel particles .",
    "if the latter is a significant effect , then any @xmath10 would become state - dependent .",
    "we now review a popular system , dispersions of poly ( @xmath47-isopropylacrylamid ) ( pnipam ) microgel particles,@xcite for which water is a poor solvent at @xmath48c , so that at and above this temperature , the diameter of the particles in an aqueous environment dramatically shrinks . changing the amount of the cross - linker @xmath47,@xmath49-methylenbisacrylamide tunes how much shrinkage occurs.@xcite sufficiently monodisperse samples crystallise at high volume fractions , giving crystals",
    "whose structure has been variously reported as face - centred cubic@xcite or as consisting of the more or less random stacking of hexagonally - packed layers.@xcite richtering and co - workers have examined the physical properties of pnipam microgel suspensions with a variety of probes and discussed their findings in terms of possible mapping onto hard spheres .",
    "we mention three aspects .",
    "first , neutron scattering shows that an individual particle has a constant - density core , surrounded by a corona in which the density gradually decreases to zero over a distance that is approximately twice that of the core.@xcite from this finding alone , we expect the particles to be significantly soft .",
    "next , the structure factors of pnipam suspensions at progressively higher particle concentrations have been measured , and compared to that of hard spheres.@xcite using two different methods of data analysis , it was concluded that the @xmath20 of these suspensions could be described adequately within a hard - sphere framework by assigning @xmath10 ( or , equivalently , @xmath4 ) to the particles at concentrations @xmath50 . above this concentration ,",
    "increasingly large deviations from hard - sphere - like behaviour were observed .",
    "interestingly , in a later paper,@xcite the same group points out that the mapping to hard - spheres at @xmath10 was obtained by making one of two assumptions : either that a hard - sphere structure factor ( from percus - yevick theory ) in fact fitted the data , or that the form factor of a single particle@xcite determined in the low - concentration limit did not change when the microgel concentration was increased , which is not self - evidently true .    finally , richtering and coworkers investigated the fluid - crystal coexistence gap.@xcite in one study of pnipam particles dispersed in water,@xcite",
    "a @xmath51 was determined by requiring agreement with the hard - sphere expression for suspension viscosity at low concentrations , @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the solvent viscosity ) .",
    "this procedure is problematic because of the aforementioned state - dependence of @xmath4 ( and therefore of @xmath10 ) .",
    "nevertheless , using this mapping , the fluid - solid coexistence gap was found to be @xmath54 , i.e. it occurs at significantly higher concentrations than that in hard spheres ( @xmath55 ) , and is substantially narrower ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "comparison with simulations@xcite of the freezing of particles interacting via a power - law repulsion @xmath58 gives @xmath59 for pnipam particles with @xmath60 nm .",
    "this is considerably softer than the inter - particle potential found@xcite for sterically - stabilised particle of comparable size ( @xmath61 nm ) , which can be characterised by a power law with exponent @xmath43 .",
    "a different mapping was used in a second study of fluid - crystal coexistence,@xcite in which the the microgel particles are now dispersed in dimethylformamide ( dmf , a good solvent chosen for refractive index matching ) .",
    "the freezing concentration of the microgel particles expressed in mass fraction , @xmath62 , was converted to an effective hard - sphere volume fraction by a multiplicative factor , @xmath63 , where the ` swelling ratio ' @xmath64 was chosen to yield a freezing volume fraction of @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , this procedure gave @xmath66 for the point at which 100% crystallisation should occur , consistent with hard - sphere behaviour .",
    "this agrees with the findings by another group of a recent imaging study using larger pnipam particles dispersed in aqueous medium , @xcite but contrasting strikingly with the previous finding by the same group of a significantly narrower coexistence gap.@xcite the same study found that the collective diffusion of these microgel particles dispersed in dmf and their hydrodynamic interactions could _ not _ be well described by any mapping to hard spheres .",
    "these studies illustrate some of the difficulties associated with mapping microgels to hard spheres .",
    "an additional issue is that of polydispersity .",
    "both softness in the inter - particle potential@xcite and polydispersity@xcite affect the width of the coexistence gap , so that the effect of these two quite distinct physical factors may be difficult to disentangle .",
    "fortunately , microgels can be synthesised with polydispersities as low as @xmath67 before swelling , so that perhaps the polydispersity effect can be neglected in the first approximation ( cf .",
    "the very small effect 1% polydispersity on the miscibility gap of hard spheres@xcite ) .    a variant of the ` canonical ' microgel has been synthesised and characterised by ballauff and co - workers@xcite consisting of a hard polystyrene core onto which is grafted a network of cross - linked pnipam , so that the swollen shell has approximately the same dimensions as the core radius ( @xmath68  nm ) .",
    "to determine @xmath10 , a core volume fraction @xmath69 was first measured by conversion from the particle mass fraction using the density of polystyrene .",
    "the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles , @xmath70 was then determined using dynamic light scattering ; this was later confirmed to be very close to the diameter of the outer corona visible in cryo - transmission electron microscopy ( cryo - tem ) images,@xcite which also gave the core diameter @xmath71 , and the polydispersity of the core - shell diameter distribution ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "finally , using @xmath73 , the fluid - crystal coexistence gap at 21@xmath74c was found at @xmath75 , which is , within experimental uncertainties , very close to the hard - sphere interval of 0.494 to 0.545 .",
    "it is interesting to analyse these findings further .",
    "as the authors themselves@xcite have pointed out , if @xmath76 is rescaled to exactly 0.494 , then melting occurs at 0.556 .",
    "this gives a coexistence gap wider than in perfect hard spheres .",
    "if this does not reflect experimental errors , then the situation is somewhat unusual  the most common ` culprits ' , polydispersity and softness in the repulsive potential , both _",
    "narrow _ the coexistence gap [ fig .",
    "[ figmiscibility ] ( a ) and ( b ) ] . however , short - range attraction in the potential has the opposite effect of widening the coexistence gap if the polydispersity is low enough@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , 9% polydisperse hard spheres should be at or beyond the experimental limit of crystallisation,@xcite probably due to the onset of multiple solid phase coexistence in the phase diagram,@xcite which requires long - range particle motion for fractionation .",
    "that crystallisation was still observed in these pnipam samples to give a coexistence gap wider than that of hard - spheres underlines the the lack of complete understanding of microgel physics .",
    "more recently , ballauff and co - workers studied in detail the rheology of a 17% polydisperse suspension of their core - shell particles at and near the glass transition ( found to occur at @xmath77 ) , and compared their data with mode - coupling theory ( mct ) calculations for hard spheres.@xcite at this polydispersity crystallisation was inhibited , but this introduced an extra level of complexity into calculating @xmath10 .",
    "the authors relied on the fact that the high - frequency viscosity had been found to be relatively insensitive to polydispersity,@xcite and mapped the high polydisperse system onto a less polydisperse system in which @xmath10 had already been calibrated according to the procedure explained above .",
    "a large measurement of agreement with mct predictions has been found .",
    "we note in this connection that the comparison with mct mostly relies on a relative measure of the distance to the glass transition @xmath78 : @xmath79 , so that the work is perhaps less vulnerable to systematic or statistical uncertainties in arriving at @xmath10 .",
    "in the spectrum of hard to soft colloids , microgels occupy a middle niche . towards the soft end of this spectrum , we encounter star polymers ;",
    "when the number of ` arms ' ( or  functionality , @xmath80 ) is high enough , these can be considered soft colloids , with decreasing softness as @xmath80 increases .",
    "thus , for example , stars with @xmath81 are predicted to crystallise @xcite .",
    "but the structures of the crystal phases differ from the crystals nucleated from hard spheres ( random stacking of hexagonal layers ) .",
    "moreover , the effective potential between two particles at close approach is logarithmic,@xcite which is significantly softer than the power - law forms encountered in this review so far .",
    "thus , although in a mixture of ( large ) hard colloids and ( smaller ) star polymers , 32-arm stars were found to behave almost hard - sphere like vis -  - vis the hard colloids,@xcite it is unlikely that pure star polymer suspensions can be used as models of hard spheres .",
    "it is now generally accepted that immersion of a colloid in a liquid medium _ always _ gives rise to some degree of charging of the particles .",
    "this is a potential source of softness that should always be considered in experiments . if charged groups are present on the surface of the particles , entropy inevitably favours at least a certain degree of dissociation",
    "; even when charged surface groups are absent , adsorption of charged species from the medium will give rise to charged particles .",
    "the treatment of electrostatic interactions on the mean - field , or linearised poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) , level is largely adequate for our purposes .",
    "this is especially true for non - aqueous systems,@xcite in which the energetic penalty of ionisation is high , so that ion densities are low , and multivalent ions can be safely neglected .",
    "the linearised pb theory is incorporated into the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory@xcite to describe the interaction between charged colloids .",
    "the original dlvo potential consists of van der waals ( vdw ) and electrostatic components .",
    "we are primarily interested in situations in which sterically - stabilised particles become charged , so we will assume that the steric repulsion is adequate to render the vdw component negligible . instead , we will consider an inter - particle potential consisting of a steric repulsion , @xmath32 , and an electrostatic interaction , which in linearised pb theory has an yukawa form , @xmath82 : @xmath83   } { r/\\sigma_c}.\\label{eqyuk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the contact potential given by @xmath84 where , @xmath27 is the colloid charge , and the inverse debye screening length is given by @xmath85=@xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the number density of monovalent ions .",
    "the bjerrum length @xmath88 is the distance at which the interaction energy between two electronic charges is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the electronic charge , @xmath91 the permittivity of free space , and @xmath92 the dielectric constant .",
    "while this form of the electrostatic interaction is only valid in the range that linearised pb theory holds ( weak electrostatic interactions ) , higher charging can also be treated with a yukawa interaction by using a _ renormalised _ charge that is smaller than the physical charge on the particles.@xcite      water has an unusually large zero - frequency dielectric constant , @xmath93 at around room temperature , giving a bjerrum length of 0.7 nm . since @xmath94 is comparable to the size of small ions , many ionic salts are readily soluble in water .",
    "this in turn means that the debye length is easily controlled down to a few nanometres . for @xmath95 nm and @xmath36 in water with a @xmath96 nm , eqs .",
    "[ eqyuk ] , [ eqepsilonyuk ] and eqs .",
    "[ eqkt ] and [ eqbh ] give @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "thus , screened charged colloids in water very often approximate hard spheres reasonably if they are either sterically stabilised or the short @xmath99 is still large enough to render vdw attractions irrelevant . nevertheless , some aspects of the behaviour of such colloids may still be non - hard - sphere - like .",
    "thus , piazza  _ _ et al.__@xcite found that , although the equation of state ( eos ) of their screened charged colloids approximated the hard sphere eos at moderate to high @xmath0 , at low @xmath0 , the barometric distribution in the earth s gravitational field , @xmath100 , was _ not _ observed , with the measured height distribution showing a more slowly decaying ` tail ' .",
    "this is related to a decoupling of ions and colloids , leading to a macroscopic electric field @xcite .      .",

    "it was therefore a long - held assumption that electrostatics could be safely neglected .",
    "however , the work of the van blaaderen group  @xcite and others have shown that some electrostatic charging _ always _ occurs .",

    "thus , the system used by pusey and van megen,@xcite sterically - stabilised pmma ( @xmath106 nm ) in a mixture of cis - decalin and carbon disulphide ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 nm ) , can be expected to be charged to some extent , as later work on a similar suspension seems to confirm.@xcite    nevertheless , when the particles are small enough , such charging can often be ignored .",
    "figure [ figu](a ) ( dashed red line ) shows @xmath82 for a charge of @xmath33 on the surface of @xmath44  nm particles ( corresponding to @xmath105 ) in a dispersion medium with a debye length of @xmath109 m .",
    "the measured steric repulsion for sterically - stabilised pmma particles of this size@xcite is also shown .",
    "it is clear that for all relevant length scales in this situation , @xmath110 .",
    "these particles can plausibly be considered hard spheres .",
    "the most popular hard - sphere model system to date for confocal microscopy is sterically - stabilised pmma , because of the possibility of using a solvent mixture for simultaneous refractive index and density matching . for accurate determination of coordinates , particles with @xmath111 m are required .",
    "the density - matching solvents used are typically halogenated hydrocarbons .",
    "the use of these solvents has a number of undesirable side effects .",
    "they tend to swell the particles much more aggressively than non - halogenated hydrocarbons , and they can damage the fluorescent dye molecules included in the particles for laser confocal microscopy .",
    "they also lead to significant leves of electrostatic charging .",
    "four commonly used halogenated solvents are cycloheptyl bromide ( chb ) , cyclohexyl bromide ( cxb ) , tetrachloroethylene ( tce ) , and carbon tetrachloride . in these low dielectric constant solvents ( e.g. ,",
    "@xmath112 for cxb ) , colloids suitable for confocal microscopy ( @xmath113 @xmath30 m ) acquire a charge of @xmath114 .",
    "the debye length in a density - matching cxb - cis decalin mixture can run to microns as the ionic strength ( due predominantly to solvent self - dissociation ) can be as low as @xmath115 m , @xcite which is much lower than the ionic concentration in pure water ( @xmath116 m ) .    the charge on the colloid , although much lower than what can be expected on similar sized particles in water , is now almost unscreened , which can lead to very long - ranged and strong interactions ( @xmath117100 @xmath46 ) .",
    "these interactions can and do vary from sample to sample , as the ionic strength in cxb and chb varies from batch to batch , and as a function of time.@xcite colloidal crystallization has been found in some cases@xcite at @xmath118 ( as compared to hard spheres at @xmath119 ) , but at least one experiment saw crystallization at volume fractions as low as @xmath120;@xcite often these crystals were body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) in contrast to hard - sphere crystals which are random - hexagonal - close - packed ( rhcp ) or fcc .",
    "furthermore , for some batches of cxb , the colloid charge can change with particle concentration , leading to strongly @xmath0-dependent interactions , and even to re - entrant melting.@xcite the use of pmma particles in halogenated solvents for confocal microscopy is therefore problematic .",
    "the situation can be improved somewhat by the use of salts to screen the charges .",
    "the problem with this approach is that salts soluble in these solvent mixtures such as tetrabutyl ammonium bromide ( tbab)@xcite are soluble only to around 260 nm.@xcite this results in a debye length of @xmath121  nm . although this is substantially less the diameter of imageable colloids ( @xmath111 m ) , it is not negligible and a noticeable degree of softness will likely result , fig . [ figu](b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the majority of ions now come from the salt , the ionic strength and therefore the colloid - colloid effective interactions will likely be reasonably independent of @xmath0 .",
    "another possibility is to use lower dielectric constant solvents such as tce and ccl@xmath122 ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively ) .",
    "lower @xmath125 increases @xmath94 , eq .  [ eqbjerrum ] .",
    "the rule of thumb for estimating the degree of charging , viz . , @xmath126 , therefore predicts a lower @xmath27 .",
    "however , both of these solvents are strongly absorbed by pmma , and can lead to a volume swelling of @xmath127%.@xcite unless the swelling is very closely monitored and characterised , it becomes a serious source of potentially large systematic errors,@xcite because @xmath128 .",
    "solvent absorption also increases the density and refractive index of the particles .",
    "thus , one of the initial attractions of using such halogenated solvents is lost - without swelling , adding one of these solvents can density match nearly exactly but also ( fortuitously ) nearly match the refractive index . with significant absorption ,",
    "more tce ( say ) than is needed for index matching has to be added to achieve density matching . unless a third solvent is used to re - achieve index matching ( which itself may need to further swelling ) , a turbid sample results .",
    "such turbidity not only degrades image quality , but can also give rise to significant vdw attraction .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ figg ] , which shows the measured @xmath19 of a @xmath129 suspension of sterically - stabilised pmma particles in a density - matching mixture of cis - decalin and tce.@xcite the pronounced peak at touching immediately alerts us to the presence of inter - particle attraction , as simulations confirm .",
    "since a well - attested analytical form for the interaction between charged colloids is available , eqs .",
    "( [ equ])-([eqbjerrum ] ) , we close by presenting an ` exact ' comparison between the simulated phase behaviour of such particles , fig .",
    "[ figmiscibility ] , and various ways of mapping their behaviour to hard spheres .",
    "this comparison illustrates how careful one must be in drawing conclusions from such mapping , even in the limit when inevitable experimental uncertainties ( e.g. due to polydispersity or slightly soft steric - stabilising ` hairs ' ) are negligible .",
    "consider charged hard spheres , so that @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ equ ] ) is the perfect hard - sphere repulsion .",
    "we model scenarios that may reasonably represent sterically - stabilised pmma used in confocal imaging , and take @xmath130  @xmath30 m , and a debye screening length of @xmath131  nm ( so that @xmath132 ) .",
    "the latter is a round figure chosen to correspond roughly to cxb with the maximum possible amount of dissolved tbab ( 260  nm ) . consider two colloid charges @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the former is consistent with the rule of thumb , @xmath135 , while the latter is 5 times lower than predicted by this empirical relation .",
    "these charges have been reported in different studies@xcite for nominally identical pmma particles used for confocal imaging dispersed in a density - matching mixture of cis - decalin and cxb .",
    "equation ( [ eqyuk ] ) gives @xmath136 and @xmath137 for these two charges respectively .",

    "these are delimited by red lines in fig .",
    "[ figmapping ] for ( a ) @xmath38 and ( b ) @xmath139 .",
    "note first that these values of not - very - large surface charge , variously reported in the literature for nominally very similar pmma colloids , in fact pertain to rather large differences in the freezing / melting transitions , both in terms of absolute values of the transitions points and in terms of width of the coexistence region .",
    "thus , some kind of ` mapping ' is clearly necessary if we are to use either system to model hard spheres meaningfully .",
    "we proceed to calculate @xmath4 for the particles represented by these two parameter sets using either eq .",
    "( [ eqkt ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eqbh ] ) , and eqs .",
    "( [ equ])-([eqbjerrum ] ) .",
    "if mapping is to be helpful , we should expect that once we have transformed @xmath0 to @xmath10 , freezing and melting of the two system should occur at approximately the hard - sphere values , viz .",
    ", 0.494 and 0.545 .    fig .",
    "[ figmapping](a ) shows that for the case @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ eqkt ] ) predicts freezing at @xmath140 , just 0.010 from the ` correct ' value .. @xcite .",
    "] however , the width of the coexistence gap is reduced , which is the result of the softness of the screened electrostatic ( yukawa ) repulsion .",
    "since the mapping involves scaling @xmath0 by constant , @xmath141 , it preserves the _ relative _ coexistence gap , so that the melting concentration , @xmath142 is significantly underestimated .",
    "conversely , the barker - henderson treatment gives a relatively accurate estimate of @xmath143 , but rather significantly overestimates @xmath142 .",
    "in the case of @xmath139 , since @xmath144 , @xmath145 , so that eq .",
    "( [ eqkt ] ) maps perfectly onto hard spheres . in this case",
    ", the barker - henderson approach does the worse job , even when compared to the raw ( unmapped ) coexistence gap given by simulations of the bare yukawa interaction .",
    "we note that since the coexistence gap varies with the interaction , mapping to the true hard sphere volume fraction at freezing inevitably gives an erroneous melting volume fraction unless the colloids are absolutely hard .",
    "figure [ figmapping ] therefore shows that the different methods of mapping to hard spheres do _ not _ give the same result . in practice , of course , the inter - particle potential is _ not _ exactly known , and polydispersity is inevitable .",
    "what is clear from the worked example summarised in fig .",
    "[ figmapping ] is that even in the ` ideal ' case of monodisperse spheres with an exactly - known inter - particle interaction , mapping to hard spheres is system- and approach - specific . in practice ,",
    "of course , polydispersity introduces significant uncertainties , and the debye length is often not determinable to high accuracy .",
    "moreover , we stress that the values of @xmath38 and @xmath139 are taken from experiments on _ nominally identical _ systems .",
    "thus , conclusions derived from any ` mapping to hard spheres ' , e.g. comparison of nucleation rates at nominally equivalent state points in the coexistence gap , must be treated with significant caution .",
    "we set out on a quest for colloids that mimic as closely as possible the ideal hard sphere .",
    "it seems that , to date , small ( say @xmath146 nm ) sterically pmma particles dispersed in index - matched hydrocarbons come about as close as possible to this ideal .",
    "larger pmma particles suitable for confocal microscopy require density matching to minimise sedimentation ; but the solvents used inevitably induce a degree of charging that is difficult to screen out entirely using salts .",
    "the resulting soft , screened coulomb inter - particle repulsion can be satisfactorily modelled on the mean - field level , however the interaction parameters vary hugely for nominally identical systems .",
    "the use of microgels such as pnipam , either on their own or as ` shells ' on hard ` cores ' , has become popular , because their volume fraction can conveniently be tuned by temperature .",
    "their inevitably soft mutual interaction has proven harder to model in a generic , analytical form . in both cases , the softness necessitates the use of a @xmath10 to map onto hard spheres .",
    "we have reviewed various ways of performing this mapping , with or without the benefit of knowledge of the inter - particle potential @xmath14 .",
    "none seem entirely satisfactory .",
    "we end by making two further observations .",
    "first , we widen the scope of our enquiry from charged particles and microgels to other kinds of non - hard inter - particle interaction , and ask what requirements should be satisfied before one may fruitfully embark on the exercise of ` mapping ' to hard spheres .",
    "we suggest the the minimum conditions to be satisfied are : + ( 1 ) the absence of any attractive interaction , so that the equilibrium physics is dominated by entropic effects ; + ( 2 ) crystals in a sufficiently monodisperse dispersion at high concentrations consist of the stacking of hexagonal layers .",
    "+ the first criterion highlights the importance of refractive index matching to minimise the ubiquitous vdw interaction .",
    "the second criterion explains why charged hard particles with @xmath147 , fig .",
    "[ figmiscibility ] , and microgels@xcite are suitable candidates for mapping to hard spheres , but star polymers are not.@xcite    secondly and finally , we point out that new developments in particle synthesis may yet produce @xmath30m - sized colloids that can be index _ and _ density matched using solvents or solvent mixtures that do not bring about charging and minimal swelling",
    ". such development will be most welcome for the community of scientists wishing to use colloids to test fundamental theories of many - body physics via the hard - sphere model system .",
    "of course , soft particles , from microgels to star polymers and beyond , are fascinating systems in their own right.@xcite furthermore , it is reasonable to enquire how much deviation from perfect hard spheres is acceptable , and the answer of course depends on what one wishes to study . section [ sectioncasestudy ] shows that the location of colloidal phase boundaries can vary in nontrivial and qualitative ways from hard spheres .",
    "however , it is plausible that slight softening may only have slight changes in , for example , the structural relaxation time @xcite .    our point , then ,",
    "is that while particle interaction details may not matter in some cases ( such as the pair structure of dense liquids ) , there are plenty of cases where the behaviour of the system depends strongly on both the volume fraction @xmath0 _ and _ the interparticle interactions , therefore accurate knowledge of the both is essential .",
    "crucially , the interactions may well be known to even less precision that the absolute volume fraction @xmath0 , which we have already argued is knowable only to 3 - 6% .",
