    "the general question whether @xmath2 has a ( possibly square free ) gorenstein initial ideal has been discussed recently by several authors for classical families of ideals , see @xcite .    in particular , a positive answer is given for important classes of classical ideals :",
    "ideals of minors @xcite , ideals of pfaffians @xcite and plcker relations @xcite . in these examples",
    "the associated gorenstein initial ideals are actually square - free and the corresponding simpicial complexes have a beautiful combinatorial descriptions .",
    "indeed , they provide a link to the theory of ( multi)-associahedra and to generalized cluster complexes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath6 $ ] be the polynomial ring in the variables @xmath7 over a field @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath8 we set @xmath9 and consider the generic @xmath10 symmetric matrix @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 we denote by @xmath13 the ideal generated by the @xmath14-minors of @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that @xmath16 is a cohen - macaulay normal domain and that it is gorenstein if and only if @xmath17 is even , see @xcite .",
    "it is proved in @xcite and in @xcite that the @xmath14-minors of @xmath15 are a grbner bases with respect to the lexicographic order induced by @xmath18 the corresponding initial ideal is square - free and cohen - macaulay and it is even the stanley - reisner ideal of a shellable simplicial complex .",
    "but , apart from few exceptions ( @xmath19 ) , these initial ideals are not gorenstein because they do not have the right number of  cone points \" , see @xcite for details .",
    "on the other hand , a gorenstein square free initial ideal of @xmath20 has been given in @xcite and ( implicitly ) in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to treat the case of the ideal @xmath21 of minors of size @xmath22 of a symmetric matrix of variables of size @xmath10 . in the remaining cases , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath17",
    "even , we have not been able to identify a gorenstein initial ideal for @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , we do not even have a guess .    returning to the case @xmath24",
    ", we will actually prove that the minors of size @xmath22 of @xmath15 form a grbner basis of the ideal @xmath21 with respect to a suitable reverse lexicographic order @xmath25 and that the corresponding initial ideal @xmath26 is square - free and gorenstein .",
    "furthermore , we will show in section [ r - covered ] that the simplicial complex associated to @xmath26 is the boundary complex of a cyclic polytope .",
    "typically the betti numbers of initial ideals are bigger than the betti numbers of the original ideal , and this happens also for determinantal ideals whose initial ideal is gorenstein , see for instance the examples in @xcite .",
    "this behaviour can be explained theoretically , at least for minors of order @xmath27 , using the logarithmic bounds for the regularity of a quadratic monomial ideals with first linear syzygies established in @xcite .    in our case however , it turns out that the betti numbers of @xmath21 and @xmath26 actually coincide .",
    "the reason is that the betti numbers of a compressed graded gorenstein @xmath28-algebra of even regularity just depend on the regularity and the codimension , see [ compressed ] . by observing that @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are gorenstein compressed of regularity @xmath31 and codimension @xmath32 one concludes that @xmath33 . to sum up",

    "since @xmath49 , this gives an upper bound for the multiplicity of @xmath42 only in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 and @xmath42 is said to be compressed if the equality holds .",
    "in other words , @xmath42 is compressed if its h - polynomial is given by @xmath52 a simple computation shows that the minimal free resolution of a compressed gorenstein @xmath28-algebra of even regularity is pure ( i.e.  only one shift in each homological position ) and hence its betti numbers just depend on @xmath50 and @xmath44",
