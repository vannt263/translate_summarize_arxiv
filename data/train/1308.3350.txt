    "solar flares are the most powerful explosion events in the solar system , able to release , in tens of minutes , up to 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3  ergs of energy .",
    "they and their ( sometimes ) associated fast coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are high energy particle accelerators , generating ions up to tens of gev and electrons to hundreds of mev (; ; ) .",
    "solar flares emit radiation across the entire em spectrum , from radio to @xmath0-ray .",
    "flare - accelerated electrons and ions interacting with the ambient solar atmosphere produce bremsstrahlung hxr/@xmath0-ray continuum @xcite and @xmath0-ray line emission @xcite , respectively .",
    "quantitative information about the parent distributions of electrons and ions can be inferred from hxr @xcite and @xmath0-ray line measurements @xcite , which introduce strong constraints on the acceleration mechanisms and interaction regions .",
    "in particular , knowledge of the hxr/@xmath0-ray photon spectrum provides fundamental information about the electron / ion beam spectra , distribution and energy contents @xcite . hxr/@xmath0-ray",
    "observations obtained with high spectral resolution are now achievable with rhessi @xcite and integral @xcite spacecraft ( see for example , ; ; ) . exploiting a general purpose satellite such as integral for solar observations is useful , because of the necessity of more observations due to the incomplete coverage of the spacecraft aimed at it .",
    "such exploitation , however , needs detector simulations in order to identify the response of the instrument in the context of solar observations , and to correct the count rates for the detector geometry relative to the sun , which varies from event to event .",
    "this is the scope of the present paper .",
    "integral spacecraft was designed to get fine spectroscopy and fine imaging of celestial ( galactic and extragalactic ) @xmath0-ray sources in the energy range of 15  kev to 10  mev , with concurrent source monitoring in the x - ray and optical energy ranges .",
    "the spi spectrometer @xcite , with its main component being the germanium ( ge ) detector matrix , observes @xmath0-rays between 20  kev and 8  mev with an energy resolution of 2.5  kev at 1.33  mev . its anti - coincidence shield ( acs ) is one of the largest detectors of astrophysical hxr and @xmath0-ray photons presently in orbit , and can be used to get lightcurves without energy information .",
    "acs consists in 91 different bgo scintillator crystals of various shapes surrounding the ge - matrix of spi .",
    "they are configured into a cylinder around spi ( an upper and lower collimator ring ) , and a side and rear shield .",
    "the collimator rings , together with the tungsten coded mask , define the field - of - view of spi .",
    "it is important to point out the fact that acs does not record energy information .",
    "it provides count rates with 50 ms time resolution above some photon energy threshold in the range of some tens of kev .",
    "this limitation may be overcome from modelling of the instrument .",
    "the effective energy value , for example , depends on the viewing angle between the spacecraft axis , the photon source ( here , the sun ) , as well as on the electronic threshold of the bgo - detectors .",
    "this information may be derived by means of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "another example is the response of the instrument to incoming photon beams with different spectral indexes , that may also be simulated .",
    "integral was designed so that ibis ( the imager instrument aboard integral ) must be always between spi and the sun , to provide shadowing to the spi cooling system .",
    "spi can never observe the sun directly ( it is typically to the rear of the instrument ) , and solar photons enter the instrument through the side or backside . despite this fact",
    ", the ge matrix of spi located inside the acs can also be reached , and @xmath0-ray spectra in the 1 - 10  mev range may be available . the lightcurves and spectra of three x - class solar flares in the late phase of solar cycle 23 have been extracted and analyzed @xcite , so far .",
    "the work presented here is carried out within the european fp7 project sepserver (; ) .",
    "the main aim of the sepserver project is to build an on - line server that will provide the space research community with solar energetic particle ( sep ) data and related observations of solar em emission , with access to scattered data from a number of international observatories . under this project",
    ", we are recollecting hxr/@xmath0-ray data recorded by integral for a set of solar flares ( related to sep events ) that occurred during the 23rd solar cycle ( 1996 - 2006 ) . by means of monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we are providing information about the acs effective area for different incoming photon energies , different spacecraft pointing configurations ( orientations of the spacecraft with respect to the sun ) and varying the electronic threshold of the bgo detectors , which is not completely known .",
    "we are also giving information about the solar observing conditions of the data under study , as well as the effective area that would characterize each solar flare .",
    "furthermore , we are comparing observational acs data with the expected number of counts obtained from the monte - carlo simulations , when using rhessi data and the simulated response of the bgo detectors .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows : in section  [ s2 ] we present the data selection considered for this study together with the observational data for the case of the june 17 , 2003 solar flare ( as a matter of example ) .",
    "section  [ s3 ] explains the monte - carlo code used for the simulations , a brief study about its performance , the initial parameters used for the simulations and the observational conditions for each solar flare .",
    "section  [ s4 ] contains the results obtained with the simulations , together with the comparison of observational acs data with those expected .",
    "section  [ s5 ] summarizes and concludes the work .",
    ".list of solar flares .",
    "[ 1 ] date ; [ 2 ] sxr peak time ; [ 3 ] sxr class ; [ 4 ] h@xmath4 location ; [ 5 ] spacecraft azimuthal angle ; [ 6 ] spacecraft meridional angle ; [ 7 ] time interval of acs detection ; [ 8 ] number of acs counts ; [ 9 ] effective area for photons with @xmath5 @xmath6 50  kev and a initial power law with spectral index @xmath7 = 3 ( see text ) .",
    "notes : ( a ) noteworthy , the hxr/@xmath0-ray detection of this flare by acs started significantly after the recorded peak time of the sxr ( goes ) .",
    "the origin of such discrepancy is not known ; ( b ) due to fluctuating background , we adopted the same time interval as for the rhessi detection ( a. shih , private communication ) ; ( c ) very high energy flux : acs saturation at 07:00:25  ut ; ( d ) the number of counts is given without acs dead - time correction due to ge - matrix annealing during this period ( prepared scientific data is not available , only raw data from the bgo cristals ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the number of counts recorded by acs includes also the contribution from the nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission .",
    "in the simulations , this contribution is estimated by taking the value of the non - corrected ( of compton - scattering by the overlying atmosphere ) 2.2-mev line fluence of and adding the 2.2-mev line to the bremsstrahlung spectrum , which we assumed to be an unbroken power law from 50  kev to 8.5  mev . then , we take a template of a nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission spectrum and we normalize it such that @xmath8(nuclear ) = 1.1 @xmath9  @xmath8(2.2  mev ) ; this value has been found for the june 12 , 2010 solar flare observed by fermi / gbm @xcite .",
    "later , we also add a 511-kev line with @xmath8(511  kev ) = 0.5  @xmath9  @xmath8(2.2  mev ) to the power - law spectrum @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum is then folded with the instrument response function and yields the values for @xmath10 presented in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the values in parenthesis are for a stronger nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission , i.e. , @xmath8(nuclear ) = 2.2  @xmath9  @xmath8(2.2  mev ) .",
    "from table  [ table3 ] we can see that the number of acs counts derived from rhessi observations and the simulated response function of the instrument overestimates in most cases the actual number of counts observed .",
    "for the two lower thresholds the disagreement is typically a factor of 2 to 3 , while the predicted counts with @xmath11  kev approach the observed ones within 30% .",
    "for the two flares with large meridional angles , where the solar photons cross the bottom part of the spacecraft , january 17 , 2005 and october 28 , 2003 , the predicted values even agree within uncertainties with the observed values . the remaining difference between the latter two flares and the three flares with smaller meridional angles ( where the photons cross ibis ) might be due to approximations of the mass model .",
    "however , a similar effect would probably also be observed if , for example , the electronic thresholds of the bgo detectors in bottom parts and upper parts of the shield are significantly different .",
    "whatever the reason , we can conclude that acs observations of solar flares agree with the expected values within 30% for a large range of observation conditions when assuming a mean electronic threshold close to 150  kev .",
    "we present the work on hxr/@xmath0-ray lightcurves registered by integral / acs for a set of 24 solar flares of the last solar cycle that is being carried out under the fp7 sepserver project .",
    "for all these flares , acs recorded a substantial increase of the count rate , with a close time relation to the peak in sxr reported by some of the goes satellites . in many cases we obtained high - quality lightcurves with 1  s resolution and , even for the weakest flares of the list with",
    "goes sxr classes extending from m1 to x18 + , all detections are mostly more than 5@xmath12 above background , as this is one of our flare detection criteria ( section  [ s2 ] ) .    as high - energy solar photons come always from outside the standard observation conditions of integral , we have performed monte - carlo simulations to determine the response of acs for each flare individually .",
    "the results of the simulations clearly show an important dependence of the effective area of acs on the angle between integral s observation axis and the position of the sun during the flare .",
    "for example , for a typical high - energy solar photon flux presenting a power - law spectrum in energy with index @xmath7=3 , the effective detection area varies by a factor of @xmath1  3 between the least and most favorable observation conditions .",
    "the mean electronic threshold @xmath13 of the 91 bgo detectors that make up acs has also an important effect on the effective area .",
    "after launch , @xmath13 was estimated to be in the 50 - 150  kev range which introduces an uncertainty of a factor of 2 on the actual effective area .",
    "this uncertainty could be largely reduced by comparing acs lightcurves for flares where the photon fluxes are known from simultaneous rhessi observations .",
    "we have shown that , for an electronic threshold value close to the upper limit of 150  kev , simulated and observed count numbers agree to within 30@xmath14 for 5 different flares representing a large range of possible observation conditions .",
    "thus , for solar hxr/@xmath0-rays above 50  kev with power - law distribution in energy with index @xmath7=3 , the effective area of acs is in the range @xmath1  100 - 300  @xmath15 .",
    "so , even if integral was not meant to perform solar observations , acs with its relatively large effective area may be able to record relatively faint solar flares ( down to m1 class flares , perhaps lower ) with a significant ( @xmath6@xmath16 above background ) detection , and record precise time profiles of the non - thermal emission . with the present results on the instrument response function , comparison with other satellites sensitive in a different energy range",
    "may now give an idea of the photon energy distribution .",
    "for stronger flares other instruments on board integral , like the ge - matrix of spi , may also provide energy spectra .",
    "we conclude that acs can very well be used for solar flare studies , being relevant for a better understanding of flare - accelerated particles .",
