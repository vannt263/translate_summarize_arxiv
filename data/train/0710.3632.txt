    "a finite impartial game is usually a game where    * there are 2 players and a starting position , * there is a finite set of possible positions of the game , * there is no hidden information , * there is no chance - device affecting how the players move , * the players move alternately and obey the same game rules , * there is at least one final position , from which a player can not move , which determines the winner of the game and * the game ends in a finite number of moves , no matter how it is played .",
    "if the winner of the game is the player who makes the final move , then we play under normal play rules , otherwise we play a misre version of the game .    in this paper _ a game _",
    ", say @xmath4 , is always a finite impartial game played under normal rules .",
    "the player who made the most recent move will be denoted by _",

    "@xmath6-position _ , or just @xmath6 .",
    "the set of all @xmath5-positions will be denoted by @xmath7 and the set of all @xmath6-positions by @xmath8 .",
    "suppose @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the two piles of a 2-pile take - away game , which contain @xmath11 and @xmath12 tokens respectively .",
    "then the _ position _ is @xmath13 and a _ move _ ( or an _ option _ ) is denoted by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 but not both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "all our games are symmetric in the sense that @xmath13 is @xmath5 if and only if @xmath19 is @xmath5 .",
    "hence , to simplify notation , when we say @xmath13 is @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) we also mean @xmath19 is @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "througout this paper , we let @xmath20 denote the non - negative integers and @xmath21 the positive integers . for integers",
    "@xmath22 we let @xmath23 $ ] denote the set @xmath24 .",
    "the classical game of nim is played on a positive number of piles , each containing a non - negative number of tokens , where the players alternately remove tokens from precisely one of the non - empty piles  that is , at least one token and at most the entire pile  until all piles are gone .",
    "the winning strategy of nim is , whenever possible , to move so that the `` nim - sum '' of the pile - heights equals zero , see for example @xcite or @xcite ( page 3 ) .",
    "when played on one single pile there are only next player winning positions except when the pile is empty . when played on two piles",
    ", the pile - heights should be equal to ensure victory for the previous player .",
    "a possible extension of a game is @xmath25 _ to adjoin the @xmath5-positions of the original game as moves in the new game_. clearly this will alter the @xmath5-positions of the original game .    indeed ,",
    "if we adjoin the @xmath5-positions of 2-pile nim as moves , then we get another famous game , namely wythoff nim ( a.k.a corner the queen ) , see @xcite .",
    "the set of moves are : remove any number of tokens from one of the piles , or remove the same number of tokens from both piles .",
    "the @xmath5-positions of this game are well - known .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the golden ratio .",
    "then @xmath27 is a @xmath5-position if and only if @xmath28 we will , in a generalised form , return to the nice arithmetic properties of this and other sequences in proposition 1 ( see also @xcite for further generalisations ) .",
    "other examples of @xmath25 are the wythoff - extensions of @xmath29-pile nim for @xmath30 discussed in @xcite as well as some extensions to the game of 2-pile wythoff nim in @xcite , where the authors adjoin subsets of the wythoff nim @xmath5-positions as moves in new games .",
    "there are other ways to construct interesting extensions to nim on just one or two piles , for example we may introduce a so called _ move - size dynamic _ restriction , where the options in some specific way depend on how the previous player moved ( for example how many tokens he removed ) , or `` pile - size dynamic''-position without any knowledge of how the game has been played up to this point . ]",
    "restrictions , where the options depend on the number of tokens in the respective piles .",
    "the game of `` fibonacci nim '' in @xcite ( page 483 ) is a beautiful example of a move - size dynamic game on just one pile .",
    "this game has been generalised , for example in @xcite .",
    "treatments of two - pile move - size dynamic games can be found in @xcite , extending the ( pile - size dynamic ) `` euclid game '' , and in @xcite .",
    "the games studied in this paper are move - size dynamic .",
    "in fact , similar to the idea in section 1.2 , there is an obvious way to alter the @xmath5-positions of a game , namely @xmath31 _ from the original game , remove the next - player winning strategy_. for 2-pile nim this means that we remove the possibility to [ imi ] _ imitate _ the previous player s move , where imitate has the following interpretation : + * definition 0 * given two piles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath32and where the number of tokens in the respective pile is counted before the previous player s removal of tokens  then , if the previous player removed tokens from pile @xmath9 , the next player _ imitates _ the previous player s move if he removes the same number of tokens from pile @xmath10 as the previous player removed from pile @xmath9 . + this game , we call _ imitation nim_. the intuition is , given the position @xmath13 , where @xmath33 , alice can prevent bob from going to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , by moving @xmath37 .",
    "we illustarate with an example : +   + * example 1 * suppose the game is imitation nim and the position is @xmath38 . if this is an a initial position , then there is no ` dynamic ' restriction on the next move so that the set @xmath39 of nim options is identical to the set of imitation nim options .",
    "but this holds also , if the previous player s move was @xmath40 or @xmath41 where @xmath42 for these cases , the imitation rule does not apply since the previous player removed tokens from the pile with more tokens .",
    "if on the other hand , the previous move was @xmath43 where @xmath44 then , by the imitation rule , precisely the option @xmath45 is prohibited .",
    "further , @xmath46 is a losing move  since , as we will see in proposition 0(i ) , @xmath47 is a winning move .",
    "but , by the imitation rule , @xmath48 is a winning move  since for this case @xmath49 is forbidden .",
    "+ this last observation leads us to ask a general question for a move - size dynamic game , roughly : _ when does the move - size dynamic rule change the outcome of a game ? _ to clarify this question , let us introduce some non - standard terminology , valid for any move - size dynamic game . +",
    "* definition 1 * let @xmath4 be a move - size dynamic game .",
    "a position @xmath50 is    1 .   _ dynamic _ : if , in the course of the game , we can not tell whether it is @xmath5 or @xmath6 without knowing the history  at least the most recent move  of the game ; 2 .",

    "ditto , but @xmath6 .",
    "* remark 1 * henceforth , if not stated otherwise , we will think of a ( move - size dynamic ) game as a game where the progress towards the current position is memorized in an appropriate manner .",
    "a consequence of this approach is that each ( dynamic ) position is @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "+ in light of these definitions , we will now characterize the winning positions of a game of imitation nim ( see also figure 1)this is a special case of our main theorem in section 2 , notice for example the absence of wythoff nim @xmath5-positions that are dynamic , considered as positions of imitation nim .",

    "* remark 2 * given the notation in proposition 0 , it is wellknown ( see also figure 1 ) that : there is an @xmath56 such that @xmath57 is a @xmath5-position of wythoff nim implies ( iia ) .",
    "one may also note that , by symmetry , there is an intersection of type ( iia ) and ( iib ) positions , namely whenever @xmath58 , that is whenever @xmath59 is an arithmetic progression .",
    "+ by proposition 0 and remark 2 @xmath60 is a dynamic position of imitation nim if and only if there is a @xmath5-position of wythoff nim , @xmath34 , with @xmath61 .",

    "recall that the first few @xmath5-positions of wythoff nim are @xmath62 hence , in example 1 , a ( non - dynamic ) @xmath5-position of imitation nim is @xmath63 .",
    "the position @xmath38 is , by the comment after remark 2 , dynamic .",
    "the positions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are non - dynamic @xmath6-positions , by proposition 0(iia ) . as examples of non - dynamic @xmath6-positions of type ( iib )",
    ", we may take @xmath66 , @xmath67 . by the comment after remark 2 ( again ) , we get : + * corollary 0 * treated as initial positions , the @xmath5-positions of imitation nim are identical to the @xmath5-positions of wythoff nim . + * remark 3 * for a given position , the rules of wythoff nim allow more options than those of nim , whereas the rules of imitation nim give fewer .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath5-positions are identical if one only considers starting positions .",
    "hence , one might want to view these variants of 2-pile nim as each others `` duals '' .",
    "our first reference for a move - size dynamic game is @xcite .",
    "but we have not been able to find any literature on the subject of _ games with memory _ , which is our next topic .",

    "then , if bob moves to @xmath74 , alice will move to @xmath75 , which is @xmath5 for a game with this particular history .",
    "this is because the move @xmath76 would have been a second consecutive imitation for bob and hence is no option .",
    "if bob chooses instead to move to @xmath77 then alice can win in the next move , since @xmath78 ( so the imitation rule does not apply ) .    indeed ,",
    "alice s first move is a winning move , so @xmath73 is @xmath6 ( which is non - dynamic ) and @xmath63 is @xmath5 .",
    "but , if @xmath63 would have been an initial position then it would have been @xmath6 , since @xmath79 would have been a winning move .",

    "there is a generalisation of wythoff nim , see @xcite , here denoted by @xmath93-wythoff nim , which ( as we will show in section 2 ) has a natural @xmath5-position correspondence with @xmath93-imitation nim .",
