    "the radiation from a charged particle moving along a helical orbit in vacuum has been widely discussed in literature ( see , for instance , bord99,hofm04 and references given therein ) .",
    "this type of electron motion is used in helical undulators for generating electromagnetic radiation in a narrow spectral interval at frequencies ranging from radio or millimeter waves to x - rays .",
    "the unique characteristics , such as high intensity and high collimation , have resulted in extensive applications of this radiation in a wide variety of experiments and in many disciplines .",
    "these applications motivate the importance of investigations for various mechanisms of controlling the radiation parameters . from this point of view , it is of interest to consider the influence of a medium on the spectral and angular distributions of the radiation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the radiation by a charged particle moving along a helical orbit inside a dielectric cylinder immersed into a homogeneous medium .",
    "specifically , formulae are derived for the electromagnetic fields and for the spectral - angular distribution of the radiation intensity in the exterior medium .",
    "it is shown that under the cherenkov condition for dielectric permittivity of the cylinder and the velocity of the particle image on the cylinder surface , strong narrow peaks are present in the angular distribution for the number of radiated quanta . at these peaks the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding quantity for a homogeneous medium by some orders of magnitude .",
    "a special case of the relativistic motion along the direction of the cylinder axis with non - relativistic transverse velocity is discussed in detail and various regimes for the undulator parameter are considered .",
    "the electromagnetic fields generated inside the cylinder by the charge moving along a helical orbit are considered in @xcite .",
    "note that the properties of the radiation from a charged particle moving along a helical orbit in homogeneous dispersive medium are studied in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we give the results of the further investigation of the radiation features for a charge moving along a helix inside a cylindrical hole in a homogeneous medium .",
    "we also compare this results with the radiation properties in the case when the particle moves with helical trajectory inside a cylindrical waveguide with conducting walls @xcite .",
    "consider a point charge @xmath5 moving along the helical trajectory of radius @xmath6 inside a cylindrical hole with radius @xmath7 in a homogeneous medium with dielectric permittivity @xmath3 ( for simplicity the magnetic permeability is taken to be unit ) .",
    "the particle velocities along the axis of the hole ( drift velocity ) and in the perpendicular plane we will denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in a properly chosen cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath10 ) the corresponding motion is described by the coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where the @xmath14-axis coincides with the hole axis and @xmath15 is the angular velocity of the charge .",
    "this type of motion can be produced by a uniform constant magnetic field directed along the axis of a cylinder , by a circularly polarized plane wave , or by a spatially periodic transverse magnetic field of constant absolute value and a direction that rotates as a function of the coordinate @xmath14 .    in @xcite",
    "it have been investigated the radiation by a charged particle moving along a helical orbit inside a dielectric cylinder immersed into a homogeneous medium .",
    "now we turn to the investigation of the features of the radiation intensity to the exterior medium at a given harmonic @xmath16 in the case when the particle moves along helical trajectory inside a cylindrical hole in dielectric medium with the dielectric permittivity @xmath17 . at large distances from the charge trajectory the dependence of elementary waves on the space - time coordinates",
    "has the form @xmath18 $ ] which describes the wave with the frequency    @xmath19    propagating at the angle @xmath20 to the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the number of the radiated quanta per period of a particle rotation for the harmonic @xmath21 is given by the formula ( see @xcite ) @xmath22 in ( [ int3 ] ) , @xmath23 is the solid angle element and    @xmath24   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{v_{\\parallel } j_{m}(\\lambda _ { 0}\\rho _ { 0})}{c\\rho _ { 1}w_{m}}\\left [ p% \\frac{\\lambda _ { 1}j_{m+p}(\\lambda _ { 0}\\rho _ { 1})h_{m}(\\lambda _ { 1}\\rho _ { 1})% } { \\alpha _ { m}w_{m+p}\\tan \\vartheta } -\\tan \\vartheta \\right ] .",
    "\\label{dmp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in these formulae @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the bessel and hankel functions , the coefficients @xmath27 are defined by the expressions @xmath28and @xmath29    in figure [ fig1 ] we have presented the dependence of the angular density of the number of the radiated quanta per period of an electron rotation , as a function of the angle @xmath20 for the harmonic @xmath30 .",
    "the values for the other parameters are as follows : electron energy @xmath31 mev , dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 . here",
    "we have introduced the angle @xmath35between the particle velocity and the axis @xmath14 : @xmath36    in the discussion below ( see equation ( [ coherent ] ) ) we will introduce also the angle @xmath37 for which the velocity of the propagation for the electromagnetic waves along the cylinder axis coincides with the projection of the particle velocity on this axis . from the graph it is seen that , though there are strong narrow peaks in left part of the graph ( on the location of these peaks see @xcite ) , the main contribution to the number of radiated quanta integrated over the angle @xmath20 , comes from the peak near @xmath38 . in the reference frame moving along the @xmath14-axis by the velocity @xmath8 , this angle corresponds to the angle @xmath39 .",
    "it is related to the angle @xmath40 by the formula @xmath41 in figure [ fig2 ] we give the angular density of the number of the radiated quanta on the harmonic @xmath30 as a function of the ratio @xmath2 for @xmath38 .",
    "the values of the other parameters are the same as those for figure [ fig1 ] .    integrating @xmath42 over the angles , we obtain the total number of the radiated quanta on a given harmonic . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we have presented the number of radiated quanta @xmath43 for @xmath30 as a function of the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "the values of the other parameters are as follows : @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 , @xmath32 .",
    "the horizontal straight line corresponds to the number of the radiated quanta in the vacuum ( @xmath47 ) . as it is seen from figure [ fig3 ]",
    "there are peaks in the number of the radiated quanta for certain values of the ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the distance between the neighboring peaks , @xmath48 , is approximately the same .",
    "the numerical calculations have shown that similar features take place for other values of the dielectric permittivity with the same locations of the peaks .",
    "the height of the peaks is a decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the height of the peak at @xmath49 is @xmath50 for @xmath51 .    from the numerical calculations it follows that the amplification of the radiation takes place at once on a set of harmonics .",
    "in figure [ fig4 ] we have plotted the dependence of the number of radiated quanta on the number of harmonic @xmath16 for the values of the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath31 mev , @xmath46 , @xmath32 . on the same graph",
    "we have also plotted the number of radiated quanta in the vacuum ( dashed curve ) .",
    "we see the following regularity : if there are peaks in the dependence of the number of radiated quanta as a function of the ratio @xmath2 for @xmath30 , then the peaks are present also for the harmonics @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "in this section we consider the radiation intensity for a charge moving in a helical orbit inside an empty circular waveguide with radius @xmath7 .",
    "we will assume that the waveguide walls are perfectly conducting .",
    "the radiation field inside the waveguide is a superposition of tm and te waves .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are equal @xmath55 , \\;b_{m , n}^{(\\sigma ) } \\equiv \\frac{cj_{m , n}^{(\\sigma ) } } { m\\omega _ { 0}\\rho _ { 1}}.   \\label{ommnsigw}\\]]in these formulae @xmath56 correspond to tm and te waves respectively , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , is the @xmath59th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath25 ( @xmath60 ) and its derivative @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we have carried out numerical calculations for the number of the quanta on a given harmonic radiated per one period of the particle orbiting:@xmath63the upper limit of the summation over @xmath59 in this formula is defined by the relation @xmath64for separate terms in ( [ int2 ] ) one has the formulae @xcite@xmath65",
    "@xmath66    if the condition@xmath67takes place then the intensity for the te waves defined by formulae ( iten ) goes to infinity .",
    "however , under these conditions the absorption in the walls of the waveguide becomes important .",
    "we can introduce the angular variable @xmath68 which is related to the frequencies by the formula@xmath69 it s possible values are determined by the formula @xmath70note that the singularity in the radiation intensity ( [ itmn ] ) noted above corresponds to the values of the angular variable determined by the condition@xmath71 in the reference frame moving along the direction of the axis @xmath14 with the velocity @xmath8 the angle corresponding to @xmath72 is equal to @xmath73 .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we have presented the number of quanta radiated on the harmonic @xmath30 as a function of the ratio @xmath4 for the values of the parameters : @xmath31 mev , @xmath46 .",
    "note that the location of the peaks in the number of radiated quanta is determined by formula ( [ peakcond ] ) with @xmath62 . comparing the numerical results presented in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ]",
    ", we see that the location of the peaks in the dependence of the radiation intensity of the ratio @xmath4 is the same for the problems considered in sections [ sec : diel ] and [ sec : waveguide ] .",
    "an explanation of this feature will be given in the next section .",
    "for simplicity let us consider the case when @xmath74 . in this case for all harmonics",
    "the hole radius is much larger than the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "we will assume that the particle is relativistic . obviously , there is a radiation direction @xmath37 for which the electromagnetic wave radiated at the point a ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) after the reflection from the wall reaches the point b at the instant of time when the particle is there . that condition is fulfilled if @xmath75for certain values of the phase this can lead to the essential change in the radiation intensity .",
    "it is clear that the radiation corresponding to the angle @xmath37 propagates in the exterior medium with the angle ( tet0 ) .",
    "as it is seen from figure [ fig1 ] , exactly near @xmath76 intense radiation appears .",
    "the radiation intensity can be essentially increased if the superposition of the waves at the point b is in the same phase .",
    "this is possible if on the optical path @xmath77 an integer number of waves should be placed:@xmath78where @xmath79 is the phase change in the reflection , @xmath80 is the wavelength in the transverse direction , and @xmath81 . from ( [ intcond ] ) and data given in figure [ fig2 ] one can conclude that the change of the phase in the reflection of the wave@xmath82by taking into account the relation ( [ coherent ] ) and formula ( lambondb ) , we have @xmath83 , and for the distance between two neighboring peaks one finds @xmath84so the peaks in figures [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] have to be equidistant , which indeed takes place with relative accuracy @xmath85 .",
    "now it is obvious from ( [ intcond ] ) , ( [ delta ] ) that if a resonance value for @xmath4 is found for some @xmath16 , then for the same values of the parameters the amplification of the radiation will be observed for the harmonics @xmath86 , @xmath87 , as well ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "as it is seen from formulae ( [ intcond])-([ropeak ] ) , for the problem discussed in section [ sec : diel ] the resonance values for the ratio @xmath2 do not depend on the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium .",
    "for this reason , for the same values of @xmath88 the increase of the radiation intensity has to be observed in the waveguide as well .",
    "this is confirmed by the graphs given in figures fig3 and [ fig5 ] .",
