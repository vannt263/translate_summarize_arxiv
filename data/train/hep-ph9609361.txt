    "the structure function , @xmath4 , for various nuclei of mass number , @xmath5 , such as @xmath6he , @xmath7li , @xmath8c , @xmath9ca , and @xmath10pb , has been precisely measured in several lepton ",
    "nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments @xcite , over a large range of the bjorken variable , @xmath1 , and momentum transfer , @xmath0 . in all cases ,",
    "the ratio of the structure function for the bound nucleon in a nucleus , @xmath5 , to that for the free nucleon , @xmath11 ( taken to be an `` average '' nucleon in deuteron ) , @xmath12 , was found to be less than unity at small and large values of @xmath1 , with antishadowing ( @xmath13 ) at intermediate @xmath1 values around @xmath14 .",
    "no significant @xmath0 dependence of these ratios has been observed so far @xcite , within the error bars of these measurements .",
    "that is , the nuclear ( bound nucleon ) and free nucleon structure functions seem to exhibit the same @xmath0 dependence .",
    "a recent measurement @xcite by the nmc presents , for the first time , a high - statistics study of the @xmath0 behaviour of the tin to carbon structure function ratio , @xmath15 ; consequently , the statistical errors are much smaller than in the earlier measurements .",
    "the data appear to show significant @xmath0 dependences , unlike what has been observed before , for other nuclei .",
    "several theoretical models of nuclear structure functions are available @xcite , that can account for such a @xmath0 dependence , especially at small values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "many of these use a hadronic approach to the problem , for example , vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , which is valid down to nearly the photoproduction limit , and regge phenomenology ; this results in effectively a higher twist ( or a @xmath16 type ) contribution , that can reproduce the observed large , positive slope of the structure function ratio at small values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "as has been pointed out @xcite , a perturbative approach to the problem , addressed , similar to the free nucleon case , via the partonic content of the bound nucleon in the leading twist ( lt ) approximation , would result in small or essentially no @xmath0 dependence of structure function ratios ; such a partonic approach should also be more applicable at larger @xmath0 .",
    "a perturbative approach , in principle , also includes a higher twist ( ht ) contribution , that dies away as @xmath16",
    ". such a contribution would therefore not be significant for @xmath0 much larger than , say , @xmath17 .",
    "there is no compulsive evidence for such ht contributions even down to @xmath18 in the free nucleon case @xcite .",
    "however , it is not known , at present , whether the @xmath0 dependence of free and bound nucleon structure functions are the same . the current sn / c data at small @xmath1 , which show a significant @xmath0 dependence , are precisely in the region of @xmath19 where it is not clearly established that ht effects are subleading .",
    "it is pertinent , therefore , to ask what is the smallest @xmath0 down to which a pure lt contribution to bound nucleon structure functions is still consistent with the new sn / c measurement .",
    "the answer , surprisingly enough , is that a pure dglap approach is still consistent with _ all _ available data , within the experimental errors .",
    "we now present the details of the calculation , and substantiate our claim .",
    "specifically , we choose , for the purposes of effecting this comparison , a model @xcite that uses standard leading order dglap @xcite ( or leading twist ) evolution equations to obtain the nuclear structure functions at various @xmath0 values , starting from a low input scale , @xmath20 .",
    "the glck - reya - vogt ( grv ) @xcite parametrisation is used for the free nucleon input , which is well - known to provide a good fit to the available proton data ; the corresponding bound nucleon input densities are obtained by calculating distortions of the free ones due to the effects of nuclear binding and swelling .",
    "binding , in particular , plays a special rle at low-@xmath1 , where shadowing is observed .",
    "details of the model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in summary ,",
    "the increased radius of the bound nucleon , due to nucleon swelling @xcite , results in a redistribution of the partons inside the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the increase in the radius , @xmath21 , of a bound nucleon , relative to a free one , is parametrised as , @xmath22 the free parameter , @xmath23 , was chosen to be 15% .",
    "( 1 ) , therefore , fixes the swelling for all @xmath5 .",
    "conservation of parton number and energy ",
    "momentum , along with use of heisenberg s uncertainty principle , then specifies the input bound nucleon parton densities , starting from the free nucleon ones , using only one free parameter that parametrises the extent of swelling , and with fixed @xmath5 dependence , as indicated in eq .",
    "nuclear binding is introduced by assigning the consequent energy loss , as computed using the weizscker mass formula , to the sea quark sector ; the sea quark density is thus depleted in comparison to the free nucleon case , by an amount dependent on its mass number , @xmath5 .",
    "such a depletion also occurs at the time of scattering , for partons with small @xmath1 , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the model predicts structure functions with very few free parameters , and with well - defined @xmath5 dependences .",
    "results have been obtained for various structure function ratios at average values of @xmath0 , corresponding to the measured values ; good agreement with data has been found in the region of validity of the model .",
    "( the model is not valid at large @xmath1 , @xmath25 , since fermi motion effects have not been included ) .      in view of the new sn / c data ,",
    "we now examine in detail the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath26sn and @xmath8c nuclear structure functions and their ratios within this dynamical model .",
    "we emphasise that , once the model has been fitted to data from nuclei such as helium or carbon , as has already been done , the resulting tin structure function is essentially fixed , with no more free parameters . furthermore , the magnitude and the @xmath0 dependence in the base case , viz .",
    ", for the structure function of proton or deuteron ( which is considered to be the prototype `` average nucleon '' ) is well reproduced by this model .",
    "( it is in fact tailored to do so ) .",
    "since the bound nucleon densities are computed in a manner similar to that of the free nucleon ones , that is , by the dglap evolution equations , the @xmath0 dependence of the bound densities is similar to that of the free ones .",
    "the only difference lies in the input ( starting ) densities , which are computed according to standard nuclear inputs .",
    "hence our model exhibits only a weak @xmath0 dependence for all structure function ratios @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the model prediction for the structure function ratio , @xmath27 , is plotted for various @xmath1 values in the range between about 0.01 and 0.4 ( the central value of the corresponding experimental @xmath1 bin was used ) as a function of @xmath0 , for @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "note that all the data lie in the accepted perturbative regime of @xmath30 .",
    "20truecm    although the central values of the data at low-@xmath1 are strongly increasing with @xmath0 , it is seen that the model is in good agreement with the available data , within the errors of the experiment .",
    "the @xmath31 per degree of freedom of the fits , as shown in table  [ table1 ] , is seen to be around unity or less .",
    "the only exception is the last @xmath1-bin , @xmath32 ; however , here our model is not expected to hold , since we have not included fermi motion effects .",
    "( this also seems to indicate that these effects are severely @xmath5-dependent and so do not cancel in the ratio of structure functions ) .",
    "the average @xmath33d.o.f .",
    "@xmath34 for the complete data set , indicating that the model is consistent with the data .",
    "this further improves to 109/136 if we drop the last data point , @xmath32 .",
    ".the @xmath31 fits of the model with the nmc data on the @xmath0 dependence of the tin to carbon structure function ratio @xcite , for various @xmath1 bins , the central values of which are shown . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     8truecm    such a @xmath0 dependence @xcite implies that the corresponding spin asymmetry , @xmath35 which is what is usually measured in dis with polarised targets , will show more sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where both the free ( @xmath36 ) and bound ( @xmath37 ) nucleon asymmetries are shown ( using @xmath38 ) for various @xmath1 values accessible by current experiments .",
    "the _ extent _ of the @xmath0 dependence , as has been exhibited by a comparison with the available data in table  [ table3 ] , gives hope that , when more data is available , this large @xmath0 dependence can actually be observed . for instance , the asymmetry changes by about 1520% for @xmath1 from 0.0250.2 , in going from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "as has already been pointed out @xcite , the nuclear dependence effectively cancels in the ratio , eq .",
    "( 5 ) , so that the free and bound nucleon asymmetries are nearly equal ; hence the e142 measurement ( which measures the bound nucleon neutron asymmetry in helium ) still provides a good measure of the free neutron asymmetry , and hence no information at all about nuclear effects .",
    "it seems as if information on spin dependent _ nuclear _ structure functions can only be obtained by measuring ratios similar to that shown in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , or plotted in fig .  [ fig3 ] : @xmath41 rather than from measurement of the conventional polarisation asymmetry , @xmath42 .    8truecm",
    "we conclude that a perturbative approach to nuclear structure functions with the use of the leading twist dglap evolution equations predicts , not just the ratios , but also the magnitudes of various nuclear structure functions , and their @xmath0 behaviour as well , that are consistent with all data so far available .",
    "such an approach typically yields a very flat @xmath0 behaviour for structure function ratios at small @xmath1 .",
    "a similar @xmath0 behaviour of bound and free nucleon spin independent structure functions is therefore indicated .",
    "another perturbative approach , using parton recombination and @xmath0 rescaling arguments , has been able to obtain a non - trivial @xmath0 dependence @xcite , similar in nature to that obtained by non - partonic approaches @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence in this model , though , is very sensitive to the input parameters @xcite .",
    "however , a persistence of the significant @xmath0 dependence in the sn / c ratio at small @xmath1 ( for @xmath43 ) , accompanied by a shrinking of the corresponding error bars by the acquisition of more data , could well signify the presence of higher twist effects , which have not so far been observed for the free nucleon case at such @xmath0 values .",
    "this would significantly affect the extraction of spin dependent structure functions from polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments off polarised nuclear targets as well .",
    "hence , a detailed experimental study of the @xmath0 dependence of the spin polarisation asymmetry is also urged . in short ,",
    "it would be interesting to obtain more data for various nuclei in the small-@xmath1 region , both in polarised and unpolarised experiments , in order to verify if a universal @xmath0 behaviour of free and bound nucleon structure functions exists .",
    "this is bound to throw more light on the nature and origin of the modifications of parton densities in nuclei .",
