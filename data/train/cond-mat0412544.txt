    "resonances that undergo a complete evolution from breit - wigner resonances to a window resonance are all associated with the _ second _ even excited state in the cavity , while resonances that display a strictly monotonic increase of the width with increasing cavity opening are connected to transport through the transverse _ ground state _ of the cavity .",
