    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are a ubiquitous constituent of spheroids in nearby galaxies ( e.g. kormandy & richstone  1995 ) . a decade ago it became apparent that the masses of smbhs correlate with the luminosity of the host spheroid ( kormandy & richstone  1995 ) .",

    "these relations must hold important clues about the astrophysics that regulates the growth of a smbh and its impact on galaxy formation . while much attention was dedicated towards interpreting the power - law slope of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation via a slew of analytic , semi - analytic and numerical attempts to reproduce it ( e.g. silk & rees  1998 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ; king  2003 ; miralda - escude & kollmeier  2005 ; adams et al .",

    "we constrain the astrophysics of smbh growth by computing minimum values for the scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation using various models for the regulation of smbh growth .",

    "we assume that the gas available to cool in the halo makes most of the mass within the effective radius of the spheroid @xmath2 with a density distribution described by a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile .",
    "the cooling of baryons modifies the density profile of a galaxy and hence its rotation curve .",
    "in particular , the velocity dispersion in the luminous portion of the galaxy is substantially larger than would be expected from an nfw profile .",

    "however the cooled profile , and hence the value of @xmath1 obtained from the cooled profile depends on the value adopted for @xmath48 .",
    "defining @xmath49 to be the fraction of the total galaxy mass that makes the spheroid ( including the cooled baryons ) , we can break this degeneracy by identifying the spheroid mass @xmath50 with the effective virial mass @xmath2 through @xmath51 . with this second relation",

    "the upper value corresponds to the case where all baryons in the halo cool to form the mass of the spheroid [ so that @xmath53 , and the range under consideration spans values smaller by up to an order of magnitude relative to this extreme case . using this formalism we generate a sample of model spheroids .",
    "this sample is compared first to the observed fundamental plane of early - type galaxies ( below ) , and then used to discuss the scatter in models for the @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath2 relations (   [ models ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a scatter plot of @xmath48 vs @xmath1 for cooled profiles with randomly selected parameters .",
    "the distribution of formation redshift is dictated by the merger trees of halos and corresponding fate of pre - existing galaxies within these halos ( eisenstein & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "it is known empirically that star formation is rather minimal between @xmath54 for elliptical galaxies ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) . since we find that the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath24 is not very sensitive to the precise probability distribution of collapse redshifts , we adopt in this figure a distribution of collapse redshifts that is flat between @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting points show a correlation with significant scatter . for comparison , the relation between the velocity dispersion @xmath1 of an early type stellar system and its effective radius @xmath56 for galaxies from the sdss ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) is shown by the grey dots .",
    "a fit to this observed correlation has the form @xmath57 which is plotted as the thick solid line in figure  [ fig2 ] .",

    "on comparison with the results of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we see that the formalism reproduces the observed behavior @xmath59 .",
    "moreover the size of the predicted scatter about the mean relation is @xmath60dex , in good agreement with the observed value of @xmath61dex .",
    "this result is not very sensitive to the ( unknown ) distribution chosen for @xmath62 .",
    "the model does not contain any free parameters .",

    "for completeness we note that the relation described by equation  ( [ resigma ] ) depends only on dynamical properties and not on the details of star - formation .",
    "however elliptical galaxies follow a 3-parameter _ fundamental plane _",
    ", with the scatter around the median @xmath12@xmath1 relation parameterized by surface brightness rather than a 2 parameter relation ( djorgovski & davis  1987 ) .",
    "the scatter around the _ fundamental plane _ is substantially smaller than around the @xmath12@xmath1 relation shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "bernardi et al  ( 2003 ) find that the fundamental plane has the form @xmath63 where the surface brightness is @xmath64 , and show that this requires the mass - to - light @xmath65 to have a dependence on @xmath12 of the form @xmath66 .",
    "a complete model of the _ fundamental plane _ would need to explain this dependence of the mass - to - light ratio , in addition to the relation @xmath67 .",
    "however we do not expect smbh growth to depend on @xmath65 , and do not attempt to model this ( orthogonal ) parameter .    finally , we note that the non - linearity of the relation between @xmath67 is surprising since it is derived within the context of cdm dark - matter halos for which the relation between the virial radius and velocity is @xmath68 at any given redshift . in the following section we discuss the growth of smbhs inside host spheroids in light of the observed scatters in the @xmath13@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath2 relations .",

    "( 1998 ) relation that the mass of the smbh follows the mass of the spheroid has motivated models where the mass of the smbh accretes a constant fraction of the available gas following a major merger ( e.g. haiman & loeb 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) .",
    "we refer to this scenario as case - i .",
    "second , the observation of the @xmath13@xmath1 relation implies that the smbh growth is regulated by the depth of the gravitational potential well of its host spheroid .",
    "we refer to this scenario as case - ii .",
    "third , there is evidence from the observation of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation in quasars , that the @xmath0@xmath1 relation does not vary with redshift ( shields et al .",
    "this motivates a revision of case - ii , to include regulation of the smbh growth over the dynamical time of the system ( e.g. silk & rees  1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "we refer to this as case - iii . on the other hand",
    "if momentum rather than energy is conserved in the transfer of energy in a quasars outflow to the cold galactic gas , then rather than a smbh regulated by binding energy , we have a smbh mass regulated by the binding energy divided by the virial velocity ( silk & rees 1998 ; king  2003 ; begelman 2004 ; murray , quataert , & thompson 2005 ) . in analogy with cases -",
    "ii and iii , the smbh mass may be regulated by the total momentum of the surrounding gas , or by the total momentum divided by the systems dynamical time .",
    "we refer to these as cases - iv and v , respectively .",
    "we therefore test five hypotheses for each of the @xmath13@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath2 relations . in the previous section we described a model that reproduces the observed behavior of @xmath59 , with a scatter of @xmath61dex .",
    "the agreement with the observed projection of the fundamental plane ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) , gives us confidence that the model provides a sufficiently accurate framework within which we can discuss the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath2 relations .",

    "case - iii : the mass of the smbh is determined by the mass for which accretion at the eddington limit provides a constant fraction of the binding energy of the baryons in the spheroid over a constant fraction of the spheroid s dynamical time . thus , the black - hole mass scales as @xmath71 . * case - iv : as in case - ii , but with the momentum rather than the energy of the outflow coupling to the gas in the spheroid , yielding @xmath72 . * case - v : as in case - iii , but with the momentum rather than the energy of the outflow coupling to the gas in the spheroid over a dynamical time , yielding @xmath73",
    ".    studies of the local smbh inventory suggest that most of mass in smbhs was accreted during a luminous quasar phase ( e.g. yu & tremaine  2002 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004 ) , with a potentially significant contribution from an additional dust  obscured accretion phase ( martinez - sansigre et al .",
    "if the fraction of obscured quasars is independent of redshift , then the quasar luminosity function ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ; boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) can be used as a proxy for the distribution of smbh formation redshifts . using this redshift distribution and the formalism outlined in the previous sub - section",

    "cases - i , ii and iv do not produce perfect @xmath13@xmath1 relations even under this unique coupling assumption due to the scatter in the @xmath12@xmath1 relation . similarly , the scatter in the @xmath12@xmath1 relation leads to scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation for cases - iii and v. as a result , cases - iii and v predict a scatter in the @xmath13@xmath2 relation that is larger than in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation , in agreement with observations .",
    "obviously in these five cases we have neglected many additional sources of scatter .",
    "these include , but are not limited to , the fraction of the eddington limit at which the smbh shines during its luminous phase , the efficiency of coupling of feedback energy or momentum to the gas in the host spheroid , and the fraction of the system s characteristic size for which the dynamical time should be computed . in all five cases the minimum values of the scatter are smaller than the observed @xmath76 .",
    "however in cases i , ii and iv , the models predict a scatter in the @xmath13@xmath2 relation that is smaller than in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation while the observations show the opposite . on the other hand",
    "if smbhs are regulated by the binding energy or momentum of gas in the spheroid per dynamical time of the spheroid ( cases  iii & v ) , then the minimum scatter in the @xmath7@xmath1 relation is reduced to zero .",
    "cases - iii and v therefore predict that the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation should be larger than in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation as observed .",
    "the scatter in the projection of the fundamental plane onto the @xmath12@xmath1 plane therefore allows us to differentiate between smbh growth that is regulated by the mass ( case - i ) , binding energy ( case - ii ) or momentum of gas ( case - iv ) in the spheroid , and smbh growth that is regulated by energy or momentum feedback over a dynamical time of the spheroid ( cases - iii and v ) . in the latter cases the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation is increased by the large scatter in the spheroid radius , @xmath48 . on the other hand in cases - iii and v , @xmath12 cancels out in the division of mass by dynamical time in the determination of @xmath0 at constant @xmath1 .",
    "if the predicted value for the minimum scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation is smaller than the observed value of @xmath76 dex , then there is room in the model for additional random scatter to account for varying eddington ratio , outflow geometry , dust composition , and other factors . in each case",

    "we therefore conclude that smbh growth is likely regulated by feedback over the spheroid s dynamical time .",

    "at redshift @xmath37 , the smbhs obey @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the slope and @xmath99 is a constant .",
    "the final smbh and spheroid masses at @xmath100 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "using the above scaling the final velocity dispersion is @xmath103 .",
    "we therefore find @xmath104 .",
    "thus the normalization of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation at fixed @xmath1 is changed by a factor @xmath105 through collisionless mergers .",
    "note that the slope of the @xmath13@xmath1 relation @xmath98 is preserved if @xmath94 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "however the number of progenitors is a function of halo mass and redshift , and so the change in normalization could be a function of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to changing the normalization of the @xmath0@xmath24 relation , collisionless mergers will also introduce scatter . in the limit of a perfect correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath24 , and where the number of progenitors ( @xmath106 ) is constant",
    ", the argument in the previous paragraph shows that collisionless mergers would lead to an @xmath0@xmath1 relation with no additional scatter beyond that introduced at the formation redshift .",
    "however the scatter in the @xmath12@xmath1 correlation combined with the relation @xmath107 implies that there is @xmath61dex of scatter in @xmath2 at fixed @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , different galaxies have different merger histories and therefore a different number of progenitors . scatter among the properties of the initial building blocks at redshift @xmath37 therefore leads to scatter in the local @xmath0@xmath1 relation even if the @xmath13@xmath1 relation at @xmath37 were perfect .",
    "this scatter introduced through collisionless mergers will therefore add scatter to the local @xmath0@xmath1 relation beyond that intrinsic to the formation process itself .    to ascertain the quantitative effect of collisionless mergers on scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , we generate merger trees of dark - matter halos using the method described in vollonteri ,",
    "haardt & madau  ( 2003 ) . based on the merger trees we find the @xmath106 progenitor halos at @xmath108 that lead to a halo of known mass at @xmath109 . using the formalism outlined in   [ fpsec ]",
    "we then determine the values of @xmath1 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 for the spheroids populating these progenitor halos .",
    "we also populate the spheroids with smbhs of mass @xmath0 according to the perfect @xmath13@xmath1 relations that arise from cases - iii and v. the final smbh mass residing in the halo at @xmath100 is @xmath110 .",
    "it is embedded in a spheroid of mass @xmath111 .",
    "based on the above scaling for the inner @xmath91 density profile of an nfw halo we may estimate the value of velocity dispersion corresponding to the final spheroid , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the mass and velocity dispersion of the largest progenitor . in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the scatter introduced into a perfect @xmath0@xmath1 relation originating at @xmath115 ( left ) , @xmath116 ( center ) and @xmath117 ( right ) by collisionless mergers between those redshifts and @xmath100 .",
    "as discussed above this scatter arises as a result of scatter in the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the progenitors .",
    "the upper panels show results for case - iii ( @xmath118 ) , while the lower panels show results for case - v ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the scatter introduced is roughly independent of @xmath1 and takes values of @xmath120dex , @xmath121dex and @xmath122dex for mergers originating at @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "thus galaxies that become devoid of gas at higher redshift lead to a larger scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation , because these galaxies undergo more collisionless mergers by @xmath100 than a galaxy which becomes devoid of gas only at late times .",
    "the stars that populate massive galaxies appear to be older than those in low mass galaxies ( kauffmann et al .",
    "the cold gas reservoir that made these stars must have been depleted at a higher redshift for the progenitors of high-@xmath1 galaxies .",
    "we might therefore expect more scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation at large @xmath1 .",
    "for equal mass mergers we have shown that the normalization of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation at a fixed @xmath1 changes by a factor @xmath105 .",
    "thus , for @xmath123 ( case - iii ) , we find that the amplitude of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation should be reduced by collisionless mergers , while for @xmath124 ( case - v ) the amplitude should be preserved . this behavior is seen in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "moreover , more massive galaxies undergo a larger rate of major mergers .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows that in case - v the change in normalization of the @xmath13@xmath1 relation through collisionless mergers is more significant in high mass than in low mass galaxies , as expected .",
    "collisionless mergers could therefore lead to a reduction in the steepness of the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation if @xmath125 .    in summary , in order to satisfy the constraint that the @xmath13@xmath1 relation have a scatter at @xmath100 that is smaller than @xmath126dex",
    ", the intrinsic scatter in the relation at the formation redshift should be smaller than @xmath61 dex , so as to allow for the additional scatter introduced through collisionless mergers .",
    "cases - iii and v meet this requirement .",
    "recent evidence suggests that the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is preserved out to high redshift ( shields et al .",
    "2003 ) , while smbhs make a larger fraction of their host spheroid mass at higher redshift ( rix et al .  2001 ; croom et al .  2004 ; walter et al .",
    "this behavior is reproduced in models with scenarios of the form case - iii or case - v .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows a scatter plot of the predicted residuals in @xmath0 vs @xmath37 at constant @xmath127 ( upper row ) and @xmath128 ( lower row ) for each of the five models .",
    "the residuals are normalized relative to the mean relation at @xmath129 in each case . while there is no evolution in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for cases - iii and v",
    ", we see that smbhs are predicted to be an order of magnitude more massive with respect to their host spheroid at @xmath130 than they are at @xmath131 in agreement with observations .",
    "in contrast , models for case - i , ii and iv predict that the smbh mass should decrease by an order of magnitude between @xmath100 and @xmath132 at constant @xmath1 , while not evolving significantly at constant @xmath2 .",
    "the observed evolution of smbh mass with redshift therefore supports cases iii and v as the scenario for smbh growth .",
    "this result supports the findings of   [ models ] based on the scatter in local relations .",
    "attempts to reproduce the observed luminosity function of quasars associate the mass of the smbh with the properties of the host dark - matter halo .",
    "this paradigm allows the abundance of smbhs to be traced either in semi - analytic or numerical models ( e.g. haiman & loeb  1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ; vollonteri , haardt & madau  2002 ) .",
    "indeed , ferrarese  ( 2001 ) has inferred a relation between the masses of smbhs and their host dark - matter halo .",
    "_ is it possible that the halo rather than the spheroid regulates smbh growth ? _    since we have computed spheroid properties within a specified dark matter halo , we are in a position to discuss the role of the dark matter halo in regulating the smbh growth .",
    "in addition to the five cases listed above for smbh growth within a spheroid , we also try five analogous cases for the formation of smbhs governed by dark matter halo properties . for each of the additional five cases ,",
    "we compute the distribution of residuals ( in dex ) relative to the mean relation as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 via a monte - carlo algorithm for smbh formation , and calculate the variance at each of constant @xmath133 and constant @xmath128 . below we list the details of each case .",
    "the resulting distributions of residuals are plotted in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the values of scatter are listed in the 6th and 7th columns of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the ratio of the scatter at constant @xmath7 and at constant @xmath1 are listed in column  8 .",
    "values for the slopes @xmath74 and @xmath75 are listed in columns 9 and 10 .    * case - i : the mass of the smbh forms from a constant fraction of the baryonic component of the halo mass , @xmath134 .",
    "* case - ii : the mass of the black - hole grows in proportion to the binding energy of baryons in the halo . for an nfw profile with a concentration parameter",
    "@xmath44 we get @xmath135 , where @xmath136 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] * case - iii : the mass of the smbh is determined by the mass for which accretion at the eddington limit provides the binding energy of baryons in the halo over a constant fraction of the halo s dynamical time ( wyithe & loeb  2003 ) .",
    "we therefore have @xmath137 . * case - iv : same as case - ii , but with the momentum rather than the energy of the outflow coupling to the gas in the spheroid .",
    "we then find @xmath138 * case - v : same as case - iv , but with the momentum rather than the energy of the outflow coupling to the gas in the spheroid over a dynamical time .",
    "we then find @xmath139 .    in these five cases",
    "we have again neglected many possible causes of scatter . however in case - i , where the smbh growth is regulated by halo properties , the minimum value of the scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation is slightly smaller than the observed @xmath76 .",
    "we have added random scatter to the model for case - i in order to bring the predicted scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 up to the observed value .",
    "this value and the corresponding prediction for @xmath23 and @xmath140 are listed in parentheses .",
    "case - i predicts a scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation that is similar to the @xmath0@xmath1 relation while the observations suggest the latter to be significantly smaller . while case - i can not be ruled out based only on the predicted minimum scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation at the formation redshift , the small allowance for additional expected scatter from the aforementioned astrophysical sources renders it unlikely , particularly when the additional scatter of @xmath141dex from collisionless mergers at low redshift is accounted for . in cases",
    "ii , iii , iv and v where the smbh growth is regulated by halo properties , the minimum values of the scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation are larger than the observed @xmath76 .    while scatter within models of spheroid regulated smbh growth is not sensitive to the distribution of @xmath49 , the predicted scatter in models of halo regulated smbh growth decreases as the assumed range of @xmath49 decreases . however , in order to reduce the predicted scatter below the @xmath61dex threshold at the formation redshift ( which would allow for additional scatter to be introduced through collisionless mergers ) , we find that the allowed range around @xmath142 would need to be smaller than @xmath143 , which is implausibly narrow . we therefore conclude that it is the spheroid rather than the dark - matter halo which drives the evolution of smbh mass .      we have demonstrated that the tight relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 implies that it is the spheroid rather than the halo which governs the growth of smbhs .",
    "however it is clear that since there is an @xmath0@xmath1 relation , and since larger halos will , on average , host bulges with larger central velocity dispersions , there should also be a correlation between smbh and halo mass .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2001 ) has found such a relation . since it is not possible to measure the dark matter halo mass directly , halo masses for galaxies in the local sample",
    "were inferred via a maximum circular velocity estimated from @xmath24 based on an empirical relation .",
    "it is therefore difficult to estimate the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath36 relation observationally .",
    "here we predict the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath144 relation at a fixed value of @xmath36 . we compute the distribution of residuals via a monte - carlo method as before .",
    "we choose @xmath145 and find the distribution of values for @xmath1 , and hence the distribution of @xmath0 using the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "the resulting distribution is plotted in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the variance is @xmath146 dex .",
    "thus the tightness of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation suggests that the @xmath0@xmath36 correlation is incidental to the fundamental relation between the smbh and its host spheroid .",
    "note that this variance is computed at the time of the smbh formation .",
    "the surrounding dark matter halo could continue to grow after the supply of cold gas to the smbh had ceased .",
    "this is consistent with our conclusion that smbhs grow in proportion to the properties of the spheroid rather than the halo .",
    "indeed one finds massive dark - matter halos in x - ray clusters , which must have increased their velocity dispersion well beyond the corresponding smbh growth ( due to the lack of cooling flows in cluster cores ) .",
    "this late - time growth of dark - matter halos increases considerably the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath36 relation .",
    "we have investigated the implications of intrinsic scatter in the local relations involving smbhs for models of smbh formation . using the sample of spheroid properties from sdss ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) we first examined empirically the fundamental parameter describing smbh growth .",
    "the observed scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is @xmath30 , while the @xmath0@xmath2 relation has a larger observed scatter of @xmath18 . assuming that the @xmath0@xmath2 relation is fundamental , we use the sdss spheroid sample to compute the resulting scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation .",
    "we find that this procedure results in a scatter of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation that is too large to be reconciled with observation .",
    "alternatively , one might assume that smbh growth is determined by @xmath1 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "in this case we used the smbh sample to compute the resulting scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation , and found agreement with the observed scatter .",
    "we therefore conclude that smbh growth is governed by @xmath1 , and that the observed correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is a by - product of the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "theoretical models for smbh formation must reproduce several observational constraints : _",
    "( i ) _ the scatter in the local @xmath0@xmath24 relation is @xmath30 dex , implying that at the time of formation the scatter should be smaller than @xmath61dex to allow for additional scatter introduced by collisionless mergers of galaxies since @xmath131 or earlier ; _ ( ii ) _ the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath7 relation is larger than in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation ( this result is maintained as additional scatter from collisionless mergers is introduced after smbh formation ) ; and _ ( iii ) _ the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is preserved out to high redshift .",
    "we find that these constraints are only met by models where smbh growth is regulated by feedback on the gas feeding the smbh over the spheroid dynamical time .",
    "other models lead to scatter in the @xmath13@xmath1 relation that are too large or scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation that is smaller than the @xmath13@xmath1 relation .",
    "in addition , other models lead to a smbh mass that drops with increasing redshift at a fixed velocity dispersion .",
    "the feedback in successful models can be either in the form of energy or momentum transfer between the quasar and the galactic gas , leading to power - law slopes in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation of @xmath119 or @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "both of these slopes are permitted by the local sample ( wyithe  2005 ) .",
    "the above constraints do _ not _ permit smbh growth to be governed by the properties of the dark - matter halos .",
    "such models lead to scatter in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation that are too large and/or scatter in the @xmath0@xmath2 relation that is smaller than the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "the relation between @xmath13 and the halo mass ( ferrarese  2001 ) has a large scatter ( @xmath147dex ) and is most likely a by - product of the correlation between halo mass and @xmath1 ."
