    "in spintronics the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron ( spin ) is used to develop new or improved electronic components . in the spin - transfer torque ( stt )",
    "mechanism proposed by slonczewski and berger in 1996 @xcite , a spin polarized charge current entering a magnetic layer exerts a torque on the magnetization by transfer of angular momentum .",
    "nowadays stt is being extensively studied and stt switchable random access memory ( stt - ram ) is one of the prime candidates for replacing dynamic ram ( dram ) in the future @xcite .",
    "the two spin channel model @xcite describes collinear transport , in for instance giant magnetoresistance devices , but is not able to explain and quantify the absorption of transverse spins in stt .",
    "therefore a so called spin mixing conductance ( @xmath1 ) was defined @xcite that gives the efficiency with which these spins transverse to the magnetization direction are absorbed at the non - magnetic ( n)@xmath2ferromagnetic ( f ) interface .",
    "@xmath1 can be determined experimentally by performing angular magnetoresistance measurements.@xcite    in recent years research in the field of spin caloritronics , the interplay between spin and heat transport , has led to exciting new results.@xcite in the spin - dependent seebeck effect ( sdse ) @xcite heat flow is used to inject a spin polarized current from f into n , which can exert an stt on the magnetization of a second f layer .",
    "indications of such a tstt have been reported by yu et al .",
    "@xcite , where they observed a change in the switching field of a co@xmath2cu@xmath2co spin valve in the second harmonic response to a current sent through the nanowire .",
    "nevertheless a complete study where the efficiency of the tstt is quantified and a comparison with stt is made , is still lacking .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide such a study of tstt in f@xmath2n@xmath2f gmr nanopillars . using the same device to study the gmr , the sdse as well as their angle dependence we are able to reliably compare both .",
    "furthermore we discuss measurements oriented at directly observing tstt and the obstacles that come with it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : amr_asse ] , we discuss the theory of stt and tstt and specifically describe how the angle dependent gmr and sdse in magneto electron circuit theory provides a way to quantify both mechanisms . furthermore we show that a spin heat accumulation affects the asdse measurements , as the energy dependence of the spin mixing conductance becomes relevant .",
    "section [ sec : exp ] describes the device fabrication as well as the measurement techniques that were used .",
    "section [ sec : exp_results ] presents the gmr and sdse measurement results and compares their angle dependences .",
    "the difference between the two leads us to conclude that a spin heat accumulation builds up in our devices .",
    "section [ sec : tt ] presents measurements where the effect of tstt on the magnetic switching field is studied . in section [ sec : disc ]",
    "we discuss the results presented and conclude that only @xmath010% of the response is due to tstt .",
    "if , in an f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack , the magnetization of one of the f layers is rotated while keeping the other pinned , noncollinear spin transport becomes important .",
    "the spin current flowing from one f layer to the other will have a spin component transverse to the magnetization direction of the second f layer .",
    "contrary to the collinear case these transverse spin components are not eigenstates of the ferromagnet and its angular momentum will be absorbed by destructive interference in f over the decoherence length , expected to be @xmath31 nm for transition metals.@xcite the absorbed angular momentum gives a torque on the magnetization which , if large enough , can excite magnetization dynamics or even reverse its direction .",
    "in magnetoelectronic circuit theory @xcite the real part of the spin mixing conductance ( @xmath4 ) , in typical metals an order of magnitude larger than the imaginary part , gives the efficiency with which the electron s spin component transverse to the magnetization ( m ) direction are absorbed at an f@xmath2n interface:@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the transverse angular momentum current absorbed and @xmath7 is the the spin accumulation ( @xmath8 ) at the f@xmath2n interface with the electron spin pointing perpendicular to m. the charge current through an f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack @xcite depends on the angle between the two magnetizations ( @xmath9 ) in the thermalized regime as follows:@xcite    @xmath10 \\label{eq : current}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the voltage and temperature difference across the spin active part of f @xcite , @xmath13 is the f s seebeck coefficient or thermopower , @xmath14=@xmath15 is the spin polarization of the f s conductance , @xmath16=@xmath17 with the spin polarization of the seebeck coefficient @xmath18=@xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 can be determined for a certain f@xmath2n interface by using @xmath22 as a fitting parameter for angle dependent magnetoresistance ( amr ) measurements , by setting @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eq : current ] ( see appendix [ app_derivation]):@xcite @xmath24    a similar approach can be used for the angle dependence of the sdse ( asdse ) , which is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : current ] for @xmath25 ( see appendix [",
    "app_derivation]):@xcite @xmath26    both the mr and the sdse produce a spin current running from one of the f layers to the other and therefore lead to a spin transfer torque , either current driven ( stt ) or driven by a temperature difference ( tstt ) .",

    "the description given above holds in the thermalized regime where strong inelastic scattering between the two spin channels leads to energy exchange and ensures that they remain at the same temperature .",
    "however if inelastic scattering is relatively weak the electron temperatures can become spin - dependent and a spin heat accumulation will build up @xcite .",
    "such a spin heat accumulation produces an additional sdse term which depends on the spin heat accumulation itself and the energy derivative of @xmath4 , and a normalized spin mixing thermopower can be defined @xmath29 @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the asdse curve shape will differ from that in the thermalized regime and eq .",
    "[ eq : asdse ] will not accurately describe the observed asdse behaviour .",
    "the samples are prepared on top of a thermally oxidized si substrate by 8 or 9 consecutive electron - beam lithography ( ebl ) steps , depending on the stack type .",
    "all the materials are deposited by e - beam evaporation with a base pressure of @xmath30 mbar .    in this paper",
    "two types of f@xmath2n@xmath2f stacks are used .",
    "one for the angle dependent measurements ( section [ sec : exp_results ] ) and an other for the tstt measurements ( section [ sec : tt ] ) , for convenience they are named stack type a ( fig . [",
    "fig : sample](b ) ) and b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sample](c ) ) respectively . for both stack types",
    "the full device consists of a bottom platinum ( pt ) contact of 60 nm thick and a 130 nm thick gold ( au ) top contact with the f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack sandwiched in between ( see figure [ fig : sample](a ) ) . on both sides of the pt bottom",
    "contact pt joule heaters of 40 nm thick are placed to produce a thermal gradient across the f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack .",
    "an 8 nm thick aluminium oxide ( al@xmath31o@xmath32 ) layer seperates these pt heaters from side extensions of the pt bottom contact , ensuring strong thermal contact between the two but excluding any direct electrical pick up . around the stack a @xmath0150 nm thick layer of polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) e - beam resist is crosslinked , electrically isolating the top from the bottom contact .",
    "the stack of type a , see figure [ fig : sample](b ) , is fabricated in two steps .",
    "first a circular f@xmath33 layer of 15 nm thick permalloy ( py)(ni@xmath34fe@xmath35 ) is deposited , with a diameter of 300 nm .",
    "after cleaning the interface by ar ion milling , to create a good ohmic contact , the remainder of the stack is deposited consisting of a 10 nm thick copper layer ( cu ) followed by a 10 nm thick py layer with lateral dimensions of @xmath36 nm@xmath37 .",
    "because f@xmath33 is circular there is no preferential in - plane direction for the magnetization .",
    "the magnetization of f@xmath33 ( m@xmath33 ) will therefore easily follow a relatively small rotating applied magnetic field .",
    "however , the rectangular shape of f@xmath38 ensures an easy axis for m@xmath38 , parallel to its longest side , due to shape anisotropy .",
    "therefore the rotation of m@xmath38 is negligible when the applied field is much lower than the field needed to rotate m@xmath38 or to overcome its hard axis direction .",
    "such magnetic behavior is ideal for magnetization angle dependent measurements , further discussed in section [ sec : exp_results ] .",
    "stacks of type b , see figure [ fig : sample](c ) , are rectangular in shape ( @xmath39 nm@xmath37 ) and consists of 15 nm ( f@xmath33 ) and 5 nm ( f@xmath38 ) thick py layers separated by a 15 nm thick cu spacer .",
    "the full stack is deposited without breaking vacuum .",
    "both magnetic layers have the same easy axis direction giving two distinct stable states , namely parallel or anti parallel alignment of the two magnetizations .",
    "these stacks are used in section [ sec : tt ] to investigate changes in switching field due to tstt .",
    "the electrical measurements presented in this paper are all performed using standard lock - in detection techniques , providing a way to distinguish first harmonic response signals ( @xmath40 ) from second harmonic response signals ( @xmath41 ) . to ensure a thermal steady - state condition a low excitation frequency of 17  hz was used .",
    "all measurements are performed at room temperature except for the temperature dependent measurement in section [ sec : tt ] , where a peltier heating element together with a thermometer is used to bring and keep the sample at a preset elevated temperature .",
    "to investigate the amr and asdse an f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack of type a is used ( see section [ sec : exp ] ) . for characterization purposes we first measure the mr and sdse .",
    "[ fig : angle_meas](b ) gives the mr measurement where the resistance across the stack is measured as a function of the applied magnetic field ( b ) , parallel to the easy axis of f@xmath38 .",
    "just after b passes through zero the magnetization in the f@xmath33 layer switches as it has no easy axis direction .",
    "the field necessary to switch the magnetization of f@xmath38 is significantly larger , around 80 mt , as it has to overcome the planar shape anisotropy .",
    "nevertheless the field to switch f@xmath38 is larger than expected for a single layer of its size and shape .",
    "this is caused by the dipole magnetic field created by the f@xmath33 layer coupling to the magnetization of f@xmath38 .",
    "for the angle dependent measurements we have to make sure that this coupling is canceled out such that it will not influence m@xmath38 when rotating m@xmath33 . from separate measurements",
    "we conclude that the coupling corresponds to a 50 mt field , see appendix [ app_dipole ] .",
    "a constant b of 50 mt in the angle dependent experiments is therefore sufficient to cancel out the dipole coupling field .",
    "note that because we compare amr and asdse measurements directly , measured on the same sample and using the same technique , any small differences between the angle set by the rotation of b and the actual angle , between m@xmath33 and m@xmath33 , has no effect on the ability to compare both curves .",
    "the mr measurement corresponds well with the results found from a comsol multiphysics three - dimensional finite element model ( 3d - fem ) with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "see refs . for a full discussion of the model .",
    "the difference in p@xmath44 for the two f layers is because of the ion mill cleaning of the f@xmath33 layer,@xcite which leads to a stronger spin scattering and can thus be taken as an effective lower p@xmath44 .",
    "the sdse measurement in fig . [ fig : angle_meas](c ) gives the seebeck voltage measured across the stack while sweeping b. the temperature gradient over the stack is produced by sending a 1 ma root mean square current through each pt joule heater .",
    "a clear difference in the seebeck voltage for the parallel and antiparallel case is observed . the sdse signal and the background voltage correspond",
    "well with previously reported results @xcite and with the modeled values , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    for the angle dependent measurements the sample holder is mounted on a rotatable stage with a rotation precision of at least @xmath47 radian by the automated control of a stepper motor .",
    "the sample holder is rotated from @xmath48 to @xmath49 radian with a constant b of 50 mt while recording the voltage across the stack .",
    "m@xmath33 will follow b therefore creating an angle @xmath9 between m@xmath33 and m@xmath38 , see figure [ fig : sample](b ) , equal to the rotation of the sample holder .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_meas](a ) the amr and asdse measurements are plotted together and are normalized by the spin signal from the mr and sdse measurements , respectively . in this way",
    "the angle dependence of both effects can directly be compared .",
    "a small but distinct difference between the two curves is visible , as the asdse is wider than the amr , indicating that @xmath50 starts playing a role . from this",
    "we can conclude that a sha builds up in our stacks , verifying previous results of direct sha measurements.@xcite the tstt , as described in eq .",
    "[ eq : tstt ] , will be affected as well but from the relatively small difference between the amr and asdse curves , of maximum 10% of the total spin signal ( see fig . [",
    "fig : angle_meas](a ) ) , we can assume that this change will be small and in first order can be neglected .",
    "the existence of an sdse suggests that the spin current generated by a thermal gradient across an f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack would produce a tstt .",
    "the experiments discussed in this section are aimed at finding evidence for such a tstt . for this purpose",
    "we use devices with f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack of type b ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sample](c ) ) to investigate the changes in minor loop switching fields .    the magnetic minor loop measurement is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : minor](a ) , where the first harmonic response is plotted as a function of b. here we only look at the switching of the 5 nm thick f@xmath38 layer .",
    "first m@xmath33 and m@xmath38 are saturated parallel by applying a high positive magnetic field .",
    "now b is sweeped towards zero until m@xmath33 switches , bringing the stack into the anti parallel resistance state . by reversing the b field sweep direction , before m@xmath38 switches ,",
    "a minor loop is obtained when m@xmath33 switches back to its original parallel resistance state .",
    "the minor loop should normally be centered around b=0 but is shifted to around b=45 mt in our devices , because of the dipole field coupling between the two f layers .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : minor](b ) the stt switching experiment is given for characterization purposes . on top of the small alternating current ( i@xmath51 ) of 10 @xmath52a , which gives the resistance of the stack via a lock - in detection technique , a direct current ( i@xmath53 ) is sent through the stack responsible for inducing the stt .",
    "sweeping i@xmath53 from -1.5 to + 1.5 ma a stt switching from the parallel to anti parallel state is observed , for a positive i@xmath53 of 0.8 ma , and a reverse switch , for a negative i@xmath53 of -1.2 ma .",
    "a constant b of 40 mt is applied to make sure that we are within the minor loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig : minor](a ) ) , where both the parallel and anti parallel magnetization alignment constitute a stable state .",
    "the experiments discussed above show that the switching fields b@xmath33 and b@xmath38 in the minor loop are changed by stt , or in other words the barrier going from the p to ap state and vice versa is changed .",
    "measuring these two switching fields as a function of i@xmath53 , through the f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack , therefore quantifies the response of the sample to stt , at currents below the stt switching current .",
    "[ fig : dep](a ) gives this evolution of b@xmath33 and b@xmath38 , where every measurement point is an average switching field from 5 consecutively obtained minor loops .",
    "b@xmath38 clearly shifts to lower values for higher i@xmath53 values , almost reaching 40 mt at an i@xmath53 of 0.8 ma , corresponding well to the stt switching current observed in fig . [",
    "fig : minor](b ) .",
    "b@xmath33 on the other hand only shows a very small decrease consistent with magnetic phase diagrams found for similar stacks.@xcite    for tstt a similar change in b@xmath33 and b@xmath38 should be observed when increasing the temperature gradient across the stack . in the measurement presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep](b ) this is investigated by determining these switching fields as a function of i@xmath54 , sent through the pt joule heaters .",
    "the results are plotted versus i@xmath55 because the joule heating scales quadratically with i@xmath54 . indeed a clear quadratic decrease of b@xmath38 is observed as one would expect for tstt . however b@xmath33 now seems to slightly increase , instead of showing a small decrease as seen for the stt measurement .",
    "this could indicate that the changes in b@xmath33 and b@xmath38 are not purely due to tstt , but overall heating of f@xmath38 plays an important role as well .",
    "namely , overall heating will lower the coercive field of the f@xmath38 layer . to further investigate this we measured the evolution of the switching fields as a function of the overall temperature of the device , without any stt or temperature gradient applied .",
    "a heating element together with a thermometer , positioned underneath and in good thermal contact with the sample , was used to controllably set the overall temperature of our device .",
    "[ fig : dep](c ) gives the results up to a temperature of 80@xmath56c , showing a very similar behavior as the `` thermal '' stt dependent measurement in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep](b ) .    to determine if the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep](b ) are dominated by overall heating the temperature of the f@xmath38 layer as function of i@xmath54 needs to be known .",
    "experimentally this is difficult to determine and therefore we use our 3d finite element model , successfully used in section [ sec : exp_results ] as well as numerous previously reported measurements.@xcite the modeled temperature of f@xmath38 versus i@xmath57 is given in fig . [",

    "f@xmath38 reaches a temperature of 57 @xmath56c .",
    "the same i@xmath54 gives a b@xmath58 of 52 mt , according to the measurement in fig .",

    "[ fig : dep](c ) . in other words",

    "[ fig : dep](b ) seems to be dominated by the overall heating of the f@xmath38 layer .",

    "( b ) resistance of the stack as function of direct current ( i@xmath53 ) sent through it .",
    "the switching from the anti parallel resistance state to the parallel state and vice versa is cause by the spin - transfer torque induced by i@xmath53 .",
    "a constant b of 40 mt is applied to ensure that we are in the middle of the minor loop , where both the parallel and anti parallel magnetization alignment constitute a stable state . ]",
    "the asdse measurement presented in section [ sec : exp_results ] shows that the spin heat accumulation in our devices will influence the tstt , however this changed is assumed to be small and can effectively be neglected . applying a temperature gradient across an f@xmath2n@xmath2f stack , presented in section [ sec : tt ] ,",
    "shows no evidence of tstt .",
    "this we attribute to the dominance of overall heating of the magnetic layer , masking the response due to tstt .",
    "if we indeed neglect the relatively small efficiency difference in tstt and current driven stt , then eq . [ eq : stt ] and [ eq : tstt ] describe the torques , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 needed to produce the same amount of stt , for a certain @xmath59 through the stack , is then found by setting @xmath60 and gives @xmath61 where r is the resistance of the spin active part of the stack @xcite and @xmath62 is the current through the stack as plotted on the x - axis in fig .",

    "s=-18 @xmath52v / k and for p and p the values found in section [ sec : exp_results ] we get ; @xmath64 $ ] @xmath62 . in order to switch the f@xmath38 layer using current driven stt an @xmath59 of 0.8 ma is required ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : minor ] ( b ) ) , which then corresponds to a @xmath12 of 230 k , across the spin active part @xcite of the f@xmath33 layer , for pure tstt driven switching .",
    "it can safely be said that such a large steady state @xmath12 can not be applied across such a short length and will lead to a significant increase in the background temperature .",

    "[ fig : dep](b ) would therefore need a @xmath12 of @xmath66  k , across the spin active part of the stack @xcite , if caused purely by tstt .",
    "the model gives a @xmath67 k for the largest joule heating current , which would mean tstt is only responsible for a maximum of @xmath010% of the observed b@xmath58 change .    in conclusion we can say that although the angle dependent measurements show that a thermal gradient will induce a tstt , it is small and difficult to distinguish from overall heating effects .",
    "overall heating leads to a lowering of the energy switching barrier for both the p and ap state , such that b@xmath33 and b@xmath38 move towards each other and gives a narrower minor loop . in the case of stt ,",
    "either induced by a thermal or voltage gradient , the two switching fields should move in the same direction providing a way to distinguishing it from overall heating .",
    "our results show that , in steady state experiments , it is difficult to avoid overall heating from being the dominant effect , unless the magnetic layer under investigation is connected directly to an almost perfect heat sink .",
    "an alternative approach would be to use use short heat pulses and look at time dependent signals as discussed in ref . for tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) structures .    a combined effect of the lowering of the switching barrier by overall heating together with tstt could of course",

    "<S> we investigate the relation between thermal spin - transfer torque ( tstt ) and the spin - dependent seebeck effect ( sdse ) , which produces a spin current when a temperature gradient is applied across a metallic ferromagnet , in nanopillar metallic spin valves . comparing its angular dependence ( asdse ) with the angle dependent magnetoresistance ( amr ) measurements on the same device , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to verify that a small spin heat accumulation builds up in our devices . from the sdse measurement and the observed current driven stt switching current of 0.8 ma in our spin valve devices </S>",
    "<S> , it was estimated that a temperature difference of 230  k is needed to produce an equal amount of tstt . </S>",
    "<S> experiments specifically focused on investigating tstt show a response that is dominated by overall heating of the magnetic layer . comparing it to the current driven stt experiments we estimate that only @xmath010% of the response is due to tstt . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that switching dominated by tstt requires a direct coupling to a perfect heat sink to minimize the effect of overall heating . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the combined effect of heating , stt and tstt could prove useful for inducing magnetization switching when further investigated and optimized . </S>"
