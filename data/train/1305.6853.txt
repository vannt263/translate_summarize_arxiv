    "ultra - low thermal conductivity ( @xmath0 ) of crystal lattice or phonons is a long - term investigated topic.@xcite it is directly related to the applications of thermoelectric materials and thermal barrier materials . introducing structural imperfections into the samples , such as impurities and defects ,",
    "is always a useful method to increase the phonon scattering and decrease the phonon thermal conductivity.@xcite in an extreme case , the amorphous solids are known to have very weak heat transport of phonons.@xcite because of the lack of the long - range periodicity of the atom positions in amorphous materials , the phonon mean free path is very short even at very low temperatures.@xcite however , in many cases , it is not a suitable way to obtain small phonon thermal conductivity by simply using amorphous materials .",
    "for example , the highly efficient thermoelectric materials should have simultaneous low thermal conductivity and high electric conductivity.@xcite this requirement can not be met in those samples with significant crystal imperfections or in amorphous solids . in other words , to obtain very small phonon thermal conductivity in bulk single crystals is still a challenging task .",
    "there may be some chances in magnetic materials since some recent works have revealed that the magnetic fluctuations could yield strong scattering on phonons .",
    "the magnetic excitations can work as either heat carriers or phonon scatterers.@xcite in those materials exhibiting long - range magnetic order , the strong magnetic fluctuations near the critical region of phase transition can scatter phonons rather strongly.@xcite a recent example is the hexagonal manganite homno@xmath3.@xcite the phonon thermal conductivity was found to be suppressed by two orders of magnitude at the regime of antiferromagnetic ( af ) transition of ho@xmath4 ions . however , such scattering is not effective at lower temperatures when the long - range order is well established.@xcite in addition , the phonon thermal conductivities of these materials are still much larger than those of the amorphous materials .",
    "even stronger magnetic scattering effect is therefore to be expected in those materials with strong spin fluctuations and no long - range order .",
    "this is what the spin - liquid materials may exhibit .",
    "another requirement for strong phonon scattering in magnetically disordered state is that the coupling between spin and lattice should be strong .",
    "geometrical spin frustration is very promising to result in a three - dimensional spin liquid.@xcite a well studied material is the rare - earth pyrochlore tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite although the ground state of this materials is still a controversial question , most of the previous studies evidenced that it is a cooperative paramagnet down to milli - kelvin temperatures , much lower than the energy scale of the af interactions .",
    "the single - ion ground state is a degenerate doublet and the tb@xmath4 spin has an ising - like anisotropy with the easy axis along the local [ 111 ] axis.@xcite in addition , the peculiar crystal field effect yields a pronounced magnetoelastic effect , which was verified by x - ray diffraction and demonstrated that the coupling between spin and lattice is very strong.@xcite as a result , an anomalously strong structural fluctuation has been observed in zero field.@xcite therefore , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 seems to meet the requirements for exhibiting strong spin - phonon scattering . in this work",
    ", the thermal conductivity of high - quality tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals is measured down to 0.3 k. it is found that in a broad temperature regime the thermal conductivity is extremely small and comparable to that of the amorphous materials . in particular , the mean free path of phonons is found to be as low as 20 nm at 4 k and 34 orders of magnitude smaller than the sample size at subkelvin temperatures , and is even shorter than that of amorphous materials.@xcite this result shows an exceptional case of very low phonon thermal conductivity in an insulating single crystal .",
    "the strong spin fluctuation in the spin - liquid - like state is the main mechanism of the phonon scattering .",
    "both the magnetic - field - induced increase of @xmath0 and the comparison of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 with y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 also confirm the magnetic origin of this phonon - glass - like behavior .",
    "high - quality tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals were grown by the floating - zone technique.@xcite these crystals could be grown well under different oxygen pressures and growth rates . tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals were grown in 0.4 mpa pure oxygen with a growth rate of 2.5 mm / h and in 0.25 mpa pure oxygen with a rate of 3 mm / h , respectively .",
    "y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal was grown in mixed oxygen and argon with a ratio of 4:1 and at a growth rate of 4 mm / h .",
    "the thermal conductivities were measured using a conventional steady - state technique and two different processes : ( i ) using a  one heater , two thermometers \" technique in a @xmath5he refrigerator and a 14 t magnet at temperature regime of 0.3  20 k ; ( ii ) using a chromel - constantan thermocouple in a pulse - tube refrigerator for zero - field data above 5 k.@xcite",
    "note that a careful precalibration of resistor ( ruo@xmath1 ) sensors is indispensable for the precise thermal conductivity measurements in high magnetic fields and at low temperatures .",

    "the width and thickness of these two samples are displayed .",
    "( b ) comparison of the zero - field thermal conductivity among tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals having similar sample widths .",
    "inset to panel ( a ) shows the phonon mean free paths of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( sample @xmath6 ) and y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2.,width=264 ]    figure 1(a ) shows the zero - field thermal conductivities of two tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 samples with very different dimensions ( 2.91@xmath70.66@xmath70.16 mm@xmath5 and 3.31@xmath72.43@xmath71.84 mm@xmath5 ) .",
    "the heat currents were applied along the length direction , which was along the [ 111 ] axis of crystal lattice .",
    "there are several remarkable features in these two curves that point to a phonon - glass - like behavior of these single - crystal samples .",
    "first , the magnitudes of @xmath0 are very small and there is no any signature of the so - called phonon peaks at low temperatures",
    ". it is well known that the @xmath8 of insulators usually exhibits a pronounced peak at low temperatures ( 1020 k),@xcite which is a characteristic of phonon heat transport .",
    "the absence of phonon peak in a high - quality single crystal is actually quite unusual and indicates a strong phonon scattering effect .",
    "in addition , the overall temperature dependence of @xmath0 is very similar to what the amorphous solids exhibit , in which the phonons behave as a glassy state .",
    "second , the mean free path of phonons is found to be extremely short in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals .",
    "the phononic thermal conductivity can be expressed by the kinetic formula @xmath9,@xcite where @xmath10 is the phonon specific heat at low temperatures , @xmath11 is the average velocity and @xmath12 is the mean free path of phonons . using the @xmath13 value obtained from specific - heat measurements,@xcite",
    "the phonon velocity can be calculated and then the mean free path is obtained from the @xmath0.@xcite the inset to fig .",
    "1(a ) shows the calculated @xmath12 at low temperatures of the big sample , which is only @xmath14 20 nm at 4 k. even when lowering temperature to 0.3 k , @xmath12 is shorter than 1000 nm and is 34 orders of magnitude smaller than the geometrical size of sample .",
    "note that the mean free path is so short that it is even smaller than the typical magnitudes in the amorphous materials.@xcite in contrast , the microscopic phonon scatterings in usual single crystals , such as the phonon - phonon scattering and scattering by various crystal defects , would be quenched at very low temperatures and the mean free path could reach the sample size .",
    "this is known as the phonon boundary scattering limit.@xcite it means that at temperatures as low as 0.3 k the phonon scattering in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals is still very strong .",
    "note that this can not be caused by the crystal defects since the temperature is low enough .",
    "third , the comparison of two samples with very different sizes also confirmed the absence of phonon boundary scattering . in usual crystals , when the phonon mean free path is long enough to be comparable to the sample size , the thermal conductivity is proportional to the sample size.@xcite however , the two sets of data in fig .",
    "1(a ) indicate that the @xmath0 values are essentially independent on the size , which also evidences that the mean free path of phonons must be significantly shorter than the sample size .",
    "it is necessary to discuss the role of magnetic excitations in the heat transport of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "although the nature of the ground state is not fully understood , it is most likely a spin - liquid - like disordered state , in which the magnetic excitations are short - range correlated spin fluctuations and were evidenced by the low - energy spectra of neutron measurements.@xcite from the extremely low thermal conductivity of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , it can be easily concluded that the spin fluctuations strongly scatter phonons rather than act as heat carriers .",
    "figure 1(b ) compares the thermal conductivity of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 with y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 has the same crystal structure with tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 but is nonmagnetic .",
    "it is clearly seen that the thermal conductivity of y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( having size of 4.51@xmath70.63@xmath70.15 mm@xmath5 ) behaves exactly like the usual insulting crystals , with a phonon peak at about 15 k. for a more quantitative comparison , the phonon mean free path of y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal was also calculated and shown in the inset to fig . 1(a).@xcite at low temperatures , it is 23 orders of magnitude larger than that of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and at 0.3 k it reaches a large value ( @xmath14 2@xmath710@xmath15 nm ) , close to the averaged sample width , suggesting that the boundary scattering limit is almost established .",
    "apparently , the small difference of lattice parameters of y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 can not lead to so large difference of phonon transport .",
    "the main difference between these two materials is their magnetisms .",
    "therefore , it is naturally concluded that the magnetic scattering , due to the strong magnetic fluctuations in the quantum - spin - liquid state of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , is the main mechanism for the extremely strong phonon scattering .",
    "the heat transport of another material , tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 , seems to support this point .",
    "tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 is stoichiometrically a mixture of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , which would be expected to exhibit a weaker heat transport than two parent compounds.@xcite the high - temperature ( @xmath16 10 k ) data indeed show such a result .",
    "however , at very low temperatures the @xmath0 of tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 is clearly larger than that of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "since the dilution of tb@xmath4 ions by the nonmagnetic y@xmath4 ions would suppress the spin correlations , the magnetic scattering on phonons is reasonably weakened .",
    "of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal for magnetic field along ( a , c ) and perpendicular to ( b , d ) the [ 111 ] axis , respectively .",
    "all the data were taken on one sample ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the magnetic field perpendicular to the [ 111 ] direction is actually along another special direction [ 1@xmath170].,width=321 ]    if the strong phonon scattering of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals is magnetically originated , the magnetic field is expected to be able to strongly affect the heat transport , which is confirmed by the field dependence measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2 shows how the magnetic field , parallel to either the [ 111 ] direction or the vertical one , changes the thermal conductivity .",
    "a striking finding is that at very low temperatures the @xmath0 can be enhanced by 3040 times with increasing field .",
    "to our knowledge , there has been no report of such a strong magnetothermal conductivity effect in any other magnetic materials . in principle , it is understandable that the magnetic field can suppress the spin fluctuations and therefore weaken the phonon scattering . in this sense , a 3040 times increase of @xmath0 in fields is actually far below the expectation .",
    "considering that the mean free path of phonons is 34 orders of magnitude smaller than the geometrical size of the sample , one may expect more than 1000 times enhancement of @xmath0 if the magnetic field is strong enough to smear out all the magnetic scattering on phonons .",
    "it is notable that the field dependencies are quite different for two field directions . for @xmath18",
    "[ 111 ] , the very - low-@xmath19 @xmath0 is nearly field independent for @xmath20 2 t and then increases monotonically with field .",
    "it seems that the magnetic field along this direction just simply suppresses the spin fluctuations .",
    "the effect of magnetic field along [ 110 ] direction had been well studied,@xcite in which case the tb@xmath4 spins were thought to lying on two sets of chains along the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath170 ] directions .",
    "the spins on chains parallel to the field direction ( so - called @xmath21 chains ) align along the local [ 111 ] axis with a component parallel to the magnetic field . whereas the spins on chains perpendicular to the field direction ( the @xmath13 chains ) favor an af order at high fields .",
    "this field - induced order had already been revealed by the neutron scattering.@xcite it was found that the field - induced elastic neutron scattering intensity increased gradually above 2 t and at subkelvin temperatures , which is qualitatively consistent with the increase of @xmath22 above 2 t. at higher temperatures ( @xmath16 3 k ) , the field - induced magnetic order was hardly to be observed;@xcite correspondingly , the @xmath0 shows much weaker enhancement with increasing field .    for @xmath23 [ 111 ] ,",
    "both the field and temperature dependencies show much more complicated behaviors , compared to the case of @xmath18 [ 111 ] .",
    "the 0.36-k @xmath22 curve shows a three - peak ( at 2.5 , 8.5 , and 11.5 t ) or three - dip ( at 0.5 , 6 , and 10.5 t ) feature between 0 and 14 t ( see fig .",
    "3(d ) also ) . in principle , the field - induced enhancement of @xmath0 in this case is likely to have the same mechanism as the case of @xmath18 [ 111 ] , i.e. , some field - induced magnetic order . however , it is hard to image so complicated magnetic transitions if each anomaly on the @xmath22 curves corresponds to a magnetic transition .",
    "there actually has been few experimental studies on the possible field - induced changes of magnetic properties for @xmath24 [ 111 ] .",
    "an early neutron scattering experiment had found that the magnetic field along the [ 111 ] axis could also induce an af order.@xcite the elastic neutron scattering intensity was found to increase with field up to 23 t and become nearly saturated , which seems to have some correspondence with the sharp increase of @xmath0 at 12 t. however , either the nature or the spin structure of this ordered phase were not resolved.@xcite magnetic susceptibility data taken at several tens of milli - kelvin temperatures also indicated a shoulder - like anomaly at about 1.2 t,@xcite which is likely related to a field - induced order .",
    "more recent experiments indicated that this anomaly exists and shows a weak temperature dependence at temperature scale of several hundred milli - kelvins.@xcite however , such susceptibility measurements did not reveal any other clear anomaly for fields up to 14 t.@xcite based on these existing experimental results , it is not likely that there are some multiple magnetic transitions in high fields along the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "a recent susceptibility study has revealed that tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is likely to exhibit a quantum - spin - ice ground state and the magnetic field along the [ 111 ] axis can drive transitions very similar to those in the spin - ice material dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite however , these transitions between the  quantum - spin - ice \" , the  quantum - kagom - ice \" , and the  three - in - one - out \" states occur in rather low fields ( @xmath25 1 t ) and at very low temperatures ( @xmath25 150 mk).@xcite therefore , these low - field transitions are apparently irrelevant to the @xmath22 behaviors in fig .",
    "there should be some other reasons for the complicated @xmath22 behavior besides the field - induced orders or transitions .",
    "of tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal for magnetic field along and perpendicular to the [ 111 ] axis , respectively .",
    "( c ) magnetic field dependencies of @xmath0 of tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal for @xmath24 [ 111 ] .",
    "( d ) comparison of the @xmath22 data at 0.36 k between tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2.,width=321 ]    similar field - dependence measurements have been done on the tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . the effects of magnetic field in this sample are also very strong , but weaker than those in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it is understandable if the low thermal conductivity of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is due to the strong magnetic scattering on phonons and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 has weaker magnetic fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , there are several remarkable phenomena in the transport properties of tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the high - field induced enhancement of @xmath0 for @xmath18 [ 111 ] is several times weaker in tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 than that in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "since half of the tb@xmath4 ions are replaced by y@xmath4 , the exchange interactions between magnetic ions are weakened and it is probably difficult to form the field - induced magnetic order of the @xmath13 chains . in this sense ,",
    "the stronger high - field enhancement of @xmath0 in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 has some relationship to the spin orders , which can result in weaker magnetic scattering than the isolated magnetic ions in tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "second , the @xmath22 isotherms for @xmath23 [ 111 ] show comparably large magnetothermal conductivity but rather different field dependencies , compared with those of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "in particular , each low-@xmath19 @xmath22 curve displays two rather broad peaks at about 3 and 11.5 t and a shallow valley at 89 t. however , the two peak positions are nearly the same as two of the tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 peaks , as shown in fig",
    "this indicates that the @xmath22 behaviors in @xmath23 [ 111 ] may have close relationship to the single - ion properties , like the crystal - field excitations .",
    "ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals in magnetic field along the [ 111 ] axis.,width=226 ]    figure 4 shows the specific heat of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals at low temperatures and in the [ 111 ] fields .",
    "our zero - field specific heat data of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 are essentially consistent with an earlier work.@xcite two broad peaks or humps at about 0.7 and 6 k could be related to the ground - state and the first - excitation doublets of tb@xmath4 crystal - field levels , broadened by the exchange interactions.@xcite in magnetic fields along the [ 111 ] axis , the two anomaly peaks react sensitively to the field . in high fields , only the high-@xmath19 peak remains and shifts to higher temperatures , while the low-@xmath19 one disappears at fields above 2 t. note that the lowest-@xmath19 upturns of specific heat in high fields is likely some nuclear spin contribution.@xcite in tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the low-@xmath19 anomaly moved significantly to @xmath14 2 k and the high-@xmath19 one moves slightly to @xmath14 8 k and becomes much weaker in the magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the specific - heat data do not show any obvious signature for the possible magnetic order and the field - induced changes are mainly related to the crystal - field excitations .",
    "let us discuss about the possibility of the crystal - field effects on the exotic field dependencies of @xmath0 in the [ 111 ] field .",
    "since the low - field transition to some af order state can significantly weaken the phonon scattering , a monotonic increase of @xmath0 with increasing field is expected , similar to the case of @xmath18 [ 111 ] .",
    "thus , the high - field behavior of @xmath0 can occur if there are resonant phonon scattering by the crystal - field excitations@xcite at those particular fields like 6 and 10.5 t , and probably another one higher than 14 t. in this regard , the crystal - field levels of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 were rather clearly determined at least at 4 k. the ground state and the first excitation are non - kramers doublets with @xmath14 18 k separation , and higher levels are singlets.@xcite considering the zeeman splitting of the doublets , one can figure out two possible phonon resonant scatterings at 0.36 k. the first one is that the splitting of the ground - state doublet can produce a resonant scattering at about 0.2 t , when the energy splitting is about 3.8@xmath26.@xcite the second one is expected when the lower branch of the first - excitation level becomes close enough to the ground - state level ( with interval of 3.8@xmath26 ) , which occurs at about 16 t. note that due to the strong anisotropy of the tb@xmath4 spins , the land factor is about 1014 for the [ 111 ] direction and zero for the direction perpendicular to the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "@xcite therefore , the resonant scattering by the crystal - field excitations can work only for fields along [ 111 ] .",
    "it is reasonable that only with @xmath23 [ 111 ] the @xmath22 and high - field @xmath8 shows the dip - like features , which could be due to the resonant scattering.@xcite however , the above estimated resonant scattering fields are significantly different from the dip fields in @xmath22 .",
    "another possible reason for the anisotropic field dependence of @xmath0 is related to the magnetostriction , which was experimentally found to be strongly anisotropic also.@xcite the existing data indicated that the longitudinal and transverse magnetostrictions only showed smooth functions of field up to 6 t at 4 k. however , since the magnetoelastic coupling is quickly enhanced with lowering temperatures,@xcite some drastic field dependencies of magnetostriction can be expected at subkelvin temperatures .",
    "when the remarkable changes of lattice parameters and elastic constants are induced by the magnetic field , lowering crystal symmetry and structural phase transitions could occur in strong field.@xcite such effects on phonon heat transport was recently observed in another rare - earth pyrochlore dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite nevertheless , very - low-@xmath19 measurements of the magnetostriction would be useful for clarifying the mechanism of the magnetothermal conductivity effect in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "an extremely low thermal conductivity was observed in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "the short mean free path of phonons points to a phonon - glass - like behavior of this material .",
    "both the field dependencies of @xmath0 and the comparison with y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tbyti@xmath1o@xmath2 indicate that the phonons are strongly scattered by the spin fluctuations , whereas the field - induced changes of magnetism are remained to be investigated .",
