    "the quantum - mechanical understanding of the physics of actinide compounds presents a challenge due to the intricate nature of the partially filled @xmath0-shell .",
    "compared to the rare - earths , for which the @xmath8-states are most often completely localized , e.g. exhibiting atomic - like multiplet structure , the @xmath0 states in the actinides are less inert and can play a significant role in bonding , depending on the specific actinide element and the chemical environment .",
    "this is most convincingly demonstrated in the elemental metals , for which a localization transition occurs when going from pu to am . in the early actinides ,",
    "th , pa , u , np , and the @xmath9-phase of pu , the relatively delocalized 5@xmath10-electrons actively contribute to bonding , and their atomic volumes decrease in a parabolic fashion , similarly to the behavior seen across the transition metal series.@xcite in am , the @xmath10-electron localization is accompanied by an abrupt @xmath11 increase in the atomic volume , and for the heavier elements , cm , bk and cf , the specific volume either remains constant or decreases only slightly .",
    "pu lies at the borderline , and its very complex phase diagram implies that the @xmath10-electron properties are of particularly intricate nature . depending on the chemical properties of the ligands , the actinide compounds may exhibit different degrees of @xmath10-electron localization for the same actinide element .    over the past 30 years , the local spin density ( lsd ) and semi - local ( generalized gradient - gga ) approximations to density",
    "functional theory@xcite have proven very useful and accurate in describing bonding properties of solids with weakly correlated electrons , demonstrating that the cohesive energy data for the homogeneous electron gas , that underlie these approximations , are representative of the conduction states in real materials . however , when 4@xmath10-electrons are involved , the atomic picture with localized partially filled @xmath10-shells is usually a better starting point for calculations",
    ". the most well known extensions of lsd , capable of describing electron localization , include the self - interaction corrected ( sic)-lsd,@xcite lda+u,@xcite and orbital polarization methods.@xcite    it is possible to get a reasonable description of rare - earth materials with the lsd method by including a partially occupied @xmath10-shell into the core and projecting out the @xmath10-degrees of freedom from the valence bands.@xcite in such calculations , a combination of density functional theory with input from experimental data is used to describe bonding electrons and the atomic @xmath12 configuration , respectively",
    ". the sic - lsd method can be viewed as effectively including an integer number of @xmath10-electrons in the core , however without restricting the unoccupied @xmath10-degrees of freedom .",
    "the localized @xmath8 electrons in the rare earth metals and compounds have been well described by the sic - lsd method.@xcite intermediate valent yb compounds have been described@xcite as a localized @xmath13 configuration plus a narrow @xmath10-band state pinned to the fermi level .",
    "the free yb atom is divalent with a completely filled @xmath14 shell .",
    "thus , the destabilization of the localized @xmath10-manifold , which occurs in the solid state , is described in the sic - lsd method by introducing two kinds of @xmath10-electrons.@xcite an integer number of @xmath10-electrons are localized while a non - integer number of hybridized band-@xmath10 electrons is determined by the self - consistent position of the fermi level .",
    "a similar picture has emerged from calculations applying the lda+u approach to tm compounds.@xcite the number of localized @xmath10-electrons leads to a definition of valency of the actinide ions , given as the integer number of electrons available for band formation . due to a substantial @xmath10-character of the valence bands ,",
    "this valency is not the same as that determined by the total @xmath10-electron count , which includes both localized and itinerant @xmath10-electrons , and which is usually non - integral .",
    "therefore , the most stable actinide valency in a given compound is determined by the balance between the localization energy and band formation energy ( hybridization energy ) . in section 2 of the present paper ,",
    "the sic - lsd method is briefly described . in section 3 ,",
    "the results for selected cases are presented and discussed , notably the @xmath1-phase of pu , the actinide monopnictides and monochalcogenides , the puo@xmath2 compound , and the ux@xmath3 intermetallics .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 4 .",
    "+    the electronic configuration of the actinide atoms is [ rn]@xmath15 for u , @xmath16 for np , [ rn]@xmath17 for pu , [ rn]@xmath18 for am , and [ rn]@xmath19 for cm . in the solid state",
    ", the relative proportions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath10 electrons will change due to hybridization and charge transfer . the @xmath10 orbitals",
    "participate in bonding through their overlap with the @xmath10 and @xmath21 orbitals on neighbouring actinide ions , as well as , with the valence orbitals of the ligands .",
    "either of these interactions lead to a broadening of the atomic @xmath10-level into an @xmath10 resonance , which one might hope to describe in two opposite limits , either as a hybridized band ( as in the standard lsd picture ) , or as an atomic - like delta - function ( by including a partially filled @xmath12 shell into the atomic core and decoupling all the other @xmath10-degrees of freedom , i.e. , completely ignoring a possible @xmath10-electron contribution to bonding ) .",
    "these two extremal scenarios are depicted schematically in figs .",
    "[ schemados]a and [ schemados]b , respectively , while the sic - lsd scenario , which can be viewed as an interpolation between the two , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ schemados]c .    in the sic - lsd approach",
    "@xcite the lsd total energy functional is corrected for the spurious self - interaction of each occupied state @xmath9 : @xmath22 where the self - interaction correction , @xmath23 , for a given state @xmath9 , is defined as the sum of the hartree and exchange - correlation energies : @xmath24+e_{xc}^{lsd}[n_{\\alpha } ] .\\ ] ] this correction vanishes for an itinerant state , and therefore the sic - lsd functional for such a state coincides with the conventional lsd functional . to benefit from the self - interaction correction , an electron state needs to spatially localize , which costs band formation energy due to loss of hybridization . whether this is favorable depends on the relative values of the hybridization energy and the self - interaction correction energy .",
    "hence , the latter is identified with the localization energy .",
    "the rationale behind the functional in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is that for a delocalized electron the interaction with a given atom is well described by the mean - field lsd potential .",
    "in contrast , the appropriate potential for a localized electron , due to a large wigner delay time , will be corrected for the fact that other electrons on that atom rearrange in response to the presence of this localized electron .",
    "the self - interaction correction depends on the spatial distribution of the @xmath10 orbital , while the hybridization energy depends on the overlap of a given @xmath10 orbital with the @xmath10 and @xmath21 orbitals on the neighbouring actinide sites , and valence orbitals on the ligand sites .",
    "the @xmath10-electron which has become localized , by benefiting from the self - interaction correction , can no longer hybridize with the conduction electron bands to give rise to any band - related features or valency fluctuations . however , the @xmath10-states which have not been explicitly localized can hybridize with the conduction electrons and form fully or partially occupied bands ( see fig .",
    "[ schemados]c ) .    in the sic - lsd formulation",
    "one deals with two types of @xmath10 electrons , the localized and hybridized @xmath10 electrons , as first implicated by gschneider@xcite in relation to rare earths . by assuming different @xmath25 configurations of localized electrons , various valency configurations can be realized and studied in detail . within sic",
    "- lsd the valency is defined as the integer number of actinide valence electrons which are available for band formation , i. e. : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the atomic number , @xmath28 is the number of core ( and semi - core ) electrons ( which for actinides is 86 ) , and @xmath29 is the number of localized @xmath10-electrons on the actinide sites .",
    "thus , e.g. a trivalent configuration of the actinide ions u@xmath30 , np@xmath30 , pu@xmath30 , am@xmath30 , and cm@xmath30 , is realized by localizing three , ( @xmath31 configuration ) , four ( @xmath32 ) , five ( @xmath33 ) , six ( @xmath34 ) , and seven ( @xmath35 ) @xmath10 electrons on the respective actinide atoms .",
    "for a given @xmath12 configuration , the minimum in the total energy as a function of lattice parameter determines the equilibrium lattice constant . by comparing the total energy minima for different @xmath25 configurations",
    ", the global groundstate configuration and lattice constant can be determined . in selecting the @xmath12 configuration the hund s rules",
    "are usually followed by alligning spins and maximizing the orbital moment in the direction opposite to the spins ( for less than half - filled shells , or in parallel to the spins for more than half - filled shells ) . during the iterations towards self - consistency",
    "the localized states are allowed to relax , although generally they do not change much .",
    "the sic - lsd scheme has been implemented@xcite within the tight - binding linear - muffin - tin orbitals ( tb - lmto ) method.@xcite the actinide semi - core @xmath36 and @xmath37 states have been described with a separate energy panel .",
    "spin - orbit coupling has been fully included in the self - consistency cycles . for simplicity , for systems discussed here , we have assumed ferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments .",
    "electronic structure calculations treating @xmath10-electrons as band states describe quite succesfully the equilibrium volumes of the early actinide metals.@xcite in an early study of am , skriver et al.@xcite found the @xmath10-electron localization , signalled by the onset of spin - polarization , giving rise to an almost full , and hence nonbonding , spin polarized @xmath38 band .",
    "also , the high pressure phases of am have been succesfully described by the standard lsd theory .",
    "@xcite recently , the sic - lsd method was applied to the series of actinide metals@xcite from np to fm , correctly describing the itinerant nature of np , the trivalency of am , cm , bk and cf , and the shift to divalency in es and fm .",
    "pu turns out to be the most delicate case , being situated on the borderline between the itinerant and well localized actinides .",
    "the groundstate @xmath9-phase is well reproduced by lda calculations@xcite , but the high temperature @xmath1-phase is peculiar .",
    "the crystal structure is high - symmetry fcc , it has the largest specific volume of all pu allotropes ( 25 % larger than that of @xmath9-pu ) , and the thermal expansion coefficient is negative . it has long been recognized that these facts are connected to a higher degree of localization of the @xmath10-electrons in the @xmath1-phase , but on the other hand the volume is still @xmath39 smaller than that of am .    -pu .",
    "dashed curves assume @xmath40 coupled localized @xmath12 shell , black curves assume @xmath41 coupling .",
    "[ pu - fig ] , title=\"fig : \" ] +    we have investigated the @xmath1-phase of pu within the sic - lsd approach . the total energy of a number of localization scenarios are summarized in figure [ pu - fig ] . in constructing the localized @xmath12 shells we have considered either @xmath41 coupling ( black curves ) or @xmath40 coupling ( dashed curves ) of the @xmath10-states . in the former case ,",
    "all @xmath10-states are taken to be eigenstates of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath43 quantum number @xmath44 corresponding to spin - up , in accordance with hund s first rule , and @xmath42 quantum numbers occupied in the sequence @xmath45 to comply with hund s second rule ( for less than half filled shells ) . in the latter case ,",
    "one - electron @xmath10-states are taken as eigenstates of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath47 quantum number occupied in the sequence @xmath49 .",
    "it is important to stress that these are only the starting configurations of the localized states . ultimately , the localized states are determined self - consistently by the sic - lsd total energy minimization , but in practice the symmetry of the initial state tends to be preserved during iterations towards self - consistency . in other words",
    "there are energy barriers for a sic state to drastically alter its symmetry .",
    "one notices a significant energy gain for the configurations with large spin localized @xmath12 shells .",
    "the lowest energy is found for a localized @xmath41 coupled @xmath50 shell , corresponding to trivalent pu atoms.@xcite the equilibrium volume is 218 @xmath51 , which is 30 % larger than the experimental volume of @xmath1-pu .",
    "clearly , this is not the appropriate representative of @xmath1-pu .",
    "one more localized @xmath10-electron leads to an even larger volume and also a larger total energy , while fewer localized electrons do lead to smaller equilibrium volume but also larger total energy .",
    "the best agreement with the experimental volume within the @xmath41 coupling scheme is obtained for the @xmath52 localized scenario .",
    "the @xmath40 coupling scheme leads to a completely different picture . in this case the scenarios with localized @xmath52 ,",
    "@xmath31 , and @xmath53 shells are almost degenerate in energy , with @xmath31 having the lowest energy , and an equilibrium volume @xmath54 _ smaller _ than the experimental @xmath1-pu volume .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn here is that the lsd provides a poor account of the energetics of @xmath1-pu : the exchange energy gained by the formation of large aligned spins is overestimated and leads to the wrong representation of the ground state . by taking @xmath40 coupled localized shells , one artificially turns the spin - density contribution to the total energy off , and an improved description is obtained .",
    "this does * not * mean that the @xmath40 coupled pu @xmath31 shell is the correct ground state of pu .",
    "rather , the study demonstrates that more complicated ground states are called for . within the restricted one - electron picture",
    "the @xmath40 coupled localized shell is a better representation of the true ground state .",
    "firstly , the true ground state must describe appropriately the spin fluctuations leading to the quenching of the pu moment , secondly it is also likely that fluctuations in the number of localized @xmath10-electrons are needed .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath1-pu is a special case in the actinide series .",
    "when going to am , the @xmath41 ground state obtained with the sic - lsd approach is quite adequate , leading to a localized @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 ground state .",
    "the equilibrium volume is @xmath59 larger than the experimental volume , which is acceptable .",
    "the @xmath40 coupled ground state is also @xmath55 , @xmath58 , in this case with a volume only @xmath60 larger than the experimental volume , but there is not such a drastic difference between the two representations for the well localized am case as for pu .",
    "hence , the failure of the sic - lsd in describing the highly correlated @xmath1-phase of pu has been traced back to the large magnetic moment on pu , persisting in the sic - lsd description . by artificially setting the exchange interaction to zero , a much improved lattice",
    "constant has been obtained , as also found by refs . @xcite and @xcite . since experiments find pu to be non - magnetic",
    ", one must conclude that the mean - field approaches of lsd and sic - lsd overestimate the tendency towards magnetic moment formation , by not taking into account quantum fluctuations in the @xmath10-shell .",
    "recently , savrasov _",
    "et al._@xcite have presented a promising way of treating dynamical fluctuations and applied it successfully to @xmath1-pu .      in the actinide monopnictides and monochalcogenides , which all crystallize in the nacl structure at ambient conditions , the actinide - actinide separations are larger than in the elemental metals , and the tendency towards @xmath10-electron localization",
    "can already be observed from np compounds onwards .",
    "@xcite    here , we present the sic - lsd electronic structures calculations of the monopnictides and monochalcogenides of u , np , pu,@xcite am,@xcite and cm .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    the calculations reveal clear trends towards more and more actively bonding @xmath10-electrons for a ) lighter actinides , and b ) lighter ligands . for the lighter actinides , the @xmath10-orbitals",
    "are more extended leading to larger overlaps with their nearest neighbours and smaller self - interaction corrections , both of these effects are favoring band formation . for the lighter ligands , in particular n and o , both the volume is decreased and ionicity is larger , the first of these effects leading to larger direct actinide - actinide overlap , and the latter effect favoring charge transfer .",
    "the cm compounds are the most localized systems , all exhibiting cm in the trivalent @xmath38 configuration .",
    "the @xmath38 shell is so stable that variations of the ligand can not disrupt its stability and scenarios with either one more or less localized @xmath10-electron have distinctly higher energies .",

    "pentavalent states occur for the lighter ligands .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the densities of states of the actinide arsenides",

    "in the tetravalent case the additional delocalized @xmath10-electron appears as an extra @xmath10-band . in cm",
    ", this band appears far below the fermi level , while in am , pu and np this band lies just below the fermi level . the band formation energy due to this extra band is sufficiently large in npas to outweigh the localization energy , and the tetravalent configuration becomes the ground state .",
    "+      puo@xmath2 is the most favored compound for storage of pu from nuclear waste . in the stoichiometric compound pu",
    "is tetravalent with a localized @xmath53 shell , filled o @xmath61 bands and a large insulating gap .",

    "[ puo2-fig ] ) is that the nearest neighbour pu atoms of the interstitial o transform to the pentavalent configuration by delocalizing one @xmath10-electron , which is donated to the extra o to form hybridized states , occuring in the gap - region of the pure puo@xmath2 compound .",
    "similarly , an o vacancy in puo@xmath2 will lead to the formation of trivalent @xmath50 pu ions in the vicinity of the vacancy . in effect , the localized @xmath12 shell of pu acts as a reservoir for absorbing or releasing electrons to be accomodated by the chemical bonds of the o atoms .",
    "the lattice constant of the puo@xmath62 system almost does not vary with @xmath64 due to two opposing effects ( fig .",
    "[ puo2-fig ] ) .",
    "the added o per se leads to lattice expansion , but the additional bonding due to the formation of pentavalent pu causes the lattice to contract .",
    "the sequence of uranium intermetallics , ux@xmath3 , x = rh , pd , pt and au are interesting due to their variation in metallic properties .",
    "this is well reproduced in the sic - lsd approach.@xcite the u configuration changes from @xmath65 in urh@xmath3 to @xmath66 in upt@xmath3 and to @xmath52 in upd@xmath3 and uau@xmath3 .",
    "this is due to hybridization of the ligand @xmath21-band , which in urh@xmath3 is not completely occupied , with the u @xmath10-electrons to form hybridized bands rather than non - bonding localized states . in upd@xmath3 and",
    "uau@xmath3 the @xmath21-band is full , and the u @xmath10-electrons can not contribute further to the bonding , while upt@xmath3 is the borderline case , where the @xmath21-band is full but sufficiently close to the fermi level that the @xmath10-electrons can hybridize in , i.e. , the u @xmath10-manifold is situated in between the fully delocalized and fully localized scenarios , in good accord with the observation of heavy fermion properties of this compound .",
    "in summary , we have reviewed the electronic properties of a number of @xmath10-electron systems , as obtained within sic - lsd approach . we have demonstrated that this approach is well suited to describe trends regarding lattice parameters and valencies of these systems .",
    "it works especially well for systems with well localized @xmath10-shells .",
