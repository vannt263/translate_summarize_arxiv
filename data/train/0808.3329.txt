    "in this paper a quantitative understanding of kaon - few - nucleon quasi - bound states is attempted . in recent years , the existence of such states has been vividly discussed .",
    "it was initiated by the kek finding of peaks in the nucleon spectra of k@xmath3 absorption in @xmath4he , @xcite .",
    "additional evidence was given by the finuda measurement of the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath5 produced in k@xmath3absorption by light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the existence of such bound states have been expected as the kaon - nucleon and the kaon - nucleus interactions have been known to be strongly attractive , @xcite .",
    "this is now firmly confirmed on the basis of kaonic atom data @xcite .",
    "however , the kek and finuda experiments indicate unexpectedly strong bindings of the order of 100 , 150 mev in the lightest knn , knnn systems .",
    "these experiments require further confirmation .",
    "also , the interpretation of the observed peaks has been disputed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite while the initial interpretation is defended in ref . @xcite .",
    "calculations indicate that such states are expected , albeit these might be very broad and difficult to detect .",
    "the first calculations performed by akaishi and yamazaki in ref .",
    "@xcite were followed by several subsequent publications .",
    "these calculations exploited essentially the s - wave resonant attraction related to the @xmath0 state . with an optical model type of approach",
    "it was shown that the k - meson optical potential at the center of small nuclei may be as strong as 500 mev generating very strong binding of the meson and a strong contraction of the few - nucleon systems . however , to reproduce the kek data , these calculations involved some relaxation of the nn repulsion at short distances which would allow the existence of strongly bound and very dense systems .",
    "these calculations raise the important question on how to implement a realistic short range nn repulsion in the kaonic systems .",
    "another open question is related to the strength and range of kn interactions .",
    "any mathematical description of few body systems requires knowledge of nn and kn off - shell scattering amplitudes .",
    "those related to nn interactions are controlled fairly well in terms of modern nn potentials . for a bound k",
    "- meson the amplitudes needed involve the subthreshold energy region @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the kn separation energy and @xmath8 the recoil energy of the kn pair relative to the rest of the system",
    ". if the separation energy is as large as 100 mev , meson momenta become @xmath9 mev / c and @xmath10 may be as large as @xmath11 mev .",
    "the energies of interest for @xmath12 are then located well below the @xmath0 state .",
    "the amplitudes there are strongly attractive and so when used in a standard optical potential approach may support very strong bindings .",
    "one problem that arises at this stage is of a technical character .",
    "as these amplitudes are energy dependent , it is hard to account for that in the optical model approach .",
    "there exists another , more serious , problem which is common to all approaches",
    ". as the energies involved are far away from the physical region tested in kn scattering , the uncertainties in the kn scattering amplitudes are sizable .",
    "for instance , if the @xmath0 is a kn bound state , then the amplitude far below the resonance is given not only by the position of the singularity but to a greater extent by the born term , which indicates a strong dependence on the uncertain interaction range @xmath13 .",
    "an old multi - channel potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the available scattering data do not allow one to fix the precise value of @xmath13 .",
    "this unfortunate situation is still actual .",
    "the @xmath13 is expected to be close to the inverse vector meson mass . however , even though a change of 20@xmath14 in @xmath13 would not affect the scattering region , it results in a 30@xmath14 change of @xmath15 in the deep subthreshold region .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty in the binding energy then amounts to @xmath16 mev . as indicated by few body calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite this problem strongly affects the outcome .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath15 require further coherent experimental and theoretical studies of kn and k - few - n interactions .",
    "it becomes one of the most important purposes of the k meson physics .",
    "on the other hand , there is one consequence of eq.([1 ] ) which is model independent .",
    "if the binding and recoil are so large the @xmath15 amplitudes involve the energies below the thresholds of meson - hyperon decay channels . as a consequence",
    "the dominant decay modes are blocked and the lifetimes of nuclear k meson systems are determined only by multi - nucleon captures .",
    "this leads to the expectation that such states may live long enough to be detectable , @xcite .",
    "there exists several calculations of knn binding energies .",
    "these states are named k@xmath17pp although in reality they correspond to isospin @xmath18 and total isospin @xmath19 .",
    "the first prediction by akaishi and yamazaki lead to @xmath20 mev @xcite . with a similar , molecular type method , dote and weise @xcite",
    "obtain @xmath21 mev and indicate a strong dependence of this result on the short range nn repulsion . on the other hand , the recent three body calculations based on faddeev or ags methods yield larger bindings .",
    "thus schevchenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtain @xmath22 mev while ikeda and sato @xcite calculate @xmath23 mev . later in the text",
    "we show that the discrepancy of these two groups of results is due to : different @xmath0 properties , explicit description of the multiple scattering in decay channels and possibly to an incompatible treatment of the nn repulsion .",
    "there are two new elements introduced in this paper .",
    "first , the p - wave interactions due to @xmath1 have been indicated as a possible source of the strong binding . here ,",
    "these are introduced explicitly .",
    "second , the stress is put on the strong kn spacial correlations induced by the s and p wave resonances .",
    "leaving aside the interpretation of the peaks attributed to bound knn and knnn systems the essential theoretical questions are :    @xmath24 what is the binding mechanism ?",
    "@xmath25 are the technical questions under control ?",
    "@xmath26 can the widths be narrow ?",
    "this paper attempts an answer to these questions and the following results are obtained :    \\1 ) to account properly for the kn force range , short range kn correlations and the nn repulsion , a two step calculation is performed .",
    "first a wave function involving strongly correlated k - n subsystems is found in a fixed nucleon approximation .",
    "this step also allows one to find potentials due to the k meson which tend to contract the nucleons .",
    "next , these correlated wave functions and contracting potentials are used as the input in variational calculations for the k - few nucleon binding . in the knn case the binding energy and width",
    "are found by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "\\2 ) while the dominant mechanism of attraction is related to the @xmath0 state , it is found that another resonant state , the @xmath1 , contributes significantly to the structure of the bound states but much less to the binding in knn and k - few - n systems .",
    "in addition the @xmath1 generates new branches of nuclear states that could not be generated by the @xmath0 alone .",
    "\\3 ) the binding energy is determined to a large extent by the attraction and the repulsive core in nn interactions . with the argonne",
    "nn potential @xcite one obtains the lowest state of knn bound by about 40 - 80 mev and a knnn state bound by about 90 - 150 mev .",
    "moderate dependence on the kn interactions is found , provided these are constrained by the shape of @xmath0 and the value of the kn scattering length .",
    "however , the position of @xmath0 itself is not well known and this becomes the source of a large uncertainty .",
    "the effect of @xmath27 on the binding energy is limited , in the states bound via @xmath0 it adds some 5 - 10 mev contribution to the knn binding and 10 - 20 mev to knnn binding . in this sense",
    "the suggestions of ref .",
    "@xcite are not fully supported . however , the effect of @xmath27 on the space structure of deeply bound kaonic states is strong .",
    "the @xmath27 is formed in peripheral regions and it absorbs a large fraction of the total k meson binding . in consequence the radii of these systems are fairly large and the nucleon densities are comparable to those met in the @xmath4he nuclei .",
    "\\4 ) the problem of uncertainties related to the large recoil momenta entering eq.([1 ] ) is only partly removed .",
    "large kaon momenta are hidden inside the resonant structures . in principle",
    "these may be kept under control with the help of other experiments . in practice",
    "it is not the case .",
    "the other sector of large momenta , due to the strong binding , is partly screened by the short range nn repulsion .",
    "the main consequence is a strong dependence of the meson binding energies on the position of the @xmath0 resonance . in principle",
    "the shape of @xmath0 is tested by the invariant mass distribution in the decay @xmath28 channel . in practice",
    "it is not so as the relevant energy region is located close to the @xmath28 threshold . in this region",
    "the theoretical and experimental uncertainties are large .",
    "\\5 ) these states are very broad if the binding energies are less than 100 mev . for stronger bindings , which are possible under the current values of the kn parameters",
    "the main mesonic decay modes may be closed .",
    "the widths for non - mesonic modes are hard to calculate and extrapolations from the emulsion data are not very reliable .",
    "new experiments are needed .",
    "a simple physical picture emerges from this approach .",
    "the mesons are strongly correlated to slowly moving nucleons .",
    "the correlations are of the @xmath0 type at large densities , and of the @xmath27 type in the peripheries . each k",
    ", n pair has a good chance to stay also in the @xmath29 form .",
    "the structure is rather loose as sizable fractions of the binding energies are hidden in the short ranged correlations .",
    "this section presents an introduction to the method used in this work .",
    "several steps describe the increasing degree of precision and also the increasing level of technical complications :    @xmath30 at first the knn levels are found within the fixed nucleon approximation with a simple @xmath31 wave kn interaction .",
