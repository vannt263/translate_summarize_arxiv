    "nuclear rings in the central kiloparsecs of galaxies are usually observed as conglomerations of young massive stars in distinct compact groupings @xcite .",
    "the star forming rings are believed to form as a result of radial gas inflow towards the central region , which stagnates near dynamical resonances . in barred galaxies",
    "the inflow originates in the gravitational torques set up by the bar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some 20% of nuclear rings occur in non - barred galaxies @xcite and in those cases the inflow and resonances may well be related to the presence of weak ovals , past interactions or mergers , or even strong spiral arms .",
    "a resonant origin of all nuclear rings is most plausible .",
    "the radial location of a nuclear ring can be described by the position of the inner lindblad resonance(s ) ( ilrs ) @xcite , which is typically at @xmath11 kpc from the galaxy center although smaller and larger nuclear rings exist @xcite . in a non - axisymmetric potential , the nuclear ring forms near the ilr(s ) , where the inflowing molecular gas slows down , accumulates , and initiates star formation . for barred spiral galaxies",
    ", the ring can be formed inside the large scale galactic spiral structure in the vicinity of the inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) , which occur at those radii where the bar pattern speed @xmath2 equals ( @xmath3 ) , with @xmath4 the angular velocity and kappa the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "this approximation is not valid for strong bars where a non - linear analysis must be performed , but in any case serves as a useful indication of how the location of the ring is related to the underlying galaxy dynamics @xcite .",
    "only a few in - depth observational studies of the kinematics of nuclear rings at high angular resolution exist , but these have revealed some consistent kinematic characteristics of nuclear rings .",
    "@xcite showed that non - circular motions near the intersection of the ring and bar dust lanes correspond to radially inflowing molecular gas that is apparently feeding the ring in ngc  4314 .",
    "@xcite concluded for ngc  1530 the existence of weak velocity transitions at the ends of the bar which are inversely correlated with strong star formation in the same areas , including the nuclear ring location .",
    "@xcite further note an increase in the residual velocity along an axis perpendicular to the bar .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) and @xcite used co and @xmath5  emission in the central region of ngc  4321 and ngc  1530 , respectively , to reveal gas streaming inward towards the ring along the bar dust lanes .",
    "@xcite studied the fueling mechanisms of the ring in ngc  5248 to deduce that large star forming clusters in the ring have been triggered by a bar - driven spiral density wave .",
    "more recently , @xcite follow up on the ring in ngc  4321 to show relatively low @xmath6  gas dispersion within the ring , which can be an indicator of active star formation and cool gas inflow from which the massive stars inherited the low velocity dispersion .",
    "the existing kinematic studies provide insight into a small number of nuclear rings , but fail to reach more general conclusions applicable to the overall population .",
    "apart from the differing characteristics of the data used in these studies , this is due mostly to the intrinsically small angular size of nuclear rings , and the dusty environments in which they exist , both of which make rings non - trivial to observe with most common instruments yielding kinematic data . in this paper",
    "we endeavor to start rectifying this situation by presenting a more homogeneous data set on thirteen nuclear rings .",
    "the nuclear rings studied spectroscopically in the current paper were all part of the sample of @xcite ( hereafter known as m08 ) , who provided photometric insight into the strong star forming nature of nuclear rings . from their @xmath5",
    "observational study of 22 nuclear rings , they find that many of the rings exhibit a well - defined age distribution pattern .",
    "m08 conclude that this occurrence can be a result of the combination of bar - induced dynamics and gravitational instabilities which are occurring in the proximity of the rings .",
    "these results add credence to the idea that the mass inflow driven by the bar along the dust lanes to the ring contact points is a key requirement for the fueling of active ( i.e. , star forming ) nuclear rings ( and might also yield a possible signature in the form of non - circular motions ) .",
    "further evidence for this idea from detailed observations of a handful of galaxies has been presented by , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we now use kinematic information within and just outside the nuclear rings in 13 galaxies to investigate the possible relations between the optical morphology of the rings , the parameters derived from the rotation curve , and their resonant nature .",
    "we begin by presenting an overview of the observations and morphological properties of the @xmath5  sample in section  2 .",
    "we discuss the basic data reduction method , which includes the construction of the velocity field maps , in section  3 . in section  4 we discuss the kinematic parameters associated with the ring rotation curves , and present results pertaining to non - circular motions in and around the nuclear rings , including velocity residuals . our detailed analysis of the results is discussed in section  5 , with concluding remarks in section  6 .",
    "the galaxies studied here ( see table  [ tab : phot ] ) form a subset of the sample presented in the imaging survey of m08 ( which was based on @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath5  imaging ) .",
    "the data in m08 were obtained to characterize the morphology of the nuclear rings , and to analyze the age distribution of the individual stellar clusters forming each ring using the @xmath5  equivalent width .",
    "results from this photometrically based survey reveal that the rings contain very young ( 1 myr to 10 myrs ) hot massive stars , with some of the youngest clusters located in proximity to one or both of the intersection points of the bar dust lanes and the outer edge of the ring . the ring ellipticity and position angle approximately match that of the respective galactic disk , indicating that the rings are in the same plane as the disk and are circular ( m08 ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "we can not detect any  regions for nuclear rings with angular sizes less than 0@xmath155 in radius , however , we have previously unpublished high resolution fabry - perot @xmath5  data of ngc  1300 and ngc  6951 from the taurus instrument on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope , which we include in this sample . similarly , we have used the taurus data for ngc  4321 from knapen et al .",

    "we obtained two - dimensional @xmath5  velocity fields of the sample over two observing runs , in december 2003 and april 2004 , using the ` densepak `  fiber - optic array and bench spectrograph on the 3.5 m wiyn telescope .",
    "the ` densepak `  integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrograph @xcite consists of 91 fibers bonded into a 7  @xmath16  13 staggered rectangular grid that covers an area of @xmath17arcsec of sky with center - to - center fiber ( each fiber is 2.82arcsec in diameter ) spacings of 3.75arcsec .",
    "four of the fibers are allocated as sky fibers , and are spaced around the grid roughly 1@xmath18 from the center .",
    "the spectrograph was configured with the bench camera , which uses a tek 2048 ccd ( t2kc ) , with the 860 @xmath19mm@xmath20 grating , in the second order , centered at 6575 .",
    "we used a third order blocking filter ( gg495 ) .",

    "the spectral range included @xmath5  as well as the @xmath21 and @xmath22 lines .",
    "the effective instrumental resolution was different for the two runs , which is likely due to differences in the instrument setup .",
    "for the december 2003 run , the instrumental resolution ( fwhm ) averaged 0.97  ( 44@xmath23 ) around @xmath5 , with the resolution for the april 2004 run 1.31  ( 60@xmath23 ) .",
    "the array contains six dead fibers which decreases the number of active fibers to 85 . to avoid these areas , the projected image of each nuclear ring",
    "was placed in the upper half of the fiber array . because of this method , many of the rings were close to the edge of the field of view ( fov ) along the array minor axis , which limits our discussion of the environment exterior to the rings .",
    "we used two to four pointings , each of 1800s in duration , offset to fill the area of the dead fibers .",
    "this method also improved the sampling in some cases .",
    "for all exposures , the major axis of the array was aligned along a north - south direction .",
    "the fabry - perot observations for ngc  4321 are detailed in @xcite , with very similar procedures implemented for ngc  1300 and ngc  6951 .",
    "the pixel size in the reduced fabry - perot cubes is 0.27arcsec squared , and the separation between velocity channels is 15.7@xmath23 .",
    "each cube has 55 planes , thus covering a total velocity range of just over 1000@xmath23 .",
    "continuum subtraction was performed using the channels on either extreme end of this range .",
    "the raw ccd frames of the densepak data were zero- and bias - corrected , flat - fielded , cosmic - ray cleaned , and combined using the standard iraf noao packages ( zerocombine , ccdproc , flatcombine , cosmicrays , and imcombine , respectively ) .",
    "the combined images were wavelength - calibrated using the noao iraf data reduction package dohydra to extract the spectrum yielded by each fiber .",
    "a cuar comparison source was used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the reduced two - dimensional spectral image contains 89 rows ( comprising 85 data fibers and 4 sky fibers ) , where each row is one pixel in height and corresponds to a single fiber .",
    "we created gipsy scripts to identify and then subtract the continuum and sky from the spectrum following the method described in @xcite . due to pointing uncertainties inherent to the instrument , we established the measured pointing offsets ( i.e. , the shift from the center of the ` densepak `  fiber array to the ring center ) from the observations themselves .",
    "we followed the procedure outlined in @xcite , in which the continuum levels measured from the spectra are compared with levels derived from a reference image with known coordinates . for our sample",
    "we used the @xmath8-band images from m08 . by repeating this process for all positions near the nominal pointing",
    ", we created a grid of @xmath24 values , in which the minimum @xmath24 corresponds to the measured pointing offset .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty on the derived pointing is approximately 0.5arcsec .",
    "because the sky fibers contained no @xmath5  emission from the target galaxy , we used the average of the four reserved ` densepak `  sky fibers , each located 1arcmin from the center of the array .    to combine the pointings into a sparse velocity field , we first fitted gaussians to the continuum- and sky - subtracted @xmath5  emission line profiles , using a 3@xmath25 threshold to avoid spurious detections .",
    "the fitted velocities derived for each fiber were placed in a map at corresponding fiber positions .",
    "the observed radial velocities were corrected to heliocentric velocities . in the cases of multiple velocity measurements for the same pixel in the velocity field , we averaged the measured velocities . to aid in the visual representation of the sparse velocity field , we also constructed interpolated smoothed velocity field maps .",
    "we replaced each data point in the sparse velocity field with a gaussian beam of 5.5arcsec and weighted the overlapping sections between the points by the relative intensities of the overlapping gaussians .",
    "the resulting smoothed velocity fields are shown in figure  [ fig : vf ] ( left , panel  1 ) . because of interpolation effects these contiguous velocity fields may be uncertain , especially near the edges .",
    "any quantitative interpretation comes from the sparse velocity maps , which are not interpolated .",
    "the fabry - perot data were wavelength and phase calibrated , with sky and continuum emission subtraction performed , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the resulting reduced data cubes were used to produce @xmath5  velocity field maps using gipsy , and following the prescriptions given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting velocity fields are shown in figure  [ fig : vf - fp ] .",
    "rotation curves are powerful tools for revealing intrinsic kinematic characteristics of galaxies , including those of the nuclear rings they may host . in our sample , the range in radius spanned by the rotation curves is small when compared to the overall disk size , but this is a result of the small field of view of the instrument and of the sensitivity limit .    for each galaxy we derived the rotation curve ( figure  [ fig : rc ] ) by fitting tilted rings to the sparse velocity field through an iterative process ( see @xcite for procedural details ) .",
    "we chose the incremental radius for each concentric ring to be 1.5arcsec , which is approximately half of the width of a given fiber .",
    "we supplied the initial input values for the nuclear ring center , inclination , and position angle , as measured from @xmath8-band images ( m08 ) .",
    "we derived the initial center position by taking the point where the @xmath8-band emission is the highest near the galaxy center .",
    "the input value for @xmath26 in the fit to the velocity field is from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "one exception is ngc  5953 , whose systemic velocity was derived from the data due to a 26@xmath23 difference with the ned value . for the initial run , although we supplied input values , all parameters were left free .",
    "we first determined the center position and then fixed only that value for the second iteration to then determine the systemic velocity .",
    "once the center and systemic velocity were fixed we determined the inclination and position angle ( third and fourth iterations , respectively ) . with the four values then fixed , we fit the rotational velocity .",
    "we gave more weight to positions along the major axis , since those data points carry most of the information about rotational velocities .",
    "in most cases we used the inclination of the outer disk for the final fit .",
    "however , in the cases of low inclination ( below 25 ) , we adopted the photometric orientation parameters from m08 as initial inputs to the routine since the fitting routine produced inclinations with high uncertainties .",
    "even with such low inclinations the position angle was determined accurately with a tilted ring fit . because our data sets span a small range in radius , it was not feasible to make sophisticated fits to the velocity fields .",
    "the uncertainties on the velocities derived from the line fits range from 0.5@xmath23 to 5@xmath23 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is due to the unknown location of the halpha emission within the area seen by each fiber .",
    "the amplitude of this uncertainty depends on the velocity gradient across the face of the fiber .",
    "we estimated this gradient for all fibers using the derived rotation curves , and found that a value of 8@xmath23 is representative of a 1@xmath25 uncertainty .",
    "rotation curves for the fabry - perot data were similarly generated , but here , the smaller pixel size and full spatial sampling allowed us to fit the rotation curves with radial steps of 0.5arcsec from the center outward .",

    "these maps , however , are useful because they give a better sense of patterns in the image .",
    "we find that all of the nuclear rings in our sample have low residual velocities ( both approaching and receding ) near the central ridge of the ring ( ranging from @xmath15@xmath23 to @xmath120@xmath23 ) .",
    "the nuclear rings in ngc  473 and ngc  7742 are not resolved enough to comment on here , as the associated residuals do not overcome the uncertainties associated with the measured velocity , wavelength calibration , and position of the @xmath5  peak within a given fiber beam .",
    "patches of approaching and receding residual velocity peaks of @xmath110@xmath23 occur in the nuclear rings of ngc  1343 , ngc  4314 , and ngc  5953 , and reach to near 20@xmath23 in the rings of ngc  1530 and ngc  5248 . since these values are close to the combined measurement uncertainty , they can provide no firm evidence for the existence and origins of non - circular motions ( in ngc  4321 the situation is better , as discussed in detail by knapen et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a comparison of the kinematic and photometric centers of the sample reveals no strong asymmetries .",
    "the degree to which the centers differ is proportional to the lopsidedness of the potential , and thus a good indicator of the amount of non - circular motion @xcite .",
    "after computing the difference between the kinematic and photometric center positions ( see table  [ tab : kin ] ) , we see that the center positions agree to within the uncertainties of the photometric center measurements .",

    "uncertainties in the various size measurements involved were also added in quadrature to yield typical uncertainties in the relative ring size and width of @xmath33 .",

    "we define compactness as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the rotational velocity difference between the radial location of the turnover radius , @xmath38 , and the origin ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the turnover radius is defined as the point in the rotation curve halfway between the initial steeply rising component and the flat(ter ) segment .",
    "for the few galaxies with very steeply rising rotation curves , such as ngc  2903 and ngc  3351 , the turnover radius can not be measured accurately , and hence the compactness is uncertain . in these cases ,",
    "the compactness should be considered a lower limit .",
    "table  [ tab : rc - parms ] lists the compactness and turnover locations .",
    "as expected , the compactness decreases with increasing turnover radius ( not shown graphically , but the values are in the table . in linear theory , which is not strictly applicable here but yields useful approximations , the turnover radius in the rotation curve sets the location of the ilrs , and",
    "they in turn determine where inflowing gas piles up , which ultimately forms the nuclear ring @xcite .",
    "indeed , the location of the nuclear rings correlates well with the turnover radius ( see figure  [ fig : rc ] and the left panel of figure  [ fig : turnover ] ) , which we can identify with the phenomenon identified above .    in panel  1 of fig .",
    "[ fig : rc - plots ] we compare the relative ring size , that is the nuclear ring semi - major axis divided by the semi - major axis of the host galaxy , to the compactness parameter as derived from the rotation curve .",

    "the relative ring size is compared to the non - axisymmetric galactic torque , @xmath34 , in panel four of fig .",
    "[ fig : rc - plots ] .",
    "this torque parameter , originally defined by @xcite to characterize bar strength , quantifies the overall influence of galactic non - axisymmetries .",
    "specifically , @xmath34 is the maximum tangential force at a given radius divided by the radial force . for all galaxies except two",
    ", we adopt the @xmath34 values from comern et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , as noted in table  [ tab : rc - parms ] , since they applied a consistent computation method for all of the nuclear rings seen in our sample .",
    "we confirm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rc - plots ] ) that the highest torque values occur in those galaxies with the smaller rings relative to the size of their host disk ( knapen 2005 ; comern et al .",
    "as the torque weakens below @xmath34 = 0.4 any size ring can form , but higher torque values ( `` stronger bars '' ) progressively limit the nuclear ring size .",
    "the compactness and the non - axisymmetric torque @xmath34 do not correlate ( panel 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig : rc - plots ] ) .",
    "also , the turnover and @xmath34 do not correlate ( not shown graphically ) .",
    "this may be because the non - axisymmetric torque is a parameter driven more by the azimuthal than the radial distribution of mass , whereas the opposite is the case for the turnover radius and compactness .",
    "the width of a nuclear ring is an important parameter because it very much defines how well a ring is visible in an h@xmath39 image , and how it is seen in contrast with the background emission from the host galaxy .",
    "using the ring parameters we have now determined , it is interesting to see whether the ring width is driven by the physical properties of the host galaxy .",
    "so , as a first step , we define the ring width as the difference between the inner and outer ring boundaries , as defined from the emission in @xmath5 , and then plot the width of the nuclear ring against the relative ring size ( right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : turnover ] ) .",
    "we see a trend that larger nuclear rings are wider , which might not have been expected _ a priori_.    we then compare the compactness to the nuclear ring radial width ( panel  2 of fig .  [ fig : rc - plots ] ) .",
    "there is some evidence for a trend of compactness with ring width , where a nuclear ring is wider as the compactness decreases .",
    "we can thus conclude that increased compactness leads to both smaller and narrower nuclear rings , which is in accord with the expectations from linear theory and the location of a pair of ilrs near the turnover radius of a rotation curve .",
    "this clear link between the kinematics of the galaxy and the morphological parameters of the nuclear rings is thus further direct evidence for a resonant origin of the nuclear rings , deeply linked to the underlying structure of the host galaxy .",
    "this evidence based on kinematics supplements earlier evidence based almost exclusively on morphology , as reviewed and extended by comern et al .",
    "we combined densepak integral field unit and taurus fabry - perot observations for a sample of 13 galaxies that contain nuclear rings .",
    "based on this sample , we note the following new findings :    * nuclear rings are intrinsically circular and unaffected by the local non - axisymmetric environment that can exist from active star formation within the rings ; they are influenced by global phenomenon that can affect the potential , such as a bar .",
    "* the compactness , derived from the rotation curves , decreases as the ring width increases .",
    "* the compactness also decreases as the relative ring size increases * as the relative nuclear ring size increases so does the width of the ring * strong bars with a @xmath29 of 0.4 or greater can only be accompanied by small and thin nuclear rings . for smaller torques ,",
    "the ring size can vary .      *",
    "true to resonance theory , the location of the nuclear rings correlates well with the turnover radius . *",
    "the highest torque values occur in those galaxies with the smaller rings relative to the size of their host disk .",
    "* for ngc  4314 residual velocities sharply decrease and plateau within the nuclear rings .",
    "ordered velocity patterns increase near the outer edge of the ring ( both approaching and receding ) close to both sides of the bar minor axis . *",
    "the residual velocities for ngc  5248 near the western side of the bar minor axis reach 40@xmath23 , with a weaker - defined , although evident , transition zone as radii approach the outer ring boundary . * in the case of ngc  1530 large velocity excesses exist to the west of the nuclear ring , near its exterior edge and then sharply decrease over a small transition zone near the outer boundary of the nuclear ring .",
