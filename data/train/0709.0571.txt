    "the latter modes can be absent only for the insulating boundary condition @xmath299 .",
    "the calculations are straightforward and the final expressions are much simplified under the adiabatic condition ( 2.34 ) or for low frequencies @xmath460 .",

    "the resultant characteristic time @xmath145 grows as @xmath462 , while the life time of the critical fluctuations @xmath173 grows as @xmath463 .",

    "using @xmath131 or @xmath464 we have examined the acoustic eigenmodes , the response of the fluid to applied oscillation of the boundary temperature , the boundary heat flux , and the boundary position .",
    "to these thermal and mechanical perturbations , resonance is induced when the frequency of the perturbation is close to one of the eigenfrequencies , while nearly uniform adiabatic changes are caused in the interior at much lower frequencies owing to the piston effect .",
    "+ ( iii ) we have also examned the response to a stepwise change of the boundary temperature and the boundary position .",
    "the relaxation time is given by the modified piston time @xmath150 in eq.(3.16 ) first introduced by ferrell and hao @xcite .",
    "it is equal to the original piston time @xmath5 in eq.(1.1 ) for the isothermal boundary @xmath165 and to @xmath465 for the insulating boundary @xmath271 .",
    "+ ( iv ) as the critical point is approached , the role of the thermal diffusion layers is eventually diminished both by decreasing of the effusivity ratio @xmath120 and by growing of the bulk viscosity @xmath22 , while the bulk sound attenuation becomes increasing stronger . the bulk viscosity effect in the thermal diffusion layer",
    "is thus masked by its enhanced effect in the bulk .",
    "+ ( v ) for co@xmath9 in a cu cell , the boundary becomes thermally insulating for @xmath466 .",
    "this suppresses the bulk viscosity effect in the thermal diffusion layers as long as eq.(3.17 ) holds or for @xmath467 . in this case , the viscous regime predicted by carl@xmath13s and dadzie emerges for @xmath468 @xcite . to increase this crossover reduced temperature ,",
    "the cell length @xmath3 needs to be shorter . for the wall materials in ref.@xcite ,",
    "this crossover occurs much closer to the critical point @xcite .",
    "+ ( vi ) we have also examined sound emission and reflection at the boundary , which are elementary hydrodynamic processes but seem to have not been well examined @xcite . for emission , the formulas ( 3.34 ) and ( 3.38 ) are valid for a mechanical piston and a thermal heat input on time scales longer than @xmath173 . for reflection , eq.(3.43 ) with eq.(3.44 ) holds on time scales longer than @xmath173 .",
    "the formula ( 3.49 ) is the classical one valid on time scales much longer than @xmath145 , where the distortion of the outgoing pulse increases on approaching the critical point . for pulses shorter than @xmath145 , the distortion of the outgoing pulse",
    "is decreased as can be seen in fig .",
    "+ in this paper , we have treated near - critical fluids in one phase states .",
    "however , more challenging are hydrodynamic effects in in two phase states , where latent heat transport , wetting dynamics , and marangoni convection come into play in addition to the piston effect @xcite .",
