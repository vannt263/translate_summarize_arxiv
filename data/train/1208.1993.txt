    "the value of the w mass and the preferred decay of the sm higgs boson into weak bosons are responsible for all the features seen in the distribution of branching ratios over this distinctive transition mass region .",

    "@xmath99 is expected due to the reasons described above , the fact that this distribution peaks _ exactly _ at the measured @xmath1 value is completely unexpected .",
    "one can speculate about the possibility that there is an ( unknown ) underlying dynamical reason that makes the product of sm higgs boson branching fractions to peak right at @xmath1 .",

    "any underlying principle that would force the higgs mass to be that which maximizes its decay probabilities to all the sm particles simultaneously would , first , imply that the higgs self - coupling @xmath3 is not a free parameter of the theory but it is related to the individual higgs couplings to the rest of fields .",
    "should such a mechanism exist , it would require an explanation beyond the sm which could in addition impose constraints to viable extensions of the theory .",

    "in addition , if such a principle existed one could also use it to place limits or constraints on new possible particles through unobserved higgs decay channels ( such as e.g. to pairs of dark matter particles ) and `` invisible '' decays into e.g. neutrinos and/or axions  @xcite .",
    "adding , for example , three new higgs boson decays into ( dirac ) neutrino - antineutrino pairs with yukawa couplings as for the other sm fermions , i.e. using @xmath100mev ) instead of @xmath101 in eq .",

    "it would be interesting to test the shape of the corresponding @xmath55@xmath56 distribution taking into account alternative neutrino mass realizations e.g. in the context of seesaw mechanisms .",
    "similarly , we defer for a coming study to check whether the @xmath1-peak in the product of decay fractions present in the sm appears also for the ( unconstrained ) masses of other higgs particles in the context of supersymmetric , or more generally two - higgs - doublet , extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the fourteen branching ratios of the standard model higgs boson into the known fermion and boson pairs have been computed as a function of the higgs boson mass in the range @xmath0  01  tev with the hdecay  and prophecy4f  programs . the product of the branching ratios in all decay channels available below the top - antitop threshold is observed to be a gaussian distribution of the higgs boson mass with a maximum centered at @xmath74  124.9  @xmath650.2  gev , i.e. exactly in the region of masses where a new boson resonance has been discovered at the lhc . we have argued that such an intriguing observation is in principle not unexpected as the fermionic ) than @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , the shape of the @xmath59 branching ratio also directly depends on the value of @xmath34 in the region where one or both top - quarks are off - shell .",
