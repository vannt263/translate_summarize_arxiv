    "in @xmath14 seyferts 1 and quasars there is an interesting phenomenon , the ionized absorber or warm absorber ( wa ) ( reynolds 1997 ; crenshaw et al . 2003a ; piconcelli et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in the x - ray band for the first time in the spectrum of the quasar mr2251 - 178 by halpern ( 1984 ) with the einstein observatory .",
    "more recently , high resolution observations by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  have revealed the presence of blueshifted absorption lines ( v@xmath15 to @xmath16 km s@xmath4 with respect to the agn host rest frame ; collinge et al .",
    "2001 ; kaspi et al . 2002 ) , produced by warm ionized gas ( t@xmath17 k ; krongold et al .",
    "these reveal the nature of the wa as an outflowing wind .",
    "the absorbing gas usually shows several components with different states of ionization , as it is demonstrated , for instance , by the different transitions of oxygen ( vii ovii ,  viii oviii ) , or the different transitions of iron ( vii - xii fevii - xii  and xvii - xxii fexvii - xxii ) .",
    "transitions by iv civ , v nv ,  and vi ovi   are observed in both the x - ray and uv spectra of these sources ( with similar outflow velocities , suggesting a connection between the narrow absorption line systems in the uv and the wa ( crenshaw et al .",

    "the possibility that the absorbing components with different ionization states are in pressure equilibrium with each other , has been suggested by the analysis of several seyfert 1 galaxies : ncg  3783 ( krongold et al .",

    "these results strongly suggests that the absorbers consist of a discrete multi - phase medium .",
    "is important point out that these studies were carried out by fitting observations using photoionization models .",
    "a detailed model for the wa consisting of a thermal multiphase wind , with a density - size spectrum has been presented by chelouche & netzer ( 2005 ) ; chelouche ( 2008 ) .",
    "another representation of the absorber ( which includes calculations of line radiative transfer , but does not fit directly the data ) may be a constant pressure medium with a radially stratified density distribution ( raska et al .",

    "this galaxy has been studied many times in the optical , uv , and x - ray bands . the optical variability of the source allows detailed reverberation mapping studies of the broad emission line region ( belr ; e.g. peterson , 1993 ) , yielding a central black hole mass of @xmath21 m@xmath22 ( peterson 2004 ) .",

    "the long - term x - ray and optical continuum light curves are highly variable and are correlated ( uttley et al .",
    "it has been suggested that these variations are due to thermal instabilities in the inner disk ( treves et al .",
    "the short - term x - ray variability may be more concentrated toward the center of the accretion flow ( uttley et al . ) .",

    "ngc 5548 is the first seyfert galaxy for which a possible connection between the x - ray and uv absorbers was suggested ( mathur et al .",
    "1995 ) given the ionization state of the medium ( though a connection has already been suggested for the quasar 3c 351 by mathur et al .",
    "however , the exact nature of this connection in ngc 5548 has been controversial .",
    "brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) disputed this conclusion by the discrepancies in the vi ovi  ionic column densities inferred in the two bands .",
    "arav et al .",
    "( 2003 ) then found consistency between these columns , once the effects of velocity - dependent covering fraction in the uv band are considered .",
    "however using simultaneous _ chandra_-letgs and hst - stis observations , crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2003)b report that the ratio @xmath33 , in the uv component 1 , is 2.5 , which suggests a gas with low ionization state , implying low vii ovii  and viii oviii  column densities .",
    "crenshaw et al . , then suggested no relation between the uv and x - ray absorbers . using _",
    "_   high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) and letgs data , steenbrugge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed again a link between that x - ray and uv absorbers , given the similar kinematics seen in the absorption lines in the two bands . a new study based on 2002 uv spectra suggested that at least a part of uv component 3 should produce absorption in x - rays range ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2009 ) . while it is clear that some connection exists , the exact relation between the uv and x - ray absorbers remains uncertain .",
    "ngc 5548 is perhaps an exception to the idea that the wa is a multi - phase medium possibly in pressure balance (  [ intro ] ) .",
    "a continuous radial range of ionization states was suggested for the structure of the wa in this source ( steenbrugge et al .",
    "it should be noted that ngc 5548 has an unusually low galactic column density ( 1.6@xmath34 @xmath35 , murphy et al .",
    "1996 ) , so the x - ray spectrum remains less absorbed at soft x - ray wavelengths than in most agns .",
    "this broader wavelength range exposes extra atomic transitions that can provide additional constraints on wa conditions ( for instance ngc 3783 , has a very well studied absorber , but has a substantially higher galactic column density than ngc 5548 , 9.5@xmath34 @xmath35 , murphy et al .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to test the multi - phase scenario for the absorber in this object .    for these reasons , an analysis of all the seven _",

    "datasets seems in order .",
    "we re - analyzed archival _",
    "chandra _",
    "letgs and hetgs high resolution spectra of ngc 5548 .",
    "despite previous results that suggest that only a continuous radial flow could model the absorber ( steenbrugge et al .",
    "2005 ) , we show that its physical structure is also consistent with a multi - phase medium .",
    "we contrast our results with previous studies of this source . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    "we describe our data modeling . in   4 we discuss our results , and in   5 their implications .",
    "ngc 5548 was observed seven times with the _ chandra _   x - ray observatory ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ) between 1999 and 2005 ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "two observations were carried out with the hetgs ( canizares et al . 2000 ) with the light dispersed on to the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al .",
    "the remaining five observations were obtained with the letgs ( brinkman et al .",
    "2000 ) and the high resolution camara ( hrc ; murray et al .",
    "we retrieved the primary and secondary data products of the observations from the _ chandra _  data archive .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations software ( ciao v.3.4 ; fruscione et al .",
    "we followed the data analysis threads provided by the _ chandra _  x - ray center .",
    "negative and positive first order spectra were extracted and response matrices created for each observation . in this paper , we explore the time - averaged properties of the spectra , focusing on the best possible determination of the different ionization and velocity components of the well - known ionized absorber in this agn .",
    "thus , we co - added the spectra obtained with each instrument to get the maximum signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "this gave a total net exposure time of 236 ks for the meg and heg spectra , and 564 ks for the leg spectrum .",
    "the source shows flux differences among observations .",
    "the change in flux between the 2 hetgs observations is @xmath361.7 .",
    "the change in flux among the letgs data is a factor of 6 during the six years of observations ( see fig.[fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the change in flux in short time scales between consecutive ( letgs ) observations is @xmath361.2 - 1.6 ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) , ( for observations separated by 3 days ) .",
    "a time - evolving analysis is postponed to a forthcoming paper ( andrade - velazquez et al . in preparation ) .",
    "however , we discuss the possible effects that these variations in our analysis in section [ effects ] .    we have analyzed the data in the range between ( 1.57 to 10.81 )     ( [ 1.15 to 7.90 ] kev ) for the heg , ( 2.46 to 24.58 )     ( [ 0.50 to 5.04 ] kev ) for meg , and ( 8.85 to 49.15 )     ( [ 0.25 to 1.40 ] kev ) for leg .",
    "all the data were binned by a factor of 2 , corresponding to 0.005   , 0.01    , and 0.025     per bin for the heg , meg and leg , respectively .",
    "we have used the ciao software sherpa ( freeman et al . 2001 ) to perform spectral fits to the data . in all the models described below",
    ", the attenuation due to the galactic absorption was accounted for with a neutral absorber ( see   1 ) .",
    "we first focus on the hetgs ( heg and meg ) data .",
    "then , we compare the final hetgs model with the letgs data , and find a good fit at both short and long wavelengths ( see below ) .        initially , we fit the data with a power law , following previous analysis ( reynolds et al .",
    "1997 : advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics -_asca _ ; nicastro et al .",
    "2000 _ bepposax _ ) and a black - body component ( kaastra @xmath37 barr 1989 , steenbrugge et al .",
    "2005),see table [ tab : models ] , model a. we further added four gaussians to model the evident emission lines ( see table [ tab : el ] ) .",
    "three emission lines are resolved , with fwhm between @xmath38500 - 700 km s@xmath4 ( meg has an fwhm resolution of @xmath39 155  km s@xmath4 at 19    ) .",
    "these lines are in the soft band ( consistent with ix neix@xmath4013.69 , vii ovii@xmath40 22.10 , and vi nvi@xmath40 23.27 ) .",
    "the short wavelength ( @xmath41 ) region of the spectra shows the presence of the fourth emission line .",
    "this corresponds to the commonly found low - ionization ( @xmath42 xvii fexvii ) fe k@xmath29 line ( 6.4 kev , nandra et al .",
    "2007 ) , and is located at 1.937    ( without any shift from the rest frame of the host galaxy ) .",
    "yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report an ew of 133 ev and a width of 4515@xmath43 and suggest a possible origin in the outer broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "we report a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 2644@xmath442469  km s@xmath4 consistent with the value reported by yaqoob et al .",
    "we find a slightly lower ew than this authors , ew@xmath45 92.2@xmath46 ev , however , a detailed analysis of this line is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "though model a was statistically acceptable ( @xmath47/d.o.f.= 3813/4112 ) , strong negative residuals between ( 5 - 24.5 )   are present , consistent with absorption features by ionized atoms ( xvii - xxii fexvii - xxii , vii - viii ovii - viii , ix - x neix - x , xiii - xiv sixiii - xiv , vi - vii nvi - vii ,  and xi - xii mgxi - xii ) due to the well - known wa in this source ( see fig.[fig : moda ] ) .",
    "to model the features produced by the ionized absorber , we used the code phase ( krongold et al .",
    "the code has 4 free parameters per absorbing component , namely 1 ) the ionization parameter at the illuminated face of the absorber @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the rate of h ionizing photons , @xmath50 is the distance to the source , @xmath51 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath52 is the speed of light ; 2 ) the hydrogen equivalent column density @xmath53 , 3 ) the outflow velocity of the absorbing material v@xmath54 and 4 ) the micro - turbulent velocity v@xmath55 of the material .",
    "usually , the micro - turbulent velocity is not left free to vary , because the different transitions due to ionized gas are heavily blended , or because the different velocity components are also blended and can not be resolved ( e.g. krongold et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 for ngc 3783 ) . in the case of ngc 5548 , with the hetgs data resolution , it is possible to distinguish two velocity components ( see below ) .",
    "so , despite the fact that the individual absorption lines can not be resolved , we have left the micro - turbulent velocity free to vary ( at least for the strongest absorbing components , see below ) . phase has the advantage of producing a self - consistent model for each absorbing component , because the code starts without any prior constraint on the column density or population fraction of any ion .",
    "we have assumed solar elemental abundances ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) .",
    "so , given the intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed , the approximation of this input parameter is explained in the next subsection ) of the source , the column density , and the ionization parameter of the absorbing media , the ionization balance is fixed .    in all the models described below",
    ", we have assumed that the continuum source ( including the soft excess ) is fully covered by the ionized absorbing gas while the emission lines are produced outside the region where the absorbing material is located .",
    "the x - ray to radio sed of ngc 5548 , used to calculate the ionization balance of the gas , was defined in the following way : between the radio and the near uv ranges , we used ( non simultaneous ) data from ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database , references are attached in appendix  [ app ] ) . in the range between 100 @xmath56 m and 912  , we performing a linear fit to the over 100 references of flux measurements found in ned . for the region between ( 0.25 - 7.90 ) kev ( [ 1.57 - 49.15 ]",
    " ) , we used the power law ( @xmath0 ) as well as the black - body contribution , as inferred from the fits to the continuum presented in table [ tab : contmh ] . for energies",
    "@xmath57 kev , we extrapolated the derived @xmath0 in our fits up to 130 kev , where a cut - off is observed ( nicastro et al .",
    "given that the uv sed shape has only a second order effect on the ionization balance of the x - ray species , as these charge states have ionization potentials larger than 0.1 kev ( see netzer 1996 , steenbrugge et al .",
    "2003 ) , we have connected the unobservable region of the sed between 912   and 0.25 kev with a simple power law ( haro - corzo et al .",
    "the radio region ( at 21 cm ) was connected with the infrared ( 100 @xmath56 m ) also with a simple power law .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] shows the final sed used in this work .",
    "an important caveat of averaging the different datasets is that the the physical properties of the absorbers might have changed among observations , either because of intrinsec changes or because of changes induced by the variations in the flux level .",
    "we note , that kaastra et al .",
    "2002 and steenbrugge et al .",
    "2005 report similar values for the hydrogen equivalent column density ( within the uncertainties ) for the 1999 and 2002 observations ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "then , we do not expect a significative change in the equivalent hydrogen column density among the seven observations .",
    "the same is true for the outflow velocity of the absorbing gas .",
    "however , the flux level changes between the observations used in this work . assuming the gas is in photoionization equilibrium",
    ", this would drive changes by the same factors observed in the ionization parameter ( u ) of the gas ( producing changes in the gas opacity ; nicastro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there is a flux variation by a factor of 1.7 between the hetg observations , thus , the expected variation between these two observations will be delta ( logu ) = 0.23 . for the letg observations , there is a large change in flux ( by a factor of 6 during 6 years ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) between the first and last two observations . in photoionization equilibrium",
    "this would produce a change delta(logu ) = 0.77 in the ionization parameter .",
    "thus , our determination of this parameter in the co - added data will represent a weighted average over the different observations .",
    "we note that for the letg , the 1999 and 2002 observations have the higher s / n and similar fluxes ( different by a factor @xmath58 , and also similar to the hetg observations ) .",
    "then , the best fit value of the absorbing gas ionization parameter on the letg co - added spectrum will be highly dominated by these observations ( the inclusion of the 2005 fainter observations contribute to increase the s / n by @xmath59 ) .",
    "we made a new model , b , by including a single ionized absorbing component to model a. table [ tab : comp ] shows the best fit parameters values for this model .",
    "the outflow velocity is @xmath45   -740@xmath60 km s@xmath4 and could correspond to the uv component 2 , which has a value @xmath45   -667 km s@xmath4 .",
    "given the ionization parameter ( logu@xmath61 ) and column density ( logn@xmath62 ) of this component ( see table [ tab : models ] ) , this model fits the absorption lines produced by ions such as xvii - xxii fexvii - xxii , ix - x neix - x , xiii sixiii , xi - xii mgxi - xii ,  and viii oviii  ( see fig . [",
    "fig : modb ] ) .",
    "the fit gives a significant improvement over model a ( @xmath63 for 4108 d.o.f . ;",
    "@xmath64 ) . an f - test gives a higher than @xmath65 confidence level for the presence of the absorber ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "the absorbing component can reproduce @xmath45 20 absorption features ( including blends ) in the wavelength region ( 5 - 20 )   .",
    "however , significant residuals remain at 6.18   , which are probably due to a xiv sixiv  transition ( @xmath406.182 ) , and at 10.62    and 11.01   , probably corresponding to transitions by xxiv fexxiv(@xmath4010.619 ) and xxiii fexxiii(@xmath4011.019 ) , see figure [ fig : modbc ] ; indicating the possible presence of another absorbing component of gas with higher ionization .",
    "strong residuals found close to 16.5   , could correspond to inner transitions of ix feix , further suggesting the possible presence of another absorber with lower ionization state .",
    "in addition , a detailed inspection of the spectrum near the absorption lines fit by this model ( xi mgxi , ix neix , xvii fexvii ,  and xiv sixiv ) reveals a complex structure in the line profile , with additional absorption with an outflow velocity of @xmath45 -1040 km s@xmath4 ( see fig .",

    "the ionization parameters ( logu@xmath68 and logu@xmath69 ) are different by almost a factor of 3 ( see table [ tab : comp ] ) .    the component with lower ionization ( with logu@xmath69 slightly lower than logu@xmath70 ) models the transitions already fitted in model b : xiii - xiv sixiii - xiv , ix - x neix - x , xi - xii mgxi - xii , xvii - xxii fexvii - xxii ,  and viii oviii   ( see fig .",

    "the final model ( f ) for the ionized absorber in the meg and heg spectra of ngc 5548 can be further tested by extrapolating to the letgs data ( the letgs resolution is a factor @xmath45 2.5 worse than the meg resolution at 19  ) . in doing this , we implicitly assume no significant opacity variations between the co - added hetgs and letgs spectra that may arise from flux variability ( nicastro et al . 1999 , krongold et al . 2005b , 2007 ) .",
    "given that the average flux level in these two spectra differs by only 30% ( steenbrugge et al .",
    "2005 ) , this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "to fit the leg spectrum , we used model f , with the 4 absorbing components parameters fixed to the values obtained for the hetgs data ( hereafter model g ) .",
    "we also used the same continuum components ( a power law and a black - body ) , but we allow these parameters to vary freely in the fit , as the continuum level and spectral shape might be different ( in addition , the letgs is more sensitive to low energy photons and so these data allows for a better determination of the black - body temperature ) . in model g we also let free to vary the parameters for the emission lines detected in the hetgs spectra ( except for the fe k@xmath92 and xiii sixiii  lines that lie outside the spectral range of the letg ) .",
    "we further added three additional emission lines , ( located in wavelengths larger than 25  , the lower bound of the meg data ) , corresponding to v nv@xmath93 , vi nvi@xmath94 , and v cv@xmath95 ) .",
    "an acceptable fit is obtained to the letgs spectrum with this simple method ( @xmath96 ) , implying that the hetgs spectra alone can constrain in a reliable way the properties of the ionized absorber .",

    "this figure show that most absorption lines observed in the hetg data are well reproduced by the model in the letgs spectrum .",
    "it also shows that model g fits well more than 12 low ionization absorption lines in the region ( 26 - 49 )   .",
    "these lines correspond to transitions of ions such as v cv , v - vi nv - vi ,  and xii sxii . in the uta region",
    "there are discrepancies between data and model , but as for the hetgs data , they are produced likely due to the use of the abbreviated data to model this feature .",
    "we note that some low ionization lines show residuals consistent with an outflow velocity of -1040 km s@xmath4 as shown in the figure [ fig : lin5to ] .",
    "this may indicate the presence of a hv - lip ( see  [ d ] ) .",
    "however , attempting to model these residuals with an additional absorbing component does not improve the fit in a statistical way .",
    "the best fit model of the wa for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 requires two outflow velocity systems , each with two different ionization phases (  [ model ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lines2c ] shows that the profiles of the absorption lines ( produced by ions such as x nex , xviii fexviii , viii oviii ,  and xi mgxi ) are fit better with two narrow line profiles than with a single broad component .",
    "each of these two velocity components requires absorption by gas with very different ionization level .",
    "the lv component consists of gas with two different ionization states ( the lv - lip and the lv - hip ) .",
    "the hv component requires also two absorbers with different ionization ( the hv - ship and the hv - hip ) .",
    "these four absorbers , divided into two velocity systems , can reproduce all the spectral features observed in the spectra ( vii - xxiv fevii - xxiv , vi - viii ovi - viii , ix - x neix - x , ix - xii mgix - xii , xii - xiv sixii - xiv , v - vi cv - vi , ix - xii six - xii ,  and xi - xii arxi - xii ) .",
    "we note that the hv system might also have an additional , low ionization component ( hv - lip ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lin5to ] shows a double line profile for several low ionization level lines , suggesting a lip with higher outflow velocity ( -1041 km s@xmath4 ) . while the inclusion of this component is not statistically required by the data , its physical properties appear to be well constrained ( as can be observed in in figure [ fig:5aregp ] , where the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath97 confidence regions for the ionization parameter vs. the column density of this component are presented ) .",
    "further evidence for the presence of this component arises from the fact that uv system 1 can be associated with the hv absorber ( see  [ c ] ) , and the hv - ship and hv - hip have a very hgh ionization state to produce such absorption ( ( see tables [ tab : ionden ] and [ tab : ionden2 ] ) . we conclude that the data clearly shows a shift to higher ionization material at higher velocity in ngc 5548 wa , with the lip becoming weak and the ship dominating in the hv system . on the other hand , the lv system does not show the presence of the ship .",
    "the separation between components is a new and important feature in x - ray spectra of ionized absorbers , and could be achieved because of the large difference in velocity between the two systems ( @xmath98 km s@xmath4 ) , as well as the different dominant ionization levels between them ( see also steenbrugge et al .",

    "( 2003 ) finds five separate kinematic components in @xmath99 -stis and @xmath100 spectra .",
    "our analysis reports two kinematic components ( hv and lv systems ) .",
    "the hv system shows similar outflow velocity to the uv absorbing component 1 ( @xmath101 km s@xmath4 ) . according to crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2003)b , the gas producing absorbing component 1 should produce only a weak x - ray wa , which is consistent with the marginal detection of the hv - lip in the _ chandra _  data (   [ d ] ) .",
    "there is also a correspondence between the x - ray lv system and uv absorbing components 2 and 3 ( with outflow velocities @xmath102 and @xmath103 km s@xmath4 , respectively ) . crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2003)b and crenshaw et al .",
    "2009 suggest that at least component 3 ( and possibly component 2 ) should produce absorption in the x - ray range .",
    "this is consistent with the detection of the lv - lip .",
    "there is no x - ray detection of uv absorbing systems 4 and 5 ( with velocities @xmath104 and @xmath105 km s@xmath4 respectively ) , although we can not rule out a possible contribution from component 4 to the lv - lip , given the uncertainty in the outflow velocity of the x - ray systems . according to the analysis of the uv data by crenshaw et al . , system 5 has the lowest column density ( logn@xmath106=19.27 ) .",
    "krongold et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discuss how the difference in sensitivity of the current x - ray and uv detectors may affect the detection or non - detection of a given uv component in the x - rays .",

    "thus , given their ionization state and column density , systems 4 and 5 are consistent with not being detected in the x - rays , given the limited sensitivity of the x - ray observations .    while a kinematic connection between the components is evident , an important question is how the predicted / measured column densities for the different analyses compare between them .",
    "the ionic column densities predicted by our model are now listed in table [ tab : ionden ] and [ tab : ionden2 ] for the lv and hv systems , respectively . in these tables",
    ", we also list the column densities predicted ( or measured ) by crenshaw et al .",

    "the column densities for ions civ , nv y ovi between our predicted values and those measured by crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in the uv differ by factors of   16 , 4 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "we note that ovi ( where no diference is found ) is detected in the x - ray analysis as well .",
    "the differences between the uv and x - ray columns could be produced because of 3 different factors : 1 ) the blending of uv components 2 and 3 in the x - rays ( and maybe an additional contribution from uv component in our lv - lip model .",
    "2 ) the different seds used in the 2 analysis : the sed used by crenshaw et al . includes much more photons in the far ( unobservable ) uv , and 3 ) a detailed analysis on the dependence of the covering factor on velocity could not be performed in the analysis of the uv line profile .",
    "this could underestimate the columns as shown by arav et al .",
    "2003 . taking into account these effects",
    ", we consider that the predictions of our model for the columns measured in the uv are very reasonable , and conclude that the lv - lip component can produce the absorption features produced by uv component 3 ( and maybe 2 and 4 ) .",
    "however , we note that the values predicted by crenshaw et al . for the high ionization charge states differ from those measured in this analysis . the reason for this discrepancy , is that these ions are not observable in the uv , and only three ions ( civ , nv y ovi ) were used in the uv model .    with these considerations , and given the strong coincidence in kinematics between the uv and x - ray outflows ,",
    "we conclude that a common origin is not only possible , but quite likely .",
    "such connection was originally suggested by mathur et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for ngc 5548 , and has also been suggested for several other objects ( ngc 985- krongold et al .",

    "thus , these studies on the wa may represent a general feature of the structure for quasars , as proposed by elvis ( 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of two different absorbing components with different temperature but similar outflow velocity suggests that the absorber may be formed by a multi - phase medium ( e.g. elvis , 2000 ; krongold et al .",
    "given the two velocity systems in ngc 5548 , we could be seeing the presence of two different outflows ( with different outflow velocity ) , each being a multi - phase medium .",
    "this is further supported by the pressure equilibrium of the two absorption components in each velocity system . in figure",
    "[ fig : sc1 ] we show the thermal stability curve of the gas ( also known as the `` s - curve '' , krolik et al .",
    "1981 ) for the sed used in our analysis (  3.2.1 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the s - curve marks the points of thermal equilibrium in the t vs. u / t plane , where t is the photoionization equilibrium temperature of the gas , and u / t is inversely proportional to the gas pressure ( u / t @xmath111 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sc1]a , the position on the s - curve of the two lv absorbing components is shown .",
    "the lv - hip and the lv - lip have quite different temperatures but , within the errors , are consistent with a single value of the u / t , and so can be in pressure equilibrium .",
    "figure [ fig : sc1]b shows the hv - ship and hv - hip on the s - curve .",
    "again , the pressure equilibrium between the two components is allowed .",
    "note that , given the possible range of ionization parameters of the tentative hv - lip ( figure [ fig:5aregp ] ) , this component , if indeed present ( as suggested by our results and by those by crenshaw et al .",
    "2009 ) , could also be in pressure equilibrium with the higher ionization ones that form this system .",
    "thus , both the hv and the lv systems are formed by a two - phase medium ( or maybe three - phase for the hv system ) , with one component pressure confining the others ( see krongold et al .",

    "ngc 5548 is the first agn in which a two - phase wa medium is likely for two velocity systems .",
    "the presence of a multi - phase medium obviously requires that the different ionization components that form it lie at the same distance from the ionizing continuum .",

    "( 2007 ) measure the distance of the two absorbing components and found that they were indeed consistent with being co - located , giving further plausibility to multi - phase absorbing winds .    the ship of the hv system and the hip of both the lv and hv systems lie on unstable regions of the s - curve , implying a possible inconsistency with the multi - phase scenario .",
    "however , the shape of this curve depends on the exact shape of the sed of the source , which has major uncertainties , particularly in the extreme uv region ( haro - corzo et al .",

    "they used a self - consistent model that takes advantage of photoionization balance calculations to make a global fit to the data .",
    "they concluded that following this approach , and fitting fe separately , a good fit could be obtained , but constraining only two absorbing components .",
    "they further tested the presence of discrete components by adjusting equivalent h column densities and ionization parameters to the absorbing components of their model b , where ionic column densities were measured on an ion by ion fit . in this case",
    "they find that at least five different components with different ionization state were required .",
    "this approach led them to conclude that discrete components were not a good representation of the data .",
    "the most fundamental difference between the analysis carried out by steenbrugge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the present analysis is that their models b and c used only a single velocity outflow with a large turbulent broadening to fit the data",
    ". however , as they report in their paper , and as discussed here , the data are better fitted with two different velocity components , the hv system and the lv system .",
    "furthermore , as shown here ( and as also noted by steenbrugge et al . )",
    "the degree of ionization is different for the different velocity components , as the hv system becomes dominant for high ionization states .",
    "this led them to conclude that more and more ionization components were required to fit the data and thus a structure of discrete clumps of gas was unlikely .",
    "however , here we have shown that , when each velocity component is modelled independently , both can be well described by two ionization components , making the presence of discrete components plausible and likely .",
    "furthermore , the addition of extra components does not improve the fit .",
    "so , given the difference between number of free parameters from the different models , we can claim by occam s razor that our global approach is preferable .",

    "model b. the differences found between our analysis and that by steenbrugge et al .",
    "( that analysis shows sistematically larger columns than ours ) are likely produced because only one velocity component was used by steenbrugge et al . to model the line profile produced by the two velocity systems .",
    "a detailed fitting including the line profile of each velocity system produces more reliable column densities .",
    "steenbrugge et al .",
    "( 2005 ) further tested whether their five discrete components could be in pressure balance , and they concluded that they could not .",
    "in fact , their s - curve ( their fig.10 ) has no region where the slope is negative , making it impossible for the gas to be in pressure balance .",
    "we stress again that the shape of the s - curve depends strongly on the metallicity of the absorbing gas , and the shape of the sed used to produce it ( in this work we use the best multiwavelength data available extracted from ned ) . given this , and the new results by chakravorty et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we conclude that the possibility that the different phase are in pressure equilibrium can not be discarded . here",
    "we have shown that when the velocity systems are modelled independently , each one is consistent with pressure balance .",
    "we further note that chelouche ( 2008 ) also find that the wa in ngc 5548 can be described by a multiphase medium .",
    "the author models the ionized flow assuming a thermal wind . while his model is more physically driven than ours , it does not take into account the two different velocity systems revealed by the data .",
    "however , given the similar results , the idea of a multi - phase medium absorber is reinforced .",
    "the presence of two different velocity systems , each formed by gas with very different ionization state , can give a clue about the structure of the flow .",
    "in a continuous * radial * range of ionization structures , the wind must extend in our line of sight for parsecs ( or more ) , forming a large scale outflow along our line of sight .",
    "we find difficult to reconcile such a distribution of material with the two velocity systems found in ngc 5548 , even if inhomogeneities in the flow ( like those suggested by ramrez et al . 2005 ) are invoked .",
    "the presence of the two velocity components , then , suggests that we are not seeing the wind in a radial direction .    on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of the different kinematic components can be naturally explained if we are looking at an outflow in a transverse direction , which is consistent with the detection of transverse motion in the uv absorbers ( marthur et al .",
    "1995 , arav et al .",
    "2002 , crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case , an important component of the velocity ( and acceleration ) of the wind could take place in the direction perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "such a configuration for the wind is further supported by the finding that the different phases observed at each velocity form a single multi - phase outflow .    if the wind arises from the inner accretion disk ( konigl & kartje , 1994 , elvis et al .",
    "2000 , and krongold et al 2007 ) , and flows in a transverse direction with respect to our line of sight , the two velocity components could be simply explained as forming in different regions of the disk ( elvis , 2000 ) .",
    "the two velocity components in ngc 5548 are consistent with originate in the accretion disk , as discussed by krongold et al .",
    "furthermore , crenshaw et al . ( 2009 ) suggest that uv component 3 ( clearly associated to the lv - lip ) , should be accelarated by magnetocentrifugal forces , and thus should form at an accretion - disk scale ( bottorff et al .",
    "we note that an accretion - disk wind does not imply a small scale outflow .",
    "the wind could still extend for large scales , but our line of sight would cross it only at a given distance from the central ionizing source .",
    "we find that the wa of ngc 5548 can be modelled in a simple way with two different velocity systems ( v@xmath54 = -1110 km s@xmath4 and v@xmath114 km s@xmath4 ) each with two phases of gas in pressure equilibrium .",
    "this results strongly suggests that the structure of the absorber in ngc 5548 could consist of two different outflows ( with different outflow velocity ) , each formed by a multi - phase medium in pressure balance .",
    "the ionized absorber in ngc 5548 now fits a pattern established for the other well studied systems .",
    "there are no remaining cases in which a multi - phase medium is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "the presence of two velocity systems , each formed by a multi - phase medium suggests that we are looking at the flows in a transverse direction with respect to our line of sight ( as also suggested by the uv data ) .",
    "the velocity of the two x - ray absorbing systems is in agreement with components 1 , 2 , and 3 found in the uv band ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the x - ray data are further consistent with the non detection of uv components 4 and 5 , given the limited sensitivity and resolution of the current x - ray ( compared to those in the uv ) .",
    "there is also a reasonable agreement in the column densities of civ , nv , and ovi predicted by our x - ray analysis , and those measured in the uv .",
    "thus , our models elegantly solve the long - standing problem of apparent discrepancies between the uv and x - ray absorbers , and give further support to the idea that uv and x - ray absorbers are part of the same outflow .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of x - ray high quality grating spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548 using archival _ chandra_-hetgs and letgs observations for a total exposure time of 800 ks . the continuum emission ( between 0.2 - 8 kev ) is well represented by a power law ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 ) plus a black - body component ( kt = @xmath2 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the well known x - ray warm absorber in this source consists of two different outflow velocity systems . </S>",
    "<S> one absorbing system has a velocity of -@xmath3 km s@xmath4 and the other of -@xmath5 km s@xmath4 . recognizing the presence of these kinematically distinct components allows each system to be fitted independently , each with two absorption components with different ionization levels . </S>",
    "<S> the high velocity system consists of a component with temperature of @xmath6 k , @xmath7 and another component with temperature of @xmath8 k , @xmath9 . the high - velocity , high - ionization component produces absorption by charge states xxi - xxiv fexxi - xxiv , while the high - velocity , low - ionization component produces absorption by ix - x neix - x , xvii - xx fexvii - xx , vii - viii ovii - viii . </S>",
    "<S> the low - velocity system required also two absorbing components , one with temperature of @xmath10 k , @xmath11 , producing absorption by ix - x neix - x , xvii - xx fexvii - xx , vii - viii ovii - viii . the other with lower temperature ( @xmath12 k ) , and lower ionization ( @xmath13 ) ; producing absorption by vi - vii ovi - vii  and the vii - xii fevii - xii m - shell uta . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , a model consisting of a continuous radial range of ionization structures ( as suggested by a previous analysis ) is not required .    </S>",
    "<S> the two absorbing components in each velocity system are in pressure equilibrium with each other . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that each velocity system consists of a multi - phase medium . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that different outflow velocity systems have been modelled independently in the x - ray band for this source . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic components and column densities found from the x - rays are in agreement with the main kinematic components found in the uv absorber . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the idea that the uv and x - ray absorbing gas is part of the same phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 5548 can now be seen to fit in a pattern established for other warm absorbers : 2 or 3 discrete phases in pressure equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> there are no remaining cases of a well studied warm absorber in which a model consisting of a multi - phase medium is not viable . </S>"
