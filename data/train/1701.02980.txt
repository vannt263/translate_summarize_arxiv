    "[ sec : interface ] .",

    "[ fig:003 ] ( a ) and ( b ) demonstrates that the energy levels of these states are significantly closer for conformer b. the closer lying energy levels in combination with a more pronounced delocalization and thus higher transmission values result in an overall larger contribution of these double peak resonances to transport in conformer b compared to that in conformer a. despite having equivalent edge states at the fermi level , no edge - induced transport contributions are present in the junction of conformer b. as discussed in detail below , this is related to a difference in the molecule - lead coupling .",
    "the transmission peak structure related to the molecular states on the fullerenes appears at similar energies as in conformer a , and its contribution to transport is also negligible .",
    "the experimental results presented in ref .   show a pronounced dependence of the current - voltage characteristics on the polarity of the bias voltage , i.e.  asymmetric iv curves . in ref .",

    "thereby it was assumed ( cf .",
    "si of ref .  ) that in the experimental setup used , the fermi level in graphene is lowered to a similar value of that of gold ( about -5 ev ) , such that the fermi level lies in the proximity of the states .    here , we extend the analysis of ref .   with respect to the asymmetry of the iv curves . to this end , we have investigated the response of the electronic levels relevant for transport ( homo and homo-1 of the isolated molecule ) to external electric fields applied along the line connecting the centers of mass of the fullerenes . a homogeneous electric field along this direction ( cf .",
    "si of ref .  ) is included in the dft calculations .",
    "thereby , as an estimate , the bias voltage was converted to an electric field using the fullerenes center of mass distance of 2.4 nm ( electric field = bias voltage / 2.4 nm ) . due to computational limitations",
    ", we have restricted the calculations to the isolated molecule without explicit inclusion of the graphene electrodes .",
    "the transmission functions for finite fields are obtained using the wba for the coupling to the leads as described in eq .",
    "( [ wba ] ) . in this way",
    ", the effect of the electric field in the junction for different bias voltage polarities is modeled and the polarizing effect of the applied bias can be included , which is important for the asymmetries in the transport properties .",

    "the analysis for conformer a is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans - field ] .",
    "the dependence of the energy levels on the external electric field shows a typical avoided crossing with a minimum of the energy level spacing at a finite , positive field . as a consequence of the behavior of the energy levels ,",
    "the double peak structure in the transmission function also depends sensitively on the electric field , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans - field ] ( b ) for negative and ( c ) for positive field .",
    "specifically , for positive fields , the peaks between @xmath56 to @xmath57 ev are closer and the transmission is considerably enhanced , while for a negative field , the peaks are more separated and the transmission is significantly lower . taking into account additional broadening due to coupling to vibrations , this is in agreement with the experimental results which shows for lower temperatures a double peak structure with a lower current for one bias polarity but a single peak structure with higher current for the other bias polarity .    as discussed in ref .",
    ", the field dependence of the energy levels of conformer b is equivalent to that of conformer a for fields of equal strength but applied in opposite direction .",
    "therefore , a transition between the two conformations will revert the bias polarity dependence of the iv characteristics .",
    "the inversions of the asymmetries in the ivs , observed in the experiment during consecutive voltage sweeps , can be assigned to conformational changes of the molecule , namely a transition between conformer a and b. it is interesting to note that for the molecular states on the fullerenes ( cf .",
    "[ fig : confazigzag ] ( c ) ) , no distinct bias polarity dependence could be found .",
    "graphene nanoribbons exhibit electronic states localized on the zigzag edge with energies located near the fermi level.@xcite in contrast , the armchair edge does not support such localized states . in molecule - graphene nanojunction",
    ", localized edge states can contribute to transport due to the interaction with adjacent molecular resonances.@xcite an example is the junction of conformer a with zigzag terminated graphene leads , which exhibits significant contributions due to edge states , cf .",
    "[ fig : confazigzag](b ) . here ,",
    "we analyze for comparison the transport properties of graphene - molecule junctions with armchair termination of the graphene leads , as shown in fig .",

    "the results show that the contributions of the molecular states related to homo and homo-1 ( at about @xmath55 ev ) of the isolated molecule and those induced by the states localized on the fullerenes ( at about @xmath59 ev ) are almost independent on the type of graphene termination .",
    "however , the contributions from edge states close to the fermi energy , which are present in the zigzag - terminated junction of conformer a , are missing in the armchair terminated junction for both conformers . in the experiment of ref . , the existence of a well - defined zigzag termination is rather unlikely and thus edge - state transport channels are expected to be less relevant .",
    "the fact that edge - state induced transport contributions are found in the junction in conformer a with zigzag termination , but not in conformer b , can be related to a difference in the interface geometry and the resulting coupling between the molecule and the graphene leads .",
    "these investigations build on previous experimental and theoretical studies for related systems , which revealed significantly different adsorption energies , depending on the orientations , of c@xmath1 on graphene .",
    "@xcite        fig .",
    "[ fig:008 ] shows the interface geometry for the two conformers . in the junction of conformer",
    "a , the molecule binds on the left hand side via a hexagon directly oriented to the center of a graphene hexagon , which , using the notation of ref .  , corresponds to a hexagon / hole geometry .",
    "the interface on the right hand side closely resembles a pentagon / hole geometry ( cf .",
    "[ fig:008 ] ( a ) ) . for conformer b ( fig .",
    "[ fig:008 ] ( a ) ) the left hand side interface corresponds to a dimer / bridge geometry , whereas at the right hand side it is a hexagon / hole geometry .",
    "while for the hexagon / hole and pentagon / hole orientation stronger binding energies were found , the dimer / bridge geometry was observed to be less stable . in accordance with ref .  , this will lead to a lower coupling in conformer b , preventing the hybridization of edge states to become conducting states .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of the different orientations of the fullerenes relative to the graphene surface , also the coupling to the edges differs . on the right hand side in conformer",
    "a , a pentagon is oriented towards the graphene surface , which is surrounded by hexagons pointing towards the edge with zigzag termination . on the other hand , in conformer",
    "b a hexagon is pointing to the surface , whereas a hexagon and a pentagon couple to the zigzag edge . in the latter case",
    ", a weaker interaction is expected .",
    "finally , we analyze the pathways of electrons in the molecule - graphene junctions . to this end , the local transmissions as defined in eq .",

    "[ fig : localtrans - noncov ] for a selection of representative energies .",
    "thereby , local transmissions between all atoms are depicted as arrows .",
    "the color code ranging from blue to orange indicates the local transmission value . an arrow is only drawn when this value exceeds 10@xmath60 of the maximal local transmission value , which for clarity is normalized for each energy . although the sum of all local transmissions across a line vertical to the transport direction is preserved in the calculations , this conservation is not fully apparent in the plots due to the 10@xmath60 of the transmission contributions which are not shown .",
    "it is also noted that the transmission probability is absorbed in the leads beyond a certain region due to the cap applied .",
