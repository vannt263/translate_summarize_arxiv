    "as discussed above in the introduction the applicability of the ere to study near - threshold resonances , their properties and nature @xcite , could be severely limited by the presence of a nearby zero in the partial - wave amplitude .",
    "this interplay between a resonance and a close zero indeed recalls the situation with the presence of the adler zero required by chiral symmetry in the isoscalar scalar pion - pion ( @xmath161 ) scattering and the associated @xmath162 or @xmath163 resonance .",
    "the presence of this zero distorts strongly the @xmath163 resonance signal in @xmath161 scattering while for several production processes this zero is not required by any fundamental reason and it does not show up .",
    "this is why the @xmath163 resonance could be clearly observed experimentally with high statistics significance in @xmath164 decays @xcite , where the @xmath1-wave @xmath161 final - state interactions are mostly sensitive to the pion scalar form factor which is free of any low - energy zero , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for related discussions .",
    "regarding the @xmath7 there are data on event distributions for @xmath165 @xcite that show a clean event - distribution signal for this resonance without any distortion caused by a zero .",
    "however , this does not exclude that a zero could be relevant for the near - threshold @xmath0 scattering , as it indeed happens for the @xmath163 case .",
    "of course , the situation is not completely analogous because here the @xmath7 is almost on top of the @xmath0 threshold and it has a very small width , while the @xmath163 is wide and one does use the ere to study it because it is too far away from threshold .",
    "this implies that a cdd pole in the present problem on @xmath0 scattering must be really close to its threshold so as to spoil the applicability of the ere .    in this way , instead of using the ere as in refs .",
    "@xcite we employ another more general parameterization that comprises the ere up to the effective - range contribution for some limiting case but at the same time it is also valid even in the presence of a near - threshold cdd pole .",
    "this parameterization can be deduced by making use of the @xmath166 method as done in ref .",

    "@xcite . as a result of these considerations",

    "eq .  , and @xmath169 is the position of the cdd pole , also measured with respect to the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "notice that this is a pole in @xmath170 and then a zero of @xmath167 at @xmath171 . the cm three - momentum @xmath172 is calculated according to its non - relativistic expression @xmath173 where an analytical continuation up to the @xmath16 pole position has been used because of the finite width of this resonance , as also done e.g. in refs .",
    "the three - momentum @xmath172 is always defined in the 1st riemann sheet ( rs ) , so that the phase of the radicand is taken between @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the constant @xmath176 for elastic @xmath177 scattering is real but it becomes complex , with negative imaginary part , when taking into account inelasticities from other channels , such as @xmath3 , @xmath178 , etc @xcite .",
    "we finally fix this possible imaginary part in @xmath176 to zero because , as already noticed in @xcite , one can reproduce data equally well , as we have also checked .",
    "an ere of @xmath167 given in eq .   is valid in the @xmath179 complex plane with a radius of convergence coincident with @xmath180 .",
    "notice that a zero of @xmath167 near threshold implies that @xmath181 at this point and then it becomes singular . as a result , its @xmath179 expansion does not converge and ere becomes meaningless for practical applications since its radius of convergence is too small .",
    "in such a case , one must consider the full expression for @xmath167 in eq .   and",
    "not its ere , which reads @xmath182 here the ellipsis indicate higher powers of @xmath179 .",
    "this expansion can reproduce any values of the scattering length and effective range and we obtain the expressions @xmath183 it is then clear that in order to generate a large absolute value for @xmath10 , one needs a strong cancellation between the @xmath184 and @xmath176 . while to have a small magnitude of @xmath185 and a large one for @xmath186 , one would naturally expect that @xmath187 , though the explicit value of @xmath188 plays also an important role .",
    "equation clearly shows why the ere could fail to converge even for very small values of @xmath189 as long as @xmath190 .    in the limit @xmath191 with",
    "@xmath192 fixed , the parameterization in eq .   for @xmath167 reduces to the function @xmath193 used in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the inverse of the scattering length , using the notation of ref .",
    "the function @xmath193 has a bound(virtual ) state pole for positive(negative ) @xmath196 .",
    "while the near - threshold energy dependence of @xmath193 is dominated by the threshold branch - point singularity and a possible low - energy pole associated with a bound- or virtual state , this is not necessarily the case for @xmath167 as long as @xmath169 is small enough .",
    "in such a case one has to explicitly remove the cdd pole from @xmath167 by dividing it by @xmath197 .",
    "in this way , we end with the new function @xmath74 , already introduced in sec .",
    "[ subsec.191116.1 ] just before eq .  , which is then defined as @xmath198 such that its low - energy behavior is qualitatively driven by the same facts mentioned for @xmath193 .",
    "this is also the function that in general terms drives final - state interactions ( fsi ) when the scattering partial - wave is given by @xmath167 in eq .  .",
    "a detailed account on it can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , although ref .",
    "@xcite could be more accessible depending on the reader s taste and education .",

    "we have elaborated about the fact that the ere convergence radius might be severely limited due to the presence of near - threshold zeroes of the partial wave , the so - called castillejo - dalitz - dyson poles .",
    "we then derived a parameterization that is more general than the ere up to and including effective range but it can also deal with the presence of a cdd pole arbitrarily close to threshold .    we have then reproduced several event distributions around the @xmath0 threshold including those from charged @xmath4 decays measured by the babar and belle collaborations on @xmath90 and @xmath3 and the higher - statistics cdf @xmath3 event distributions from inclusive @xmath2 scattering at @xmath253  tev .",
    "our formalism has as limiting cases those of refs .",
    "@xcite , but it can also include other cases in which the presence of a cdd pole plays an important role . in this respect",
    "we are able to find other interesting scenarios that can reproduce data quite fairly beyond those found in refs .",
    "@xcite , without increasing the number of free parameters . in two of these new situations",
    "the @xmath7 is simultaneously a bound and a virtual state , while in another the @xmath7 appears as a double @xmath1-matrix pole . in the limit of vanishing @xmath16 width",
    "these two poles become degenerate and produce a second - order pole . thus",
    ", our parameterization constitutes in this case a simple example for a second - order @xmath1-matrix pole that could have a clear impact on particle physics phenomenology .",
    "further , while the compositeness is equal to 1 for the bound - state case , that we have analyzed making use of the ere including only the scattering length @xcite , it can be nearly zero for the case in which the @xmath7 is a simultaneous virtual and bound state .",
    "this is to be expected because the latter is the case with the closest cdd pole to threshold as well , even closer than the pole positions . in this respect",
    ", we also estimate that the @xmath7 is mostly @xmath177 for the virtual - state case analyzed because the cdd pole is relatively far away from threshold .    from another perspective",
    ", we have shown that using a more refined treatment of @xmath254 scattering the @xmath7 can be a a bound state , a virtual - state double pole or two types of simultaneous virtual and bound states with poles occurring in both the physical and unphysical sheets , respectively .",
    "all these scenarios can give a quite acceptable reproduction of the experimentally measured event distributions .",
    "up to some extent this situation recalls the case of the @xmath255 , for which the energy - dependent @xmath256 event distribution is nicely reproduced by purely final state interactions of @xmath257 @xcite .",
    "however , when a more elaborate model is taken , then this treatment fails to describe the data .",
    "only the generation of a @xmath257 bound state in the scattering amplitude is able to reproduce the data within this more sophisticated model @xcite . from our present results and this experience ,",
    "more efforts are still needed to finally unveil the nature of the acclaimed @xmath7 , which is the first @xmath258 state observed .",
    "we would like to thank q.  zhao and c. hanhart for interesting discussions .",

    "in order to fit the event distributions when using @xmath74 with a cdd included , the evaluation of @xmath78 entering in eq .   for calculating the event distributions requires to work out the pole position , cf .",
    "eq .  , which is not easily expressed in terms of free parameters .",
    "this is not the case when using the function @xmath193 because in this case @xmath78 , eq .",

    "thus , when @xmath74 is employed we first perform the fits such that @xmath259 is reabsorbed in the normalization constants multiplying the signal contribution . in this way one avoids having to calculate the pole position for each iteration in the fit procedure .",
    "being specific , we use the following expression for the fits to the @xmath90 event distributions [ eq : eventcddfitd ] n_i(e_i)&=&_d _ e_i-/2^e_i+/2de_0^dr(e , ) ^1/2&&\\{_d_-^de |d(e)|^2 + _ d }  . for the fits to the @xmath222 event distributions , we employ [ eq : eventcddfitj ] n_i(e_i)=_j\\{_j_e_i-/2^e_i+/2de_-^ de r(e,e)|d(e)|^2+_j }  , where @xmath260 for babar data and for belle it corresponds to the ratio of the number of @xmath227 pairs used in belle and babar for each type of @xmath261 decays , namely , @xmath262 .",
