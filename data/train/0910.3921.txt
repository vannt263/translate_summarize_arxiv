    "in 1998 , rubinstein and the second author @xcite studied the question of when there could be more than one distinct genus @xmath1 heegaard splitting of the same closed orientable @xmath0-manifold .",
    "the goal of the project was modest : to provide a complete list of ways in which such multiple splittings could be constructed , but with no claim that each example on the list did in fact have multiple non - isotopic splittings ( there could be isotopies from one splitting to another that are not apparent ) . nor was there a claim that the list had no redundancies ; a @xmath0-manifold and its multiple splittings might appear more than once on the list .",
    "such a list would still be useful , for if every example on the list could be shown to have a certain property , then that property would be true for any closed orientable @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 that has multiple genus @xmath1 splittings .",
    "two examples were given in @xcite :    * if @xmath2 is atoroidal then the hyperelliptic involutions determined by the two genus @xmath1 heegaard splittings commute . *",
    "any two genus @xmath1 heegaard splittings of @xmath2 become isotopic after a single stabilization .    despite this modest goal ,",
    "the argument in @xcite contains a gap . in 2008",
    ", the first author discovered a class of examples that do not appear on the list and which , moreover , have mathematical properties that distinguish them in important ways from the examples that do appear in @xcite .",
    "it is true that , even for the new examples , the hyperelliptic involutions commute .",
    "but we know of no argument showing that the new examples all share the second property above ; that is , we can not show that the newly discovered multiple splittings necessarily become isotopic after a single stabilization ( though they do after two stabilizations ) .    a third property , shared by all examples in @xcite but not by some of the new examples , is not listed above because the notion of hempel distance of heegaard splittings ( see @xcite ) did not exist at the time @xcite was written .",
    "but a retrospective look ( see section [ sect : distance ] below ) will verify that all the splittings described in @xcite have hempel distance no greater than @xmath1 , whereas results of the first author @xcite illustrate that at least some of the new examples have hempel distance @xmath0 .",
    "( this also verifies that the gap in the argument in @xcite actually led to missed examples . )",
    "the present paper serves as an erratum to @xcite since @xmath2 is hyperbolike . \"",
    "this leaves open an additional possibility for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which appears as subcase b in section [ sect : gap ] below . ] and describes the new examples .",
    "here is an outline : in section [ sect : dehnderiv ] we describe a general method for constructing closed orientable @xmath0-manifolds that appear to have multiple genus @xmath1 heegaard splittings ; these examples ( called _ dehn - derived _ ) are based around dehn surgery on a pair of strategically placed curves .",
    "it follows from the construction that always the hyperelliptic involutions of the alternate splittings coincide .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that curves supporting dehn - derived examples can be found , but in sections [ sect : construction1 ] and [ sect : construction2 ] we give three specific classes of examples .",
    "the classes are denoted @xmath5 ( section [ sect : construction1 ] ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( section [ sect : construction2 ] ) .",
    "( @xmath5 can be viewed as a third variation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4.2 ) . ) for the examples @xmath5 and @xmath7 a single stabilization suffices to make the alternate splittings equivalent , but this property is at least not apparent in most cases of @xmath6 .    section [ sect : gap ] describes how the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 9.5 , case 2 ) went astray and how it needs to be altered to fix the gap .",
    "the upshot is that dehn - derived examples , as described in section [ sect : dehnderiv ] , do fill the gap in the original proof . in section",
    "[ sect : taxonomy ] it is further shown , using new results in @xcite ,",
    "that _ any _ dehn - derived example is in fact of type @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : distance ] we verify that all of the old examples that are listed in @xcite are of hempel distance @xmath1 , whereas at least some dehn - derived examples are of distance @xmath0 .",

    "we briefly run through the examples as they appear in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .",
    "typically the description of an example @xmath229 in @xcite consists of two parts : a collection of annuli @xmath255 along which @xmath256 and @xmath257 are identified , followed by an arbitrary identification of @xmath258 with @xmath259 . from this point of view the simple closed curves @xmath260 that separate one sort of region from the other",

    "we will observe that in @xcite some seam is always disjoint from an essential disk in @xmath235 and an essential disk in @xmath237 .",

    "( * ? ? ? * subsection 4.2 , variation 2 ) is slightly more complicated .",
    "it is a bit like the construction in section [ sect : construction1 ] above : handlebodies @xmath61 and @xmath62 are identified along neighborhoods of all three curves @xmath263 , dehn surgery is done to all three , with @xmath57 pushed into @xmath61 and @xmath58 into @xmath62 ( then vice versa ) .",
    "but there is a meridian of @xmath61 disjoint from @xmath37 and @xmath38 and a meridian of @xmath62 disjoint from @xmath37 and @xmath58 , so a seam parallel to @xmath37 demonstrates that the splitting of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 4.2 , variation 2 ) has the disjoint curve property .    the manifolds in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 4.3 ) and ( * ? ? ? * subsection 4.4 , variations 3 , 4 , and 7 ) are all toroidal , so they are of distance @xmath242 .",
    "what remains are ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 4.4 , variations 5 and 6 ) and we adopt the terminology there .",
    "in variation 5 , with , say , @xmath264 , the seams that are the boundary of the @xmath80-punctured sphere @xmath265 are all disjoint from the meridian of the @xmath51-handle @xmath266 and , in @xmath177 , any one of these seams together with @xmath100 lie in @xmath177 as two of the @xmath25 s of section [ sect : construction1 ] above lie in @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , there is a meridian of @xmath177 disjoint from both the seam and from @xmath100 .",
