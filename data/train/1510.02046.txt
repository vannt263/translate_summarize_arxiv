    "the study of graphs associated with of various algebraic structures was initiated by beck @xcite who introduced the idea of zero divisor graph of a commutative ring with unity . till then , a lot of research , e.g. , @xcite has been done in connecting graph structures to various algebraic objects like semigroups , groups , rings , vector spaces etc . in this paper , we continue the study of one such graph called non - zero component graph @xcite of a finite dimensional vector space @xmath1 over a field @xmath2 with respect to a basis @xmath3 of @xmath1 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath2 is a finite field with @xmath4 elements , @xmath5 being a prime and @xmath6 .",
    "we study the structures of size , connectivity , maximal cliques , clique number , chromatic number and hamiltonicity of these graphs and other related concepts .",
    "in this section , for convenience of the reader and also for later use , we recall some definitions , notations and results concerning elementary graph theory . for undefined terms and concepts the reader is referred to @xcite .    by a graph @xmath7 , we mean a non - empty set @xmath8 and a symmetric binary relation ( possibly empty ) @xmath9 on @xmath8 .",
    "the set @xmath8 is called the set of vertices and @xmath9 is called the set of edges of @xmath10 .",

    "complete_. a complete subgraph of a graph @xmath10",
    "is called a _ clique_. a _ maximal clique _ is a clique which is maximal with respect to inclusion .",
    "the _ clique number _ of @xmath10 , written as @xmath18 , is the maximum size of a clique in @xmath10 .",
    "the _ chromatic number _ of @xmath10 , denoted as @xmath19 , is the minimum number of colours needed to label the vertices so that the adjacent vertices receive different colours .",
    "a subset @xmath20 of @xmath8 is said to be _ independent _ if any two vertices in that subset are pairwise non - adjacent .",
    "the _ independence number _ of a graph , @xmath21 , is the maximum size of an independent set of vertices in @xmath10 .",
    "a _ path _ of length @xmath22 in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 s are distinct ( except possibly the first and last vertices ) and @xmath25 is the edge joining @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",

    "a graph is _ connected _ if for any pair of vertices @xmath29 there exists a path joining @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a path with first and last vertices same is called a _ cycle_. a graph",
