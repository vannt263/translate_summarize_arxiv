    "an important characteristics of all these materials is a complicated electronic structure involving two or more conduction bands .",
    "the simplest model allowing appropriate description of electron correlation effects is hubbard model and its multiband generalization  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated that existence of two bands in the hubbard model gives rise to the existence of the electronic phase separation even in the absence of any type of additional factors ( spin , charge , orbital , etc . )",
    ". however , these factors are necessary to give a realistic description of the particular physical systems .",
    "for example , taking into account spin and orbital variables allows a detailed picture of the phase diagram for manganites  @xcite . including in the model the possibility of the spin - state transitions gives an explanation of the phase separation in cobaltites  @xcite .",
    "an important and vast field of research is a problem of existence of inhomogeneities in high - temperature superconductors , especially in cuprates  @xcite . in this field ,",
    "the multiband hubbard model provides some insight in the properties of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "electron - lattice coupling was incorporated in the multiband hubbard model to describe electronic structure of cuprates and manganites  @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the main emphasis was put on the polaron effects or the influence of the electron - phonon interaction on electron pairing .",
    "here we use a similar type of the electron - lattice coupling to analyze its effect on the formation of the inhomogeneous states within two - band hubbard model .",
    "let us consider a strongly correlated electron system with two types of charge carriers , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , interacting with lattice strains @xmath2 ( static dispersionless phonons ) . here , we limit ourselves to the case of small strains , @xmath3 , when the theory of elasticity is applicable .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xmath4 here , @xmath5 corresponds to the energy of charge carries without taking into account the interaction between them @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are the creation and annihilation operators for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) electrons at site @xmath11 with spin projection @xmath12 , @xmath13 means the summation over the nearest neighbors , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding hopping integrals , @xmath16 is the energy shift between @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number operators for @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons , respectively .",
    "the @xmath19 term corresponding to the on - site coulomb repulsion of charge carriers has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the energies of coulomb repulsion between two @xmath0 , two @xmath1 , and one @xmath0 and one @xmath1 electrons at one lattice site , respectively , and @xmath23 means the spin projection with the sign opposite to that of @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the on - site coulomb repulsion is large , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath26 for the simple cubic lattice considered in this paper ) and @xmath27 .    the electron - lattice interaction can be chosen in the following form @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are corresponding constants of the electron - phonon interaction and @xmath32 are the local distortions corresponding to site @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we take into account the effect of lattice strains both on the on - site electron energy and intersite charge transfer .",
    "we approximate the phonon self - energy term @xmath33 as an elastic energy of the system depending on distortions at different sites @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the elastic modulus .",
    "we analyze the problem in adiabatic approximation considering phonons as a classical static elastic field . to find a self - consistent solution to the problem , we first perform averaging of the hamiltonian over the electronic degrees of freedom . from the condition of the energy minimum with respect to strains , @xmath36",

    ".   clearly demonstrates that the effect of electron - lattice interaction is two - fold .",
    "this interaction in non - diagonal terms changes the effective bandwidth whereas in diagonal terms , it shifts the positions of the bands and the chemical potential . in the earlier analysis  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the qualitative features of the phase diagram for the two - band hubbard model are mainly determined by two dimensionless parameters : the ratio of the bandwidths and the relative positions of the bands .",
    "thus , to construct a minimal model capturing the main physical effects of electron - lattice interaction , it is sufficient to keep only @xmath29 and @xmath41 .",

    ", the chemical potential attains the bottom of the narrower band @xmath1 and this second band starts to be filled up . in this range of doping , we have two types of the electrons and the energy of the system depends on @xmath46 in a rather complicated manner due to electron - electron correlations . as we have shown earlier  @xcite ,",
    "such situation is favorable for the phase separation even in the absence of the electron - lattice interaction .",
    "however , the characteristic feature of the system under study is the dependence of the effective band shift @xmath52 on the strain and , hence , on the doping , according to eq .  .",
    "the sign of the shift depends on the signs of @xmath29 and @xmath41 .",
    "a simple analysis of eqs .   and shows that for the same signs of @xmath29 and @xmath41 the value of @xmath53 is negative and the sign of @xmath49 remains the same at any @xmath46 .",
    "if the signs of @xmath29 and @xmath41 are different , the strain can change its sign at some doping level .",
    "the change of the sign of the strain results in the change of the sign of the effective band shift @xmath54 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on doping can give rise to a more sophisticated behavior of the system .",
