    "effective @xmath0-ray production in a pulsar magnetosphere may be extended to the very high energy ( vhe ) region above 100 gev as well ; however , the predictions of fluxes by the current models of @xmath0-ray pulsars are not sufficiently conclusive ( e.g. , cheng 1994 ) .",
    "whether or not the spectra of @xmath0-ray pulsars continue up to the vhe region is a question which remains one of the interesting issues of high - energy astrophysics .    in the vhe region ,",
    "positive detections of radiation at a high confidence level have been reported from the direction of the crab , b1706 - 44 , and vela pulsars ( bowden et al .",

    "however , with respect to _ pulsed _ tev emissions , only the upper limits have been , as a rule , obtained from these pulsars ( see the references cited just above ) .",
    "if the vhe emission originates the pulsar magnetosphere , rather than the extended nebula , significant fraction of them can be expected to show a pulsation .",
    "therefore , the lack of _ pulsed _ tev emissions provides a severe constraint on the modeling of particle acceleration zones in a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "in fact , in chr picture , the magnetosphere should be optically thick for pair production in order to reduce the tev flux to an unobserved level by absorption .",
    "this in turn requires very high luminosities of tertiary photons in the infrared energy range .",
    "however , the required fluxes are generally orders of magnitude larger than the observed values ( usov 1994 ) .",
    "we are therefore motivated by the need to contrive an outer gap model which produces less tev emission with a moderate infrared luminosity .",
    "high - energy emission from a pulsar magnetosphere , in fact , crucially depends on the acceleration electric field , @xmath1 , along the magnetic field lines .",
    "it was hirotani & shibata ( 1999a , b ; hereafter paper i , ii ) who first solved the spatial distribution of @xmath1 together with particle and @xmath0-ray distribution functions .",
    "they explicitly demonstrated that there is a stationary solution for an outer gap which is formed around the null surface at which the local goldreich - julian charge density @xmath2 }    \\label{def_rhogj}\\ ] ] vanishes , where @xmath3 is the component of the magnetic field along the rotation axis , @xmath4 refers to the angular frequency of the neutron star , @xmath5 indicates the distance of the point from the rotation axis , and @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "subsequently , hirotani ( 2000a , hereafter paper iv ) investigated the @xmath0-ray emission from an outer gap , by imposing a gap closure condition that a single pair produces one pair in the gap on average .",
    "he demonstrated that @xmath1 becomes typically less than @xmath7 of the value assumed in chr and that the resultant tev flux is sufficiently less than the observational upper limit of the pulsed flux , if the outer gap is immersed in a x - ray field supplied by the blackbody radiation from the whole neutron star surface and/or from the heated polar caps . in this paper , we develop his method to the case when a magnetospheric power - law component contributes in addition to the blackbody components .    in the next section ,",
    "we formulate the gap closure condition . solving the condition in  3",
    ", we investigate the acceleration field and the resultant @xmath0-ray emissions as a function of the x - ray field . in  4 , we further apply the theory to twelve rotation - powered pulsars and predict the absolute fluxes of tev emission from their outer gaps . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss the validity of assumptions and give some implications on pulse profiles of gev emissions .",
    "we first describe the acceleration field in  2.1 , then consider the energy of curvature - radiated @xmath0-rays in  2.2 , the x - ray field illuminating the gap in  2.3 and the pair production mean free path in  2.4 .",
    "we further formulate in  2.5 the gap closure condition that one of the copious @xmath0-rays emitted by a single pair materialize as a pair in the gap on average .",

    "they are related with @xmath23 as @xmath24 and @xmath25 where the light - cylinder radius is defined by @xmath26 and the colatitude angle @xmath27 at which the last - open fieldline intersects with the light cylinder is implicitly solved from @xmath28 @xmath29 . in the order of magnitude , @xmath30 holds .",

    "it is noteworthy that the non - vanishment of @xmath39 at @xmath40 is consistent with the stability condition at the plasma - vacuum interface if the electrically supported magnetospheric plasma is completely - charge - separated , i.e. , if the plasma cloud at @xmath41 is composed of electrons alone ( krause - polstorff & michel 1985a , b ) .",
    "we assume that the goldreich - julian plasma gap boundary is stable with @xmath42 on the boundary , @xmath43 .",
    "we can now evaluate the typical strength of @xmath1 by averaging its values throughout the gap as follows : @xmath44 we shall use this @xmath45 as a representative value of the acceleration field in the gap . defining the non - dimensional gap width @xmath46 and substituting the values of @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 for @xmath32 , and @xmath49 for @xmath34 .    the voltage drop in the gap",
    "is given by @xmath50 for an outer gap which extends to the light cylinder ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 becomes as large as the available electromotive force ( emf ) exerted on the spinning neutron star surface , @xmath53v .",
    "the most effective assumption for the particle motion in the gap arises from the fact that the velocity saturates immediately after their birth in the balance between the radiation reaction force and the electric force .",
    "the reaction force is mainly due to curvature radiation if the gap is immersed in a moderate x - ray field . equating the electric force @xmath54 and the radiation reaction force",
    ", we obtain the lorentz factor of saturated particles as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 refers to the curvature radius of the magnetic field line and the magnitude of the charge on the electron .",

    "however , if the gap width @xmath63 is less than the length scale for the particles to be accelerated up to @xmath58 , the typical lorentz factor should be rather estimated by @xmath64 , because typical particles are accelerated by the potential @xmath65 .",

    ", we demonstrated that this gray approximation gave a good estimate of the gap width and other quantities describing the gap , by comparing them with those obtained in the non - gray cases in which the boltzmann equations of particles and @xmath0-rays were solved together with the poisson equation for @xmath14 .      before proceeding to the discussion on pair production",
    "mean free path , it is desirable to describe the x - ray field that illuminates the outer gap .",
    "x - ray field of a rotation - powered neutron star within the light cylinder can be attributed to the following three emission processes : + ( 1 ) photospheric emission from the whole surface of a cooling neutron star ( greenstein & hartke 1983 ; romani 1987 ; shibanov et al . 1992 ; pavlov et al .",

    "the spectrum of the first component is expected to be expressed with a modified blackbody . however , for simplicity , we approximate it in terms of a plank function with temperature @xmath72 , because the x - ray spectrum is occasionally fitted by a simple blackbody spectrum .",
    "we regard a blackbody component as the first one if its observed emitting area is comparable with the whole surface of a neutron star , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the neutron star radius . we take account of both the pulsed and the non - pulsed surface blackbody emission as this soft blackbody component .    as for the second component , we regard a blackbody component as the heated polar cap emission if its observed emitting area is much smaller than @xmath75 .",

    "to get rid of the nebula emission , which illuminates the outer gap inefficiently , we adopt only the pulsed components of a power - law emission as the third component .      in this subsection , we draw attention to how the pair production mean free path is related with the x - ray field described in the previous section . to this end , we first give the threshold energy for x - ray photons to materialize . then",

    "the collisional angle on the poloidal plane becomes @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) for outwardly ( or inwardly ) propagating @xmath0-rays , where @xmath22 is computed from equation ( [ eq : def - thnull ] ) .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath85 , where the upper and the lower sign correspond to the outwardly and inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays , respectively . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath34 , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) to obtain @xmath89 .",
    "we first consider the pair production mean free path , @xmath90 , for a @xmath0-ray photon to materialize in a collision with one of the _ soft _ blackbody x - rays . in a realistic outer gap , both the outwardly and inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays contribute for @xmath90 .",

    "this value of @xmath110 was justified in the final section of paper iv .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us consider the case when the x - ray field is dominated by the _ hard _ blackbody component .",

    "the secondary photons emitted outside of the gap via synchrotron process will be beamed in the same direction of the primary @xmath0-rays , the typical collision angle on the poloidal plane can be approximated as @xmath46 rad .",

    "we may notice here that both the @xmath0-rays and the magnetospheric , power - law x - rays suffer aberration and that the resultanlt collision angle in the azimuthal direction is less than @xmath80 and can be assumed to be @xmath127 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath123 on @xmath8 is unknown .",
    "we thus simply assume that it is constant throughout the gap and specify the form as @xmath128 the photon index @xmath129 is typically between @xmath130 and @xmath131 for a pulsed , power - law x - ray component in hard x - ray band ( e.g. , saito 1998 ) .",
    "the true mean path , @xmath132 , is determined by the component that dominates the x - ray field , or equivalently , the smallest one among @xmath90 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably evaluate @xmath132 as @xmath135    when a pulsar is young , the third term will dominate because of its strong magnetospheric emission . as the pulsar evolves , the first term will become dominant owing to the diminishing magnetospheric emission .",
    "as the pulsar evolves further , polar cap heating due to particle bombardment begins to dominate ; therefore , the second term becomes important .",
    "the gap width @xmath136 is adjusted so that a single pair produces copious @xmath0-ray photons ( of number @xmath137 ) one of which materializes as a pair on average .",
    "since a typical @xmath0-ray photon runs the length @xmath63 in the gap before escaping from either of the boundaries , the probability of a @xmath0-ray photon to materialize within the gap , @xmath138 , must coincide with the optical depth for absorption , @xmath139 .",

    "the millisecond pulsar b1821 - 24 has a very strong magnetic field ( @xmath222 g ) at the gap center .",
    "its strong ( @xmath223 ) x - ray field prevents the gap to extend in the magnetosphere . as a result",
    ", @xmath162 is relatively small compared with other pulsars .",
    "for the three middle - aged pulsars b0656 + 14 , geminga , and b1055 - 52 , their power - law components are too weak to dominate the surface blackbody emissions ; the surface emissions are also weak ( @xmath224 ) to allow the gaps to extend more than @xmath7 of @xmath215 . however",
    ", the extended gaps do not mean large intrinsic gev luminosities , because their small magnetic fields ( @xmath225 g ) suppress the acceleration field .",
    "in the case of geminga , its proximity leads to a large gev flux .    in the case of the millisecond pulsar j0437 - 4715 , its weak x - ray field ( @xmath226 ) due to the soft and hard blackbody emissions results in an extended gap .",
    "this active gap , together with its proximity , leads to a large gev flux next to geminga .",
    "however , its relatively strong magnetic field ( @xmath221 g ) at the gap center may indicate the presence of an additional power - law component , which reduces the gap width and hence the gev flux .",
    "therefore , further hard x - ray observations are necessary for this millisecond pulsar .",
    "if an electron or a positron is migrating with lorentz factor @xmath227 in an isotropic photon field , it upscatters the soft photons to produce the following number spectrum of @xmath0-rays ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) : @xmath228 ,    \\label{eq : spc_tev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath229 and @xmath230 ; here , @xmath231 refers to the energy of the upscattered photons in @xmath232 unit .",
    "substituting the infrared photon spectrum @xmath233 , integrating @xmath234 over @xmath235 , and multiplying the @xmath0-ray energy ( @xmath236 ) and the electron number ( @xmath163 ) in the gap , we obtain the flux density of the upscattered , tev photons as a function of @xmath231 .",
    "we compute the tev spectra of individual pulsars and summarize the results in table  3 ; the @xmath186 peak frequencies and the fluxes are given in the last two columns .",
    "moreover , for the three brightest pulsars ( crab , b0656 + 14 , b1509 - 58 ) , their computed @xmath186 spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : spc_tev ] .",
    "it follows from table  3 and figure  [ fig : spc_tev ] that the tev emissions are invisible with the current ground - based telescopes , except for crab and b0656 + 14 . since @xmath63 becomes as small as @xmath237 for the crab pulsar , significant fraction of the particles",
    "are , in fact , unsaturated .",
    "therefore , the expected tev flux is overestimated . to constrain the absolute pulsed tev flux from the crab pulsar , we must discard the mono - energetic approximation for the particle distribution function and explicitly solve the boltzmann equations of particles and @xmath0-rays , together with the poisson equation for @xmath14 , under suitable boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , considering the fact that the tertiary infrared photons are not isotropic but have small collision angles with the particles , we can understand that the tev flux computed from equation  ( [ eq : spc_tev ] ) are , in general , overestimated .",
    "for b1055 - 52 and b0656 + 14 , the emitting areas of the soft blackbody components are unnaturally large . therefore , more accurate x - ray observations are necessary for a quantitative prediction of their tev fluxes .",
    "it is worth noting that the tev fluxes are less than @xmath238 of the gev fluxes except for crab , b0540 - 69 , and b0656 + 14 ; this conclusion is qualitatively consistent with romani ( 1996 ) .",
    "the predicted tev flux from b0540 - 69 is greater than the gev flux , because ( for @xmath32 for instance ) its infrared photon number density in the energy interval 0.01 ev and 0.1 ev attains @xmath239 , which well exceeds the x - ray number density @xmath240 between 0.1 kev and 100 kev .",
    "to sum up , we have considered the electrodynamic structure of an outer gap accelerator in which relativistic particles emit @xmath0-rays via curvature process . imposing the gap closure condition that a single pair produces one pair in the gap on average , we solve selfconsistently the gap width as a function of the x - ray fields and the pulsar parameters .",
    "once the gap width is known , we can further compute the acceleration field and the resultant @xmath0-ray emissions .",
    "it was demonstrated that the luminosities of gev and tev emissions are a decreasing function of the x - ray energy and number density .",
    "we also showed that the expected @xmath186 fluxes ( @xmath241jy  hz ) of ic - scattered , tev @xmath0-rays from the outer gaps of rotation - powered pulsars are less than the observational upper limits , except for crab and b0656 + 14 . for crab , energy - dependent particle distribution function",
    "should be considered , whereas for b0656 + 14 , more accurate x - ray observations are required .",
    "it is concluded that the difficulty of excessive tev emission , which appears in the chr picture , does not arise in the present outer gap model .",
    "the outer gap in the present model is stable , regardless of whether the x - ray field is dominated by a surface blackbody or a magnetospheric power - law component .",
    "consider the case when the gap width @xmath63 slightly increases as an initial perturbation .",
    "it increases both @xmath1 and @xmath52 , which in turn increases both @xmath71 and @xmath137 .",
    "the increase of @xmath71 results in the decrease of @xmath242 .",
    "+ * ( 1 ) * when the surface blackbody dominates the x - ray field , the x - ray spectrum and luminosity are unchanged by the perturbation .",
    "therefore , the decrease of @xmath242 implies the decrease of @xmath243 or @xmath244 and hence @xmath132 .",
    "+ * ( 2 ) * when the magnetospheric emission dominates , the secondary and tertiary emissions will increase with @xmath71 and @xmath137 ; therefore , @xmath208 increases as well .",
    "accordingly , the decrease of @xmath242 and the increase of @xmath208 imply a significant decrease of @xmath245 and hence @xmath132 .",
    "+ in either case , it follows that @xmath132 decreases owing to the initial increase of @xmath63 . reminding the gap closure condition @xmath246",
    ", we find a negative feedback which cancels the initial perturbation of @xmath63 .",
    "let us discuss the expected sharpness of gev pulses .",
    "it seems unlikely that the azimuthal width of the gap increases with decreasing @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , it would be possible to argue that the solid angle in which the primary @xmath0-rays are emitted decreases as the arc of the gap along the last open field line ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) decreases . on these grounds",
    ", we can expect a sharp pulse when @xmath158 holds , such as for crab and j0822 - 4300 .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the same conclusion can be expected for millisecond pulsars and magnetars . in the case of a millisecond pulsar",
    ", its fast rotation shrinks the light cylinder .",
    "in such a small - volume magnetosphere , the outer gap is immersed in a dense magnetospheric , power - law x - ray emission . as a result",
    ", @xmath132 decreases to reduce @xmath155 . in the case of a magnetar",
    ", its strong magnetic field makes the expansion coefficient @xmath17 in equation ( [ eq : poisson-2 ] ) be large .",
    "therefore , a very thin ( @xmath158 ) gap with a strong @xmath1 would be expected . in short , for young pulsars , millisecond pulsars , and magnetars ,",
    "their high - energy pulsations are expected to show sharp peaks .",
    "first , we reduced the poisson equation into the one - dimensional form ( eq.[[eq : poisson-2 ] ] ) , by assuming @xmath247 .",
    "let us briefly consider the two - dimensional effect due to the transfield derivative in the poisson equation .",
    "when @xmath168 becomes small , the gap shifts outwards , @xmath1 is partially screened , and @xmath63 enlarges ( fig .  12 in paper i ; see also cheng , ho , & rudermann 1986a for a screened , or spatially constant @xmath1 in a thin gap ) .",
    "owing to the screened acceleration field , the gev and tev fluxes becomes small compared with those obtained in @xmath247 case . on these grounds",
    ", we can constrain the upper limit of the tev fluxes in the transversely thick limit , @xmath247 .     secondly , let us discuss the case when the assumption of the vacuum gap breaks down . in this case , the charges in the gap partially cancel the original @xmath1 obtained in the vacuum gap ( eq . [ [ eq : poisson-2 ] ] ) . the partially screened @xmath1 results in the decrease of the tev fluxes . on these grounds ,",
    "we can regard the tev fluxes presented in the present paper as the firm upper limits .",
    "thirdly , we consider the influence of cyclotron resonance scatterings .",
    "for one thing , the _ soft _ blackbody emission from the whole surface may be scattered to be anisotropic ( daugherty & harding 1989 ) .",
    "such effects are important for polar cap models , because the collision angles ( @xmath248 ) suffer significant corrections .",
    "nevertheless , in an outer gap , such corrections are negligibly small .",
    "moreover , the cyclotron resonance increases the effective emitting area and decreases the temperature . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect these two effects in this paper , because they cancel each other . for example , the decreased temperature results in a decrease of the target photons above a certain threshold energy for pair production . on the other hand ,",
    "the increased emitting area increases the number of target photons above the threshold , thereby cancel the effect of the decreased temperature .",
    "what is more , the _ hard _ blackbody emission from the heated polar caps may be scattered to be smeared out .",
    "that is , most of the hard x - rays may be scattered back to the stellar surface owing to cyclotron resonance scatterings and reemitted as soft x - rays ( halpern & ruderman 1993 ) . in this case , the hard component will be indistinguishable with the original soft component due to the neutron - star cooling .",
    "nevertheless , for older pulsars such as b0656 + 14 and b1055 - 52 , these effect seems to be ineffective probably due to their less dense electrons around the polar cap near the neutron star surface .",
    "curvature - radiated luminosity , @xmath162 , has a weak dependence on the spin - down luminosity , @xmath249 , if we fix the transfield thickness of the gap , @xmath250 . in another word ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath250 is crucial to discuss the @xmath251 relation ( thompton et al .",
    "1994 ; nel et al .",
    "1996 ) . to solve @xmath168",
    ", we must analyze the two - dimensional poisson equation on the poloidal plane ; however , it is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "as we have seen , the accelerated particles reach curvature - radiation reaction limit to become roughly monoenergetic .",
    "the curvature spectrum in lower energies then becomes a power law with a spectral index @xmath252 , which is much harder than the observed @xmath0-ray pulsar spectra . in this subsection , we demonstrate that the @xmath0-ray spectrum below a certain energy ( say @xmath253 mev ) is dominated by a synchrotron radiation from freshly born particles and that the expected @xmath0-ray spectra further softens .    as an example exhibiting a soft power - law @xmath0-ray spectrum from ev to gev energies , we consider the crab pulsar . to discriminate whether curvature or synchrotron process dominates , we separately consider each process and take the ratio of the radiation - reaction forces .",
    "that is , we ignore much complicated synchro - curvature process , because such details are not important for the present purpose .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath34 , which gives @xmath254 at the gap center . since the curvature - radiated @xmath0-ray energy is @xmath255 gev , the freshly born particles have the lorentz factors of @xmath256 .",
    "a particle with this lorentz factor emit synchrotron radiation around the energy @xmath257 where @xmath258 denotes the pitch angle of the particles .",
    "we can solve the evolution of the lorentz factor and @xmath258 simultaneously by the method described in   5.3 of paper",
    "i. we present the evolution of @xmath259 due to synchrotron radiation shortly after the pair production in figure  [ fig : pitch ] , and the evolution of the longitudinal momenta in figure  [ fig : synch ] . in both figures , the abscissa designates the distance along the fieldlines in @xmath215 unit with respect to the birth place ( distance@xmath260 ) .",
    "the particles are supposed to be created with positive momenta ; therefore , electrons turn back to have negative longitudinal momenta . positrons",
    "lose longitudinal momenta on the initial stage of acceleration , because the relativistic beaming effect causes the synchrotron - radiation - reaction force not only in the transverse but also in the longitudinal directions .",
    "it follows from figure  [ fig : pitch ] that we can approximate @xmath261 when the particles have not run @xmath262 for @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath258 is kept around @xmath156 , lorentz factors are also in the same order of @xmath263 . substituting @xmath264 and @xmath256 into equation ( [ eq : synchro_ec ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath265 mev as the central energy of the synchrotron spectrum for @xmath34 .",
    "the fraction of the particles having @xmath266 and lorentz factor @xmath267 to the saturated particles then becomes @xmath268    we can estimate the ratio between the synchrotron radiation from the freshly born particles and the curvature radiation from the saturated particles as follows : @xmath269 where @xmath270 @xmath271 @xmath272 @xmath273 refers to the modified bessel function of 5/3 order ; @xmath67 in equation  ( [ eq : def_pcurv ] ) denotes the saturated lorentz factor and becomes @xmath274 for @xmath108 for crab . at the synchrotron peak energy , @xmath275 mev",
    ", the ratio becomes @xmath276 .",
    "in addition , in the case of crab , the unsaturated motion of particles ( @xmath282 ) implies that the synchro - curvature radiation from unsaturated particles are also important .",
    "therefore , the spectrum below gev will become much softer compared with the simple curvature spectrum with central energy @xmath255 ( or @xmath283 ) gev for @xmath34 ( or @xmath284 ) .      finally , we point out the difference between the present work and zhang and cheng ( 1997 ) ; they considered a gap closure condition so that the curvature - radiated @xmath0-ray energy may be adjusted just above the threshold of pair production .",
    "that is , they considered the @xmath0-ray energy to be about @xmath285 , where @xmath286 refers to the characteristic x - ray energy . by equating @xmath287 with the central energy of curvature radiation ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : ec ] ] in our notation ) , they closed the equations . when the soft ( or hard ) blackbody emission dominates , @xmath286 can be approximated by @xmath288 ( or @xmath289 ) .",
    "the model of zhang and cheng ( 1997 ) is , in fact , qualitatively consistent with our gap closure condition , provided that the x - ray are supplied by the soft or hard blackbody emission .",
    "more specifically , our model gives about 2 times larger characteristic @xmath0-ray energy compared with their model . to see this , we present in figure  [ fig : cfzc ] the ratio between @xmath71 computed from equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) and @xmath287 ; the hard blackbody or the power - law components are not considered in this calculation .",
    "the abscissa indicates the soft blackbody temperature , @xmath72 .",
    "for the three thick curves , @xmath161 is fixed at @xmath280 ; the solid , dashed , and dotted lines corresponds to @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and @xmath156 , respectively . for the two thin curves , on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath292 is fixed at @xmath111 ; the dashed and dotted curves corresponds to @xmath293 and @xmath294 , respectively . at small @xmath72 ,",
    "our model gives more than twice greater @xmath0-ray energy compared with zhang and cheng ( 1997 ) ; nevertheless , the difference is not very prominent",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that the spectra of the x - ray radiation are explicitly considered in our present model in the sense we perform the integration over x - ray energies in equations ( [ eq : def_lambda_4 ] ) , ( [ eq : def_lambda_5 ] ) , and ( [ eq : def_lambda_3 ] ) and that the additional , power - law component is considered in our present model .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the back reaction of the accelerated particles on the polar cap heating , which was deeply investigated by zhang and cheng ( 1997 ) .",
    "consider the case when the voltage drop in the gap approaches the surface emf , @xmath295 .",
    "such an active gap will supply copious relativistic primary particles to heat up the polar cap due to bombardment .",
    "the resultant hard blackbody emission supplies target photons for pair production to make the realistic solution deviate from the thick solid curve and approach thin curves at small @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : width ] ) .",
    "therefore , this sort of back reaction on the x - ray field due to the relativistic particles needs further consideration .",

    "<S> we study the gamma - ray emissions from an outer - magnetospheric potential gap around a rotating neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> migratory electrons and positrons are accelerated by the electric field in the gap to radiate copious gamma - rays via curvature process . some of these gamma - rays materialize as pairs by colliding with the x - rays in the gap , leading to a pair production cascade . imposing the closure condition that a single pair produces one pair in the gap on average , we explicitly solve the strength of the acceleration field and demonstrate how the peak energy and the luminosity of the curvature - radiated , gev photons depend on the strength of the surface blackbody and the power - law emissions . </S>",
    "<S> some predictions on the gev emission from twelve rotation - powered pulsars are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that the expected pulsed tev fluxes are consistent with their observational upper limits . </S>",
    "<S> an implication of high - energy pulse phase width versus pulsar age , spin , and magnetic moment is discussed . </S>"
