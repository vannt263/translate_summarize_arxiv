    "galaxy redshift surveys via the spectroscopic measurements of individual galaxies provide a three - dimensional map of galaxy distribution , which includes valuable cosmological information on structure formation of the universe .",
    "the observed galaxy distribution is , however , apparently distorted due to the peculiar velocity of galaxies that systematically affects the redshift determination of each galaxy .",
    "the anisotropy caused by peculiar velocities is referred to as the _ redshift distortion _ , which complicates the interpretation of the galaxy clustering data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , redshift distortion provides a unique way to measure the growth rate of structure formation , which has been previously used for determining the density parameters of the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is now recognized with great interest as a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "redshift distortion also provides a helpful information on the dark - sector interactions @xcite , where the dark energy is dynamically coupled with dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) . note that the distortion of the galaxy clustering pattern also arises from the apparent mismatch of the underlying cosmology when we convert the redshift and angular position of each galaxy to the comoving radial and transverse distances",
    "this is known as alcock - paczynski effect @xcite , and with the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) as a robust standard ruler , it can be utilized for a simultaneous measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath2 and angular diameter distance @xmath3 of distant galaxies at redshift @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in these respects ,",
    "anisotropic clustering data from galaxy redshift surveys serve as a dual cosmological probe of the cosmic expansion and the gravity on cosmological scales , from which we can address properties of both the dark energy and modification of gravity responsible for the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "although current data are not yet sensitive enough to separately measure @xmath2 , @xmath3 and growth rate ( see @xcite for current status ) , planned and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys aim at precisely measuring the anisotropic power spectrum and/or two - point correlation function in redshift space .",
    "thus , the accurate theoretical modeling of anisotropic power spectrum is crucial and needs to be developed toward future observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address these issues based on the the analytical treatment of non - linear gravitational clustering . in the single - stream limit",
    ", cosmological evolution of the mass distribution consisting of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryon is described by the coupled equations for irrotational and pressureless fluid @xcite .",
    "recently , a detailed study on the standard treatments of perturbation theory has been made @xcite , and several improved treatments have been proposed , showing that a percent - level accuracy can be achieved for the predictions of power spectrum or two - point correlation function in real space . with a help of these , in this paper",
    ", we will develop a model of redshift distortion , and compute the matter power spectrum in redshift space , with a particular attention to the baos .",
    "also , we discuss the impact of model uncertainty of the redshift distortion on the acoustic - scale measurement of baos and the estimation of growth rate parameter .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : pk_in_red ] , we start with writing down the relation between real space and redshift space , and derive an exact expression for matter power spectrum in redshift space .",
    "we then consider the existing theoretical models of redshift distortion , and compare those with n - body simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec : existing_model ] , showing that non - negligible discrepancy appears at the scales of baos . in sec .",
    "[ sec : improved_model ] , non - linear corrections relevant to describe the small discrepancies are derived based on the exact expression of redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "the new model of redshift distortion including the corrections reproduces the n - body simulations quite well in both the monopole and quadrupole components of redshift - space power spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : implication ] , the relevance of this new model is discussed in details , especially for measurements of acoustic scales and growth rate parameters . the potential impact of the model of redshift distortion on future constraints on modified gravity and dark energy is also estimated based on fisher matrix formalism . finally , our important findings are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .    throughout the paper , we assume a flat @xmath5cdm model and adopt the fiducial cosmological parameters based on the five - year wmap results @xcite : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in order to compare our analytic results with n - body simulations ,",
    "the data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath12 independent n - body simulations of the @xmath13 particles and cubic boxes of side length @xmath14gpc were carried out with initial conditions created by ` 2lpt ` code @xcite at @xmath15 , adopting the same cosmological parameters as mentioned above .",
    "let us first recall that the redshift distortion arises from the apparent mismatch of galaxy position between real and redshift spaces caused by the contamination of the peculiar velocities in the redshift measurement . for distant galaxies , the position in real space , @xmath16 ,",
    "is mapped to the one in redshift space , @xmath17 , as @xmath18 where the unit vector @xmath19 indicates the line - of - sight direction , and quantity @xmath20 is the line - of - sight component of the velocity field , i.e , @xmath21 .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the scale factor of the universe and the hubble parameter , respectively . then , the density field in redshift space , @xmath24 , is related to the one in real space , @xmath25 through the relation @xmath26 , which leads to @xmath27 the fourier transform of this is given by @xmath28 where the quantity @xmath29 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here , we used the fact that the jacobian @xmath32 is written as @xmath33 .    from this , the power spectrum of density in redshift space becomes @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the ensemble average .",
    "we defined @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath39 is the logarithmic derivative of linear growth function @xmath40 given by @xmath41 .",
    "this is the exact expression for power spectrum in redshift space , and no dynamical information for velocity and density fields , i.e. , euler equation and/or continuity equation , is invoked in deriving this equation .    in the expression ( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) , the power spectrum is written as function of @xmath42 and @xmath29 , and is related to the statistical average of real - space quantities in a complicated manner , but qualitative effects on clustering amplitude of power spectrum are rather clear , i.e. , enhancement and damping , well known as kaiser and finger - of - god effects .",
    "the kaiser effect basically comes from the braces in the right hand side of the expression ( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) , which represents the coherent distortion by the peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight direction . in linear theory , the relation @xmath43 holds and the strength of clustering anisotropies is controlled by the growth rate parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this is the basic reason why the redshift distortion attracts much attention as a powerful indicator for growth of structure . on the other hand ,",
    "finger - of - god effect roughly comes from the factor @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) . due to the randomness of peculiar velocities , de - phasing arises and it leads to the suppression of clustering amplitude .",
    "the apparent reduction of amplitude becomes especially significant around the halo forming regions .",
    "of course , these two effects can not be separately treated in principle , and a mixture of kaiser and finger - of - god effects is expected to be significant on trans - linear regime , where a tight correlation between velocity and density fields still remains .",
    "this is of particular importance for the accurate modeling of baos . before addressing detailed modeling ,",
    "however , we will first consider currently existing models of redshift distortion , and examine how these models fail to reproduce the major trends of bao features in redshift space .",
    "let us first examine the perturbation theory ( pt ) based model of redshift distortion .",
    "we here specifically deal with the two representative models : one - loop pt calculations for redshift - space power spectrum from standard pt and lagrangian pt .",
    "the standard pt usually implies a straightforward expansion of the the cosmic fluid equations around their linear solution , assuming that the amplitudes of density and velocity fields are small .",
    "this treatment is also applied to the evaluation of redshift - space power spectrum ( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) , and the resultant expressions for one - loop power spectrum is schematically summarized as ( see @xcite for complete expressions ) @xmath45 the first term in the right - hand side is the linear - order result of the redshift - space power spectrum , and the factor @xmath46 multiplied by the linear power spectrum @xmath47 indicates the enhancement due to the kaiser effect . the second term @xmath48 represents a collection of the leading - order mode - coupling terms called one - loop correction , arising both from the gravitational clustering and the redshift distortion .",
    "this term is basically of the forth order in linear - order density or velocity fields , and is roughly proportional to @xmath49 with @xmath50 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lagrangian pt description of the redshift - space power spectrum is obtained in somewhat different way . intuitively , we rewrite the exact expression ( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) in terms of the displacement vector , and the perturbative expansion is applied to the displacement vector .",
    "although a naive perturbative treatment merely reproduces the standard pt result ( [ eq : pk_spt ] ) , ref .",
    "@xcite has applied a partial expansion , and some of the terms has been kept in some non - perturbative ways .",
    "the resultant expressions for power spectrum in redshift space becomes @xmath51 ,   \\label{eq : pk_lpt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath52 is the linear - order estimate of the one - dimensional velocity dispersion given by @xmath53 the exponential prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pk_lpt ] ) can be regarded as the result of non - perturbative treatment , and in redshift space , this term accounts for the non - linear damping of the baos arising both from the gravitational clustering and finger - of - god effect of redshift distortion .",

    "the multipole moment of two - dimensional power spectrum is defined by @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the legendre polynomials .    as it has been repeatedly stated in the literature @xcite ,",
    "the standard pt treatment is not sufficiently accurate to describe the baos .",
    "[ fig : ratio_pk_red_pt ] confirms that this is indeed true not only in real space , but also in redshift space . while the power spectrum amplitude of n - body simulations tends to be smaller than that of the linear theory prediction ( dotted ) , the predicted amplitude of standard pt generally overestimates the n - body results , and it exceeds the linear prediction on small scales .",
    "compared to the results in real space , the discrepancy between prediction and simulation seems a bit large .",
    "contrastingly , in the lagrangian pt calculation , the amplitude of power spectrum is rather suppressed , and a better agreement between prediction and simulation is achieved at low-@xmath42 .",
    "this is due to the exponential prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pk_lpt ] ) . as a trade - off",
    ", however , the predicted amplitude at higher @xmath42 modes largely underestimates the result of n - body simulations .",
    "further , a closer look at first peak of baos around @xmath62mpc@xmath63 reveals a small discrepancy , which becomes significant as decreasing the redshift and can produce few % errors in power spectrum amplitude .",
    "these results indicate that the existing pt based approaches fail to describe the two competitive effects of redshift distortion in the power spectrum .",
    "a proper account of these is thus essential in accurately modeling baos .",

    "since the finger - of - god effect is thought to be a fully non - linear effect , which mostly comes from the virialized random motion of the mass ( or galaxy ) residing at a halo , the prediction of @xmath67 seems rather difficult . our primary purpose is to model the shape and structure of acoustic feature in the power spectrum , and the precise form of the damping is basically irrelevant .",

    "<S> contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature , the new model includes the corrections arising from the non - linear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion , i.e. , kaiser and finger - of - god effects . based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering , we compare our model predictions with monopole and quadrupole power spectra of n - body simulations , and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of baos . </S>",
    "<S> potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift - space power spectrum are also investigated based on the fisher - matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter by @xmath0 , and the growth rate parameter by @xmath1 , which would become non - negligible for future galaxy surveys . </S>",
    "<S> correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential , and the new prescription of redshift - space power spectrum including the non - linear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic baos . </S>"
