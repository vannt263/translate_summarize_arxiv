    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is located at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "it accelerates heavy ions up to a top energy of 100 gev per nucleon , per beam .",
    "the maximum center of mass energy for au+au collisions is @xmath1 gev per nucleon .",
    "each collision produces a large number of charged particles . for example",
    ", a central au - au collision will produce more than 1000 primary particles per unit of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "the average transverse momentum per particle is about 500 mev / c .",
    "each collision also produces a high flux of secondary particles that are due to the interaction of the primary particles with the material in the detector , and the decay of short lived primaries .",
    "these secondary particles must be tracked and identified along with the primary particles in order to accomplish the physics goals of the experiment .",
    "thus , rhic is a very demanding environment in which to operate a detector .",
    "the star detector@xcite uses the tpc as its primary tracking device@xcite .",
    "the tpc records the tracks of particles , measures their momenta , and identifies the particles by measuring their ionization energy loss ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "its acceptance covers @xmath3 units of pseudo - rapidity through the full azimuthal angle and over the full range of multiplicities .",
    "particles are identified over a momentum range from 100 mev / c to greater than 1 gev / c , and momenta are measured over a range of 100 mev / c to 30 gev / c .",
    "the star tpc is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ tpcman ] .",
    "it sits in a large solenoidal magnet that operates at 0.5 t@xcite .",
    "the tpc is 4.2 m long and 4 m in diameter .",
    "it is an empty volume of gas in a well defined , uniform , electric field of @xmath4 135 v / cm .",
    "the paths of primary ionizing particles passing through the gas volume are reconstructed with high precision from the released secondary electrons which drift to the readout end caps at the ends of the chamber .",
    "the uniform electric field which is required to drift the electrons is defined by a thin conductive central membrane ( cm ) at the center of the tpc , concentric field - cage cylinders and the readout end caps .",
    "electric field uniformity is critical since track reconstruction precision is sub - millimeter and electron drift paths are up to 2.1 meters .",
    "the readout system is based on multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) with readout pads .",
    "the drifting electrons avalanche in the high fields at the 20 @xmath5 m anode wires providing an amplification of 1000 to 3000 .",
    "the positive ions created in the avalanche induce a temporary image charge on the pads which disappears as the ions move away from the anode wire .",
    "the image charge is measured by a preamplifier / shaper / waveform digitizer system .",
    "the induced charge from an avalanche is shared over several adjacent pads , so the original track position can be reconstructed to a small fraction of a pad width .",
    "there are a total of 136,608 pads in the readout system .",
    "the tpc is filled with p10 gas ( 10% methane , 90% argon ) regulated at 2 mbar above atmospheric pressure@xcite .",
    "this gas has long been used in tpcs .",
    "it s primary attribute is a fast drift velocity which peaks at a low electric field .",
    "operating on the peak of the velocity curve makes the drift velocity stable and insensitive to small variations in temperature and pressure .",
    "low voltage greatly simplifies the field cage design .",
    "the design and specification strategy for the tpc have been guided by the limits of the gas and the financial limits on size .",
    "diffusion of the drifting electrons and their limited number defines the position resolution .",
    "ionization fluctuations and finite track length limit the @xmath2 particle identification .",
    "the design specifications were adjusted accordingly to limit cost and complexity without seriously compromising the potential for tracking precision and particle identification .",
    "table [ majorparam ] lists some basic parameters for the star tpc .",
    "the measured tpc performance has generally agreed with standard codes such as magboltz@xcite and garfield@xcite . only for the most detailed studies",
    "has it been necessary to make custom measurements of the electrostatic or gas parameters ( e.g. the drift velocity in the gas ) .",
    ".basic parameters for the star tpc and its associated hardware . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      cm.,width=529 ]      the inner and outer sub - sectors have different size pads and so their two - hit resolutions are different .",
    "figure [ ftwohit ] shows the efficiency of finding two hits as a function of the distance separating them .",
    "the efficiency depends on whether the track segment is observed in the inner or the outer sub - sectors .",
    "the efficiency is the ratio of the distributions of the distance separating 2 hits from the same event and 2 hits from different events .",
    "two hits can be completely resolved when they are separated in the padrow direction ( i.e. along the local @xmath6 axis ) by at least 0.8 cm in the inner sector and 1.3 cm in the outer sector .",
    "similarly , two hits are completely resolved when they are separated in the drift direction ( i.e. along the @xmath7 axis ) by 2.7 cm in the inner sector and 3.2 cm in the outer sector .",
    "axis and the pad row direction is along the local @xmath6 axis.,width=529 ]      the tracking software performs two distinct tasks .",
    "first , the algorithms associate space points to form tracks and , second , they fit the points on a track with a track - model to extract information such as the momentum of the particle . the track - model is , to first order , a helix .",
    "second order effects include the energy lost in the gas which causes a particle trajectory to deviate slightly from the helix . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the efficiency of finding tracks with the software .",
    "the tracking efficiency depends on the acceptance of the detector , the electronics detection efficiency , as well as the two - hit separation capability of the system .",
    "the acceptance of the tpc is 96% for high momentum tracks traveling perpendicular the beamline .",
    "the 4% inefficiency is caused by the spaces between the sectors which are required to mount the wires on the sectors .",
    "the software also ignores any space points that fall on the last 2 pads of a pad row .",
    "this fiducial cut is applied to avoid position errors that result from tracks not having symmetric pad coverage on both sides of the track .",
    "it also avoids possible local distortions in the drift field .",
    "this fiducial cut reduces the total acceptance to 94% .",
    "the detection efficiency of the electronics is essentially 100% except for dead channels and the dead channel count is usually below 1% of the total .",
    "however , the system can not always separate one hit from two hits on adjacent pads and this merging of hits reduces the tracking efficiency .",
    "the software also applies cuts to the data .",
    "for example , a track is required to have hits on at least 10 pad rows because shorter tracks are too likely to be broken track fragments . but this cut can also remove tracks traveling at a small angle with respect to the beamline and low momentum particles that curl up in the magnetic field .",
    "since the merging and minimum pad rows effects are non - linear , we ca nt do a simple calculation to estimate their effects on the data .",
    "we can simulate them , however .    in order to estimate the tracking efficiency ,",
    "we embed simulated tracks inside real events and then count the number of simulated tracks that are in the data after the track reconstruction software has done its job .",
    "the technique allows us to account for detector effects and especially the losses related to a high density of tracks .",
    "the simulated tracks are very similar to the real tracks and the simulator tries to take into account all the processes that lead to the detection of particles including : ionization , electron drift , gas gain , signal collection , electronic amplification , electronic noise , and dead channels .",
    "the results of the embedding studies indicate that the systematic error on the tracking efficiency is about 6% .",
    "figure [ fefficiency ] shows the pion reconstruction efficiency in au+au collisions with different multiplicities as a function of the transverse momentum of the primary particle@xcite . in high multiplicity events it reaches a plateau of 80% for high @xmath8 particles .",
    "below 300 mev / c the efficiency drops rapidly because the primary particles spiral up inside the tpc and do nt reach the outer field cage . in addition , these low momentum particles interact with the beam pipe and the inner field cage before entering the tracking volume of the tpc . as a function of mulitplicity , the efficiency goes up to the geometrical limit , minus software cuts , for low multiplicity events .     were used to generate the figure and the magnetic field was set to 0.25 t. the data are binned by centrality .",
    "the most central collisions are the the highest multiplicity data and they are shown as black dots .",
    "the lowest multiplicity data are shown as open triangles.,width=529 ]      the primary vertex can used to improve the momentum resolution of the tracks and the secondary vertices can be separated from the primary vertices if the vertex resolution is good enough .",
    "many of the strange particles produced in heavy ion collisions can be identified this way .",
    "the primary vertex is found by considering all of the tracks reconstructed in the tpc and then extrapolating them back to the origin .",
    "the global average is the vertex position .",
    "the primary vertex resolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fvertex ] .",
    "it is calculated by comparing the position of the vertices that are reconstructed using each side of the tpc , separately . as expected , the resolution decreases as the square root of the number of tracks used in the calculation .",
    "a resolution of 350 @xmath5 m is achieved when there are more than 1,000 tracks .",
    "the transverse momentum , @xmath8 , of a track is determined by fitting a circle through the @xmath6 , @xmath9 coordinates of the vertex and the points along the track .",
    "the total momentum is calculated using this radius of curvature and the angle that the track makes with respect to the @xmath7 axis of the tpc .",
    "this procedure works for all primary particles coming from the vertex , but for secondary decays , such as @xmath10 or @xmath11 , the circle fit must be done without reference to the primary vertex .    in order to estimate the momentum resolution we use the embedding technique discussed above .",
    "the track simulator was used to create a track with a known momentum .",
    "the track was then embedded in a real event in order to simulate the momentum smearing effects of working in a high track density environment .",
    "figure [ fresolution ] shows the @xmath8 resolution for @xmath12 and anti - protons in star .",
    "the figure shows two regimes : at low momentum , where multiple coulomb scattering dominates ( i.e. @xmath13 for pions , and @xmath14 mev / c for anti - protons ) , and at higher momentum where the momentum resolution is limited by the strength of the magnet field and the tpc spatial resolution .",
    "the best relative momentum resolution falls between these two extremes and it is 2% for pions .     and anti - protons in the 0.25 t magnetic field .",
    "tracks are required to be formed by more than 15 hits .",
    "tracks are embedded in minimum bias events .",
    "the momentum resolution is calculated as the gaussian @xmath15.,width=529 ]      energy lost in the tpc gas is a valuable tool for identifying particle species .",
    "it works especially well for low momentum particles but as the particle energy rises , the energy loss becomes less mass - dependent and it is hard to separate particles with velocities @xmath16c .",
    "star was designed to be able to separate pions and protons up to 1.2 gev / c .",
    "this requires a relative @xmath2 resolution of 7% .",
    "the challenge , then , is to calibrate the tpc and understand the signal and gain variations well enough to be able to achieve this goal .",
    "the measured @xmath2 resolution depends on the gas gain which itself depends on the pressure in the tpc .",
    "since the tpc is kept at a constant 2 mbar above atmospheric pressure , the tpc pressure varies with time .",
    "we monitor the gas gain with a wire chamber that operates in the tpc gas return line .",
    "it measures the gain from an @xmath17fe source .",
    "it will be used to calibrate the 2001 data , but for the 2000 run , this chamber was not installed and so we monitored the gain by averaging the signal for tracks over the entire volume of the detector and we have done a relative calibration on each sector based on the global average .",
    "local gas gain variations are calibrated by calculating the average signal measured on one row of pads on the pad - plane and assuming that all pad - rows measure the same signal .",
    "the correction is done on the pad - row level because the anode wires lie on top of , and run the full length of , the pad - rows .",
    "the read - out electronics also introduce uncertainties in the @xmath2 signals .",
    "there are small variations between pads , and groups of pads , due to the different response of each readout board .",
    "these variations are monitored by pulsing the ground plane of the anode and pad plane read - out system and then assuming that the response will be the same on every pad .",
    "the @xmath2 is extracted from the energy loss measured on up to 45 padrows .",
    "the length over which the particle energy loss is measured ( pad length modulo the crossing and dip angles ) is too short to average out ionizations fluctuations .",
    "indeed , particles lose energy going through the gas in frequent collisions with atoms where a few tens of ev are released , as well as , rare collisions where hundreds of ev are released  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not possible to accurately measure the average @xmath2 .",
    "instead , the most probable energy loss is measured .",
    "we do this by removing the largest ionization clusters .",
    "the truncated mean , where a given fraction ( typically 30% ) of the clusters having the largest signal are removed , is an efficient tool to measure the most probable @xmath2 .",
    "however , fitting the @xmath2 distribution including all clusters associated with a given track was found to be more effective .",
    "it also allows us to account for the variation of the most probable energy loss with the length of the ionization samples ( @xmath18 )  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fdedx ] shows the energy loss for particles in the tpc as a function of the particle momentum .",
    "the data have been corrected for signal and gain variations and the data are plotted using a 70% truncated mean .",
    "the magnetic field setting is 0.25 t. the resolution is 8% for a track that crosses 40 pad - rows . at 0.5 t ,",
    "the @xmath2 resolution improves because the transverse diffusion is smaller and this improves the signal to noise ratio for each cluster .",
    "figure [ fdedx ] includes both primary and secondary particles .",
    "the prominent proton , deuteron , and muon bands come from secondary interactions in the beam pipe and ifc , and from pion and kaon decays .",
    "pions and protons can be separated from each other up to 1 gev / c .     of the primary particle .",
    "the magnetic field was 0.25 t.,width=529 ]",
    "the star tpc is up and running at rhic .",
    "the detector finished its second year of operation on january 25th , 2002 and the operation of the tpc was stable and reliable throughout both run cycles .",
    "its performance is very close to the original design requirements in terms of tracking efficiency , momentum resolution , and energy loss measurements .",
    "many results from the 2000/2001 data have already been published and they demonstrate that the physics at rhic is exciting and rich .",
    "we invite you to examine these papers@xcite .",
