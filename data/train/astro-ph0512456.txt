    "structure in the neutral and ionized interstellar gas of the milky way is ubiquitous and present on many scales .",
    "there have been many observational , theoretical , and computational papers concerning turbulence in the neutral gas and molecular clouds , but relatively little is known about the structure of the warm ionized gas component ( see elmegreen & scalo 2004 , scalo & elmegreen 2004 for an overview ) .",
    "turbulence in the ionized gas is suggested by observations of non - thermal linewidths in h@xmath2 @xcite , and modeled in numerical simulations of the multiphase ism ( see vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein ) . furthermore , observed power spectra or structure functions of electron density show power law behavior indicative of incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence ( cordes et al.1985 , armstrong et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , care should be taken in interpretation of these density spectra , as the connection between density and velocity structure is not unambiguous , and fluctuations in electron density can be created by a number of different processes such as small - amplitude plasma waves or differences in ionization fraction .",
    "the observed density fluctuations in the ionized ism in the galactic plane differ from those in the halo .",
    "the plane shows enhanced scattering of extragalactic radio sources ( spangler & reynolds 1990 ) , higher rotation measures ( rms ) from extragalactic sources ( e.g.  clegg et al .",
    "1992 ) , and increased scintillation of pulsars and angular broadening of extragalactic sources ( e.g.  cordes et al.1985 ) . although fluctuations on scales of hundreds of parsecs have been observed out of the galactic plane ( e.g.  armstrong et al.1995 ) , the gas in the plane may be partly dominated by structures on much smaller scales ( haverkorn et al .",
    "internal structure in individual h  ii regions in the galactic plane may be responsible for these enhanced fluctuations in the ionized ism ( spangler & reynolds 1990 , haverkorn et al .  2004 ) .",
    "these previous studies have considered how the properties of fluctuations in the ism vary with galactic latitude . in this _",
    "letter _ , we examine structure in the thermal electron density and magnetic field in the warm ionized ism as a function of longitude , to detect any change in characteristics between spiral arms and interarm regions .",
    "the sgps is a radio survey in the h  i line and in 1.4  ghz polarized continuum covering the ranges @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 at @xmath6 resolution , observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes 64 m radio telescope ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2005 ; haverkorn et al .",
    "the polarized continuum has been observed only with the atca , in twelve 8  mhz - wide frequency bands from 1336  mhz to 1432  mhz ( where the 1408  mhz band is omitted due to radio interference ) .",
    "this enables determination of rms both from diffuse galactic synchrotron emission ( gaensler et al .",
    "2001 ) , and from unresolved polarized extragalactic point sources , discussed here .",
    "rms of polarized point sources in the range @xmath7 have been determined using the technique explained in brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; a full analysis of these sources will be given elsewhere .",
    "rms were determined for 151 sources , the distribution of which can be approximated by a gaussian centered on + 60  rad  m@xmath8  with a standard deviation of 233  rad  m@xmath8 .",
    "the second order structure function , sf@xmath9 , of a function @xmath10 as a function of scale @xmath11 is defined as sf@xmath12 ^ 2 \\rangle_x$ ] , where @xmath13 denotes averaging over all positions @xmath14 .",
    "we determined sfs of rm for five regions at different galactic longitudes , selected so that the major part of the probed sight line traced either spiral arms or interarm regions .",
    "sfs were averaged azimuthally to obtain a 1d sf as a function of angular scale @xmath15 .",
    "because a large - scale gradient in the field will show up as a positive slope in the sf , care has to be taken to correct for any large - scale gradients .",
    "visual inspection of the data did not show any clear gradients , and a first order correction was made by subtracting a best - fit gradient from the rm data before evaluating the structure function .",
    "the displayed errors are propagated errors in the rm values .",
    "these errors are derived from the linear fit of polarization angle with wavelength squared , and based on signal - to - noise ratios in stokes @xmath16 and @xmath17 . assuming the distribution is homogeneous and isotropic , the effect of noise in the structure function can be corrected for . if the observed rm is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the noise contribution , the sf of rm corrected for noise is @xmath20 ( haverkorn et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "[ f : sfrm ] shows the sf of rm as a function of angular scale @xmath15 for five regions in the sgps .",
    "these were the regions with the least confusion between spiral arms and interarm regions along the line of sight .",
    "the top three plots , with galactic longitude range as denoted in the figure , are at sight lines predominantly through interarm regions , while the bottom two plots show sfs of rms mostly in spiral arms .",
    "the galactic latitude range of all regions is the latitude range of the sgps , i.e.  @xmath21 .",
    "the behavior of the sf is different at the positions of the spiral arms , indicating that the structure in rm changes in the arms . in the interarm regions",
    "the sfs display a power law of rm fluctuations , whereas the sf slopes in the spiral arms are consistent with zero .",
    "the sfs in the interarm regions saturate at the maximum at which flutuations exist , called the outer scale ( or integral scale )",
    ".    the sf slopes @xmath22 ( sf@xmath23 ) for the three interarm regions are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with a weighted mean @xmath26 .",
    "the probability that the spiral arm points are consistent with @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "the standard deviation of rm seems to be higher in the spiral arms as well : the standard deviation of rm in the interarm regions is @xmath29  rad  m@xmath8 , and the probability that the standard deviations of rm in the selected spiral arm regions ( @xmath30 and @xmath31  rad  m@xmath8respectively ) are equal to @xmath32 is  0.07 .",
    "an independent determination of the fluctuations in thermal electron density @xmath33 can be attempted using h@xmath2 observations to obtain emission measures em ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the path length through the ionized gas ) .",
    "however , h@xmath2 data suffer from high and variable extinction in the galactic plane , which introduces additional power in the sf .",
    "instead , we try an alternative method using dispersion measures dm ( @xmath36 ) of pulsars , which do not suffer from extinction .",
    "since pulsars are located inside the galaxy , the path length over which dm is calculated is smaller than the path length of the rm measurements towards extragalactic sources .",
    "however , since the approximate distances to the pulsars are known , we can select a sample of pulsars sufficiently far away that their path length is predominantly through spiral arms or through interarm regions .",
    "furthermore , we consider pulsars at approximately the same distances , so that their spatial separation on the sky scales linearly with their angular separation .",
    "pulsars were selected from the atnf pulsar catalogue ( manchester et al .",
    "we found 41 pulsars in the sgps region with distances @xmath37 in the range @xmath38  kpc using the dm values in the catalog combined with the ne2001 model ( cordes & lazio 2003 ) . errors in ne2001 are assumed to be mainly on small scales , so that the uncertainty in the estimated pulsar distance is independent of spatial scale . as a result , the error in the distance will increase the amplitude of the sf , but not influence its scale .",
    "unfortunately the number of pulsars in each selected region was so low that the sf of dm could be determined reliably only in the region at @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sfrm ] as asterisks .",
    "although inconclusive in itself , the dm data confirm that sfs rise in an interarm region .",
    "we have shown that in the galactic spiral arms no correlated fluctuations exist in the magnetized interstellar plasma on scales larger than @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath1  pc in the nearest spiral arm probed , i.e.  the carina arm which starts at @xmath41  kpc distance in this direction @xcite . in the interarm regions , however , correlated magnetoionic fluctuations _ are _ present on large scales . since the rm is a line of sight average through the entire galaxy , it is not possible to associate a spatial scale to this angular scale . but assuming that the largest angular scales represent nearby structure at a fairly arbitrary distance of @xmath42  kpc away , an outer scale of @xmath43 in the interarm regions would correspond to a spatial scale of about 100  pc .",
    "the measured slopes of rm sfs in the interarm regions roughly agree with slopes of _ velocity _ structure functions in simulations of incompressible ( magneto- ) hydrodynamical turbulence @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the density and velocity spectra may be coupled , which is only the case for subsonic or mildly supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the rm fluctuations are connected to velocity structure , the turbulence in the interarm ionized gas must be subsonic or only mildly supersonic , in agreement with observational results from h@xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the rm structure observed in spiral arms is probably _ not _ a part of the turbulent cascade in the diffuse ionized medium .",
    "if the density spectrum traces the velocity spectrum , this would mean that the outer scale of turbulence would be @xmath44  pc .",
    "however , the dominant source of turbulent driving is believed to be supernova remnants and superbubbles , injecting energy on much larger scales @xcite .    a shallow rm sf can also be caused by highly supersonic compressible turbulence , which will flatten the density sf @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned before , it is doubtful whether the ionized gas in the spiral arms is very supersonic .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations in rm in the spiral arms are probably not connected to the turbulent cascade in the diffuse ionized ism at all . instead , a probable source of these fluctuations is regions , which are of the correct size , sufficiently abundant @xcite and concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "widespread interstellar turbulence injected by regions is not expected to be significant @xcite , but the structure could be caused by the regions themselves , or by turbulence inside them .",
    "the authors would like to thank mordecai mac low , alex lazarian and dick crutcher for stimulating discussions , and the referee john scalo for valuable comments .",
