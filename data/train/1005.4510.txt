    "quantum entanglement , as a kind of distinctive quantum correlation without the classical counterpart , is widely recognized as the crucial resource of quantum communication and computation @xcite . however , there are also other nonclassical correlations that can even exist in separated quantum states @xcite .",
    "the finding that nonclassical correlations other than quantum entanglement may provide the speedup in the deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit ( dqc1 ) protocol @xcite has greatly motivated the related study .",
    "one of the essential issues is to distinguish different kinds of correlations in quantum systems . in the classical information theory ,",
    "correlation is perfectly characterized by the shannon entropy , which is represented by the classical mutual information @xcite . when it comes to quantum systems ,",
    "the shannon entropy is replaced by the von neumann entropy and the total correlation in a bipartite system is characterized by the quantum mutual information @xcite . for bipartite systems ,",
    "the quantumness of correlation can be quantified by the quantum discord which represents the difference between classical information theory and quantum information theory @xcite . a related method concerning classical correlation",
    "is proposed and it is based on the maximal information one can extract with a one - sided local measurement @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that almost all quantum states contains non - vanishing quantum discord that is composed by the quantum entanglement and non - entanglement quantum correlation @xcite .",
    "there are many investigations of quantum correlation measured by quantum discord in different kinds of physical systems , including the spin chains @xcite , jaynes - cummings systems @xcite , spin - boson systems @xcite , optical systems @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and nmr systems @xcite .",
    "recently , this kind of measurement is also extended to continuous variable systems @xcite and even the quantum biology systems @xcite .",
    "quantum discord has been found to be useful in quantum information processing and quantum information theory .",
    "the non - entanglement quantum discord may provide the quantum advantage in the dqc1 quantum computation protocol @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of quantum discord implies completely positive dynamics maps @xcite .",
    "quantum discord also plays important roles in many basic physical problems , for example the maxwell s demon @xcite , quantum phase transition @xcite and the relative effect @xcite .",
    "the quantification of quantum discord is based on the one - sided measurement on a bipartite system , which is usually asymmetric .",
    "we would get different results by choosing different subsystem to be measured .",
    "a symmetrical method with two - sided measurement over both partitions of a bipartite system is proposed to quantify the classical correlation which is represented by the maximal classical mutual information @xcite .",
    "there are also other approaches proposed to distinguish classical and quantum correlations .",
    "inspired by the work consumption when extracting information from a heat bath , a thermodynamics approach is used to defined quantum correlation in quantum systems @xcite . in",
    "particularly , the difference between the extractable information with the closed local operation and classical communication and the total information is defined as the quantum information deficit , which is used to quantify quantum correlation @xcite . because classical states are measured without disturbance , classical and quantum correlations are also characterized by the measurement - induced disturbance @xcite . recently , by employing the relative entropy as a distance measure of correlations , the method proposed by modi _",
    "@xcite provides an unified view of quantum and classical correlations .",
    "different from quantum discord based on bipartite mutual information , this method can be extended to quantified different kinds of correlations in multipartite systems of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "generally , all these measurements of classical and quantum correlations mentioned above are not equal to each other due to the different definitions .",
    "however , they are consistent in the case of distinguishing classical and quantum correlations in bell diagonal states @xcite",
    ".    another interesting subject is to investigate the dynamics of different kinds of correlations in noisy environments .",
    "for one side , the inevitable interaction between a quantum system and its environment would destroy correlations in the system and leads to the reduction of useful resource .",
    "the knowledge of the dynamic behavior of correlations will help us to design suitable protocols to protect correlations under processing .",
    "for the other side , stimulated by the discovery of distinctive dynamic behavior of entanglement sudden death @xcite , that is , entanglement disappear completely in a finite evolution time , the investigation of the unusual dynamic behavior of classical and quantum correlations has caused great interests .",
    "usually , the dissipative correlation evolution is essentially dependent on the types of noises that act on the system .",
    "markovian noises would cause the irreversible decay of system information into the environment .",
    "it has been shown that quantum discord is more robust than entanglement under markovian noises @xcite , in the sense that entanglement may suffer from sudden death , whereas quantum correlation decays exponentially .",
    "the sudden change in behavior in the decay rates of classical and quantum correlations has been predicted in different kinds of markovian environments @xcite and has been experimentally verified in an optical system @xcite . the decoherence - free evolution of quantum and classical correlations under certain markovian noise and the sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime",
    "are also observed @xcite .",
    "the markovian dynamics of classical and quantum correlations is also experimentally investigated in a nuclear magnetic resonance quadrupolar system @xcite .",
    "when it is extended to the non - markovian environment with memory effect , the feedback information from the environment to the interested system may greatly affect the dynamic behavior of correlations .",
    "quantum discord under non - markovian noises is shown to be instantaneously vanished compared to the completely disappearance of entanglement in a finite time interval @xcite .",
    "the revival of quantum discord without the revival of entanglement is also demonstrated in non - markovian noises @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "based on the equal footing method with the relative entropy as a distance measurement of correlations , we experimentally investigate the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations of a two - photon bell diagonal state in a one - sided non - markovian environment , which is simulated by a fabry - perot cavity followed by quartz plates . at the beginning of evolution ,",
    "the sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime is shown @xcite . due to the refocusing effect of the relative phase in the non - markovian environment",
    ", the quantum correlation revives from a near zero area and then decays again in the subsequent evolution .",
    "however , the non - markovian effect is too weak to revive the classical correlation , which remains constant at the same evolution range .",
    "we then perform a @xmath1 operation on the photon under decoherence and the sudden transition from quantum to classical revival regime is obtained , in which correlation echoes are formed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the measure of correlations using relative entropy and the theoretical description of the experiment are given in section ii .",

    "the magnitude of a specified property in a quantum system can be quantified by the distance from the interested state to the closest state without that desired property @xcite .",
    "for example , quantum entanglement can be characterized by the relative entropy of entanglement ( @xmath2 ) @xcite , which is described as the minimal distance measured with relative entropy between the state @xmath3 and a separated state @xmath4 and is expressed as @xmath5 .",

    "the total mutual information of @xmath3 can be calculated as @xmath18 which represents the minimal distance between @xmath3 and its reduced state in the product form @xmath19 @xcite . for bipartite systems",
    ", @xmath20 is equal to the quantum mutual information .",

    "we can therefore calculate the quantum correlation @xmath27 according to equation ( [ quantum ] ) .",

    "this implies that the dephasing effect between @xmath35 and @xmath36 caused by q2 is completely compensated by q3 and all the correlations maximally revives to the initial values . during this process , the sudden transition from quantum to classical revival area",

    "the reasons for quantum advantage in quantum information processing are still controversial @xcite .",
    "recently , a simple one - to - one relationship between bipartite entanglement of formation @xcite and quantum discord in a general tripartite system is proposed @xcite . by taking the environment which is initially maximally entangled to the system with the reduced maximally mixed state in the dqc1 protocol into consideration",
    ", it is suggested that both the quantum discord and entanglement are responsible for the quantum computer speedup @xcite .",
    "inspired by the factorization law of entanglement evolution in noisy quantum channels @xcite , it is expected that similar simple relationship for quantum correlation under noise environment exists . with the increasing interests , there will be more distinctive discoveries in this field .    in our experiment",
    ", we have investigated the correlation dynamics in a non - markovian dephasing environment .",
    "the whole point of a non - markovian environment is that it retains a memory of a system at a given time and then later passes this information back into the system in some form or another . in this experiment",
    ", the non - markovian environment acts via the fp cavity followed by quartz plates on the biphoton system of only one of the photons .",
    "due to the discrete frequency distribution of the photon which leads to the refocusing of the relative phase in the dephasing environment , the non - markovian effect occurs and the revival of quantum correlation is obtained from near zero area .",
    "however , the non - markovian effect is too weak to revive the classical correlation . with the narrower fwhm of the wave packets of the discrete frequency distribution ,",
    "the revival of classical correlation would be also achieved . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fwhm of the wave packets become lager , the non - markovian effect becomes weaker .",
    "when the discrete frequency distribution tends to continuous gaussian distribution , we would get the markovian limited dynamics .",
    "we further implement a @xmath0 operation on the photon in path @xmath38 to investigate the corresponding correlation dynamics . during this process ,",
    "we obtain correlation echoes , in which the sudden transition from quantum to classical revival regime is observed .",
    "this work is a useful and informative add - on to our previous works , in which the entanglement collapse and revival is observed @xcite and the markovian limited dynamics of correlations is demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the method can be used to control the revival time of correlations , which would find important applications in quantum memory .",
