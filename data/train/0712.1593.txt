    ", we predict about 8 lensed quasars , much closer to the observed numbers of lensed quasars .",

    "[ sec : lens_properties ] show that the increase is partly due to a significant enhancement of the strong - lensing cross - section of group and cluster halos with virial masses @xmath178 .",
    "in addition , the stellar matter leads to significant strong lensing in smaller halos , which would not cause noticeable strong lensing otherwise .",
    "although these halos have typical einstein radii @xmath109 , their large abundance outweighs their small individual cross - sections , leading to a bimodal distribution of integrated cross - sections with halo mass both for strongly distorted images and for multiply imaged sources at redshifts @xmath179 .    in sec .",

    ". although the optical depths for lensing by both the dark and luminous matter are much larger than for lensing by dark matter alone for images at radii @xmath119 , for images at larger radii the optical depths are much more similar . for images at radii @xmath128 , the optical depths differ by at most a factor of two . for radii @xmath1 , there is almost no enhancement due to the galaxies , in agreement with earlier studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results are consistent with the observed radial distribution of multiply imaged quasars with splittings @xmath139 in the recent sdss quasar sample of @xcite _ only _ if the effect of the galaxies is taken into account .",
    "the total number of lensed quasars predicted by our standard model is still quite low compared to the number observed , indicating a need to include the effects of baryonic dissipation on the dark matter distribution in order to explain the data fully .",
    "an obvious extension to the work presented here will be ray - tracing over finite fields to study the effects of lensing on sources with finite extent . with a realistic distribution of source properties ,",

    "in future work , the morphology and luminosity information could be added to simulate galaxy - galaxy lensing surveys with given selection functions .",
