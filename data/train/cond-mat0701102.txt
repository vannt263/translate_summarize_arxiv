    "no structures close to the pinch - off regime are observed . as the localization of the mb or the number of occupied modes",
    "is increased , the number of conductance zeroes increases as well . here , however , we focus on the simplest scenario where just one resonance is present .",
    "this is the reason why we study qwrs with at most four occupied modes .    to shed some light on the origin of the structures in the conductance",
    ", we study the local density of states ( ldos ) , integrated along the _ y_-direction , as a function of _ x _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . for smooth mbs ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) , the mb generates an _",
    "x_-dependent diamagnetic shift of the qwr modes , which are connected throughout the barrier structure . as the fermi energy",
    "is lowered , barriers are formed for modes with subsequently lower energy , and again a stepwise decrease of @xmath84 without resonances results .",
    "+ as the barrier is localized further , fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the modes segregate and localized states form at the center of the barrier , which can be regarded as remnants of the magnetoelectric subbands .",
    "qualitatively , we can understand this as follows . in sufficiently strong magnetic field gradients , the magnetic phase changes abruptly in _",
    "x_-direction , and pronounced reflections occur which localize the mode inside the barrier .",
    "these localized states may align in energy with the qwr modes of a higher index and a _ resonant reflection _ scenario results .",
    "the formation of localized states at the center of the mb is similar to the case of the double - barrier resonant tunneling ( dbrt ) structures , where transmission resonances are related to the existence of the quasibound states between two barriers .",
    "however , the present mechanism has a different phenomenology than dbrt : ( i ) in dbrt , the resonance transmission probability equals 1 for a symmetric structure . in our system ,",
    "the transmission peak is much smaller than 1 .",
    "( ii ) dbrt structures do not possess transmission zeroes . in our sstem",
    ", however , the dip in the conductance between the transmission peak and the first plateau equals zero within numerical accuracy . as the strength of the magnetic barrier increases , the height of the peak increases , but the transmission minimum remains at zero .",
    "( iii ) for dbrt , the transmission resonances coincide with the quasi - bound states in energy and correspond to the poles in the complex - energy plane @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) ( energy _ b _ ) , the maximum in the ldos is at a different energy than the conductance peak .",
    "rather , the peak position is at the low energy tail of the bound state .",
    "this phenomenology is the same as that one found in wave guides with resonators attached @xcite .",
    "following shao s discussion @xcite , the resonator contributes a phase factor @xmath85 and the transmission amplitude from left to right can be expressed as    @xmath86    with the transmission amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 for being scattered into ( from the left ) and out ( to the right ) of the resonator and @xmath89 the factor from each reflection back into the resonator , and @xmath90 denotes the direct transmission path without a detour into the resonator . according to eq .",
    ", the transmission amplitude can vanish if both a direct and an indirect transmission channel via the resonator are present and interfere with each other .",
    "this behavior corresponds to a fano resonance @xcite , which is also found in systems related to ours @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we argue that this scenario does exist in a magnetic barrier under certain circumstances .",
    "the direct transmission channel is formed by an extended state which resembles an edge state in the region of high magnetic fields , while the bound state is a vortex state that forms near the center of the magnetic barrier .",
    "the character of such states is thus markedly different from snake - orbit states known from magnetic field steps with a change in polarity @xcite .    to further illustrate this effect ,",
    "we have studied the spatially resolved probability density and the current density distribution emerging from the two occupied wave functions at the fermi level close to the reflection resonance , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the sum of the probability densities @xmath91 of the two wave functions ( belonging to the first and second energy level of the quantum wire ) as well as the corresponding current density distributions are plotted as a function of the lateral coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 for energies _ a_-_d_. in the pinch - off regime at energies below the transmission resonance ( for example at energy @xmath92 , energy _ a _ ) , the region of high probability density inside the barrier is well separated in space from those in the leads .",
    "in addition , the probability of finding the electrons close to the barrier maximum is small .",
    "correspondingly , the current density gets reflected at the flank of the barrier .",
    "as the energy is increased into the transmission peak ( energy _ b _ ) , the region of high probability density moves along the _",
    "x_-direction into the barrier , and a significant probability density is found even at the barrier maximum . at the same time",
    ", the probability density remains asymmetric about the center of the qwr in y - direction . translated into a current density distribution ,",
    "this means that inside the transmission peak , a current path evolves where the electrons enter the barrier region at the upper edge of the qwr , and while a large part of the electrons gets rejected , a significant fraction is transmitted , via the lower half of the qwr , to the right hand side . at the reflection resonance ( energy _ c _ ) , the region of high probability density is pushed even further into the barrier region , but at the same time develops a strongly symmetric shape about the center of the qwr cross section .",
    "this means that all the current flowing into the barrier gets reflected back into the qwr . at higher energies ,",
    "the open regime is reached , like at energy _",
    "d_. it can be distinguished from the closed regime by the fact that a high probability density inside the barrier remains at only one edge of the qwr , which at the same time extends across the whole barrier structure in x - direction .",
    "this structure provides a strong transmission channel for the electrons , with the current flowing predominantly at the lower right edge across the magnetic barrier .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the formation of a local edge state inside the magnetic barrier .",
    "+ based on these findings , we interpret the resonances in the conductance as follows : close to the pinch - off regime , i.e. around @xmath93 for @xmath94 in our model calculations , there is still a small but non - vanishing direct transmission probability through the magnetic barrier .",
    "this can be inferred from comparing the width of the transition region between the conductance plateaus 1 and 2 , which is roughly 2.5 @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding extended state has the character on an edge state in the magnetic barrier . according to eq .",
    ", it interferes with the indirect transmission amplitude via the vortex - type bound state present in the magnetic barrier and generates a reflection resonance .    .",
    "the magnetization of the ferromagnetic film is @xmath96 , and the distance @xmath13 of the qwr from the surface is @xmath81 .",
    "note that the parameters without disorder are identical to those in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ]",
    "we proceed by discussing the effects of disorder on the transmission properties . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the conductance around the reflection resonance is shown on a logarithmic scale as a function of the energy for various degrees of disorder .",
    "the disorder potential is modelled by a disorder @xmath44 of the site energy .",
    "a critical disorder energy of @xmath97 is observed . for lower disorder ,",
    "the reflection resonance remains basically unaffected . at larger values for the disorder energy ,",
    "the transmission at the resonance becomes nonzero , while the minimum in the conductance shifts towards larger energies . at @xmath98 ,",
    "the reflection resonance is no longer a characteristic property of the structure , while further resonances are of comparable strength .",
    "these resonances have their origin in interferences due to multiple reflections between impurities .",
    "we emphasize that while the specific disorder configuration at fixed @xmath99 determines details of the energy - dependent conductance , it does only marginally influence the position , the minimum conductance or the width of the reflection resonance .",
    "the conductance of quantum wires containing a magnetic barrier has been studied by the recursive greens function technique .",
    "it is found that for sufficiently large ratios of @xmath100 , the barrier `` closes '' and the transmission drop to zero . at energies close to the magnetic pinch - off ,",
    "reflection resonances are observed for sufficiently localized magnetic barriers .",
    "the resonances have their origin in an interference between quasi - bound states residing inside the magnetic barrier and propagating states of the qwr which , at the magnetic barrier , have the character of edge states . even without taking the spin explicitly into account ,",
    "it becomes clear that due to the resonance condition , particularly large spin polarizations can be expected around the resonances , the sign of which should be adjustable by a small change of the sample parameters .",
    "more studies are necessary to analyze the details of the spin effects in such resonances .",
