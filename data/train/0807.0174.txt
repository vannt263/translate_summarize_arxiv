    "since loops and legs 2006 @xcite , considerable progress in the determination of the virtual nnlo corrections to the massive qed bhabha process has been made .",
    "the @xmath0 two - loop corrections with heavy - fermion insertions have been computed in the limit @xmath1 : with a direct feynman diagram calculation in @xcite , and using a factorization formula that relates massless and massive amplitudes in @xcite .",
    "hadronic contributions have been recently calculated in @xcite .",
    "in addition , heavy - fermion corrections , beyond the @xmath2 limit , have been made available in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the original expectations on the necessity of a complete , direct two - loop massive feynman diagram evaluation have not been fulfilled yet .",
    "after the analytical evaluation of a massive planar and a massive non - planar double - box diagram ( both with seven propagators ) in @xcite and in @xcite , there was hope to evaluate all the remaining diagrams soon @xcite .",
    "so far only part of the photonic master integrals , namely the planar ones , have been evaluated in @xcite in the limit of small electron mass .",
    "although this limit is by far sufficient for experiments , there is still space for theoretical developments .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that results for three gauge - invariant classes of nnlo feynman diagrams have been determined by at least two independent groups , relying on different methods :    * _ photonic corrections : _ computed in @xcite and recalculated in @xcite ; * _ electron @xmath3 corrections : _ computed in @xcite and cross - checked in @xcite ( with full @xmath4 dependence ) and in @xcite ( small electron mass limit ) ; * _ heavy - fermion @xmath0 contributions : _ determined with two independent methods in the limit @xmath2 in @xcite and for any mass @xmath5 in @xcite ( dispersive approach ) and in @xcite ( analytical result )",
    ".    as far as the full electroweak model is concerned , the nlo corrections are well known @xcite . at nnlo ,",
    "the terms enhanced by the heavy top quark are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the full dependence of weak corrections on the top quark and higgs boson masses is known @xcite and implemented for fermion pair production in @xmath6-annihilation @xcite , but is not yet implemented for bhabha scattering . here",
    ", we report on another class of nnlo corrections , which have recently determined :    * _ virtual hadronic nnlo contributions _ , including both reducible self - energy insertions and irreducible vertex and box corrections @xcite .    for a review on the status of monte carlo studies for bhabha scattering",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "higher order hadronic corrections to the bhabha scattering cross section can be obtained inserting the renormalized irreducible photon vacuum polarization function , @xmath7 , in the appropriate virtual - photon propagator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the momentum carried by the virtual photon and @xmath10 .",
    "the vacuum polarization function @xmath7 can be represented by the once - subtracted dispersion integral @xcite , @xmath11 where the production threshold for the intermediate state in @xmath7 is located at @xmath12 .",
    "we leave as understood the subtraction at @xmath13 for the renormalized photon self - energy .",
    "light - quark contributions get modified by low - energy strong - interaction effects , which can not be computed using perturbative qcd .",
    "however , these contributions can be evaluated using the optical theorem  @xcite , and relating @xmath14 to the hadronic cross - section ratio @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath16 @xmath17 can be computed employing the experimental data for @xmath15 in the low - energy region and around hadronic resonances , and the perturbative - qcd prediction in the remaining regions .",
    "here we give numerical results through tables which have been included also in the first version of @xcite .",
    "a shape of the @xmath18 parameterization we use is given in fig .",
    "[ frhad ] . in a forthcoming publication @xcite , containing a detailed description of @xcite , we will employ a more updated parameterization of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we just mention that the final numbers get modified only slightly and do not change qualitatively the situation .    , based on the parameterization given in @xcite . _",
    "_ ]    the lower integration boundary in eq",
    ".   is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the pion mass .",
    "for self - energy corrections to bhabha scattering at one - loop order this method was first employed in @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that contributions to @xmath7 arising from leptons and the top quark can be computed directly in perturbation theory , setting @xmath21 in eq .  , where @xmath5 is the mass of the fermion appearing in the loop , and inserting the imaginary part of the analytic result for @xmath7 .",
    "in the following , we will not consider hadronic effects to the running of the coupling constant ; details can be found in @xcite .",
    "hadronic irreducible vertex corrections are obtained through the interference of the vertex diagrams of figure  [ fig1 ] with the tree - level amplitude .",
    "their contribution to the @xmath22 differential cross section is given by : @xmath23   \\bigl\\ } + { \\cal o}(m_e^2 ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . here",

    "heavy - fermion and hadronic contributions , instead , can be evaluated as in ref .",
    "@xcite through the dispersion integral @xmath29 where @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 and where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the color factor and the electric charge .",
