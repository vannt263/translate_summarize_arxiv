    "large - scale large - amplitude waves and shocks in the solar corona occur in association with flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "the existence of flare - related global disturbances has been first inferred from moreton waves @xcite , which appear as arc - like fronts in chromospheric h@xmath0 filtergrams , moving away from the ignition site with typical velocities of 5001000  km / s .",
    "it was soon recognized that moreton waves could not be propagating in the chromosphere , where no wave mode has such high velocity ( e.g.  sound speed and alfvn speed are only of the order of tens of km / s ) .",
    "the first interpretation was by @xcite that moreton waves are the surface - track of a coronal fast - mode magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave front .",
    "the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) for the first time directly imaged propagating global disturbances in the corona , and these so - called `` eit waves '' were assumed to be the coronal counterparts of the moreton waves @xcite . thereafter , coronal waves were found to be a quite frequent phenomenon , and it became an intense matter of debate whether eit waves :    * are really the coronal counterparts of moreton waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , there might be different types of eit waves , further complicating this debate . for detailed discussions we refer to the recent reviews by @xcite .",
    "one important limitation of coronal wave studies so far is the low cadence of the eit instrument ( 1215  min ) , which makes it impossible to study wave kinematics beyond a rough velocity estimate . observations of large - scale waves in trace euv images are rare due to its limited field of view , but we note that one such event was observed with high cadence and studied in detail in @xcite . the extreme ultraviolet imagers ( euvi ) on the recent solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) spacecraft regularly perform euv full - disk imaging with a cadence as good as 2.5  min . in this letter , we study for the first time the dynamical evolution of a globally propagating  eit \" wave in high - cadence euvi images .",
    "euvi is part of the sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument suite onboard stereo @xcite .",
    "stereo consists of two identical spacecraft , which orbit the sun ahead and behind the earth near the ecliptic plane .",
    "euvi is observing the chromosphere and low corona in four euv bandpasses ( he  ii 304   , fe  ix 171   , fe  xii 195   , fe  xv 284   ) out to 1.7@xmath1 ( with @xmath1 the solar radius ) with a pixel limited spatial resolution of 1.6@xmath2/pixel . during the event under study , the euvi imaging cadence was 2.5 min in the 171   and 10 min in the 195   filter .",
    "the impulsive phase of the associated b9.5/sf flare was fully captured in hard x - rays by the ramaty high energy spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the study of associated cmes , we use data from the stereo / secchi inner coronagraph cor1 , which has a field - of - view ( fov ) from 1.4 to 4@xmath1 @xcite , and from the large angle spectroscopic coronagraph ( lasco ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard soho .",
    "the coronal wave under study occurred on 19 may 2007 during @xmath312:5013:20  ut , in association with the weak b9.5 flare / cme event in ar 10956 close to sun center ( n01@xmath4,w05@xmath4 ) .",
    "the two stereo spacecraft were 8.6@xmath5 apart and both observed the wave .",
    "we concentrate on stereo - a observations , since it observed a larger portion of the western solar hemisphere , into which the wave propagated . for comparison of stereo - a images with other space - borne and ground - based data",
    ", we rescaled the image sizes to earth distance . on 19 may 2007 , stereo - a was at a distance of 0.96  au from sun , and earth was at 1.01  au",
    "thus , we decreased the angular diameter of the stereo - a images by 5.4% .",
    "figures  [ euvi_195 ] and [ euvi_171 ] show running ratio images ( i.e.  each image is divided by the previous one ) of the coronal wave observed in the euvi 195   and 171   passband , respectively .",
    "the coronal wave fronts could be identified and measured in 7  images taken in the 171   and 4  images in the 195   filter during a period of @xmath330  min .",
    "the wave shows global propagation ( see 195   image at 13:02  ut ) but is most pronounced towards w and nw .",
    "the wave  radiant point \" was estimated by applying circular fits to the two earliest wave fronts observed in 171 and 195   after transforming the data from the 2d cartesian @xmath6-plane to the 3d spherical @xmath7-plane ( solar radius , heliographic latitude and longitude ) .",
    "the center of curvature of the wave was found on the nw border of ar  10956 . in fig .",
    "[ euvi_image ] , the determined wave centers together with the strongest wavefront segments are plotted .",
    "in contrast to moreton waves , 360@xmath5 propagation is not uncommon for coronal waves ( e.g. , discovery event of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "simulations by @xcite revealed that the wave is strongly refracted / reflected by ars , but part of it can pass through .",
    "if the ar is small , the wave can be diffracted into the region behind the ar ( passing above and aside ) , which may be the case in the event under study .",
    "we also note that the wave was refracted and reflected at the coronal hole in the sw solar quadrant ( cf .",
    "[ euvi_image ] ) .",
    "figure  [ euvi_kinematics ] shows the distance - time diagram of the wave derived by calculating the mean distance of the wave fronts from the wave center along great circles on the lower corona , where the euvi wave is observed ( estimated to be 10  mm above the photosphere ) .",
    "for the kinematics , we used only the strongest wavefront segments ( at 13:02  ut the global wave front ) shown in fig .",
    "[ euvi_image ] .",
    "the linear fit to the distance - time diagram gives a mean wave velocity of 260  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the quadratic fit yields a start velocity of 460  km  s@xmath8 , a ( constant ) deceleration of @xmath9  m  s@xmath10 and an extrapolated wave launch time ( intersect with @xmath11-axis ) of 12:45  ut . the inset in fig .",
    "[ euvi_kinematics ] shows the wavefront velocity derived by numerical derivative of the measured time - distance data using 3-point linear interpolation , together with the applied fits .",
    "the velocity evolution demonstrates that the wave decelerates , with the earliest velocities as high as 400500  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this is considerably faster than the velocities reported for eit waves ( 170350  km  s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we attribute to the much better cadence of euvi , allowing us to study the wave s evolution .    up to now , deceleration of coronal waves",
    "was mainly hypothesized from the deceleration observed in chromospheric moreton waves recorded with high cadence , and from their combination with ( mostly single ) eit wave fronts lying on the extrapolated kinematical curve of the decelerating moreton wave @xcite .",
    "evidence for deceleration of coronal waves was provided also from soft x - ray imaging in @xcite .",
    "however , in the coronal wave studied in @xcite the general picture was quite different in that some parts of the wave fronts showed acceleration . initial acceleration of the wave is actually expected from the theoretical point of view ( see fig .  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "the lasco / soho catalog @xcite reports two cmes in association with the coronal wave under study : cme1 was observed at a position angle  pa of 260@xmath5 in the fov 320  @xmath1 with a mean velocity of 960  km  s@xmath8 , cme2 at pa 310@xmath5 in the fov 310  @xmath1 with 290  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "both cmes were rather poor events , but associated with an interplanetary magnetic cloud observed in situ at @xmath31  au on 21/22 may 2007 by stereo and wind @xcite .",
    "cor1 on stereo - a did not observe the fast cme1 ( which was very faint ) but it observed the evolution of cme2 in the low corona .",
    "the linear fit gives a mean cme2 velocity of 430  km  s@xmath8 in the fov 1.52.5  @xmath1 ; the quadratic fit gives a start velocity of 650  km  s@xmath8 at 12:48  ut , and a deceleration of @xmath12  m  s@xmath10 .    in fig .",
    "[ euvi_kso ] we plot a sequence of h@xmath0 filtergrams which show the earliest sign of the eruption , two erupting filaments .",
    "their orientation and direction is consistent with the position angles of the two cmes .",
    "filament1 ( towards w ) has disappeared from the h@xmath0 filter at 12:46 ut , filament2 ( towards nw ) at 12:55  ut ( see fig .  [ euvi_kso ] ) .",
    "the filament evolution appears more complex in euvi 171   images , with fast changes / eruption of the filament system starting between 12:49:00 and 12:51:30 ut .",
    "in figure  [ euvi_summary ] , we show a summary plot comprising : a ) the distance - time diagram of the coronal wave observed by euvi / stereo - a , b ) the back - extrapolated ( quadratic fit ) distance - time diagram of cme1 observed with lasco / soho , c ) the distance - time diagram of cme2 observed with cor1/stereo - a , d ) the flare hard x - ray flux recorded by rhessi , and e ) the flare soft x - ray flux recorded by goes . from the quadratic fit to the euvi wave kinematics , we estimate the wave s launch time to @xmath312:45  ut . the real launch may happen somewhat later , since this method assumes a point - like origin of the wave .",
    "the flare 1225  kev hard x - ray flux starts rising at 12:50  ut with the first and highest peak at 12:51:30  ut . at this time",
    ", we already observe the first euvi wave front .",
    "such timing argues against a flare - origin of the wave , since the wave needs time to build up a large amplitude or shock to be observable . on the other hand , timing and direction of the erupting filaments",
    "indicate that the wave was closely associated with the fast cme1 , since filament1 disappeared from the h@xmath0 filter at 12:46  ut , whereas filament2 remained visible until 12:55  ut .",
    "however , the kinematics of the coronal wave is quite different from the kinematics of the cme s leading edge ( see fig .",
    "[ euvi_summary ] ) : the wave is slower than both cmes and significantly decelerates , which is a typical characteristics of a large - amplitude mhd simple wave @xcite : such a freely propagating perturbation is powered only temporarily by a source region expansion , which could be due to the flare - related pressure pulse , due to small scale flare ejecta or due to the cme expanding flanks ( which propagate laterally only over a limited distance ) . since perturbation elements with larger amplitude travel faster than those with smaller amplitude ( nonlinearity ) , the perturbation profile steepens until finally a discontinuity is formed . as a consequence of energy conservation , the amplitude of the perturbation decreases with distance , first due to spherical expansion ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) , and second , because the crest of the shock travels faster than its trail , causing broading of the perturbation profile @xcite .",
    "consequently , the wave decays into an ordinary , i.e.  small amplitude wave propagating with the characteristic speed of the medium . for waves propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field ,",
    "this is the magnetosonic speed @xmath15 with @xmath16 the alfvn velocity and @xmath17 the sound speed .",
    "the  final \" velocity reached by the euvi wave under study lies in the range @xmath18  km s@xmath8 ( see fig .  [ euvi_kinematics ] ) , which is a reasonable value of @xmath19 in the quiet solar corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though we note that there is an ongoing discussion on this subject ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the observed euvi wave deceleration together with the closely related timing of the wave and the erupting filament1/cme1 ( in contrast to the flare peak which occurs too late ) as well as the wave front shape which is roughly concentric with filament1 , hint at an initiation of the wave by the cme expanding flanks . in such a scenario , the wave is only driven over a limited distance and then decays into an ordinary mhd wave .",
