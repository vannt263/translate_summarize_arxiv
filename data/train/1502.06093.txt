    "every event of ionization of a neutral particle in tokamak plasma it followed by the displacement of the newly born charges ( electron and ion ) towards the equilibrium orbits .",
    "they leave the magnetic surface where they have been created , due to the neoclassical drift , and evolve towards stationary trajectories . since the electrons drift much less than the ions , the main effect is associated with the newly born ions . neglecting collisions , the ions will settle on circulating or trapped orbits and during the periodic motions they depart radially , relative to a certain magnetic surface , alternatively to larger and respectively to smaller radius .",
    "since these positive and negative radial deviations relative to the magnetic surface compensate , the time average shows no effective radial displacement : the orbit has an effective center  which corresponds to the spatial average of the successive positions of the ion ( for example : the center  of a banana , for the trapped ion ; we neglect smaller neoclassical motions of this center , like the toroidal drift ) .",
    "however there is a part in the radial excursion of the new ion which remains uncompensated .",
    "this is precisely the first interval , just after the ionization , when the ion evolves to take the periodic trajectory , and its successive positions do not yet average to the center .",
    "this displacement , from the position where ionization takes place , towards the center  of the periodic trajectory , is an effective radial current . at the end of this finite , transitory part ,",
    "the motion becomes periodic and there is no radial current .",
    "the radial current of the first part is a source of torque , implicitly rotation and in this way has an impact on the quality of the confinement .",
    "it effectively makes a connection between the density change ( via pellets , gas puff or impurity seeding ) and the change of the confinement .",
    "we note that there is a considerable experimental evidence that the variation of density ( during the discharge ) produces a change in the quality of the confinement .    on a fast time",
    "scale a radial electric field is generated by the charge separation : the electrons are almost tied to the magnetic surface , while the ions will travel with the neoclassical drift velocity to their center , on a distance about half of a banana width .",
    "we estimate the radial current and obtain an order of magnitude of the rate of the torque . compared with the damping rate of a poloidal rotation by transit time magnetic pumping",
    ", the ionization - induced rate can be substantially higher .",
    "some improved regimes in jet , as pellet enhanced performance  ( pep ) pepjetreview , @xcite , diii - d @xcite , improvedcorefuelling  and confinement changes observed in many devices @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , startrotationtournianski appear to be connected with this effect of density variation .",
    "the ionization - induced torque has a direction which is fixed by neoclassical orbit s geometry and it interacts with any pre - existing rotation which may have been induced by reynolds stress , stringer mechanism or by external factors ( nbi , icrh ) .",
    "the new torque can enhance the pre - existing rotation or can act against it , which makes difficult to predict its consequences in all situations .",
    "we suggest that this process may be a unifying connection between a wide class of regimes where it has been noted a correlation between a dynamic change of density ( within a discharge ) and the change of the confinement .    according to the preceding explanation , there are two mechanisms that are responsible for this connection    \\(1 )",
    "the change of density via ionization ( of a pellet , gas puff , impurity seeding or influx of neutral atoms from the edge ) means that @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) fraction of the newly created ions are trapped and  are moving radially to occupy the positions ( the centers ) which are the averages of positions on the trapped ( banana ) orbits .",
    "while after arriving there the bounce averaged radial displacement is zero for the trapped ion , the first step , when the ion moves from the place where it has been created to the center  of the banana is a net radial current , a single and unrepeatable event for every ionization event .",
    "the ensemble of such events is a radial current that produces a torque which generates poloidal rotation and sustains it against magnetic pumping florinmadieps13 ; the sheared poloidal rotation is a barrier that reduce the turbulence and enhances the confinement .",
    "\\(2 ) every conversion of a trapped ion into a circulating one ( and equally the reversed process ) , is accompanied by a substantial radial drift .",
    "this is because the centers  of the two kinds of orbits are different and the change from one type of periodic motion ( _ e.g. _ trapped ) to the other type of periodic motion ( circulating ) goes through an intermediate regime , unique and transitory .",
    "it consists of the last part of the motion on banana , when the periodicity is lost , followed by the first part of the motion , until the new periodicity is established .",
    "both these parts are unique and transitory and are manifested as a radial current which produces a torque . then any dynamic process which implies a ( slow or fast ) change in the velocity space in the region : trapped / circulating ions , will produce a torque .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is a mechanism of _ direct _ coupling between the toroidal and poloidal rotation .",
    "if for some reason a toroidal flow occurs in plasma , a number of trapped ions will have increased their parallel velocity and will change from trapped to circulating @xcite .",
    "the associated radial current produces a poloidal torque .",
    "conversely , stopping the toroidal rotation leads a subset of the ion population to convert from circulating to trapped , which again produces a transient radial current and further poloidal rotation .    in the present work we concentrate on only the first of the two processes",
    "several effects can be connected with this ionization - induced torque .",
    "regimes that are confirmed by experiments , like the mentioned pep , density peaking and/or anomalous density pinch may have a connection with this torque . the dynamic charge separation that occurs",
    "when the ions move from the place of ionization to the centerof the neoclassical periodic orbit induces a return current of the background ions . since the number of new ions generated by ionization of a pellet is episodically comparable with the local background ion density , the response motion of this latter population takes the aspect of a massive , even if short , radial displacement . on a relatively large space interval , on which the radial derivative of the rate of ionization [ @xmath2/@xmath3 in eq.([jtapp ] ) below ]",
    "keeps the same sign , the displacement of the background ions has a unique direction and is sustained all along the total time of ionization .",
    "this appears as a density pinch , eventually contributing to the density peaking .",
    "since this equally involves the impurity ions , it can provide a new mechanism for the impurity accumulation .",
    "we note that the ionization of impurity atoms leads to much larger radial drifts and in consequence larger radial currents and torque .",
    "this must be examined in relation with impurity ( argon ) seeding at the edge and with _ li _ pellets in the core . in general",
    "any influx of neutral atoms in the plasma will be a source of rotation which affects the local conditions , including the possibility of being a trigger for the _",
    "l _ to _ h _ mode transition .",
    "we give in the next sections a simple description of the statistical build - up of a radial current associated with the ionization . at this level of description",
    "the collisions are neglected , as are the dispersions of the absolute magnitude of velocities , and of the parallel velocities .",
    "the intention is to draw attention to the high amplitude of this current .",
    "further , our result is confirmed by the drift - kinetic neoclassical approach , developed in parallel to the classical treatments of rosenbluth and hinton for the similar cases of the torque induced by _ alpha _",
    "particles rosenbluthhintonalpha and by _ neutral beam injection _",
    "( nbi ) hintonrosenbluthnbi .",
    "for an easier discussion we adopt a simple picture , mainly having in mind the pellet injection .",
    "the source is considered to be limited to a finite segment @xmath4 $ ] on the radius @xmath5 , placed somewhere between @xmath6 ( magnetic axis ) and @xmath7 ( edge ) . due to the symmetry",
    "we take the segment as lying in the equatorial plane .",
    "the words left  or right  refer to this segment , with left being closer to the magnetic axis .",
    "the newly born ions will move to place themselves on the periodic neoclassical trajectories , banana or circulating .",
    "a radial current is produced during only the first , unique and transitory , part of the trajectory , which is about half of the width of the banana .",
    "we start with a purely geometric example .",
    "consider the motion of a point on a circle @xmath8 with radius @xmath9 and center at @xmath10 on the @xmath11 axis .",
    "we introduce the angle @xmath12 between the @xmath13 axis and the radius from the center of the circle @xmath14 to the position of the point on the circle @xmath15 .",

    "clearly the asymptotic @xmath28 average position will be @xmath29 , which is the center  and , after a transient phase , the motion is periodic .",
    "the speed with which the average position moves is @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the @xmath31-projection of the average , @xmath32 , is always positive and that for small time , @xmath33 , the @xmath34-projected average is linear in time @xmath35 .",
    "both properties will also be found for banana orbits .",
    "the speed of the ions on this transient part of its motion is the neoclassical drift velocity @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath38 are respectively the perpendicular and the parallel velocity of the ion , @xmath39 is the magnetic moment , @xmath40 is the versor of the magnetic field @xmath41 and @xmath9 is the radius of curvature of the magnetic line .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath42 , constant and positive .",
    "the sign  of the velocity will be given according to the particular type of ion s motion and according to the helical orientation of the magnetic field line .",
    "the latter is given by the direction of the plasma current , which we take in the following anti - parallel to the main magnetic field .",
    "we consider first the trapped @xmath43 ions that have , at the moment of ionization , parallel velocity in the same direction with the magnetic field @xmath44 and we note that their banana is entirely outside the magnetic surface on which the ionization has taken place .",
    "the ion radial displacement , on the length @xmath45 half of the ion banana and only on the time interval of this displacement @xmath46 , is toward the edge .",
    "the trapped ions that have in the point of ionization a velocity anti - parallel to the magnetic field vector , @xmath47 have banana orbit entirely inside the magnetic surface and the transitory displacement of the new ion , until the center  of this banana , is towards smaller @xmath5 radius , @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is defined positive ) .",
    "in addition there are circulating @xmath50 new ions , _",
    "i.e. _ on untrapped orbits .",
    "those that have at the initial point a momentum directed parallel to the magnetic field @xmath44 have a circular orbit which is entirely inside the magnetic surface on which the ionization has taken place .",
    "the effective displacement to the virtual center is toward larger radius , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is defined positive ) .",
    "the last type consists of ions that are circulating and with their velocity at the initial point anti - parallel to the magnetic field @xmath53 . for them",
    "the closed orbit fully includes the magnetic surface and  it is equivalent to the displacement of the average position of the new ion to smaller @xmath5 , toward the magnetic axis , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is defined positive ) .",
    "the four contributions to the current through @xmath56 , from the two pairs ( _ _ i.e.__@xmath57-trapped , respectively @xmath58-circulating ) appear to be small and they partly compensate , having opposite signs .",
    "however , even the small remaining ( effective ) radial displacement , multiplied with the rate of generation of new ions , leads to a significant radial current .",
    "there is another aspect : the centers of the two bananas discussed above [ @xmath44 and @xmath47 ] are spatially separated and we can associate to them the full population of new ions generated in those two positions .",
    "the rate of ionization , expressed in number of ions per @xmath60 per second has a significant radial variation , both for pellets and for gas - puff : the rate of generation of new ions may differ substantially between two radial positions , even if they have small separation , of the order of centimeters .",
    "the two banana centers are separated by a distance @xmath61 which is in this range and suggests that the radial variation of the rate of ionization is an important factor .    for any point @xmath5 ,",
    "the four contributions combine into a single , short - lived , finite - spatial size - event of ion charge displacement , _",
    "i.e. _ a current .",

    "quantitatively the two fluxes are balanced but ions from edge can travel very far toward the center .",
    "impurity accumulation in the center can also be produced in this process .",
    "second , the rotation produced at ionization is necessarily sheared , _ i.e. _ @xmath309 , for two reasons . in the regions of positive and respectively negative radial derivative of the rate of ionization @xmath310",
    "the rotation has opposite direction ( figures 3 and 5 ) .",
    "in addition , the background ions must have a local rotation that is opposite to that of the new ions .",
    "the rate of extraction of the free energy from density gradients is reduced and the turbulence will have shorter radial correlation length . the rate of transport decreases and the peaking of the density in the center is enhanced by the smaller density diffusion .",
    "third , the shear of the poloidal velocity is actually vorticity @xmath311 and when this occurs the ertel s theorem @xmath312 imposes a redistribution of density .    a change of the density at the edge , by impurity seeding impurityseedingd3d or by other strong ionization event , must now also be regarded as an electric process , due to the charge separation and the radial current of the new ions .",
    "it implies that very fast plasma responses should be expected @xcite .",
    "this may explain observed fast propagation of perturbations , sometimes called non - local .",
    "fast increase of the radial electric field is able to determine , as a neoclassical effect , the reversal of the toroidal rotation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented arguments that the neoclassical displacements of the new ions generated at ionization ( of gas puff , pellet , impurity seeding ) produce a radial current that can be substantial .",
    "the current is generated from the first part , transitory , unique for any ionization event , of the trajectory : between the ionization and the moment where the new ion reaches the stationary periodic motion , trapped or circulating .",
    "the torque resulting from ionization can be substantial and it can generate internal transport barriers .",
    "our perspective on some particular regimes may need reconsideration : pellet enhanced performance , density peaking , density pinch , regimes with density higher than the greenwald limit , fast propagation of edge effects , influence of the density on the transition to _",

    "<S> a change of the particle density ( by gas puff , pellets or impurity seeding ) during the plasma discharge in tokamak produces a radial current and implicitly a torque and rotation that can modify the state of confinement . </S>",
    "<S> after ionization the newly born ions will evolve toward the periodic neoclassical orbits ( trapped or circulating ) but the first part of their excursion , which precedes the periodicity , is an effective radial current . </S>",
    "<S> it is short , spatially finite and unique for each new ion , but multiplied by the rate of ionization and it can produce a substantial total radial current . the associated torque induces rotation which modify the transport processes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the magnitude of the radial current induced by ionization by three methods : the analysis of a simple physical picture , a numerical model and the neoclassical drift - kinetic treatment . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the three approaches are in agreement and show that the current can indeed be substantial . </S>",
    "<S> many well known experimental observations can be reconsidered under this perspective . in reactor - grade plasma </S>",
    "<S> the confinement can be strongly influenced by adequate particle fuelling . </S>"
