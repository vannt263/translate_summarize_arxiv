    "in the last decade , studies of three - body collisional processes have attracted tremendous attention due to their great relevance for the rapidly growing field of cold and ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . in such systems , three - body recombination and elastic and inelastic atom - molecule collisions are of particular interest .",
    "three - body recombination is a scattering process where three free particles collide , with two of them binding to form a molecular state , converting the binding energy into the relative kinetic energy of the atom and molecule produced .",
    "three - body recombination , therefore , is important generically as it can shed light on binding in nuclear and chemical reactions . in ultracold atomic gas experiments ,",
    "three - body recombination can lead to huge losses near a feshbach resonance  @xcite and has been studied extensively to understand the lifetime and the stability of the gas samples  @xcite .",
    "elastic atom - molecule collisions are crucial for determining the dynamics of ultracold atom - molecule mixtures at the mean - field level , and inelastic atom - molecule collisions have a big impact on the lifetime of feshbach molecules in such systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the regime of large two - body @xmath10-wave scattering length @xmath11 , achieved near a feshbach resonance , three - body collisional processes show universal scaling behavior with @xmath11 as result of efimov physics  @xcite .",
    "these universal aspects have been observed experimentally in recent years  @xcite and confirm our understanding of three - body universal properties  @xcite .",
    "ultracold three - body collisions , however , are only universal when the dynamics are predominantly determined by the long - range behavior of the atom - atom scattering wave function .",
    "when a system behaves universally , the complicated atom - atom interaction can thus be replaced with a much simpler model designed to reproduce the long - range wave function .",
    "it is in this context that the adiabatic hyperspherical representation has been applied to the calculation of three - body recombination .",
    "while it has proven very useful for getting deeper insights into this process , calculating recombination for chemically important species using realistic interactions requires substantial further technical development , but does not pose fundamental difficulties .",
    "nevertheless , there are a few realistic systems that are sufficiently simple that recombination calculations are possible with the tools already available .",
    "for instance , recombination of helium atoms , for which there is a single @xmath12he@xmath13 ro - vibrational bound state , has been studied within the adiabatic hyperspherical representation  @xcite .",
    "parker , _ et al .",
    "_ have studied the ne+ne+h system , calculating the @xmath14=@xmath8 partial wave contribution to recombination and collision induced dissociation rates  @xcite .",
    "the studies done by suno _",
    "et al . _ for three helium atoms  @xcite and for he+he+alkali systems  @xcite have included higher partial wave contributions in order to calculate the total recombination rate up to temperatures of at least 10  mk .",
    "these results are relevant to the buffer gas cooling technique used in cold and ultracold experiments  @xcite , where three - body recombination can lead to dramatic losses .    in this paper , we study three - body processes involving two hydrogen atoms and one alkali atom .",
    "if all atoms are spin - stretched , these systems are amenable to calculation since the h+h interaction has no bound state and @xmath0+h has only a single @xmath10-wave bound state for all the alkali species , @xmath0 , considered here  @xcite : @xmath1li , @xmath2na , @xmath3k , @xmath4rb and @xmath5cs . in thermal alkali - hydrogen mixtures , the recombination rate @xmath15 for the process h+h+@xmath0@xmath6@xmath0h+h is related to the density of the alkali atoms by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the densities of the h atoms and alkali atoms , respectively .",
    "note that there is a @xmath19 reduction in the rate if the hydrogen atoms are in a condensate  @xcite .",
    "the three - body calculations are thus simplified by having only one recombination channel , but the presence of sharp avoided crossings in the three - body potentials makes the calculations a challenge in the adiabatic representation .",
    "these sharp crossings are between different families of adiabatic potentials corresponding to h+h and @xmath0+h .",
    "we will use atomic units throughout unless specified otherwise .",
    "it is also convenient to convert energies to temperature units by dividing by boltzmann s constant @xmath20 , i.e. 3.17@xmath2110@xmath22  a.u.=1  k.",
    "after separating the center - of - mass motion , the relative motion of the three particles can be represented by the mass - scaled jacobi vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the lab - frame position vectors of the two hydrogen atoms with mass @xmath29 and the alkali atom with mass @xmath30 , respectively . in the above equations ,",
    "the mass scaling factor @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 the three - body reduced mass is defined as follows to preserve the phase - space volume element  @xcite : @xmath33    in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation , the hyperradius @xmath34 , @xmath35=@xmath36 , is the only coordinate with the dimension of length and represents the overall size of the three - body system .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom , the hyperangles , are represented collectively by @xmath37 .",
    "we use body - frame delves coordinates  @xcite such that @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the angle between the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining hyperangles are the three euler angles @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 describing the rotation of the plane containing the three particles . as a result ,",
    "the interparticle distances @xmath45 are determined in terms of the internal coordinates ( @xmath34 , @xmath40 , @xmath46 ) only : @xmath47 this definition of the hyperangles facilitates the symmetrization of the wave function under exchange of the two h atoms .",
    "after rescaling the three - body wave function @xmath48 as @xmath49=@xmath50 , the three - body schrdinger equation takes the form @xmath51\\psi = e\\psi , \\label{eq_sch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 includes all the interactions and @xmath53 is the hyperangular momentum operator , defined by taking @xmath23 to be the quantization axis for the body - fixed frame  @xcite and expressed as : @xmath54 with @xmath55 the components @xmath56 are the total orbital angular momentum operator projected on the body - frame axes .",
    "since we assume the atoms to be spin - stretched , i.e. , in the total spin state with the largest magnitude spin projection , the relevant born - oppenheimer potential surface is the lowest quartet surface .",
    "we approximate this surface as a pairwise sum of @xmath57 two - body potentials : @xmath58 the two - body potentials @xmath59 and @xmath60 are shown in fig .  [ fig_2bpot ] .",
    "at small distances , these potentials are determined from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite while their long - range behavior is determined by the usual dispersion potentials  @xcite .",
    "note that for three atoms , a non - additive three - body term should be included in @xmath52 .",
    "this three - body term depends on the spatial configuration of the three atoms and can be significant for certain configurations .",
    "the only fully quantum mechanical recombination calculation for a realistic system that has so far included the three - body term found its effect to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "but , that work treated he , and he is not very polarizable compared to h or the other alkalis . the impact of the three - body term for the present systems is thus expected to be correspondingly larger .",
    "unfortunately , neither the full three - body surface nor the three - body term is available for the quartet state of h+h+@xmath0 .",
    "the importance of the three - body term for the systems we are investigating , though , can be estimated qualitatively by looking at the available three - body terms for the quartet surface of identical alkali atoms  @xcite , as they have similar electronic structure .",
    "the three - body term is most significant when all the atoms are close together . for li",
    ", the three - body potential can make the minimum of the total potential about four times deeper than the pair - wise sum potential  @xcite . for heavier alkali atoms",
    ", the three - body term can change the potential minimum by a factor of 1.21.5  @xcite . when the atoms are far apart , a three - body dispersion interaction should also be included .",
    "the contribution of this interaction , however , is much smaller . for li",
    ", the three - body dispersion interaction is a few percent of the pair - wise sum potential , and even smaller for heavier alkali atoms  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that our results will change dramatically when the three - body interactions are included . we know , for instance , that the numerical value of the rate can change over a broad range for model problems  @xcite .",
    "however , as the first calculation for h+h+@xmath0 systems , our results can give a sense of the order of magnitude for the three - body observables , and serve as a starting point for the study of three - body interactions in such three - body systems .",
    "we further note that including a three - body term or a full three - body surface poses no particular problem for our approach  @xcite .",
    "potentials for h+h and @xmath0+h . among all these combinations , only @xmath0+h systems have a single , weakly bound molecular state . ]    in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq_sch ] ) , we first expand the three - body wave function as @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the channel functions obtained as the solutions of the adiabatic equation @xmath63\\phi_\\nu = u_\\nu(r)\\phi_\\nu . \\label{eq_adiabatic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we solve this equation as a function of @xmath34 , and its eigenvalues are the adiabatic potentials @xmath64 . therefore , upon substitution of @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_sch ] ) reduces to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations : @xmath65\\!f_{\\nu e}(r ) \\!-\\!\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\sum_{\\nu'}\\!\\left[p_{\\nu \\nu'}(r)\\frac{d}{dr}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!+\\frac{d}{dr}p_{\\nu \\nu'}(r)+q_{\\nu \\nu'}(r)\\bigg]f_{\\nu ' e}(r)\\!=\\!e f_{\\nu e}(r ) , \\label{eq_radial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with non - adiabatic couplings @xmath66 and @xmath67 given by @xmath68 here , the double brackets denote integration over only the hyperangular degrees of freedom .    in our calculations ,",
    "the biggest computational burden comes from solving the five - dimensional adiabatic equation  ( [ eq_adiabatic ] ) . to facilitate its solution , we separate out the external degrees of freedom ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and",
    "simultaneously obtain eigenstates of total orbital angular momentum and parity by further expanding the adiabatic wave functions @xmath69 on the basis of symmetrized wigner @xmath70 functions  @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the total parity of the system , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the projection of the total orbital angular momentum on the body - fixed and space - fixed @xmath75 axes , respectively . since molecules @xmath0h have only a single @xmath10-wave state , recombination only happens for the parity - favored case , i.e. , when @xmath72=@xmath76 .",
    "although we are solving for the motion of the nuclei , we must require that the total wave function , including the electronic degrees of freedom , is antisymmetric under exchange of the two protons .",
    "for the electronic symmetry we are considering , exchanging protons introduces a sign change in the electronic wave function .",
    "thus , the nuclear part of the wave function must be symmetric under proton exchange .",
    "since we neglect hyperfine interactions , we can couple the two protons spin to give a total spin @xmath77=0,1 and consider their contribution to recombination independently . for @xmath77=1 ,",
    "the spin wave function is symmetric under exchange , requiring the spatial wave function to also be symmetric .",
    "such spatial symmetry leads to non - vanishing @xmath15 at ultracold temperatures  @xcite . for @xmath77=0 , however , the spin wave function is antisymmetric under exchange of the two protons , and the spatial wave function is therefore also antisymmetric .",
    "for this symmetry , @xmath15 vanishes in the zero temperature limit  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate @xmath15 for @xmath77=1 , which is the dominant recombination process for ultracold temperatures . for more general cases where",
    "the @xmath77=1 state is not preferentially prepared , our results give only a partial contribution to @xmath15 for temperatures beyond the ultracold regime .",
    "we built the exchange symmetry of the two protons into the boundary conditions of the body - frame components @xmath78 .",
    "permuting the two protons only affects the hyperangles @xmath37 : @xmath79 for even parity , the permutation requirements can be equivalently expressed as @xmath78 being symmetric about @xmath40=@xmath80 for even @xmath73 and antisymmetric for odd @xmath73 . for odd parity , @xmath78 should be antisymmetric for even @xmath73 and symmetric for odd @xmath73 . imposing these boundary conditions ,",
    "we need only solve eq .",
    "( [ eq_adiabatic ] ) in the range @xmath81 .",
    "asymptotically , i.e. , as @xmath82 , the adiabatic potentials with the diagonal couplings included are determined by the energies of the break - up components . for the atom - molecule channel , the potentials behave like @xmath83 where the partial angular momentum @xmath84 is the relative orbital angular momentum between the atom and the molecule .",
    "since all of the @xmath0h systems have only an @xmath10-wave bound state , @xmath84=@xmath85 .",
    "for the three - body break - up channels , the potentials behave like @xmath86 the values of @xmath87 are non - negative integers determined by @xmath7 and the identical particle symmetry  @xcite .",
    "accurate numerical calculations of the three - body observables depend largely on the accuracy of the adiabatic potentials and channel functions [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq_adiabatic ] ) and ( [ channelfunctions ] ) ] and , ultimately , on the non - adiabatic couplings [ eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) ] . by expanding the body - frame components @xmath88 on a two - dimensional , direct product b - spline basis  @xcite",
    ", we obtain accurate potentials and couplings up to @xmath89  a.u .. beyond this distance , we extrapolate the potentials using the known asymptotic expansions  @xcite .",
    "typically , a ( @xmath40 , @xmath46 ) mesh of 60@xmath21250 gives eigenvalues converged to at least eight digits .",
    "we have found that due to the sharp avoided crossings occurring at small @xmath34 , a hyperradial grid of about 3000 points is necessary to accurately resolve most of the abrupt changes in the non - adiabatic couplings .",
    "many sharper crossings remain , though , that must be traced individually .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that when the scattering length @xmath11 greatly exceeds the characteristic range of the two - body interaction , three - body scattering observables are dramatically affected . for the systems we consider here ,",
    "the long - range part of the two - body interaction is the van der waals potential @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , they are characterized by the van der waals length @xmath91  @xcite , where @xmath92 is the two - body reduced mass . in table",
    "[ tab_2bscatt ] , we list the bound state energies , the scattering lengths , and the van der waals lengths for all of the two - body potentials we used .",
    "notice that none the scattering lengths are substantially larger than the van der waals lengths and thus the condition for universal behavior ( @xmath93 ) is not fulfilled . as a result",
    ", we do not expect to observe universal physics for these systems .",

    ", we have verified numerically that the triatomic binding energies are indeed predominantly determined by the lowest adiabatic channel @xmath96 .",
    "specifically , the channel probability @xmath97 for @xmath96 is beyond 99% for all the systems .",
    "the channel functions @xmath98 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fr ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that , except for kh@xmath13 , all the triatomic states have a large hyperradial extent , reaching values up to a few hundred atomic units consistent with the bond lengths listed in table  [ tab_e3b ] .",
    "hyperradial channel function @xmath98 for the triatomic bound states . ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied three - body scattering and the bound state spectra for two hydrogen atoms and one alkali atom using a fully quantum mechanical approach . solving the three - body schrdinger equation in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation ,",
    "we have calculated the three - body recombination rates and atom - molecule elastic cross sections for all the alkali species for temperatures up to 0.5 kelvin .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in our calculations by far is the interaction potential .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that our results give a correct order - of - magnitude estimate of the three - body scattering observables . for three - body recombination",
    ", the lowest three partial waves dominate the total recombination rates in the energy range we have calculated . for the elastic atom - molecule collisions ,",
    "the cross sections are dominated by a single partial wave contribution for the energy range in our calculations , which is @xmath7=@xmath8 at lower energies and @xmath7=@xmath99 at higher energies .",
    "the bound state spectra are very simple , with only one ro - vibrational three - body state for each of the alkali species .",
    "finally , the difficulty of sharply avoided crossings we met at small hyperradius raises an alert for doing adiabatic calculations for realistic systems .",
    "the complicated short - range three - body dynamics can give rise to rapidly varying behavior in the adiabatic potentials and the non - adiabatic couplings , which makes the adiabatic calculations much harder and less reliable .",
