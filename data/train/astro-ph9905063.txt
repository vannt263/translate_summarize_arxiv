    "in this paper we present near  infrared ( nir ) @xmath0-band images of a sample of 174 spiral galaxies located in the region of the pisces - perseus ( pp ) supercluster , the largest low - redshift structure in the southern galactic hemisphere . although a number of measured infrared magnitudes exist in the literature for some clusters in this area ( aaronson et al .",
    "1986 ) , this is the first large nir imaging survey of this structure and , together with the published surveys in the coma supercluster ( gavazzi et al . 1996a , c ) and in virgo ( boselli et al .",
    "1997 ) , it makes up an extended database to investigate the properties of these most outstanding low - redshift superclusters and of their member galaxies .",
    "the data were collected to pursue several distinct lines of research : to probe the internal extinction in spiral disks ( moriondo et al . 1998c ) ; to map peculiar motions in the supercluster ( baffa et al .",
    "1993 ) ; to study stellar populations and dark matter content ( moriondo et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .    as detailed in the following section , the galaxies observed pertain to two distinct sets : the first one",
    "was observed in the @xmath0-band only ; the second one in three different passbands : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , when possible .",
    "we defer the publication and analysis of the colour images to a forthcoming paper , and report here the @xmath0-band observations , that is the passband with the largest wealth of data , both in the literature and in our present data set .",
    "although the resulting sample lacks completeness , the data are remarkably homogeneous both because of the type of objects included and for the uniformity in the observational and image reduction techniques .",
    "as it will be shown , the sample comprises a fair representation of the bright disk galaxies hosted in the entire supercluster .",
    "the sample objects were selected from the catalogued disk galaxies in the pisces - perseus supercluster area , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , excluding obvious foreground members with @xmath15@xmath16 and ellipticals .",
    "to best fit the camera fields of view to be employed , the sample was restricted to galaxies with optical major axis @xmath17 , and , among these , we further selected those with available good - quality 21-cm spectra ( giovanelli & haynes 1989 and references therein ) . these selection criteria result into about 950 galaxies , mainly late spirals . from this set",
    "two distinct subsamples were extracted .",
    "sample a comprises about 150 galaxies , randomly selected to cover the entire area and inclination range , and with types sb or later ; for these objects only @xmath0-band data were acquired .",
    "sample b includes the 50 cluster galaxies with distance @xmath18 from the pisces cluster center ( @xmath19 ) , with optical size @xmath20 , and inclination @xmath21 ; for these objects , ranging in morphology from s0 to sd , @xmath11 and @xmath12-band images were acquired .",
    "due to malfunctions and bad weather , not all the sample objects could be observed . as a whole 177 objects",
    "were observed at least in one band ( usually @xmath0 ) , 147 of which belong to the supercluster sample ( sample a ) and 35 to the cluster one ( sample b ) ; five galaxies are common to both samples .",
    "this paper presents data for the 174 galaxies imaged in the @xmath0 bandpass .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sample objects is depicted , in an equal - area projection , in fig .",
    "[ sky - distr ] .",
    "the region is bounded to the east by the zone of avoidance due to extinction in the galactic plane . despite its scarcity ,",
    "our sample delineates the overall structure of the supercluster as portrayed by much richer sets ( e.g. giovanelli et al .",
    "the main ridge appears clearly , spanning the entire r.a .",
    "range between 30@xmath22 and 40@xmath22 declination , as well as the southern extensions down to the a400 and pegasus clusters . despite the presence of several rich clusters in the area ,",
    "the only clear clustering is noted at the position of the pisces cluster ( ngc 507 : @xmath23 ) ; obviously this is due to the galaxies of sample b.    in fig .",
    "[ b - distr ] we plot the cumulative distribution in photographic magnitude ( @xmath24 system ) .",
    "when compared to the expectation for a uniformly distributed set , the sample starts deviating and losing completeness at @xmath25-mag ; there is also a notable a lack of bright galaxies ( @xmath26 ) . both limits",
    "are mainly induced by the constraints on the apparent size and only to a minor degree by the characteristics of the ugc ( nilson 1973 ) and cgcg ( zwicky et al .",
    "1961 - 68 ) catalogues , from which the sample was originally drawn ; the scarcity of bright objects also follows the exclusion of foreground objects .    the morphological distribution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ t - distr ] .",
    "the types are drawn from the rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) where most of our sample galaxies have a detailed revised hubble ( rh ) classification ; only 16 are classified s or sb without further specification , and only two non - ugc objects are not classified .",
    "as expected , due to the selection based on 21-cm observations , the sample mainly consists of late spiral types and peaks around @xmath27 , that is sbc .",
    "the sample galaxies were observed in the course of several observing campaigns , from december , 1992 until february , 1997 .",
    "most of the data were collected at the tirgo telescope ( zermatt , ch ) in 1992 , 1993 , 1994 and 1997 ; some galaxies were observed at the not telscope ( la palma , canary islands ) in 1995 and some at the vatt telescope ( mt . graham , az ) in 1996 .",
    "the instrument used at all telescopes was the arcetri nir camera arnica , equipped with a 256@xmath28256 pixel nicmos3 detector ( lisi et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ; hunt et al .",
    "the plate scale was 0.97 , 0.55 , and 0.45 arcsec pixel@xmath29 at the tirgo , not and vatt respectively .",
    "all the galaxies were observed by alternating frames on the source and on adjacent empty sky positions , integrating @xmath30 in each position .",
    "typical total integration times on source were @xmath31 in all bands , yielding ( @xmath32 ) surface magnitude limits of 20.8 , 21.3 , and 20.6 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 at the tirgo , not and vatt respectively ( hunt & mannucci 1998 ) . with a typical sky brightness of 14 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 , these limits correspond to @xmath33 % of the `` background '' .",
    "all image reduction was performed with iraf and the stsdas packages .",
    "the flat fields for each source exposure were obtained by averaging the sky frames acquired immediately before and after it , upon removal from each sky frame of eventual stars in the field .",
    "the use of medians of larger numbers of sky frames as flat fields ( `` superflats '' ) , despite their lower noise , turns out to be effective only in case of exceptional stability of the atmospheric emission . due to the high sky brightness , the requirements on flatness for mapping the outer regions of galaxies are quite strict . on average the resulting flatness",
    "( low - spatial - frequency noise only ) of our final images is about 0.01 % ( @xmath32 ) , negligible relative to the high - spatial - frequency noise which amounts to @xmath33 % as noted in sect .",
    "such image quality allows a substantial improvement in signal - to - noise of the elliptically - averaged profiles ( see sect . [ prof ] ) .",
    "the  typically four  flat - fielded source frames were subsequently cleaned for bad pixels , registered , and rescaled by an additive term to a common median level .",
    "they were then combined to obtain the median frame , after clipping deviant values in each position on the detector .",
    "the final step was the subtraction of the background , which was estimated on the source frame itself upon automatic exclusion of star and galaxy pixels .",
    ".extinction coefficients [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     [ logbk ]    all the data presented here , magnitudes , surface magnitudes , and diameters , take into account only correction for atmospheric extinction ; no correction has been applied for galactic and internal extinction nor for the effects of redshift ( k correction , and angular size - @xmath34 relation ) .",
    "a summary log of the obervations is presented in table 2 , where for each observing night : _ column 1 _ indicates the telescope used ( n for not , t for tirgo , v for vatt ) ; _ column 2 _ is the date of the following day ; _ column 3 _ is the nightly averaged zero point in the @xmath0 band ; _ column 4 _ is the @xmath32 uncertainty on the calibration as derived by the set of standard - star observations for the night ; _ column 5 _ is the average fwhm of the seeing measured on the standard - star images ; _ column 6 _ is the list of sample galaxies observed that night .",

    "yields a difference of @xmath36 mag . in neither case",
    "is a systematic difference clearly discernible .",
    "for each of the final galaxy images the coordinates of the center were determined by fitting a gaussian to the center .",

    "two magnitudes are here reported for the imaged galaxies : a total value @xmath44 and an isophotal one @xmath45 .    the total magnitude @xmath44 measures the flux contained within a circular aperture the size of the optical diameter @xmath3 . for our images",
    "this is always an extrapolated value and is computed with a procedure similar to the one outlined in gavazzi & boselli ( 1996 ) and gavazzi et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , although the values here are not corrected for extinction and redshift .",
    "we estimate the average @xmath32 accuracy of @xmath44 to be @xmath48 mag , half the error being contributed by noise and calibration and half by uncertainty in the extrapolation .    the isophotal magnitude @xmath45 is derived by integrating the surface brightness radial profile from the center out to the elliptical isophote at 21.5 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 . in some cases , due to insufficient field of view , or to a particularly noisy background , or to strong asymmetries , we were not able to fit elliptical contours down to such brightness levels .",
    "in these cases we provide an estimate of @xmath45 obtained by ( exponential ) extrapolation of the outer profile ; extrapolated values are enclosed in parenthesis and constitute roughly 10% of the total . in practice ,",
    "the extrapolation was performed by fitting a weighted linear regression to three outermost points of the surface - magnitude radial profile . in the few cases where",
    "such regression was deemed not satisfactory , the procedure was repeated with the 6 outermost points of the profile .",
    "we estimate the average @xmath32 accuracy of @xmath45 to be @xmath49 mag in case of interpolation and twice as much for the extrapolated values .",
    "again , such values are only corrected for atmospheric extinction .    as for the relation between the two types of magnitudes , we find @xmath50 , exactly what was found for the sample in gavazzi et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "the relation between the two @xmath0 magntudes is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ h_h ] , where their difference is plotted vs. the magnitude itself and vs. the average @xmath0 surface magnitude .",
    "given the already quoted accuracies for the two magnitudes , the distribution appears to consist of a normal range , for @xmath51 mag , and by a deviant tail for the higher values .",
    "such large differences are partly due to the inclusion of some faint spurious objects , such as foreground stars superimposed on the outer disk . in general",
    ", the points for the extrapolated values , that is when also @xmath45 had to be estimated by extrapolation of the brightness profile , are distributed similarly to the others , which implies that , as expected , most of the variance is contributed by @xmath44 .",
    "a significant correlation is evident between @xmath52 and @xmath45 itself ; upon inclusion of all points , the slope is @xmath53 .",
    "a similar and tighter trend is detected in the dependence on @xmath54 , the average surface magnitude within the isophotal elliptical contour at 21.5 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 ( right panel ) .",
    "such correlations are likely due to the narrow range of apparent diameters of the sample , see sect .",
    "[ select ] .",
    "this selection criterion causes the faintest galaxies to be often those with fainter surface brightness ( and lower inclination ) and , consequently , with smaller isophotal size and fainter isophotal magnitude .",
    "we conclude that the accuracy in estimating our @xmath0 magnitudes , especially the total magnitudes @xmath44 , degrades for the faintest galaxies of the sample , and that an appreciable part of the error is systematic in the sense of yielding too bright @xmath44 values for fainter @xmath45 and/or @xmath54 .",
    "such a trend spells a word of caution for the use of heavily extrapolated magnitudes in , say , distance measurements such as the tully - fisher relation .",
    "since the difference @xmath55 is ideally determined only by the outer disk , we note that , for an exponential disk with folding length @xmath56 , such difference depends only on @xmath57 , the ratio between the isophotal radius and the folding one : @xmath58\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] if @xmath44 is identified with the total , asymptotic magnitude of the disk .",

    "[ h_h ] , the dashed lines are curves of constant @xmath61 , while in the right panel they are curves of constant @xmath59 .",
    "the average ( outer ) disk appears to have an isophotal radius @xmath62 , with a central brightness @xmath63 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath1 diameter , reported in col . 7 of table 3 , is the major axis of the elliptical isophote at 21.5 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "this is provided , in arcmin , for all the objects observed in the @xmath0 band . as for the isophotal magnitudes , in some cases",
    "@xmath1 had to be measured by ( exponential ) extrapolation of the outer profile ; extrapolated values are enclosed in parenthesis .",
    "the average @xmath32 accuracy of @xmath1 is usually about 5 \" and three times worse in case of extrapolation .",
    "figure [ radii ] illustrates the comparison between our @xmath1 and the @xmath2-band @xmath3 from the rc3 . in the left panel only @xmath1 values obtained by interpolation",
    "are reported and the data set has been divided into three bins of ( optical ) axial ratio @xmath64 ; the bin boundaries are those which result in bins with equal number of objects . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the relation @xmath1 vs. @xmath3 does not deviate from linearity . as a whole",
    "we find @xmath65 , which implies that the 21.5 @xmath0-mag  arcsec@xmath9 is not as deep as the standard 25.0 @xmath2-mag  arcsec@xmath9 ; in other words , the @xmath66 colour of the outer galaxy regions is bluer , on average , than 3.5 ( see also de jong 1996 ) . as for the comparison of the different inclination bins",
    ", we find no significant difference or trend : @xmath67 for @xmath68 , @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for @xmath72 . if any , the effects of internal extinction are not noticeable on this relation , which confirms the overall transparency of the outer disk .",
    "a last comment regards the rather large scatter about the average regression with @xmath73 .",
    "this is true , and approximately constant , over the whole range of apparent size and does not depend on particularly deviant cases ; as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ radii ] , it actually remains the same upon exclusion of the extrapolated @xmath1 values .",
    "the scatter can be attributed to the different methods of measurement : an objective estimate from the elliptically averaged profile in the case of @xmath1 , and inspection of the 2d image for @xmath3 . especially in the case of late spirals , inspection of @xmath2-band plate material is strongly affected by spiral structure and by the presence of outer hii complexes . further discussion of this issue will be found in sect .",
    "[ ell_sect ] .    the ratio between the isophotal optical and nir diameters is found to be a weak function of the galaxy colour .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ color_diam ] where the ratio is plotted against the total @xmath4 index , @xmath74 .",
    "the solid curve represents an exponential disk with a central @xmath75 mag and different scale lengths in the two bandpasses ; for this special value of the central colour ( @xmath76 ) the ratio @xmath5 is equal to the scale lengths ratio , and the total colour only depends on this ratio .",
    "due to the well - known colour - magnitude relation ( tully et al .",
    "1982 ) , the dependence on colour also implies a certain dependence on the absolute luminosity ; the colour - magnitude relation for our sample is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ color_diam ] .",
    "the indicative absolute magnitudes are computed assuming a redshift distance with @xmath77 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 and upon reduction of the velocity to the local group centroid according to rc3 ( no infall correction ) ; assuming a solar absolute magnitude of 3.39 @xmath0-mag , as in gavazzi et al .",
    "( 1996b ) , the mean value of about -22.5 mag is equivalent to @xmath78 l@xmath79 .",
    "no clear correlation was instead found between @xmath5 and the apparent parameters ( magnitude , size , inclination ) so that our @xmath1 estimates appears to be generally free of measurement biases .",
    "the effective diameter @xmath46 reported in col .",
    "12 of table 3 is the major axis in arcmin of the fitted elliptical isophote containing half the flux corresponding to the total magnitude @xmath44 . the average @xmath46 uncertainty , not including the error on @xmath44 is about 2% but can be worse , up to 10% , in case of peculiarly disturbed morphologies .",
    "the concentration index @xmath10 , col .",
    "13 of table 3 , is defined as the ratio between the major axes of the elliptical isophotes enclosing 75% and 25% of the flux corresponding to @xmath45 ( gavazzi et al .",
    "we have explored the possibility of biases in the measurement of @xmath10 , by checking for correlations of the index with apparent magnitude , apparent size , and ellipticity , and found no evidence of any . as noted by gavazzi et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , @xmath10 depends on the galaxy absolute luminosity and , to a lesser degree , on morphological type ; such relations , for the present sample , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ conc_abstyp ] . as was the case also in gavazzi",
    "et al . ( 1996a ) , the highest concentration indices are found in the most luminous sb spirals",
    ". it also appears from fig .",
    "[ conc_abstyp ] that the relation between @xmath80 and nir absolute magnitude is not simply linear but definitely concave or l shaped .",
    "that is to say that , not only the mean value , but also the variance of the concentration index increases with luminosity . in fig .",
    "[ conc_abstyp ] we indicate the value of @xmath10 of a pure exponential disk : the upper value , @xmath81 is found when the 25% and 75% fractions refer to the total disk luminosity ; the lower one , @xmath82 , when the fractions refer to the luminosity within 3.5 exponential scale lengths , that is the average value corresponding to @xmath45 ( see sect .",
    "[ magnitudes ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , there is a definite tendency of the lowest luminosities and latest morphologies to conform to a pure disk but some low concentration indices are present also among the luminous , early - type objects . a more detailed study of the characteristics of the bulge and disk components of these objects is deferred to forthcoming papers .",
    "ten of the sample galaxies , that is @xmath83 6% of the total , are reported to host active nuclei , either seyferts or liners or starbursts ; they are marked with solid symbols in fig .",
    "[ conc_abstyp ] .",
    "while in the present sample they are quite luminous , there is no particular tendency to high @xmath10 values ; also the distribution among the morphological types is rather uniform but for the avoidance at @xmath84 .",

    "figure [ sb_hd ] is a scatter diagram of the average surface brightness within the 21.5 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 isophote versus @xmath45 and vs. @xmath1 .",
    "while there is a definite correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath45 , in the sense that faint surface brightnesses are preferentially observed in the faintest sample objects , it disappears almost completely between @xmath54 and @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation is therefore determined by the limited range of the selected diameters ( see sect . [ select ] ) rather than by intrinsic properties . as for the isophotal diameters ,",
    "the trend of @xmath54 with inclination is not significant .",
    "the results of the elliptical - isophote fitting have been used to compute estimates of ellipticity @xmath43 and position angle @xmath47 of the outer regions .",
    "our @xmath43 and @xmath47 values are computed directly from the output of the iraf - stsdas routine `` ellipse '' and are the weighted average of the three outermost points where the ellipticity is still evaluated with a precision better than 0.1 .",
    "the position angles are not reported for galaxies nearly face - on and particularly uncertain cases are flagged with a `` : '' .",
    "we estimate the @xmath32 uncertainty of the ellipticity to be @xmath85 , in well - behaved cases .",
    "it turns out that such a blind , although objective , procedure is often inaccurate .",
    "indeed , an inspection of the radial profiles of @xmath43 and @xmath47 in fig .",
    "4 shows that they are often determined by the geometry of the spiral pattern , which often dominates even in the nir , rather than by the effective orientation of the disk .",
    "this is true in particular for late spirals seen nearly face on and , obviously , for the more disturbed , peculiar morphologies .",
    "in addition our images have a restricted field of view and are somewhat shallower than the plates from which the optical values were estimated and therefore our estimate of the outer disk can be , in some cases , rather uncertain . as a consequence , the values we derive sometimes deviate considerably from those reported in the catalogues , which are also shown for comparison in fig .",
    "4 . a direct comparison of our ellipticities , @xmath86 , and those from the rc3 , @xmath87 , is shown in fig .",
    "as expected the scatter is rather large and not appreciably influenced by the most uncertain values ; we count 25 galaxies out of 174 for which @xmath88 .",
    "it is also quite clear that most discrepant values are found for low - inclination objects , where @xmath86 tends to be definitely larger than @xmath87 .",
    "the fact that the elliptical - isophote fitting might occasionally be misled by non - axisymmetric structure is bound to bear an influence on the parameters derived by the brightness profile .",
    "for example , a strong bar on a very tenuous disk will induce artificially high values of the ellipticity ; the result of such narrow isophotes will be larger isophotal diameters and consequently incorrect estimates of @xmath45 and @xmath10 . to check the impact of such an effect we have selected the galaxies for which our estimates of @xmath43 and @xmath47 differ most from the catalogued values and",
    "have repeated the fitting procedure by imposing on the outer regions the @xmath43 values from the rc3 . in most cases ,",
    "as expected , such optical values favour rounder images with a consequent shrinking of @xmath1 . the effect , in any case , is not dramatic and confined to less than 10% , although it reaches over 30% in the two most deviant cases : ugc 1471 and 1626 .",
    "the effect on @xmath45 is in the sense of making it brighter at lower ellipticity , but rarely exceeds the errors associated with noise and calibration .",
    "also the influence on @xmath10 is appreciable only in the worst cases and even here within 10% ; lower ellipticities tend to yield lower concentration indices .    in a certain number of cases , the isophotal fitting , although strongly influenced by non - axisymmetric structures in the inner regions , is able to recover the actual @xmath43 and @xmath47 of the outer disk .",
    "these cases ( @xmath89 ) are characterized by sudden and strong jumps in their @xmath43 and @xmath47 profiles .",
    "a good example is ugc 12039 , which has both a strong bar and strong spiral arms . as shown in fig .",
    "[ u12039 ] , the radial profiles of @xmath90 , @xmath43 , and @xmath47 all show an obvious jump at @xmath89 arcsec , that is right after the fading of the bar . in the same figure",
    "we also show the @xmath90 profile obtained by imposing a fixed @xmath43 and @xmath47 value , 0.29 and @xmath91 respectively , which are the average values for the outer regions .",
    "the influence of the bar on the derived surface brightness profile is clearly depicted , with the strongest deviations reaching @xmath92 mag . however , in these cases , the global photometric parameters ( magnitudes , diameters , indices ) estimated in the two ways are virtually identical , with differences well within the limits of the quoted accuracy . for uniformity with the rest of the sample , and",
    "given the small bearing on the global parameters , we prefer to retain also in case of strong asymmetries the fitting procedure with free @xmath43 and @xmath47 . in turn",
    "this yields the observed @xmath43 and @xmath47 profiles , together with higher order azimuthal fourier components of the luminosity distribution ( carter 1978 ) , which will be used in a forthcoming paper of this series to investigate the properties of bars and non - axisymmetric structures in general .",
    "we have presented the results of a programme of nir imaging of disk galaxies in the pisces - perseus supercluster area , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this programme constitutes the first large nir imaging survey of the supercluster and complements previous similar surveys in the coma and virgo areas .",
    "the present paper is the first of a series and contains images in the @xmath0 passband of a composite sample of 174 galaxies .    1 .   the sample galaxies , a subset of the pp supercluster galaxies , are mainly late spirals with a median @xmath93 .",
    "the sample starts lacking completeness at @xmath94 , and extends up to @xmath95 .",
    "2 .   for each galaxy",
    "we present a grey - scale image reaching an isophote of @xmath96-mag arcsec@xmath9 . for each image",
    "we supply the elliptically - averaged radial profile of the surface brightness , the ellipticity , and the position angle of the isophotes .",
    "we derive a total magnitude @xmath44 , an isophotal magnitude @xmath45 , an effective diameter @xmath46 , an isophotal one @xmath1 , the concentration index @xmath10 , and estimate the ellipticity @xmath43 and the position angle @xmath47 of the outer disk .",
    "these data , together with basic information regarding the sample objects and their observation , are collected in a single table which is available in electronic form at the cds .",
    "radial profiles in tabular form and images fits files are also available upon request .",
    "4 .   the trends of @xmath52 with @xmath45 and @xmath54",
    "imply that the average outer disk has an isophotal radius @xmath97 and a central surface brightness @xmath98 @xmath0-mag arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "the empirical relation in our sample , @xmath99 , implies that the @xmath4 color of the outer disk is bluer , on average , than 3.5 , in agreement with de jong ( 1996 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 depends , although weakly , on the total galaxy @xmath4 , and consequently on its absolute magnitude . 6 .",
    "we confirm the dependence of the ( model independent ) concentration index @xmath10 on luminosity and , to a lesser degree , on morphological type .",
    "large values for @xmath10 , that is values in excess of what is expected for pure disks ( @xmath100 ) , are preferentially observed in galaxies brighter than @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "7 .   even in the nir , objective estimates of outer ellipticities and position angles can often be contaminated by the geometry of bars and spiral patterns ; the effect is strongest for shallow images , and for low inclinations .",
    "their impact on the measurement of global photometric properties is , in any case , not dramatic .",
    "it virtually affects only @xmath1 , with discrepancies exceeding 10% only in the two worst cases .",
