    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are one of the plausible cold dark matter candidates  @xcite .",
    "wimps are stable particles which are predicted to occur in extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry .",
    "wimps undergo only weak - scale interactions with matter , and could have masses in the gev - tev range . if wimps exist , their relic abundance ( which is governed by electroweak scale interactions ) is remarkably close to the inferred density of dark matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of supersymmetric theories is the most theoretically well developed wimp candidate  @xcite .",
    "most susy theories contain a multiplicatively conserved quantum number called r - parity , where r - parity is equal to  1 for ordinary standard model particles , and is equal to  @xmath1 for their supersymmetric partners  @xcite .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , superpartners can form and decay only in pairs . thus , the lsp is stable and hence should be present in the universe as a cosmological relic from the big bang . the most likely candidate for this lsp",
    "is the neutralino  @xcite .",
    "the neutralino @xmath2 is a linear combination of the supersymmetric particles that mix after electroweak - symmetry breaking : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the supersymmetric partners of the photon and the @xmath6 boson , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the supersymmetric partners of the higgs bosons ( higgsino ) .",

    ", we perform an indirect search for wimp dark matter using the super  kamiokande detector , by looking for a high energy neutrino signal resulting from wimp annihilation in the earth , the sun , and the galactic center .",
    "the signature would be an excess of neutrino - induced events coming from the direction of these objects over the background expected from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "such a search is complementary to direct detection experiments , which look for direct interaction of wimps with a nucleus in a low background detector .",
    "however , both direct and indirect detection experiments probe the coupling of wimps to nuclei .",
    "we then compare our results with those of direct detection of dark matter experiments .",
    "if wimps constitute the dark matter in our galactic halo , they will accumulate in the sun  @xcite and the earth  @xcite .",
    "when their orbits pass though a celestial body , the wimps have a small but finite probability of elastically scattering with a nucleus of that body .",
    "if their final velocity after scattering is less than the escape velocity , they become gravitationally trapped and eventually settle into the center of that body .",
    "wimps which have accumulated this way annihilate in pairs , primarily into @xmath9 leptons , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons , depending upon their mass and composition . as the wimp density increases in the core , the annihilation rate increases until equilibrium is achieved between capture and annihilation , making the annihilation ( each of which involves two captured wimps ) rate half of the capture rate .",
    "high energy muon neutrinos are produced by the decay of the annihilation products .",
    "the expected neutrino fluxes from the capture and annihilation of wimps in the sun and the earth depend upon several astrophysical parameters : the wimp mean halo velocity ( @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 ) , the wimp local density ( @xmath15  gev  @xmath16 ) , the wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section ; and the mass and escape velocity of the celestial body .",
    "wimps undergo two kinds of interactions with the celestial bodies : axial vector interactions in which wimps couple to the spin of the nucleus ; and scalar interactions in which wimps couple to the mass of the nucleus  @xcite . for the earth",
    ", wimps mainly undergo scalar interactions , since the abundance of nuclei with odd mass number ( which are needed for spin coupling ) is extremely small  @xcite . in the sun",
    ", wimps interact through both scalar as well as axial vector interactions ( due to the large abundance of hydrogen ) .",
    "there are many calculations of the expected neutrino fluxes from wimp capture and annihilation in the sun and the earth  @xcite .",
    "it has been also pointed out that cold dark matter near the galactic center can be accreted by the central black hole resulting in a dense spike in the density distribution  @xcite .",
    "wimp annihilations in this spike would make it a compact source of high energy neutrinos .",
    "the flux of these neutrinos depends on the density profile of the inner dark matter halo .",
    "halos with isothermal or finite cores produce a negligible flux of neutrinos , while halos with inner density cusps produce an appreciable flux of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "energetic neutrinos coming from wimp annihilation in the sun , the earth , and the galactic center could be detected in neutrino detectors .",
    "the mean neutrino energy ranges from 1/3 to 1/2 the mass of the wimp , i.e. from about 5 gev to 5 tev . in this energy range ,",
    "neutrino - induced upward through - going muons from charged current interactions provide the most effective signatures in super - kamiokande .",
    "the super  kamiokande ( `` super  k '' ) detector is a 50,000  ton water cherenkov detector , located in the kamioka - mozumi mine in japan with 1000  m rock overburden . for this analysis ,",
    "super - k consisted of an inner detector with 11,146 inward - facing 50  cm photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) and an outer detector equipped with 1885 outward - facing 20  cm pmts , serving as a cosmic ray veto counter .",
    "more details about the detector can be found in ref .",
    "the data used in this analysis was taken from april 1996 to july 2001 , corresponding to 1679.6 days of detector livetime .    upward through - going muons in super ",
    "k are mainly produced by interactions of atmospheric @xmath17 in the rock around the detector and are energetic enough to cross the entire detector .",
    "the effective target volume extends outward for many tens of meters into the surrounding rock and increases with the energy of the incoming neutrino , as the high energy muons resulting from these interactions can travel longer distances to reach the detector .",
    "thus , upward through - going muons represent the highest energy portion of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum observed by super  k , and the corresponding parent neutrino energy spectrum peaks at @xmath18 100 gev  @xcite . the downward - going cosmic ray muon rate in super ",
    "k is 3  hz , making it impossible to distinguish any downward - going neutrino - induced muons from this large background of downward - going cosmic ray muons .",

    "more details of the data reduction procedure for selecting upward going muons can be found in ref .",
    "the sample described above is contaminated by some downward - going cosmic ray muons close to the horizon , which appear to be upward - going due to the tracking angular resolution of the detector and multiple coulomb scattering in the rock .",
    "the total number of such non-@xmath23 background events has been estimated to be @xmath24 , all contained in the @xmath25 bin , where @xmath26 is the zenith angle . with the 7  m path - length cut",

    "we also find that varying the oscillation parameters and choosing values corresponding to the boundaries of the 90 % confidence level allowed region does not change the flux limits within the first 20 degrees from the celestial object . only in the largest half angle cones ( half angle 30 degrees )",

    "to get limits on the wimp - nucleon cross - section for a wimp with scalar coupling , we first calculate the combined wimp flux limits from the sun and the earth as a function of wimp mass and solve the following equation to calculate the upper limit on wimp - nucleon cross - section : @xmath69 where the quantity on the left is the maximum calculated ratio of direct to indirect detection rates for a wimp with scalar coupling , and the numerator on the right hand side indicates the event rate in a direct detection experiment as a function of wimp mass and cross - section .",
    "the denominator on the right hand side is the combined super - k limit from the sun and the earth as a function of wimp mass . to obtain the combined flux limit , we first calculate the total number of observed events for each wimp mass . this is done by adding the observed number of events in the corresponding cone which contains 90% of the flux for a given mass from the sun and the earth , after scaling for their different exposures .",
    "the same procedure is used to obtain the total expected background . using this ,",
