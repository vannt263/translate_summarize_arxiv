    "so far , grbs have only been identified at cosmological distances .",
    "it is believed that grbs are caused by highly relativistic outflows with bulk lorentz factors @xmath1 that form a pair of opposite jets . even after correcting for narrow beaming ,",
    "the energy radiated by long - duration ( @xmath2 ) grbs typically is @xmath3 , and the estimated kinetic energy of the jets reaches values of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "relativistic shocks convert ( accelerate ) _ all _ particles from the incoming plasma they encounter to relativistic energies by randomizing their velocities in the comoving frame . in the stationary frame",
    "the mean energy per particle is @xmath5 @xcite",
    ". the total energy of cosmic rays ( crs ) produced by a grb can thus be up to @xmath6 times higher than the @xmath7 produced by nonrelativistic shocks of typical supernova remnants ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "grbs are prime candidate sources for the extragalactic component of crs , and they may also be sources of ultrahigh energy crs in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "calculations taking into account the star formation history and the grb beaming factor predict a galactic rate of one long grb every 3000 to @xmath8 years @xcite .",
    "a grb that occurred @xmath9 ago at @xmath10kpc from us could explain the knee in the observed cr spectrum at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "ohers have suggested that giant radio shell objects in the milky way , such as the snr w49b @xcite or kpc - size hi super - shells @xcite could be remnants of grbs .",
    "the hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) collaboration has recently discovered a population of @xmath12-ray sources in the galactic plane @xcite that are tev - bright but are often quiet in all other wavelengths and remain unidentified .",
    "all previously detected tev sources show strong x - ray emission which is the synchrotron counterpart of the inverse compton ( ic ) tev radiation from multi - tev electrons .",
    "the suppression of low - frequency flux is unexpected within conventional models .",
    "@xcite has proposed that this feature points to radiation production in the deep gravitational potential wells of black holes formed by galactic grbs",
    ". however , the extended appearance of these sources seems to contradict this explanation .",
    "the estimated rate of galactic grbs implies a likelihood of between one and several `` young '' ( age @xmath13yr ) , grb remnants in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at distances up to @xmath14 - 20kpc from us .",
    "some @xmath15 years after their acceleration by the relativistic shocks of grbs , multi - tev particles would diffuse over distances of about @xmath16pc .",
    "therefore , if detected in tev @xmath12-rays , galactic grbrs should appear as large plerionic ( ` center - filled ' ) nebulae in the ism .    while probably most of the unidentified tev sources would eventually be associated with conventional galactic objects , here we argue that at least one source , hess  j1303 - 631 @xcite , shows features that strongly suggest its identification with the remnant of a grb that happened @xmath17 years ago in our galaxy at a distance @xmath18 - 15)kpc from us .",
    "we show that this can explain both the total cr energy in the source , and its non - detection below tev energies .",
    "furthermore , we discuss observational signatures that can be used to identify grbrs unambiguously .",
    "among the unidentified tev sources discovered by hess , j1303 - 631 is the brightest source with the most detailed data @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath19-@xmath20tev differential spectrum , approximated as a power - law @xmath21 , has a mean spectral index @xmath22 and an integrated energy flux @xmath23 .",
    "so far , no emission has been detected in any other wave band , including the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the source is extended and is approximated , within current statistical errors , by a spherically symmetric 2-dimensional gaussian distribution with inherent width @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the center - filled appearance of the source and the gradual steepening of the tev spectrum suggest the emission origin from a population of high - energy particles injected into the ism from a point source and evolved by energy - dependent diffusion .",
    "absence of a detectable synchrotron flux implicitly suggests a hadronic origin of the tev radiation .",
    "since the two @xmath12-rays from a @xmath25-decay each carry a fraction of the incident proton energy of about @xmath26 , the observed flux requires @xmath27 total energy in protons with @xmath28 . here , @xmath29 is the @xmath30-cooling time , and @xmath31 is the fraction of the lost proton energy that is converted into @xmath25-mesons .",
    "substitution of the cross - section @xmath32 and the inelasticity @xmath33 gives @xmath34 here @xmath35 , and @xmath36 accounts for protons with @xmath37tev .",
    "for standard snr acceleration , a broken power - law spectrum with @xmath38 above and @xmath39 below 5tev gives the smallest possible @xmath40 .",
    "a more plausible snr spectrum with @xmath41 predicts @xmath42 .",
    "integration of the proton energy distribution formed by diffusion from a point ` impulsive ' source @xcite along the line of sight gives @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the mean diffusion length ( along each of the axes ) for a particle with energy @xmath45 , diffusion coefficient @xmath46 in a power - law approximation , and @xmath47 .",
    "integrating over a circle of angular radius @xmath48 , we derive a proton energy spectrum @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the observed spectral index @xmath50 is significantly steeper than @xmath51 - 2.2 expected for a typical snr .",
    "we explain this steepening as an unavoidable result of energy dependent diffusion .",
    "given the hess point spread function ( psf ) , the derived @xmath52 suggests @xmath53 .",
    "calculations nicely fit the data for @xmath54 , and exclude @xmath55 or @xmath56 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this defines the following key - relation between the source distance and its age @xmath57 ( we count @xmath58 from the time when the first light from the source reached us , and neglect the source expansion during the light crossing time @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 this constrains the energy required to explain both the spectral and the spatial appearance of the source : @xmath61 the diffusion coefficient in the ism should have @xmath62 to explain the cr spectral index @xmath63 .",
    "a typical value of @xmath64 at @xmath65 is @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath67 can be derived from the grammage @xmath68 that explains the observed composition of cr nuclei @xcite , and does not allow crs to stay for more than @xmath69 in the galactic disk at heights @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath72 much smaller than the typical ones for the ism would imply an enhanced level of turbulence and can be excluded , as the associated enhanced magnetic field would result in radio emission exceeding the flux upper limit derived below .    with these results",
    ", we are now in the position to argue that the source is a grbr and not a typical snr . using @xmath67 ,",
    "we constrain the source age to @xmath73 . even for a snr with @xmath74 ,",
    "an age @xmath75 , and location at @xmath76 in the ism with @xmath77 , equation ( 1 ) predicts @xmath78 . for a typical 10% cr injection efficiency by a snr",
    ", this requires a kinetic energy @xmath79 . in principle",
    ", such energies can not be excluded for some extremely powerful supernovae ( sne ) of type ib / c or iin ( which in fact might be grbs ) that constitute @xmath80 of all sne @xcite .",
    "this implies a total of @xmath81-@xmath82 such events in our galaxy .",
    "the expected number of such snrs at a distance @xmath83 is only @xmath84-@xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the non - detection of the shell of such powerful , close and young snr in the radio and x - ray bands is difficult to explain .",
    "an assumption that the source is an snr inside a molecular cloud with @xmath86 at @xmath87 @xcite relaxes the extremely high snr energy requirement and increases @xmath88 to acceptable values .",
    "however , the problem of the missing shell of this still powerful and young snr in such a dense medium persists . even for a total energy in relativistic electrons of about @xmath89 of the protons , which is a typical lower limit for an snr",
    ", the synchrotron flux would significantly exceed the flux upper limit at 5 ghz ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    for a source age of @xmath90 , equation ( [ distance ] )",
    "moves the source to @xmath91kpc and increases dramatically the energy requirements for an snr that accelerates particles by non - relativistic shocks .",
    "the full radius of the source ( detected up to @xmath92 ) increases to @xmath93 implying that it is located either in ordinary ism or _ entirely _ inside ( to have a quasi-_uniform _ profile for @xmath94 ) a giant molecular cloud .",
    "figure 2 shows the fluxes calculated for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97yr .",
    "two different proton energy spectra are considered .",
    "one implies an ` extreme snr ' , with @xmath98 at @xmath99 but @xmath100 at @xmath101 .",
    "the total energy derived is @xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "the ` grbr ' spectrum assumes @xmath104 implying protons accelerated by a relativistic shock . for qualitative estimates",
    "the break energy could be defined as @xmath105gev , where @xmath106 is the shock lorentz - factor at the time when most of the initial shock energy is transferred to relativistic protons ( see sec.3 ) .",
    "fitting the data we find @xmath107 .",
    "thus @xmath106 can be as high as the _ initial _",
    "@xmath108 of grb jets @xcite .",
    "figure 2 assumes @xmath109 .",
    "this reduces the total energy required for the grbr model to @xmath110 .",
    "values of @xmath111 , which are not excluded , would lead to an increase @xmath112 ( for @xmath113 ) , and even slower for @xmath114 .",
    "the hess collaboration discussed the giant ( @xmath115 ) molecular cloud g303.9 - 0.4 @xcite with @xmath116-@xmath117 located at 12 kpc from us as a possible host of the source . for the snr - type spectrum , the minimum cr energy @xmath118(4 - 8)@xmath119 is problematic even for a very powerful snr .",
    "furthermore , sub - relativistic protons alone would contain sufficient energy for heating ( at a rate @xmath120 ) , and possibly also disintegration , of the cloud via coulomb losses .",
    "because of the `` low - energy cutoff '' expected below @xmath121 , these constraints do not apply if hess j1303 - 631 is a grbr .",
    "it is also possible that the cloud is merely a line of sight coincidence . even at a distance of @xmath12215kpc",
    "a grbr would still be able to power the inferred proton energy density in the ism .",
    "leptonic models require less power than hadronic models .",
    "ic radiation of multi - tev electrons on the cmb and galactic far - infrared photons could reproduce the observed spectrum .",
    "a broken power - law electron spectrum with @xmath123 below 10 tev , and @xmath124 above leads to the minimum required energy @xmath125 .",
    "however , the synchrotron radio flux of the leptonic model exceeds the flux upper limit that we derived from the parkes - mit - nrao southern 4850mhz survey @xcite even for an ism magnetic field @xmath126 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we estimate the limit by measuring a mean flux of 0.0032 jy / beam in the @xmath127 radius region centered on the source . calculating the flux in background regions of the same aperture",
    ", we estimate a standard deviation of 0.0033 jy / beam . using a beam width of @xmath128 fwhm ,",
    "we then obtain a 5@xmath129 upper limit of 0.12jy on the flux from within @xmath127 from the source centroid .",
    "we have also computed the ic fluxes from the secondary @xmath130-decay electrons and from @xmath131-decay electrons @xcite , accounting also for their radiative energy losses .",
    "both fluxes are almost two orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath132-decay flux .",
    "the ratio of synchrotron to ic fluxes depends only on the ratio of the magnetic field to the target photon energy densities .",
    "hence the radio flux from the secondary electrons for the grbr model in figure 2 does not violate the derived upper limit in so far as their ic emission is well below the observed tev flux .",
    "a grbr should differ from a snr not only by the energetics , but also by three characteristics of its relativistic particle population .",
    "first , the prompt differential spectrum of protons ( and electrons ) behind the relativistic shock can not be a single power - law @xmath133 with @xmath134 as in the case of nonrelativistic shocks . as shocks with lorentz - factor @xmath135 boost _ all _ particles they encounter to relativistic energies",
    ", the prompt spectrum should break to an index @xmath136 below some energy @xmath137 ( observer frame ) to satisfy the laws of energy and particle number conservation across the shock @xcite . the final power - law index @xmath138 ( presumably @xmath139 ) and the break energy @xmath121 are formed while the shock decelerates , and will depend on a number of processes , such as diffusive escape of relativistic protons from the shell , their adiabatic cooling and reacceleration , etc . at @xmath140 a spectral index @xmath141",
    "is expected to form in fermi - type processes @xcite . for the current data",
    ", @xmath121 could be as high as 5tev ( in figure 2 ) , but it could also be smaller , leading to gev @xmath12-ray fluxes detectable by glast .",
    "the second feature of grbrs that we predict is that a substantial fraction of the initial shock energy is eventually transferred to high - energy protons , while relativistic electrons would contain only a tiny fraction of it at times of non - relativistic evolution of the grbr shell .",
    "a grb shock becomes non - relativistic , and also quasi - spherical , on timescales @xmath142 at distances @xmath143 @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "magnetic fields of @xmath144 @xcite are still high and will ( synchrotron ) cool electrons to a few gev within @xmath1451yr . as the initial kinetic energy (",
    "5 - 10)@xmath146 of the jets is much larger than the radiated ( and the magnetic field s ) energy , by then most of it should be in relativistic protons .",
    "the evolution of a non - relativistic shell that is dominated by the relativistic energy , and not by the kinetic energy of the shock , requires a fully relativistic treatment and remains unexplored .",
    "diffusion of relativistic protons ( thus escaping adiabatic losses ) upstream may broaden the shock precursor .",
    "because of the preferential acceleration of particles with lorentz factors larger than the precursor @xcite , energetic protons will readily be accelerated while acceleration of electrons will be suppressed .",
    "this would also apply to the spherical `` supernova''-type component ( which , however , may not be developed by grbs at all , see @xcite ) as this non - relativistic shock has to pass through the central @xmath147 region dominated by the energy of relativistic protons from the ( quasi - spherically opened up ) grb jets .",
    "we also note that in the presence of relativistic protons , nonrelativistic shocks may evolve ( and dissipate ) much faster than predicted by the standard sedov - taylor solution for snr shocks propagating in `` cold '' plasmas @xcite .",
    "third , considerable energy , @xmath148-@xmath149 , of the accelerated protons is channeled into collimated beams of neutrons @xcite from interactions @xmath150 with x - ray photons from the grb .",
    "first , this mechanism assures a minimum level of total energy of the protons that avoid adiabatic losses in the shell , @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , neutrons with energies @xmath152 will @xmath131-decay into protons on length scales of @xmath153 . a characteristic signature of a grbr",
    "might then be an elongation of the tev @xmath12-ray emission due to conversion of the initial double - sided neutron beam into protons , which will subsequently be injected into the diffusion process along the jet path on length scales @xmath154-@xmath155 ( for @xmath156 ) .",
    "depending on the contribution of neutrons to the high - energy proton population , the two - dimensional gaussian profile may have an aspect ratio of up to @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 . for a source size",
    "@xmath160 this would predict @xmath161 - 0.1 ) .",
    "however , neutron beams can also affect the shape of the grbr nebula indirectly via driving ( after @xmath131-decay ) the ism , and stretching the ambient magnetic field , along the jet direction @xcite .",
    "a faster diffusion of the bulk of protons in this direction could result in @xmath162 .",
    "remarkably , in both cases the aspect ratio should increase at higher energies .",
    "the hess collaboration determined the source spectrum with the photons from the bright central part of the source ( within 13.4@xmath163 from the centre ) .",
    "while our model explains this spectrum , it predicts that the energy spectrum will be significantly harder when determined for the entire source ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "another specific signature of a grbr is the unusually hard energy spectrum at @xmath164 - 100gev .",
    "glast will be able to verify or falsify this prediction .",
    "if hess  j1303 - 631 is a snr , glast will easily detect the source at the flux level close to the upper limit of egret @xcite .",
    "however , a weak detection ( confirming the hard spectrum ) or non - detection by glast would signify the tell - tale detection of the signatures of proton acceleration by relativistic shocks of a grb .",
    "confirmation of hess j1303 - 631 and at least one other extended unidentified tev source , such as tev j2032 + 4130 @xcite , as grbrs would confirm the high rate , of order @xmath165 , of galactic grbs , and would make it more likely that grbs had a direct impact on life on earth @xcite .",
