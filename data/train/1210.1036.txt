    "when @xmath15 is a ( classical ) tilting module ( which always has the same number of non - isomorphic indecomposable direct summands as @xmath3 ) , there is an associated torsion pair @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and the interplay between tilting modules and torsion pairs has played a central role .",
    "another important fact is that an almost complete tilting module @xmath18 can be completed in at most two different ways to a tilting module @xcite .",

    "this fact , and its generalization to 2-calabi - yau triangulated categories @xcite , plays an important role in the categorification of cluster algebras . in the case of cluster categories ,",
    "this can be reformulated in terms of the path algebra @xmath22 as follows @xcite : a @xmath3-module @xmath15 is _ support tilting _ if @xmath15 is a tilting @xmath23-module for some idempotent @xmath24 of @xmath3 . using the more general class of support tilting modules , it holds for path algebras that almost complete support tilting modules can be completed in exactly two ways to support tilting modules .",
    "the above result for path algebras does not necessarily hold for a finite dimensional algebra .",
    "the reason is that there may be sincere modules which are not faithful .",
    "we are looking for a generalization of tilting modules where we have such a result , and where at the same time some of the essential properties of tilting modules still hold .",

    "also there is a naturally associated quiver , where the isomorphism classes of tilting modules are the vertices .",
    "there is a generalization of classical tilting modules to tilting modules of finite projective dimension @xcite .",

    "a motivation for considering the problem of exactly two complements for almost complete support @xmath0-tilting modules was that the condition of @xmath0-rigid module appears naturally when we express @xmath48 for @xmath27 and @xmath49 objects in a 2-cy category @xmath6 in terms of corresponding modules @xmath50 and @xmath51 over an associated 2-cy tilted algebra ( proposition [ thm3.3 ] ) .",

    "<S> an important property in cluster tilting theory is that an almost complete cluster - tilting object in a 2-cy triangulated category is a direct summand of exactly 2 cluster - tilting objects . </S>",

    "<S> we generalize ( support ) tilting modules to what we call ( support ) @xmath0-tilting modules , and show that an almost complete support @xmath0-tilting module has exactly two complements for any finite dimensional algebra .    for a finite dimensional @xmath1-algebra @xmath3 , we establish bijections between functorially finite torsion classes in @xmath4 , support @xmath0-tilting modules and two - term silting complexes in @xmath5 . </S>",
