    "the spin-@xmath2 bilinear - biquadratic model ( sbbm)@xmath3 \\label{h0}%\\ ] ] was put forward long time ago @xcite , where @xmath4 is the spin-@xmath2 operator . in one dimension ,",
    "the phase diagram was established @xcite , but there are still some controversies @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram in two dimensions and above may be simpler because of suppression of quantum fluctuations .",
    "generally speaking , there are two regimes exhibiting different types of spin nematic orders : ( 1 ) the ferro - nematic phase for @xmath5 ( 2 ) the antiferro - nematic phase for @xmath6 .",
    "recently the first regime with ferro - quadruple long - range order ( lro ) attracts much attention due to the fact that the mott insulating state was realized in a system of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "here we shall study the second regime by a bond - operator mean - field theory in su(@xmath7 ) bosons representation .",
    "the unconventional properties of this nematic state , such as the absence of magnetic lro and the gapless excitation , are quite instructive for explaining recent experimental observations in niga@xmath0s@xmath1 @xcite .    in a framework of frustrated su(@xmath8 ) model , we expressed the sbbm in terms of su(@xmath7 ) generators and proposed an associated bond - operator mean - field theory in both bosonic and fermionic representations @xcite .",
    "the theory is a generalization of the widely used schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the theory is that we can use it to study either the ordered or disordered phases . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the bosonic theory to study the unconventional orders of the antiferro - nematic states on the triangular lattice .",
    "it will be shown that the ferro- and antiferro - quadruple lro s may coexist at low temperature for the quadruple operators , which is reminiscent of the ferrimagnets or the canted antiferromagnets . and",
    "the uniform quadruple moments may keep nonzero at finite temperatures .",
    "these two new features enrich our knowledge of the antiferro - nematic state of this model . to show the relevance of this state to the observations in niga@xmath0s@xmath1 , we also calculate the physical quantities , e.g. the ground energy , the specific heat , and the uniform magnetic susceptibility .",
    "a similar theory with a different scheme had been applied to the ferro - nematic phase by one of the authors in a previous work @xcite .",
