    "an integrated approach is introduced to study the free flight of insects ( e.g. dragonflies)(dong et al .",
    "first , high - speed photogrammetry is used to record various flight motions . as an example",
    ", a dragonfly in a backward taking - off is shown in the video .",
    "three - dimensional surface reconstruction techniques are then applied to obtain the data of body trajectory , wing kinematics and deformation .",
    "based on these data , direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of full body is conducted with our in - house high fidelity cfd solver , which is based on sharp interface immerse boundary method ( mittal et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the vortex structure created in the process of dragonfly taking - off can be clearly seen . as a further step , tracers and lagrangian coherent structure ( shadden et al .",
    "2005 ) are used to understand the vortex formation and facilitate the vortex identification .",
