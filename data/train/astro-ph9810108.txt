    "a gas of massive fermions , interacting only gravitationally , has interesting thermal properties that may have important consequences in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles for such a system have been shown to have a non - trivial thermodynamical limit @xcite . under certain conditions , these systems will become unstable and undergo a phase transition that is accompanied by gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this phase transition occurs only in the case of the attractive gravitational interaction of neutral particles obeying fermi - dirac statistics : it neither happens in the case of the repulsive coulomb interaction of charged fermions @xcite , nor does it in the case of the attractive gravitational interaction , when the particles obey bose - einstein or maxwell - boltzmann statistics . to be specific",
    ", we henceforth assume that this neutral fermion is the heaviest neutrino , which is presumably the @xmath1 , although this is not essential for most of the subsequent discussion , as this neutral fermion could also be replaced with a light gravitino in supergravity models with low supersymmetry breaking scales @xcite .",
    "we will , moreover , assume that the weak interaction can be neglected .",
    "the ground state of a gravitationally condensed neutrino cloud , with mass below the oppenheimer - volkoff ( ov ) limit @xcite , where it is close to being a black hole , is a cold neutrino star @xcite , in which the degeneracy pressure balances the gravitational attraction of the neutrinos . degenerate stars of neutrinos in the mass range between @xmath2 = 10 and 25 kev@xmath3 are particularly interesting @xcite , as they could explain , without resorting to the black hole hypothesis , at least some of the features observed around the supermassive compact dark objects , which are reported to exist at the centres of a number of galaxies @xcite , including our own @xcite , and quasi - stellar objects ( qso ) @xcite . in fact , the upper bound for the mass of a neutrino star is given by the ov limit @xmath4 , where @xmath5 = 1.22205 @xmath6 gev/@xmath7 is the planck mass and @xmath8 the spin degeneracy factor of the neutrinos and antineutrinos ( i.e.  @xmath9 for majorana or @xmath10 for dirac neutrinos and antineutrinos ) .",
    "the radius of such a compact dark object would be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the schwarzschild radius of the mass @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there is thus little difference between a neutrino star at the ov limit and a supermassive black hole of the same mass , a few schwarzschild radii away from the object , as the last stable orbit around a black hole has a radius of 3 schwarzschild radii anyway . for non - relativistic neutrino stars that are well below the ov limit , mass and radius scale as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "for instance , the purported supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath15 at the centre of our galaxy could well be a neutrino star with 2.6 @xmath16 10@xmath17 solar masses and a few tens of light - days radius @xcite .",
    "the existence of a quasi - stable neutrino in this mass range is ruled out neither by particle and nuclear physics experiments nor by direct astrophysical observations @xcite . on the contrary , if the lsnd experiment is actually observing @xmath18 oscillations @xcite , and the quadratic see - saw mechanism involving the up , charm and top quarks , is the correct explanation for the smallness of the neutrino masses @xcite , we should expect the @xmath1 mass between 6 kev/@xmath7 and 32 kev/@xmath7 . in such a scenario ,",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 masses would be about 10@xmath21 and 1ev , respectively , and the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies would have to be interpreted as vacuum oscillations into two different sterile neutrinos , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with masses slightly different from those of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , consistent with the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences .",
    "large neutrino - antineutrino asymmetries could suppress potentially disastrous active - sterile neutrino oscillations prior to nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the mixing angles for active - sterile neutrino oscillations involving the same flavor would be maximal , while the mixing matrix elements corresponding to flavor oscillations would be very small and exhibit a hierarchical pattern similar to that of the ckm matrix of the quark sector .",
    "the smallness of the masses of the sterile neutrinos @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 could be guaranteed by an additional see - saw mechanism in the sterile sector @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a neutrino mass of between 10 kev / c@xmath0 and 25 kev / c@xmath0 which is in the so - called cosmologically forbidden region given by 93 @xmath25 ev/@xmath26 4 gev/@xmath7 , where 0.4 @xmath27 1 is the hubble parameter , is unacceptable , as it would lead to an early neutrino - matter dominated phase some time after nucleosynthesis and prior to recombination @xcite .",
    "in such a universe , the microwave background temperature would be attained much too early to accommodate the oldest stars in globular clusters , nuclear cosmochronometry , and the hubble expansion age , if the standard model of cosmology is correct .",
    "however , the early universe might have evolved quite differently , in the presence of such a heavy neutrino . in particular",
    ", it is conceivable that primordial neutrino stars have been formed in local condensation processes during a gravitational phase transition that must have occurred some time after the nonrelativistic heavy neutrinos started to dominate this universe , a few weeks after the big bang . aside from reheating the gaseous phase of the heavy neutrinos",
    ", the latent heat produced during the phase transition might have contributed partly to reheating the radiation as well . moreover ,",
    "the bulk part of the heavy neutrinos ( and antineutrinos ) will have annihilated efficiently into light neutrinos via the @xmath28 in the dense interior of these supermassive neutrino stars @xcite . in this context , it is interesting to note that , even within the ( homogeneous ) standard model of cosmology , the reason why neutrino masses larger than 4 gev@xmath3 are again cosmologically allowed , is precisely that the annihilation of the heavy neutrinos into light neutrinos reduces the matter content of the universe . since both these processes , reheating and annihilation , will increase the age of the universe , or postpone the time when the universe reaches the current microwave background temperature @xcite",
    ", it does not seem excluded that a quasistable massive neutrino in the mass range between 10 and 25 kev is compatible with cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the formation of such a neutrino star as a consequence of a thermodynamical instability during a first - order gravitational phase transition . for simplicity , we assume that the neutrino star will be sufficiently below the ov limit , so that we can treat this process non - relativistically @xcite",
    ". the general - relativistic extension of the thomas - fermi model has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the effects of general relativity become important only if the total rest - mass of the system is close to the ov limit @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath29 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath30 where the number density of the @xmath31 neutrinos ( including antineutrinos ) of mass @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of the fermi - dirac distribution at a finite temperature @xmath32 as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the fermi function @xmath35 and @xmath36 the chemical potential .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the normalized reduced potential @xmath37 @xmath38 being the solar mass , and the dimensionless variable @xmath39 with the scale factor @xmath40    & = & 2.1377\\;\\;{\\rm lyr } \\left ( \\frac{17.2\\;\\;{\\rm kev } } { m_{\\nu }          c^{2 } } \\right)^{8/3 } g_{\\nu}^{-2/3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , equation ( 1 ) takes the simple form @xmath41 where we have introduced the normalized inverse temperature @xmath42 , with @xmath43 . in equation ( 6 ) we recover , at zero temperature , the well - known lan - emden differential equation @xcite @xmath44    the solution of the differential equation ( 6 ) requires boundary conditions .",
    "we assume here that the neutrino gas is enclosed in a spherical cavity of radius @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 .",
    "we further require the total neutrino mass to be @xmath47 , and we allow for the possibility of a pointlike mass @xmath48 at the origin , which could be , e.g. , a compact seed of baryonic matter .",
    "@xmath49 is then related to its derivative at @xmath50 by @xmath51 which , in turn , is related to the chemical potential by @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath49 at @xmath53 is given by the point mass at the origin , i.e.  @xmath54 .",
    "similarly to the case of the lan - emden equation , it is easy to show that equation ( 6 ) has a scaling property : if @xmath49 is a solution of equation ( 6 ) at a temperature @xmath32 and a cavity radius @xmath45 , then @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , is also a solution at the temperature @xmath57 and the cavity radius @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to note that only those solutions that minimize the free energy are physical .",
    "the free - energy functional is defined as @xcite , @xmath59 = \\mu[n_{\\nu } ] n_{\\nu } - w[n_{\\nu } ] - ktg_{\\nu } \\int \\frac{d^{3 } rd^{3 } p}{(2 \\pi           \\hbar)^{3 } } \\times & & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath60}{kt } + \\frac{\\mu[n_{\\nu}]}{kt } \\right ) \\right ] , & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 = -gm^{2}_{\\nu } \\int d^{3 } r ' \\frac{n_{\\nu}(r')}{|\\vec{r } - \\vec{r}'|},\\ ] ] and @xmath62 = - \\frac{1}{2 } gm_{\\nu}^{2 } \\int d^{3 } rd^{3 } r ' \\frac{n_{\\nu}(r ) n_{\\nu}(r')}{|\\vec{r } - \\vec{r}'|}.\\ ] ] the chemical potential in equation ( 9 ) varies with density , so that the number of neutrinos @xmath63 is kept fixed .",
    "all the relevant thermodynamical quantities , such as number density , pressure , free energy , energy , and entropy , can be expressed in terms of @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    @xmath69",
    "we now turn to the numerical study of a system of self - gravitating massive neutrinos with an arbitrarily chosen total mass @xmath70 , varying the cavity radius @xmath45 . owing to the scaling properties ,",
    "the system may be rescaled to any physically interesting mass . for definiteness ,",
    "the @xmath1 mass is chosen as @xmath2 = 17.2 kev@xmath3 which is about the central value of the mass region between 10 and 25 kev@xmath3 @xcite , that is interesting for our scenario . in figure 1 ,",
    "our results for a gas of neutrinos in a cavity of radius @xmath71 are presented .",
    "we find three distinct solutions in the temperature interval @xmath72 ; of these only two are physical solutions , namely , those for which the free energy assumes a minimum .",
    "the density distributions corresponding to such two solutions are shown in the first plot in figure 1 .",
    "the solution that can be continuously extended to any temperature above the mentioned interval is referred to as `` gas '' , whereas the solution that continues to exist at low temperatures and eventually becomes a degenerate fermi gas at @xmath73 is referred to as `` condensate '' . in figure 1",
    ", we also plot various extensive thermodynamical quantities ( per neutrino ) as functions of the neutrino temperature .",
    "the phase transition takes place at a temperature @xmath74 , where the free energy of the gas and of the condensate become equal .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath75 is indicated by the dotted line in the free - energy plot .",
    "the top dashed curve in the same plot corresponds to the unphysical solution . at @xmath76",
    "the energy and the entropy exhibit a discontinuity , and thus there will be a substantial release of latent heat during the phase transition .",
    "an important and currently still open question is , how and to which type of matter or radiation this latent heat , which can be interpreted as the binding energy of the neutrino stars , will be transferred .",
