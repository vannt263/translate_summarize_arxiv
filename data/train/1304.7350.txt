    "[ diagram](c ) , for high values of @xmath65 as elucidated in the fig .",
    "[ finter ] , it is expected to lie close to this arrangement which explains the origin of lower @xmath10 to the left of fig .",

    "though modeling real brain networks needs to account for more properties such as specific degree distribution , hierarchical structure etc , which may bring upon a richer largest eigenvalue pattern @xcite , an impact of i nodes impels a drastic change in its spectral properties illustrating extreme events which has been envisaged upon in this paper .",
