    "the study of ratchet effects in superconductors has attracted great interest in recent years due to the possibility of controlling vortex motion @xcite . however , only very recently nano - micro engineering has allowed to successfully fabricate different types of asymmetric pinning potentials for the motion of flux quanta .",
    "voltage rectification was spectacularly observed in nb films with a triangular dots array of pinning potential @xcite and in al films with square arrays of hole pinning sites @xcite .",
    "ratchet effect has also been analyzed theoretically and experimentally in josephson junctions arrays ( jja ) , both in the classical and quantum regime , particularly for the cases of 1d parallel jja , squid s or circular arrays @xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid however to larger two dimensional jja , where collective effects are expected to play an important role . indeed , this collective behavior was very recently observed in experiments with large square jja @xcite . in this case ,",
    "improved e - lithography techniques were used to modulate the gap between the superconducting islands and thus an asymmetric and periodic sawtooth potential for the vortex - antivortex motion was generated .",
    "voltage rectification was then clearly observed under an applied ac current ( rocking ratchet ) , and analyzed as a function of the vortex density . in this paper",
    "we show that the main experimental results reported in @xcite can be successfully reproduced and analyzed in detail by numerical simulations of the overdamped rsj model for a large 2d jja with asymmetrically modulated critical currents .",
    "we study the dynamics of asymmetrically modulated 2d jja using the resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model for the sns ( superconductor - normal - superconductor ) junctions in square two dimensional arrays @xcite .",
    "the current flowing in the junction between two superconducting islands is the sum of the josephson supercurrent and the normal current ( see details of the model in @xcite ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the critical current of the junction between the sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a square lattice [ @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the normal state resistance and @xmath9 is the gauge invariant phase difference with @xmath10 being @xmath11 the flux quantum .",
    "the langevin noise term @xmath12 models the contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath13 and satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "the asymmetry in the underlying periodic pinning potential is introduced by modulating the critical currents @xmath3 , and therefore the josephson coupling energy between islands @xmath15 .",
    "experimentally , the ratchet potential is generated by modulating the gap between the superconducting islands , @xmath16 , as a sawtooth with a given period , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "for sns junctions , the coupling energy decrease exponentially with @xmath16 : @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 being the coherence length in the normal metal . in our model",
    "we make a simplification in order to modulate the energy couplings through the critical currents .",
    "we consider a sawtooth modulation of @xmath20 where @xmath21 which increases linearly from @xmath22 to @xmath23 with each period @xmath17 .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath24 perpendicular to the sample is applied , such that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the vortex density and @xmath27 is the array lattice spacing .",
    "in addition , we apply an external ac driving , @xmath28 in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "the dynamical equations for the superconducting phases are obtained after considering conservation of the current in each node ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting set of langevin equations are solved using a second - order runge - kutta algorithm with time step @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and time integration ranges @xmath32 after the transient . under ac external currents applied perpendicularly to the sawtooth modulation ,",
    "the current - voltages characteristics are calculated as well as the vortex structure .",
    "the normalization used is the following : currents by @xmath3 , voltages by @xmath33 , temperature by @xmath34 and frequencies by @xmath35 .",
    "we study the vortex rectification on ratchet - like square ( @xmath36 ) jja , with period @xmath37 and linear modulated critical currents between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a wide range of magnetic field was explored , from the one corresponding to only one vortex in the system ( @xmath40 ) to very high vortex densities .",
    "we use system sizes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "it is well known that the velocity of an overdamped particle under an applied ac force can be rectified by introducing a periodic potential with broken reflection symmetry .",
    "we can thus ask whether this effect , known as rocking ratchet , can be still observed for the motion of interacting vortices in a modulated 2d jja . since vortex velocity is proportional to voltage",
    ", this kind of ratchet effect would be observable as a voltage rectification . in fig.[fig",
    ": ivs ] we show clear evidence of the latter effect , i.e a net directional vortex motion under the applied ac - drive of zero mean . we see that mean dc voltage , @xmath43 , as a function of @xmath44 presents a maximum for an optimal value of @xmath44 and decreases slowly with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "this is the qualitative behavior expected for the one particle rocking ratchet . to study the role of the vortex interactions in fig.[fig : ivs](a ) examples for different vortex densities are presented , @xmath45 .",
    "a decrease in the maximum rectification is seen while the vortex density increases as well as a shift to higher optimal ac amplitude .",
    "an important feature is worthy of being mentioned here ( see inset in fig.1(a ) ) : the voltage rectification is highly negligible when only one single vortex is present in the system , corresponding to a vortex density @xmath46 in this case .",
    "a more intriguing feature appears when the vortex density is further increased .",
    "examples are shown in fig.[fig : ivs](b ) .",
    "for instance , an inversion of the vortex flow direction is observed .",
    "these observations provide evidence for the relevant role of vortex interactions . also notice the expected reflection symmetry around @xmath0 due to the symmetries with the magnetic field of the hamiltonian representing jja @xcite . from @xmath47",
    "to @xmath0 the dissipation arises from the motion of `` positive '' vortices .",
    "the opposite occurs for @xmath1 between @xmath0 to @xmath48 where a flux of negative vortices ( antivortices ) gives a voltage response of opposite sign .",

    "a plateau of saturation is obtained for very low frequencies ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : se](a ) we show that our main results at high vortex density ( @xmath56 ) are independent of system size .",
