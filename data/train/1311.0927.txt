    "it is well - known that the standard notion of entropy for an action of a locally compact compactly generated topological group @xmath4 by measure - preserving transformations assigns zero value to any smooth action unless the group @xmath4 is virtually cyclic , i.e. a compact extension of @xmath3 ( notice that , in particular , @xmath5 is a compact extension of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the reason is very simple : entropy of a group action measures in some way the exponential growth of the number of distinguishable orbit segments against the size or the volume of , say , a ball in the word - length metric or some left - invariant metric in the acting group while for the smooth ( or lipschitz ) actions this number growth no faster than exponentially against the radius of that ball .",

    "change the normalization and measure exponential growth against the radius of the ball .",
    "this leads to the slow entropy type invariants as in @xcite .",
    "2 .   consider an average exponential growth , represented by the ordinary entropy , along one - parameter subgroups , or , more generally , `` directions '' in the group ; for higher - rank abelian groups this was done by d. fried @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we only consider actions of higher rank abelian groups , more specifically , @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , for the general discussion it is sufficient to consider actions of @xmath7 . a standard suspension construction allows to reduce actions of @xmath0 , or , more generally , @xmath6 to this case .",
    "let us fix a volume element in @xmath7 ; in the suspension case a natural volume element comes from @xmath0",
    ". for @xmath7 actions the group of automorphisms preserving the volume element and orientation is naturally @xmath8 ; for @xmath0 actions the group automorphisms is @xmath9 .",
    "if the orientation is not fixed , one takes corresponding two - point extensions of those groups .    a notion of entropy for @xmath7-actions in order to be useful in the smooth case should be :    1 .",
    "invariant under volume preserving automorphisms of @xmath7;. ] 2 .",

    "positive if entropy of all non - identity elements of the action is positive ; 4 .",
    "finite for smooth actions on compact manifolds with respect to any borel probability invariant measure .",
    "d. fried @xcite suggested a notion of entropy for actions of higher rank abelian groups satisfying these properties , based on the averaging approach ( 2 ) .",
    "we discuss this notion in section  [ sectionfried ] . for @xmath0 actions one can also define entropy type invariant for any rank between @xmath11 and @xmath12 based on fried s approach , see definition  [ k - entropy ] .    a notion based on the slow entropy approach ( 1 )",

    "while in the fried definition the invariance property ( i ) is automatic , in the slow entropy approach it is only achieved by minimization over a class of norms in the acting group that of course makes calculations more difficult .",

    "we use sophisticated number - theoretic tools to show that the fried average entropy ( definition  [ friedentropy ] ) of such actions is bounded from below by a positive constant , obtain a good below estimate for that constant , and calculate the minimal value that is conjecturally achieved for a certain @xmath16 action on @xmath17 ; see the first line of table 2 .",
    "furthermore , the lower bound grows exponentially with the rank of a cartan action , see theorem  [ fried - entropy - bound ] .",
    "we also obtain lower bounds ( polynomial and exponential ) for many ( but not all ) intermediate entropies ( propositions  [ l - ent ] and [ mahler - exp ] ) .",
    "an exponential bound for the remaining case is formulated as conjecture  [ conj - exp ] .",
    "the reason for particular attention we pay to cartan actions is that they and their minor modifications provide the only models of @xmath13 actions with positive fried average entropy on @xmath18-dimensional manifolds for @xmath15 .",
    "this is proved in @xcite and is quoted below as theorem  a. thus our estimates of the fried average entropy and intermediate entropies are universal for weakly mixing actions of @xmath13 on @xmath18-dimensional manifolds , @xmath15 with positive fried average entropy , see corollary  [ corollarymain ] .    in section  [ sbsslowcartan ]",
    "we calculate our automorphism invariant slow entropy for cartan actions .",
    "our main conclusion ( theorem  [ slow - entropy - bounds ] ) is that it is uniquely determined by the dimension and the value of the fried average entropy .",
    "moreover , it is uniformly bounded away from zero .",
    "again the measure rigidity theorem  a implies that the same is true for any weakly mixing action of @xmath13 with positive slow entropy on an @xmath18-dimensional manifold for @xmath15 .",
    "dropping the weak mixing assumption that in our situation is equivalent to the absence of periodic factors , allows to construct examples with arbitrary small but positive fried average entropy and slow entropy , albeit on manifolds of increasing complexity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 7 ) .",
