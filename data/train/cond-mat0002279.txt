    "there have recently been a number of suggestions for a quantum computer architecture that use quantum dots of varying kinds@xcite .",
    "if these schemes are to be practical many important physical questions need to be answered , one of which is how to readout physical properties such as charge or spin at a single electron level@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a quantum trajectory analysis of a general scheme to readout a single electronic qubit using a single electron transistor ( set ) .",
    "we adopt a general phenomenological description of the set in which the tunneling rate through the set is conditioned on the occupation or otherwise of a nearby quantum dot .",
    "we consider two spatially separated quantum dots which are strongly coupled so that delocalized states of their relevant degrees of freedom can form . to be specific",
    ", we imagine each dot to have a single electronic bound state that can be occupied .",
    "thus the average occupation number of each dot must be less than unity .",
    "this restriction can easily be removed to account for spin , or multiple electron states .",
    "we label each dot with an index @xmath0 and let @xmath1 represent the fermi annihilation and creation operators for each single electron state ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the two dots are strongly coupled via the tunnel coupling hamilton @xmath2 thus the total hamiltonian of the two - dot system is @xmath3 in what follows we will work in an interaction picture and assume that the energies of each bound state are equal ( again this can be relaxed ) .",
    "coulomb blockade effects have been ignored at this stage , but can easily be included without significantly changing the results of this paper .",
    "the single particle eigenstates of this hamiltonian are even and odd superpositions of the bare states of each well .",
    "such states are thus delocalized over the two - dot system and are sometimes called molecular states in the literature@xcite .",
    "the localized states can then be represented as an even and odd superposition of the delocalized states .",
    "the localized states are not stationary ; rather , the system will periodically oscillate between them .",
    "that is to say the system will tunnel coherently between the two dots .    to this coherent system",
    "we add a measurement device which determines the presence of an electron on one of the dots , say dot @xmath4 , which we shall refer to as the target ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the model is based on a set tunnel junction containing a single bound state on the island .",
    "the interaction between the target and the set is via a coulomb blockade .",
    "thus the interaction hamiltonian between the set and the target must commute with the target electron number operator , @xmath5 .",
    "this makes it a qnd ( quantum nondemolition measurement ) of electron number@xcite .",
    "the coulomb blockade changes the current flowing through the set . in simple terms",
    "if there is no electron on the target the island state is biased so as to allow little or no current to flow though the set .",
    "this is the quiescent state of the set .",
    "however when there is an electron on the target , the coulomb blockade shifts the bound state on the island to allow a greater current to flow through the device ( see figure [ fig2 ] )    we derive a master equation to describe the behaviour of the target system .",
    "this master equation describes the unconditional evolution of the measured system when the results of all measurement records ( that is current records ) are averaged over .",
    "this will tell us the rate at which coherence in the target system is destroyed by the measurement .",
    "however we also need to know how the system state depends on the actual current through the device in order to determine how quickly the conditional state of the electron becomes localized which is measure of the quality of the measurement .",
    "one approach to this problem is to keep track of many different states of the system , corresponding to the different numbers of electrons which have tunneled through the set .",
    "this is the approach used for example in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we adopt an alternate method which gives a more intuitive picture for the conditional dynamics .",
    "we use a conditional _ stochastic _ master equation which gives the evolution of the measured system , conditioned on a particular realization of the measured current .",
    "the instantaneous state of the target conditions the measured current while the measured current itself conditions the future evolution of the measured system in a self consistent manner .",
    "this approach to measurements has been variously called the quantum trajectory method @xcite or quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "consider a two dot system with the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ tunnel ] ) .",
    "if the electron is in dot-2 the quiescent rate of current tunneling though the set is a constant which we will denote @xmath6 .",
    "however if there is an electron on dot-1 , the rate of tunneling through the set changes to @xmath7 with @xmath8 . if @xmath6 does not equal zero then a current spike ( resulting from a tunnel event in the set ) does not necessarily imply that the electron in the measured system is in dot-1 . in an ideal device the quiescent tunneling rate ,",
    "@xmath6 is zero . in reality",
    "johnson noise on the circuit containing the set will give a non - zero quiescent tunneling current .",
    "assuming that the set island state can be adiabatically eliminated , it is possible to derive a master equation for the state of the coupled dot system .",

    "it is easy to verify that the stationary solution of this master equation is an equal mixture of the two accessible electronic states .",
    "the stochastic record of measurement ideally comprises a sequence of times , being the times at which electrons tunneled through the set . in practice of course these events are not seen due to a finite frequency response of the circuit ( including the set ) which averages each event over some time .",
    "however for the purpose of this paper we will take the zero response time limit . in this limit",

    "of course this measurement time scale is necessarily at least as large as the decoherence time scale because successfully distinguishing between the two dots would by definition destroy any coherence between them .",

    "if we average over the noise , the ensemble dynamics is then seen to be given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 $ ] denotes the averaging over the ensemble of conditional states .",
    "these equations are exactly what would be obtained directly from the ensemble averaged master equation eq([me1 ] ) .",
    "in particular we note that the average population difference @xmath82 between the dots is a constant of the motion in the absence of any free hamiltonian .",
    "however the stochastic differential equations enable us to calculate important averages that are _ not _ obtainable from the master equation .",
    "for example , if the model does indeed describe a measurement of @xmath83 , then , in the absence of tunneling , we would expect to see the conditional state become localized at either @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "indeed for @xmath86 we can see from the conditional equation for @xmath87 that @xmath88 is a fixed point .",
    "we can take into account both fixed points by considering @xmath89 . in the absence of tunneling",
    "this must must approach @xmath4 for all trajectories , since the system will eventually become localized due to the measurement in one dot or the other .",
    "therefore it is sensible to take the ensemble average @xmath90 $ ] and find the rate at which this deterministic quantity approaches one . noting that for a stochastic variable we have @xmath91 , and that @xmath92={\\rm e}% [ dn]=[d_{0}+d_{1}(1-z_{{\\rm c}})/2]dt$ ] , we find that @xmath93}{dt}={\\rm e}\\left [ \\frac{d_{1}^{2}(1-z_{{\\rm % c}}^{2})^{2}}{4d_{0}+2d_{1}(1-z_{{\\rm c}})}\\right ] .\\ ] ]    if the system starts state which has an equal probability for single electron to be on each dot then @xmath94 and in the ensemble average this would remain the case .",

    "this is the same as the decoherence rate , @xmath100 , as expected .",
    "but for @xmath101 , the rate goes to @xmath102 .",
    "that is , the rate at which the system becomes localized at one or the other dot is much less than the decoherence rate .",
    "this result can not be obtained from the ensemble averaged master equation alone .",
    "it is a direct reflection of the fact that for @xmath103 a tunneling event can not be unambiguously attributed to the location of an electron on the double dot system .",
    "as the rate of localization is a direct indication of the quality of the measurement , we can use the localization rate defined as @xmath104 as an important parameter defining the quality of the measurement .",
    "this parameter is related to the signal - to - noise ratio for this measurement as we now show .    for a poisson process at rate @xmath105 , the probability for @xmath106 events to occur in time",
    "@xmath107 is @xmath108 the mean and variance of this distribution are equal and given by @xmath109 .",
    "now consider an electron which is , with equal likelihood , in either dot , so that @xmath110 . if the electron is in dot 1 then the rate of electrons passing through the set is @xmath111 ; if it is in dot two then it is just @xmath25 .",
    "these two possibilities will begin to be distinguishable when the difference in the means of the two distributions @xmath112 is of order the square root of the sum of the variances .",
    "that is , when @xmath113 solving this for @xmath107 gives a characteristic rate @xmath114 the right hand side of this expression is simply twice the @xmath115 defined above .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached in reference @xcite .    in the ideal limit of no quiescent current in the set @xmath116",
    ", the stochastic master equation can be replaced by a stochastic schrdinger equation , and will collapse to a single possibility at a rate @xmath117 which is the same as the decoherence rate .",
    "the effect of @xmath25 is most clearly seen in the other limit , @xmath118 , as noted above . in this limit",
    "the single electron makes only a small relative change in the tunneling rate through the set .",
    "as the rate of jumps also becomes large , the trajectories in this limit take on the appearance of diffusion rather than jumps .",
    "the rate at which the electron localizes into one well or the other scales as @xmath119 , which is much longer than the decoherence time scale @xmath120 . [ earlier ]",
    "we now turn to numerical simulations of the conditional evolution and to estimate the conditions for a good measurement . unlike traditional condensed matter measurements we wish to describe repeated measurements made on a single quantum system rather than a single measurement made upon an ensemble of systems .",
    "to do this we use the conditional dynamics of the measured system given a particular measurement record as described by the above stochastic evolution equation ( [ condev2 ] )    we return to the bloch description defined in eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) . in what follows we will assume that @xmath121 . for the form of tunneling used here the value of @xmath122 does not in fact change under either conditional or ensemble averaged dynamics .",
    "if the conditional state of the system remains in a pure state then @xmath123 .",
    "as noted previously this can only occur if the bare tunneling rate ( @xmath6 ) is zero , when a tunneling event can unambiguously be attributed to the occupation of the target dot and no information is lost about the state of the system . in the more realistic case in which @xmath124 , we can use the quantity @xmath125 as a measure of the purity of the sate , or equivalently as a measure of how much information the conditional record of measurements gives about the actual state of the two coupled dots .",
    "if the conditional state is a maximally mixed state of a two state system then @xmath126 .",
    "we now describe in detail the numerical simulation of the conditional dynamics .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath127 , so the system is always in a pure state .",
    "typical trajectories are shown in fig .  4 for various values of @xmath128 . for small @xmath129 we see little evidence for coherent tunneling .",
    "most of the time the electron is localized almost entirely in one well or the other .",
    "however , there is an asymmetry between the wells .",
    "a transition from dot-2 into dot-1 ( the target ) is sudden , occurring whenever an electron tunnels through the set .",
    "a transition the other way takes a time of order @xmath130 .",
    "this time is still much smaller than the average time between state - changing transitions , which can be shown analytically to be @xmath131 .",
    "thus over a long time , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the system still has the appearance of a random telegraph .",
    "this behaviour gives rise to a single - peaked noise spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) .    for moderate @xmath132",
    "the system is no longer well - localized in one dot or the other .",
    "rather , the dynamics is complicated with clearly non - sinusoidal oscillations from one dot to the other interspersed with jumps into the target dot .",
    "the fact that oscillations are present gives peaks in the current noise spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "the position of these peaks is a frequency less than @xmath70 , as shown analytically in sec .",
    "for @xmath133 the dynamics once again becomes simple , with nearly sinusoidal oscillations interspersed with jumps which occur with an average rate of @xmath100 .",
    "this corresponds to a noise spectrum having a very sharp feature at @xmath134 , as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) .    the change in behaviour as @xmath70 increases is summarized in fig .  5 . there",
    "we plot e@xmath135 $ ] versus @xmath136 .",
    "the quantity e@xmath137 $ ] measures how well localized the electron is at one well or the other , and would be @xmath4 if the electron were always localized and @xmath138 if it were never localized .",
    "it is actually possible to calculate this quantity numerically without using a stochastic ensemble , as follows .    with no background current , every time an electron tunnels through the set the electron on the dots is known to be on dot @xmath4 .",
