    "the influence of retardation is large above pion threshold and only its incorporation leads to a satisfactory theoretical description of deuteron photodisintegration in the @xmath4-region .",
    "on the other hand , e.m.off-shell effects turned out to be quite small  @xcite .    due to the possibility of an independent variation of energy and momentum transfer in the space - like region and the existence of a longitudinal polarization of the exchanged virtual photon",
    ", it is expected that electrodisintegration of the deuteron will provide additional insights into the hadronic properties of the @xmath0-system .",
    "for example , it allows the study of the @xmath0-interaction in the short - range regime independent of the excitation energy in contrast to photodisintegration .",
    "moreover , in quasifree kinematics this reaction is an important tool for the exctraction of nucleon properties like , e.g.  the electric form factor of the neutron  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we have extended our approach to electrodisintegration . in the next section , a brief survey of our model",
    "then , in sect",
    ".  [ result ] , results are presented and compared to experimental data for some selected kinematics and , finally , some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the model hilbert space consists of three basic configurations , i.e.two nucleons ( @xmath0 ) , one nucleon and one delta ( @xmath5 ) , and two nucleons and one meson ( e.g.  @xmath6 ) .",
    "the basic hadronic interactions are determined by baryon - baryon - meson vertices , where we include as mesons @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . inserting the vertices into the appropriate lippmann - schwinger equation , one obtains after some straightforward algebra  @xcite the desired retarded one - boson - exchange operators describing the interactions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in our explicit realization ,",
    "we use for the parametrization of the retarded @xmath0-interaction the elster potential  @xcite , which includes in addition one - pion loop diagrams as nucleon self energy contributions in order to fulfil unitarity above pion threshold . for this reason",
    ", one has to distinguish between bare and physical nucleons .",
    "for details we refer to  @xcite . for the interactions @xmath10 and @xmath12 , we take besides retarded pion exchange in addition only static @xmath13-exchange into account .",
    "moreover , the interaction of two nucleons in the channel with deuteron quantum numbers in the presence of a spectator pion , called @xmath2-channel , is also considered . by a suitable box renormalization",
    "@xcite , an approximate phase equivalence between the elster potential , which does not include @xmath4-d.o.f . , and our coupled channel approach below pion threshold is obtained .",
    "the hadronic @xmath4-parameters are fitted to the @xmath14-channel of pion - nucleon scattering and the @xmath15-channel in @xmath0-scattering . for the sake of comparison with the conventional approach with static interactions ,",
    "we have constructed also a static version of our model interaction based on the bonn obepr - potential  @xcite where in accordance with the usual treatment the pion - nucleon loop diagrams have been neglected . for the results presented below , we have used two of the various model versions discussed in  @xcite , namely ",

    "interaction of the model is described in detail in  @xcite and consists of baryon and meson one - body currents as well as kroll - rudermann ( contact ) and vertex contributions .",
    "these currents are , together with the @xmath16-vertex , the basic building blocks of the corresponding effective current operators for two baryons consisting of one- and two - body contributions .",
    "the matrix element of the effective nucleon one - body operator between plane - wave states of two bare nucleons @xmath17 is given in  @xcite for real photons .",

    "moreover , the propagators of the loop diagrams with an intermediate @xmath29-state have to be modified due to the fact that @xmath30 in electrodisintegration .    for the one - body ( @xmath31)-transition current",
    ", we take the usual nonrelativistic form including only the dominant @xmath32-transition @xmath33 where @xmath34 as has been outlined in detail in  @xcite , the e.m.coupling constant @xmath35 has been fixed for real photons by a fit of the @xmath36-multipole of pion photoproduction on the nucleon . due to nonresonant rescattering mechanisms",
    ", it becomes complex and dependent on the invariant mass @xmath37 of the @xmath38-subsystem for which we adopt the spectator - on - shell approach  @xcite .",
    "moreover , when embedded into a nuclear medium , @xmath39 depends also on the photon momentum @xmath40 and the photon energy @xmath41 .",
    "as has been shown in  @xcite , at least for photodisintegration a so - called on - shell prescription @xmath42 turns out to be very accurate , simplifying considerably the numerical evaluation .",
    "the resulting coupling constant used in this paper is parametrized as follows @xmath43 with @xmath44 where the on - shell pion momentum @xmath45 is a function of @xmath37 according to @xmath46 , while for @xmath47 we have set @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters in ( [ para_delta2 ] ) have been fitted to the resulting coupling constant ",
    "@xmath49 \" discussed in  @xcite and are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in addition a contribution from the @xmath50-transtion charge density is included . for virtual photons , again @xmath51",
    "must be multiplied with an appropriate e.m .",
    "transition form factor which for simplicity has been chosen in the dipole form .",
    "we are aware of the fact that with increasing momentum transfer one finds a slightly stronger fall - off of @xmath52 with @xmath53 compared to the dipole form  @xcite .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves here to kinematics with @xmath54 @xmath55 where the difference does not matter .    with respect to the two - body currents , we consider , as in  @xcite , meson retardation in the pure pion exchange contributions whereas retardation in @xmath56-mec turned out to be unimportant in photodisintegration  @xcite , but very cpu - time consuming . therefore , in order to facilitate our numerical evaluation , we have neglected retardation in the latter contribution .",
    "furthermore , we include in addition static @xmath13-exchange as well as various @xmath4-mec which have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "similar to the e.m .",
    "loop corrections the transition from photo- to electrodisintegration leads to some modifications in the intermediate @xmath57-propagators as well as for the incorporation of an e.m .  form factor .    in the static model the e.m .",
    "loop contributions @xmath58 to the nucleonic one - body current are neglected naturally and the hadronic dressing factor @xmath59 is replaced by 1 .",
    "obviously , the mec contain only the usual static terms .",
    "note that in the static limit the recoil contributions do not contribute due to their cancellation against the wave function renormalization  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the static limit there are no nonrelativistic mec - contributions to the charge operator .    for the numerical evaluation of the @xmath60-matrix for deuteron electrodisintegration , we use the standard multipole decomposition of the e.m .",
    "moreover , we take advantage of siegert s theorem which allows to express the dominant contributions of the transverse electric multipoles via the charge multipoles .",
    "neglecting polarization effects the differential cross section for deuteron electrodisintegration in the one - photon exchange approximation is determined by four structure functions , two diagonal ones @xmath61 and @xmath62 and two interference ones @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "they are functions of the squared three momentum transfer @xmath65 in the c.m .",
    "system , the final state c.m .- energy @xmath66 , and the angle @xmath67 between @xmath68 and the relative neutron - proton momentum in the final neutron - proton c.m .- system .",
    "we begin the discussion with the experiment of jordan et al .",
    "@xcite for the kinematics @xmath69 mev , @xmath70  @xmath55 which has been performed in order to extract the structure functions @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath63 .",
    "our predictions for these structure functions using both static and retarded operators are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] together with the few existing experimental data points .",
    "since this kinematics is well below pion threshold it is not surprising that both approaches yield almost identical results  in fact only for the smallest structure function @xmath64 the corresponding curves can be distinguished  demonstrating that both approaches are indeed equivalent in this kinematic region .",
    "a similar result has also been found in photodisintegration  @xcite .",
    "the agreement with experiment is quite satisfactory but more data are certainly needed for a more critical comparison .",
    "the situation changes completely if the excitation energy is above pion threshold . as a first example",
    ", we consider in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] the kinematics @xmath73 mev , @xmath74  @xmath55 of an experiment by turck - chieze et al .  @xcite .",
    "whereas @xmath62 is only moderately affected by retardation , the other structure functions , in particular @xmath61 and @xmath63 are much more sensitive to the inclusion of retardation . at forward angles @xmath61 is enhanced by roughly 45 percent while above @xmath75 it is significantly lowered .",
    "especially @xmath63 increases strongly in absolute magnitude .",
    "a detailed analysis has shown that this strong retardation effect is mainly due to the charge recoil contribution to the coulomb monopole ( see fig .  [ figure4a ] for a graphical representation ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] by the dash - dotted curves for which this contribution is switched off .",
    "the remaining retardation effect is significantly smaller . a comparison with the experimental diffferential coincidence cross section is shown in fig .  [ figure5 ] .",
    "one readily notes a considerable enhancement of the cross section in the retarded approach improving significantly the agreement with the data .",
    "but the agreement is not perfect , the theory being a little too low in the maximum around @xmath76 and somewhat too large at higher angles .",
    "again , the most important contribution of retardation is due to the recoil charge contribution to the monopole .",
    "the importance of retardation becomes even more striking for excitation energies @xmath77 in the @xmath4-region .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] for the kinematics of a more recent experiment by pellegrino et al .",
    "@xcite with @xmath78 mev and @xmath79  @xmath55 .",
    "the effects of retardation on @xmath71 anf @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] are even stronger than in the previous example . however , in the differential cross section the retardation effects in the different structure functions appear to cancel each other to a large extent so that static and retarded approaches yield very close results in the measured angular range @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) but lead to a slight underestimation of the experiment .",
    "the better agreement between theory and experiment reported in  @xcite is obtained by the use of a modified @xmath82-coupling which is considerably stronger than ours given in table  [ tab1 ] due to the assumption of a vanishing nonresonant contribution to the @xmath36-multipole . however , as has been discussed in  @xcite , this approach causes formal inconsistencies and is , therefore , questionable .    comparing the static as well the retarded results for @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] to experimental data , one notes a sizable underestimation of both approaches .",
    "this discrepancy may have different origins .",
    "first of all , one has to be aware of the fact that the majority of the data ( full circles in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) has been extracted under the assumption @xmath83 which is well justified only in the static , but not all in the retarded approach .",
    "only the open square data points have been obtained without this assumption .",
    "concerning the theoretical uncertainties , the present approach does not contain all relativistic contributions of leading order in @xmath84 as is the case in the approach , for example , of ritz et al .",
    "on the other hand , among the relativistic contributions retardation effects are unique with respect to the singularity structure of the corresponding meson - nucleon propagators above pion threshold which can not be treated within a taylor expansion in @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , concerning the role of retardation , the approach of  @xcite can not be considered realistic above pion threshold . however , the model of ritz et al.is useful to estimate the role of boost effects ( which do not contain any singularities ) which are still missing in the present approach .",
    "it turns out that for the kinematics of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] they are small . moreover , we have checked that additional , not yet included mechanisms like static @xmath85- or @xmath86-mec , a nonvanishing @xmath87 or a possible @xmath88-excitation of the @xmath4 are small and can not explain the noted discrepancy between theory and experiment in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the role of retardation effects in electrodisintegration of the deuteron for various kinematics .",
    "it turns out that especially the recoil charge contribution to the monopole , which is not present in static approaches , is very important for excitation energies above pion threshold , leading to dramatic changes in the structure functions @xmath61 and @xmath63 whereas the other structure functions @xmath62 and @xmath64 are much less affected .    with respect to future developments ,",
    "one important step concerns an improved treatment of the final - state - interaction .",
    "as has already been noted in  @xcite , the description of the phase shifts in several nn - partial waves is only fairly well above pion threshold for our nn - interaction model .",
    "this touches a general problem of realistic nn - interactions : in contrast to the energy regime below pion threshold , at present no",
    " high precision \" nn - interaction is available for energies above pion threshold .",
    "however , this is an indispensable ingredient for any theoretical description of e.m.reactions on the deuteron above pion threshold like photo- or electrodisintegration , but also meson production on the deuteron",
    ". a further interesting topic will be the study of polarization observables which supposedly are more sensitive to interaction effects .",
