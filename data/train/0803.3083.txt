    "to successfully find the true counterparts to the xrbs in the gc we need to obtain spectra of @xmath01000 - 1500 ir stars - a nearly infeasible task to perform via traditional longslit single - object spectroscopy .",

    "flamingos-2 has a fully cryogenic optical train , illustrated in fig.1 , with 9 spherical refractive elements and two front - surface gold flat mirrors .",
    "the window and 7 of the lenses are single - crystalline caf@xmath5 ; the other two lenses are made from ohara sftm-16 .",
    "progressing from the top to the bottom of the figure , light first passes through the window to a focus .",
    "the mos wheel lies at the telescope focus and contains an imaging aperture and , most importantly , a selection of custom aperture masks ( `` mosplates '' ) ; it also caries 6 long slits .",
    "it is immediately followed by a selectable baffle , called the decker wheel , and the field lens .",
    "the optical path then is folded by the flat mirrors to the other two elements of the collimator optics . at this point",
    "the beam is collimated .",
    "two wheels carrying a selection of filters for imaging and spectroscopy are spaced on either side of the lyot wheel .",
    "flamingos-2 was designed for operation with the telescope s",
    "_ f/16 _ beam but it also can accept the @xmath0__f/30 _ _ beam from the gemini multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) system , and the lyot wheel carries pupil stops for both modes of operation .",
    "the final mechanism is a wheel carrying a selection of grisms ; it also includes a clear aperture for the imaging mode of operation .",
    "light is then re - imaged onto the hawaii - ii array by a 6-element camera lens assembly .",
    "standard near - ir @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 filters are installed in one of the filter wheels ; gemini may additionally offer a @xmath9-band filter ( 0.97 - 1.07 ) .",
    "two specialty spectroscopy filters are installed in the other filter wheel , one covering the @xmath10 bandpasses , the other covering @xmath3 .",
    "three grisms reside in the grism wheel , two with moderate resolving power , @xmath11 , and one grism with high resolving power , @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 grisms are used in conjunction with the @xmath10 or @xmath3 bandpass filters , while the @xmath12 grism is used with the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 standard near - ir filters for out - of - bandpass blocking .",
    "several features of flamingos-2 make it ideal for surveying the galactic center : _ ( a ) _ a wide imaging fov of @xmath06.2 arcminutes@xmath2 ( @xmath03.1 arcminutes@xmath2 with mcao ) , _ ( b ) _ the ability to carry up to 9 custom mosplates at a time , _ ( c ) _ the mosplates large spectroscopic fov of 2@xmath16.2 square arcminutes ( 1@xmath13.1 square arcminutes with mcao ) , _ ( d ) _ the cooling of the masks to cryogenic temperatures which allow low internal instrument background for operation in the k - band , and _ ( e ) _ the ability to quickly exchange the set of mosplates .    the mos wheel , shown in fig .",
    "2a , is 0.9 meters in diameter .",
    "it has three circular apertures positioned around the periphery of the wheel ; one is left open for imaging and the other two usually contain pinhole masks for engineering .",
    "equally spaced between the circular apertures are 9 rectangular slots for holding custom mosplates . a test mosplate is shown in fig .",
    "2b . the mosplate fov ( _ f/16-mode _ ) has sufficient sky - coverage to design custom mosplates containing up to @xmath090 slitlets .",
    "mosplates can be changed during the daytime without thermally cycling the entire instrument .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 is a _ gate valve _ , positioned between the field lens and the folding flat mirrors . at the end of a night of observing this valve is closed , the mos dewar cooling is halted , and a warm - up heater is turned on .",
    "several hours later , during the daytime , an engineer can open the access port on the side of the mos dewar .",
    "each mosplate is held in a frame which slides into the edge of the mos wheel .",
    "the observed plates are removed , and a new set of mosplates , each one already mounted in a frame , are slid into place .",
    "the engineer then closes up the access port and begins the process of evacuating and cooling the dewar . once it is cold enough",
    "the gate valve is then re - opened . by design ,",
    "this should be completed in time for the observers who return that evening .",
    "if each plate is observed for only 1 hour , @xmath0800 spectra could be obtained with a single night s observation using all 9 mosplates . with only three nights of observing potentially up to @xmath02400 spectra",
    "could be obtained .",
    "s mos mode of operation is ideally suited for identifying the true stellar counterparts to the x - ray sources in the gc ."
