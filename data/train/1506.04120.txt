    "the 2013 nobel prize in physics was awarded to francois englert and peter higgs for their work in 1964 that led in 2012 to the discovery at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) of the higgs boson after its being sought for almost 50 years .",
    "it is great tragedy that robert brout , the joint author with francois englert of one of the papers that led to the 2013 nobel prize , died in 2011 , just one year before the discovery of the higgs boson and two years before the awarding of the nobel prize for it .",
    "( for me personally this is keenly felt since my first post - doc was with robert and francois in brussels 1970 - 1972 . )",
    "the paper coauthored by englert and brout appeared on august 31 , 1964 in physical review letters @xcite after being submitted on june 26 , 1964 and was two and one half pages long .",
    "higgs wrote two papers on the topic .",
    "his first paper appeared on september 15 , 1964 in physics letters @xcite after being submitted on july 27 , 1964 and was one and one half pages long , and the second paper appeared on october 19 , 1964 in physical review letters @xcite after being submitted on august 31 , 1964 and was also one and one half pages long .",
    "thus a grand total of just five and one half pages .",
    "the significance of the higgs mechanism introduced in these papers and the higgs boson identified by higgs is that they are tied in with the theory of the origin of mass , and of the way that mass can arise through collective effects ( known as broken symmetry ) that only occur in systems with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "such collective effects are properties that a system of many objects collectively possess that each one individually does not  the whole being greater than the sum of its parts .",
    "a typical example is temperature .",
    "a single molecule of @xmath0 does not have a temperature , and one can not tell if it was taken from ice , water or steam .",
    "these different phases are collective properties of large numbers of @xmath0 molecules acting in unison . moreover , as one changes the temperature all the @xmath0 molecules can act collectively to change the phase ( freezing water into ice for instance ) , with it being the existence of such phase changes that is central to broken symmetry .",
    "i counted at least 19 times that nobel prizes in physics have in one way or another been given for aspects of the problem : dirac ( 1933 ) ; anderson ( 1936 ) ; lamb ( 1955 ) ; landau ( 1962 ) ; tomonaga , schwinger , feynman ( 1965 ) ; gell - mann ( 1969 ) ; bardeen , cooper , schrieffer ( 1972 ) ; richter , ting ( 1976 ) ; glashow , salam , weinberg ( 1979 ) ; wilson ( 1982 ) ; rubbia , van der meer ( 1984 ) ; friedman , kendall , taylor ( 1990 ) ; lee , osheroff , richardson ( 1996 ) ; t hooft , veltman ( 1999 ) ; abrikosov , ginzburg , leggett ( 2003 ) ; gross , politzer , wilczek ( 2004 ) ; nambu , kobayashi , maskawa ( 2008 ) ; englert , higgs ( 2013 ) ; kajita , mcdonald ( 2015 ) . and",
    "this leaves out anderson who made major contributions to collective aspects of mass generation and yang who ( with mills ) developed non - abelian yang - mills gauge theories but got nobel prizes ( anderson 1977 , yang 1957 ) for something else .    in this paper",
    "i provide a pedagogical review the work of the work that led up to the discovery of the higgs boson and discuss its implications @xcite .",
    "as introduced by newton mass was mechanical .",
    "the first ideas on dynamical mass were due to poincare ( poincare stresses needed to stabilize an electron all of whose mass came from its own electromagnetic self - energy according to @xmath1 ) .",
    "however this was all classical .    with quantum field theory ,",
    "the mass of a particle is able to change through self interactions ( radiative corrections to the self - energy ",
    "lamb shift ) to give @xmath2 , or through a change in vacuum ( bardeen , cooper , schrieffer  bcs theory ) according to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the self - consistent gap parameter .",
    "then through nambu ( 1960 ) and goldstone ( 1961 ) the possibility arose that not just some but in fact all of the mass could come from self interaction , and especially so for gauge bosons , viz .",
    "anderson ( 1958 , 1963 ) , englert and brout ( 1964 ) , higgs ( 1964 ) , guralnik , hagen , and kibble ( 1964 ) .",
    "this culminated in the weinberg ( 1967 ) , salam ( 1968 ) , and glashow ( 1961 , 1970 ) renormalizable @xmath5 local gauge theory of electroweak interactions , and the confirming discoveries first of weak neutral currents ( 1973 ) , then charmed particles ( 1974 ) , then the intermediate vector bosons of the weak interactions ( 1983 ) , and finally the higgs boson ( 2012 ) .",
    "all of this is possible because of dirac s hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics in which one sets @xmath6 , with the physics being in the properties of the states @xmath7 .",
    "we thus live in hilbert space and not in coordinate space , and not only that , there is altogether more in hilbert space than one could imagine , such as half - integer spin and collective macroscopic quantum systems such as superconductors and superfluids .",
    "in this hilbert space we find an infinite dirac sea of negative energy particles .",
    "this large number of degrees of freedom can act collectively to provide the dynamics needed to produce mass generation and the higgs boson .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson was announced by cern on july 4 , 2012 , accompanied by simultaneous announcements by the experimental groups atlas and cms at the large hadron collider at cern , as then followed by parallel publications that were simultaneously submitted to physics letters b on july 31 , 2012 and published on september 17 , 2012 , one publication by the atlas collaboration @xcite , and the other by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "the atlas paper had 2924 authors , and the cms paper had 2883 .",
    "the higgs boson signature used by both collaborations was to look for the decay into lepton pairs of any higgs boson that might be produced in high energy proton proton collisions at the large hadron collider",
    ".    from amongst a set of @xmath8 proton - proton collisions produced at the large hadron collider , of the order of 240,000 collisions produce a higgs boson . of them just 350 decay into pairs of gamma rays and just 8 decay into a pair of leptons .",
    "the search for the higgs boson is thus a search for some very rare events .",
    "thus to see higgs bosons one needs an energy high enough to produce them and the sensitivity to see such rare decays when they are produced . in searches over the years",
    "it was not known in what energy regime to look for higgs particles , with the large hadron collider proving to be the collider whose energy was high enough that one could finally explore in detail the 125 gev energy domain where the higgs boson was ultimately found to exist .",
    "in order to characterize macroscopic ordered phases in a general way landau introduced the concept of a macroscopic order parameter @xmath9 . for",
    "a ferromagnet for instance @xmath9 would represent the spontaneous magnetization @xmath10 and would thus be a matrix element of a field operator in an ordered quantum state that described the ordered magnetic phase .",
    "building on this approach ginzburg and landau @xcite wrote down a lagrangian for such a @xmath9 for a superconductor , with kinetic energy @xmath11 and potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the critical temperature . for temperatures above the critical temperature",
    "the potential would have the shape of a single well , viz .",
    "like the letter u , with the coefficient of the @xmath14 term being positive . for temperatures below the critical temperature the potential would have the shape of a double well , viz",
    ". like the letter w , with the coefficient of the @xmath14 term being negative . above the critical temperature the order parameter would be zero at the minimum of the potential ( normal phase with state vector @xmath15 in which @xmath16 ) .",
    "below the critical temperature the order parameter would be nonzero ( superconducting state @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is nonzero ) .    in 1957",
    "bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer @xcite developed a macroscopic theory of superconductivity ( bcs ) based on cooper pairing of electrons in the presence of a filled fermi sea of electrons , and explicitly constructed the state @xmath17 .",
    "in this state the matrix element @xmath19 was equal to a spacetime independent function @xmath4 , the gap parameter , which led to a mass shift to electrons propagating in the superconductor of the form @xmath3 .",
    "the gap parameter @xmath4 would be temperature dependent ( @xmath20 ) , and would only be nonzero below the critical temperature . in 1959",
    "gorkov @xcite was able to derive the ginzburg - landau lagrangian starting from the bcs theory and identify the order parameter as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a coherent state in the hilbert space based on @xmath17 . in the superconducting case",
    "then @xmath9 is not itself a quantum - field - theoretic operator ( viz .",
    "a q - number operator that would have a canonical conjugate with which it would not commute ) but is instead a c - number matrix element of a q - number field operator in a macroscopic coherent quantum state .    in 1958",
    "anderson @xcite used the bcs theory to explain the meissner effect , an effect in which electromagnetism becomes short range inside a superconductor , with photons propagating in it becoming massive .",
    "the effect was one of spontaneous breakdown of local gauge invariance , and was explored in detail by anderson @xcite and nambu @xcite .    in parallel with these studies",
    "nambu @xcite , goldstone @xcite , and nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite explored the spontaneous breakdown of some continuous global symmetries and showed that collective massless excitations ( goldstone bosons ) were generated , and that the analog gap parameter would provide for dynamically induced fermion masses . in 1962 goldstone , salam , and weinberg @xcite showed that there would always be massless goldstone bosons in any lorentz invariant theory in which a continuous global symmetry was spontaneously broken .",
    "while one could avoid this outcome if the symmetry was also broken in the lagrangian , as was thought to be the case for the pion , a non - massless but near goldstone particle ( i.e. one with broken symmetry suppressed couplings to matter at low energies ) , in general the possible presence of massless goldstone bosons was a quite problematic outcome because it would imply the existence of non - observed long range forces .    in 1962",
    "schwinger @xcite raised the question of whether gauge invariance actually required that photons be massless , and noted for the inverse photon propagator @xmath23 that if the vacuum polarization @xmath24 had a massless pole of the form @xmath25 , then @xmath26 would behave as the massive particle @xmath27 .",
    "a massless goldstone boson could thus produce a massive vector boson .",
    "with anderson having shown that a photon would become become massive in a superconductor , there was a spirited discussion in the literature ( anderson @xcite , klein and lee @xcite , gilbert @xcite ) as to whether an effect such as this might hold in a relativistic theory as well or whether it might just have been an artifact of the fact that the bcs theory was non - relativistic . with the work of englert and brout @xcite and higgs @xcite , and then guralnik , hagen , and kibble @xcite , the issue was finally resolved , with it being established that in the relativistic case the goldstone theorem did not in fact",
    "hold if there was a spontaneous breakdown of a continuous local theory , with the would - be goldstone boson no longer being an observable massless particle but instead combining with the initially massless vector boson to produce a massive vector boson .",
    "technically , this mechanism should be known as the anderson , englert , brout , higgs , guralnik , hagen , kibble mechanism , and while it has undergone many name variations over time , it is now commonly called the higgs mechanism .",
    "what set higgs work apart from the others was that in his 1964 physical review letters paper higgs noted that as well as a massive gauge boson there should also be an observable massive scalar boson , this being the higgs boson .    at the time of its development in 1964",
    "there was not much interest in the higgs mechanism , with all of the englert and brout , higgs , and guralnik , hagen and kibble papers getting hardly any citations during the 1960s at all .",
    "the primary reason for this was that at the time there was little interest in non - abelian yang - mills gauge theories in general , broken or unbroken , and not only was there no experimental indication at all that one should consider them , it was not clear if yang - mills theories were even quantum - mechanically viable .",
    "all this changed in the early 1970s when t hooft and veltman showed that these theories were renormalizable , and large amounts of data started to point in the direction of the relevance of non - abelian gauge theories to physics , leading to the @xmath28 picture of strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions , which culminated in the discoveries of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 intermediate vector bosons ( 1983 ) with masses that were generated by the higgs mechanism , and then finally the higgs boson itself ( 2012 ) .",
    "what gave the higgs boson the prominence that it ultimately came to have was the realization that in the electroweak @xmath5 theory the higgs boson not only gives masses to the gauge bosons while maintaining renormalizability , but through its yukawa couplings to the quarks and leptons of the theory it gives masses to the fermions as well .",
    "the higgs boson is thus responsible not just for the masses of the gauge bosons then but for the masses of all the other fundamental particles as well , causing it to be dubbed the  god particle \" @xcite .",
    "plotted as a function of @xmath9,width=480,height=288 ]    even though broken symmetry is an intrinsically quantum - mechanical phenomenon , one can illustrate many of the aspects needed to understand the higgs boson by considering properties not of a q - number quantum field such as a quantum scalar field @xmath32 but of its c - number vacuum matrix element @xmath33 .",
    "below we shall explore the quantum mechanics of broken symmetry , but for pedagogical purposes it is convenient to first proceed as though one could treat the problem classically by studying properties of the c - number @xmath34 without needing to delve into its origin or significance .    thus consider a real classical scalar field ( just one degree of freedom ) with a potential energy in the form of the double - well potential shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , viz . a potential",
    "shaped like a letter w with two wells : @xmath35 this potential has a discrete symmetry under @xmath36 , with its first two derivatives being given by @xmath37 the potential has a local maximum at @xmath38 where @xmath39 is zero and @xmath40 is negative , and two - fold * degenerate * global minima at @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45 is positive . since @xmath38 is a local maximum , if we consider small oscillations around @xmath38 of the form @xmath46 we generate a negative quadratic term @xmath47 and thus negative mass squared , viz .",
    "@xmath48 , a so - called tachyon .",
    "the tachyon signals an instability of the configuration with @xmath38 ( i.e. we roll away from the top of the hill )",
    ".    however if we fluctuate around either global minimum ( i.e. we oscillate in the vertical around the bottom of either hill ) by setting @xmath49 we get @xmath50 the field @xmath51 now has the positive @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus ( goldstone 1961 ) the would - be tachyonic particle becomes a massive particle , and with one scalar field we obtain one particle .",
    "this particle is the * higgs boson * in embryo .",
    "the @xmath44 potential term contributes to the * cosmological constant * , and would be unacceptably large ( @xmath54 times too large ) if the boson has the 125 gev mass that the higgs boson has now been found to have .",
    "all this arises because the minimum is two - fold degenerate , and picking either one breaks the symmetry spontaneously , since while one could just as equally be in either one or the other , one could not be in both .",
    "this is just like people at a dinner .",
    "each one can take the cup to their left or their right , but once one person has done so , the rest have no choice .",
    "however a person at the opposite end of the table may not know what choice was made at the other end of the table and may make the opposite choice of cup , and thus persons in the middle could finish up with no cup . to ensure that this does not happen",
    "we need long range correlations  hence massless goldstone bosons .",
    "consider a complex scalar field ( two degrees of freedom ) @xmath55 , @xmath56 , with a potential energy in the shape of a rotated letter w or a broad - brimmed , high - crowned mexican hat :    @xmath57    the potential has a continuous global symmetry of the form @xmath58 with constant @xmath59 , with derivatives @xmath60 this potential has a local maximum at @xmath61 where @xmath39 is zero , and infinitely * degenerate * global minima at @xmath62 ( the entire 360 degree valley or trough between the brim and the crown of the mexican hat ) .",
    "again we would have a tachyon if we expand around the local maximum , only this time we would get two . so fluctuate around any one of the global minima by setting @xmath63 , @xmath64 , to get @xmath65 the ( embryonic ) higgs boson field is now @xmath66 with @xmath52 .",
    "however , the field @xmath67 no has * no mass at all * ( it corresponds to horizontal oscillations along the valley floor ) , and is known as a * goldstone boson * ( goldstone 1961 ) .",
    "thus from a complex scalar field we obtain two particles .",
    "since the goldstone boson is massless , it travels at the speed of light .",
    "it is thus intrinsically relativistic , and being massless can provide for long range correlations .",
    "moreover , if such particles exist then they could generate fermion masses entirely dynamically ( nambu 1960 , nambu and jona - lasinio 1961 ) , with the pion actually serving this purpose .",
    "the @xmath44 potential term remains and the cosmological constant problem is just as severe as before .",
    "now if we have massless particles , we would get long range forces ( just like photons ) , and yet nuclear and weak forces are short range .",
    "so what can we do about such goldstone bosons .",
    "two possibilities - they could get some mass because the symmetry is not exact ( pion mass ) , or we could get rid of them altogether ( the higgs mechanism ) .",
    "consider the model studied by higgs ( 1964 ) consisting of a complex scalar field ( two degrees of freedom ) coupled to a massless vector gauge boson ( another two degrees of freedom ) for a total of four degrees of freedom in all , viz .",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the system has kinetic energy @xmath71 and potential energy @xmath72 : @xmath73 and because of the gauge boson the system is now invariant under continuous * local * gauge transformations of the form @xmath74 , @xmath75 with spacetime dependent @xmath76 .",
    "with derivatives @xmath77 the potential has a local maximum at @xmath78 where @xmath79 is zero and * degenerate * global minima at @xmath80 ( infinitely degenerate since independent of @xmath81 ) .",
    "again we would have two tachyons if we expand around the local maximum .",
    "so fluctuate around the global minimum by setting @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "on defining @xmath84 we obtain @xmath85 there is again a higgs boson field @xmath66 with @xmath52 .",
    "however , the field @xmath67 has disappeared completely .",
    "instead the vector boson now has a * nonzero mass * given by @xmath86 . since a massive gauge boson has three degrees of freedom ( two transverse and one longitudinal ) while a massless gauge boson such as the photon only has two transverse degrees of freedom , the would - be massless goldstone boson is absorbed into the now massive gauge boson to provide its needed longitudinal degree of freedom . hence a massless goldstone boson and a massless gauge boson",
    "are replaced by one massive gauge boson , with two long - range interactions being replaced by one short range interaction .",
    "this is known as the higgs mechanism ( 1964 ) though it was initially found by anderson ( 1958 ) in his study of the meissner effect in superconductivity .",
    "the remaining fourth of the original four degrees of freedom becomes the massive higgs boson , and its presence is an indicator that the higgs mechanism has taken place .",
    "however , the cosmological constant problem remains as severe as before .",
    "to discuss broken symmetry in quantum field theory it is convenient to introduce local sources . in the gell - mann - low adiabatic switching procedure one introduces a quantum - mechanical lagrangian density @xmath87 of interest , switches on a local source @xmath88 for some field @xmath32 at time @xmath89 and switches it off at @xmath90 .",
    "while the source is active the lagrangian of the theory is given by @xmath91 . before the source",
    "is switched on the system is in the ground state @xmath92 of the hamiltonian density @xmath93 associate with @xmath87 , and after the source is switched off the system is in the state @xmath94 . while @xmath92 and @xmath92 are both eigenstates of @xmath93 , they differ by a phase , a phase that is fixed by @xmath88 according to @xmath95|\\omega_j\\rangle = e^{iw(j ) } , \\label{m10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this expression serving to define the functional @xmath96 .",

    "functional variation of @xmath109 then yields @xmath110 to relate @xmath111 back to the source @xmath102 .    on expanding around the point where all external momenta vanish ,",
    "we can write @xmath109 as @xmath112 . \\label{m17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath113 is known as the effective potential ( which is spacetime independent if @xmath114 is ) , while the @xmath115 term serves as the kinetic energy of @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath116 green s functions can contain two kinds of contributions , tree approximation graphs that involve vertex interactions but no loops , and radiative correction graphs that do contain loops . for constant @xmath114 and @xmath102 the effective potential",
    "is related to the source via @xmath117 , so that @xmath102 does indeed break any symmetry that @xmath118 might possess .",
    "the significance of @xmath118 is that when @xmath102 is zero , we can write @xmath118 as @xmath119 where @xmath17 and @xmath15 are spontaneously broken and normal vacua in which @xmath120 is nonzero and @xmath121 is zero . in the analyses of classical potentials such as @xmath122 and classical kinetic energies",
    "such as @xmath123 presented above , the classical field @xmath9 represented @xmath114 , the potential @xmath124 represented @xmath118 , the kinetic energy represented @xmath125 , and in the @xmath116 green s functions only tree approximation graphs were included .",
    "in this way the search for non - trivial minima of @xmath124 is actually a search for states @xmath17 in which @xmath126 would be negative .",
    "thus while the analyses presented above in sec .",
    "iv looked to be classical they actually had a quantum - mechanical underpinning with the classical field being a c - number vacuum matrix element of a q - number quantum field .",
    "it is in this way that the classical analyses presented above are to be understood .    to understand the nature of a broken symmetry vacuum it is instructive to reconsider @xmath101 .",
    "it is associated with a system @xmath93 to which an external field has been added .",
    "this external field breaks the symmetry by hand at the level of the lagrangian since an effective potential such as @xmath127 would be lopsided with one of its minima lower than the other , and would not have any @xmath128 symmetry .",
    "such a situation is analogous to that found in a ferromagnet . in the presence of an external magnetic field ( cf .",
    "@xmath102 ) all the spins line up in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "if one is above the critical temperature , then if one removes the magnetic field the spins flop back into a configuration in which the net magnetization is zero .",
    "however , if one is below the critical point , the spins stay aligned and remember the direction of the magnetic field after it has been removed ( hysteresis ) .",
    "moreover , if the magnetic field is taken to point in some other direction , below the critical point the spins will remember that direction instead , and will remain aligned in that particular direction after the magnetic field is removed . for a spherically symmetric ferromagnetic system below the critical point one can thus align the magnetization at any angle @xmath81 over a full @xmath129 to @xmath130 range , and have it remain aligned after the magnetic field is removed .",
    "given all the different orientations of the magnetization that are possible below the critical point , we need to determine in what way we can distinguish them . so consider a single spin pointing in the @xmath131-direction with spin up , and a second spin pointing at an angle @xmath81 corresponding to a rotation through an angle @xmath81 around the @xmath132 axis .",
    "for these two states the overlap is given by @xmath133 with the overlap being nonzero and with the two states thus necessarily being in the same hilbert space .",
    "suppose we now take an @xmath134-dimensional ensemble of these same sets of spin states and evaluate the overlap of the state with all spins pointing in the z - direction and the state with all spins pointing at an angle @xmath81 .",
    "this gives the overlap @xmath135 in the limit in which @xmath134 goes to infinity this overlap goes to zero . with this also being true of excitations built out of these states ,",
    "the two states are now in different hilbert spaces .",
    "thus broken symmetry corresponds to the existence of different , inequivalent vacua , and even though the various vacua all have the same energy ( i.e. degenerate vacua ) , the vacua are all in different hilbert spaces",
    ". the quantum hilbert spaces associated with the various minima of the effective potential ( i.e. the differing states @xmath136 in which the vacuum expectation values @xmath137 are evaluated ) become distinct in the limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom , even though they would not be distinct should @xmath134 be finite .",
    "broken symmetry is thus not only intrinsically quantum - mechanical , it is intrinsically a many - body effect associated with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .    whether or not a hamiltonian @xmath93 possesses such a set of degenerate vacua is a property of @xmath93 itself .",
    "it is not a property of the external field @xmath102 .",
    "the role of the external field is solely to pick one of the vacua , so that the system will then remain in that particular vacuum after the external field is removed . whether or not the system is actually able to remember the direction of the external field after it has been removed is a property of the system itself and not of the external field .    to underscore the need for an infinite number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "consider a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom such as the one - dimensional , one - body , quantum - mechanical system with potential @xmath138 and hamiltonian @xmath139 .",
    "like the field - theoretic @xmath122 , the potential @xmath140 has a double - well structure , with minima at @xmath141 .",
    "however the eigenstates of the hamiltonian can not be localized around either of these two minima .",
    "rather , since the hamiltonian is symmetric under @xmath142 , its eigenstates can only be even functions or odd functions of @xmath143 , and must thus must take support in both of the two wells .",
    "wave functions localized to either of the two wells are in the same hilbert space , as are then linear superpositions of them , with it being the linear combinations that are the eigenstates . thus with a finite number of degrees of freedom , wave functions localized around the two minima are in the same hilbert space .",
    "it is only with an infinite number of degrees of freedom that one could get inequivalent hilbert spaces .    now if the role of @xmath102 is only to pick a vacuum and not to make the chosen state actually be a vacuum , we need to inquire what is there about the @xmath102 dependence of the theory that might tell us whether or not we do finish up in a degenerate vacuum when we let @xmath102 go to zero .",
    "the answer to this question is contained in @xmath101 , with @xmath101 needing to be a multiple - valued function of @xmath102 , with @xmath144 vanishing on one branch of @xmath101 in the limit in which @xmath102 goes to zero , while not vanishing on some other one . as a complex function of @xmath102 the function",

    "the two dynamical bound states are not degenerate in mass ( spontaneously broken chiral symmetry ) , and the dynamical higgs scalar mass @xmath251 is twice the induced mass of the fermion .",
    "the most crucial question for the higgs boson is determining its underlying nature .",
    "thus we need to find some experimental way to determine whether the higgs boson is elementary or dynamical .",
    "if the higgs field is elementary , one would have to treat the higgs lagrangian as a bona fide quantum field theory with an a priori double - well potential being present in the fundamental lagrangian itself .",
    "the great appeal of a higgs potential of the specific form @xmath122 is that the radiative corrections that it generates are renormalizable .",
    "thus not only would the massive gauge boson sector of the theory be renormalizable ( because of the higgs mechanism ) , the higgs sector itself would be too .",
    "moreover , with an elementary higgs field electroweak radiative corrections are not only finite , they are straightforwardly calculable .",
    "however , having an elementary higgs field also has some disturbing consequences .",
    "first we note that the radiative corrections in the higgs sector itself lead to a quadratically divergent higgs self energy .",
    "while this divergence can be made finite by renormalization , there is no control on the ensuing magnitude that the higgs mass would take , as it would be as large as the regulator masses .",
    "these masses could be at the @xmath252 gev or so grandunified scale ( a very large scale if the proton lifetime is to be greater than its current experimental lower bound ) or even at the @xmath253 gev quantum gravitational planck scale .",
    "such mass values are orders of magnitude larger than the higgs boson s observed 125 gev mass .",
    "in order to resolve such a disparity ( known as the hierarchy problem ) it had long been conjectured that there would be a supersymmetry between bosons and fermions , and with fermion and boson loops having opposite signs , a fermionic superparticle could then cancel the quadratic divergence in the higgs self - energy . for it to do so to the degree needed , the fermionic superparticle would need to be close in mass to the higgs boson itself .",
    "however , data from the very same lhc that was used to find the higgs boson have sharply curtailed the possibility that there might be any fermionic superparticle in the requisite mass region . thus the higgs self - energy problem is open at the present time .",
    "a second concern for an elementary higgs field is that the group theoretic structure of the @xmath5 theory does not at all constrain the yukawa couplings of the higgs field to the fundamental fermions .",
    "thus while the higgs field can give masses to the quarks and leptons , those masses are totally unconstrained , with all the yukawa coupling constants being free parameters that one has to introduce by hand .",
    "while embedding @xmath5 in some grandunified theory of the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions , say , might solve this problem , the issue is open at the present time .",
    "a third concern for an elementary higgs field is that , as had been noted earlier , the very minimization of the higgs potential generates an enormous contribution to the cosmological constant . for a one tev or",
    "so higgs mass breaking scale one would get a cosmological constant that would be of order @xmath54 times larger than the standard einstein gravitational theory could possibly permit .",
    "this problem is very severe , and it also is open at the present time .",
    "a fourth concern for an elementary higgs field is an aesthetic , in principle one . at the level of the @xmath28 lagrangian all fermions and gauge bosons are massless and all coupling constants are dimensionless . the only place where there is a fundamental mass scale is in the @xmath254 term in the higgs potential",
    ". it would be much more natural and elegant if this @xmath255 scale were to be generated dynamically in a then scale invariant theory that would then possess no fundamental scale at all .",
    "it is thus of interest to note that all of these concerns can be addressed if the higgs boson is dynamical .",
    "moreover , there already are two working models that we know of in which the symmetry breaking actually is done dynamically , the bcs theory , and the generation of a goldstone boson pion in qcd . in the bcs theory the symmetry breaking",
    "is done by a dynamically generated nonzero fermion bilinear vacuum expectation value @xmath256 in a theory that only contains electrons and phonons while not containing any elementary scalar fields whatsoever . for the pion",
    ", we note that the qcd local color @xmath257 lagrangian of quarks and gluons possesses a global chiral flavor symmetry .",
    "this chiral symmetry is broken dynamically by qcd dynamics to yield a goldstone pion .",
    "this pion then acquires a mass via the weak interaction since the electroweak @xmath5 action breaks the flavor chiral symmetry intrinsically at the level of weak interaction lagrangian itself , to thereby make the chiral favor symmetry be only an approximate one .",
    "the generation of a goldstone pion in qcd is particularly of interest since unlike the njl model , in the qcd case it occurs in a theory that is renormalizable , and in which all coupling constants are dimensionless and all quark and gluon masses are zero at the level of the lagrangian . in such a theory not only is there no fundamental @xmath254 term , there is not even any elementary @xmath9 at all , and the theory is scale invariant at the level of the lagrangian .",
    "so let us suppose that dynamical symmetry breaking occurs in some renormalizable yang - mills theory of interacting massless fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "in such a case , if nonzero gauge boson masses are produced by a dynamical higgs mechanism , renormalizability would not be impaired since bound state production in a renormalizable theory does not violate renormalizability . without needing to specify any particular such yang - mills theory ( i.e. without needing to specify the group structure or the specific matter content of the theory ) , we note that if the symmetry breaking occurs at all , then since all such theories have no divergences higher than logarithmic , there will be no quadratic divergence associated with any dynamical scalar bound states that might be produced .",
    "thus with a dynamical higgs boson there is no higgs self - energy hierarchy problem at all .",
    "as regards the couplings of fermions to the higgs boson , these couplings are given as the residues of the dynamical poles in the requisite channels .",
    "thus they are determined by the theory itself and are not free parameters at all . to see how things work ,",
    "let us consider the njl model as a stand - in for a renormalizable field theory . in its @xmath258 and @xmath259 channels",
    "there are scalar and pseudoscalar bound states , and near the respective poles the scattering amplitudes behave as : @xmath260 we thus identify the yukawa coupling of the scalar and psuedoscalar bound states to a fermion anti - fermion pair to be @xmath261 and @xmath262 , where the values of @xmath263 and @xmath264 are not fixed by hand but by the theory itself , with the equality of @xmath263 and @xmath264 that is found reflecting the underlying chiral symmetry of the njl theory .",
    "as regards the cosmological constant problem , we had noted above that the self - consistent mean - field treatment of the njl model automatically generated an @xmath218 term in the mean - field action , with this term serving to cancel the quadratic divergence in the vacuum energy .",
    "unlike the situation with an elementary higgs field where there is no control of the vacuum energy , with dynamical symmetry breaking we see that contributions to the vacuum energy are potentially controllable . breaking symmetries dynamically thus provides a good starting point to address the cosmological constant problem .     via an infinite summation of massless graphs with",
    "zero - momentum dressed @xmath213 insertions.,width=316,height=124 ]     developed as an infinite summation of massless graphs , each with two dressed @xmath213 insertions carrying momentum @xmath243 ( shown as external lines ) , with all other dressed @xmath213 insertions carrying zero momentum.,width=326,height=76 ]    a discussion of how things might work in the renormalizable situation can be found in the conformal gravity and conformal symmetry studies given in @xcite and @xcite . in these studies conformal symmetry is used to address the cosmological constant problem  with the cosmological constant being zero if the conformal symmetry is unbroken , while being constrained in a phenomenologically acceptable way if the conformal symmetry is broken dynamically .",
    "in addition , the conformal symmetry is realized via scaling with anomalous dimensions , with the green s function associated with the insertion of a soft @xmath180 into the inverse fermion propagator being found to behave as @xmath265 .",
    "with such a form the dynamical dimension of @xmath180 is reduced from three to two , and the dynamical dimension of @xmath266 ^ 2 $ ] is reduced from six to a renormalizable four .",
    "the four - fermion theory is thus made renormalizable by dressing its point vertices in this particular way , with the point - coupled vertices of the njl model with @xmath267 being replaced by dressed vertices with @xmath265 . with the @xmath265 dressing all infinities in the particle physics sector are now under control , and with conformal gravity being a renormalizable ( and unitary @xcite ) theory , all infinities in both particle physics and gravity ( and thus the infinite negative energy sea contribution to the cosmological constant ) are now under control .    for our purposes here we note that once one dresses the vertices as exhibited in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , quantities such @xmath268 will develop a non - trivial momentum dependence , so that @xmath268 will then have a discontinuity in the complex @xmath269 plane . in consequence of this",
    ", the pole in @xmath270 will no longer be at the particle - antiparticle threshold but will instead be above threshold and not be on the real @xmath269 axis @xcite .",
    "the dynamically induced higgs boson must thus be an unstable above - threshold resonance and have a nonzero width .",
    "it is in this respect that a composite higgs boson will most differ from an elementary one , with the width of the higgs boson thus being a diagnostic that could potentially distinguish an elementary higgs boson from a dynamical one .",
    "however , if the higgs boson is to be dynamical , the dynamical theory in which it is to be generated would then have to be able to reproduce those aspects of the radiative correction structure associated with an elementary higgs field theory that have been tested .",
    "to this end we note that following gaussian integration on a dummy scalar field variable @xmath271 and a dummy vector field variable @xmath272 , the path integral representation of the generator @xmath273 of fermion green s functions in the njl theory can be written as : @xmath274[d\\psi]\\exp\\left[i\\int d^4x \\left(i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi-\\frac{g}{2}(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^2+\\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int [ d\\bar{\\psi}][d\\psi ] [ d\\sigma][dv_{\\mu}]\\exp\\bigg{[}i\\int d^4x \\bigg{(}i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi-\\frac{g}{2}(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^2+\\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{g}-\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\right)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(h v_{\\mu}-\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma)(h v^{\\mu}-\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma)+\\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta\\bigg{)}\\bigg { ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int [ d\\bar{\\psi}][d\\psi ] [ d\\sigma][dv_{\\mu}]\\exp\\bigg{[}i\\int d^4x \\bigg{(}i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi-\\sigma\\bar{\\psi}\\psi + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2g}+ \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(h^2 v_{\\mu}v^{\\mu}-h\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma v^{\\mu}-hv_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma + \\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma)+\\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta\\bigg{)}\\bigg { ] } , \\label{m44}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath275 is a constant . on setting @xmath275 to zero ,",

    "the perturbative expansions in the two theories are in one to one correspondence . however , in this scalar field theory there is no source term @xmath277 for the scalar field ( in a true fundamental higgs field lagrangian there would be such a source term ) , and thus the scalar field theory only generates green s functions with external fermion legs and does not generate any green s functions with external scalar field legs .",
    "thus in the dynamical higgs case one can generate the fermion green s functions using an elementary higgs field theory in which the elementary higgs field only role is to contribute internally in feynman diagrams and never to appear in any external legs .",
    "in such a case , the all - order iteration of internal @xmath271 exchange diagrams then generates the dynamical higgs and goldstone poles in @xmath270 and @xmath278 .",
    "moreover , as we had noted above , the dynamically generated higgs boson will be an above - threshold resonance and have a nonzero width . since a fundamental higgs boson can contribute both off shell and on shell while the dummy field @xmath271 can only contribute off shell ,",
    "it is in the on - shell behavior in the higgs sector and through the width that it would acquire that one may ultimately be able to distinguish between an elementary higgs boson and a dynamical one .",
    "with the vacuum of quantum field theory being a dynamical one , in a sense einstein s ether has reemerged . only it has reemerged not as the mechanical ether of classical physics that was excluded by the michelson - morley experiment , but as a dynamical , quantum - field - theoretic one full of dirac s negative energy particles , an infinite number of such particles whose dynamics can spontaneously break symmetries .",
    "the type of physics that would be taking place in this vacuum depends on how symmetries are broken , i.e. on whether the breaking is by elementary higgs fields or by dynamical ones .",
    "if the symmetry is broken by an elementary higgs field , then the higgs boson gives mass to fundamental gauge bosons and fermions alike .",
    "however , if the breaking is done dynamically , then it is the structure of an ordered vacuum itself that generates masses , with the mass generation mechanism in turn then producing the higgs boson . in the dynamical case",
