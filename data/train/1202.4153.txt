    "here are some common claims .",
    "the founders of infinitesimal calculus were working in a vacuum caused by an absence of a satisfactory number system .",
    "the incoherence of infinitesimals was effectively criticized by berkeley as so much hazy metaphysical mysticism .",
    "dalembert s visionary anticipation of the rigorisation of analysis was ahead of his time .",
    "cauchy took first steps toward replacing infinitesimals by rigor and epsilontics , in particular giving a modern definition of continuity .",
    "cauchy s false 1821 version of the  sum theorem \" was corrected by him in 1853 by adding the hypothesis of uniform convergence .",
    "weierstrass finally rigorized analysis and thereby eliminated infinitesimals from mathematics .",
    "dedekind discovered  the essence of continuity \" , which is captured by his cuts .",
    "one of the spectacular successes of the rigorous analysis was the mathematical justification of dirac s `` delta functions '' .",
    "robinson developed a new theory of infinitesimals in the 1960s , but his approach has little to do with historical infinitesimals .",
    "lakatos pursued an ideological agenda of kuhnian relativism and fallibilism , inapplicable to mathematics .",
    "each of the above ten claims is in error , as we argue in the next ten sections ( cf .",
    "crowe @xcite ) .",
    "the historical fact of the dominance of the view of analysis as being based on the real numbers to the exclusion of infinitesimals , is beyond dispute .",
    "one could ask oneself why this historical fact is so ; some authors have criticized mathematicians for adhering to an approach that others consider less appropriate . in the present text",
    ", we will _ not _ be concerned with either of these issues .",
    "rather , we will be concerned with another issue , namely , why is it that traditional historical scholarship has been inadequate in indicating that alternative views have been around .",
    "we will also be concerned with documenting instances of tendentious interpretation and the attendant distortion in traditional evaluation of key figures from mathematical history .",
    "felix klein clearly acknowledged the existence of a parallel , infinitesimal approach to foundations .",
    "having outlined the developments in real analysis associated with weierstrass and his followers , klein pointed out in  1908 that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the scientific mathematics of today is built upon the series of developments which we have been outlining . but an essentially different conception of infinitesimal calculus has been running parallel with this [ conception ] through the centuries ( klein @xcite ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    such a different conception , according to klein , `` harks back to old metaphysical speculations concerning the structure of the continuum according to which this was made up of [  ] infinitely small parts '' ( ibid . ) .",

    "a century before newton and leibniz , simon stevin ( stevinus ) sought to break with an ancient greek heritage of working exclusively with relations among natural numbers , ; thus , @xmath3 was not a number , nor are the fractions : ratios were relations , not numbers . consequently , stevin had to spend time arguing that the unit ( @xmath4 ) _ was _ a number . ] and developed an approach capable of representing both `` discrete '' number ( @xmath5 ) composed of units ( @xmath6 ) and continuous magnitude ( @xmath7 ) of geometric origin .",

    ", rational essence entails a suppression of infinitesimals : a pair of distinct non - rational numbers can define the same dedekind cut on  @xmath8 , such as  @xmath70 and  @xmath71 with  @xmath38 infinitesimal ; but one can not have such a pair if one postulates the rational essence of continuity , as dedekind does .",
    "dedekind s technical work on the foundations of analysis has been justly celebrated ( see d.  fowler @xcite ) .",
    "whereas everyone before dedekind had _ assumed _ that operations such as powers , roots , and logarithms can be performed , he was the first to show how these operations can be defined , and shown to be coherent , in the realm of the real numbers ( see dedekind @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the nature of his interpretive speculations about what does or does not constitute the  essence \" of continuity , is a separate issue .",
    "for over a hundred years now , many mathematicians have been making the assumption that space conforms to dedekind s idea of  the essence of continuity \" , which in arithmetic translates into the numerical assertion that two numbers should be equal if and only if they define the same dedekind cut on the rationals . such an assumption rules out infinitesimals . in the context of the hyperreal number system ,",
    "it amounts to an application of the standard part function ( see appendix  [ rival2 ] ) , which forces the collapse of the entire halo ( cluster of infinitely close , or adequal , points ) to a single point .",
    "the formal / axiomatic transformation of mathematics accomplished at the end of the 19th century created a specific foundational framework for analysis .",
    "weierstrass s followers raised a philosophical prejudice against infinitesimals to the status of an axiom .",
    "dedekind s `` essence of continuity '' was , in essence , a way of steamrolling infinitesimals out of existence .    in 1977 , e. nelson  @xcite created a set - theoretic framework ( enriching zfc ) where the usual construction of the reals produces a number system containing entities that behave like infinitesimals .",
    "thus , the elimination thereof was not the only way to achieve rigor in analysis as advertized at the time , but rather a decision to develop analysis in just one specific way .",
    "a prevailing sentiment today is that one of the spectacular successes of the rigorous analysis was the justification of delta functions , originally introduced informally by to p.  dirac ( 19021984 ) , in terms of distribution theory . but",
    "was it originally introduced informally by dirac ?",
    "in fact , fourier @xcite and cauchy exploited the `` dirac '' delta function over a century earlier .",
    "cauchy defined such functions in terms of infinitesimals ( see ltzen @xcite and laugwitz  @xcite ) .",
    "a function of the type generally attributed to dirac was specifically described by cauchy in 1827 in terms of infinitesimals .",
    "more specifically , cauchy uses a unit - impulse , infinitely tall , infinitely narrow delta function , as an integral kernel .",
    "thus , in 1827 , cauchy used infinitesimals in his definition of a `` dirac '' delta function @xcite . here",
    "cauchy uses infinitesimals  @xmath44 and  @xmath72 , where  @xmath44 is , in modern terms , the `` scale parameter '' of the `` cauchy distribution '' , whereas  @xmath72 gives the size of the interval of integration .",
    "cauchy wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ moreover one finds , denoting by  @xmath44 ,  @xmath72 two infinitely small numbers , @xmath73 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    ( see cauchy @xcite ) .",
    "such a formula extracts the value of a function  @xmath69 at a point  @xmath48 by integrating  @xmath69 against a delta function defined in terms of an infinitesimal parameter  @xmath44 ( see and laugwitz @xcite ) .",
    "the expression @xmath74 ( for real  @xmath44 ) is known as the _ cauchy distribution _ in probability theory .",
    "the function is called the probability density function .",
    "a cauchy distribution with an infinitesimal scale parameter produces a function with dirac - delta function behavior , exploited by cauchy already in 1827 in work on fourier series and evaluation of singular integrals .",
    "is there continuity between historical infinitesimals and robinson s theory ?",
    "historically , infinitesimals have often been represented by null sequences .",
    "thus , cauchy speaks of a variable quantity as becoming an infinitesimal in 1821 , and his variable quantities from that year are generally understood to be sequences of discrete values ( on the other hand , in his 1823 he used continuous variable quantities ) .",
    "infinitesimal - enriched fields can in fact be obtained from sequences , by means of an ultrapower construction , where a null sequence generates an infinitesimal .",
    "such an approach was popularized by luxemburg @xcite in 1962 , and is based on the work by e. hewitt @xcite from 1948 . even in robinson",
    "s approach  @xcite based on the compactness theorem , a null sequence is present , though well - hidden , namely in the countable collection of axioms  @xmath75 .",
    "thus , null sequences provide both a cognitive and a technical link between historical infinitesimals thought of as variable quantities taking discrete values , on the one hand , and modern infinitesimals , on the other ( see katz & tall @xcite ) .",
    "leibniz s heuristic _ law of continuity _ was implemented mathematically as o s theorem and later as the _ transfer principle _ over the hyperreals ( see appendix  [ rival2 ] ) , while leibniz s heuristic law of homogeneity ( see leibniz @xcite ) and bos @xcite ) was implemented mathematically as the standard part function ( see katz and sherry @xcite ) .",
