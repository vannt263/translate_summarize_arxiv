    "cooperation is ubiquitous in nature , and the cooperative integration of lower - level entities into higher - level units has been vital for the development of life on earth @xcite .",
    "while cooperation in the broad sense only implies joint action , the term is often used more strictly to describe situations in which cooperators help others at a cost to themselves .",
    "these interactions are typically vulnerable to cheating and exploitation by defectors that benefit without making costly cooperative contributions of their own .",
    "cheating and exploitation are observed in viruses @xcite , bacteria @xcite , yeast @xcite , amoebas @xcite , fish @xcite , and humans @xcite .",
    "how cooperation can persist in the presence of cheaters is not obvious . at first glance",
    "it often appears as though the fitness of cheaters exceeds that of cooperators .",
    "indeed , the well - known tragedy of the commons @xcite shows that even when cooperation is beneficial for a group , selection acting at the individual level often eliminates cooperation altogether .",
    "this has attracted significant scientific interest throughout the last decades , with explanations proposed for the origin and maintenance of cooperation falling into three main categories .",
    "first , kin selection @xcite successfully explains many forms of cooperation among genetically related individuals .",
    "second , selection at the level of groups @xcite , through which subpopulations with non - cooperative individuals are at a reproductive disadvantage , promotes cooperation under certain conditions .",
    "third , direct and indirect reciprocation have been shown to foster cooperation @xcite .",
    "these alternative mechanisms are further discussed in @xcite .",
    "most game - theoretical studies of cooperation fall into the third category described above and revolve around a game known as the prisoner s dilemma @xcite . the classic variant of this game is played by two players choosing between two pure strategies , cooperation or defection , but the game can be generalized to an arbitrary number of players @xcite and to continuous levels of cooperative contributions @xcite . in the latter case , cooperative investments vary continuously and are represented by real numbers , denoted here by @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the payoff of an @xmath2-strategist facing an @xmath1-strategist is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 areq increasing functions that quantify the benefits and costs of cooperative investments . since cooperative investments",
    "do not directly benefit the acting individual , defection is the rational choice when the game is played only once . in many cases , however , it is more reasonable to assume that all players benefit equally from cooperative investments .",
    "for example , the digestive enzymes produced by a cell of the yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ can be used by all nearby cells , including the producing cell itself @xcite . likewise , while the stalk produced by the amoeba _ dictyostelium discoideum _ can be exploited by cheaters , it also vitally benefits the cooperators .",
    "further examples of processes resulting in shared benefits are cooperative hunting , vigilance behavior , group foraging , and parental care @xcite",
    ". situations in which individuals directly benefit from cooperative acts that they perform can be described by the snowdrift game @xcite , synonymously known as the hawk - dove game @xcite or chicken game @xcite .",
    "to better understand the evolution of cooperation and defection when all players are benefiting from cooperative investments , @xcite studied the snowdrift game with continuous investments . in this game ,",
    "the payoff of an @xmath0-strategist facing an @xmath1-strategist is @xmath6 , where the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are chosen so that cooperation is more successful than defection in groups of defectors , but defection is advantageous in groups of cooperators .",
    "consequently , cooperation in the snowdrift game always develops to some intermediate degree .",
    "however , assuming small mutations in continuous cooperative investments , @xcite showed that this gradual buildup of cooperation was sometimes followed by the emergence of cheaters with little or no cooperative investments , while the remaining cooperators became even more cooperative .",
    "similar results have been obtained by @xcite in the context of the social amoeba _",
    "dictyostelium_. when starvation is imminent , one or several strains of this amoeba aggregate to form fruiting bodies that enable spore dispersal @xcite .",
    "a strain , however , may forego investing into the stalk of the fruiting body and instead take a free ride on the investments of other strains . @xcite",
    "modeled this process with spores as players and with the investment of strains into the construction of stalks as strategies . in this model ,",
    "the payoff of an @xmath0-strategist facing an @xmath1-strategist is multiplicative , @xmath7 , with @xmath4 an increasing and @xmath5 a decreasing function of cooperative investments .",
    "they showed that fluctuation in player numbers resulted in evolutionary branching and in the subsequent emergence and coexistence of low - investing cheaters and high - investing cooperators .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     figure  [ fig2 ] depicts two situations in which variation in group size naturally occurs .",
    "first , movement and infrequent interactions among nearby players leads to a class of games in which groups are formed through the overlap of interaction zones .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ fig2]a is most easily interpreted in terms of binary interactions , the interaction strengths among players in general depend on factors such as their distance .",
    "second , fig .",
    "[ fig2]b shows how games are formed when players are repeatedly distributed onto patches of different sizes , giving rise to distinct groups of interacting players .",
    "significant variation in patch size leads to a wide distribution of the number of players in a group .",
    "this situation arises , for example , when spores or seeds are dispersed over an area with fragmented patches of suitable habitat and subsequently interact within each patch .",
    "our analysis below encompasses both situations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .      when a group of @xmath8 players has been formed , we assume that each player contributes an amount or effort @xmath9 towards the group s total effort @xmath10 .",
    "the contribution @xmath9 is the strategy or trait value of a player and may optionally be constrained to an interval , e.g. @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the payoff @xmath12 for a focal individual playing strategy @xmath9 in a group of players with strategies @xmath13 may depend on the focal player s own contribution @xmath9 , on the focal player s share of the total effort , @xmath14 , and on the number of individuals @xmath8 in the group . by choosing @xmath15 appropriately , we recover all traditionally studied cooperation games as special cases .",
    "for example , the two - player prisoner s dilemma is obtained by choosing @xmath16 with increasing functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the @xmath8-player public - good ( joint - effort ) game by choosing @xmath17 with a positive factor @xmath18 .",
    "we say that benefits and costs are additively or multiplicatively separable if , respectively , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 . for a fixed number of players , additively and multiplicatively",
    "separable benefits and costs give rise to equivalent evolutionary dynamics , as the multiplicatively separable payoff is additively separable on a logarithmic scale .",
    "importantly , however , the evolutionary dynamics of these games is not equivalent in games with fluctuating player numbers , as will become clear in sect .",
    "[ sec2.3 ] below .",
    "the distinction between additive and multiplicative payoff structures will play an important role in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] when we examine the effect of fluctuating group size on the tragedy of the commune .",
    "when players pay a cost for making a cooperative contribution and benefit from their group s total effort , it is natural to assume that the payoff @xmath15 decreases with @xmath9 and increases with @xmath21 , @xmath22 where the subscripts in @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the partial derivatives of @xmath15 with respect to its first or second argument , respectively . since this assumption",
    "is not needed for most of the arguments below , it will be invoked only when analyzing the sign of mixed derivatives of multiplicative payoff functions .",
    "based on the general specification of payoffs for players participating in cooperation games provided above , we now introduce the resultant demographic dynamics describing how player abundances change over time . for this",
    "we assume that , in successive generations , players are randomly distributed over groups of different size .",
    "the probability that an individual joins a game with @xmath8 participants is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the fraction of groups with @xmath8 players and @xmath27 is the average number of players in a group .",
    "individuals then interact within the group and produce offspring in proportion to the payoff they received .",
    "survival to the next generation is density - dependent , but independent of trait values . under these assumptions ,",
    "the per capita growth rate of an initially rare mutant strategy @xmath18 in an environment dominated by players with resident strategy @xmath28 is @xmath29 in adaptive dynamics theory , this quantity is known as invasion fitness @xcite . equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , the derivation of which is provided in appendix b , shows that for the cooperation games considered here invasion fitness is given by the excess payoff of a single mutant in groups of residents , relative to the payoff of a resident in groups of residents , averaged according to the probability @xmath30 that the mutant occurs in groups of size @xmath8 .",
    "the determination of this invasion fitness allows us to study the long - term evolution of trait values under mutation and selection @xcite and thus forms the foundation of our analysis of evolutionary dynamics in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) shows that the payoffs players receive in groups of different size are averaged arithmetically .",
    "hence , if two or more group sizes can occur , nonlinear transformations of the scale on which payoffs are measured are not possible , since they would distort the weighted average .",
    "thus , only when the number of players is fixed , does a transformation of payoffs to a logarithmic scale enable a reduction from multiplicatively separable payoff structures to additively separable payoff structures .",
    "when mutational steps are small and rare , resident communities will successively be replaced by invading mutants with similar strategies and positive invasion fitness .",
    "driven by directional selection , this process eventually ceases when evolution reaches either a boundary strategy at which constraints prevent further evolution , or an interior strategy at which selection pressures vanish .",
    "strategies of the latter type are called evolutionarily singular ; in their vicinity , an initially monomorphic population may experience disruptive selection and thus become dimorphic .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates how directional selection leads to a singular strategy at which selection is either disruptive ( left panel ) or stabilizing ( right panel ) .    assuming a univariate trait and at most one interior singular strategy , there are only six qualitatively different configurations of selection pressures , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]c , there is no interior singular strategy and gradual adaptation leads to a monomorphic population of full defectors ( tragedy of the commons ) or full cooperators , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d , the interior singular strategy is not convergence stable ( i.e. , it is a repellor of monomorphic evolution ) .",
    "this results in evolutionary bistability , so that the evolutionary outcome depends on the initial condition ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , the interior singular strategy is convergence stable ( i.e. , it is an attractor of monomorphic evolution ) , so that gradual adaptation leads to intermediate cooperative investments . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c and [ fig3]d , selection near the interior singular strategy can be either stabilizing or disruptive ( i.e. , the interior singular strategy is either an attractor or a repellor of dimorphic evolution , respectively ) .",
    "if selection is stabilizing , it results in a locally evolutionarily stable strategy .",
    "if selection is disruptive , the population can become dimorphic ( tragedy of the commune ) .",
    "b ) , or in evolutionary branching and thus a strategy dimorphism if selection is disruptive ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . an interior singular strategy that is not convergence stable ( panel d ) separates two basins of attraction for high and low cooperative investments , respectively .",
    "the levels of cooperative investment increase along the horizontal axes , and vertical lines indicate the lowest possible and highest possible cooperative investments .",
    "whether such limits exist is immaterial for the classification .",
    "circles depict interior singular strategies where directional selection ceases .",
    "filled circles represent convergence stable singular strategies .",
    "the dashed lines beneath panels b and d indicate whether selection is stabilizing or disruptive.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the initial growth rate of a rare mutant player with strategy @xmath18 in an environment dominated by players with strategy @xmath28 , as given in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , allows us to study the long - term consequences of small mutations and natural selection @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we first study how fluctuations in group size affect the location of the singular strategy .",
    "we show that when the payoff function does not have an explicit dependence on group size , the location of the singular strategy is invariant under fluctuations in group size . for two important classes of such payoff functions , with additively or multiplicatively separable benefits and costs ,",
    "we investigate how fluctuations in group size affect the potential for evolutionary branching and thus for the tragedy of the commune .",
    "the selection gradient @xmath31 is defined as the derivative of the invasion fitness @xmath32 with respect to @xmath18 evaluated at @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , the function @xmath34 contains information about which nearby strategies can invade a monomorphic population of players with cooperative investment @xmath28 .",
    "when the selection gradient is positive ( negative ) more ( less ) cooperative strategies can invade .",
    "an invading strategy generically replaces the resident strategy , so that the population again becomes monomorphic @xcite .    from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , we derive the following expression for the selection gradient , @xmath35 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , again denote the partial derivatives of @xmath15 with respect to its first or second argument",
    ", @xmath36 is the average number of players in a group , @xmath26 is the probability that a group with @xmath8 players is formed , and @xmath37 is the selection gradient for a fixed group size @xmath8 , @xmath38 more details on the derivation of the selection pressure are provided in appendix b.    we now introduce @xmath39 , so that we can apply jensen s inequality , according to which the average of a convex function evaluated at arbitrary arguments is always larger or equal to that function evaluated at the average argument .",
    "thus , if @xmath40 is convex ( accelerating ) as a function of @xmath8 , then @xmath41 we can thus see that fluctuations in group size imply a greater selection gradient .",
    "this means that cooperation will be established more rapidly and reach higher levels when the group size @xmath8 of interacting players is variable around @xmath42 , than when games are played in groups with a fixed size of @xmath42 players .",
    "if @xmath40 is concave ( decelerating ) as a function of @xmath8 , the opposite is true : fluctuations in player numbers then reduce the speed of evolutionary adjustments in cooperative investments .",
    "since , as we have now seen , fluctuations in group size typically affect the selection pressures on cooperative investments , such fluctuations can also shift the location of interior singular strategies .",
    "if fluctuations in group size shift singular strategies below the natural limit of zero cooperative investments , they prevent the evolution of cooperation altogether .",
    "moreover , if fluctuations in group size shift singular strategies beyond the lowest possible or highest possible cooperative investments , they can prevent evolutionary bistability ( if the singular strategy is not convergence stable ) or evolutionary branching ( if the singular strategy is convergence stable , but not locally evolutionarily stable ) .",
    "however , in the following we show that when payoffs depend only on a player s own cooperative investment and on its share of the group s total cooperative investment , selection gradients are independent of the degree of fluctuations in group size around a given average number of players .",
    "we now study the effects of fluctuating group size for games in which payoffs do not explicitly depend on group size , @xmath43 for such games , the selection gradient vanishes for a singular strategy @xmath44 whenever @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the partial derivative of the payoff function @xmath15 with respect to its @xmath47th argument , evaluated at @xmath48 .",
    "since the only feature of the distribution @xmath26 that appears in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is the average number of players , fluctuating group size does not have any effect on the location of the singular strategies .    to understand the evolutionary dynamics of a monomorphic populations with a strategy close to the singular strategy @xmath44",
    ", we need to know whether @xmath44 is convergence stable ( directional selection drives monomorphic populations toward @xmath49 and whether it is locally evolutionarily stable ( selection at @xmath44 is stabilizing ) .",
