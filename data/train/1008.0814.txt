    "carbon nanotubes have many electronic and mechanical applications . their ability to sustain high currents before breaking",
    "was observed in a number of experiments on metallic single - walled nanotubes ( swnt ) adsorbed on a substrate @xcite .",
    "corresponding theoretical work was done in refs .  .",
    "with respect to the mechanical properties , carbon nanotubes belong to the strongest and stiffest materials discovered so far . under stress , a tube will first expand elastically . after reaching the yield point , it undergoes plastic deformations , leaving a permanent deformation . this point was measured at strains around @xmath1 for nanotubes with diameter @xmath2 nm depending on the chirality @xcite .",
    "when the effective temperature of the nanotube caused by the intense electron - phonon scattering at a high bias voltage ( we assume in this paper that the system is not externally heated ) exceeds the activation barriers of defects , large spiral - like defect stripes are created along the tube @xcite .",
    "these defect stripes correspond to missing lattice plane pieces in the crystal .",
    "the missing atoms of these plane pieces are rearranged at the end points of the nanotube in such a way that a superelongation of swnts of up to @xmath3 before cracking is reached . in ref .",
    ", we have developed a theory for this effect in a simplified crystal model .",
    "finally , when the effective temperature due to the applied bias voltage is lower than the activation barrier the system responds to the external stress with large non - homogeneous defect pile ups or immediately bond - breaking depending on the physical surrounding @xcite .",
    "this leads then to necking of the swnt . here",
    ", we will not address the current - voltage characteristic in this regime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse the electrical properties in the stress ranges where nanotubes show a homogeneous behavior in space , i.e. , in the elastic regime of small elongation , and in the superelongation regime .",
    "we will first discuss the elastic regime , and the superelongation regime will be discussed at the end .",
    "if subjected to an external homogeneous stress , a nanotube responds with a homogeneous strain .",
    "this results in modifications in the bond lengths and leads , via the electron - phonon interaction , to a gap in the electron spectrum of metallic swnts .",
    "this strongly modifies the current - voltage characteristic , and represents , therefore , a promising effect for building sensitive stress sensors .    on a substrate ,",
    "the current increases with voltage , whereas for suspended swnts it decreases , i.e. , it shows a small negative differential conductance at high voltages @xcite .",
    "similarly , we will find here a negative differential conductance which is now very large for a swnt adsorbed on a substrate under external stress at bias voltages of around @xmath4v .",
    "the energy levels of electrons in a nanotube form one - dimensional bands in the graphene brillouin zone around the @xmath5 and @xmath6 points . for metallic swnts , there are two energy bands corresponding to right- and left - moving electrons which cross at these points .",
    "we assume here that the diameter of the nanotube is so small that electron excitations to higher bands are negligible . for example",
    "this approximation is valid at bias voltages @xmath7v for nanotubes with diameter @xmath8 nm . these diameters are typical in present day current - voltage experiments @xcite .",
    "but we expect the validity of the approximation even beyond this value since electron scattering to higher bands is effectively forward due to the band edges where electrons reverse their direction",
    ". note that we use in our numerical calculations below scattering values for nanotubes with a diameter of @xmath9 nm @xcite .    in order to calculate the current - voltage characteristic at high bias voltage",
    "we will use the semi - classical boltzmann equation for electrons and phonons .",
    "the various scattering mechanisms between electrons , phonons and impurities will be discussed first in sect .",
    "ii . then we will discuss in sect .",
    "iii the effect of strain on the wavefunctions and the energy spectrum of the electrons in the nanotube .",
    "this leads to modifications in the electron - phonon scattering times .",
    "section iv introduces the different boltzmann equations for the electrons and phonons which we use in order to calculate the current - voltage characteristic .",
    "the results of this calculation will be discuss in sect .",
    "v ending up with a conclusion in sect .",
    "the method we use here to calculate the current - voltage characteristic of metallic nanotubes is based on the semi - classical boltzmann equation . within this method",
    "quantum interference corrections to the conductance are not taken into account @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown numerically that this correction to the conductivity is negligible above room temperature for single - walled carbon nanotubes without structural defects due to phonon scattering decoherence mechanisms @xcite .",
    "this temperature is immediately reached through electron - optical phonon and further optical phonon - acoustic phonon scattering in nanotubes under high bias voltage .    at low voltages",
    "innervalley elastic scattering , which consists of acoustic phonon scattering ( in the quasi - elastic limit ) and impurity scattering , is most relevant .",
    "we neglect electron - electron collisions . at higher voltages",
    "inelastic scattering between the electrons and optical phonons , which then leads to intervalley scattering , becomes relevant .",
    "this scattering process leads at high bias voltage to the creation of hot optical phonons , which are then no longer in thermal equilibrium with the environment @xcite .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that we have to consider besides the electrons also phonons in the semi - classical boltzmann approach .",
    "the hopping between an electron in the @xmath5 valley and the other at the @xmath10-valley is mediated by zone - boundary optical @xmath11 @xmath5-phonons where only kekul type of lattice distortions couple to the electronic system @xcite . on the other hand jumps of electrons within the same valley",
    "are mediated by zone - center @xmath12 @xmath13-phonons @xcite .",
    "the optical phonons decay to lower lying secondary acoustic phonons by phonon - phonon scattering @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with numerical calculations and experiments @xcite .",
    "this spontaneous gap generation is _ not _ seen by computer calculations in graphene @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenvalues @xmath34 show an important exception : the spectrum remains gapless @xcite for a metallic swnt with @xmath35 known as armchair nanotube , where the homogeneous axial stress obeys @xmath36 . from this and the discussion below it is clear that armchair nanotubes show only a small effect on the current - voltage characteristic by an applied external stress . for zigzag swnts , for which one has @xmath37",
    ", we obtain the maximal gap value for a given applied axial external stress .",
    "let us now discuss the current - voltage characteristic due to strain .",
    "for a formerly metallic nanotube , we obtain that the energy band and the electron - phonon scattering times are modified . indeed , both depend effectively on the gap parameter @xmath38 which is itself a function of the strain and the chiral angle of the nanotube .",
    "we neglect here modifications of the eigenfunctions above due to @xmath39 as this leads effectively only to small momentum shifts of the zone boundary phonon velocities .",
    "the corresponding modifications of the current - voltage characteristic are small due to the fact that the effective phonon mean free path is much smaller than the swnt length .",
    "this has been checked numerically .",
    "we now discuss the modifications of the effective electron - phonon scattering times due to the wavefunction modifications under stress .",
    "we restrict ourselves first to the @xmath5 valley and zone - center phonon scattering .",
    "the results for intervalley scattering are mentioned below eq .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the current - voltage characteristic of swnts without band gap @xcite we have to take backward scattering ( inner and interband ) and interband forward scattering into account .",
    "interband scattering leads , for example , to the result that the conduction band can be filled with electrons by phonon absorption or depleted by phonon emission .",
    "therefore , we should take into account that we have from the beginning electrons ( holes ) injected in the conduction ( valence ) band in the swnt by a non - zero lead temperature . without interband scattering , only these electrons and the corresponding holes contribute to the current ( see the accompanying discussion to eq .",
    "( [ 50 ] ) ) .",
    "the electronic zone - center phonon scattering hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the nearest - neighbour distance in the lattice and @xmath42 was determined in ref .",
    "[ ] by density functional methods for metallic swnts .",
    "next we calculate the momentum - dependent electron - phonon transition matrix elements @xmath43 , which are proportional to the effective electron - phonon scattering times . in the following , we mention for which type of phonons , i.e. longitudinal ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) or transversal ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , the matrix element @xmath48 is non - vanishing : @xmath49 the matrix element ( [ 340 ] ) comes from interband forward scattering , which means @xmath50 , with transverse optical phonons ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "for innerband backward scattering , i.e. @xmath52 , this non - zero matrix element is mediated by longitudinal optical phonons ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the non - zero matrix element ( [ 350 ] ) come from interband backward scattering with longitudinal optical phonons ( @xmath53 ) if the gap is small ( @xmath54 ) , and from transversal optical phonons ( @xmath55 ) if the gap is large ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "note that ( [ 340 ] ) and ( [ 350 ] ) become exact for large and small gaps and are approximate for intermediate gap values .",
    "note also that in the present approximation , ( [ 340 ] ) , ( [ 350 ] ) , the backward scattering matrix elements do not depend on the stress , i.e. , we can set @xmath57 .",
    "in section ii we introduced a two - valley model for the scattering mechanisms of the swnt under bias voltage . in the following , we use the approximation of an effective one - valley model coupled to only one sort of optical phonons .",
    "in fact , this was already used by us in ref .  [ ] to calculate analytically the current - voltage characteristic of unstrained swnts with non - reflecting leads .",
    "this is a simplification of the two - valley boltzmann approach where scattering between the valleys is mediated by zone - boundary and zone - center optical phonons @xcite which we discussed in sect .",
    "the latter model leads to current - voltage characteristic of unstrained swnts @xcite which are in good accordance with experiments .",
    "our one - valley approximation is justified by the fact that the optical frequencies of the zone - center phonons and zone - boundary phonons , and also the electron - phonon coupling in the phononic sectors are rather similar .",

    "this follows also immediately from the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian for acoustic phonons in ref .   which we used above in the derivation of ( [ 300 ] ) and ( [ 310 ] ) .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the current - voltage characteristic of a swnt in the superelongation regime . in ref .",
    "we obtain that with increasing external stress defect stripes are created with increasing lengths for increasing stress .",
    "this is seen by a kink motion at the boundary surface of the swnt in transmission electron microscope pictures @xcite .",
    "the number of these stripes is proportional to the external stress whose lengths corresponds to missing lattice plane pieces in the crystal . in first approximation",
    "we expect that the current is given by the electrons running over complete lattice planes .",
    "the electrons which run over incomplete lattice planes are completely backscattered and these do not contribute to the current .",
    "for those electrons which run over the complete lattice planes we further have to consider the linear elasticity current corrections which we have discussed at length above .",
    "all this means that for armchair swnts , which do not show a stress dependent gap we expect a linear decreasing current curve as a function of the external stress .",
    "such a behavior is in fact experimentally observed in ref .  .",
    "we have calculated the current - voltage characteristic of metallic carbon nanotubes under homogeneous axial stress in the linear elastic regime lying on a substrate by means of a semi - empirical boltzmann equation for electrons and phonons .",
    "we have found that the stress leads to an energy gap which , causes a large negative differential conductance at @xmath154 .",
    "moreover this negative differential conductance is largest at small stress just after the gap is opened , getting smaller with a larger stress applied .",
    "materials with such a behavior are very useful for the activation and deattenuation of oscillating circuits . for larger voltages at @xmath155 and small stress just after the gap opening we obtain approximately six times smaller current values for the @xmath156 nm nanotube in comparison to the tube without stress .",
    "the corresponding momentum and position averaged optical phonon distribution function is around three to four times smaller .",
    "in addition to the discussion of the current - voltage characteristic in the linear elastic regime we have also discussed modifications of the characteristic in the superelongation regime .    concerning the current - voltage characteristic of large diameter semiconducting nanotubes and graphene nanoribbon",
    ", we have argumented that a qualitative similar differential negative behaviour as for the metallic nanotube should be seen ."
