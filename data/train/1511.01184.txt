    "the stochastic model considered in this paper is a generalization of the stacked contact process introduced in  @xcite and studied analytically in  @xcite .",
    "the stacked contact process is a spatial stochastic process based on the framework of interacting particle systems that describes the co - evolution of a population of hosts together with their symbionts .",
    "individuals are located on the  @xmath1-dimensional integer lattice and interact with their nearest neighbors .",
    "the model assumes that the symbionts can only live in association with their host ( obligate relationship ) and are transmitted both vertically from associated hosts to their offspring and horizontally from associated hosts to nearby unassociated hosts .",
    "the stacked contact process  @xcite also assumes that all the hosts give birth and die at the same rate regardless of whether they are associated with a symbiont or not , meaning that the symbionts have no effect on the fitness of their host .",
    "in contrast , this paper considers the natural generalization of the stacked contact process in which associated and unassociated hosts have different birth rates : symbionts that increase the birth rate of their host , and therefore have a beneficial effect , are referred to as a mutualists , whereas symbionts that decrease the birth rate of their host , and therefore have a detrimental effect , are referred to as pathogens .",
    "formally , the state of the system at time  @xmath2 is a spatial configuration @xmath3 where state  0 means empty , state  1 means occupied by an unassociated host , and state  2 means occupied by a host associated with a symbiont .",
    "letting @xmath4 be the fraction of nearest neighbors of vertex  @xmath5 which are in state  @xmath6 , hosts and symbionts co - evolve according to the spin system whose transition rates at vertex  @xmath5 are given by @xmath7 the first four transition rates indicate that unassociated hosts give birth at rate  @xmath8 , hosts associated with a symbiont give birth at rate  @xmath9 and , regardless of whether they are associated or not , all the hosts die at the normalized rate one .",
    "an offspring produced at  @xmath5 is sent to a vertex chosen uniformly at random among the nearest neighbors but the birth is suppressed when the target site is already occupied , which models competition for space .",
    "the offspring is always of the same type as its parent , indicating that the symbiont is always transmitted vertically .",
    "the process described by these four transitions is the multitype contact process  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the symbiont on the host is modeled by the choice of the two birth rates : the symbiont is @xmath10 the last two transition describe the symbiont dynamics within the host population . the symbiont spreads to adjacent unassociated hosts at rate  @xmath11 , which corresponds to a horizontal transmission of the symbiont .",
    "finally , hosts associated with a symbiont become unassociated at rate  @xmath12 , which we simply call the recovery rate even when the symbiont is a mutualist .",
    "the stacked contact process  @xcite is obtained by setting  @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to the neutral case in which the symbionts have no effect on the fertility of their hosts , i.e. , all the hosts have the same birth rate .",
    "the analysis of this special case in  @xcite is somewhat facilitated by the fact that the process is attractive and monotone with respect to its parameters .",
    "in contrast , in the general case when  @xmath14 , standard couplings to compare processes starting from different configurations or with different parameters fail to show attractiveness and monotonicity . + * mean - field approximation . * before studying the spatial stochastic process , we first look at its non - spatial deterministic counterpart called mean - field approximation .",
    "this new model is obtained by assuming that the population is well - mixing , which results in a system of ordinary differential equations for the density  @xmath15 of vertices in state  @xmath16 . since  @xmath17 , in order to study the mean - field model , it suffices to focus on two densities , say  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 .",
    "for the transition rates given in  , this system consists of the following coupled equations : @xmath20 clearly the feasible region @xmath21 is forward invariant . in addition",
    ", the line segment  @xmath22 is forward invariant , as well as the line segment  @xmath23 when  @xmath24 .",

    "[ mf:2s ] ( 2s win ) @xmath42 , if  @xmath24 , @xmath43 , does not hold and   holds .",
    "some of these conditions can be intuitively understood as follows :    * if  @xmath37 , then inequality   says that the  2s can invade the  1s in equilibrium . *",
    "if  @xmath24 and  @xmath43 , then inequality   says that the  1s can invade the  2s in equilibrium .",
    "theorem  [ th : mf ] is proved in section  [ sec : mf ] . +",
    "* spatial stochastic process .",
    "* as in the mean - field model , the spatial stochastic process can exhibit four regimes : either the host population survives or goes extinct and , in case of survival , the symbiont population either goes extinct , occupies some but not all hosts , or occupies all hosts .",
    "in addition , when the recovery rate  @xmath34 , survival of associated hosts implies coexistence of associated and unassociated hosts .",
    "as pointed out previously , the stacked contact process obtained by setting  @xmath44 has several nice properties such as attractiveness and monotonicity .",
    "in contrast , these properties do not seem to hold for our process , i.e. , standard couplings fail to show these properties .",
    "coupling can however be used to compare the process with other popular interacting particle systems and collect interesting results .",
    "we start by comparing the process with the basic and the multitype contact processes using simple coupling techniques .",
    "we also show that the process inherits some of the properties of the forest fire model though , because of the lack of monotonicity , this does not simply follow from a standard coupling argument .    in the limiting case",
    "when the recovery rate  @xmath45 , all the symbionts die instantaneously so the host dynamics reduces to the basic contact process @xmath46 there exists a critical value  @xmath47 such that above this critical value the host population survives whereas at and below this critical value the population goes extinct  @xcite .",
    "assume from now on that the recovery rate is finite and let @xmath48 be the process that keeps track of the hosts and the process that keeps track of the hosts associated to a symbionts , respectively .",
    "the transitions for the first process satisfy @xmath49 while  @xmath50 one . in particular , this process can be coupled with the basic contact process described above to deduce that , for all  @xmath51 , @xmath52 this follows from theorem  iii.1.5 in  @xcite , which applies to general two - state spin systems , together with obvious inequalities relating the transition rates of our process and their counterpart for the basic contact process .",
    "similarly , the transitions for the second process satisfy @xmath53 while  @xmath50 at rate  @xmath54 , from which it follows that , for all  @xmath51 , @xmath55 the four parameter regions in   are illustrated in the four diagrams of figure  [ fig:3d - diag ] .",
    "so far , the behavior of the stochastic process agrees with the behavior of the mean - field model described in theorem  [ th : mf ] , if we think of the mean - field model as having  @xmath56  note that @xmath57 implies   holds .    setting  @xmath58 , the process reduces to the multitype contact process completely analyzed when the death rates are equal in  @xcite .",
    "the transition rates become @xmath59 in this case , the type with the larger birth rate outcompetes the other type provided its birth rate is also strictly larger than the critical value of the single - type contact process .",
    "this result has first been proved in  @xcite using duality techniques and again in  @xcite using also a block construction in order to prove that the long - term behavior of the process is not altered by small perturbations of the parameters .",
    "using in addition a coupling argument , it can be easily deduced from  ( * ? ? ? * propositions  3.13.2 ) that , the recovery rate  @xmath12 being fixed , for all  @xmath51 , @xmath60 the parameter region in   is shown in the bottom left diagram of figure  [ fig:3d - diag ] .",
    "although it is not recorded in theorem [ th : mf ] , this behavior also agrees with that of the mean - field model , which can be verified by an examination of the nullclines described in section  [ sec : mf ]  here the assumption that  @xmath11 is small is important .",
    "the forest fire model , also referred to as epidemics with recovery , is the three - state spin system with a cyclic dynamics described by the following three transitions : @xmath61 the three states are interpreted as  0 = alive , 2 = on fire and 1 = burnt , but can also be thought respectively as healthy , infected and immune in the context of epidemics .",
    "this process has been studied in  @xcite which proves the existence of a critical value  @xmath62 such that , in  @xmath63 , @xmath64 because the dynamics is cyclic , basic couplings between the forest fire model and our process do not lead to any useful stochastic ordering between the two systems .",
    "however , the proof in  @xcite easily extends to our process in a certain parameter region . indeed ,",
    "in addition to general geometrical properties and percolation results which are not related to the specific dynamics of the forest fire model , the key estimates in  @xcite rely on the following two ingredients :    * the set of burning trees dominates its counterpart in the process with no regrowth ( @xmath65 ) provided both processes start from the same configuration . * in regions that have not been on fire for at least  @xmath66 units of time , the set of trees which are alive dominates a product measure with density  @xmath67 .",
    "now , fix  @xmath68 , let  @xmath69 and consider the spin system on the two - dimensional integer lattice whose dynamics is described by the five transitions @xmath70 in this process , trees burn for an exponential amount of time with rate  @xmath71 as in the original forest fire model .",
    "it follows that the domination property  ( a ) remains true : the set of burning trees in this new process dominates its counterpart in the forest fire model with no regrowth and in which the fire spreads by contact at rate  @xmath72 . since the transition  @xmath50 again occurs spontaneously at rate  @xmath73 , the domination of the product measure  ( b ) remains true as well .",
    "in particular , @xmath74 this holds for all  @xmath75 . since the proof in  @xcite",
    "is based on a block construction , which supports small perturbations of the system , we also obtain coexistence in the process   under the same assumptions and provided  @xmath8 is sufficiently small . in conclusion , in  @xmath63 , @xmath76 the parameter region in   is shown in the two diagrams on the right of figure  [ fig:3d - diag ] .",
    "we now focus on the parameter region where  @xmath77 which is not covered by our previous results . in this case",
    ", the host population survives without the symbiont , which is a pathogen , and the main question is whether associated and unassociated hosts coexist .",
    "theorem [ th : mf ] says that in the mean - field model they do coexist , provided @xmath11 is large enough .",
    "interestingly , our results show that for the stochastic process , the answer depends on the spatial dimension .    to begin with , we show that , even when infected hosts are sterile , coexistence is possible in spatial dimensions  @xmath0 but we also point out that our proof relies on geometric arguments that do not hold in one dimension . more precisely , we have the following theorem .    ",
    "[ th:2d ] assume that @xmath34 and  @xmath0 .",
    "then , there is  @xmath78 large such that @xmath79    note that , when  @xmath80 , the result directly follows from   so the theorem is only interesting when infected hosts have a low birth rate .",
    "the proof relies on a block construction , a technique introduced in  @xcite .",
    "having a tiling of the lattice into large squares and letting  @xmath81 and  @xmath82 be two adjacent squares , the main ingredient is to prove that , whenever  @xmath81 contains a large number of pathogens while  @xmath82 does not have too many pathogens ,    * there is a large connected component void of pathogens included in  @xmath82 and * the number of pathogens on the boundary of this connected component is large .",
    "this is used together with the fact that  @xmath34 to show that , in a short time , one of the infected hosts along the boundary recovers .",
    "this recovery event is followed with probability close to one by a wave of births and then a wave of infections which , together , ensure that a positive fraction of the square  @xmath82 becomes infected .",
    "large deviations estimates are used to make this precise .",
    "in contrast with theorem  [ th:2d ] , when  @xmath24 and  @xmath83 , and even when the infection rate and the birth rate of healthy hosts are very large , the pathogen is unable to survive .    ",
    "[ th:1d ] assume that  @xmath77 and  @xmath24 and  @xmath83 .",
    "then , starting from any configuration with infinitely many vertices in state  1 , @xmath84    the two parameter regions covered by theorems  [ th:2d ] and  [ th:1d ] are illustrated in the last three phase diagrams of figure  [ fig:3d - diag ] .",
    "we point out that theorem  [ th:1d ] holds even when  @xmath85 , i.e. , when the pathogen invades instantaneously nearby healthy hosts . also , in addition to the statement of the theorem , our proof gives specific estimates on the rate of extinction of the pathogens and the rate of expansion of the healthy hosts .",
    "the first part of the proof shows that there exists a constant  @xmath86 such that , uniformly in all configurations  @xmath87 with infinitely many  1s and for any site  @xmath5 , @xmath88 where  @xmath89 refers to the law of the process starting from configuration  @xmath87 . in other words , there exists a uniform ( over all sites ) exponentially growing ( in time ) neighborhood of any site which is eventually void of pathogens . to describe the long - term behavior of the healthy hosts ,",
    "let  @xmath90 denote the one - dimensional nearest - neighbor ( supercritical ) contact process with parameter  @xmath8 starting from the all - one configuration .",
    "also , let  @xmath91 denote the edge speed in this contact process as defined in  @xcite .",
    "then , under the assumptions of the theorem , there exist    * a random site  @xmath92 and an almost surely finite time  @xmath93 that depend on  @xmath87 , * site - valued processes  @xmath94 defined for @xmath95 and satisfying  @xmath96 , * a coupling of the processes  @xmath97 and  @xmath90    such that , @xmath89-almost surely , @xmath98 \\times [ t , \\infty ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ] in other words , as long as  @xmath87 has an infinite number of  1s then , @xmath89-almost surely , eventually there arises a stable population of  1s that behaves like the basic contact process on an interval that grows linearly in time . from   , we also obtain a complete convergence theorem . indeed ,",
