    "one of the most prominent areas of research in mathematical physics in the last 30 years has been that of supersymmetry ( susy ) , based on the work of witten in particle physics.@xcite in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) , the work of mielnik@xcite has been the basis for the development of isospectral potentials for different quantum problems,@xcite and also for higher supersymmetric developments.@xcite    the best example to introduce susy qm is that of the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) , whose hamiltonian @xmath0 possess the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues given by @xmath1 where h@xmath2 are the hermite polynomials , satisfying hermite s equation @xmath3 hermite s equation can be derived from the sho schrdinger s equation by acting the hamiltonian ( [ sho ] ) on the functions ( [ eigen ] ) and leaving the equation for the functions h@xmath2 alone .",
    "one can find in the literature generalizations of eq.([hermit ] ) , which define generalized hermite polynomials h@xmath4,@xcite h@xmath5,@xcite and h@xmath6,@xcite or simply define the hermite functions as @xmath7=h@xmath8 , the quantum eigenfunctions .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ sho ] ) can be factorized using the anhilitation and creation operators @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "mielnik proposed a different way to factorize the hamiltonian , by introducing new operators@xcite @xmath12 which , in order to satisfy the factorization @xmath13 , lead to a riccati equation for the function @xmath14 @xmath15 the immediate solution @xmath16 leads to the original anihilation / creation operators , while the general solution of the riccati equation @xmath17 leads to new hamiltonians ( and potentials ) defined by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , \\label{newpot}\\ ] ] isospectral to the sho potential , whose eigenfunctions are defined by @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and with the ground state defined by the equation @xmath22 the new potentials and eigenfunctions depend on the susy parameter @xmath23 .    in this article",
    "we would like to show that not all has been said about factorizing the hamiltonian ( [ sho ] ) , and that we can still find some hidden information through the factorization procedure .",
    "we shall propose an alternative factorization , which includes both mielnik s factorization and the original factorization , in terms of anihilation / creation operators , as particular cases , and which in its most general form would lead to a bi - parametric factorization of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , we shall only concentrate on a simple form of this factorization that leads to a new general equation for the sho which includes its schrdinger s equation and hermite s equation as particular cases .",
    "to begin with , let us introduce the couple of non - mutually adjoint operators @xmath24 and let us require again that they factorize the hamiltonian as @xmath25 . then ,",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 have to satisfy the coupled equations @xmath28 these equations can be uncoupled by dividing the second one by @xmath26 , multiplying the first one by @xmath29 , and substracting , to obtain @xmath30 clearly , mielnik s solution ( [ betagen ] ) is the general solution for this equation , introducing one parameter , @xmath31 . a second parameter , @xmath32 , will appear when we insert this solution into one of the equations ( [ coup - a ] ) or ( [ coup - b ] ) to find the complete biparametric solution . when these parameters acquire the values that make @xmath33 we shall recover mielnik s factorization of the simple harmonic oscillator , just as when @xmath34 in mielnik s factorization we recover the original factorization ( [ a*a ] ) .    using mielnik s solution ( [ betagen ] )",
    "it is easy to calculate the general solution to eqs.([coup - a],[coup - b ] ) , and to find the operators that factorize the sho hamiltonian in terms of the product @xmath35 .",
    "then , we may consider carrying out the inverse product @xmath36 to see where we are led to .",
    "obviously , we shall not obtain a newer hamiltonian , due to the factors @xmath37 and @xmath26 in ( [ newb*b ] ) , which may be the reason why this factorization was not paid attention to in the past .",
    "what s more , it is obvious that this operator product will be lengthy and most easily wo nt give any new insight to the problem .",
    "therefore , we shall consider here only the most simple solution to eqs.([coup - a],[coup - b ] ) to show that it leads to a new general equation for the sho , lost in the trends of the susy factorization scheme .",
    "let us now take the simplest solution to eq.([ricc - ba ] ) , @xmath38 . introducing this solution into eq.([coup - a ] )",
    ", we get a bernoulli equation for @xmath39 @xmath40 this equation is easily integrated , giving @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath41 to avoid singularities , we simply require that @xmath42 .    as we said before",
    ", the inverse operator product @xmath36 will not give us a new hamiltonian .",
    "however , we can still introduce a second order operator defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{ltilde}\\ ] ] also , defining the functions h@xmath45 by @xmath46 we have that @xmath47 now , as in susy qm , we can define the missing function h@xmath48 by requiring that @xmath49 , leading to the equation @xmath50 whose solution is @xmath51 in fact , since @xmath52 , eqs.([a*a ] ) and ( [ newb*b ] ) tell us that @xmath53 , and hence all ( unnormalized ) functions @xmath54 become @xmath55 , @xmath21 .",
    "owing to the sturm - liouville theory,@xcite the functions @xmath54 are found to be orthogonal , since multiplying eq.([unp1l ] ) by the factor @xmath56 we get the eigenvalue equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 \\label{ll}\\ ] ] is a new self - adjoint operator for the sho , whose normalized eigenfunctions are @xmath59 and where @xmath60 is the appropriate weight function .",
    "note that the eigenfunctions ( [ unfin ] ) are not just the product of the hermite polynomials and _ any _ other function , but a direct consequence of the factorization based on the operators @xmath61 ( [ newb*b ] ) .    the operator @xmath62 , the weight factor @xmath63 and the eigenfunctions @xmath64 , all depend on the factorization parameter @xmath32 . in the case @xmath65 , we have that @xmath66 , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 become the original anihilation / creation operators ( [ a*a ] ) .",
    "also , the eigenvalue equation ( [ unsl ] ) becomes schrdinger s equation for the sho , and @xmath64 become the quantum eigenfunctions .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit @xmath69 , @xmath62 , @xmath70 , and @xmath54 become @xmath71 and the eigenvalue equation ( [ unsl ] ) becomes hermite s differential equation .",
    "therefore , we can call eq.([unsl ] ) a new _ generalized hermite equation _ for the sho , which includes schrdinger s and hermite s equations as particular cases for limiting values of the parameter @xmath32 , linked by a continuos parametric transformation from one to the other .",
    "this also allows us to call the eigenfunctions h@xmath45 new _",
    "generalized hermite functions_.    a plot of the first generalized hermite functions is shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "notice the change in the functions behaviour as @xmath32 goes from zero to infinity , showing the continuos passage from the quantum mechanics eigenfunctions to the hermite polynomials .",
    "the corresponding raising and lowering operators , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , are easily deduced from the action of @xmath74 and @xmath75 over @xmath76 .",
    "the non - mutually adjoint operators @xmath77 @xmath78 become the creation / anihilation operators of the quantum mechanics problem as @xmath79 , and the raising and lowering operators for the hermite polynomials as @xmath69 .",
    "they satisfy the relations @xmath80 which are the quantum eigenfunctions creation / anihilation operations when @xmath81 , and become the raising / lowering operations for the hermite polynomials in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "they also satisfy that @xmath83 and , therefore , @xmath84=1 \\ , .",
    "\\label{cc*comm}\\ ] ] finally , due to the relation @xmath85 and eq.([unp1l ] ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to the creation / anihilation operators introduced by mielnik@xcite as triple operator products .",
    "in this article we have introduced an alternative factorization for the sho hamiltonian that leads to the new self adjoint equation ( [ unsl ] ) , a parametric equation that becomes the sho schrdinger s equation in the limit @xmath79 , and hermite s equation in the limit @xmath86 .",
    "we therefore call this equation the new _ generalized hermite equation _ and the functions h@xmath45 ( [ unfin ] ) the new _ generalized hermite functions_. we have also shown that the raising and lowering operators ( [ creaani]-[creaani2 ] ) correspond to the appropriate operators in these limits .",
