    "despite splendid successes of the standard model of particle physics , some fundamental questions remained unanswered , among which the origin of fermion masses is one of the most important problems . in the standard model ,",
    "these masses are taken as free parameters , and can only be extracted from experimental data .",
    "phenomenological analysis aiming at discovering the numerical relations between fermion masses is useful and practical for the exploration of the mystery of lepton and quark masses .",
    "there have been some conjectures on this problem ( for example ,",
    "@xcite ) , in which koide s relation  @xcite is the most accurate one , which links the masses of charged leptons together , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the masses of electron , muon , and tau , respectively . in order to see the accuracy of koide s relation ,",
    "we can introduce a parameter @xmath10 , @xmath11 with the data of pdg  @xcite , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we can get the range of @xmath10 , @xmath15 , which is perfectly close to 1 .",
    "this relation was speculated on the basis of a composite model of quarks and leptons  @xcite and the extended technicolor - like model  @xcite .",
    "the fermion mass matrix in these models is taken as @xmath16 where @xmath17 . with the assumptions @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix is @xmath21 unit matrix , koide obtained this relation .",
    "this relation is deduced in several other different models by koide also  @xcite .",
    "( for a review , see  @xcite . ) several explanations for this excellent relation were presented in the past ten years .",
    "foot  @xcite gave a geometrical interpretation to it , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angle between the points @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "commonly , we can extend @xmath25 to a more general mass square root vector @xmath26 , however , the value of @xmath27 does not affect explicitly the value of @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , we can find the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath23 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "besides the miraculous success of koide s relation for charged leptons , two further questions emerge naturally ,    ( 1 ) . whether this relation can be applied to quarks and neutrinos ,    ( 2 ) .",
    "whether this relation holds well at different energy scales .",
    "the first question has been discussed by esposito and santorelli  @xcite , rivero and gsponer  @xcite , and us  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we applied koide s relation to quarks and neutrinos , and estimated the masses of neutrinos . for the second question , due to the renormalization effect , the masses of quarks and leptons vary with the energy scale of interaction , so we must examine koide s relation at different energy scales explicitly , before one can take the extension of the relation to quarks and neutrinos seriously .    in section",
    "ii , we check the application of koide s relation to quarks and charged leptons . by using the previously introduced parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 to characterize the deviations of @xmath30-type and @xmath31-type quarks from koide s relation  @xcite , we find that @xmath2 and @xmath3 keep almost invariant in a very wide energy range .",
    "this means that koide s relation is a universal result which is independent ( or insensitive ) of the running masses of quarks and leptons . in section iii , we apply koide s relation to neutrinos , with both the normal and inverted mass schemes considered . furthermore , with some analogies and conjectures between quarks and leptons , the neutrino masses are predicted . finally , in section iv",
    ", we give some discussions to koide s relation .",
    "in order to see whether koide s relation holds well at different energy scales , we must get the values of quark and lepton masses first .",
    "because of the renormalization effect , the scale dependence of the running quark masses is determined by  @xcite @xmath32 and @xmath33.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is an energy scale , @xmath35 is the effective number of quark flavors  @xcite , and @xmath36 is the effective qcd coupling constant , which is also a @xmath34-dependent function , @xmath37 \\right\\}+o\\left(\\frac{\\ln^2 l}{l^3}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the coefficients of the renormalization group equation @xmath42 and @xmath43    using eq .",
    "( [ eq.mass ] ) , the numerical results of the running masses of quarks were obtained by fusaoka and koide  @xcite , as summarized in table  1 , in which both low and high energy scales are calculated .",
    "first , for the energy scales lower than the spontaneous symmetry breaking energy scale @xmath44 of the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath45 , seven different energy scales are taken into account , i.e. , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mass of w and z bosons .",
    "second , for the energy scales extremely higher than @xmath44 , the evolution of the yukawa coupling constants must be considered . in  @xcite ,",
    "two different models are presented .",
    "one is the standard model , and the other is the minimal susy model . in both of these two models , the hamiltonian of the fermion fields can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the yukawa coupling constants , and @xmath59 are the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the higgs bosons @xmath60 . in the standard model , @xmath61 , and in the minimal susy model which has two higgs bosons , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the mass matrices at the energy scale @xmath52 of quarks are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the vacuum expectation values of @xmath59 , and @xmath66 .",
    "in the standard model , @xmath67 , and in the minimal susy model , @xmath68 .",
    ".the masses of quarks at different energy scales .",
    "the upper seven rows in table  i are the cases of lower energy scales , the 8th and 9th rows are the cases of higher energy scales in the standard model , and the last two rows are the cases of higher energy scales in the minimal susy model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the same time , we can see in table  iv that @xmath10 at high energy scales is still quite close to 1 as at the low energy scale , which means that koide s relation is suitable for charged leptons at all the energy scales , just as quarks .",
    "also , we can find in table  iv that @xmath10 in the minimal susy model is a little larger than that in the standard model .    in summary",
    ", we can conclude that koide s relation is a result independent ( or insensitive ) of energy scales of interaction , from low to extremely high energies .",
    "after testing koide s relation for quarks and charged leptons , and finding that @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath10 are independent of energy scales , a natural question is what about this relation for neutrinos . here",
    "we again introduce the parameter @xmath4 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss this problem .",
    "moreover , we try to find the relations between the four parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 , and finally we can get the neutrino masses with some conjectures .",
    "it is quite difficult to verify whether koide s relation is suitable for neutrinos because of the long - existed inaccuracy of the experimental data of neutrinos . due to the untiring efforts by the numerous neutrino experiments ,",
    "the oscillations and mixings of neutrinos have been strongly established now .",
    "the solar neutrino deficit is caused by the oscillation from @xmath69 to a mixture of @xmath70 and @xmath71 with a mixing angle approximately of @xmath72 in the kamland  @xcite and sno  @xcite experiments .",
    "also , the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is due to the @xmath70 to @xmath71 oscillation with almost the largest mixing angle of @xmath73 in the k2k  @xcite and super - kamiokande  @xcite experiments .",
    "however , the non - observation of the disappearance of @xmath74 in the chooz  @xcite experiment showed that the mixing angle @xmath75 is smaller than @xmath76 at the best fit point  @xcite .",
    "these experiments also measured the mass - squared differences of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "according to the global analysis of the experimental results , we have ( the allowed ranges at @xmath77 )  @xcite @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 are the masses of the three mass eigenstates of neutrinos , and the best fit points are @xmath83 , and @xmath84 @xcite .    due to mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein  @xcite matter effect of solar neutrinos",
    ", we already know that @xmath85 .",
    "hence we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 so there are two mass schemes , ( 1 ) the normal mass scheme @xmath88 , and ( 2 ) the inverted mass scheme @xmath89 .",
    "we will discuss both of them in the following .",
    "now we apply koide s relation to neutrinos .",
    "first we take the normal mass scheme for example . if koide s relation holds well for neutrinos , we have @xmath90 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq.5 ] ) and  ( [ eq.6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq.nu ] ) , we get @xmath91{m^2_2-\\delta m_{\\mathrm{sol}}^{2}}+\\sqrt{m_2}+\\sqrt[4]{m^2_2+\\delta m_{\\mathrm{atm}}^{2}}\\right)^2.\\ ] ]    solving this equation , we find that there is no real root for @xmath81 with the restrictions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) and  ( [ eq.4 ] ) .",
    "this means that no matter what value @xmath81 is , koide s relation does not hold for neutrinos .",
    "so is the inverted mass scheme .",
    "thus we must introduce a parameter @xmath4  @xcite to character the deviation of neutrinos from koide s relation , @xmath92    since @xmath93 , we must determine its range , and this can help us to find the relations between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 , and fix the neutrino masses .",
    "we now check the situations for the two mass schemes , respectively .    \\1 . for the normal mass scheme , @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath94{m^2_2-\\delta m_{\\mathrm{sol}}^{2}}+\\sqrt{m_2}+\\sqrt[4]{m^2_2+\\delta m_{\\mathrm{atm}}^{2}}\\right)^2}.\\label{eq.10}\\ ] ] we can see that @xmath4 is the function of @xmath81 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 are fixed .",
    "due to the inaccuracy of the experimental data , we take @xmath95 and @xmath96 as their best fit values here .",
    "the range of @xmath4 is shown in fig .  1",
    ".    we can see from fig .  1 that @xmath97 , and @xmath4 decreases with the increase of @xmath81 .",
    "so @xmath98 for neutrinos .",
    "\\2 . for the inverted mass scheme , @xmath89",
    ", we have @xmath99{m^2_2-\\delta m_{\\mathrm{sol}}^{2}}+\\sqrt{m_2}+\\sqrt[4]{m^2_2-\\delta m_{\\mathrm{atm}}^{2}}\\right)^2}.\\ ] ] the range of @xmath4 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we can see from fig .  2 that @xmath100 .",
    "again , @xmath98 for neutrinos .    altogether , @xmath97 for both of these two mass schemes . and @xmath4 of the normal mass scheme is larger than that of the inverted mass scheme .",
    "conclusively , the values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 can be summarized as follows , @xmath101    we believe that the problem of the origin of the masses of leptons must be solved together with that of quarks . since @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we may conjecture that @xmath104 . at the same time , since @xmath97 and @xmath105 , we may analogize the conjecture of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and propose the hypothesis that @xmath108 this is from the speculation that there must be some relation between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 . of course , this ansatz is not the unique one of the relations between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "for example , we may also assume that @xmath109 or @xmath110 eq .",
    "( [ eq.1k ] ) is based on the assumption that @xmath111 in foot s geometrical interpretation .",
    "all these hypotheses can show the balance between @xmath4 and @xmath2 intuitively and transparently .",
    "this situation seems to be similar to the quark - lepton complementarity between mixing angles of quarks and leptons  @xcite , and we may call it a quark - lepton complementarity of masses .    from table  ii , we can see that the value of @xmath112 is approximately 1.33 .",
    "thus from the hypothesis @xmath113 , we get that @xmath114 .",
    "this is consistent with the normal mass scheme and in conflict with the inverted mass scheme .",
    "this indicates that the three masses of neutrino mass eigenstates are heavier in order , which is the same as quarks and charged leptons .",
    "now we can estimate the absolute masses of neutrinos .",
    "substituting @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 into eq .",
    "( [ eq.10 ] ) , we obtain the value of @xmath81 , @xmath118{m^2_2 - 6.9\\times 10^{-5}~\\mbox{ev}^{2}}+\\sqrt{m_2}+\\sqrt[4]{m^2_2 + 2.6\\times 10^{-3}~\\mbox{ev}^{2}}\\right)^2},\\label{eq.18}\\ ] ] and we get @xmath119 .",
    "straightforwardly , we get @xmath120 and @xmath121    now we discuss the uncertainty of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in fig .  1",
    ", we can see that the slope of the curve in very large where @xmath122 , so the value of @xmath81 is not very sensitive to the error of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath81 will approximately be @xmath123 even if the value of @xmath4 charges from 0.65 to 0.8 , so the value of @xmath81 is precise to a fairly good degree of accuracy .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath82 will be about @xmath124 to a good degree of accuracy too , because @xmath125 , and @xmath126 . the only point desired to be mentioned here",
    "is the range of @xmath80 .",
    "because if @xmath127 is rather closed to @xmath128 , and due to the big uncertainty of @xmath128 , the value of @xmath80 may change largely with @xmath4 .",
    "we can see this in the other two hypotheses in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.kk ] ) and ( [ eq.1k ] ) .",
    "\\1 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq.kk ] ) , where @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 , and @xmath131    \\2 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1k ] ) , where @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 , and @xmath134    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq.19 ] ) , ( [ eq.kkm ] ) and ( [ eq.1 km ] ) , we can see that the value @xmath80 is only a rough estimate of the first step till now , and its effective number and order of magnitude may change with the more and more precise experimental data in the future . however , the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are consistent in these three hypotheses .    finally , we should point out that koide  @xcite also gave an interpretation of his relation as a mixing between octet and singlet components in a nonet scheme of the flavor @xmath135 , and got the neutrino masses as @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138  @xcite .",
    "we can see that his results are strongly consistent with ours , especially with the results from eq .",
    "( [ eq.kuknu ] ) . and recently , he got the three masses as @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 in a seesaw mass matrix model of quarks and leptons with flavor - triplet higgs scalars  @xcite , which is even closer to our results from eq .",
    "( [ eq.kuknu ] ) .",
    "finally , we give some discussions .    \\1 .",
    "since koide s relation is such a wonderful result for charged leptons at low energy scale , to explore its behavior at high energy is straightforward .",
    "we carefully test whether it is energy scale independent in section ii , and find that it is really independent or insensitive of energy scale in a huge energy range and is almost the same in both the standard model and the minimal susy model , which proves that koide s relation is a universal result in particle physics .          from eq .",
    "( [ eq.seesaw ] ) , we can get @xmath146 where the neutrino mass eigenvalues are @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the smallness of neutrino masses is due to the large values of @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "( for example , @xmath153 if @xmath145 is taken as @xmath154 . )    however , seesaw mechanism can only present an illustrative interpretation of the origin of neutrino masses , without accurate prediction of the masses of neutrino mass eigenstates . to obtain those ,",
    "we must extend our theory and make some speculation , i.e. , we examine whether koide s relation of charged leptons also holds well for neutrinos , and we find that not all quarks and leptons obey koide s relation precisely .",
    "so we introduce the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 to describe the deviations of quarks and neutrinos from the exact koide s relation . with this improved relation and the conjecture of a quark - lepton complementarity of masses such as @xmath155 , @xmath156 or @xmath132 , we can determine the absolute masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "due to the inaccuracy of the experimental data of neutrinos nowadays , these results ( especially the value of @xmath80 ) should be only taken as primary estimates .",
    "it is also possible that seesaw mechanism is responsible for the deviation of the neutrino masses from the exact koide s relation .",
    "which hypothesis between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 is really the relation between them ?",
    "for example , if @xmath157 , we have @xmath158 in foot s geometrical interpretation , is there really some deeper reason behind it , just like the quark - lepton complementarity of their mixing angles  @xcite ?    ( 2 ) .",
    "we can see from table  ii that @xmath2 is approximately 1.33 , so may it be @xmath159 exactly ?",
    "if so , we have @xmath160 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.kuknu ] ) , @xmath161 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.kk ] ) , and @xmath162 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1k ] ) .",
    "all these @xmath2 and @xmath4 are of special values , and is there some unknown principle leading this ? moreover ,",
    "is @xmath163 exactly as @xmath10 , or deviates from 1 slightly ?",
    "if so , why ?    in conclusion , we believe that there must be some deeper principle behind the elegant koide s relation for charged leptons , and thus it is meaningful to check whether this relation is also applicable to quarks and neutrinos , at least at some degree .",
    "we show in this paper that the koide s relation with its deviation characterized by the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 is also applicable to quarks without sensitivity to energy scale . by using the improved koide s relation with an ansatz of quark - lepton complementarity of masses",
    ", we can also determine neutrino masses .",
    "if the prediction of neutrino masses is tested to be consistent with the precise experiments in the future , it would be a big success of koide s relation , which may shed light on our way to a grand unification theory of quarks and leptons .",
