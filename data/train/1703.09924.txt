    "target tracking , in particular submarine target tracking , which role is to determine the position and velocity of the target has been extensively studied in the past decade @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , there is little work @xcite that focuses on computation of optimal trajectories of underwater vehicle based on signal attenuation due to acoustic propagation and taking into account the uncertainties on the target position and velocity .",
    "the original aspect of our approach is to propose a mathematical computational model to address this problem .    in a context of passive underwater acoustic warfare , we are interested in optimizing the trajectory of a submarine called _ carrier_. the carrier is equipped with passive sonars .",
    "a question naturally arises : how should the carrier position itself to detect at best the acoustic signal issued by other vehicles called _ targets _ ?",
    "conversely , given that the targets are also equipped with sonars , how should the carrier position itself to keep its own detection range as low as possible with respect to those targets ?",
    "these two objectives being seemingly contradictory , is it possible to take into account both of them simultaneously ?",
    "a smart operator , if provided information about a single target position and velocity and a sound propagation code can find a good trajectory for either one of these single objectives . if the two criterions are considered simultaneously , or if several targets have to be taken into account , it is hardly possible for a human operator to find the best route .",
    "some decision making tools have to be developed to this aim .",
    "one of the candidates are markov decision processes ( mdps ) which are widely used in many fields such as engineering , computer science , operation research .",
    "they constitute a general family of controlled stochastic processes suitable for modeling sequential decision - making problems under uncertainty .",
    "a significant list of references on discrete - time mdps may be found in the survey @xcite and the books @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to use this framework to compute optimal trajectories for underwater vehicles evolving in a given environment to meet some objectives such as mentioned above . in our preliminary works",
    "@xcite and @xcite we have applied this method to control a carrier whose mission was to detect one or several targets as well as possible . in @xcite one important assumption was that the positions of the targets followed a random model but were perfectly observed at the decision dates .",
    "this assumption is unrealistic as the targets positions are usually only known up to some random error through sonar measurements .",
    "the assumption is abandoned in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we propose a control strategy for a carrier submarine in a context of bearings - only tracking ( bot ) .",
    "it is well known that many real - world problems modeled by mdps have finite but huge state and/or action spaces , leading to the well - known curse of dimensionality , which makes the solution of the resulting models numerically intractable .",
    "our initial optimization procedure includes an optimized dynamic discretization of the space of the targets positions at each time step from the current time to the computation horizon . adding uncertainty on the targets",
    "makes the space of the targets positions significantly larger .",
    "more points are thus required in the discretization grids to keep a satisfying accuracy , dramatically slowing down the global process : construction and optimization of the discretized grids , final trajectory optimization procedure .",
    "simulation - based algorithms such as multi - stage adaptive sampling , evolutionary policy method and model reference adaptive search @xcite can be used to overcome this difficulty .",
    "but in the context of bot , these approaches can not be applied , since a filtering procedure has to be integrated . under the consideration of practice",
    ", we choose to split the long - term horizon into a sequence of sub - intervals , making the global optimization sub - optimal but real - time achievable , as the discretization grids only need to be optimized on a shorter horizon .",
    "related works in the literature are for example model predictive control @xcite , moving horizon control @xcite or receding horizon approach @xcite , where similar ideas of shortened horizon are used to make the problems numerically solvable in real - time . within the pomdp ( partially observable markov decision processes @xcite ) framework ,",
    "the most computationally tractable strategy is to use myopic open - loop feedback control . in @xcite ,",
    "a sequence of shortened horizon h is fixed and monte carlo integration method is used to estimate reward fonction for each horizon .",
    "our focus is on computational approaches to find optimal policies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect_statement ] states the problem in a general context and explains our strategy to solve it .",
    "section [ sect_controle_stoch ] briefly outlines the dynamic programming algorithms used .",
    "section [ sect_numerical_results ] presents the numerical results for four different scenarios , from the simplest case to the realistic case .",
    "underwater sound propagation in the sea depends on many environmental parameters such as temperature , salinity , etc .",
    "indeed , small variations of these parameters may greatly modify the sound propagation ( see for instance @xcite ) . to illustrate this phenomena , fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] gives an example of a sound propagation diagram with an emitter source standing at a @xmath0 depth ( top left ) .",
    "the signal loss level due to propagation usually takes values in @xmath1\\,db$ ] .",
    "the emitter may well be detected by a carrier in the areas ( distance to emitter versus depth of carrier ) of lower signal loss level ( @xmath2 , represented by dark red color ) , and a contrario is hardly detectable if not undetectable in higher signal loss level areas ( @xmath3 , represented by dark blue color ) .",
    "please also note that the carrier being close to the emitter does not guarantee a good detection . in this figure ,",
    "the signal loss level is saturated to @xmath4 .",
    "[ t ]        let us consider a general situation with a carrier submarine of interest @xmath5 surrounded by one or several targets .",
    "this submarine carries passive sensors so that the available measurements are the estimated angles ( bearings ) from observer to sources . the trajectory of submarine @xmath5 has to be controlled in order to satisfy some given mission objectives .",
    "these can be e.g. optimizing the different targets detection range , minimizing its own detection range as perceived by the other targets , reaching a way - point with minimum fuel consumption , etc .",
    "the following inputs are supposed to be available    1 .",
    "@xmath5 perfect position and velocity , 2 .",
    "noisy observation of the target , namely bearing and frequency , 3 .",
    "information about the environment ( sound speed , sea floor depth , bottom type , ... ) .    a sound propagation code which calculates the signal loss level due to propagation ( such as in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) is also available .",
    "the desired output is an optimized sequence of commands to pilot the carrier submarine in order fulfill its mission at best within a given time interval , see fig [ fig_2 ] .    concerning the targets ,",
    "their evolution is described by a stochastic model .",
    "as seen in section [ sect_statement ] the problem is quite complex , there are uncertain inputs and a probabilistic modeling should be used to take account of this feature .",
    "a discrete stochastic optimal control framework seems to be a good candidate to solve this problem .",
    "more precisely , we use a discrete - time finite horizon dynamic programming approach .",
    "we first describe this approach for a single long - term optimization problem , then we will explain how to divide it into a sequence of short - term ones .",
    "we have opted for the quantization technique to discretize the movement of the targets .",
    "as the targets evolve in an infinite continuous space , quantization offers both a discretized density and a transition matrix , required for mdp approach and allows for discretization grids that are dynamic and concentrated at the most probable positions of the targets .",
    "the aim is to compute an optimal trajectory by applying a command @xmath6 to @xmath5 s future states for all times @xmath7 up to the computation horizon , see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .    in our framework ,",
    "three probabilistic techniques are used , namely kalman filter , quantization and dynamic programming , and each of these overlaps with one another and are combined in an iterative algorithm .",
    "[ t ]          in this section , we briefly introduce the discrete - time finite horizon markov control framework .",

    "the optimization criteria @xmath29 can be either @xmath30 ( to minimize a loss ) or @xmath31 ( to maximize a performance ) according to the mission s type .",
    "the main idea of the dynamic programming principle is to recursively solve a sequence of one - step optimization problems by computing ( backwards ) a sequence of functions @xmath32 by the following algorithm    * @xmath33 , * for @xmath34 and @xmath13 @xmath35.\\ ] ]    the last function thus constructed , @xmath36 , is the value function @xmath37 .",

    "the parameters @xmath59 are given a priori standard values .",
    "thus the natural state space for the target is continuous .",
    "however , to apply the dynamic programming approach described in part  [ sec : dp ] , we need a finite state space . hence , it is necessary to approximate the continuous state space with a finite one .",

    "the quantization algorithm is based on monte carlo simulations combined with a stochastic gradient method .",
    "it provides @xmath62 grids , one for each @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , with a fixed finite number of points in each grid .",

    "a special technique of quantization is proposed for the multi - target scenario .",
    "the third and fourth scenarios are more realistic , we will split the time horizon into subintervals to make the computation feasible .",
    "we consider here the simplest scenario : there is a single target in the environment .",
    "the carrier wants to best detect the target .",
    "the initial geometry is depicted by fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "the target ( red ) follows a uniform motion and its depth remains constant ( 500 m ) . at initial time",
    "the depth of the carrier submarine is 300 m. the relative target - carrier speed is 10 @xmath107 .    in this scenario",
    "we assume that the position of target @xmath63 is known at the decision time , and at each time step , available controls are in one dimension ( @xmath108 ) , which means that the only control action is change of depth .",
    "results are illustrated in fig [ fig_4 ] .",
    "the diagram represents the sound propagation loss of target , and the trajectory of carrier is plotted by white dot points .",
    "we can see that the movement of carrier is `` intelligent '' in the sense that its position is always in the red aera , where the sound acoustic loss of target is lower .",
    "let us consider a more complex scenario with two targets at different depth .",
    "the first target is at 500 m depth whereas the second target has a depth of 100 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the available controls are also in one dimension .    in the case of multi - target , there are two ways to quantify the movement of targets .",
    "the first ways is to quantify each target separately and independently , because the evolution of the targets is assumed to be independent .",
    "the second method is to regroup the targets in one state space by increasing the dimension of state space . for this scenario",

    "the coefficients @xmath128 and @xmath129 can be modified if we privilege the detection one of two targets .",
    "[ fig_6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] illustrate the sound propagation loss diagram of targets 1 et 2 respectively , and the trajectory of carrier is plotted by white dot points .",
    "we can see that the movement of carrier is also `` intelligent '' in the sense that for most of the time , it is positioned in `` good '' area , where the acoustic loss is lower for both targets .",
    "but during certain periods , it is physically impossible to stay simultaneously in red areas for both targets .",
    "for instance in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] when the distance with target is at 20 km , it is impossible to maintain the carrier in the reddish area of the two targets .",
    "however note that the carrier never reaches the blue area of both targets simultaneously .      in the last two scenarios we consider that the position and velocity of target are unknown .",
    "this assumption is more realistic because the targets positions are usually only known up to some random error through sonar measurements . in this article",
    "we propose a control strategy for a carrier submarine in a context of bearings - only tracking ( bot ) .",
    "it is well known that when the target and carrier are under uniform rectilinear motion , the filter of bot does not converge because the problem is not obervable , some maneuvers have to be performed by the carrier in order to get a precise enough approximation .",
    "therefore we divide our operations into two periods . in the first period",
    "there is no control , only the target motion analysis ( tma ) filter algorithm is run .",
    "in the second period both filter and control algorithms are run , the latter being fed by the former .    in scenario 1 and 2 ,",
    "a long optimization time horizon is performed .",
    "unfortunately , these pre - computations are strongly dependent on the estimated initial position of the targets .",
    "therefore , there is no hope of being able to run it in real time taking into account the regularly updated outputs from the tma algorithm . in order to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we chose to divide the originally long - term optimization problem into a sequence of short - term ones .",
    "this procedure is of course sub - optimal , but it is compatible with real time applications and it gives fairly good results .      to solve numerically the dynamic programming equations of a finite horizon markov decision process ,",
    "the parameter horizon @xmath106 is decisive from the computation time and memory consumption points of view .",
    "indeed , we need to calculate a priori the optimal control associated with each quantization grid point for each time step .",
    "in addition one needs to build and optimize the quantization grids which get larger as the time horizon increases .    in terms of memory , we need to store the transition matrices of size @xmath130 , where @xmath69 is the number of points in the grids @xmath68 . in terms of complexity of the algorithm ,",
    "the computation time increases geometrically with @xmath106 , because the size of the control space increases geometrically . unlike scenario 1 and 2 where the available controls are in one dimension",
    ", we suppose that the control space is in three dimensions @xmath131 , therefore a long horizon @xmath106 will lead to an unsolvable problem .",
    "in addition , we have to calculate the sound propagation diagram ( i.e. cost function @xmath132 in algorithm [ algo_programmation_dynamique ] ) for each control point .    to make the computations tractable",
    ", we propose a splitting technique : we divide the long - term horizon @xmath106 into @xmath133 subintervals , and we build the short - term quantization grids once for each subinterval and apply the short - term dynamic programming algorithm on each subinterval , in an iterative manner .",
    "although this is sub - optimal compared the original long - term horizon problem , it greatly shortens the computation time and makes it possible to run our procedure on line .    at each time step @xmath7 ,",
    "two calculations are performed successively as follows .",
    "first , the tma process with an unscented kalman filter ( ukf ) is performed to estimate the actual position @xmath134 of the target at time @xmath7 .",
    "then one selects the best action given the carrier and target current positions .",
    "suppose that @xmath135 is beginning time of sub - optimal interval , @xmath136 is end time of subinterval , and the state of the target at time @xmath135 is estimated by a probability distribution @xmath137 , which is the output of the ukf filter at end time of precedent sub - optimal interval .",
    "this distribution is used as initial condition to start quantization .",
    "algorithm [ algo_programmation_dynamique ] is applied to pre - calculate optimal control for every quantization point .",
    "as the position and velocity of the target are unknown , ( only their estimations are available ) , we then search in the cloud of quantization grid points the point that is closest to the filtered position and the optimal control corresponding to this grid point is applied at this time step .",
    "algorithm [ algo2_controle_optimale_en_ligne ] is a amended version of algorithm [ algo_controle_optimale_en_ligne ] .",
    "a consequence of the horizon splitting technique is that the quantization grid is automatically updated at the beginning of every subinterval .",
    "a quantization grid can be considered as an approximation of the conditional density given the observations .",
    "when the ukf filter has converged , the grid points are more concentrated , then accuracy of the mdp calculation increases .    in this scenario",
    "there are one carrier submarine and one single target in the environment .",
    "objective of the carrier submarine is to detect at best the target .",
    "the scenario lasts 45 min .",
    "the target follows a rectilinear motion , and its depth remains constant ( 300 m ) .",
    "its position is represented by the green curve in figs .",
    "[ fig_8 ] , [ fig_9 ] and [ fig_12.pdf ] , and the green curve in figs .  [ fig_10 ] and [ fig_13 ] . at each time step , the sensor of the carrier submarine processes two measurements ( bearing and frequency ) .",
    "though in this case the problem is known to be observable , the performance of the filter is quite poor if no maneuvers are scheduled . in our scenario ,",
    "two maneuvers are planned .",
    "the first maneuver is a right turn at t = 10 min , which lasts 2 minutes , the second is a left turn at t = 20 min , which also lasts 2 minutes .",
    "these maneuvers allow the filter to converge , thereafter the submarine follows a rectilinear motion if no control is applied .",

    "it was modified by the dynamic programming procedure , and the quality of the tma filter is not degraded ; * the target diagram signal loss shows that the dynamic programming has well performed as a controller because , in the second period , the carrier submarine remains in the zone of high detection level ( reddish zone ) , despite the fact that we replaced the true position of the target by its filtered estimation ; * the carrier diagram signal loss is also presented in fig [ fig_10 ] , but it does not reflect the reality of the past trajectory , because the submarine depth was changed after @xmath141 min leading to a change of its diagram . as the diagram is changing over time , we can not represent it on a static figure .",
    "see the web site @xcite for a video version . it can be seen that the carrier submarine @xmath5 can sometimes be easily detected by the target because the carrier submarine sound propagation diagram was not taken into account in this scenario .",
    "we now take fully into account the original mission where two seemingly contradictory objectives are to be achieved .",
    "the first objective is to pilot the sensor so as to detect at best the acoustic signal issued by the target , the second objective is to keep its own detection range as low as possible . in this case , the objective function @xmath142 is a multi criteria aggregation function whose optimization will be a trade - off between the conflicting objectives",
    ". we will take into account the diagrams emitted by the carrier submarine and the target simultaneously in our approach .",
    "compared to scenario 3 , we use the same scenario parameters , the only modification is the cost function @xmath125 used in equation ( [ equ_belleman ] ) . instead of using a weighted sum as in the problem of multi - target ( [ equat_fonct_cout_two_targets ] ) , we apply the following method .",
    "let @xmath49 be the position of the carrier submarine , @xmath143 that of the target , @xmath144 ( resp .",
    "@xmath145 , the value extracted from the sound propagation diagrams emitted by the target ( resp . by the carrier submarine ) .",
    "these values vary in the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the objective of the mission is to place the submarine in the area where the value of @xmath144 is as low as possible and the value of @xmath146 as high as possible .",
    "then the cost function associated to @xmath147 is defined by @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the following function @xmath150,\\\\ \\varepsilon & ~\\mbox{if}~ x \\geq 200 , \\end{array }   \\right .\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath151 are chosen to satisfy the continuity conditions : @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "[ fig_11 ] illustrates the function .",
    "the optimization problem is a minimization of the cost function .",
    "the range of @xmath154 varies in interval @xmath155 $ ] . when it is in the area where @xmath156 the multiplier is 1 , penalizing this area ; when @xmath157 the multiplier is @xmath158 making this area of lower cost . in between , @xmath159 is a linear function .",
    "thus we penalize the area where @xmath146 is near 80 without excluding them completely .",
    "the numerical result are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_12.pdf ] and [ fig_13 ] .",
    "the trajectory of the carrier submarine is different from that of figs .",
    "[ fig_9 ] and [ fig_10 ] , because the cost function and the control policy are different .",
    "[ fig_13 ] shows the target and carrier signal loss diagrams respectively .",
    "note that the detection of the target by the carrier submarine is of lower quality than before , in the sense that the carrier submarine is not always in the area of darkest red color .",
    "however , the diagram of the carrier submarine is now much more interesting : with a few exceptions , the target remains in the blue area , which means that the carrier submarine is undetectable by the target .",
    "see the video version of this result @xcite for details .",
    "this numerical example shows that the two objectives can be realized .",
    "in this paper we have proposed an original and effective control strategy for sensor management in a context of uncertainty of the targets positions .",
    "four scenarios are considered , from simple academic case to realistic case .",
    "we showed that it is possible to plan a sensor trajectory even for possibly conflicting objectives . with partition technique , the execution time",
    "is significantly reduced and the approach can be performed in real time . although this partition method is sub - optimal , it gives very satisfactory results , keeping the carrier submarine position in the desired areas .",
