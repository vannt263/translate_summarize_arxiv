    "the correlation function of single ncs exhibits a non - ergodic behavior , as such these systems exhibit behavior very different than other single emitting objects .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the averaged intensity correlation function for the emitting ncs .",
    "for this aim we use a simple two state stochastic model . the motivation for the calculation is twofold .",
    "first , the averaged correlation function exhibits interesting aging behavior , as we will demonstrate .",
    "this aging behavior is a signal of non - ergodicity .",
    "secondly , to obtain understanding of non - ergodic properties of the correlation function , one must first understand how the averaged correlation function behaves . in a future publication",
    "we will discuss the non - ergodic behavior of the nc correlation function , namely the question of the distribution of correlation functions obtained from single trajectory measurements .",
    "aging in our context means that the ( non - normalized ) intensity correlation function @xmath15 and the normalized correlation @xmath16 depend on the the age of the process @xmath1 even in the limit of long times . here",
    "@xmath17 is the fluctuating stream of photons emitted from the nc ( units counts per second ) . in the ergodic phase ( i.e. when",

    "the average in ( [ eq0def ] ) is over many single nc intensity trajectories .",
    "previously , jung , barkai and silbey @xcite showed the relation of the problem to the lvy walk model @xcite .",
    "the approach in @xcite is based on the calculation of mandel s @xmath14 parameter and does not consider the aging properties of the ncs .",

    "this problem verberk and orrit introduce cutoffs on the _ on _ and _ off _ times .",
    "the results of verberk and orrit are different than ours : they do not exhibit aging and they are meant to describe the correlation function of a single trajectory ( however the ergodic problem was not considered ) .",

    "@xcite have measured aging behavior of a number of ncs .",
    "they concentrate on the measurement of the persistence probability ( see details below ) while this work is devoted to the investigation of the intensity correlation function .",
    "we note that concepts of statistical aging and persistence , used in this manuscript , were introduced previously in the context of the trap model and glassy dynamics by bouchaud and co - workers @xcite .",
    "statistical aging is found in continuous time random walks @xcite , and in deterministic dynamics of low dimensional chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "aging in complex dynamical systems , for example super - cooled liquids or glasses is a topic of much research @xcite .",
    "in contrast we will later show that aging in ncs may be a result of very simple physical processes ( e.g. normal diffusion ) .",

    "hence a charged nc is in _ off _ state .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the _ power law _ blinking ( i.e. charging ) behavior of ncs is still unclear .",
    "models based on trapping of charge carriers in the vicinity of the nc , and fluctuating barrier concepts were suggested in @xcite .",
    "here we will emphasize an alternative simple picture based on diffusion concepts . before further experiments are performed",
    ", it is impossible to say if the simple picture we consider here works better or worse than other approaches .",
    "we note that the simplest diffusion controlled chemical reaction @xmath8 , where @xmath54 is fixed in space , can be used to explain some of the observed behavior on the uncapped ncs . as mentioned the latter exhibit exponential distribution of _ on _ times and power law distribution of _ off _ times .",
    "the _ on _ times follow standard exponential kinetics corresponding to an ionization of a neutral nc ( denoted as _ ab _ ) . a model for this exponential behavior",
    "was given already in @xcite .",
    "once the nc is ionized ( @xmath55 state ) we assume the ejected charge carrier exhibits a random walk on the surface of the nc or in the bulk .",
    "this part of the problem is similar to onsager s classical problem of an ion pair escaping neutralization ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the survival probability in the _ off _ state for time _ t _ , @xmath56 is related to the _ off _ time distribution via @xmath57 , or @xmath58 it is well known that in three dimensions survival probability decays like @xmath59 , the exponent 1/2 is close to the exponent measured in the experiments .",
    "in infinite domain the decay is not to zero , but the 1/2 appears in many situations , for finite and infinite systems , in completely and partially diffusion controlled recombination , in different dimensions , and can govern the leading behavior of the survival probability for orders of magnitude in time @xcite . in this picture",
    "the exponent @xmath60 does not depend on temperature , similar to what is observed in experiment .",
    "we note that it is possible that instead of the charge carrier executing the random walk , diffusing lattice defects which serve as a trap for charge carrier are responsible for the blinking behavior of the ncs .",
    "one of the possible physical pictures explaining blinking of capped ncs can be based on diffusion process , using a variation of a three state model of @xcite . as mentioned in introduction , for this case power law distribution of _ on _ and _ off _ times are observed . in particular ,",
    "neutral capped nc will correspond to state _ on _ ( as for uncapped ncs ) .",
    "however , capped nc can remain _ on _ even in the ionized state .",
    "we assume that the ionized capped nc can be found in two states : ( i ) the charge remaining in the nc can be found in center of nc ( possibly a de - localized state ) , ( ii ) charge remaining in the nc can be trapped in vicinity of capping . for case ( i ) the nc will be in state _ off _",
    ", for case ( ii ) the nc will be in state _",
    "on_. the main idea is that the rate of auger nonradiative recombination @xcite of consecutively formed electron - hole pairs will drop for case ( ii ) but not for case ( i ) .",
    "we note that capping may increase effective radius of the nc , or provide trapping sites for the hole ( e.g. , recent studies by lifshitz et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that coating of ncs creates trapping sites in the interface ) .",
    "thus the _ off _ times occur when the nc is ionized and the hole is close to the center , these _ off _ times are slaved to the diffusion of the electron . while _ on _ times occur for both a neutral nc and for charged nc with the charge in vicinity of capping , the latter _ on _ times are slaved to the diffusion of the electron . in the case of power law _ off _ time statistics this model predicts same power law exponent for the _ on _ times , because both of them are governed by the return time of the ejected electron .",
    "the main point we would like to emphasize is that several simple mechanisms might be responsible for the power law statistics , and hence aging correlation functions in single molecule experiments may turn out to be wide spread . beyond single molecule spectroscopy",
    "we note that certain single ion channels @xcite , deterministic diffusion in chaotic systems @xcite , the sign of magnetization of spin systems at criticality @xcite , all exhibit intermittency behavior , and the correlation function we obtain here might be useful also in other fields .",
    "hence we do nt restrict our attention to the exponent 1/2 , as there are indications for other values of @xmath61 between 0 and 1 , and the analysis hardly changes .",
    "since the process under investigation is non - ergodic , and since measurements are made on a single molecule level , care must be taken in the definition of averages . from a single trajectory ( st ) of @xmath17 , recorded in a time interval @xmath62",
    ", we may construct the time average correlation function @xmath63 on the other hand we may generate many intensity trajectories one at a time , to obtain @xmath64 and @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath65 even in the limit of large @xmath1 and @xmath66 .",
    "moreover for non - ergodic processes , even in the limit of @xmath67 , @xmath68 is a random function which varies from one sample of @xmath17 to another .",
    "we stress that the single particle averaged correlation function is not the correlation function obtained from measurement of an ensemble of particles . to see this consider the intensity of @xmath69 blinking ncs , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is an index of the particle number .",
