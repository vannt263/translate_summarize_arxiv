    "many properties of ultracold gases are determined by the interparticle interaction which is characterized by the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "this makes it desirable to tune this parameter .",
    "a much - used method for this purpose is a magnetic feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "an alternative method is a photoassociation resonance , which is sometimes also called optical feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of photoassociation resonances is that the light intensity can be varied on short length and time scales , thus offering more flexible experimental control over the scattering length .",
    "the problem with photoassociation resonances is that the light induces inelastic collisions between atoms which lead to rapid loss of atoms .",
    "this is why photoassociation resonances have only rarely been used to tune the scattering length @xcite . a solution for this problem exists for alkali earth atoms where narrow intercombination lines allow for tuning of @xmath1 with only moderate loss @xcite .",
    "but this is not feasible in the large number of experiments with alkali atoms .    in a recent experiment",
    "@xcite we explored an alternative scheme for controlling the scattering length with laser light .",
    "this scheme uses the existing coupling between an atom - pair state @xmath2 and a molecular state @xmath3 near a feshbach resonance , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - scheme ] . by adding a light field that is somewhat detuned from a bound - to - bound transition between state @xmath3 and an electronically excited molecular state @xmath4",
    ", one can induce an ac - stark shift of state @xmath3 .",
    "this results in a shift of the magnetic field @xmath5 at which the feshbach resonance occurs .",
    "if the magnetic field @xmath6 is held close to the feshbach resonance , then spatial or temporal variations of the light intensity affect the scattering length .",
    "this scheme also suffers from light - induced inelastic collisions .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite we reported a two - body loss rate coefficient as small as @xmath7 @xmath8/s at parameters where the real part of the scattering length is changed by @xmath9 with respect to its background value @xmath10 .",
    "this represents a reduction of the loss rate by one order of magnitude compared to a photoassociation resonance in @xmath11rb where @xmath12 @xmath8/s was reported for the same change of @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "pairs of atoms , each in state @xmath14 , are coupled to a dimer state @xmath3 belonging to the electronic ground state .",
    "this coupling has a strength @xmath15 and causes a magnetic feshbach resonance .",
    "laser light is applied to drive a bound - to - bound transition from state @xmath3 to an electronically excited dimer state @xmath4 with rabi frequency @xmath16 .",
    "this causes an ac - stark shift ( not shown ) of state @xmath3 which leads to a shift of the magnetic field at which the feshbach resonance occurs .",
    "typically , the same light can also drive photoassociation from state @xmath2 to state @xmath4 with coupling strength @xmath17 .",
    "the photoassociation is a nuisance for the scheme used here .",
    "the light frequency is typically somewhat detuned from both transitions . ]    here we show experimentally that a value as low as @xmath18 @xmath8/s at @xmath19 can be reached with our scheme , thus reducing the loss rate by one more order of magnitude compared to our previous results .",
    "this improvement is achieved by increasing the detuning and the intensity of the laser light , which is a commonly used method for reducing incoherent rates in experiments , which rely on the ac - stark shift . when following this approach , two new issues have to be addressed .",
    "first , the detunings are no longer small compared to the typical splitting between the various hyperfine and magnetic substates of the excited state . achieving a large detuning with respect to all excited states thus requires knowledge of the positions of all nearby excited states , so that excited - state spectroscopy has to be performed , on which we report in sec .",
    "[ sec - spectroscopy ] .",
    "second , in our previous experiment @xcite we used a model for the temporal evolution of the cloud size to determine @xmath13 and @xmath20 .",
    "if the laser that drives the bound - to - bound transition is now operated at much larger power , then it creates a noticeable dipole trap . its rapid turn - on induces large - amplitude oscillations of the cloud size which are difficult to model .",
    "we therefore explore an alternative way of measuring @xmath13 and @xmath20 . to this end , we pin the positions of the atoms with a deep optical lattice which minimizes the effect of the additional dipole trap . in the lattice ,",
    "we use excitation spectroscopy and a loss measurement to determine @xmath13 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these results are reported in sec .",
    "[ sec - shift ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we also studied the behavior of the system when the laser light is tuned close to the bound - to - bound resonance . in this regime , we observed an autler - townes doublet in the loss rate coefficient as a function of magnetic field @xmath21 .",
    "in the same work , we presented a systematic study of the dependence of the positions @xmath5 of the loss resonances on laser power and detuning . in sec .",
    "[ sec - exp - autler ] of the present paper , we complement these measurements with a systematic study of the height and width of the resonances in this autler - townes doublet .",

    "states @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent a dimer in the electronic ground and excited state , respectively .",

    "laser light couples states @xmath3 and @xmath4 on a bound - to - bound transition with a rabi frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the same laser light drives photoassociation from state @xmath2 to @xmath4 characterized by a coupling strength @xmath17 .",
    "this model is closely related to previous studies of the combination of a feshbach resonance with a photoassociation resonance , see _",
    "e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite . unlike those references",
    ", we are mostly interested in the feshbach resonance and the bound - to - bound transition .",
    "the photoassociation is a nuisance in our scheme , because any useful change of @xmath13 that it induces is inevitably accompanied by the loss rates that limited the photoassociation experiments in refs .",
    "luckily , we find excited states in our experiment for which photoassociation is negligible .    before turning to a quantitative model",
    ", we present a qualitative argument that motivates why creating a given change in @xmath13 with our scheme causes a smaller loss rate than a photoassociation resonance would do .",
    "to explain this , we must first understand the limitation of the photoassociation resonance .",
    "if an infinite amount of laser intensity were available , then the value of @xmath20 caused by a photoassociation resonance could be reduced without modifying the change in @xmath13 . to this end",
    ", one would simply have to increase @xmath22 along with the laser intensity , see eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) .",
    "the same improvement could be achieved if a photoassociation resonance with a larger transition matrix element was available because that would be equivalent to having more laser intensity .",
    "our scheme relies on the fact that the typical interatomic distance is orders of magnitude larger in the atomic gas than within a single molecule . as a result , the transition matrix element is typically orders of magnitude smaller for a photoassociation resonance than for a bound - to - bound transition , see eq .",
    "( [ beta - small ] ) .",
    "hence at a given laser intensity , one can detune the laser pretty far in our scheme and still achieve a significant light - induced change in @xmath13 , whereas a photoassociation resonance driven with the same laser intensity requires a smaller laser detuning , which results in a larger loss rate .",

    "we call this the bound - to - bound light and employ the same laser beam previously used for the photoassociation spectroscopy .    in order to avoid loss of particles due to inelastic collisions between molecules , the atoms must be loaded into a deep optical lattice before associating the molecules @xcite . the lattice has a light wavelength of 830.440 nm and a depth of @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the atomic recoil energy . as in ref .",

    "this light has the same linear polarization as for the photoassociation spectroscopy .",
    "if a molecule in state @xmath3 is excited on a bound - to - bound transition , then it is likely to undergo spontaneous radiative decay into a different internal state . after turning off the bound - to - bound light",

    "subsequently , the optical dipole trap at 1064 nm is turned back on , the lattice depth is slowly ramped to zero , the cloud is released , @xmath6 is switched off , and the atom number is determined from a time - of - flight image .",
    "molecules that were excited by the laser are not dissociated and thus not detected .    a bound - to - bound spectrum measured at @xmath190 g",

    "the light frequency calibration for both spectra has a precision of @xmath198 mhz and can fluctuate within a single scan .",

    "the laser producing the bound - to - bound light was beat - locked to a frequency comb , resulting in a much better precision of the frequency calibration .",

    "our choice of the light wavelength for the experiments in the following sec .",
    "[ sec - shift ] is based on the spectra obtained here . in order to achieve a large detuning from all excited states",

    "the three outermost resonances at the low - frequency end of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] have fairly strong photoassociation loss features , but show hardly any bound - to - bound features , which is unfortunate .",

    "we therefore perform all the following experiments blue detuned from the high - frequency end of the spectrum in fig .  [ fig - spectrum ] . according to tab .",

    "hence , we choose @xmath186 polarization for the bound - to - bound light in all the following experiments .",
    "we note as a side remark , that our model , unlike ref .",

    "@xcite an indirect bound - to - bound coupling is constructed by invoking virtual transitions into the continuum of excited atom - pair states above threshold .",

    "we now use the spectroscopic information gathered above to shift the feshbach resonance with far - detuned light . as discussed in the introduction of this paper , we minimize the effect of the dipole trap created by the bound - to - bound light by working in a deep optical lattice .    in order to measure @xmath13 , we first load the atoms into the lattice as described in sec .",
    "[ sec - spectroscopy ] .",

    "the bound - to - bound light is on for a long enough time that sites containing two or more atoms are essentially emptied by light - induced inelastic collisions .",
    "the signal in the excitation spectrum that is sensitive to the modulation frequency thus stems from sites that were initially populated by one atom . for certain modulation frequencies , tunneling of an atom between two such sites",
    "is resonantly enhanced .",
    "this leads to a frequency - dependent loss of atoms and of atomic phase coherence . at the end of the modulation , we switch the bound - to - bound light off and simultaneously jump @xmath6 back to a value several gauss away from the feshbach resonance .",
    "next , the dipole trap at 1064 nm is turned back on and the lattice depth is slowly reduced to @xmath203 , where the gas is superfluid , thus restoring phase coherence between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "finally , the dipole trap , @xmath6 , and the lattice are simultaneously switched off .",
    "the time - of - flight image shows satellite peaks due to the restored phase coherence .",
    "the visibility @xcite of the satellite peaks displays a minimum at a modulation frequency where tunneling processes between two initially singly occupied sites are resonant .",

    "[ fig - shift](a ) . for parameters where",
    "@xmath13 is reduced drastically , the system becomes superfluid and the peak in the excitation spectrum is smeared out so much that its center can not be determined any more .",
    "hence , this method is not applicable in this regime . for comparison , the figure also shows @xmath13 measured with the same method , but in the absence of bound - to - bound light .",
    "clearly , the position @xmath5 of the feshbach resonance is shifted by @xmath209 g due to the presence of the light .",
    "we now turn to the question , how large a loss - rate coefficient @xmath20 is associated with this shift . in order to determine @xmath20 , we load the atoms into the lattice and associate molecules as described in sec .",
