    "consider a trader who wants to buy or sell a european option @xmath0 on asset @xmath1 with maturity @xmath2 and payoff @xmath3 .",
    "the trader wants to hedge this position , but the underlying asset @xmath1 is illiquid .",
    "however , some liquid proxies of @xmath1 are available in the marketplace .",
    "first , there is a financial index ( or simply an _ index _ ) @xmath4 ( such as e.g. s&p500 or cdx.na ) whose market price is correlated with @xmath1 . in addition , there is another correlated asset @xmath5 which has a liquidly traded option @xmath6 with a payoff @xmath7 similar to that of @xmath8 , and with the same maturity @xmath9 .",
    "the market price @xmath10 of @xmath6 is also known .",
    "our trader realizes that hedging @xmath1-derivative with the index @xmath4 alone may not be sufficient for a number of reasons .",
    "first , she might be faced with a situation where correlation coefficients @xmath11 ( which for simplicity are assumed to be constant ) are such that @xmath12 . in this case",
    "we would intuitively expect a better hedge produced by using @xmath5 or @xmath6 as the hedging instruments .",
    "second , if we bear in mind a stochastic volatility - type dynamics for @xmath1 , the stochastic volatility process may be `` unspanned '' , i.e. the volatility risk of the option may not be traded away by hedging in option s underlying .",
    "if that is the case , one might want to hedge the unspanned stochastic volatility by trading in a `` similar '' option with on the proxy asset @xmath5 .",
    "so our trader is contemplating a hedging strategy that would use both @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to capture an `` unspanned '' stochastic volatility",
    ", the trader wants to use a derivative @xmath15 written on @xmath14 rather than asset @xmath14 directly .    as transaction costs are usually substantially higher for options than for underlyings",
    ", our trader sets up a static hedge in @xmath16 and a dynamic hedge in @xmath17 .",
    "the static hedging strategy amounts to selling @xmath18 units of @xmath16 options at time @xmath19",
    ". an _ optimal _ hedging strategy would be composed of a pair @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the optimal static hedge , and @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) is an optimal dynamic hedging strategy in index @xmath17 .",
    "the pair @xmath20 should be obtained using a proper model .",
    "the same model should produce the highest / lowest price for which the trader should agree to buy or sell the @xmath1-option .    in this paper",
    "we develop a model that formalizes the above scenario by supplementing it with the specific dynamics for asset prices @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and providing criteria of optimality for pricing options @xmath8 . for the former ,",
    "we use a standard correlated log - normal dynamics . for the latter ,",
    "we employ the utility indifference framework with an exponential utility , pioneered by @xcite and others , see e.g. @xcite for a review . as will be shown below , this results in a tractable formulations with analytical ( in quadratures ) expressions for optimal hedges and option prices .    as the above setting of pricing and hedging an illiquid option position using a pair of liquid proxies ( e.g. a stock and an option on a different underlying ) is quite general",
    ", one could visualize its potential applications for various asset classes such as equities , commodities , fx etc .",
    "for definiteness , in this paper we concentrate on a problem of practical interest for counterparty credit risk management .",
    "namely , we consider the problem of pricing and hedging an exposure to a counterparty with an illiquid debt , and in the absence of liquidly traded cds referencing this counterparty .",
    "for such situation , no market - implied spreads are available for the counterparty in question . instead",
    ", one should rely on a model to come up with _ theoretical _ credit spreads for the counterparty . to this end",
    ", we use a version of the classical merton equity - credit model @xcite which is set up in a multi - name setting , and under the physical ( i.e. `` real '' , not `` risk - neutral '' ) measure .",
    "most importantly , unlike the classical merton s model , we do not intend to use firm s equity to hedge firm s debt . instead ,",
    "illiquid debt is hedged with a proxy liquid debt , and a proxy credit index . in what follows , to differentiate our framework from that of the classical merton model",
    ", we will refer to it as the hedged incomplete - market merton s dynamics , or himd for short .",
    "our model unifies three strands in the literature on indifference pricing .",
    "the fist strand deals with hedging an option with a proxy asset , as developed in @xcite , and others . in this setting , one typically hedges an option on an illiquid underlying with a liquid proxy asset",
    ".    the second strand develops generalizations of the classical merton credit - equity model to an incomplete market setting .",
    "typically , this is achieved by de - correlating asset value and equity price at the level of a single firm , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as long as we do not use firms equity to hedge firm s debt but instead use a liquid proxy bond as a hedge , such modification of the merton model is not needed in our setting .",
    "the third strand is presented by @xcite who develop a static - dynamic indifference hedging approach for barrier options .",
    "ilhan and sircar considers hedging a barrier option under stochastic volatility using static hedges in vanilla options on the same underlying plus a dynamic hedge in the underlying .",
    "this results in a two - dimensional hamilton - jacobi - bellmann ( hjb ) equation .",
    "our construction is similar but our hedges are a proxy asset and a proxy option , while volatility is taken constant for simplicity .",
    "borrowing from an approach of @xcite for a similar ( but not identical ) setting , we now show how the method of indifference utility pricing can be generalized to incorporate our scenario of a mixed dynamic - static hedge .    to this end , let @xmath26 be the final payoff of the portfolio consisting of our option positions , i.e. @xmath27 as long as both european options @xmath28 pay at the same maturity @xmath9 , we can view this as the payoff of a combined ( `` static hedge portfolio '' ) option @xmath29 , which involves payoffs @xmath3 and @xmath30 of both derivatives @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "such option may be priced using the standard utility indifference principle .",
    "the latter states that the derivative price @xmath31 is such that the investor should be indifferent to the choice between two investment strategies . with the first strategy",
    ", the investor adds the derivatives to her portfolio of bonds and stocks ( or indices in the setting of the merton s optimal investment problem . ] ) @xmath4 , thus taking @xmath29 from , and adding @xmath32 to her initial cash @xmath33 . with the second strategy",
    ", the investor stays with the optimal portfolio containing bonds and the stocks / indices .",
    "the value of each investment is measured in terms of the _ value function _ defined as the conditional expectation of utility @xmath34 of the terminal wealth @xmath35 optimized over trading strategies . in this work",
    ", we use an exponential utility function @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a risk - aversion parameter . in our case",
    ", the terminal wealth is given by the following expression : @xmath38 with @xmath39 be the total wealth at time @xmath9 in bonds and index @xmath13 . in turn",
    ", the value function reads @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a set of admissible trading strategies that require holding of initial cash @xmath33 .",
    "the expectation in the eq.([value_function ] ) is taken under the `` real - world '' measure @xmath42 .    for a portfolio made exclusively of stocks / indices and bonds ,",
    "the value function for the exponential utility is known from the classical merton s work : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the risk free interest rate assumed to be constant , and @xmath46 is the stock sharpe ratio .    in our setting , in addition to bonds and stocks / indices , we want to long @xmath8 option and short @xmath47 units of @xmath6 option to statically hedge our @xmath8 position , or , equivalently , buy the @xmath48 option .",
    "the value function in our problem of optimal investment in bonds , index and the composite option @xmath49 has the following form : @xmath50 where @xmath39 is a cash equivalent of the total wealth in bonds and the index at time @xmath9 .",
    "we represent it in a form similar to eq.([merton_vv ] ) : @xmath51 where function @xmath52 will be calculated in the next sections .",
    "the indifference pricing equation reads @xmath53 plugging this in eq.([merton_vv ] ) and eq.([vv_him ] ) and re - arranging terms , we obtain @xmath54 the highest price of the @xmath1-derivative is given by choosing the optimal static hedge given by the number @xmath47 of the @xmath5-derivatives , i.e. @xmath55 where we temporarily introduced subscript @xmath47 in @xmath56 to emphasize that the value function depends on @xmath47 through a terminal condition .",
    "to use eq.([indif_price_2 ] ) and thus be able to compute both the option price and optimal static hedge , we need to find the `` reduced '' value function @xmath52 . to this end",
    ", we first derive the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation for our model , and then obtain its analytical ( asymptotic ) solution .",
    "let @xmath57 be the dynamic investment strategy in the index @xmath17 at time @xmath58 starting with the initial cash @xmath33 , and @xmath59 be the markov generator of price dynamics corresponding to strategy @xmath60 .",
    "both the optimal dynamic strategy and the value function should be obtained as a solution of the hjb equation @xmath61    we assume that all state variables @xmath62 follow a geometric brownian motion process with constant drifts @xmath63 and volatilities @xmath64 @xmath65 if our total wealth at time @xmath66 is @xmath67 and we invest amount @xmath68 of this wealth into the index and the rest in a risk - free bond , the stochastic differential equation for @xmath69 is obtained as follows : @xmath70 then @xmath59 reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is defined on the domain @xmath73 $ ] .    since @xmath59 is a regular function of @xmath74 , @xmath75",
    "is achieved at @xmath76 plugging this into eq.([hjb ] ) , we obtain @xmath77 this is a nonlinear pde with respect to the dependent variable @xmath78 with standard boundary conditions ( see @xcite ) and the terminal condition determined by a choice of the writer s maximal expected utility ( value function ) of the terminal wealth @xmath35",
    ".    note that so far the derivation is valid for a generic utility function . to make further progress we specialize to the case of exponential utility in eq.([exputility ] ) since it gives rise to a natural dimension reduction of the hjb equation .",
    "indeed , the ansatz @xmath79 with @xmath80 is both consistent with terminal condition eq.([valuefunction ] ) and , upon substitution in ( [ pde ] ) , leads to a pde for function @xmath81 which does not contain variable @xmath82 : @xmath83 here @xmath84 equation eq.([gpdews ] ) is defined at the domain @xmath85 $ ] . the initial condition for this equation",
    "is obtained from eq.([valuefunction ] ) .    in",
    "what follows , we choose a specific payoff of the form eq.([payoff ] ) with @xmath86 that corresponds to a portfolio of bonds of firms @xmath14 and @xmath87 with notionals @xmath88 within the merton credit - equity model .",
    "then the terminal condition for @xmath89 reads @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we were not able to find a closed form solution of eq.([gpdews ] ) with the initial condition eq.([initcondws ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , a numerical solution of this equation is expensive , especially when it should be used many times for calibration to market data .",
    "therefore , we proceed with aasymptotic solutions of eq.([gpdews ] ) .",
    "we suggest two approaches to construct asymptotic solutions .",
    "as we want to statically hedge option @xmath8 with options on another underlying , we look for an asset @xmath14 that is strongly correlated with asset @xmath87 .",
    "further , if we have a `` similar '' option @xmath15 on asset @xmath14 ( i.e. similar maturity , type , strike , etc . ) , we expect that such option provides a good static hedge for our option @xmath8 . , but @xmath93",
    ". we may want to hedge an illiquid option with strike @xmath94 ( say , deep otm ) with a liquid option on the same underlying but with a different strike @xmath95 . under this setup",
    ", we have @xmath96 , i.e. a prefect correlation case . ]    therefore , a natural assumption would be to consider @xmath97 to be a small parameter under our setup .",
    "utilizing this idea we represent the solution of eq.([gpdews ] ) as a formal perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the small parameter to be precisely defined in the next section .    as we shown below , eq.([gpdews ] ) can be solved analytically ( in quadratures ) to any order of this expansion , thus significantly reducing the computation time .",
    "we start with a change of variables @xmath101 defined as follows : @xmath102 simultaneously , we change the dependent variable @xmath103 as follows : @xmath104 using eq.([gpdews ] ) , eq.([uv ] ) and eq.([changeoffun1 ] ) , we obtain the following pde for function @xmath105 : @xmath106 further we will show that @xmath107 is a slow ( `` adiabatic '' ) variable of our asymptotic method , while @xmath108 becomes a `` fast '' variable .    in what follows we need an inverse of eq.([uv ] ) at @xmath109 : @xmath110 using this in eq.([initcondws ] ) , we obtain the initial condition in @xmath111 variables for the function @xmath112 : @xmath113\\ ] ] where @xmath114 for any real @xmath82 .",
    "recall that a correlation matrix @xmath115 of @xmath116 assets can be represented as a gram matrix with matrix elements @xmath117 where @xmath118 are unit vectors on a @xmath119 dimensional hyper - sphere @xmath120 . using the 3d geometry , it is easy to establish the following _ cosine law _ for correlations between three assets : @xmath121 with @xmath122 being an angle between @xmath123 and its projection on the plane spanned by @xmath124 . as discussed e.g. by @xcite ,",
    "three variables @xmath125 are independent , but @xmath126 are not .",
    "therefore , one of them , e.g. @xmath127 , has to be found using eq.([cosine ] ) given @xmath128 .",
    "further we define @xmath100 as @xmath129 and also define the following constants @xmath130 using eq.([cosine ] ) and definitions in eq.([eps ] ) , eq.([theta_12 ] ) , coefficients at @xmath131 and @xmath132 in eq.([phi_uv ] ) are evaluated as follows : @xmath133 accordingly using this notation eq.([phi_uv ] ) takes the form @xmath134 in the limit @xmath135 this equation does not contain any derivatives wrt @xmath107 , therefore @xmath107 enters the equation only as a parameter ( since @xmath136 is a function of @xmath107 ) .",
    "we call this limit the _ adiabatic limit _ in a sense that will be explained below .",
    "it should be noted that our expansion in powers of @xmath98 can diverge if @xmath137 is very small .",
    "we exclude such situations on the `` financial '' grounds assuming that all pair - wise correlations in the triplet @xmath138 are reasonably high ( of the order of 0.4 or higher in practice ) , for our hedging set - up to make sense in the first place .",
    "thus , parameter @xmath139 is treated as @xmath140 is always @xmath140 and positive , parameter @xmath141 could be both positive and negative for typical values of correlations .",
    "for example , if @xmath142 , then @xmath143 , while for @xmath144 it is @xmath145 .",
    "the cosine law can also be used to find proper values of correlation parameters in the limit @xmath146 .",
    "to this end , we first use eq.([cosine ] ) to convert the estimated triplet @xmath147 into a triplet of independent variables @xmath148 , and then take the limit @xmath146 while keeping @xmath149 and @xmath150 constant . ] .",
    "it turns out that the last equation of the previous section could be further simplified . introducing new independent variables",
    "@xmath151 we can transform eq.([phi_uv_2 ] ) into the following equation @xmath152    it is seen that in new variables the mixed derivative drops from from the equation , as so does @xmath100 .",
    "however , further let us formally introduce a multiplier @xmath153 in the term @xmath154 which transforms eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) into @xmath155 let us also formally assume that @xmath153 is small under certain conditions .",
    "the idea of this trick is as follows .",
    "one way to construct an asymptotic solution of the eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) is to assume that all derivatives are of the order @xmath140 , and then estimate all the coefficients . if one manages to find a coefficient which is @xmath156 , then it is possible to build an asymptotic expansion using that coefficient ( or @xmath153 itself ) as a small parameter .",
    "if , however , all the coefficients in the considered pde are of order @xmath140 we need to check if perhaps some of the derivatives in the eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) are small , e.g. @xmath156 . if this is the case , in order to apply standard asymptotic methods we formally have to add a small parameter @xmath153 as a multiplier to the derivative which is @xmath156 , , where @xmath157 make an asymptotic expansion on @xmath153 , solve the obtained equations in every order on @xmath153 , and at the end in the final solution put @xmath158 .",
    "that is exactly the way we want to proceed with .",
    "this means that instead of the eq.([expan ] ) , we now have the following expansion : @xmath159    to find conditions when @xmath154 could be small as compared with the other terms in the eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) , we use an inverse map at @xmath160 this is a regular map . ]",
    "@xmath161 and rewrite the payoff function eq.([initcondws ] ) in the form @xmath162 , \\\\",
    "\\omega_1 & = \\bar{v}\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\sqrt{\\theta_2 } } , \\qquad \\omega_2 = \\bar{v } \\frac{\\theta_3}{\\beta \\sqrt{\\theta _ 2 } } , \\qquad \\zeta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\theta_2 } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    suppose that @xmath163 or @xmath164 .",
    "differentiating the payoff twice by @xmath165 and twice by @xmath107 and computing the ratio of the first and second terms in the rhs of the eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) , one can see that in the limit @xmath135 this ratio becomes @xmath166 .",
    "typical values @xmath167 give rise to @xmath168 , therefore the second term is small as compared with the first one , and @xmath153 is a good small parameter .",
    "this , however changes if @xmath169 is small or / and @xmath170 is close to 1 , and then @xmath171 . still in this case",
    "we have @xmath172 which can be used as a small parameter .",
    "therefore , our approach is as follows :    1 .   if @xmath173 we use eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) and find its asymptotic solutions using eq.([expan1 ] )",
    "this is better than using eq.([phi_uv_2 ] ) because first , @xmath153 is typically smaller then @xmath100 , and second , the term @xmath154 in our first method eq.([expan ] ) appears only in the second order of approximation while in the second method it is taken into account already in the first order on @xmath153 .",
    "if , however , @xmath174 , then @xmath153 is not anymore a small parameter , therefore we use eq.([phi_uv_2 ] ) and solve it asymptotically using eq.([expan ] ) .    in general , this argument can not be applied if @xmath175 or @xmath176 because then both derivatives of the payoff vanish .",
    "however , the above argument is intended to provide an intuition as to why @xmath154 could be much smaller that the other terms in the rhs of eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) .",
    "this intuition can be verified numerically , and our test examples clearly demonstrate that smallness of @xmath153 often takes place .",
    "below we discuss under which conditions this could occur .    note that at the first glance , the described method looks similar to the quasi - classical approximation in quantum mechanics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity comes from the observation that transformation eq.([uchange ] ) is singular in @xmath100 which is similar to the quasi - classical limit @xmath177 . if we would construct an asymptotic expansion on @xmath100 we would expand the rhs of the eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) on @xmath100 , but not the payoff function .",
    "after getting the solution of eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) in zero - order approximation on @xmath100 as a function of @xmath178 , we would apply the inverse transformation @xmath179 which is non - singular .",
    "therefore , the final result would not contain any singularity .",
    "since @xmath180 is defined via @xmath181 and @xmath182 , it could seem that @xmath183 , and we face a `` quasi - classical '' situation .",
    "however , as explained above , the independent parameters are @xmath184 and @xmath185 . therefore , by definition @xmath186 does nt depend on @xmath187 , or on @xmath100 .",
    "thus , our two methods actually correspond to different assumptions .",
    "the first one utilizes a strong correlation between assets z and y. the second assumes a strong correlation between index @xmath4 and asset @xmath1 while at the same time the vector of correlation @xmath169 in 3d space is not collinear to the vector of correlation @xmath127 . by financial sense",
    "this means ( see eq.([cosine ] ) ) the following .    1 .",
    "either @xmath169 is about 1 and , therefore , @xmath188 . in other words ,",
    "index @xmath4 strongly correlates to asset z , so @xmath4 is almost @xmath1 , therefore correlation of y and z ( @xmath187 ) is close to correlation of y and x ( @xmath127 ) . that , in turn , means that asset z can be dynamically hedged with @xmath4 , and extra static hedge with y does nt bring much value",
    "in contrast , under the former assumption static hedge plays an essential role .",
    "@xmath189 which means that @xmath190 . for instance , @xmath191 .",
    "this is an interesting case , since it differs from two previously considered assumptions on high value of either @xmath187 or @xmath169 .",
    "indeed , all correlations could be relatively moderate while providing a smallness of @xmath141 .    in what follows , we describe in detail the asymptotic solutions for zero and first order approximations in @xmath153 , and outline a generalization of our approach to an arbitrary order in @xmath153 .",
    "asymptotic solutions in @xmath100 are constructed in a very similar way and are given in appendix  [ a ] . also to make our notation lighter in the next section we",
    "will us @xmath107 instead of @xmath192 since that should not bring any confusion .",
    "in the zero order approximation we set @xmath193 , so that eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) does not contain derivatives wrt @xmath107 : @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , dependence of the solution on @xmath107 is determined by the terminal condition . in other words ,",
    "our system changes along variable @xmath165 , but it remains static ( i.e. of the order of @xmath196 slow ) in variable @xmath107 .",
    "using analogy with physics , we call this limit the _ adiabatic limit_.    the last equation can be solved by a change of dependent variable ( closely related to the hopf - cole transform , see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath197^{1/(1- \\bar{\\rho}_{xz}^2)}\\ ] ] which reduces eq.([zeroeq ] ) to the heat equation @xmath198 subject to the initial condition @xmath199 .",

    "however , for numerical efficiency it might be better to use another method which is based on a simple observations that the expression in square brackets in the eq.([phi_0_sol ] ) is just a gauss transform of the payoff .",
    "this transform can be efficiently computed using a fast gauss transform algorithm which in our case is @xmath209 with @xmath210 being the number of grid points in @xmath165 space .      for the first correction in eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) we obtain the following pde @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "this is an inhomogeneous _ linear _ pde with variable coefficients .",
    "as long as our zero - order solution of eq.([zeroeq ] ) already satisfies the initial condition , this equation has to be solved subject to the zero initial condition .",
    "this considerably simplifies the further construction .",

    "indeed , if one wants the final precision to be about @xmath230 at @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) , the number of important terms @xmath233 in expansion eq.([expan1 ] ) could be rawly calculated as @xmath234 , which gives @xmath235 , while at precision @xmath236 this yields @xmath237 .",
    "note that all integrals with @xmath238 do not admit a closed form representation and have to be computed numerically .",

    "our tests showed that the number of terms in the double sum that should be kept is small , namely truncating the upper limit in @xmath240 from infinity to @xmath241 produces nearly identical results .",
    "therefore , the total complexity of calculation is about 45 computations of @xmath242 and @xmath243 functions which is very fast . a typical time required for this at a standard pc with",
    "the cpu frequency 2.3 ghz ranges from 0.68 sec ( test 1 ) to 0.35 sec ( test 2 ) ( see below ) .",
    "the other test is performed using a numerical solution of eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) . in doing",
    "so we use an implicit finite difference scheme built in a spirit of @xcite .",
    "after the original non - linear equation is discretized to obtain the value function at the next time level , we need to solve a 2d algebraic system of equations each of which contains a non - linear term .",
    "this could be done e.g. by applying a fixed point iterative method ( @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , at the first iteration as an initial guess we plug - in into the non - linear term the solution obtained at the previous level of time .",
    "this reduces the equation to a linear one since the non - linear term is explicitly approximated at this iteration .",
    "next we solve the resulting 2d system of equations with a block - band matrix using a 2d lu factorization . at the second iteration",
    ", the solution obtained in such a way is substituted into the non - linear term again , so again it is approximated explicitly .",
    "then the new system of linear equations is solved and the new approximation of the solution of the original non - linear equation is obtained .",
    "we continue this process until it converges . the number of iterations to needed for numerical convergence depends on gradients of the value function , which are considerably influenced by the value of @xmath37 . for small values of @xmath37 ( about 0.03 )",
    "we need about 1 - 2 iterations , while for @xmath244 , 5 - 7 iterations might be necessary . for higher values of @xmath37 , the fixed point iteration scheme could even diverge",
    ", so another method has to be used instead .",
    "it is also important to note that we solve the non - linear equation using the dependent variable @xmath245 , rather than @xmath246 to reduce relative gradients of the solution .",

    "2d parabolic equations with mixed derivatives more efficient splitting schemes exist , see e.g. @xcite . in principle",
    ", such schemes could be adopted to solve eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) .",
    "though eq.([phi_vv_2 ] ) is a _ non - linear _ equation , the presence of the non - linear term does not change its type ( it is still a parabolic equation ) , and second , does not affect stability of the scheme if we approximate it implicitly and solve the resulting non - linear algebraic equations .",
    "a more detailed description of this modification of the splitting scheme of hout and welfert will be presented elsewhere .",
    "implementation of the numerical algorithm is done similar to @xcite . in typical tests",

    "a 3d plot of the value function @xmath250 is presented for the initial parameters marked in table  [ tab ] as test 1. we also use @xmath251 .",

    "the first plot presents comparison of the numerical solution with zero and 0 + 1 approximations .",
    "the second plot compares the zero and first order approximation .",
    "it is seen that the first approximation makes a small correction to the zero one in the region closed to @xmath252 . also both 0 \" and 0 + 1 approximations fit the exact numerical solution relatively well .",
    "this proves that our asymptotic closed form solution is robust .",
    "results obtained with a second set of parameters ( test 2 in the table  [ tab ] ) are shown in fig  [ comp2 ] . in fig  [ price ]",
    "we present price @xmath263 computed in tests 1,2 as a function of @xmath264 , where @xmath10 is black - scholes put price with parameters of the corresponding tests .",
    "note that for values of parameters used above the nonlinear term is small , therefore the solution is closed to the solution of the linear 2d heat equation obtained from the eq.([phi_uv_2 ] ) by omitting the nonlinear term . that is because @xmath37 is small in our test 1 . to make testing more interesting , we changed @xmath37 to @xmath265 .",
    "results obtained for @xmath9 = 3 yrs are presented in fig  [ compgamma3 ] for test 1 . and in fig  [ compgamma4 ] for test 2 .",
    "it is seen that in this case the 0 + 1 analytical approximation still fits the numerical solution .",
    "the computational time in these tests is higher because the matrix root solver converges slower .",
    "the typical time at @xmath9=3yrs and @xmath47 = 1 is 24 secs .",
    "computation of the analytical approximation requires the same time as before which is about 1 sec .",
    "if the exponent of the payoff function is positive , e.g. at @xmath47 = 2 and other parameters as in test 1 , then the solution looks like a delta function . under such conditions any numerical method experiences a problem being unable to resolve very high gradients within just few nodes .",
    "therefore , in this case one has to exploit a non - uniform grid saturated close to the peak of the value function .",
    "this brings extra complexity to the numerical scheme while our analytical approximation is free of such problems .    on the other hand",
    "it is natural to statically hedge @xmath8 option with the option @xmath6 with same or close moneyness .",
    "this significantly reduces the exponent and allows one to use the same mesh even at high values of the risk aversion parameter @xmath37 .    as the numerical performance of the model depends on the value of @xmath266 , a few comments are due at this point . though we do not address calibration of our model in the present paper ( leaving it for future work ) , the value of @xmath266 should be found by calibrating the model to market data .",
    "it is not entirely obvious how to do this since we use an illiquid asset @xmath1 , and moreover the price of our complex option @xmath263 is not an additive sum of its components for incomplete markets .",
    "it therefore makes sense to calibrate the model to another set of instruments that are both liquid and strongly correlated with the original instruments . in the context of equity options , such calibration of @xmath266",
    "was done in @xcite , giving rise to values of @xmath267 .",
    "while it is not exactly clear how @xmath37 found in this setting is related to @xmath37 of our original problem , we expect the latter to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "note that the results in fig.[compgamma4 ] clearly demonstrate that the proposed method is just asymptotic .",
    "indeed , the first correction to the solution in fig.[compgamma4 ] is a few times larger then the zero - order solution .",
    "as usual , there exists an optimal number of terms in the asymptotic series that fit the exact solution best .",
    "we do not pursue such analysis in this paper , however due to our definition of @xmath100 via @xmath187 this is not an interesting case . ] .    to characterize sharpness of the peak in the value function",
    "it is further convenient to introduce a new parameter @xmath268 .",
    "if @xmath269 is high , e.g. @xmath270 the value function is almost a delta function , so the asymptotic solution as well as its numerical counterpart are not expected to produce correct results unless they are further modified . based on the results of @xcite one can see that the value of @xmath269 calibrated to the market varies from 0.01 to 15 .",
    "therefore , in our test 2 we used @xmath269 = 20 .",
    "both our numerical and asymptotic methods work with no problem for these values of @xmath271 .    in fig  [ alphastar ] the optimal hedge @xmath272",

    "the initial parameters correspond to test 1 in table  [ tab ] in the first plot , and test 2 in the second plot .",
    "note that for @xmath273 ( the first plot ) and @xmath274 ( the second plot ) , eq.([indif_price_2 ] ) does not have a minimum , so the maximum is obtained at the edge of the chosen interval of @xmath47 .",
    "the latter could be defined based on some other preferences of the trader , for instance , the total capital she wants to invest into this strategy etc .",
    "finally , in fig  [ pricealphagamma ] price @xmath263 is presented as a function of @xmath47 for various @xmath37 .",
