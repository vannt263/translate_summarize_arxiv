    "the optimal entropic uncertainty relation for a couple of conjugate continuous variables ( position and momentum ) is known for almost 40 years @xcite .",
    "one decade later , entropic formulation of the uncertainty principle has as well been developed in the discrete settings @xcite .",
    "even though , the topic of entropic uncertainty relations ( eurs ) has a long history ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) , one can observe a recent increase of interest within the quantum information community leading to several improvements @xcite or even a deep asymptotic analysis of different bounds @xcite .",
    "this is quite understandable , because the entropic uncertainty relations have various applications , for example in entanglement detection @xcite , security of quantum protocols @xcite , quantum memory @xcite or as an ingredient of einsteinpodolskyrosen steering criteria @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent discussion @xcite about the original heisenberg idea of uncertainty , led to the entropic counterparts of the noise - disturbance uncertainty relation @xcite ( also obtained with quantum memory @xcite ) .",
    "my favorite example of entropic description of uncertainty @xcite is situated in between the continuous and the discrete scenario .",
    "continuous position and momentum variables , while studied with the help of coarse - grained measurements lead to discrete probability distributions .",
    "this particular formulation of the uncertainty principle has been long ago recognized @xcite to faithfully capture the spirit of position - momentum duality .",
    "it also carries a deep physical insight , since the coarse - grained version of the heisenberg uncertainty relation is non - trivial for any coarse - graining ( given in terms of two widths @xmath0 and @xmath1 in positions and momenta respectively ) provided that the both widths are finite @xcite . on the practical level ,",
    "coarse - grained entropic relations are experimentally useful for entanglement @xcite and steering detection @xcite in continuous variable schemes .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to strengthen the theoretical and experimental tools based on the coarse - grained eurs by taking an advantage of the recent improvements of discrete entropic inequalities , in particular , the one based on majorization @xcite .",
    "let me start with a brief description of the entropic uncertainty landscape , with a special emphasis on the majorization approach developed recently .",
    "the standard position - momentum scenario deals with the sum of the continuous shannon ( or in general rnyi ) entropies @xmath2 calculated for both densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 describing positions and momenta respectively .",
    "the position and momentum wave functions are mutually related by the fourier transformation .",
    "the discrete eurs rely on the notion of the rnyi entropy of order @xmath5 @xmath6=\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\ln\\sum_{i}p_{i}^{\\alpha},\\ ] ] and the sum - inequalities of the general form @xmath7+h_{\\beta}\\left[p\\left(b;\\varrho\\right)\\right]\\geq b_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(a , b\\right)\\label{eurgen}\\ ] ] valid for any density matrix @xmath8 , and two non - degenerate observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "if by @xmath11 and @xmath12 we denote the eigenstates of the two observables in question , the associated probability distributions entering ( [ eurgen ] ) are : @xmath13 the lower bound @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath8 , but only on the unitary matrix @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , the most recognized result by maassen and uffink @xcite gives the bound @xmath16 , valid whenever @xmath17 the couple @xmath18 constrained as in eq .",
    "( [ conjugate ] ) is often referred to as the conjugate parameters .      in the majorization approach one",
    "looks for the probability vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 which majorize the tensor product @xcite and the _ direct sum _ @xcite of the involved distributions ( [ distributions ] ) : @xmath21 @xmath22 the majorization relation @xmath23 between any two @xmath24-dimensional probability vectors implies that for all @xmath25 we have @xmath26 , with a necessary equality when @xmath27 . in agreement with the usual notation , the symbol",
    "@xmath28 denotes the decreasing order , what means that @xmath29 , for all @xmath30 . in the case",
    "when the vectors compared in ( [ maj1 ] ) and ( [ maj2 ] ) are of different size , the shorter vector shall be completed by a proper number of coordinates equal to @xmath31 . the tensor product @xmath32",
    "( also called the kronecker product ) is a @xmath33-dimensional probability vector with the coefficients equal to @xmath34 while the direct sum @xmath35 is a @xmath36-dimensional probability vector given by @xmath37    one of the most important properties of the rnyi entropy of any order @xmath5 is its additivity @xmath38+h_{\\alpha}\\left[y\\right]=h_{\\alpha}\\left[x\\otimes y\\right].\\label{add1}\\ ] ] moreover , in the special case of the shannon entropies ( @xmath39\\equiv h\\left[\\cdot\\right]$ ] ) one easily finds that @xmath40+h\\left[y\\right]=h\\left[x\\oplus y\\right].\\label{add2}\\ ] ] since the presumed majorization relations ( [ maj1 ] , [ maj2 ] ) are valid for every @xmath8 , the schur - concavity of the rnyi ( shannon ) entropy together with ( [ add1 ] , [ add2 ] ) immediately lead to the corresponding bounds @xmath41 $ ] @xcite and @xmath42 $ ] @xcite .",
    "due to the subadditivity property of the function @xmath43 the validity of the latter bound can be extended @xcite to the range @xmath44 ( in that case the function @xmath45 is as well schur - concave ) , i.e. @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath47 , this bound can be appropriately modified to the weaker form @xcite @xmath48=\\frac{2}{1-\\alpha}\\left[\\ln\\left(1+\\sum_{i}w_{i}\\right)-\\ln2\\right].\\label{modified}\\ ] ]    the whole families of the vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 fulfilling ( [ maj1 ] ) and ( [ maj2 ] ) have been explicitly constructed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to obtain the counterpart of the majorizing vector @xmath20 applicable to the position - momentum coarse - grained scenario described in detail in the forthcoming section [ subsec1b ] . in section [ secionmaj ]",
    "we derive this vector using the sole idea of majorization , so that we shall omit here a detailed prescription established in @xcite .",
    "we restrict the further discussion to the direct - sum approach , since for @xmath44 ( this case covers the sum of two shannon entropies ) , the _ direct - sum entropic uncertainty relation _ is always stronger than the corresponding tensor - product eur @xcite .",
    "the last set of ingredients we shall introduce , contains the coarse - grained probabilities together with their eurs .",
    "due to coarse - graining , the continuous densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 become the discrete probabilities : @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the sum of the rnyi entropies @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] calculated for the probabilities ( [ rs ] ) is lower - bounded by @xcite @xmath57,\\label{boundy}\\ ] ] where @xcite @xmath58 and @xcite @xmath59 once more the above results are valid only for conjugate parameters ( [ conjugate ] ) , so that we label the bound ( [ ibb ] ) only by the index @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath60 is the `` 00 '' radial prolate spheroidal wave function of the first kind @xcite . when @xmath61 , the spheroidal term in ( [ lr ] ) becomes negligible and we have @xmath62 so that the bound ( [ ibb ] ) dominates in this regime . in the opposite case , when @xmath63 the bound ( [ ibb ] )",
    "is negative , so starting from some smaller ( @xmath5-dependent ) value of @xmath64 the second bound @xmath65 becomes significant .",
    "after the short but comprehensive introduction , we are in position to formulate the main result of this paper .",
    "assume that a sum of any @xmath66 position probabilities @xmath67 and any @xmath68 momentum probabilities @xmath69 is bounded by @xmath70 , that is ( @xmath71 ) @xmath72 for some indices @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we implicitly assume here that @xmath75 does not depend on the specific choice of the probabilities in the sum ( it bounds any choice ) , and that @xmath76 since the left hand side of ( [ g ] ) can not exceed @xmath77 .",
    "denote further by @xmath78 assume now that @xmath79 , @xmath80 is an increasing sequence @xmath81 if that happens , the construction of the vector @xmath82 applicable to the direct - sum majorization relation , i.e. such that @xmath83 can be patterned after @xcite : @xmath84 for @xmath85 . due to ( [ inc ] ) the coefficients @xmath86 are all non - negative , so that they form a probability vector .",
    "note that @xmath87 , since one picks up only a single probability ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 or @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) , and that @xmath92 , because whenever the quantum state is localized ( in position or momentum ) in a single bin , the left hand side of ( [ g ] ) is equal to @xmath77 .",
    "this is in accordance with an expectation that @xmath82 is the probability vector .",
    "one can check by a direct inspection that @xmath93 what together with ( [ g ] ) and ( [ f ] ) is the essence of majorization . as in the case of discrete majorization @xcite",
    ", there is a whole family ( labeled by @xmath94 ) of majorizing vectors @xmath95 given by the prescription @xmath96 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 when @xmath100 . in that notation ,",
    "the basic vector ( [ wi ] ) is equivalent to @xmath101 , and the following majorization chain does hold @xmath102    the remaining task is to find the candidates for the coefficients @xmath79 . to this end",
    "we shall define two sets : @xmath103,\\qquad y\\left(\\delta\\right)=\\bigcup_{b=1}^{n}\\left[l_{b}^{-}\\delta , l_{b}^{+}\\delta\\right],\\ ] ] which are simply the unions of intervals associated with the probabilities present in ( [ g ] ) .",
    "the measures of these sets are equal to @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "( [ g ] ) rewritten in terms of the above sets simplifies to the form @xmath106 following lenard @xcite , we shall further introduce two projectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 , such that for any function @xmath109 , the function @xmath110 has its support equal to @xmath111 and the fourier transform of the function @xmath112 is supported in @xmath113 . if both @xmath111 and @xmath113 are intervals , then according to theorem 4 from @xcite ( this theorem in fact formalizes the content of eq .",
    "17 from @xcite ) the formal candidate for @xmath75 is the square root of the largest eigenvalue @xmath114 of the compact , positive operator @xmath115 . due to proposition 11 ( including the discussion around it ) from @xcite ,",
    "the above statement remains valid for any sets @xmath111 and @xmath113 . as concluded by lenard , this is a generalization of the seminal results by landau and pollak @xcite , who for the first time quantified uncertainty using spheroidal functions .",
    "it however happens @xcite , that @xmath114 has the largest value exactly in the interval case , so that it can always be upper bounded by the eigenvalue found by landau and pollak : @xmath116^{2},\\label{17}\\ ] ] with @xmath117 being the product of the measures of the two sets in question , that is @xmath118 . since the right hand side of ( [ 17 ] ) is an increasing function of @xmath117 , we can easily find the maximum in ( [ f ] ) .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath119 with fixed @xmath120 is given by possibly equal contributions of the both numbers .",
    "since @xmath66 and @xmath68 are integers we finally get @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 denote the integer valued ceiling and floor functions respectively . and @xmath124 .",
    "] if @xmath125 is odd then @xmath126 , and @xmath127 in the simpler case when @xmath125 is an even number .",
    "note that the functions ( [ f-1 ] ) form the increasing sequence as desired .",
    "the major result of the above considerations is thus the family of new majorization entropic uncertainty relations ( @xmath94 ) :    @xmath128+h_{\\alpha}\\bigl[p^{\\delta}\\bigr]\\geq\\mathcal{r}_{\\alpha}^{(n)}\\left(\\delta\\delta/\\hbar\\right)\\equiv h_{\\alpha}\\bigl[w^{(n)}\\left(\\delta\\delta/\\hbar\\right)\\bigr],\\label{meurcg}\\ ] ]    valid for @xmath44 .",

    "1 , for the case of the shannon entropy ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "i depicted the first three majorization - based bounds ( black , solid lines ) since they are sufficient to capture the whole content of the new uncertainty relations .",
    "first of all , only the bound for @xmath140 is slightly weaker than the remaining majorization bounds in the regime of larger @xmath64 , while there is no difference between @xmath141 , @xmath138 and other ( not presented ) values of @xmath142 . for @xmath143 ,",
    "all the black curves exhibit the same behavior , so that one can take an advantage of the asymptotic expansion @xcite @xmath144^{2}\\sim1 - 2\\sqrt{\\pi\\gamma}e^{-\\gamma/2},\\ ] ] in order to show that @xmath145 for all @xmath94 .",
    "the same expansion studied for the previous bound ( [ lr ] ) leads to @xmath146 the asymptotic value of ( [ asy1 ] ) is larger than ( [ asy2 ] ) by a divergent factor @xmath147 . since the bound",
    "( [ lr ] ) for the sum of two shannon entropies is always weaker than the couple @xmath148 and @xmath149 , it is in this case sufficient to use only these two bounds .",
    "obviously , the bound @xmath150 remains useful ( as being always non - negative ) for the conjugated parameters @xmath18 with @xmath151 , when the majorization bounds do not apply .",
    "let me remind , that in the limiting case @xmath152 , @xmath153 , the bound @xmath150 is optimal and can be saturated for any value of @xmath64 .",
    "while increasing the number @xmath142 we do not change the tail of the bound , we still substantially improve the area of small @xmath64 .",
    "taking the limit @xmath154 one can recognize that the optimal majorization bound @xmath155 , behaves like @xmath156 , so is still far below the bound @xmath148 . to show that property one needs to associate @xmath157 in ( [ wi ] ) with a continuous variable @xmath158 , so that @xmath159,\\label{wi-1}\\ ] ] and use the definition of the riemann integral .",
    "this kind of behavior is somehow typical in the majorization approach to entropic uncertainty relations . in the discrete case",
    ", the tensor - product eur ( weaker than the direct - sum eur used in this paper ) can outperform the maassen - uffink result in more than @xmath160 of cases @xcite , even for a small dimension of the hilbert space equal to @xmath161 .",
    "but the maassen - uffink lower bound @xcite always dominates when @xmath162 is sufficiently close to the fourier matrix , so that both eigenbases of the observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 become mutually unbiased .",
    "the continuous limit @xmath154 is of exactly the same sort , since the resulting continuous densities originate from the wave functions in position and momentum spaces , which are related by the fourier transformation .",
    "note that the behavior in the limit @xmath154 does not thus permit us to derive counterparts of the continuous eurs @xcite , valid for @xmath163 .",
    "the direct - sum majorization entropic uncertainty relation for coarse - grained observables given by eq .",
    "( [ meurcg ] ) is the first known bound in the case @xmath163 and @xmath164 . in the shannon case , the bound ( [ boundy ] ) holds as well and the comparison of all bounds is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the new bounds ( black , solid lines ) significantly improve the previously known results in the regime of @xmath165 ( this threshold value is an intersection point between the red dashed line and the black line labeled by @xmath138 ) .",
    "such regime of relevance ( @xmath165 ) is of practical importance . in @xcite ,",
    "entanglement of a two - mode gaussian state has been experimentally confirmed with the coarse - graining widths @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 and @xmath169 . to construct the entanglement criteria , one needs to put @xmath170 inside the underlying uncertainty relation ( the factor of @xmath171 comes from different normalization of global quadratures ) , so that the above numbers boil down to the value @xmath172 .",
    "even though , we observe a tiny overlap between the regime in which the new eur outperforms the previous results and the parameters from @xcite , for slightly larger coarse graining , say @xmath173 , the value of the bound increases by @xmath174 because @xmath175 .",
    "this however suggests , that with the new bound at hand , one could improve the performance of the entanglement criteria and possibly detect entanglement beyond the cases reported in @xcite .",
    "the better detection ability might become important while dealing with multipartite entanglement @xcite , since due to the increasing number of degrees of freedom , the coarse - grained measurements might appear to be the one feasible experimental method @xcite .    in the discrete scenario with almost mutually unbiased bases the maassen  uffink bound always outperforms the majorization approach .",
    "it however still can be improved with the help of the monotonicity property of the relative entropy @xcite , or by combining the former approach with the majorization techniques @xcite . in the continuous case",
    "this type of analysis is far more difficult , since we actually do not have in our disposal the unitary matrix @xmath176 such that @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the probability amplitudes reproducing ( [ rs ] ) , @xmath179 from the beginning we deal with the _ per se _ probabilities @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "this fundamental difference can be overcome if one introduces an additional degree of freedom @xcite corresponding to the orthonormal bases on the intervals @xmath182 $ ] and @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "even though , this approach brings the valid unitary matrix @xmath176 , the remaining optimization required by @xcite becomes a challenging task .",
