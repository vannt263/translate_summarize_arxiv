    "the analogy between complex quantum dots and real molecules was recognized both by experimentalists and theoreticians at early stage of studies of these artificial nanoobjects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of the kondo effect in tunneling through quantum dots ( qd ) @xcite , it was recognized that this phenomenon may be realized in tunneling through complex quantum dots consisting of two or three electron puddles ( double ant triple quantum dots ) @xcite .",
    "tunneling through these `` artificial linear molecules '' has been studied mainly in serial and parallel configurations , where the dots are ordered linearly either parallel or perpendicular to the metallic leads . meanwhile ,",
    "modern experimental methods allow also fabrication of quantum dots in a triangular geometry .",
    "triangular triple quantum dot ( ttqd ) was considered theoretically @xcite and realized experimentally very recently , @xcite in order to demonstrate the ratchet effect in single electron tunneling . to achieve this effect",
    "the authors proposed a configuration , where two of the three puddles are coupled in series with the leads ( source and drain ) , while the third one has a tunnel contact with one of its counterparts and only a capacitive coupling with the other .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the _ point symmetry _ of ttqd and its interplay with the _ spin rotation symmetry _ in a context of kondo tunneling through this artificial molecule .",
    "indeed , the generic feature of kondo effect is the involvement of internal degrees of freedom of localized `` scatterer '' in the interaction with continuum of electron - hole pair excitations in the fermi sea of conduction electrons .",
    "these are spin degrees of freedom in conventional kondo effect , although in some cases the role of pseudospin may be played by configuration quantum numbers , like in two - level systems and related objects .",
    "@xcite ttqd may be considered as a specific kondo object , where both spin and configuration excitations are involved in cotunneling on equal footing .    to demonstrate this interplay",
    ", we consider a fully symmetric ttqd consisting of three identical puddles with the same individual properties ( energy levels and coulomb blockade parameters ) and inter - dot coupling ( tunnel amplitudes and electrostatic interaction .",
    "like in the above mentioned triangular ratchet @xcite , we assume that the ttqd in the ground state is occupied by one electron and coulomb blockade is strong enough to completely suppress double occupancy of any valley @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the only mechanism of electron transfer through ttqd is cotunneling , where one electron leaves the valley @xmath1 for metallic leads , whereas another electron tunnels from reservoir to the same valley @xmath1 or to another valley @xmath2 . in the former case only the spin reversal is possible , whereas in the latter case not only the spin is affected but also the ttqd is effectively `` rotated '' either clockwise or anti - clockwise ( see fig .",
    "[ figtqd ] ) .",
    "discrete rotation in real space and continuous rotation in spin space may be described in terms of group theory .",
    "the group @xmath3 characterizes the symmetry of triangle , and the group @xmath4 describes the symmetry of spin 1/2 .",
    "so the total symmetry of ttqd is determined by direct product of these two groups .",
    "one may use an equivalent language of permutation group @xmath5 for description of configuration of ttqd with an electron occupying one of three possible positions in its wells .     and @xmath6 , respectively.,width=491,height=377 ]",
    "a symmetric ttqd in a contact with source and drain leads ( fig .",
    "[ figtqd ] ) is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 the first term @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the isolated tqd , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spin index , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are intra - dot and inter - dot coulomb blockade parameters , @xmath14 are inter - dot tunneling parameters .",
    "the second term @xmath15 describes the electrons in the source @xmath16 and drain @xmath17 electrodes , @xmath18 the last term @xmath19 is the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath20 which describes a configuration with two - channel tunneling between the ttqd and the source and single - channel tunneling between the ttqd and the drain .",
    "if all three channels are equivalent , @xmath21 the tunnel contacts preserve the rotation / permutation symmetry of ttqd .",
    "if all tunnel constants are different , this symmetry is completely destroyed by tunneling . in the intermediate case @xmath22",
    "the system preserves one mirror reflection axis @xmath23 .",
    "the kondo tunneling regime will be analyzed both in cases ( [ onechan ] ) and ( [ oneax ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath24 ( [ h - sys ] ) is easily diagonalized by using the following set of basis functions @xmath25 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions of symmetric ttqd in this basis are @xmath26 with @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are two irreducible representations of the group @xmath3 the spin states with @xmath30 are spin doublets ( @xmath31 ) , so the hamiltonian of isolated ttqd in this charge sector has six eigenstates @xmath32 .",
    "the single electron energies are @xmath33 first of these energy levels is a conventional spin doublet with fully symmetrical `` orbital '' wave function @xmath34 .",
    "the second one is doubly degenerate both in spin and orbital quantum number .",
    "a peculiar feature of the three - site configuration is an _",
    "explicit dependence of the order of levels _ in spin multiplet on the sign of tunnel integral @xmath35 .",
    "the ground state is a spin doublet @xmath36 , provided @xmath37 . in case of @xmath38",
    "the lowest level is the orbital doublet @xmath39 .",
    "the orbital degeneracy of the states @xmath40 is a manifestation of rotation / permutation degrees of freedom of ttqd illustrated by fig .",
    "these discrete rotations are explicitly involved in kondo tunneling .",
    "a contact between symmetric ttqd and leads in the two - terminal geometry preserves rotation symmetry @xmath41 unless the tunnel hamiltonian @xmath19 has lower symmetry than ttqd . in any case",
    "it is useful to re - expand the tunnel hamiltonian in partial waves , which respect the `` point symmetry '' of the hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "such ansatz is known in the theory of kondo effect in 3d metal , where the spherical partial wave representation for bloch electrons in conduction band was introduced in ref .",
    "later on , this approach was extended by many authors to the case of point crystal group representation ( see , e.g. , the review [ ] ) . here",
    "we also meet the situation where the triangular quantum dot imposes its point symmetry on the continuum of electron states in the leads under certain conditions .",
    "if the condition ( [ onechan ] ) is satisfied , the point symmetry of the device as a whole is still @xmath3 , and the band states may be re - expanded as @xmath42 which has the same angular dependence as ( [ a1 ] ) .",

    "like in the singly occupied ttqd , the level ordering is sensitive to the sign of tunnel integral @xmath35 .",
    "the tunnel matrix elements are redefined accordingly .",
    "@xmath57 the matrix elements intermixing the charge sectors @xmath58 , add conduction electron @xmath59 to the dot electron @xmath60 , and the resulting two - electron states @xmath61 arise in accordance with clebsch - gordan coefficients both in spin and orbital subspaces @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "we describe kondo tunneling by means of haldane - anderson renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite . according to this procedure the parameters of the original hamiltonian",
    "are renormalized in the course of rescaling of the energy @xmath65 characterizing the width of conduction electron continuum in the leads from original value @xmath66 to the energy @xmath67 , which characterizes kondo correlations .",
    "the latter is found from the solution of scaling equations .",
    "first , the energy levels @xmath68 are renormalized by the virtual excitations of the states @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "the flow equations have the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the tunneling rate , @xmath71 is the density of electron states in the leads .",
    "this scaling ends at @xmath72 , with @xmath73 defined as @xmath74 ( schrieffer - wolff limit ) @xcite .",
    "besides , the haldane - anderson procedure generates effective two - particle vertices @xmath75 , which describe effective exchange interaction between dot and lead electrons .",
    "various cotunneling processes contribute to this interaction . in conventional kondo problem",
    "the effective low - energy exchange hamiltonian has the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the spin operators for dot and lead electrons , respectively @xcite .",
    "here we are in a position , where the low - energy states of the quantum dot are represented by a multiplet containing both spin and orbital indices . in this case",
    "the form of effective hamiltonian is predetermined by a _ dynamical symmetry _ of the hamiltonian @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the dynamical symmetry group of a given hamiltonian is determined not only by the operators , which leave this hamiltonian invariant but also by the operators describing transitions between different energy levels of the multiplet .",
    "it follows from this definition that the dynamical symmetry may vary depending on the set of energy levels which fall into an actual energy interval .",
    "in particular , it changes in the process of rescaling the energy interval in the anderson s rg procedure @xcite .",
    "if the condition @xmath79 is satisfied , then the dynamical symmetry is determined by the whole multiplet @xmath68 .",
    "the dynamical symmetry group , which describes all possible transitions within the set @xmath80 is @xmath81 . among 35 generators of this group",
    "are nine spin vectors @xmath82 with projections defined as @xmath83 the rest 8 operators describe the permutation degrees of freedom of ttqd . in the process of further reduction of the energy scale @xmath65 the highest of two levels @xmath68 is quenched , and eventual symmetry of kondo effect depends on the sign of tunneling amplitude @xmath35 .    in case of @xmath37 the permutation degrees of freedom are quenched at low - energy scale .",
    "the only vector , which is involved in the kondo cotunneling through ttqd is the spin @xmath84 defined in eq .",
    "( [ spinrho ] ) .",
    "the lead states are still classified in accordance with the point symmetry of the system . as a result",
    "the sw hamiltonian has the form @xmath85 ( the subindex @xmath86 of spin operator of tqd is omitted ) . the exchange vertices @xmath87 are @xmath88 the constant @xmath89 has antiferromagnetic sign like in conventional sw case , whereas the constant @xmath90 is negative due to the inequality @xmath91 .",
    "formally , the hamiltonian ( [ swa ] ) describes three - channel cotunneling.@xcite however , two of three available exchange channels in the hamiltonian ( [ swa ] ) are irrelevant for kondo cotunneling , because the coupling constant @xmath90 is negative ( ferromagnetic ) . as a result",
    "the conventional kondo regime arises in @xmath92 channel with kondo temperature @xmath93 where @xmath71 is the density of electron states in the leads , which is assumed to be the same for all channels . in case of @xmath38 the doublet @xmath94",
    "is quenched at @xmath95 , and the kondo effect is defined by the tunneling through ttqd in the state @xmath96 whose symmetry is @xmath97 .",
    "similar situation was observed for a double quantum dot in series geometry .",
    "@xcite in that case the pseudospin variable describes two possible occupations of an electron in a double dot .",
    "the 15 generators of this group bunch in four spin vectors @xmath98 with @xmath99 and one pseudospin vector @xmath100 defined as @xmath101 here the indices @xmath102 stand for `` orbital '' indices @xmath103 for the sake of brevity .    due to high degeneracy of the ground state of ttqd",
    ", the effective sw hamiltonian acquires quite complicated form , @xmath104 where @xmath105 and the coupling constants @xmath106 are @xmath107    both spin and `` orbital '' degrees of freedom of ttqd are involved in effective kondo tunneling .",
    "the indirect exchange coupling constants arise as combinations of cotunneling processes with virtual excitation of states with zero and two electrons .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the rotation @xmath3 symmetry in a system dot+leads may be violated in the process of cotunneling unlike the rotation spin symmetry [ see the terms @xmath108 in the hamiltonian ( [ swe ] ) ] .",
    "some of these constants are positive @xmath109 like in conventional sw transformation , and some are negative @xmath110 .",
    "thus the kondo effect arises as a result of interplay of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange involving both spin and pseudospin variables .",
    "this interplay is described by scaling equations obtained in a framework of anderson s `` poor man scaling '' procedure @xcite .",
    "the system of scaling equations describes the flow of exchange vertices , with reducing the energy scale @xmath111 from the boundary value @xmath112 to the kondo temperature @xmath67 .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath113 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{dj_2}{dt } & = &   -\\left[j_2 ^ 2+\\frac{j_4 ^ 2}{2}-j_4j_6+\\frac{j_5 ^ 2}{2}\\right ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "analysis of solutions of the scaling equations ( [ scal ] ) with initial values of coupling parameters listed in eq .",
    "( [ j - e ] ) , shows that the symmetry - breaking vertices @xmath116 are irrelevant , and the vertex @xmath117 , which is negative at the boundary @xmath118 evolves into positive domain and eventually enters the kondo temperature .",
    "the latter is given by the following equation @xmath119 we see from this equation that both spin and pseudospin coupling contribute to the kondo cotunneling on equal footing , so that @xmath67 is enhanced due to involvement of additional degrees of freedom connected with electron permutations in a triangle .",
    "the tunnel contact reduces the symmetry of ttqd when the conditions ( [ oneax ] ) are satisfied . in this case the double orbital degeneracy of the level @xmath39 is removed by tunnel coupling .",
    "then the generic symmetry of ttqd is usual @xmath4 symmetry , but an accidental degeneracy between the levels @xmath120 and @xmath36 arises under certain condition , and in this case the @xmath97 symmetry is restored .",
    "this situation as well as the properties of ttqd with @xmath121 will be considered in more detailed forthcoming publication .",
    "dynamical symmetry is a universal tool , which allows to derive the effective spin hamiltonians describing low - energy cotunneling with spin reversal through composite quantum dots .",
    "these dots possess both the continuous rotation symmetry in spin space and discrete rotation symmetry in real space .",
    "we considered in this paper the relatively simple example of symmetric triangular quantum dot in contact with metallic leads in a specific geometry where the dot imposes its discrete rotation symmetry on the electrons in the leads .",
