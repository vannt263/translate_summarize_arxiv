    "the rest of the analysis is identical with that carried out for euclidean and deterministic fractal lattices @xcite save for the change of the euclidean parameters to their chemical analogues .",
    "the result for @xmath0 is , consequently , @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 here @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the euler constant , and @xmath83 .",

    "we finish this section by showing how to find the full main term of eq .",
    "( [ snt ] ) and even predict the form of the corrective terms by only resorting to extremely simple arguments .",
    "the ideas of the following reasoning were already used in ref .",
    "the crucial point in our argument is that , for a fixed time @xmath1 , @xmath85^n $ ] approaches a unit step function @xmath86 when @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the step s width ( see fig .",

    "the reason for this behavior is clear : for large @xmath2 , @xmath89^n$ ] is only non - neglible when @xmath72 is very close to 1 .",

    "( [ snt ] ) . finally , notice that",
    "this simple method is not limited to disordered media but that it is also valid for estimating @xmath0 for the non - disordered substrates ( euclidean and deterministic fractal media ) considered in refs .",
    "we have carried out simulations for the number of distinct sites visited by @xmath2 independent random walkers on a typical stochastic fractal : the percolation aggregate embedded in two dimensions . in our simulations every random walker makes a jump from a site to one of its nearest neighbors placed at one unit distance in each unit time .",
    "the incipient percolation aggregates were constructed by the standard leath method @xcite on a square lattice with side @xmath108 . in the leath method ,",
    "a seed is placed on the site in the center of this box and the cluster is generated by epidemic spreading to their nearest neighbors with an infecting probability @xmath109 @xcite corresponding to site percolation in the square lattice . at every step of the generation process a new chemical shell is added to the previous shell by the occupation with probability @xmath11 of its empty nearest neighbors .",
    "the process continues until we reach a shell whose sites do not infect any of their empty neighbors ; in this case the aggregate so generated is rejected . if the cluster grown in this way spans the box from a side to the other , the cluster is accepted as a good representation of a portion of an infinite percolation aggregate .",

    "moreover , we must confirm first that , for a given chemical distance @xmath8 , the distribution of @xmath111 over different realizations of the incipient percolation cluster is narrow because our theoretical analysis [ cf .",
    "( [ sgsc2ell ] ) ] relies on this assumption [ cf .",

    "the striking contrast between the two histograms in fig .",

    "this is a consequence of the stochastic lacunarity of the fractal aggregate .",
    "a large hole between the origin and the trap implies a large minimum time to travel around the border of that hole and , obviously , a small mortality in comparison with another cluster where no holes hinder the diffusion .",
    "figure [ figeire ] shows the chemical mean - square displacement @xmath127 as a function of time .",
    "the propagator in the chemical space @xmath43 is obtained by summing @xmath112 over all cluster sites @xmath113 on the chemical shell situated at distance @xmath8 from the origin .",

    "<S> the average number @xmath0 of distinct sites visited up to time @xmath1 by @xmath2 noninteracting random walkers all starting from the same origin in a disordered fractal is considered . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity @xmath0 is the result of a double average : an average over random walks on a given lattice followed by an average over different realizations of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we show for two - dimensional percolation clusters at criticality ( and conjecture for other stochastic fractals ) that the distribution of the survival probability over these realizations is very broad in euclidean space but very narrow in the chemical or topological space . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to adapt the formalism developed for euclidean and deterministic fractal lattices to the chemical language , and an asymptotic series for @xmath0 analogous to that found for the non - disordered media is proposed here . </S>",
    "<S> the main term is equal to the number of sites ( volume ) inside a `` hypersphere '' in the chemical space of radius @xmath3^{1/v}$ ] where @xmath4 is the root - mean - square chemical displacement of a single random walker , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 determine how fast @xmath7 ( the probability that a given site at chemical distance @xmath8 from the origin is visited by a single random walker by time @xmath1 ) decays for large values of @xmath9 : @xmath10 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters appearing in the first two asymptotic terms of @xmath0 are estimated by numerical simulation for the two - dimensional percolation cluster at criticality . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding theoretical predictions are compared with simulation data , and the agreement is found to be very good . </S>"
