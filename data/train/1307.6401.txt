    "the higgs mechanism has intrigued both theorists and experimentalists for a long time , being one of the central pieces in the construction of the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) was indeed built to discover the missing pieces of the sm and to search for new particles beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments announced last year the discovery of a higgs particle compatible with the sm expectations with a mass of about 126 gev @xcite , and updated results with more data have been recently released ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "as we increase the energy scale above the electro - weak ( ew ) scale , the quartic couplings may become smaller and eventually become negative , where as a consequence , the potential becomes unbounded from below and the ew vacuum becomes unstable . in the context of the sm",
    "this problem was investigated a long time ago ( see for example @xcite ) and continuously reinvestigated till recently ( see for example @xcite ) as higgs data and more precise calculations became available .",
    "this is also relevant for bsm and in particular those we shall consider in the following , as this can give bounds on the limit of validity of the effective theory . among the models which explore new physics that may operate near the tev scale , those with extra spatial dimensions @xcite open many possibilities for model building which can be constrained @xcite or explored in the near future . in this context",
    "there have been many attempts to understand the origin of masses and their mixings by using the renormalisation group equations ( rges ) particularly for the universal extra dimension ( ued ) models and their possible extensions ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . in this case the problem of vacuum stability and the triviality of the higgs potential can be quite relevant as running effects are more pronounced in these models ( with respect to the sm ) .",
    "for some recent work concerning 5 and 6-dimensional ued models see @xcite .    in particular , different models with two extra - dimensions",
    "have been proposed , such as @xmath0 @xcite , the chiral square @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , the flat real projective plane @xmath4 @xcite , and the real projective plane starting from the sphere @xcite . for example , in @xcite , the parity assuring the stability of the dark matter candidate is due to a remnant of the 6-dimensional lorentz symmetry after compactification , as the model has no fixed points ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "there are many reasons to study ued models with 2 compact extra dimensions ; primarily as they may provide a dark matter candidate , suppress the proton decay rate , as well as providing anomaly cancellations for the number of light chiral fermion generations being a multiple of three @xcite .    another important point connected to bsm physics ,",
    "is that in the sm the neutrino does not have a mass , but neutrino oscillations suggest that neutrinos have finite mass and lepton flavours mix . the most recent evidence is the measurement of a large @xmath5 mixing parameter @xcite . in the context of ued models",
    "@xcite , one can use the dimension - five weinberg operator @xcite to give majorana masses to neutrinos and study rges for the physical observables in this sector .",
    "in general two extra dimensional models have different ( and faster ) evolution properties with respect to one extra dimensional models .",
    "it is therefore interesting to check if signs of the evolution of neutrino parameters are within experimental reach or not .    in section [ sec : quartic ]",
    "we introduce the higgs quartic coupling rges and compare the limits on the effective theory obtained by requiring the stability of the higgs potential with other effective rules for the cutoff theory , obtained from other requirements such as perturbativity of the interactions , gauge coupling unification , unitarity . in section",
    "[ sec : neutrino ] we shall study the neutrino mixing and masses evolution and compare them with the quark sector rges discussed in @xcite .",
    "our conclusions will be given in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we study a generic model with two universal extra dimensions , where in the following we summarise the evolution equations .",
    "we shall use a notation similar to the ones of @xcite , noting that the beta functions contain terms quadratic in the cut - off , where this part dominates the evolution of the yukawa couplings and of @xmath6 ( the coefficient of the weinberg operator ) .",
    "the top yukawa coupling becomes non - perturbative only after the gauge coupling unification . as such",
    ", the limit on the range of validity for the effective theory will be determined by which condition is reached first : unification of the gauge couplings or instability of the higgs potential .",

    "<S> two compact universal extra dimensional models are an interesting class of models for different theoretical and phenomenological issues , such as the justification of having three standard model fermion families , suppression of proton decay rate , dark matter parity from relics of the 6-dimensional lorentz symmetry , origin of masses and mixings in the standard model </S>",
    "<S> . however , these theories are merely effective ones , with typically a reduced range of validity in their energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> we explore two limiting cases of the three standard model generations all propagating in the bulk or all localised to a brane , from the point of view of renormalisation group equation evolutions for the higgs sector and for the neutrino sector of these models . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental results of the higgs boson from the lhc allow , in some scenarios , stronger constraints on the cut - off scale to be placed , from the requirement of the stability of the higgs potential . </S>"
