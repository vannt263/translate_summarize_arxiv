    "understanding the properties displayed by the entanglement of physical systems is one of the fundamental purposes of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "a quantum system composed of two or more entangled subsystems has the interesting property that although the state of the total system can be well defined , it is impossible to identify individual properties for each one of its parts .",
    "a subject that has attracted recent interest is linked to the relationship between entanglement and certain physical properties of many body quantum systems ; this has taken special interest in relation to quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite .",
    "a qpt in a many body system strongly influences the behaviour of the system near to the critical point , with the consequent appearance of long - range correlations in the ground state .",
    "although several proposals exist , currently there is no complete theory of multipartite entanglement , and the common techniques are based on bipartite decompositions of the total system .",
    "this type of decomposition has made it possible to study the entanglement in the dicke model in thermal equilibrium @xcite . here , we study the entanglement properties of a many - body system in the non - equilibrium regime , in which the total system has a unitary dynamics but is not an isolated system . for this purpose",
    "we study the single mode  externally - driven \" dicke hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are collective atomic operators , @xmath3 is the level splitting of the atoms , @xmath4 is the frecuency of the bosonic mode and @xmath5 is the time dependent atom - field coupling .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is a fraction of the static coupling @xmath7 .",
    "an exact diagonalisation of the problem eq . has been previously carried out by means of the holstein - primakoff transformation for the case of a _",
    "static _ atom - field coupling @xmath8 @xcite , but there is no known solution for the time dependent atom - field coupling case .",
    "when studying a composed quantum system whose dynamics is unitary , it is interesting to study the dynamics of the parts of the system .",
    "in contrast to the dynamics of the whole system , the dynamics of the subsystems is not unitary .",
    "however , it is possible to make a description of the subsystem through the reduced density operator .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the single mode  externally - driven \" dicke hamiltonian has an exact solution when the field is in resonance with the atoms @xmath9 . with the purpose of formulating the exact solution",
    ", we introduce an abstract coordinate representation through the coordinates of the physical field @xmath10 and the atoms coordinate @xmath11 . in terms of these coordinates , the ground state of the universe ( atoms+field )",
    "is given by the expression @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the time dependent phase is given by @xmath14 it is interesting to note that the dynamics of the system is influenced by the dynamics of the auxiliary parameters @xmath15 , which are solutions of the mathieu equation @xcite @xmath16b^{\\mp}(t)=0,\\ ] ] subject to the wronskian condition @xmath17 we describe the dynamics of the total system in terms of the density operator , where the pure state of the universe is represented by the operator @xmath18 . in the coordinate representation ,",
    "the density matrix takes the form @xmath19 we establish a bipartite decomposition of the universe and study the reduced dynamics of the atoms through their reduced density matrix ( rdm ) . in so doing ,",
    "we calculate the partial trace over the physical field coordinate @xmath10 , @xmath20 the ground state of the universe @xmath21 given in eq .",
    "is gaussian , which facilitates the integration of eq . .",
    "after some algebraic calculations , we obtain the following result for the reduced density matrix @xmath22^{2}}{4(\\re e ( \\xi^{-})c^{2}+\\re e ( \\xi^{+})s^{2})}\\right)\\times\\nonumber \\\\&&\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^{2}}{2}[(\\xi^{-})^{\\ast}s^{2}+(\\xi^{+})^{\\ast}c^{2}]\\right ) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y')^{2}}{2}[(\\xi^{-})s^{2}+(\\xi^{+})c^{2}]\\right ) ,   \\label{rd1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the real part of the function @xmath25 . in the particular case @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 ,",
    "this function is independent of time and becomes @xmath29 .",
    "hence , our model reproduces the result previously reported in the literature for the atom s reduced density matrix for the single mode dicke model in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we consider a pure state of a composed system ( the universe ) , say system @xmath30 , represented by the density operator @xmath31 .",
    "the linear entropy for the reduced density operator @xmath32 of subsystem a is defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) denotes the trace over the subsystem a ( b ) @xcite .",
    "[ figu1 ]        this gives a measure of _ purity _ of the reduced density operator @xmath36 ( o @xmath37 ) of one part of the total system ( in the bipartite decomposition of the universe ) .",
    "if the pure state of the universe is separable , the reduced density operator of one part of the system represents a pure state and , as a result , its linear entropy must be zero . similarly ,",
    "if the pure state of the universe is a maximally entangled state @xcite , the linear entropy equals @xmath38 . in the context of our externally driven single mode dicke model , it is possible to use the linear entropy as a measure of bipartite entanglement for the atoms - field system .",
    "the linear entropy for the atoms time dependent reduced density operator , eq .",
    ", is given by @xmath39 .",
    "$ ] by using the density matrix representation of eq .",
    ", we explicitly calculate the linear entropy as @xmath40 which gives , after some algebraic calculations , the result @xmath41 where the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as @xmath45^{2}}{4(\\re e ( \\xi^{-})c^{2}+\\re e ( \\xi^{+})s^{2 } ) }   ,    \\ ;   \\beta= \\frac{c^{2}s^{2}(\\xi^{-}-\\xi^{+})^{\\ast}(\\xi^{-}-\\xi^{+})}{2(\\re e ( \\xi^{-})c^{2}+\\re e ( \\xi^{+})s^{2 } ) } , \\\\",

    "interestingly , the linear entropy exhibits a time dependence that is not determined by the global phase of the ground state wave function of the universe , eq . , but by the auxiliary dynamical parameters @xmath15 .",
    "in the particular case @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , the stability zones of eq . are known @xcite , and the study of the corresponding solutions is based on the floquet s theorem for second order differential equations with time periodic coefficients . for this , the solutions of eq .",
    "have the general form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the floquet exponent , which depends on the shape of the driving . for driving functions for which @xmath50 is complex",
    ", the solution becomes unstable . in the stable regime",
    ", @xmath50 is a real number @xcite . in figs .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) we consider the phase space representation of the trajectories of the auxiliary dynamical parameters @xmath51 . for values of @xmath7 that belong to a common stability zone ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) @xcite the solutions",
    "are bounded in the phase space . in order to establish a relationship between the stability and the entanglement dynamics",
    ", we consider the linear entropy in figs .",
    "2(a ) , and ( b ) for the values of the static coupling described above .",
    "our choice of the initial conditions for eq .",
    "implies that the system starts in thermal equilibrium , but is described by a non - separable quantum state .",
    "strikingly , the dynamics exhibits a behaviour whereby the system experiences a disentanglement process , before reaching a maximum value of entanglement , and then successive collapses and revivals .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows another interesting behaviour : when the static coupling belongs to the instability zone ( @xmath54 ) of @xmath55 , the solution @xmath56 is bounded while the solution @xmath57 is unbounded in the phase space . for this value of the static coupling , the linear entropy oscillates , before it reaches the stationary state with linear entropy @xmath58 , as shown in fig .",
    "in @xcite we discuss the relationship between the stability zones and the localization of the ground state wave function of the universe . in order to study this relation ,",
    "we define the characteristic length @xmath59 , which is bounded in the stable zones and unbounded in the unstable zones .",
    "the numerical simulations of the ground state probability density show that for values of the static coupling that belong to the common stability zones the probability is localized in the abstract @xmath60 space and presents an oscillatory behaviour . in contrast , for values of the static coupling that belong to the unstable zones , the probability density has an oscillatory behaviour .",
    "however , when the system evolves , the probability density is systematically stretched in a fixed direction , with a consequent dilation in the perpendicular direction .",
    "we have obtained exact results for the atoms reduced density operator and the linear entropy for the externally driven dicke model , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these results allow us to study the entanglement dynamics through the auxiliary dynamical parameters .",
    "in contrast , in the dicke model in thermal equilibrium @xcite , the atoms - field entanglement does not have dynamics because the temporal dependence of the ground state of the universe is given by a global phase of the wave function . in this work ,",
    "the auxiliary dynamical parameters and its stability properties determine the entanglement dynamics of the system and the behaviour of the universe ground state wave packet .",
