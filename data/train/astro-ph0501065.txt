    "the peak luminosities and colors of type  ia supernovae ( snia ) appear to correlate well with their light curve decay rate @xcite making sneia exquisite distance indicators and powerful probes for cosmology @xcite .",
    "but the origin of the diversity seen in snia is a mystery that limits their reliability .",
    "it is well accepted that a snia occurs when a carbon - oxygen white dwarf has accreted matter from a companion star and approaches the chandrasekhar limit . at some point",
    "the pressure at the center is sufficient to ignite the co and a detonation / deflagration unbinds the star and generates a large mass of @xmath1ni which powers the visible light curve .",
    "this single - degenerate , chandrasekhar - mass scenario predicts very consistent explosion energies , indeed , the peak brightness of most snia fall in a narrow range spanning about 0.5 magnitudes in @xmath2 .",
    "there is also a fraction of snia that are significantly fainter than the typical event and these snia may represent a tail of the main distribution or come from a completely different set of progenitors .",
    "one clue to the origin of diversity in snia is that light curve shape ( _ i.e._,peak luminosity ) shows a dependence on host galaxy morphology as first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "ellipticals / s0 galaxies tend to host fast - declining ( low luminosity ) events compared with spiral hosts . as shown in figure  1 , the trend has become clearly established as more snia have been analyzed .",
    "galaxy morphology , however , is too blunt a tool to determine what causes luminosity variations .",
    "for example , ngc  2841 is classified as a sa galaxy , but has an extremely small h@xmath0 emission rate while ngc  632 is listed as an s0 galaxy but has a star burst at its core .",
    "to better define the environments of the supernovae , we have obtained integrated spectra of 57 snia host galaxies . from these spectra",
    "we determine the current star - formation rate , the current rate compared to the average rate in the past ( the scalo ` b ' parameter ) , and the metallicity for hosts with strong emission lines .",
    "the diversity in snia brightness comes from the range of @xmath1ni produced in the explosions .",
    "the carbon to oxygen ratio in the white dwarf could effect the amount of radioactive ni synthesized and this ratio can be influenced by the inital metallicity of the progenitor @xcite or the initial mass of the progenitor @xcite . in figure  2",
    "we plot the host galaxy metallicity derived from emission line ratios @xcite against the supernova light curve decay rate .",
    "the light curve shape is parameterized by @xmath3 which describes the number magnitudes the supernova fades 15 days after maximum light in the @xmath2-band .",
    "there is no significant correlation between @xmath3 and host metallicity over an order of magnitude in metal content .",
    "relying on emission lines restricts this analysis to active star - forming galaxies , so we have supplemented our data with elliptical galaxies published by @xcite .",
    "these additional data enlarge the range of @xmath3 covered , but still do not reveal any correlation with metallicity .",
    "the rate of current star formation in a galaxy is related to its h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the ratio between current star formation and the average rate in the past can be derived from the h@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "this ratio is also known as the scalo ` b ' parameter and we plot the scalo  b versus @xmath3 in figure  3 . for hosts with measurable emission lines , there is no clear correlation between the decay rate and scalo  b , but the range of snia luminosity increases as the scalo  b parameter declines .",
    "we conclude that the age of the stellar population has more of an influence over snia diversity than does host metallicity .",
    "the binary nature of the standard snia model means that the mass of the secondary controls the time - scale for mass transfer @xcite .",
    "a simplified picture of the single degenerate model is illustrated in figure  4 where stars in the binary are selected at random from a steep initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the primary is assumed to form a white dwarf after its main sequence life time and explode when the secondary evolves off the main sequence if its ejected envelope is sufficient to raise the primary white dwarf to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the steep imf means that most snia come from binaries made of two low - mass stars that take 3 to 4  gyr to explode ( as found by @xcite ) .",
    "populations older than 5  gyr will have snia binaries made of a massive primary and a low - mass secondary that takes a very long time to evolve off the main sequence . if the @xmath1ni yield is inversely correlated with the primary mass , then many of the observed properties of snia and their host galaxies are explained .",
