    "[ fig : equal ] one can see that we generally expect @xmath188 supersymmetric qcd - like corrections to the top - quark cross section .",
    "( there may also be significant electroweak - like corrections if @xmath189 . )",
    "going beyond the specific models discussed above , the light top - squarks that enhance both electroweak - like and qcd - like corrections will likely decrease the canonical top - quark branching ratio into @xmath190 because of the availability of the supersymmetric decay channels @xmath191 .",
    "indeed , the top - quark yukawa coupling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) entails an enhanced coupling between the top - quark , a higgsino - like neutralino , and a right - handed top - squark .",
    "this situation is favored by the enhanced corrections discussed above , and therefore enhance the exotic decays of the top quark . at present",
    "there are no real experimental limits on @xmath19 , only on @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "the only limits on @xmath19 have been obtained by correlating the top - quark mass and cross section measurements with the standard model cross section , implying @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "if the electroweak - like ( negative ) correction occurs when the exotic channel ( @xmath194 ) is kinematically allowed , the yield of @xmath20 events will be decreased by the two effects , implying an effective @xmath19 ratio as small as @xmath195 , assuming a @xmath0 shift in the cross section and @xmath196 .",
    "however , we note that the enhancements to the electroweak - like corrections occur right _ below _ the threshold for top - quark decay into top - squark and neutralino ( see figs .  [ fig:50100],[fig:75250 ] ) , and therefore the exotic decay channel is effectively closed .    recent complementary studies of top - quark properties in supersymmetric theories include supersymmetric one - loop corrections to the @xmath197 exotic decay channel @xcite , supersymmetric three - body decays of the top quark @xcite , and one - loop supersymmetric corrections to the top - quark width @xcite .",
    "the experimental study of the top quark has just begun in earnest , with its mass and cross section having been measured to some precision .",
    "the main injector upgrade of the tevatron should essentially provide a top - quark factory , where observations will be confronted with theoretical expectations for cross sections and branching ratios .",
    "we have shown that these precise measurements may indeed point to deviations from the standard model , as may be expected in supersymmetric theories .",
    "these deviations may be quite sizeable and therefore easy to detect , especially in scenarios with rather light sparticles that have been proposed to explain various apparent experimental anomalies . in the longer term",
    ", the presence of top quarks at the lhc will constitute one of largest backgrounds in new physics searches .",
    "therefore , it will be essential to have a very good understanding of top - quark physics beforehand , so that these backgrounds may be subtracted off appropriately .",
