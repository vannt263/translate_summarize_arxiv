    "kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in low mass x - ray neutron star ( ns ) binaries ( lmxb s ) discovered by rossi x - ray timing explorer ( strohmayer 1996 , van der klis 1996 , zhang 1996 ) made it possible to evaluate quantitatively the previously suggested beat - frequency model ( alpar & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "most of the nineteen sources with qpo have twin peaks in the khz part of the spectrum ( lower frequency marked by k and the higher one by h in the spectrum of the source sco x-1 shown in figure 1 ) . within the beat - frequency interpretation",
    ", the upper khz qpo represents the keplerian frequency ( van der klis 1996 ) while the lower khz qpo is produced by the beating of this frequency with the ns spin frequency , @xmath12 , which has been identified with the frequency of nearly coherent oscillations observed during bursts , @xmath13 or half that ( strohmayer 1996 , miller 1998 ) . according to mendez & van der klis ( 1999 ) , if this interpretation is correct , @xmath14 equals @xmath12 and should remain constant .",
    "the ns spin can not change by @xmath15 on time scales of days to months . \" for a number of sources it has been shown that @xmath16 decreases systematically with @xmath1 ( van der klis et al .",

    "these recent findings have undermined the beat - frequency model .",
    "the new ( two - oscillator ) model ( osherovich and titarchuk 1999a and titarchuk and osherovich 1999 , hereafter ot99a and to99 , respectively ) assumes that the lower frequency @xmath1 is the keplerian frequency .",
    "following titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 hereafter tlm ) , we assume a viscous transition layer in the ns disk ( see figure 1 ) which is bounded by the solid surface of the ns ( the inner boundary ) and by the first keplerian orbit ( the outer boundary ) .",
    "the adjustment of the keplerian disk to the sub - keplerian inner boundary creates conditions favorable for the formation of a hot blob at the outer boundary of the transition layer ( tlm ) . when thrown out into the magnetosphere , the blob becomes a keplerian oscillator under the influence of the coriolis force with two modes : a ) a radial mode with frequency @xmath17^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the angular velocity of the rotating magnetosphere , and b ) a mode perpendicular to the disk with frequency @xmath19 where @xmath5 is the angle between @xmath20 and the vector normal to the plane of the keplerian oscillations ( @xmath21 ) . from the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using ( 1 ) , one finds @xmath18 as a function of @xmath1 and verifies the existence of the angle @xmath5 which satisfies equation ( 2 ) for all observed @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for sco x-1",
    ", it was found that @xmath22 ( ot99a ) .",
    "the second oscillator in the two - oscillator model has the frequency of viscous oscillations @xmath7 for which the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath1 is obtained through the dimensional analysis of the radial transport of the angular momentum in the transition layer controlled by a viscous force determined by the reynold s number , which , in turn , is related to the mass accretion rate ( tlm , to99 ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath7 can be presented in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a universal function for any ns and the constant @xmath25 reflects the properties of the specific source .",
    "the diffusive process in the transition layer is characterized by a break frequency @xmath8 ( see figure 1 ) which is related to @xmath7 by a power law ( to99 ) : @xmath26 for the source 4u 1728 - 34 , the coefficient of proportionality is found to be 0.041 ( to99 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath5 , the constant @xmath25 and the profile of @xmath18 determine the frequency range of @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "some of the qpos have been described previously within the framework of the two - oscillator model ( to99 ) .",
    "for the first time , we identify all predicted frequency branches and compare the inferred main physical parameters for two stars ( section 2 , 3 and 4 ) . in section 5 , we extend the comparison of the theoretical relation ( 4 ) with observed spectra from other atoll sources and z - sources .",
    "the summary and discussion are presented in section 6 .",
    "the frequencies of the observed qpos for sco x-1 are plotted in figure 2 as a function of @xmath1 . from the observed @xmath0 ( upper hybrid frequency marked by asterisks in figure 2 ) and @xmath1 ,",
    "the profile of @xmath27 has been calculated and modeled using the theoretically inferred magnetic multipole structure of the differentially rotating magnetosphere ( ot99a ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath18 profile is @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the constants @xmath30 hz , @xmath31 hz@xmath32 , @xmath33 hz@xmath34 and @xmath35 hz@xmath36 have been obtained by the least - squares fit with @xmath37 ( ot99a ) .",
    "using equation ( 5 ) for @xmath18 , from formula ( 2 ) we have calculated @xmath3 for different @xmath5 .",
    "the best fit to the data presented by open circles in figure 2 has been found for @xmath38 .",
    "the second harmonic of the low branch , @xmath39 hz observed by van der klis 1997 has been also fitted by our theoretical curve in figure 2 .",
    "we employ the distance determination in the function lebesgue s space , @xmath40 ( e.g. korn & korn , 1961 , ",
    "15.2.2 ) defining the relative lebesgue s measure @xmath41 as a root of the ratio of the sum of the square difference ( between the theoretical and observational values ) and the sum of square of the theoretical values . presumably @xmath41 is a better measure of the difference between observations and theory than the @xmath42 criteria in the case of the actual large uncertainty in determining the qpos and break frequencies . this uncertainty is likely significantly larger than statistical errors because the low frequency features are broad and lie atop continuum noise of unknown shape .",
    "if the data set is not uniform for the better control one can use the second measure : the rms deviation , @xmath43 which is defined as a ratio of the rms and the mean value of the frequency range , ( cf .",
    "bendat & piersol 1971 ) . typically @xmath44 ; for @xmath3 in fig . 2 @xmath454.6% .",
    "the frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath46 are marked as hbo in the original spectra for sco x-1 qpos presented by wijnands & van der klis 1999 ( figure 3 in their paper ) . in the same figure , the break frequency was marked ( with question mark ) and also an extra noise component was shown ( @xmath7 in our interpretation ) .",
    "we have also analyzed the archival data obtained by the rxte observatory in the course of sco x-1 monitoring on may 25 - 28 , 1996 .",
    "standard tasks from ftools v4.2 were used in our data analysis according to the rxte cook book . to obtain a broad band power density spectra ( pds ) ,",
    "the original 1/8192 s data were regrouped in 32 s segments with 1/4096 s time resolution data and each spectrum was calculated over a continuous time interval with a constant offset . the pds obtained were fit over the whole range ( 1/32  2048 hz ) using the king and lorentzian profiles .",
    "the lorentzian components were added to the model when their statistical significance was higher than @xmath47 . in order to characterize the break in each pds , we assume such a break frequency \" @xmath48 ,",
    "at which the power drops to 50% of the low frequency plateau value ( in terms of the king model ) . our confidence in the identification of @xmath8 and @xmath7 ( figs . 1 - 2 ) for sco x-1",
    "is based on two tests .",
    "firstly , the observations for the two branches in the lower part of the spectra satisfy our theoretical relation ( 4 ) , namely , @xmath49 . as a second test",
    ", we use the verification that the extra noise component has a frequency which satisfies the theoretically derived dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath1 . in formula",
    "( 3 ) , the universal function @xmath24 obtained numerically from a solution for radial viscous oscillations at the outer edge of the transition region , in fact , can be approximated by a polynomial @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52hz@xmath53 , @xmath54hz@xmath55 and @xmath56hz@xmath36 .",
    "the best fit for @xmath7 ( @xmath57% ) presented in figure 2 by a solid line ( marked viscous ) is found for @xmath58 .",
    "the line for the related @xmath8 with the observational points ( marked by filled circles ) closely matching the theory ( @xmath59% ) is also shown in figure 2 .",
    "notice that in vicinity of @xmath60800 hz the line for @xmath7 crosses the line for @xmath3 suggesting the possibility of interactions of two oscillators .",
    "the classification of qpos in the source 4u 1728 - 34 is presented in figure 3 .",
    "the profile of @xmath61 has been modelled using observations for @xmath0 ( mendez & van der klis 1999 ) and formula ( 5 ) with constants @xmath62 hz , @xmath63 hz@xmath32 , @xmath64 hz@xmath34 and @xmath65hz@xmath36 for @xmath66 ( ot99a ) .",
    "a survey of the observed qpo frequencies in the source 4u 1728 - 34 was presented in ford & van der klis 1998 , ( hereafter fvk ) .",
    "the 100 hz lorentzian frequency ( presented in the table 1 there ) we identify with @xmath46 .",
    "the best fit is found for @xmath9 using the extrapolation of @xmath27 into the range for @xmath1 below 550 hz and also observed @xmath3 for @xmath67 hz .",
    "the previously identified @xmath7 ( to99 ) corresponds to the lf lorentzian frequency in the above mentioned table 1 of fvk and @xmath8 corresponds to the broken pl break frequency for three days march 1 , february 24 and february 18 .",
    "the data for february 16 , as explained in fvk and to99 have to be treated separately ( the observed @xmath68 hz oscillation does not belong to the @xmath8 branch ) .",
    "for this source , the constant @xmath25 is found to be equal to 7.1 . in comparison with the sco x-1 classification ( figure 2 ) , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 branches for the source 4u 1728 - 34 have a much wider range and therefore are verified with greater confidence : @xmath69% for @xmath70 and @xmath71% for @xmath8 .. the branches @xmath3 and @xmath46 are not observed simultaneously , but still match the theoretical curves ( @xmath72% for @xmath3 ) .      due to the slightly higher @xmath0 for source 4u 1728 - 34 ,",
    "the resulting @xmath18 profile has a higher frequency than the @xmath18 profile for sco x-1 . for sco x-1 , @xmath73 hz , while for source 4u 1728 - 34 , @xmath74 415 hz .",
    "but even more important for the values of @xmath75 is the difference in @xmath5 between the two stars . for the source 4u 1728 - 34 , @xmath9 and the @xmath46 branch in figure 3 changes from 124 hz ( @xmath76 hz ) to 182 hz ( @xmath77 hz ) .",
    "the same @xmath46 branch for sco x-1 stays below 100 hz for all observed @xmath1 due to the smaller @xmath22 and the smaller @xmath18 [ see formula ( 2 ) ] .",
    "on the other hand , for sco x-1 the constant @xmath58 is greater than @xmath78 for source 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "therefore , the frequency of viscous oscillations @xmath7 and the related @xmath8 are higher for sco x-1 for the same @xmath1 , as shown in figures 2 and 3 . for the same reynold s number , the greater",
    "@xmath25 implies a higher viscosity ( to99 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath7 has been approximated by a power law ( 4 ) ( to99 ) .",
    "recent observations of wijnands & van der klis ( 1999 ) make it possible to verify formula ( 4 ) for a number of atoll sources and z - sources . in figure 4 ,",
    "the observed @xmath8 are plotted vs. @xmath7 on a log - log scale .",
    "the open circles correspond to z - sources and asterisks represent data for atoll sources .",
    "the straight theoretical line confirms that the power law @xmath79 is correct for atoll sources .",
    "when @xmath8 is multiplied by a factor of 4 , data for z - sources match the same straight line ( closed circles represent @xmath80 for z - sources in figure 4 ) .",
    "thus for z - sources @xmath81 it is conceivable that the factor of 4 difference in the proportionality constant is due to the dominant role of different eigenmodes of the diffusive process for z - sources in comparison with atoll sources .",
    "if this is the case , then relation ( 7 ) corresponds to the first mode and formula ( 4 ) represents the second mode of break frequency ( see e.g. titarchuk 1994 for the details of the diffusion theory ) . in general , the diffusion equation suggests @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the integer number of the corresponding eigenmode .",
    "the overall @xmath41 including the z - sources reduced points ( closed circles ) is 27% .      in this _",
    "letter _ we have identified all predicted frequency branches for two stars .",
    "their frequencies are compared favorably with the two - oscillator model . for the source 4u 1728 - 34 , the angle @xmath5",
    "is found ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is the third star for which @xmath5 has been inferred from qpo observations . for sco x-1 , @xmath22 ( ot99a ) and for source 4u 1702 - 42 , @xmath84 ( osherovich & titarchuk 1999b ) .",
    "the predicted relation ( 4 ) has been confirmed for sco x-1 and source 4u 1728 - 34 and also for a number of other atoll and z - sources .",
    "the difference by a factor of 4 between the value of @xmath8 for two groups of stars suggests the participation of two modes in the diffusive process in the viscous transition layer in the disk . by comparison sco",
    "x-1 has greater viscosity in the transition layer than the source 4u1728 - 34 , assuming the same reynold s number .",
    "we stress the identification of the lowest of the twin khz frequencies @xmath1 as a keplerian frequency in contrast to the previous views .",
    "the solutions for @xmath85 and @xmath8 have been found by integration along the radius @xmath86 .",
    "the conversion of the resulting profiles into the frequency domain is done in according to the formula for the keplerian frequency @xmath1 ( e.g. to99 , eq.1 ) .",
    "the same is true for the modelling of the @xmath18 profile .",
    "the resulting striking correspondence between the observed spectra of qpo ( figures 2 and 3 ) and the predictions of the two - oscillator model we view as confirmation of the correct identification .",
    "an extrapolation of @xmath87profile is not expected to be accurate as the data are insufficient to allow a reliable estimate of the ns spin frequency .",
    "the complexity of the qpo phenomena still leaves unsolved problems such as @xmath88hz and @xmath89hz qpo phenomena .",
