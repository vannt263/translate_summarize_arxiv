    "when analyzing the distribution of original inverse semi - major axes of long - period comets , concluded that the near - parabolic spike of this distribution reveals a distant reservoir of comets ( the ` oort cloud ' ) .",
    "his favoured mechanism of injection of comets from this reservoir into observable orbits ( , with small perihelion distances ) was the passage of stars in the vicinity of the reservoir , whereby the long - term reshuffling of angular momenta would ensure a continuous infeed into the innermost part of the solar system .    until the 1980 s stellar perturbation was the only mechanism considered , when issues concerning the injection of comets from the oort cloud were discussed ( , ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "however , by that time it became clear that the tidal action of the galaxy as a whole must also have an important influence  especially the part corresponding to the @xmath5-dependent disk potential @xcite .",
    "this was verified by noting that the galactic latitudes of perihelia of new oort cloud comets have a double - peaked distribution that is characteristic of the disk tide @xcite .",
    "an important paper by treated the formation of the oort cloud and showed that the characteristic time scale for changing the perihelion distances , independent of the semi - major axis , is shorter for the galactic disk tide than for the stellar perturbations .",
    "this has been verified by later analytic work , , by , and further numerical simulations of oort cloud evolution ( , ) have given support to the dominance of galactic tides for comet injection .",
    "consequently , stellar perturbations have come to be practically neglected as a source of comet injection  except when discussing `` comet showers '' @xcite arising from rare stellar passages through the dense , inner parts of the oort cloud .",
    "the importance of stellar perturbations for randomizing the orbital distribution of the oort cloud and thus keeping the relevant infeed trajectories of the disk tide populated over long time scales has been realized ( see and references therein ) , but the actual injection is often seen as due only to the tide . hence it should be limited to semi - major axes large enough for the tidal perturbation to bring the cometary perihelion at once from outside the `` jupiter - saturn barrier '' ( , perihelion distance @xmath6  au ) into the observable region ( @xmath1  au ) .",
    "the result is that one expects new comets to have @xmath7  au @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "some recent papers indicate that this picture may have problems .",
    "the fractional population of the observable region  if fed only by galactic tides  is small enough , and the orbital periods long enough , that the estimated total population of the oort cloud may be uncomfortably large @xcite . and",
    "in addition , when non - gravitational effects are included into orbit determinations for new oort cloud comets @xcite , the resulting original orbits tend to be of shorter periods , having smaller semi - major axes  often much smaller than @xmath8  au .",
    "meanwhile , we have developed fast and accurate methods to treat both the galactic tides @xcite and stellar perturbations @xcite in monte carlo simulations of oort cloud dynamics .",
    "this has allowed us to perform calculations , to be presented here , where the cloud is represented by as many as @xmath9 sample comets and integrated over a time exceeding the age of the solar system .",
    "this amounts to @xmath10 comet - years of individual evolutions ( or only slightly smaller due to the loss of comets during the simulation ) , which is much more than in all previous long - term oort cloud simulations  , @xmath11 comet - years for , @xmath12 comet - years for , and @xmath13 comet - years for who used cloning .",
    "simulated @xmath14 comet - years but only thanks to extensive cloning during the course of the simulation .",
    "in fact her long - term simulations ( 4.5  gyr ) concerned only @xmath15 `` tokens '' , , comets actually followed , while these were meant to represent @xmath16 times as many comets by means of cloning .",
    "our work is the first to study the mechanism of injection of comets from the oort cloud over the age of the solar system by simulating and comparing different dynamical models .",
    "the reason why models involving both the galactic tide and stellar perturbations gave a much higher flux of injected comets than those involving only stars @xcite was never clarified , since comparisons with models involving only the tide were not made . in the present paper we concentrate on a comprehensive comparison of combined and separate models , thus describing and analyzing for the first time the synergy effect of galactic tide and stars .",
    "we also take special care to define correctly the encounter velocities in our sample of passing stars , thereby arriving at somewhat larger values than those used previously . finally , we study the relative filling of the observable part of the loss cone and the distribution of inverse semi - major axes of the injected comets .",
    "these studies are , however , only preliminary , since our current simulations do not include planetary perturbations , and thus we can not account for those comets that arrive into the observable region after having `` diffused '' across the jupiter - saturn barrier in several revolutions .",
    "our calculations are presented in sect .  2 , and in sects .",
    "35 we describe our results in terms of the distribution of injection times into the inner planetary system , the flux of new , observable comets as a function of time , and the distributions of inverse semi - major axis and galactic latitude of perihelion as well as loss cone filling at representative epochs . in sect",
    ".  6 we discuss the results and summarize our conclusions .",
    "as a simplifying assumption , we consider the oort cloud to have been formed instantaneously at a given epoch , and that its orbital distribution was isotropic to begin with .",
    "thus the initial conditions are chosen with flat distributions of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( we use common notations for the orbital elements , and the angles may be defined with respect to an arbitrary frame of reference ) .",
    "we consider a thermalized initial state of the cloud , where the semi - major axes ( @xmath21 ) are chosen in the interval @xmath22  au with a probability density @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the initial eccentricities ( @xmath24 ) are chosen with a density function @xmath25 in such a way that the perihelia are outside the planetary system ( @xmath26  au ) .",
    "we thus initialise @xmath27 comets .",
    "the galactic parameters used for calculating the tidal effects are the same as described in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "the most important one for comparison with other investigations is the mid - plane disk density , which we take as 0.1  @xmath28pc@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with , while used 0.18  @xmath28pc@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the simulation runs with a predefined set of @xmath30 stellar encounters , occurring at random times during a lapse of @xmath31  yr , with random solar impact parameters up to @xmath32  au , and with random stellar masses and velocities .",
    "our procedure for creating each of these encounters is as follows .",
    "let @xmath33 denote a stochastic , random number with a uniform probability distribution on the interval @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the solar impact parameter is chosen as @xmath35 , and the time of the encounter ( specifically , the time of the star s perihelion passage ) is @xmath36 .",
    "the direction of stellar motion with respect to the sun is defined in terms of galactic latitude and longitude ( @xmath37 ) such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , , it has an isotropic distribution .",
    "the point at which the initial stellar velocity cuts the orthogonal impact plane is situated on a circle of radius @xmath40 around the sun , and its location is defined by an azimuthal angle ( @xmath41 ) such that @xmath42 .",
    "next we choose the type of the star .",
    "we use 13 categories as in with parameters listed in table  [ tab : enc ] .",
    "to each category we associate one value of the stellar mass .",
    "these masses are generally taken as those of the archetypal spectral classes along the main sequence according to .",
    "however , in contrast to our earlier investigations , we replace the archetypal mass of 18  @xmath28 for b0 stars by a weighted average of 9  @xmath28 , considering that the less massive , later types ( b2 , b5 ) are much more common than the earlier ones .",
    "the relative encounter frequencies @xmath43 of table  [ tab : enc ] are taken from , where they were derived from the respective products of number density and mean velocity , @xmath44 .",
    "a random number @xmath45 is used to pick a stellar category @xmath46 with the probability @xmath47 .",
    ".stellar parameters .",
    "the types are mostly mk types for main sequence stars ; ` wd ' indicates white dwarfs , and ` gi ' indicates giant stars .",
    "the encounter frequencies are given in number per myr within 1 pc .",
    "the following two columns list the solar apex velocity with respect to the corresponding type , and the spherical maxwellian velocity dispersion .",
    "the last two columns give the mean heliocentric encounter velocity and its standard deviation according to our results .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     we have already made the remark that neither @xmath48 nor @xmath49 provides a fully satisfactory measure of the synergy effect , because they do not account for the difference of the number of oort cloud comets between different dynamical models  especially towards the end of the simulation .",
    "after 5  gyr the total number of comets in the combined model is only @xmath50% of that in the tides - only model , and if we concentrate on comets with @xmath51  au where the losses are the largest , the ratio of the two models is only 35% . in order to compensate for such effects",
    "we have computed the @xmath52 parameter separately for the three models and for all the ranges of @xmath53 , and we present the results in table  [ tab : flc_gsc ] .",
    "the time periods referred to are the quiescent periods of figs .",
    "[ fig : in_4.55d9 - 4.72d9 ] and [ fig : in_6.3d8 - 8d8 ] .",
    "the outermost energy range is empty in all models , when the simulation starts , but it gets populated quickly  at least when stars are involved .",
    "we interpret the very large value of @xmath52 in the tides - only model at the beginning as evidence that the radial tide has not extracted comets into this energy range in a uniform manner , so that our assumption of thermalization when deriving @xmath54 is not justified . to a lesser extent",
    "this appears to be true also in the combined model , where stars have extracted many more comets .",
    "it is likely that this extraction too  at the early time in question  has not populated all the angular momenta in a thermalized fashion .",
    "however , the statistics is too poor to be confident about such conclusions . in any case",
    ", the loss cone filling is extremely efficient for all models , thus explaining the negative values of @xmath48 .    for the next energy range",
    "we see the saturation effect again , especially in the beginning . at the end ,",
    "the value of @xmath52 in the combined model is close to the sum of those in the other two models .",
    "hence there is no apparent synergy in this case , but probably a real synergy has been concealed by the saturation effect . in any case the large negative value of @xmath48 results entirely from the small number of comets in the combined model , as discussed above . in the next three energy ranges ( @xmath55  au ) we see that @xmath52 in the combined model is much larger than the sum of the two other entries , and for @xmath56  au the effect continues : adding the tides to the stars increases the loss cone filling by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "we have simulated the evolution of the oort cloud over 5  gyr , using for initial conditions a relaxed model with a distribution of semi - major axis @xmath58 within the interval @xmath59  au .",
    "this model is based on the results of simulation of oort cloud formation and evolution by .",
    "however , we do not find this to be a steady distribution .",
    "more comets are lost from the outer parts of the cloud than can be replaced from inside , so that our model cloud evolves into a distribution close to @xmath60  , flat in @xmath53 .",
    "our dynamical model has two main limitations .",
    "we do not treat encounters with very massive galactic perturbers , such as star clusters or giant molecular cloud complexes , the justification being that they occur so rarely that the current solar system is unlikely to feel the direct reverberations of any such encounter , and that even if they modify the structure of the oort cloud , our interest is not primarily in its dynamical history but rather in the way stars and galactic tides currently interact when injecting observable comets .",
    "moreover , we do not treat planetary perturbations in any direct manner .",
    "like most previous investigators ( _ e.g. _ , ) we use a loss cone defined by a limiting perihelion distance ( in our case , 15  au ) outside which no planetary effects are included and inside which all comets are considered lost from the cloud through perturbations by jupiter and saturn . in terms of `` transparency '' of the planetary system @xcite , our model is completely opaque ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this means that we are limiting our attention to a subset of the observed population of `` new '' oort cloud comets , , those that have jumped directly from @xmath62  au into their observed orbits with @xmath63  au .",
    "we are neglecting the rest of the population , which consists of comets that passed perihelia in the outer part of the loss cone without being perturbed away before arriving into observable orbits . we are also neglecting a possible contribution to the observed new comets by a `` leakage '' from the scattered disk @xcite .",
    "therefore we prefer not to draw any conclusions in this paper regarding the total number of oort cloud comets or the exact values of the filling factors . nor",
    "do we claim to make any prediction on the detailed shape of the @xmath53 distribution of new oort cloud comets , until we have included the planetary perturbations in a realistic manner .",
    "we have shown that the concept of tidal and stellar torquing time scales @xcite gives a very incomplete picture of the speed of comet injection , whether it may concern galactic tides or stellar encounters .",
    "the distribution of injection times is largely shaped by other effects  like comet showers or the repopulation of the emptied infeed trajectories of the disk tide due to the non - integrable part of the tides or stellar perturbations .",
    "we have also shown how  for semi - major axes large enough for the tide to populate observable orbits  the regions of the phase space occupied by trajectories leading into the loss cone get depleted during the first gyr of oort cloud evolution .",
    "this would leave little chance for the tide to produce a significant number of observable comets at the current time , were it not for the capability of stellar perturbations to replenish the tidal infeed trajectories .",
    "we have indeed demonstrated that , during the later parts of our simulation , there is a very important synergy effect of the galactic tide and stellar perturbations such that the combined injection rate is on the average @xmath64% larger than that of the stars alone plus that of the tide alone .",
    "this synergy is strongest for semi - major axes between @xmath65  au but continues all the way into the inner core . during comet showers the synergy effect in the outer parts of the cloud",
    "practically disappears , but the one affecting the inner parts becomes very important .",
    "we have identified two mechanisms for the synergy during quiescent periods in the outer parts of the oort cloud .",
    "one is that the stellar perturbations provide a supply of new comets that replenishes the depleted tidal infeed trajectories , and the other is that the gain of comet injections , when stellar perturbations decrease the perihelion distance , dominates over the loss caused by opposing perturbations .",
    "for the synergy of the inner cloud we hypothesize that the galactic tides provide the material for stellar injections by slowly feeding the region of phase space in the vicinity of the loss cone .",
    "thus , the general picture spawned by our results is that injection of comets from the oort cloud is essentially to be seen as a team work involving both tides and stars .",
    "it appears meaningless to rank the two effects in terms of strength or efficiency .    indeed , for the smaller semi - major axes the galactic tide does not dominate the injection of comets , contrary to the conclusions of and .",
    "across the limiting value @xmath66  au  while we consider large jumps from @xmath62  au into the observable region with @xmath63  au .",
    "interestingly , commented that the injection into orbits with @xmath67  au and @xmath68  au is indeed dominated by stellar perturbations .",
    "] it only contributes to a synergy with stellar perturbations , and without the stars one would not have any injections of comets with @xmath69  au .",
    "the distribution of galactic latitudes of perihelia of the observable comets exhibits a maximum for @xmath70 as expected in the tides - only model , but in the combined model this feature can hardly be seen at all .",
    "the tides form part of the synergetic injection , but their imprint is largely washed out by the stellar contribution .",
    "but , likely due to the role of the tides in helping the stars to create comet showers , the pattern can be seen at least as clearly during a shower as during the quiescent periods .",
    "therefore , it tentatively appears that the shape of the observed @xmath71 distribution can not be used to indicate whether we are experiencing any shower at present .",
    "however , since none of our model distributions appears to agree with the observed one , we have to defer any conclusions to future papers .",
    "it may be interesting to see , for instance , if the leakage from the scattered disk into the oort cloud with an ensuing direct transfer into observable new comets may alleviate the problem .",
    "we have measured the filling of the observable part of the loss cone by comparing our simulated injection rates for different intervals of semi - major axis with the rates of observable perihelion passages ( @xmath63  au ) computed for a completely thermalized distribution of cometary orbits involving a filled loss cone .",
    "the deficiency of our simulated rate likely reflects not only a lack of comets in the loss cone but a general depletion in a wider phase space region in its vicinity , as remarked by .",
    "our results can be compared with hers , and in contrast to her inference that @xmath52 may level out at @xmath72% for @xmath73  au , we find an average filling factor during quiescent periods in the current solar system , which drops steadily from @xmath74% at @xmath75  au to 1% or less at @xmath56  au in the combined model .",
    "however , there are important differences between the two investigations , one being that she simulated a much shorter time period than we do , and in addition our parameters for the galactic tides and stellar encounters also differ from hers .    in agreement with , we find that cometary showers do not significantly increase the loss cone filling at large semi - major axes .",
    "however , near @xmath76  au there is an abrupt change into the regime of the inner cloud , where the filling factor increases by orders of magnitude during moderate to strong events .",
    "the showers of course involve direct injections by the passing stars , but the synergy with the galactic tide is as important as during quiescent periods .",
