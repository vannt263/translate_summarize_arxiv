    "inorganic fulminates are primary explosives and they find applications as initiators for secondary explosives .",
    "they are iso electronic with the corresponding azides , cyanates and cyanamides @xcite .",
    "silver fulminate ( agcno ) belongs to the class of inorganic fulminates , which is an effective detonator and also found to be as effective as lead azide ( pb(n@xmath3)@xmath4 ) in its pure form ( ex . 60 mg of agcno is sufficient to get maximum output from the hexahydro 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine ( rdx ) ) @xcite .",
    "it is about fifteen times as efficient as the mercury fulminate ( hg(cno)@xmath4 ) for exploding 2,4,6-tri - nitro - phenyl - methyl - nitroamine and 30% more efficient for exploding tri - nitro - xylene @xcite .",
    "it is known to be a sensitive explosive for a long time with good detonating properties @xcite , the average detonation velocity of agcno sample of thickness @xmath50.5 mm is in the order of 1700 ms@xmath6 , when ignited by a hot wire@xcite .",
    "agcno detonators has been used in the italian navy @xcite .",
    "it finds some applications ( when small quantity is used ) in pyrotechnics , fire works , and toy pistols @xcite .",
    "the decomposition mechanism of agcno is as follows : 2agcno @xmath7 2ag + 2co + n@xmath4 ; and the production of two gases co and n@xmath4 give distinct noise when it is used in christmas crackers@xcite .",
    "moreover , the initiating propeties of various fulminates were examined by martin and wohler @xcite , and they found that the ag , cd and cu fulminates have stronger initiating power than hg(cno)@xmath4 .",
    "however , hg(cno)@xmath4 stands first which is now being widely used as standard primary explosive , but it was largely replaced by pb(n@xmath3)@xmath4 @xcite due to its poor stability and toxicity .",
    "the pb(n@xmath3)@xmath4 was found to have better thermal stability and insensitive compared to the fulminates .",

    "however , it has been reported that agcno crystals stored under water about 40 years ago exhibit similar properties as like fresh crystals with an exception that the white crystals transform to mouse - gray colour due to long exposure to light and these crystals possess non hygroscopic nature @xcite .",
    "agcno was first prepared by brugnatelli @xcite ( 1798 ) and later recognised by gay - lussac @xcite ( 1824 ) . in 1959 , singh@xcite reported the crystal structure of agcno to be body centred orthorhombic structure having space group @xmath11 with lattice constants a = 3.88 @xmath12 , b = 11.20 @xmath12 and c = 6.04 @xmath12 , and z = 4 .",
    "the accuarte crystal symmetry and formation of two ploymorphic phases of agcno was first pointed out by pandey @xcite and britton @xmath13 @xcite ( 1965 ) .",
    "further , the redetermined crystal structures of the two polymorphic phases are reported as orthorhombic ( _ cmcm _ ) phase by barrick @xmath13 @xcite ( 1979 ) , with unit - cell parameters a = 3.88 @xmath12 , b = 10.752 @xmath12 and c = 5.804 @xmath12 , and z = 4 , and trigonal ( _ r@xmath0 _ ) phase by britton @xcite ( 1991 ) , a = 9.087@xmath12 , @xmath1 = 115.73@xmath14 and z = 6 . the differential thermal analysis studies @xcite indicate no evidence for temperature induced phase changes between 20@xmath9c and 145@xmath9c . to the best of our knowledge , there are no studies to explore the relative stability under pressure and temperature , electronic structure , and chemical bonding of the two polymorphic phases in the literature from both theoretical and experimental point of view for the energetic solid agcno .",
    "therefore , we systematically investigated the above mentioned properties for agcno using first principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows , in section ii , we briefly describe the methodology of our calculations . in section iii , the polymorphic phase stability , electronic struture , chemical bonding , and optical properties of agcno are discussed .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize the results , which concludes our paper .",
    "the polymorphic phases of agcno crystals were studied using periodic dft calculations performed with two different codes such as plane wave self consistent field ( pwscf ) @xcite and cambridge series of total energy package ( castep ) @xcite , which are based on planewave pseudopotential ( pw - pp ) approach . we have used vanderbilt type ultrasoft pseudo potentials@xcite to treat ion - electron interactions , while electron - electron interactions are treated with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite and perdew and wang ( pw91)@xcite . the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) minimization scheme @xcite was used in geometry optimization .",
    "the plane wave cutoff energy was set to 60 ry and a k - point grid of 7@xmath157@xmath154 and 5@xmath155@xmath155 for _ cmcm _ and _ r@xmath0 _ phases , respectively using monkhorst - pack grid scheme @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent energy convergence accuracy was set to 1.0@xmath1510@xmath16 ev / atom and the force to be 1.0@xmath1510@xmath17 ev / a .",
    "the standard lda / gga functionals are unabale to describe the non - covalent interactions in molecular crystals . on the other hand ,",
    "semiemipirical dispersion correction methods such as the ortmann , bechstedt , and schmidt ( dft - obs)@xcite correction to pw91 , as well as the tkatchenko and scheffler ( dft - ts)@xcite and grimme ( dft - d2)@xcite corrections to pbe were employed to handle vdw interactions .",
    "these methods are found to improve the results to a greater extent . here",
    "the total energy after inclusion of vdw correction is given by @xmath18 where e@xmath19 is the self - consistent kohn - sham energy , e@xmath20 is empirical dispersion correction given by @xmath21 where s@xmath22 is global scaling factor that only depends on the density functional used .",
    "c@xmath23 denotes the dispersion coefficient for the pair of i@xmath24 and j@xmath24 atoms that depends only on the chemical species , and r@xmath23 is an interatomic distance .",
    "f@xmath25 = @xmath26 is a damping function which is necessary to avoid divergence for small values of r@xmath23 and r@xmath27 is the sum of atomic vdw radii .",
    "the dft - d2 method has been applied to several molecular systems such as secondary explosives@xcite and inorganic azides@xcite , and these results demostrated that dispersion corrections are important in determining the ground state properties .",
    "hence , we attempted to study the phase stability of agcno using the dft - d2 method and the results are discussed in the following section .",
    "the thermodynamic stabilities were investigated by comparing the free energy of the polymorphs . in order to predict the most stable form of agcno , we have calculated the gibbs free energy of both polymorphic phases .",
    "the gibbs free energy for any material at a given temperature is as follows .",
    "@xmath28 where f , p , t , and v are the helmoltz free energy , pressure , absolute temperature and volume , respectively .",
    "f(v , t ) is summation of vibrational free energy and perfect lattice energy _",
    "i.e _ f(v ,",
    "t ) = f@xmath29 + f@xmath30 .",
    "the vibrational free energy f@xmath29 is calculated within the harmonic approximation and is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the phonon frequency , @xmath33 is the planck constant and @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant . where f@xmath30 = e@xmath27 + e@xmath35 - ts@xmath35 , e@xmath27 and e@xmath35- ts@xmath35 are the contributions from the lattice and electronic excitations , respectively .",
    "if the electronic excitations and pressure changes are neglected then the gibbs free energy can be calculated by g = e@xmath36 + f@xmath29 .",
    "extreme sensitivity , poor stability and high cost of silver as a raw material prohibited agcno in commercial or military priming and detonating devices @xcite but still it finds applications in pyrotechincs , fire works , toy pistols and in the navy .",
    "however , the relative stability and necessary conditions for the formation of two polymorphic phases are still unknown for this material .",
    "as discussed in section i , agcno exists in two polymorphic phases at ambient conditions , and it is noticed that except the crystal structures @xcite of both phases most of the physical properties are not well understood from experimental and theoretical prospective . hence we take an opportunity to investigate the relative thermodynamic phase stability of the polymorphs .    as a first step , we have performed full structural optimization by taking experimental data as a input.@xcite the lattice parameters and fractional co - ordinates of both the phases are allowed to relax to get the most stable configurations at ambient pressure .",
    "the optimized crystal structures of orthorhombic ( _ cmcm _ ) and rhombohedral ( _ r@xmath0 _ ) phases are shown in fig .",
    "the crystal structures of two polymorphic phases mainly differ by planar zigzag chains ( orthorhombic phase in yz plane ) and cyclic hexamers ( rhombohedral phase in xy plane)@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ cmcm ] ) and these agcno molecules are bind through weak vdw forces within the unitcell . we have calculated the structural properties and their pressure dependence within standard dft functionals using pwscf and castep codes .",
    "the obtained volumes for _ cmcm _ and _ r@xmath0 _ phases are overestimated by 22.5@xmath37 and 13.5@xmath37 with pbe - gga , respectively .",
    "this clearly represents that pbe - gga functional is inadequate to predict the ground state properties of this energetic molecular solid .",
    "therefore , we have used various dispersion corrected ( dft - d ) methods to capture vdw interactions to reproduce the ground state properties comparable with the experiments.@xcite the obtained volumes are overestimated by about 12.6@xmath37 , 7.8@xmath37 using dft - obs ; 3.7@xmath37 , 4.2@xmath37 using dft - ts ; and 2.2@xmath38 4.5@xmath37 using dft - d2 methods for _ cmcm _ , _ r@xmath0 _ phases , respectively . among the three dft - d methods , dft - ts and dft - d2 methods work well for the molecular solid agcno , still there are dicrepancies between the theoretical values at 0 k and experimental data at 298 k@xcite .",
    "the order of discrepancies about @xmath53 - 4@xmath37 are previously reported for seconadry explosive molecular crystals with dft - d methods at 0 k@xcite and these errors were further reduced by inclusion of thermal effects in the calculations@xcite and the obtained results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data . in the present study ,",
    "the equilibrium volumes are overestimated within static dft - d2 , if we include the temperature effects there will be an increment in the volumes due to thermal expansion which leads to large dicrepancies over static dft - d2 results unless the polymorphs have negative thermal expansion .",
    "the calculated ground state lattice parameters , unitcell volume , and density of both polymorphic phases using various dispersion corrected dft functionals are compared with experimental data and are presented in table i. the obatined ground state properties with and without dispersion correction methods using pwscf and castep are in good accord with each other ( see table i ) . in general , the energy difference between different polymorphic forms are mostly in the order of 0 - 10 kj / mole.@xcite the dft - d2 method is successful in predicting the polymorphs of benzamide ( p1 and p3 ) with an energy difference by 1.9 kj / mole.@xcite hence , we have used dft - d2 method for further calculations . the obtained total energy difference for _ cmcm _ phase lowered by @xmath56 kj / mole per molecule than _ r@xmath0 _ phase which implies that _ cmcm _ phase found to be the thermodynamic ground state at ambient pressure .",
    "britton et al @xcite proposed that _",
    "cmcm _ is stable than _ r@xmath0 _ phase due to the presence of linear form of cno anions in their crystal structures.@xcite the predicted behavior with dft - d2 method are in good agreement with the experimental observations@xcite and this clearly shows the success of dft - d2 method in predicting the relative phase stability of the ploymorphic phases of agcno .",
    "the investigation of energetic materials at extreme conditions is a challenging task because of their sensitivity , complex chemical behavior and risk of decomposition .",
    "several accidents occured during the preparation of agcno@xcite and hence it is very difficult to perform experiments without any prior knowledge about this kind of energetic materials .",
    "therefore , theoretical modeling and simulations are efficient tools to predict the physical and chemical properties of complex energetic solids at extreme conditions and also very useful in predicting results a priori to the experimentalists .",
    "dft is a powerful tool in predicting the behavior of complex solid state systems at extreme conditions .",
    "hence , we attempted to study the relative phase stability and possible polymorphic structural transition in agcno under hydrostatic pressure upto 5 gpa with a step size of 0.5 gpa . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pt ] , the calculated enthalpy curves as a function of pressure using standard dft functionals show that _",
    "r@xmath0 _ phase undergoes a structural ploymorphic phase transition to _ cmcm _ phase at about 2.5 gpa within gga using pwscf and the corresponding transition pressures obtained from castep code is 2.7 gpa ( see fig . 1 of supplementary material@xcite ) .",
    "overall , we observed a similar trends using both of the approaches with small deviations in the calculated transition pressures . above the transition",
    "pressures the enthalpy of the _ cmcm _ phase is lower than that of the _ r@xmath0 _",
    "phase , indicating that _ cmcm _ structure becomes stable .",
    "the _ cmcm _",
    "phase is stable in the pressure range from transition pressure to 5 gpa , which is the highest pressure we accomplished in the present work .",
    "the enthalpy ( total energy ) difference at 0 gpa is @xmath5 6 kj / mole which increases with pressure and it is found to be @xmath5 21 kj / mole at 5 gpa within dft - d2 method .",
    "in contrast to lda / gga functionals , the dft - d2 method using both of the approaches ( pwscf and castep ) reveals that there is no pressure induced ploymorphic phase transition seen in agcno and the _ cmcm _ phase is found to be the most stable form of agcno over studied pressure range using both pw - pp approaches ( see fig .",
    "hitherto , we represent _ cmcm _ and _ r@xmath0 _ phases as @xmath1 and @xmath2-agcno , respectively .",
    "our recent high pressure study on kclo@xmath3@xcite also revealed that dft - d2 method is good enough for calculating the transition pressures for molecular solids in opposition to standard lda / gga functionals .",
    "as shown in fig . [ pte ] ( see fig . 2 of supplementary material@xcite ) , the calculated total energies ploted as a function of pressure demonstrates that the dft - d2 functional predict the @xmath1-phase to be the most stable form of agcno over studied pressure range in contrast to usual lda / gga functionals .",
    "in addition , the contribution of lattice vibration needs to be considered at elevated temperatures .",
    "we have used norm - conserving pseudo potentials@xcite for calculating the gibbs free energy as they are well suited for phonon calculations as implemented in castep code .",
    "[ gt ] shows the gibbs free energy as a function of temperature in the range of 0 - 450 k within dft - d2 method . the difference in gibbs free energy ( @xmath39 g ) is @xmath5 7 kj / mole at low temperature region and it decreases monotonically with increase in temperature between the two @xmath1- and @xmath2-polymorphs of agcno",
    "however , @xmath1-agcno remains with the lowest free energy throughout the investigated temperature range , despite the contribution of lattice vibration tending to decrease the @xmath39 g gap at elevated temperatures .",
    "we have not observed any temperature driven phase transition between two polymorphs over studied temperature range and this is consistent with results of differential thermal analysis@xcite .",
    "gibbs free energies at temperatures beyond 450 k are not plotted because @xmath1-agcno phase typically decompose at higher temperatures between 393 - 450 k@xcite . from our present study , we confirmed that @xmath1-phase is the most stable polymorph of agcno under studied pressure and temperature range .      to study the effect of hydrostatic pressure on crystal structures of both the polymorphs , we have used variable cell optimization technique .",
    "the calculated volumes decrease monotonically as a function of pressure using standard lda / gga functionals as well as with dft - d2 method are shown in fig .",

    "this clearly indicates that the polymorphs behave anisotropically under the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "further , to understand the relative compressibilities of both the polymorphic phases bondlengths and bond angles as a function of hydrostatic pressure are plotted within dft - d2 method . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bl ] , ag - o bond is more compressible in both the phases along a - crystallographic direction whereas ag - ag is the most compressible in @xmath2-agcno .",
    "the bonds such as ag - c , c - n , and n - o show similar and less compressible nature over studied pressure range due to strong covalent bonding between ag and c as well as within the cno anion molecule and this can be clearly understood from their electronic structure . similarly the corresponding bond angles ag - c - ag decrease because of the orientation of ag - c bonds due to high compressibility nature of ag - ag bonds ( see fig .",
    "[ bl ] ) whereas ag - c - n bond angle increases under compression ( see fig .",
    "overall , we observe that ag - c , c - n , and n - o bonds are stiffer , while ag - ag and ag - o are more compressible under the application of hydrostatic pressure .",

    "it is necessary to understand the electronic structure , and chemical bonding of these materials at the microscopic level .",
    "iqbal et al @xcite carried out a detailed experimental study on the electronic structure and stability of the inorganic fulminates , which reveals that sodium , potasium , and thallous fulminates to be ionic salts whereas silver and mercury salts are covalent in nature and this will be reflected in the order of stability of the fulminate salts .",

    "it is well known fact that the standard lda / gga functionals severely underestimate the band gaps for semiconductors and insulators . in order to get relaiable",

    "[ absorp ] and absorption starts after the energy 3.51 ev in @xmath1-phase , 4.43 ev in @xmath2-phase , which is energy band gap between the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum .",
    "the first absorption peaks along three ( 100 , 010 and 001 ) directions are at 4.5 ev , 7.7 ev , 7.9 ev and the corresponding absorption coefficients are found to be 1.1 @xmath15 10@xmath57m@xmath6 , 1.4 @xmath15 10@xmath58m@xmath6 , 3.9 @xmath15 10@xmath58m@xmath6 for @xmath1-phase , while the same are 1.3 @xmath15 10@xmath58m@xmath6 at 6.8 ev and 4.0 @xmath15 10@xmath57m@xmath6 at 7.2 ev along two ( 100 and 001 ) directions for @xmath2-phase .",
    "photoconductivity is due to the increase in the number of free carriers when photons are absorbed .",
    "the calculated photoconductivity shows ( see fig . [ absorp ] ) a wide photocurrent response in the absorption region of 3.5 - 35 ev and 4.4 - 35 ev in @xmath1 and @xmath2 phases of agcno , respectively .",
    "overall , the energetic polymorphs show a strong anisotropic and wide range of absorption ( absorption coefficients @xmath5 10@xmath57m@xmath6 ) .",
    "this results indicate the possible decomposition of agcno into ag , co and n@xmath4 under the action of ultraviolet ( uv ) light .",
    "therefore agcno polymorphs decompose under the action of uv light and they may explode due to photochemical decomposition .",
    "in summary , _ ab - initio _ calculations have been performed to investigate the relative phase stability , structural transition and compressbilities of both polymorphic orthorhombic ( _ cmcm _ ) and trigonal ( _ r@xmath0 _ ) phases of agcno using pw - pp approaches .",
    "the standard lda / gga functionals are inadequate to predict the relative phase stability and ground state properties of these polymorpic phases . from our total energy calculations using dft - d2 method ,",
    "_ cmcm _ phase was found to be preferred thermodynamic equilibrium phase under pressure and temperature range and hence we confirmed _ cmcm _ and _ r@xmath0 _ phases as @xmath1 and @xmath2-agcno , respectively .",
    "the present study also reveals that there is no structural phase transition observed using dft - d2 method whereas we observe a pressure induced polymorphic phase transition from @xmath2 @xmath7 @xmath1 at about 2.5 ( 2.7 ) gpa within gga using pwscf ( castep ) package .",
    "overall , the phase stability and ground state properties obtained from both the pw - pp approaches are in good accord with each other for both of the polymorphs .",
    "we have also calculated the electronic structure and density of states of both polymorphic phases using tb - mbj functional at ambient pressure .",
    "the calculated electronic band structure show that @xmath1 , @xmath2 phases are indirect band gap insulators with a band gap values of 3.51 and 4.43 ev , respectively .",
    "the detailed analysis of electronic charge density distribution and partial density of states reveal covalent bonding is predominant in the energetic agcno polymorphs .",
    "the major peaks in @xmath48 are due to interband transitions between ag(@xmath49 ) @xmath7 n(@xmath50)-states .",
    "the calculated absorption spectra reveal that the polymorphs show considerable anisotropy and decompose under the action of uv light .",
    "finally , the present study suggests that the @xmath1-form is stable and it can be used in different applications and @xmath2-form can be avoided by careful control of the pressure or temperature in the manufacturing process .",
