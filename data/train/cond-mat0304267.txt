    "nevertheless , for the hard - sphere fluid which , apart from freezing , exhibits only a single phase both routes are expected to be in qualitative or even semi - quantitative agreement with each other .",
    "first we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] our numerical results for the surface tension at a spherical wall as obtained by full minimization of the rosenfeld functional for values of @xmath98 in the range between @xmath126 and @xmath127 and with radii of curvature @xmath128 in the range @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the dft results are denoted by symbols and the predictions of the bulk theory by full lines . for small values of @xmath98",

    "recently it was suggested that spt can be re - optimized by taking the planar wall limit into account more accurately @xcite .    even for packing fractions",
    "at which the level of quantitative agreement is moderate ( see fig .",

    "this implies that the curvature dependence of our numerical data of @xmath132 can be best approximated by a polynomial quadratic in @xmath133 with no evidence for a logarithmic term .",
    "the dft results for the surface tension of a hard - sphere fluid in contact with a hard cylindrical wall are shown in fig .",

    "again the quantitative agreement between the dft results ( symbols ) and predictions of the bulk theory ( full lines ) are excellent for low packing fractions and fair at higher values of @xmath98 .",
    "the curvature dependence of the dft data is captured very well by a function linear in @xmath134 as predicted by the bulk route .    a remarkable feature of eq .",
    "( [ eqn:34 ] ) is that the ratio of the coefficients corresponding to the term of the leading order in @xmath135 for spherical and cylindrical symmetry is exactly 2 ( since @xmath136 ) .",
    "this behavior can also be found in the numerical results of dft calculations , i.e. , based on the inhomogeneous density profiles @xmath137 . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we show values of least - square fits assuming that @xmath138 and @xmath139 , i.e. , the simplest formulae to fit our dft data . to a good approximation",

    "thus neither the bulk theory nor the numerical dft results provide any hints for the occurrence of logarithmic terms in the expression of the surface tension of hard - sphere fluids in contact with curved hard surfaces .    for the contact density one knows a priori that for all values of @xmath98 both the dft route and the bulk approach yield the same contact value @xmath146 of the density profile of a hard - sphere fluid in the limit of the planar wall . for finite curvature",

    "[ fig:3 ] for spherical walls and in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] for cylindrical walls . only for very large curvatures the actual dft contact densities",
    "are slightly overestimated by the bulk theory .    for the spherical wall in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we also plot the contact density obtained from an empirical fit to simulation data ( dotted lines ) by degreve et al . @xcite . in terms of @xmath148",
    "this fit interpolates linearly between the planar wall limit within the carnahan - starling theory and the contact value of the pair correlation function @xmath149 corresponding to @xmath150 . at high packing fractions",
    "this fit deviates from our results in the planar wall limit due to the difference between the carnahan - starling equation of state and the percus - yevick compressibility pressure which underlies both our approaches . at very high packing fractions",

    "4 .   the ratio of the leading order terms in the expansion of the surface tension as a function of curvature , obtained from full minimization of the fundamental measure functional , for cylindrical and spherical symmetry equals 2 ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the aforementioned bulk theory ( eq .",

    "this also agrees with the general feature of the helfrich theory @xcite , in which for a sphere the contribution to the surface tension linear in the curvature is twice as large as for a cylinder .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the arguments in favor of and against the existence of logarithmic singularities in the curvature dependence of the surface tension of fluids have been reviewed .",
