    "very recently , several papers appeared dealing with the theory of the casimir effect in systems consisting of two perfectly reflecting plates separated by a layered medium@xcite . among the other results , these works provided formulas for the casimir force and/or energy for a few simple systems of this sort ( with up to five layers media@xcite between the plates ) .",
    "using the theory of the casimir effect in multilayers@xcite and nonstandard recursion relations for fresnel coefficients@xcite , in this note we derive formulas for the casimir force and energy for systems with arbitrary plates separated by arbitrary inhomogeneous , generally @xmath0-layered , media .",
    "consider the system consisting of two planar objects ( plates ) separated by a layered medium , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sys ] . according to the theory of the casimir effect in multilayers@xcite ,",
    "the casimir forces on the left ( @xmath1 ) and the right ( @xmath2 ) plate are given by @xmath3 respectively , where ( unless necessary , we omit the polarization index @xmath4 when writing fresnel coefficients ) @xmath5 is the relevant component of the vacuum - field ( minkowski ) stress tensor in the layer @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the perpendicular wave vector at the imaginary frequency ( @xmath8 ) in the layer , @xmath9 is the magnitude of the wave vector parallel to the system surfaces and @xmath10 are the reflection coefficients of the right and left stack of layers bounding the layer @xmath6 .",
    "these reflection coefficients obey generalized recursion relations @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes an intermediate layer and where the symbol @xmath13 is used to denote the stack of layers between layers @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as seen , these recurrence relations look the same as the standard ones @xcite ( to which they reduce in case that layers @xmath6 and @xmath12 are neighbor layers ) , however , this time they generally involve fresnel coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the _ stack _ between the layers @xmath6 and @xmath12 .    using the above recursion relations , reflection coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath22 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath23 and identified @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the reflection coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , of the plates . therefore , from ( [ flr ] ) and ( [ tj ] ) we obtain for the forces on the plates    [ flr2 ] @xmath28    where @xmath29 as seen , since @xmath30 unless the medium is not symmetric across the gap , these forces are not generally equal in magnitude and each of them consists of a lifshitz - like force ( given by the second terms in ( [ flr2 ] ) ) and a force due to the inhomogeneity of the medium .",
    "we also note that owing to the medium inhomogeneity there is a force@xcite @xmath31 on the central stack of the medium given explicitly by @xmath32 when @xmath33 , this generalizes previously obtained result for the force on a slab in a planar cavity@xcite to configurations with the slab replaced by an unspecified multilayered stack .",
    "having determined forces on the plates , we can calculate the casimir energy of the system from@xcite @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 in the following , we illustrate this formula by discussing its implications for several simple systems and comparing them with the results obtained in refs . - .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ nn ] ) and ( [ e ] ) give correctly the casimir energy in case of a homogeneous medium between the plates . indeed , assuming that all @xmath0 medium layers are made of the same matter ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40}$ ] so that @xmath41}$ ] and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the distance between the plates .",
    "this leads to the standard lifshitz - type formula@xcite for the casimir energy .",
    "for perfectly reflecting plates@xcite , we must let here @xmath44 .    in the @xmath45 case ( two media between the plates ) , we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the _ single - interface _ fresnel coefficients@xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . noting that @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 which , in conjunction with ( [ e ] ) , gives the casimir energy for the present system .",
    "this result coincides with the corresponding result obtained in ref . providing that we let for perfectly reflecting plates @xmath55 .",
    "we note , however , that perfect reflectors are standardly simulated by media with infinitely large permittivities ( conductivities ) in which case ( [ sic ] ) implies ( @xmath56 ) that @xmath57 but @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , with this convention , our result disagrees with that of ref . regarding the @xmath59 contribution to the casimir force / energy .",
    "using recursion relations ( [ rr ] ) , e for more complex ( @xmath60 ) systems can be written in terms of lower - layered stacks and , owing to the number of the medium layers , this can be done in a number of ways . clearly , to obtain the effective casimir energy , we can drop from these results the terms not involving @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "thus , for example , from ( [ rr ] ) we have@xcite    @xmath63    using this in ( [ nn ] ) and rearranging , we find @xmath64 where @xmath65 finally , inserting this @xmath66 in ( [ e ] ) and dropping the ( ineffective ) term involving @xmath67 , we find for the effective casimir energy @xmath68 of the system ( with respect to the layer @xmath12 ) @xmath69 this generalizes the ( @xmath70 ) result for the casimir interaction energy between two slabs obtained in ref using a realistic casimir piston approach and a five layer model for the medium to arbitrary multilayered slabs and plates . note that , when removing the plates by letting @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 and ( [ nkn ] ) and ( [ ek ] ) give the casimir interaction energy of the two stacks of layers separated by a layer of medium @xmath12 , as derived in ref . .",
    "we illustrate the above result by considering the n=3 system . in this case",
    ", there is only one intermediate layer and the effective casimir energy ( [ ek ] ) is entirely expressed in terms of the single - interface reflection coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from ( [ nkn ] )",
    ", we have ( @xmath75 ) @xmath76 as mentioned , for perfectly reflecting plates we must let here @xmath77 .",
    "this result then coincides with the corresponding result derived in ref . 1 whereas the results obtained in refs . 2 and 3 correspond to plates with @xmath55 and @xmath78 , respectively",
    "effectively , in this work we have extended the lifshitz formula to configurations with an inhomogeneous , n - layered , medium separating two planar objects .",
    "the force on each object is the sum of a lifshitz - like force and a force arising from the inhomogeneity of the medium . owing to this inhomogeneity",
    ", there is also a force acting on the medium .",
    "when the first and the last medium layer are made of the same matter , this result generalizes previously obtained one for the force on a slab in a planar cavity to arbitrary multilayered slabs .",
