    "the understanding of the physics behind jet production in the context of perturbative qcd is an essential ingredient in phenomenological studies at present and future colliders . at high energies",
    "the theoretical study of multijet events becomes an increasingly important task . in the context of collinear factorization the calculation of multijet production is complicated because of the large number of contributing diagrams .",
    "there is , however , a region of phase space where it is indeed possible to describe the production of a large number of jets : the regge asymptotics ( small@xmath1 region ) of scattering amplitudes .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the center  of  mass energy in the process under study , @xmath2 , can be considered asymptotically larger than any other participating scale . in this limit",
    "the dominating diagrams are those with gluons being exchanged in the @xmath3channel .",
    "a perturbative analysis of these diagrams shows that it is possible to resum contributions of the form @xmath4 to all orders , with @xmath5 being the coupling constant for the strong interaction .",
    "this can be achieved by means of the balitsky ",
    "kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) equation  @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient in the bfkl approach is the concept of the _ reggeized gluon _ or _",
    "reggeon_. in regge asymptotics colour octet exchange can be effectively described by a @xmath3channel gluon with its propagator being modified by a multiplicative factor depending on a power of @xmath2 .",
    "this power , also known as _ gluon regge trajectory _ , depends on the transverse momenta of the gluon and is not infrared finite .",
    "however , when real emissions are included using gauge invariant reggeon  reggeon ",
    "gluon couplings , the divergences cancel out .",
    "it is then possible to describe scattering amplitudes with any number of particles ( jets ) in the final state .",
    "the @xmath4 resummation is known as leading ",
    "order ( lo ) approximation and provides a simple picture of the underlying physics .",
    "nevertheless it is not free of drawbacks , the main two being that , at lo , both @xmath5 and the factor scaling the energy @xmath2 in the resummed logarithms , @xmath6 , are free parameters not determined by the theory .",
    "these limitations can be removed if the accuracy in the calculation is increased , and next  to  leading ( nlo ) terms of the form @xmath7 are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "when this is done , diagrams contributing to the running of the coupling have to be included , and also @xmath6 is not longer undetermined . as an example , in the context of mueller  navelet jets , the introduction of nlo effects in the kernel has been recently shown to have a large phenomenological impact , in particular , for azimuthal angle decorrelations  @xcite .    at lo",
    "every reggeon  reggeon ",
    "gluon vertex corresponds to one single gluon emission , and the produced gluon can form a single jet . at nlo",
    "the situation is more complicated since the emission vertex also contains reggeon  reggeon  gluon  gluon and reggeon  reggeon  quark  antiquark contributions . in the present work we are interested in the description of the inclusive production of one jet in the bfkl formalism at nlo",
    "this means that the relevant events are those with only one jet produced in the central rapidity region of the detector . in order to find the probability of production of a single jet it is necessary to introduce a jet definition in the emission vertex",
    "this is simple at lo , but at nlo we should carefully study the possibility of a double emission in the same region of rapidity , leading to the production of one or two jets",
    ". this will be the main goal of the present paper .",
    "our aim is to clearly separate the different contributions to the cross section , and to explain in detail which scales are relevant .",
    "particular attention is given to the separation of multi  regge and quasi ",
    "multi  regge kinematics .",
    "an earlier analysis has been presented in ref .",
    "we have independently repeated these calculations , and we have found several discrepancies which will be explained in the text .",
    "our analysis will be done in two different cases : inclusive jet production in the scattering of two photons with large and similar virtualities , and in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions . in the former case",
    "the cross section has a factorized form in terms of the photon impact factors and of the gluon green s function which is valid in the regge limit . in the latter case , since the momentum scale of the hadron is substantially lower than the typical @xmath0 entering the production vertex , the gluon green s function for hadron ",
    "hadron collisions has a slightly different bfkl kernel which , in particular , also incorporates some @xmath0evolution from the nonperturbative , and model dependent , proton impact factor to the perturbative jet production vertex .",
    "we provide analytic formul for these two processes , and the numerical analysis is left for a future publication .    in the case of hadron ",
    "hadron scattering , our cross section formul contains an _ unintegrated gluon density _ which , in addition to the usual dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction typical of collinear factorization , carries an explicit dependence on the transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "this scheme is known as @xmath0factorization .",
    "so far , no systematic attempt has been made to generalize this framework beyond lo accuracy . in the small@xmath1 region , where this type of factorization has attracted particular interest ,",
    "the bfkl framework offers the possibility to formulate , in a systematic way , the generalization of the @xmath0factorization to nlo .",
    "we therefore interpret our analysis also as a contribution to the more general question of how to formulate the unintegrated gluon density and the @xmath0factorization scheme at nlo : our results can be considered as the small@xmath1 limit of a more general formulation .",
    "after this short introduction , in section 2 we define , closely following ref .",
    "@xcite , our notations for the description of a general cross section in the bfkl approach",
    ". we also introduce multi  regge kinematics ( mrk ) and the iterative structure of the cross sections at lo . in section 3",
    "we describe the basic elements contributing at nlo .",
    "the linearity of the bfkl equation remains the same while the emission kernel now has several pieces such as virtual contributions to one gluon emission and double emissions .",
    "we describe them in some detail , including a procedure to avoid double counting when the mrk is separated from the quasi ",
    "multi  regge kinematics ( qmrk ) .",
    "the discussion of inclusive jet production starts with a lo description in section 4 . following this introductory part , we present , in section 5 , a definition of the nlo jet vertex .",
    "we separate the different regions of phase space in such a way that the cancellation of infrared divergences is explicit for the two cases above  mentioned : inclusive jet production in @xmath8 and in hadron ",
    "hadron interactions .",
    "we will also discuss the definition of a nlo unintegrated gluon distribution valid in the small@xmath1 regime . to close we study in section 6 the r^ ole of the scale separating mrk from qmrk and",
    "show how , even with the jet definition , it is possible to prove that the dependence on this scale is power suppressed .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions and suggest future lines of research .",
    "for the sake of clarity , in the present section we introduce the notation we will follow in the rest of this study .",
    "bfkl cross sections present a factorized structure in terms of a universal green s function , which carries the dependence on @xmath2 , and impact factors , which have to be calculated for each process of interest .",
    "this factorization remains unchanged in the transition from lo to nlo .",
