    "one of the direct technological applications of magnetic nanoparticles is magnetic recording .",
    "the storage capacity of the media can be considerably increased by devising denser assemblies of smaller and smaller particles . however",
    ", this brings a dilemma because small particles become superparamagnetic , i.e. , thermally unstable , well below the room temperature .",
    "moreover , high density in assemblies entails strong dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) between the particles , and in technological applications such as magnetic recording , this is an issue of special importance since ddi have been widely recognized as being responsible for the deterioration of the signal - to - noise ratio ( see e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "as such , an optimal material , with appropriate anisotropy and other physical parameters , has still to be devised . on the other hand , the study of nanoparticle assemblies brings new hurdles to theorists , at least , since one is faced with tremendous difficulties related with ddi between particles , together with the distributions of volume and anisotropy axes . in spite of that ,",
    "ddi in nanoparticle assemblies has triggered much interest due to many new phenomena that emerge from the collective behavior of the particles and also because these interactions have always constituted a challenging issue in many areas of physics . to analyze and eventually understand experiments on the dynamics of interacting nanoparticle assemblies , and",
    "in particular to understand the dynamical response , such as the ac susceptibility and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetizations , one needs to know how ddi affect the switching process and the relaxation time of the nanoparticles .",
    "while a fair understanding of the mechanisms underlying the zfc - fc magnetization process and ac susceptibility has been achieved in the case of non - interacting assemblies , many experimental results on interacting assemblies remain unexplained .",
    "obviously , this is mainly due to the long range of ddi and also to the complexities of the very calculation of the relaxation time itself .",
    "recently , jnsson and garcia - palacios @xcite [ see also @xcite ] obtained an approximate expression for the relaxation rate of a weakly interacting monodisperse assembly of macropins with textured or randomly - distributed anisotropy .",
    "the macrospin approximation here means that a particle is represented by a macroscopic magnetic moment , i.e. , ignoring its internal structure .",
    "this picture of the particle will henceforth be referred to as the one - spin problem ( osp ) . in the literature , this is also known as the coherent - rotation limit . then using the simple debye relaxation model they investigated the effect of ddi on the ac susceptibility and in particular the displacement of the maximum of its real and imaginary components . in their explanation of this effect",
    "they emphasized the important role played by damping in the relaxation processes in the presence of a transverse field in addition to the effect of the change in the energy barriers , that was commonly believed to play the major role .",
    "the role of a transverse field is played here by the transverse component of the dipolar field .",
    "experimental results obtained for ferrofluids @xcite and later for @xmath0-fe@xmath1o@xmath2 nanoparticles @xcite indicated that for dilute samples ( weak ddi ) , the temperature @xmath3 at the maximum of the zfc magnetization first increases with increasing field , attains a maximum and then decreases .",
    "more experiments performed on the @xmath0-fe@xmath1o@xmath2 particles dispersed in a polymer @xcite matrix confirmed the previous results for dilute samples and showed that , on the contrary , for concentrated samples ( strong ddi ) @xmath4 is a monotonically decreasing function of the magnetic field . the shift of this maximum was also studied with different techniques in various types of nanoparticles , see for instance @xcite . in ref .",
    "it was shown that the bell - like shape of @xmath5 is not very sensitive to the intrinsic properties of the particles , of course in the osp approximation .",
    "exact numerical calculations @xcite of the smallest eigenvalue of the fokker - planck operator invariably led to a monotonic decrease in the blocking temperature , and thereby in the temperature @xmath4 , as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , it was shown that the expression of the single - particle relaxation time does not play a crucial role and that even the ( relatively ) simple nel - brown expression for the relaxation time in a longitudinal field leads to a maximum in @xmath6 .",
    "what seemed to play a crucial role is the fact that the magnetization , formulated within the gittleman , abeles , and bozowski ( gab ) model @xcite , has a superparamagnetic contribution that is a non - linear function ( such as langevin s ) of the magnetic field .",
    "the magneto - crystalline anisotropy and the volume - distribution width also have strong influence .",
    "the issue of the effect of ddi on @xmath6 , namely the disappearance of the maximum when the intensity of interactions increases , was left open in ref .  .",
    "in the present work we revisit this issue after generalizing the work of ref .",
    "to include the static magnetic field and magnetic - moment distribution ( polydisperse assembly ) of nanoparticles in the osp approximation .",
    "we then investigate the effect of ( weak ) ddi on the zfc magnetization and in particular on @xmath6 .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : after fixing the notation and defining the model hamiltonian , we explain our formalism for computing the zfc magnetization within the gab model : we compute the contribution of ddi to the longitudinal relaxation rate , and then show how the gab model is accordingly extended .",
    "next , we discuss the effect of ddi on @xmath6 of a given assembly and compare the results for two materials , namely maghemite and cobalt .",
    "we consider an assembly of magnetic moments @xmath7 of magnitude @xmath8 and direction @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . the magnitude of the magnetic moment @xmath11 is given in terms of the bohr magneton @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 , and the numbers @xmath14 are log - normal distributed .",
    "each magnetic moment is assigned a uniaxial easy axis @xmath15 , and for the assembly these axes are randomly distributed .",
    "the energy of a magnetic moment @xmath11 with uniaxial anisotropy axis @xmath16 , interacting with all the others via ddi , in the magnetic field @xmath17 , reads [ after multiplying by @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the dimensionless energy parameters .",
    "note that @xmath22 ( or simply @xmath23 for a monodisperse assembly ) is the commonly used notation for the reduced anisotropy - energy barrier height of the particle @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the ddi tensor defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , is the vector joining the sites @xmath24 and @xmath29 and whose magnitude is measured in units of @xmath30 , a characteristic distance on the matrix in which the particles are embedded .",
    "more precisely , the parameter @xmath30 is taken as a real number times the mean diameter @xmath31 of the assembly , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , large values of @xmath33 correspond to an isotropically inflated lattice with large distances between the magnetic moments , and thereby weak ddi .",
    "the dynamic response of the osp assembly is given by the ac susceptibility .",
    "for a given particle with an arbitrary angle @xmath34 between its anisotropy easy axis and the field direction , the effective susceptibility may be written as @xmath35 shliomis and stepanov @xcite proposed a simple debye form for @xmath36 , which can be generalized to describe the effect of a longitudinal bias field by writing @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are appropriate longitudinal ( interwell ) and transverse ( intrawell ) relaxation times ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the longitudinal and transverse components of the equilibrium susceptibility . in the limit of a high anisotropy - energy barrier ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath42 , approximate expressions were found in ref .   for the longitudinal and transverse components of the equilibrium susceptibility .",
    "if one sets in ( [ chi_shs ] ) @xmath43 [ instantaneous intrawell transverse response ] and uses the high - barrier approximation one arrives at the gab model @xcite , generalized to @xmath44 and an arbitrary anisotropy - axis orientation .",
    "more precisely , upon evaluating the high - barrier expressions for @xmath45 , inserting the result in ( [ chi_shs ] ) , setting @xmath43 , and averaging over an assembly with randomly distributed anisotropy axes , one arrives at the expression proposed in ref .  , @xmath46 the real and imaginary components then read @xmath47 where @xmath48 are respectively the susceptibility at thermodynamic equilibrium and the initial susceptibility of particles in the blocked state ( see @xcite and references therein ) . accordingly , starting from ( [ chi_gab_ra_reim ] ) the application of an alternating field yields : a ) @xmath49 if @xmath50 at high temperature the magnetic moments orientate themselves on a great number of occasions during the time of a measurement , and thus the susceptibility is the superparamagnetic susceptibility @xmath51 b ) @xmath52 if @xmath53 at low temperature the energy supplied by the field is insufficient to reverse the magnetic moments the time of a measurement .",
    "then , the susceptibility is the static susceptibility @xmath54 between these two extrema there exists a maximum at the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath55 can be calculated from ( [ chi_gab_ra_reim ] ) using the formula for the relaxation time @xmath56 appropriate to the anisotropy symmetry , and considering a particular volume @xmath57 one can determine the temperature @xmath4 .",

    "we can also derive an expression for the transverse equilibrium susceptibility as a response to a transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for the second calculation , we generalize the expression obtained in ref .",
    "for the relaxation time ( including ddi ) to include the volume distribution and the static magnetic field .",
    "this is done in the next section . while the outcome of the first calculation is an insignificant quantitative modification of @xmath3 , the ddi contribution to the relaxation time yields a dramatic qualitative and quantitative effect since @xmath3 changes from a bell - like to a monotonically decreasing function . indeed , with regard to eq .",

    "it was shown that the ddi induce an increment of the amount of small barriers , responsible for faster decay . in our case , this is equivalent to the decrease of @xmath101 under the effect of ddi .",

    "[ fig : zfc ] we plot the zfc magnetization thus obtained as a function of temperature for various values of the applied field of a polydisperse assembly of non - interacting maghemite nanoparticles with mean diameter @xmath135 and standard deviation @xmath136 and random anisotropy . apart from the obvious bell - like shape and the vertical shift of the maximum with the increasing field",

    "first of all , we observe that indeed the effect of ddi is to change @xmath5 from a bell - like curve with a maximum to a monotonically decreasing function , and this compares well with the experimental results [ see fig . 1 of ref .  ] . as was stressed in ref .  , the effect of ddi is not merely to change the potential energyscape , as was argued in many previous publications @xcite , but also to introduce a transverse field that induces saddle points in the potential @xcite .",
    "this in turn makes the relaxation rate quite sensitive to the damping strength , and for relatively low damping , as is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmax_ddi ] ( @xmath137 ) , the probability of switching increases .",
    "in addition , if a magnetic field is added with increasing intensity , the energy barrier is lowered and the magnetic moments switch at lower temperatures .",
    "this concomitant effect makes the relaxation time shorter and for a given observation time , the temperature @xmath5 increases .",
    "this is of course compatible with the effect , discussed above , that ddi reduce the population of superparamagnetic particles in favor of the blocked ones and this leads to a larger @xmath5 . in summary , the critical volume @xmath101 ( or equivalently @xmath108 ) given by eq .",
    "( [ ncspmwddi ] ) in fact corresponds to the ",
    "critical \" field at the maximum of @xmath5 which , in the presence of the ddi field , separates : i ) the low - field regime : the population of blocked particles becomes more and more dominant , which leads to the increase of the `` average '' blocking temperature , and ii ) the high - field regime : the population of superparamagnetic particles takes over thus leading to a decrease of the average blocking temperature .",
    "furthermore , increasing the intensity of the ddi field increases both its longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "while the longitudinal component contributes to the increase of @xmath3 the transverse component shifts its maximum towards low magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we recall that the work of ref .   showed that , in the absence of ddi , the maximum of @xmath5 can be explained by the nonlinear variation of the superparamagnetic contribution to the zfc magnetization with the applied field . in the presence of ddi",
    "we see that the contribution of superparamagnetic particles is reduced in favor of blocked particles and this leads to the disappearance of the maximum .",

    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath140 [ see eq .",

    ", one should employ a numerical procedure for computing the relaxation rate with an oblique field , as is done in , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "however , we recall that the main objective of the present work was to i ) understand the effect of ddi on the @xmath5 curve and ii ) provide relatively simple ( approximate ) expressions including the ddi contribution . in addition , as the latter is only possible using perturbation theory which assumes weak ddi , a transverse magnetic field would be dominating and the subtle effect of the ddi field transverse component would not be easy to disentangle in a non ambiguous manner .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown here that the disappearance of the maximum of @xmath5 is mainly due to the effect of the transverse component of the ddi field on the relaxation rate of the magnetic moments .",
    "one could then ask why the transverse component of the applied magnetic field does not play the same role in the case of a free assembly .",
    "the main reason is that the applied magnetic field has a static effect while the ddi provide a field that changes dynamically with temperature and other physical parameters related with the dynamics of the system . in this respect , we wish to make a connection with the work @xcite where the effect of exchange interaction on the relaxation rate of a two - spin system was ( semi - analytically ) investigated by the kinetic langer s theory . it was shown that , in the weak coupling regime , when the first spin starts its switching process and arrives at the saddle point , the orientation of the second spin undergoes some fluctuations creating a small transverse field that increases the switching probability or the relaxation rate .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that in the present work we consider an assembly of nanoparticles placed at the sites of a regular ( simple cubic ) lattice , with varying inter - particle distances . the effect of changing the lattice structure or equivalently , the distribution of the vectors @xmath147 [ see eq .",

    "the position of the particles on the hosting matrix is random , and for a given concentration , the precise variation of the lattice sum @xmath151 should depend on the particular form of the particles spatial distribution function , which may dramatically change in the presence of aggregates , chains , and the like",
    ". we also found that changing the volume distribution @xmath120 width has only a quantitative effect on @xmath5 , very much similar to the results presented in fig .  4 of ref .   for a free assembly .",
    "hence , in both interacting and non - interacting assemblies , we find that when the volume distribution becomes narrower , @xmath3 decreases in magnitude and slightly flattens .",
    "in addition , changing from maghemite to cobalt particles , which is mainly equivalent ( in the present approach ) to changing the anisotropy constant by an order of magnitude , has a quantitative effect on the curve @xmath152 curves but the qualitative features remain the same .",
    "we have investigated the effect of ( weak ) dipolar interactions on the zero - field - cooled magnetization by computing their contribution to the longitudinal relaxation time .",
