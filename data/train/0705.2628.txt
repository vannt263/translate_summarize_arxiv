    "in many situations in dynamical systems and geometric measure theory one encounters results which are valid for almost every member of a parametrized family . in general , those results are sharp in the sense that the set of exceptions may have positive , or even full , dimension .",
    "but when the constructions are done in a dynamical or geometrically regular way , there is often some countable set of parameters , usually arising from an algebraic condition , where the result fails , and it is natural to conjecture that these are all parameters for which the result fails , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , there are very few cases where the set of exceptions has been explicitly determined . in this paper",

    "the paper is structured as follows . in the remainder of this section",

    "the proof of theorem [ th : sumcantor ] is in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] , while section [ sec : remainingproofs ] contains the proofs of the additional results stated at the end of this section .",
    "we finish the paper with some remarks and open questions in section [ sec : remarks ] .",
    "the study of the arithmetic sums of cantor sets is a classical topic in real analysis , motivated in part by its rich applications to diophantine approximation , the study of homoclinic bifurcations in dynamical systems , and other topics .",
    "the basic problem is to compute or estimate the size of the arithmetic sum @xmath38 in terms of the sizes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "`` size '' can mean different things , but in this paper we focus on hausdorff dimension .",
    "let @xmath39 be two compact subsets of the real line .",
    "observe that @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the line @xmath42 making angle @xmath43 with the @xmath44-axis .",
    "let @xmath45 by marstrand s projection theorem ( see @xcite , chapter 9 ) we have @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes lebesgue measure .",
    "unfortunately , marstrand s theorem gives no information about specific values of @xmath43 , and therefore can not be directly applied to obtain information about sums of cantor sets .",
    "however , it does support the heuristic principle that `` typically '' , @xmath31 note that our definition of geometrical resonance for the iterated function systems that generate @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( in the case where the sum of the dimensions is at most @xmath21 ) requires at least one exception to the projection theorem for the set @xmath48 .",
    "we now discuss some earlier results that motivated our work .",
    "the following result is due to peres and solomyak ( @xcite , theorem 1.1 ) , generalizing an earlier result of solomyak @xcite :    [ th : peressolomyak ] ( peres and solomyak ) let @xmath49 given a fixed compact set @xmath50 , the following holds for almost every @xmath51 : @xmath52    in this theorem , the cantor sets @xmath0 can be replaced by more general homogeneous self - similar sets ( see @xcite for details ) . if the ratio of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is rational , then @xmath55 this is folklore and can be seen as follows : if @xmath56 is rational , then there are @xmath57 and positive integers @xmath58 such that @xmath59 . by iterating @xmath60 times the construction of @xmath0 and @xmath61 times the construction of @xmath62 , we can decompose the product @xmath63 into a union of cylinder sets whose convex hulls are squares",
    ". moreover , two of these squares are @xmath64\\times [ 1-r^{mn},1]$ ] and @xmath65\\times [ 0,r^{mn}]$ ] .",
    "the projections of these squares on the line @xmath66 coincide .",
    "thus , if we delete one of them from the construction of @xmath67 , and delete the corresponding square at every level , we obtain a self similar set @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "see figure [ fig : dimdrop ] for an illustration of this idea .",
    "[ fig : dimdrop ]        * figure 1*. the structure of @xmath71 : for each white square there is a black square of the same level , and with the same projection onto the line @xmath72 .",
    "this results in a dimension drop for the projection , which is affinely equivalent to the arithmetic sum @xmath73 .",
    "it follows that one can not expect ( [ eq : sumcantorcompactdim ] ) to hold for _ all _ @xmath74 , even when @xmath11 is also a central cantor set . in @xcite ( as part of a more general framework ) the dimension of the set of exceptions in ( [ eq : sumcantorcompactdim ] ) was estimated , but whether the set of exceptions ( for @xmath75 ) is countable , was unknown until now .",
    "erolu @xcite proved that if @xmath76 , then the hausdorff measure of the sum set @xmath77 in the dimension @xmath78 is zero .",
    "in a different direction , moreira proved a result on the dimension of the sum of dynamically - defined , non - linear cantor sets .",
    "this result was stated in @xcite , but the proof sketched there is incorrect ; see @xcite for a correct proof based on moreira s ideas .",
    "we remark that moreira s theorem has explicit checkable conditions , but it applies to nonlinear constructions ; on the other hand the result of peres and solomyak applies to ( affine ) self - similar sets but it is an almost - everywhere type of result and gives no information about specific cases .",
    "theorem [ th : sumcantor ] fills this gap by determining the exact set of exceptions to ( [ eq : sumcantorcompactdim ] ) in the case where @xmath11 is also a central cantor set .",
    "in fact , our result holds for sums of general self - similar sets ; see theorem [ th : sumselfsimilar ] below .",
    "our research was also inspired by some conjectures of h. furstenberg [ personal communication ] , who in the eighties asked about the validity of theorem [ th : sumcantor ] in the particular case where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are integers which are not the power of a common integer .",
    "other conjectures of furstenberg , which are similar in spirit , remain open .",
    "for example , let @xmath81 be the one - dimensional sierpinski gasket ; i.e. @xmath82 furstenberg conjectured that @xmath83 has dimension @xmath21 but measure zero for all @xmath43 such that @xmath84 is irrational .",
    "the part of the conjecture concerning measure was proved by kenyon @xcite and generalized by lagarias and wang in @xcite , but the dimension part is still open .",
    "some related conjectures and results can be found in @xcite .",
    "palis  @xcite conjectured that , generically , if @xmath38 has positive lebesgue measure , then it has nonempty interior .",
    "this conjecture motivated much of the research on this topic , and it was eventually answered positively in @xcite . although our work is not directly related to palis conjecture ( indeed , we focus on the case where @xmath85 , and in particular @xmath38 has zero measure ) , it can be seen as a continuation of the same line of research .",
    "we remark that palis conjecture restricted to self - similar sets is still open ; i.e. it is not known whether sums of self - similar sets generically are either of zero measure or have nonempty interior .",
    "the topological structure of @xmath77 when @xmath86 was investigated in @xcite and @xcite ; the condition @xmath87 also arises naturally in this context .      the irrationality condition in theorem [ th : sumselfsimilar ] is equivalent to @xmath88 not being an arithmetic set ( a subset of @xmath26 is arithmetic if it is contained in some lattice @xmath89 ) .",
    "our next result shows that , under the assumption that the hausdorff dimension equals the so - called similarity dimension , theorem [ th : sumselfsimilar ] is sharp .",
    "we remark that this assumption is weaker than the well - known open set condition , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "then there exists some @xmath7 such that @xmath96    using self - similarity , it is easy to show that if there is one @xmath97 such that ( [ eq : dimdrop ] ) holds , then there are infinitely many . on the other hand ,",
    "according to marstrand s projection theorem , the set of parameters @xmath97 such that a dimension drop ( [ eq : dimdrop ] ) occurs , has zero length .",
    "furstenberg conjectured that this set is in fact countable , at least in the case where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are central cantor sets , but our methods do not seem to yield progress on this problem .",
    "a modification of the proof of theorems [ th : sumcantor ] and [ th : sumselfsimilar ] yields a new result on the projections of planar self - similar sets generated by an iterated function system that includes a scaled irrational rotation :    [ th : irrationalrotation ] let @xmath98 be a self - similar i.f.s . in @xmath99 with attractor @xmath22 .",
