    "characterization and quantification of quantum entanglement @xcite lies at the heart of quantum information theory , since its early recognition as `` spooky action at a distance '' @xcite in the einstein - podolsky - rosen article @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been successfully identified as a key resource in several quantum communication protocols including superdense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "entanglement has been shown to be a necessary ingredient in studying quantum state tomography @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , cooperative quantum phenomena in many body systems like quantum phase transitions @xcite , etc .",
    "quantification of entanglement is also essential for characterization of successful preparations of quantum states , both in two party and multiparty domains , in the laboratories @xcite .",
    "the notion of entanglement is rather well - understood in the bipartite regime , especially for pure states @xcite .",
    "while several entanglement measure can be computed for bipartite pure states , the situation for mixed states is difficult , and there are only few entanglement measures which can be computed efficiently .",
    "the logarithmic negativity @xcite can be obtained for arbitrary bipartite states , while the entanglement of formation @xcite can be computed for all two - qubit states .",
    "the situation becomes complicated even for the pure states when the number of parties increase .",
    "however , there have been significant advances in recent times to quantify multipartite entanglement of pure quantum states in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "they are broadly classified in two catagories @xmath0 distance - based measures @xcite and monogamy - based ones @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantifying entanglement for arbitrary multiparty mixed states is still an arduous task .",
    "recently , experiments by using photon polarization @xcite and ions @xcite have been reported in which multiparty states of the order of ten parties have been created successfully .",
    "such physical implementations demand a general tool to compute multiparty entanglement measures for arbitrary mixed states .",
    "recently there have been notable advancements in this direction @xcite .",
    "moreover , when an entanglement measure can only be evaluated for pure states , the entanglement - assisted study of cooperative phenomena becomes restricted to only a system which is at zero temperature .",
    "we address here the question of computing the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite , a genuine multiparty entanglement quantifier , for mixed states .",
    "the ggm of pure states has already been computed efficiently in several systems for arbitrary number of parties @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we define the ggm for mixed states via the convex roof . to deal with the obstacle of evaluating the convex roof extension , we use symmetry properties of certain multiparty quantum states and simplify the evaluation of ggm for these classes of mixed states , as prescribed in refs . @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . exploiting such symmetries , we are able to compute the ggm of different paradigmatic classes of mixed states having different ranks . in particular , we first present the exact value of ggm for certain classes of rank 2 and rank 3 mixed states with arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "we then compute the ggm for a specific class of states which is a mixture of greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) @xcite and all the dicke states @xcite , having a variety of ranks .",
    "the common property that all these classes possesses is that they remain invariant under the action of same symmetric local unitary operators on each qubit .",
    "moreover , we find the ggm of a class of tripartite states of rank 4 which remains unaltered under different local unitaries on each party .",
    "finally , we show that such symmetry properties can lead to an exact expression of ggm for a class of multiqudit states having varied ranks .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ggm_def ] , we review the definition and the various properties of the generalized geometric measure for pure states . in section [ sec : ggm_def_mixed ] , we define ggm for mixed states via the convex roof construction . here",

    "a pure state is said to be genuinely multiparty entangled if it is not product in any bipartition .",
    "the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of an @xmath1-party pure quantum state , @xmath2 , is a computable entanglement measure that can quantify genuine multiparty entanglement .",
    "it is defined as an optimized distance of the given state from the set of all states that are not genuinely multiparty entangled .",
    "mathematically , it is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , with the maximization being over all @xmath5 that are not genuinely multiparty entangled .",
    "an equivalent form of the above equation is @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the maximal schmidt coefficient in the bipartite split @xmath8 of @xmath9 .",
    "let us enumerate some properties of the ggm which establish it as a bona fide measure of genuine multiparty entanglement @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 , for all @xmath11 , @xmath12 iff @xmath11 is not genuinely multiparty entangled , and @xmath13 is nonincreasing under local quantum operations at the @xmath1 parties and classical communication between them .",
    "we can now define the ggm of a general mixed quantum state , in terms of the convex roof construction . for an arbitrary @xmath1-party mixed state , @xmath14 ,",
    "the ggm can be defined as @xmath15 where the minimization is over all pure state decompositions of @xmath14 i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "it is difficult to find the optimal decomposition and the computation of ggm is in general impossible even for moderate - sized systems .",
    "however , the situation is different if the mixed quantum state under consideration possesses some symmetry @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , vollbrecht and werner have provided a general method to compute an entanglement measure , defined via the convex roof extension , of a class of mixed states which are invariant , on average , under a group of local unitaries .",

    "a further step is needed where we convexify the optimized quantity over the parameters in @xmath14 , if it is not already convex .",
    "we now show that this method can be utilized to evaluate the ggm for several classes of multiparty states with arbitrary number of parties having certain symmetries .",

    "since it involves several parameters , for illustration , we choose fully symmetric states , i.e , when all the coefficients of @xmath2 and @xmath34 are equal .",

    "otherwise one has to convexify the function to obtain the ggm of @xmath164 .",
    "until now , we have considered systems with the same dimensions of the local hilbert spaces . however",

    "<S> computing entanglement of an arbitrary bipartite or multipartite mixed state is in general not an easy task as it usually involves complex optimization . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that exploiting symmetries of certain multiqudit mixed states , we can compute a genuine multiparty entanglement measure , the generalized geometric measure , for these classes of mixed states . </S>",
