    "in sociology , theorems are formulated rather rarely ; the thomas theorem is such an exception @xcite .",
    "the theorem states : if men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences @xcite .",
    "this reference to human mind , ubiquitous as it is in social sciences , seems to deserve more attention in sociophysical papers , where the first principle is to keep the model simple .",
    "( for the discussion of advantages and drawbacks of this principle we refer to @xcite . ) here we are going to reproduce the way of thinking of a rational agent who is not able to infer from a context ; instead , he defines the situation as it appears from direct observations .",
    "the problem is that the data he can acquire in a short time are limited to one or two numbers , while a proper decision should be based on a much larger statistics . yet , for some reasons he is willing to take decision at once .",
    "we ask , what can he deduce from limited data ?",
    "+ inference of this kind , although regular in real life , is rarely considered in scientific papers , with @xcite as an exception .",
    "the so - called german tank problem @xcite bears also some resemblance to this concept . yet",
    ", the ground is prepared by the idea of evolutionary game theory @xcite , where agents decide on the basis of an incomplete information . for games , the list of possible strategies",
    "is set by the definition of a given game . here",
    ", this knowledge is substituted by a formulation of a model of the time evolution of a given system .",
    "the task of an agent is to evaluate the model parameters .",
    "+ as an example of a social system , here we consider a queue .",
    "this example is by no means new .",
    "not pretending to a completeness , we provide a few examples of experimental papers . in a study on a long , overnight queue for football tickets in melbourne ,",
    "leon mann indicates that this queue is a miniature social system ( ... ) , formulating its own informal rules @xcite .",
    "two such rules have been identified there : @xmath0 first come , first served , called a fundamental concept of queueing , and @xmath1 the right of a temporal absence , necessary in long queues . in @xcite ,",
    "a cognitive bias towards unjustified optimism has been identified in the same melbourne queue at persons with little chances to get the tickets .",
    "various methods of norm executions in queues have been classified by stanley milgram and colleagues in @xcite .",
    "ellen langer has investigated the level of mindlessness in queues : as she demonstrated , people accept jumping to the queue front when requested , even if the request is formulated in a nonsensical way @xcite .",
    "+ here we propose to consider two simple models of the situation where a queuer observes that somebody jumps to the queue front .",
    "the queuer tries to evaluate his expected time of waiting , taking into account the estimated frequency of the jumping .",
    "these evaluations are to be performed on the basis of the observed data ; yet these data are assumed here to be limited to one or two observations . in both models , the queuer is able to perform some calculations or simulations ; here we assume that the results of these simulations is all what he can have .",
    "in other words , the queuer does not try to infer from the context : the physical or mental state of other queuers , publicly accessible opinions on waiting time and so on . to be more specific , we can assume that the queuer relies on an application at his smartphone , which is able to evaluate the time of waiting in a queue in the presence of intruders .",
    "+ in two subsequent sections , two models are presented : one of a queue of persons , and another one of two lines of vehicles before a street narrowing . for both models , the waiting time is found numerically , either as a function of the model parameters or at least in the form of the probability distribution . in both cases ,",
    "the results indicate that the evaluation can give very large values of the waiting time .",
    "the last section is devoted to the discussion of an expected human reaction to the result .",
    "suppose that an agent arrives to a queue for a taxi at an airport and mounts at its end . according to his expectation , the waiting time is just the product of the queue length @xmath2 and the mean time @xmath3 between arrivals of two subsequent vehicles .",
    "this evaluation ceases , however , its validity if the observer sees an intruder who jumps to the queue front and takes an arriving taxi . why he is allowed to do so ?",
    "perhaps it is because his military uniform ? wonders our queuer , strange in the new country . will others appear like that ?",
    "how often ? +     for a human queue , obtained with the algorithm in section [ s2 ] for @xmath4=2,3,5 .",
    "the probabilities of negative @xmath5 for these values of @xmath4 , obtained with the same algorithm , are 0.33 , 0.25 and 0.17 , respectively .",
    "the slope of the curve tail is close to -1 ( note the different bases of logarithms for the axis ) . ]",
    "if the mean time between intruders is @xmath6 , the waiting time @xmath5 can be found from    @xmath7    where the ratio @xmath8 is the expected number of intruders during the time @xmath5 .",
    "then ,    @xmath9    the value of the latter expression heavily depends on the observed difference @xmath10 , and it can be arbitrarily large if the observed @xmath6 is close to @xmath3 . actually , it is even possible that @xmath11 , which means that an intruder is observed earlier , than a taxi .",
    "provided that both these times are exponentially distributed , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the probability of such an event is    @xmath14    with this probability , the application gives an infinite waiting time . putting this strange result aside ,",
    "we calculate the probability distribution of the waiting time .",
    "the proposed algorithm is as follows : + 1 . find a few random moments @xmath15 with the exponential pdf ( probability density function ) with @xmath16 ( @xmath2-th time when somebody leaves is a sum of first @xmath2 moments ) + 2 .",
    "find a random moment @xmath6 when the intruder appears , also with the exponential pdf with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 + 3 .",
    "find @xmath3 as the mean @xmath15 from the events @xmath15 with the sum smaller than @xmath6 + 4 .",
    "( 2 ) to calculate @xmath19 ; if the result is negative , add 1 to the number of negative results. if @xmath20 , add the result to the histogram of @xmath21 .",
    "+ the results on the number of negative results coincide nicely with the eq .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath4= 2 , 3 and 5 .",
    "the histogram obtained for @xmath20 and the statistics of @xmath22 runs is shown in fig .",
    "as we see , the result is scale - free .",
    "this means , that very long waiting times are possible .",
    "suppose that two lines of vehicles wait before a street narrowing .",
    "to pass the narrowing , vehicles in the left line have only to reach it . on the contrary ,",
    "vehicles in the right line have additionally to change the line , because the narrowing blocks their line .",
    "each time when a vehicle in the left line passes the narrowing , a gap opens in the left line between the car which moves and the car immediately behind .",
    "if a car from the right line profits the gap and changes the line , the cars in the left line behind him do not move at all ; the chance is lost till the next time .",
    "the longer the queue , the smaller the chance to move for the cars in the left line .",
    "+     for the queue of vehicles .",
    "this probability , multiplied by @xmath23 at the next time step , is a measure of the vehicle probability flow over the narrowing .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the probability that a vehicle of the right line enters to a gap . ]    . for @xmath25 , the waiting time @xmath26",
    "however , as @xmath27 increases , @xmath5 can increase to astronomical values . ]",
    "consider the time - dependent probability @xmath28 that at time @xmath3 , @xmath2 vehicles are between a given car and the narrowing in the left line .",
    "let us also denote by @xmath24 the probability that a car from the right line enters into a moving hole .",
    "the appropriate master equation is    @xmath29    the first term on the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "is related to all possible events which prevent our car in the left line to move .",
    "this can happen at each of @xmath2 positions of the gap ; yet , once occupied , the gap disappears .",
    "the second term is related to a successful move of our vehicles from the @xmath30-th position to the @xmath2-th position .",
    "this needs the passive reaction of all @xmath31 vehicles , which can be realized in only one way .",
    "summing up the first term , we get    @xmath32    the mean waiting time can be calculated as    @xmath33    as it measures the current of probability of vehicles through the narrowing at time @xmath3 , summarized over @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the time dependence of the probability @xmath34 that our vehicle appears just before the narrowing . the mean waiting time",
    "@xmath5 , calculated numerically for different @xmath2 and @xmath23 , is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that once @xmath25 , the waiting time is just @xmath26 . yet , for small @xmath23 the waiting time @xmath5 appears to grow without limits .",
    "what kind of reaction for such a pessimistic result we can expect ?",
    "we have no data related directly to our problem , yet some analogy can be drawn with an expected reaction for a deterioration of conditions of a job .",
    "according to albert hirschman , active options are exit or voice , with loyalty or neglect as passive ones @xcite . for a human queue ,",
    "the active options remain valid , while it might not be possible to exit from a traffic jam .",
    "the strategy voice can be further differentiated to distinguish between an attempt to negotiate and a pure aggression .",
    "+ coming back to the option of inference from the context , we note that yet another option is to reject the result .",
    "one can say to himself : if it had looked like that , someone would have reacted. this can be chosen more likely and is more justified , because - according to our assumptions - the inference has been based on an incomplete information .",
    "however , other factors can play a role at least not less important . as indicated above , when we are placed at the end of a queue which is apparently too long to provide goods , we are prone to an unjustified optimism @xcite .",
    "this experimental result coincides with a more recent research of attitudes of beginners in business : they are found to see only positive examples and to have an illusion of control of their life @xcite .",
    "it remains not clear , if this optimism is induced by the situation or if the beginners in business are optimistic by their nature .",
    "+ summarizing , we have considered two examples of model queues within the more general frames of the problem of inference from very limited data .",
    "we demonstrated that for both models , it may happen that the evaluated waiting time is extremely long . in our opinion , in everyday life such evaluations are usually verified on the basis of context . in reality",
    "both social situations provide a cognitive infrastructure in which according to krueger @xcite we are able to address personal attitudes , social norms , self - efficacy and collective efficacy . on the contrary , this kind of results can influence actions of ai systems , where an inference from context is not readily available .",
    "we are grateful to grzegorz haraczyk and wojciech somczyski for pointing out refs .",
