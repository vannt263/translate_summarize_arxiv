    "none of the reported anisotropies has been attributed to tunable electric fields , where we find @xmath80 for rotation with respect to the @xmath81-field axis . for ge / si core - shell nanowires , hu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported an effective @xmath0-factor of @xmath82 measured with the @xmath27-field aligned along the nanowire axis @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite have measured @xmath1 for different transitions ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 , @xmath49 was here aligned perpendicular to the nanowire .",
    "both values are consistent with our measurements .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    a @xmath0-factor anisotropy can in principle be related to the crystal direction @xcite . in our probably @xmath84110@xmath85-oriented device ,",
    "we have observed a different anisotropy for holes states most probably originating from higher subbands , while we have observed qualitatively the same anisotropy in a second device tuned to the few - hole regime .",
    "therefore we have strong evidence that the @xmath0-factor anisotropy observed here is rather related to an electric - field induced mixing between the lowest - lying subbands as discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    maier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite theoretically investigated the @xmath0-factor in ge - si core - shell nanowires .",
    "they assumed elongated quantum dots , i.e. @xmath86 , which is very well fulfilled in our device , where @xmath87  nm and @xmath88  nm .",
    "they predicted the @xmath0-factor to be highly anisotropic , with @xmath0 indeed being quenched along the nanowire axis , and a maximum @xmath0-factor perpendicular to the nanowire .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our measurements .",
    "moreover , they predicted a lower @xmath0-factor at finite electric fields .",
    "in particular , their calculations showed a more effective diminishment for @xmath89 than for @xmath90 .",
    "also this agrees well with our findings .",
    "show that this tunability of the @xmath0-factor with electric fields is caused by the effective coupling of different subbands through these electric fields and the mixed heavy - hole light - hole nature of the individual subbands .",
    "the combination leads to a very pronounced spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) introduced as the ` direct rashba spin - orbit interaction ' @xcite because of its resemblance of the standard rashba soi and the fact that it is a leading - order process not suppressed by the band gap and thus expected to be 10 - 100 times stronger than the standard rashba soi for geometries similar to our device .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    also quantitatively our measurements agree very well with the predictions regarding the @xmath0-factor quenching along the nanowire axis .",
    "the @xmath0-factor suppression by the electric field is less pronounced than the calculations .",
    "this can be explained by differences in the exact geometry of the wires , the quantum dot not being in the single - hole regime , and the fact that our device is operated at significantly higher electric fields than assumed by maier _",
    "et al_.    [ [ section-17 ] ]    let us now briefly discuss the implications of these results for quantum computation applications .",
    "a main obstacle for spin - based qubits is the fast coherent manipulation of the spin state . in principle",
    "this can be done with a pulsed high - frequency ( hf ) magnetic field , but this is technologically very challenging .",
    "our results imply that it is not only possible to use pulsed hf electric fields as also used in other systems with significant soi @xcite , but with continuous hf electric fields while tuning the qubit in and out of resonance by changing the static electric field , e.g. , through a combination of top and bottom gates .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated control over the hole occupancy in a ge - si core - shell nanowire quantum dot over 60 charge transitions .",
    "the effective @xmath0-factor has been found to be highly anisotropic with respect not only to the nanowire axis but also the electric - field direction . in particular",
    "we have found excellent qualitative agreement between our measurements and theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "this opens the way to controlled manipulation of the spin - state with a continuous high - frequency electric field , a major technological advancement .",
