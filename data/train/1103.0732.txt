    "a periodic variation of a system parameter leads to the exponential growth of certain modes of the system .",
    "this phenomenon is known as parametric resonance and occurs in a wide variety of systems such as classical oscillators , nonlinear optics , system governed by non - linear schrdinger equations and in hamiltonian chaotic systems .",
    "parametric excitations in the form of faraday waves , were observed in a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) by periodically modulating the radial trap frequency @xcite .",
    "the modulation of the radial trap frequency leads to a periodic modulation of the density of the cloud in time , which in turn leads to a periodic change in the nonlinear interactions .",
    "this leads to the parametric excitation of longitudinal sound - like waves ( faraday waves ) in the direction of weak confinement . from the theoretical side ,",
    "parametric excitations have already been investigated by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "a bec in an optical lattice potential exhibits parametric excitations when the depth of the optical lattice potential is periodically modulated in time .",
    "these parametric excitations correspond to an exponential growth of the population of counter - propagating bogoliubov excitations @xcite .",
    "when the frequency of oscillation of the scattering length is an even multiple of the radial or axial natural oscillation frequency , respectively , the radial or axial oscillation of the condensate exhibits resonance @xcite .",
    "parametric resonances in a bec under periodic oscillations of the position of a quadratic plus quartic trap have also been predicted @xcite .",
    "experimentally , stferle et al .",
    "@xcite measured the excitation spectrum of the condensate in the superfluid regime by time modulating the optical lattice depth .",
    "the width of the expanding cloud after it is released from the trap is taken as a measure of the excitation energy .",
    "the observed resonances in these experiments were explained by the generation of parametric amplification of bogoliubov states and the subsequent nonlinear dynamics , which leads to the broadening of the momentum distribution @xcite .    in this work , we study parametric resonances in an elongated cigar - shaped bec in a combined harmonic trap and a time dependent optical lattice by using numerical and analytical techniques . in order to distinguish the present work from parametric resonances studied earlier , we always consider the case when the frequency of oscillation of the optical lattice depth is not equal to the axial or radial natural oscillation frequency . we show that there exists a relative competition between the harmonic trap which tries to spatially localize the bec and the time varying optical lattice which tries to delocalize the bec .",
    "this competition gives rise to parametric resonances ( collapse and revival in the oscillations of the bec width ) .",
    "parametric resonances disappear when one of the competing factors i.e strength of harmonic trap or the strength of optical lattice dominates . on one hand ,",
    "parametric instabilities ( exponential growth of bogoliubov modes ) arise for large variations in the strength of the optical lattice and on the other hand , stable oscillations of the condensate width occurs when the harmonic trap strength dominates .",
    "we employ a variational technique @xcite to derive analytical predictions for the parametric resonances .",
    "the analytical results qualitatively agree with the numerical results .",
    "we consider an elongated cigar shaped bose - einstein condensate(bec ) of @xmath0 two - level @xmath1 atoms in the @xmath2 state with mass @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 of the @xmath5 transition of the @xmath6 line of @xmath1 in combined harmonic and optical lattice potential . in order to create an elongated bec",

    "the normalization condition of the order parameter is @xmath11 .",
    "the confining potential for the bec is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 represents the trapping frequencies in the respective directions .",
    "we have assumed that harmonic potential in the x - direction is superimposed by a 1d ol potential of the form    @xmath14    where v is the amplitude of the ol potential . @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 is the wavelength of the laser beam used to create 1d ol potential .",

    "@xmath19 shows very weak and @xmath20 shows very strong harmonic confinement .",
    "@xmath21 is the frequency of external perturbation at any time t in the time dependent 1d ol potential with the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested in studying the effect of time dependent potential on the dynamics of the cigar - shaped bec . taking the y , z directions to be the transverse and x as longitudinal we assume the confinement in the transverse directions to be sufficiently strong @xmath23 so that the transverse degrees of freedom @xmath24 freeze out and the condensate motion gets confined to the longitudinal direction only and the bec is quasi 1d .    to solve the above problem numerically , we first make the eqn.[gp_1]dimensionless through a set of linear transformations @xmath25 which we will use throughout the paper .",
    "after these transformations eqn .
