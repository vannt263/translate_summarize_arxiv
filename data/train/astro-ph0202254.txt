    "in only ten years , the study of gamma - ray bursts has grown from a narrow specialty involving a small group of high - energy astronomers to a mainstream field of research that impacts nearly all topics in astronomy .",
    "this change resulted primarily from observational advances made with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ , and the discovery of x - ray afterglows and long wavelength counterparts made possible with the beppo - sax experiment .",
    "the batse results showed that the angular distribution of grbs on the sky is isotropic , and that the grb size distribution exhibits a strong flattening for faint bursts @xcite .",
    "this behavior follows from a cosmological origin of grb sources , with the decline in the number of faint bursts due to cosmic expansion .",
    "follow - up x - ray observations with the narrow field instruments on beppo - sax has permitted redshift determinations that firmly establish the distance scale to the sources of @xmath3 s duration grbs , which are those to which beppo - sax is sensitive .",
    "the redshifts of nearly 20 grbs are now known , with the mean redshift near unity and the largest measured redshift at @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding distances imply apparent isotropic @xmath0-ray energy releases in the range from @xmath5-@xmath6 ergs .",
    "recent results suggest that grb emissions are strongly beamed , so that the total energy release is actually in the neighborhood of @xmath7 ergs , corresponding to the typical total energies released in the kinetic outflow of a supernova",
    ". delayed reddened enhancements detected in the optical light curves of a few grbs could also be a consequence of a supernova emission component .",
    "if the beaming results are correct , then many more sources of grbs exist than are implied through direct statistical studies of detected grbs",
    ". the implied rate of both aligned and misdirected grb sources begins to approach the expected rate of type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) . these and other lines of evidence indicate that grbs are related to a type of supernova .",
    "this review of the theory of grbs briefly touches on some of the central questions in contemporary grb studies . after summarizing the prompt @xmath0-ray luminous and delayed afterglow observations of grbs ,",
    "detections of x - ray emission line and absorption features , and some related phenomenology , the redshift distribution is presented .",
    "these redshifts are obtained from absorption lines in the optical afterglow , spectroscopy of the host galaxies and , in a few cases , from x - ray line observations .",
    "given the redshift , the directed energy releases per unit solid angle can be derived .",
    "the theoretical basis for the fireball / blast wave model is outlined , and numerical calculations derived from the model are presented . according to the blast - wave model ,",
    "a central source ejects an expanding relativistic shell of particles . accelerated electrons radiate synchrotron photons to produce the long wavelength x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows , as well as the soft @xmath0-ray emission emitted in the prompt phase ( although arguments have also been made for a compton origin of this emission ) .",
    "by contrast , a synchrotron self - compton origin may explain the @xmath8 mev emission detected with egret from a handful of grbs in the prompt phase , and from grb 940217 in the afterglow phase .",
    "the photons received during the prompt phase are emitted closest to the central source ; therefore a correct theory of the origin of the prompt emission reveals properties of the central engine .",
    "we contrast an internal shock / colliding shell model with an external shock model for the prompt @xmath0-ray emission . beaming breaks in afterglow light curves can be used to deduce the collimation angle , and hence the true energetics of the grb source .",
    "the most popular current model for the central sources of long - duration grbs is the hypernova / collapsar model , where an evolved , massive star s central core collapses to a black hole while accreting material at the rate of @xmath9- a few solar masses per second .",
    "the coalescence of neutron stars and black holes has been less successful as a model for the long - duration grbs because host galaxy evidence indicate that a massive star origin is more likely ; a compact - object coalescence model may still apply to the short duration grbs .",
    "the supranova model of vietri and stella invokes a two - step collapse process where the core collapse of a massive star forms a rotationally stabilized neutron star following a supernova explosion .",
    "the neutron star later collapses to form a black hole .",
    "this model has several advantages over the hypernova / collapsar model to account for the evidence of beaming and the x - ray absorption and line observations , including the presence of a highly enriched circumburster medium ( cbm ) , and a uniform energy scale set by the mass of the neutron star .",
    "some important issues in grb cosmology are mentioned , though the remainder of this review focuses on the role that grbs may play in cosmic - ray origin studies .",
    "grb sources release energy into an @xmath10 galaxy such as the milky way at the time averaged rate of @xmath11 ergs s@xmath12 , which is nearly equal to the cosmic ray power into our galaxy .",
    "relativistic blast waves can accelerate particles well beyond the knee of the cosmic - ray spectrum through second - order processes , overcoming difficulties that first - order fermi acceleration faces to accelerate cosmic rays to energies above the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum in sne .",
    "if the beaming results are correct , then grbs occur in our galaxy at the rate of once every several thousand years , suggesting that grbs are associated with a subset of sne .",
    "finally , we consider high - energy neutrino production from grbs , and show how high - energy neutrino and gamma - ray observations of grbs can discriminate between an internal and external shock model for the prompt gamma - ray emission , with important implications for central engine theory .",
    "because the emphasis here is on theory , we can only briefly summarize the basic features of grb observations and phenomenology ( for a recent review of the observations , see @xcite ) .",
    "grbs are brief flashes of radiation at hard x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray energies that display a wide variety of time histories , though in @xmath13 25% of the cases a characteristic single - pulse profile is observed , consisting of a rapid rise followed by a slower decay @xcite .",
    "grbs were first detected at soft @xmath0-ray energies with wide field - of - view instruments .",
    "peak soft @xmath0-ray fluxes reach hundreds of photons @xmath14 s@xmath12 in rare cases .",
    "the batse instrument is sensitive in the 50 - 300 kev band , and provides the most extensive data base of grb observations during the prompt phase .",
    "it searches for grbs by examining strings of data for @xmath15 enhancements above background on the 64 ms , 256 ms , and 1024 ms time scales , and triggers on grbs as faint as @xmath16 ph @xmath14 s@xmath12 , corresponding to energy flux sensitivities @xmath17 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath12 .    -0.4 in   peaks are plotted on the bottom panel .",

    "it has emerged as the standard model to interpret grb prompt and afterglow emissions ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest version of the standard blast wave model involves a spherical , uncollimated explosion taking place in a uniform surrounding medium .",
    "a relativistic pair fireball is formed when an explosion deposits a large amount of energy into a compact volume .",
    "the pressure of the explosion causes the fireball to expand , with the thermal kinetic energy of the explosion being transformed into directed kinetic energy due to strong adiabatic cooling of particles in the comoving frame @xcite . because of the thomson coupling between the particles and photons ,",

    "a forward shock is formed when the expanding shell accelerates the external medium , and a reverse shock is formed due to deceleration of the cold shell .",

    "particle acceleration at the reverse shock is unimportant when the reverse shock is nonrelativistic , which occurs when @xmath56    the unique feature of grbs is that the coasting lorentz factor @xmath57 may reach values from hundreds to thousands .",
    "by contrast , type ia and ii sne have ejecta speeds that are in the range of @xmath58-@xmath59 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the relativistic motion of the radiating particles introduce many interesting effects in grb emissions that must be properly taken into account .",

    "the blast - wave width depends on the duration of the explosion and the spreading of the blast - wave particles .",
    "because sub - second structure is regularly observed in grb light curves , the central engine must be @xmath72 lt - s , and is probably much thinner in view of 1 - 10 ms variability observed in some grbs @xcite .",
    "we denote this length scale by @xmath73 cm .",
    "the shell will spread radially in the comoving frame by an amount @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the available comoving time and @xmath76 is the spreading speed .",

    "as the blast wave expands , it sweeps up material from the surrounding medium to form an external shock @xcite . in a colliding wind scenario ,",
    "the blast wave intercepts other portions of the relativistic wind @xcite .",
    "protons captured by the expanding blast wave from the cbm will have total energy @xmath81 in the fluid frame , where @xmath82 is the proton mass .",

    "one factor of @xmath52 represents the increase of external medium density due to length contraction , the factor ( @xmath84 ) is proportional to the kinetic energy of the swept up particles , and the factor @xmath85 is proportional to the rate at which the particle energy is swept .",
    "thus the power is @xmath86 for relativistic blast waves , and @xmath87 for nonrelativistic blast waves .",
    "this process provides internal energy available to be dissipated in the blast wave .",

    "<S> this paper presents the theoretical basis of the fireball / blast wave model , and some implications of recent results on grb source models and cosmic - ray production from grbs . </S>",
    "<S> batse observations of the prompt @xmath0-ray luminous phase , and beppo - sax and long wavelength afterglow observations of grbs are briefly summarized . </S>",
    "<S> derivation of spectral and temporal indices of an adiabatic blast wave decelerating in a uniform surrounding medium in the limiting case of a nonrelativistic reverse shock , both for spherical and collimated outflows , is presented as an example of the general theory . </S>",
    "<S> external shock model fits for the afterglow lead to the conclusion that grb outflows are jetted . </S>",
    "<S> the external shock model also explains the temporal duration distribution and clustering of peak energies in prompt spectra of long - duration grbs , from which the redshift dependence of the grb source rate density can be derived . </S>",
    "<S> source models are reviewed in light of the constant energy reservoir result of frail et al .  </S>",
    "<S> that implies a total grb energy of a few @xmath1 ergs and an average beaming fraction of @xmath2 of full sky . </S>",
    "<S> paczyski s isotropic hypernova model is ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the vietri - stella model two - step collapse process is preferred over a hypernova / collapsar model in view of the x - ray observations of grbs and the constant energy reservoir result . </S>",
    "<S> second - order processes in grb blast waves can accelerate particles to ultra - high energies . </S>",
    "<S> grbs may be the sources of uhecrs and cosmic rays with energies above the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> high - energy neutrino and @xmath0-ray observations with glast and ground - based @xmath0-ray telescopes will be crucial to test grb source models . </S>"
