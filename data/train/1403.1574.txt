    "statistical physics has got the edge over socio - economic sciences in the understanding of complex systems @xcite .",
    "this happened due to the fact that physicists were able to start from the understanding of simple phenomena via simple models and later built the complexity up together with the increasing complexity of the considered phenomena . on the other hand socio - economic sciences had to face complexity right from the start as socio - economic systems are in no way simple systems - they are intrinsically complex at many different levels at the same time .",
    "financial markets are one of the most interesting examples of such complex systems . unlike in physics we have no direct way to gain insights into the nature of microscopic interactions in financial markets ,",
    "thus the understanding of the financial market fluctuations may become rather limited and very ambiguous . yet",
    "the understanding might be improved indirectly through the further development of the complex systems approach @xcite .",
    "first of all , currently there are huge amounts of the available empirical data , which itself is attracting representatives of the experimental sciences @xcite .",
    "also there is an agent - based modeling framework , which may provide qualitative and quantitative understanding of the financial markets .",
    "the intense applications of these ideas is still ongoing @xcite and the challenge is still open .",
    "agent - based modeling has become one of the key tools , which could improve the understanding of the financial markets as well as lead to the potential applications @xcite .",
    "currently there are many differing agent - based approaches in the modeling of the financial markets .",
    "some of them aim to be as realistic as possible , yet they usually end up being too complex to posses analytical treatment .",
    "one of the most prominent examples of these kind of models is the lux - marchesi model @xcite .",
    "the more recent approaches in the similar direction consider modeling order books @xcite .",
    "other approaches , on the other hand , aim to capture the most general properties of the many complex socio - economic systems ( some of the examples include @xcite ) . though there are also some interesting approaches which combine realism and analytical tractability , e.g. feng _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have used both empirical data and trader survey data to construct agent - based and stochastic model for the financial market .",
    "looking for the ideal agent - based approach we would consider as a primary necessity to build bridges between microscopic , agent based , and macroscopic , phenomenological , modeling@xcite . following this trace of thought",
    "it would be rational to combine two origins of the noise : exogenous one , related to the information flow , and endogenous one , arising form the complex stochastic dynamics of agents .",
    "such integral view of the financial markets can be achieved only with very simple zero - intelligence agent - based models and macroscopic , phenomenological , approaches incorporating external information flow .",
    "this is the main idea of our present consideration of the financial markets .    the expected properties of such",
    "model lead us to the return fluctuations , characterized by the power law distributions and the power law autocorrelations of absolute return considered in @xcite .",
    "we investigate an agent - based herding model of the financial markets , which proves to be rather realistic and also simple enough to be analytically tractable @xcite . namely we consider a three agent states model @xcite and incorporate it into the standard model of the stock price described by the geometric brownian motion or into process with statistical feedback @xcite , exhibiting tsallis statistics .",
    "we find that the improved three state agent - based herding model reproduces the power law statistics observed in the empirical data extracted from the nyse trades and quotes database , warsaw stock exchange and nasdaq omx vilnius stock exchange .",
    "we start by discussing the possible alternatives in macroscopic and phenomenological modeling providing some insight into the possible connection to the agent - based microscopic approach .",
    "next we develop the microscopic approach by defining the herding interactions between three agent groups and incorporate it into a consistent model of the financial markets .",
    "further we couple the endogenous fluctuations of the agent system with the exogenous information flow noise incorporated in macroscopic approach and provide detailed comparison with the empirical data .",
    "finally we discuss the obtained results in the context of the proposed double stochastic model of the return in the financial markets .",
    "it is the natural peculiarity of the social systems to be treated first of all from the macroscopic and phenomenological point of view .",
    "in contrast to the natural sciences microscopic treatment of the social systems is ambiguous and hardly can be considered as a starting point for the consistent modeling .",
    "the complexity of human behavior leaves us without any opportunity to consider human agent in action as a determined dynamic trajectory .",
    "the financial markets as an example of the social behavior first of all are considered as a macroscopic system exhibiting stochastic movement of the variables such as asset price , trading volume or return @xcite . despite lack of knowledge regarding microscopic background of the financial systems there is considerable progress in stochastic modeling producing very practical applications @xcite .",
    "the standard model of stock prices , @xmath0 , referred to as geometric brownian process , is widely accepted in financial analysis @xmath1 in the above wiener process @xmath2 can be considered as an external information flow noise while @xmath3 accounts for the stochastic volatility . though one must consider the model of stock prices following geometric brownian motion as a hypothesis which has to be checked critically , this serves as a background for many empirical studies and further econometric financial market model developments .",
    "acknowledgment that analysis taking @xmath4 and @xmath3 constant have a finite horizon of application has become an important motivation for the study of the arch and garch processes @xcite as well as for the stochastic modeling of volatility @xmath3 @xcite .    we acknowledge this phenomenological approach as a good starting point for the macroscopic financial market description incorporating external information flow noise @xmath2 and we will go further by modeling volatility @xmath3 as an outcome of some agent - based herding model .",
    "the main purpose of this approach is to demonstrate how sophisticated statistical features of the financial markets can be reproduced by combining endogenous and exogenous stochasticity .",
    "here we consider only the most simple case , when @xmath3 fluctuations are slow in comparison with external noise @xmath2 . in such case",
    "the return , @xmath5 , in the time period @xmath6 can be written as a solution of eq .",

    "let us exclude here from the consideration long term price movements defined by the mean @xmath8 as we will define the dynamics of price from microscopic agent - based part of model .",

    "volatility of financial system increases when market value of the asset deviates from the fundamental value .",

    "having discussed a macroscopic view of the financial fluctuations we now switch to the microscopic consideration of the endogenous fluctuations .",
    "let us derive the system of stochastic differential equations defining the endogenous log - price fluctuations from a setup of appropriate agent groups composition .",
    "we consider a system of n heterogenous agents - market traders continually changing their trading strategies between three possible choices : fundamentalists , chartists optimists and chartists pessimists .",
    "we further develop this commonly used agent group setup @xcite by considering all transitions between three agent states to be a result of binary herding interactions between agents during their market transactions .",
    "fundamentalists are traders with fundamental understanding of the true stock value , which is commonly quantified as the stock s fundamental price , @xmath43 .",
    "we exclude from our consideration any movements of the fundamental price .",

    "the rationality of fundamental traders keeps asset price around its fundamental value as they sell when @xmath53 , and buy when @xmath54 .",
    "short term speculations cause unpredictable price movements .",
    "there is a huge variation of speculative trading strategies , so it is rational , from the statistical physics point of view , to consider these variations as statistically irrelevant .",

    "( a ) - 1 minute ; ( b ) - 3 minutes ; ( c ) - 10 minutes ; ( d ) - 30 minutes .",
    "other model parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ figure2].,width=566 ]    for such emerging markets as baltic region the intensity of stock trading is up to 50 time lower than in nyse .",
    "this makes a considerable impact on return in such short time interval as 1 minute pdf as for over 90% of time intervals no transactions are registered .",
    "consequently , one observes considerable discrepancy in pdf for low return values as main part of returns are equal to zero .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to notice that power law part of pdf and psd is in pretty good agreement with model one .",
    "mentioned discrepancy disappears with increasing @xmath6 or for the markets with a more intensive trading . some pdf discrepancy for low returns values",
    "is observed for nyse and warsaw stocks as well and this is related with some impact of discrete nature of price values measured in cents , namely on the discrete tick size .",
    "certainly , prices are smooth in the model .",
    "finally we can conclude that three state herding model of absolute return in financial markets works very well and explains general origins of power law statistics for very different markets starting from most developed to emerging .",
    "the proposed consentaneous agent - based and stochastic model of the financial markets is a result of our previous research in stochastic modeling , see references in @xcite , and agent - based modeling of herding interaction @xcite .",
    "the idea to combine two approaches comes from the properties of nonlinear stochastic differential equations generating power law statistics @xcite and possibility to derive these equations as macroscopic outcome of microscopic herding model @xcite .",
    "the possibility to reproduce power law statistical features of absolute return observed in the financial markets in such details as power spectrum with two different exponents distinguishes this approach as compromise of sophistication and simplicity .",
    "nevertheless , the main value of this model comes form its very clear microscopic background of herding interactions between agents .",
    "very general idea , which has roots in the entomological studies of ant colonies @xcite , can be adopted to build system of three agent groups acting in the financial markets .",
    "further complexity of the behavioral aspects of agents can be treated as irrelevant for the macroscopic outcome of this complex system as herding alon reproduces statistical properties .",
    "it is worth to notice that some feedback of observed return increases trading activity in the market and the degree of nonlinearity , which we account by empirical value of the exponent @xmath146 , @xcite .",
    "other model parameters are less grounded by the empirical market analysis and are defined by adjusting proposed model to the here presented statistical properties of the considered financial markets .",
    "parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 define the most fundamental tradeoff between fundamental and speculative behavior of agents in financial markets .",
    "it is clear from the defined values of the parameters , exhibiting strong asymmetry between fundamentalism and chartism , that bubbles in the financial markets can be explained just by the disappearance of the fundamental trading behavior and markets become stable when considerable part of agents return to the trading according to the fundamental values .",
    "the tradeoff between fundamental and speculative behavior is the slowest process in the model defined by adjusted parameter @xmath142 .",
    "it looks like that this long term herding process has global nature and impacts all markets in the similar way .",
    "much more rapid process defined by parameter @xmath141 describes tradeoff between choices to sell or buy and probably is more related with local stock price dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , the same value of @xmath152 appropriate for all markets and all stocks makes some surprise and probably is related with universal behavior of power spectral density .",
    "notice that value @xmath140 is higher than 1 making these rapid fluctuations symmetric and localized around equilibrium @xmath153 .    from our point of view",
    "this study based on the concepts of statistical physics contributes to the behavior finance supporting the general idea of market inefficiency @xcite as exhibits possible dominance of herding interactions over agent s rationality . in other words",
    ", rationality is too heterogeneous to resist herding tendencies .",
    "this rises the question whether markets are able to determine true values of assets or one needs other more fundamental sources of economic information .",
    "fortunately the tendencies of imitation open the new possibility that herding itself can be used to stabilize unwanted fluctuations of the financial markets @xcite .",
