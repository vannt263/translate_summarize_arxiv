    "a wide range of cosmological observations coming from different sources , including the supernovae type ia ( sne ia )  @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr )  @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) surveys  @xcite , clearly indicate that the universe is currently expanding with an accelerating rate . a fair number of models and frameworks have been proposed to account for this observed accelerated expansion .",
    "these approaches can be roughly grouped in two families . in the first ,",
    "the so - called dark energy is invoked and the underlying framework of general relativity ( gr ) is kept unchanged . in this regard , the simplest way to account for the accelerating expansion of the universe is through the introduction of a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , into einstein s field equations .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the available observational data , but it faces difficulties such as the order of magnitude of the cosmological constant and its microphysical origin . in the second family ,",
    "modifications of einstein s field equations are assumed as an alternative for describing the accelerated expansion .",
    "this latter group includes , for example , generalized theories of gravity based upon modifications of the einstein - hilbert action by taking nonlinear functions , @xmath0 , of the ricci scalar @xmath6 or other curvature invariants ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 theories can potentially be used to explain the observed accelerating expansion have given birth to a number of articles on these gravity theories , in which several features of @xmath0 gravity have been discussed  @xcite , including the stability conditions  @xcite , compatibility with solar - system tests  @xcite , energy conditions  @xcite , nonlocal causal structure  @xcite , and observational constraints from a diverse set of cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "however , although the freedom in the choice of the functional forms of @xmath0 has motivated many different suggestions of @xmath0 gravity theories , which account for the accelerating expansion and are compatible with the solar - system tests , it also gives rise to the problem of how to constrain and break the degeneracy among these gravity theories on theoretical and/or observational grounds .",
    "in this regard , observational constraints on some @xmath0 gravity from a diverse set of observations have been placed  @xcite , and tests of the cosmological viability of some specific forms of @xmath0 have been explored   @xcite .",
    "a pertinent question that arises here is whether the future dynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between @xmath0 gravity theories . in this article , to proceed further with the investigation on the potentialities , difficulties and limitations of @xmath0 gravity , we examine this question by investigating the future dynamics of friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) dust flat model in two @xmath0 gravity theories , namely the well known @xmath1 gravity , for which many results are available in the literature  @xcite , and another by a. aviles _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( abcl gravity for short ) , whose motivation comes from the cosmographic approach to @xmath0 gravity  @xcite .",
    "we show that besides being powerful for discriminating between @xmath0 gravity theories , the future dynamics technique can also be used to determine the fate of the universe in @xmath0 gravity theory .    until the discovery of the accelerating expansion virtually any textbook on cosmology describes the future dynamics of flrw pressure - free dust models as follows .",
    "it expands forever if it has an euclidean or hyperbolic spatial geometry , and expands and eventually recollapses if it has a spherical spatial geometry .",
    "however , the discovery of the accelerating expansion made apparent that these simple future forecasts had to be modified , since the negative - pressure dark energy component , invoked to account for the acceleration , plays a crucial role in the evolution of the universe .",
    "indeed , the dark energy ( de ) is usually described by the equation - of - state parameter @xmath7 , which is the ratio of the de pressure to its density .",
    "a value @xmath8 is required for cosmic acceleration .",
    "when @xmath9 the de density decreases with the scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "however , if @xmath11 the dark energy density becomes infinite in a finite - time , driving therefore the universe to a future finite - time singularity , called big rip  @xcite .",
    "afterwards it was determined that this is not the only possible doomsday of a dark energy dominated universe .",
    "it may , for example , come to an end in a sudden singularity  @xcite , a big freeze doomsday  @xcite , or a little rip  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also determine that even if we do not invoke a dark energy component with @xmath2 one still has pressure - free dust solution with a big rip , if gravity deviates from general relativity via @xmath3 .",
    "finally , by using the future dynamics scheme of this paper , we further present an example of flrw dust solution in which the ghost - like regimes ( @xmath12 do not necessarily lead to singularity gravity was also considered in ref .",
    "their approaches are different from ours since they have considered perfect fluid matter source with @xmath13 , while we consider simply a pressure - free dust .",
    "furthermore , our analysis is numerical while theirs is not . ] .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ basics ] we give a brief review of @xmath0 gravity theories , derive the field equations for the flat flrw metric with dust matter content , state the initial conditions for the dynamical evolutions , and present the future dynamics in the context of the general relativity theory . in sec .",
    "[ abcl - sec ] we introduce the abcl  @xcite lagrangian , develop the necessary technique for solving the dynamical equations , and derive our numerical results regarding the abcl @xmath0 gravity . in sec .",
    "[ rn ] we use our method to study the polynomial lagrangian @xmath0 gravity and make a comparative analysis of these theories .",
    "final remarks and main conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in this section we briefly review the @xmath0 gravity , derive the field equations for the flat flrw metric with dust matter content , state the initial conditions for all numerical analyses of this paper , and present the future dynamics for the particular einstein s gravity theory for later comparison with the dynamics in other gravity theories .",
    "we begin by recalling that the action that defines an @xmath0 gravity theory can be written as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the determinant of the metric @xmath18 , @xmath0 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath6 , and @xmath19 the standard action for the matter fields . varying this action with respect to the metric",
    "we obtain the field equations @xmath20 where here and in what follows primes denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath22 these field equations reduce to the einstein equations with the cosmological constant , @xmath5 , term .",
    "two important constraints , often used to simplify the calculations , come from the fact that the covariant divergence of both sides of eq .",
    ", is null .",
    "this implies that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components of the field equations give rise to the following constraints @xmath25 clearly , eq .",
    "is identically satisfied , while the constraint given by eq .   must be fulfilled throughout time evolution .",
    "we shall use this fact as a way of checking the accuracy of the numerical integration of the remaining equations of the dynamical system in the numerical analyses of the following sections .    in this work we focus on the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , @xmath26 which is supported by the recent observations  @xcite , and is consistent with the standard inflationary models .",
    "thus , the non vanishing component of the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar can be written in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the over - dot denotes derivative with respect to the time @xmath29 .",
    "since we are interested in dust of density @xmath30 with zero pressure ( @xmath31 ) then we have @xmath32 where here and in what follows the subscript zero denotes present - day values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "taking into account equations   the field equations reduce to @xmath33 @xmath34 one can easily show that eq .",
    "is nothing but the constraint eq .  , which for the dust flat flrw models takes the form @xmath35 which is in a suitable form for checking the accuracy of the numerical integration of the dynamical eq .   for the @xmath0 gravity theories we are concerned with in this paper",
    ".values of the cosmological parameters used as initial conditions in the numerical integrations . as a suitable choice of units ,",
    "the length is the @xmath36 , the time unit @xmath37 and the mass unit is chosen as @xmath38 , so that in these units the speed of light @xmath39 , and newton s constant is @xmath40 .",
    "the values of the cosmological parameters , deceleration and jerk parameters , are taken from the planck results  @xcite from ref .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to study the future dynamics for the spatially flat flrw dust models one needs to choose initial conditions for the numerical integration . in this work",

    "[ table1 ] we collect together the values of the cosmological parameters we shall employ in our numerical analyses .",

    "the field equations and eq .",
    "reduce , respectively , to @xmath45    the left panel in figure  [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of @xmath46 for spatially flat flrw dust model in the einstein theory , where initial conditions given in table  [ table1 ] were employed in the numerical calculations .",
    "this panel also shows a de sitter asymptotic behavior for @xmath46 for a non vanishing cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "the right panel shows the constraint equation  , providing an assess of the reliability of the numerical integration .",
    "in this section we shall study the future dynamic of the spatially flat flrw dust model in the @xmath0 gravity recently suggested by a. aviles _ et al . _",

    "regardless of the values of these parameters for this theory one has @xmath52 where @xmath53 and similar notation is used for higher order derivatives .",
    "in addition to the constraints   and  , which are required to ensure that both einstein s theory and newton s constant are recovered in the lowest order , we shall take into account that @xmath54 , which is a condition to avoid the presence of ghosts  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the conditions  also insure that and reduce to the friedmann equations in the lower order .    in order to study the dynamics",
    "we will need    @xmath55    before proceeding to the numerical analysis for this gravity theory , we note that due care ought to be taken in using the initial conditions since @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "note that in equations   and the higher derivatives of the scalar factor are multiplied by @xmath58 .",

    "when @xmath56 locally , at @xmath57 we have an entirely different set of differential equations obtained by   and  . in what follows , to deal with this difficulty we first assume that the solution possesses a taylor expansion about @xmath57 up to second order .",
    "then we substitute this expansion into the field equations   and   in an order by order manner , which results in a perturbative solution up to some order .",
    "second , instead of assuming the initial condition exactly at @xmath57 , the initial condition is taken at @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) through this perturbative scheme , for which now @xmath62 .    to carry out the outlined perturbative procedure , it is required to distinguish two different regimes in establishing the initial condition ( @xmath63 ) , namely one when at @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and another when @xmath64 , @xmath66 . in the following we shall treat separately these two cases .      since for the abcl gravity theory @xmath68 , in order to find a suitable form for the field equations within a perturbative scheme ,",

    "otherwise , if @xmath75 at @xmath57 , then the initial condition is chosen for @xmath29 near @xmath76 , so that we can be sure that @xmath77 and the dynamics is directly described by eqs .   and  .",
    "in this case , instead of taking @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 the initial conditions are chosen at @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath83 satisfy the relations . we note that according to eqs .",
    "the initial value @xmath79 ought to obey the constraint @xmath84    the left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows a representative numerical future dynamics of spatially flat flrw dust model in the abcl gravity theory with @xmath85 . in this case , as indicated by @xmath86 , the universe would present a noteworthy expanding phase after an initial future decelerating period .",
    "the right panel in this figure shows the constraint @xmath87 , given in eq .  , fluctuates randomly and increases but is always smaller than @xmath88 , which is a strong indication of the correctness of the numerical solution .    regarding the choice of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 used to find the numerical future dynamics solution , it is important to point out that the independence of equations  allows some freedom in their choice .",
    "although a more general phase space analysis , with its associated attractors , would be necessary to determine every possible future dynamics solution , here we have restricted our analysis to a set of values which are consistent with the present - day constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this choice of values was also motivated by a similar procedure used in the study of the polynomial @xmath0 gravity , which we study in details in the section  [ rn ] .",
    "the condition @xmath90 can be achieved in the abcl @xmath0 gravity provided that the constraint @xmath91 holds .",
    "now , similarly to the previous section we assume that the solution can be expanded in a taylor series @xmath57 up to second order",

    "the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] makes clear that the constraint on @xmath103 [ eq .",

    "we also show the behavior of the constraint @xmath103 , which exhibits fluctuations around zero with rather small amplitudes , making apparent the degree of confidence of the numerical calculations . for this particular value of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and initial conditions as given by planck team , the de sitter analytical vacuum solution obtained by solving eq .",
    "gives @xmath118 , in rather good agreement with the asymptotic values shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is possible to show this solution is an attractor over this phase space region , with @xmath102 , as is also the case for the example depicted before in figure  [ fig3 ] .         as for the @xmath119 case ,",
    "many initial conditions lead to a big rip singularity .",
    "this is a curvature singularity in the sense it can not be removed by a coordinate transformation . as an example , we show in figure  [ fig6 ] the time evolution of the hubble parameter of the dust flat flrw model for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , chosen by taking into account right panel of figure  [ fig4 ] . in this case , the analytical vacuum solution to the field equation gives @xmath122 .",
    "it is also possible to show this solution is a repellor in this phase space region , rendering the divergent evolution shown in figure [ fig6 ] an expected feature , complemented by our verification that it presents @xmath123 asymptotically .",
    "as indicated by the right panel of figure  [ fig6 ] , the numerical constraint @xmath103 noticeably increases as the solution approaches the physical singularity , which is expected from the outset , and then the numerical solution must be truncated .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the future dynamics shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , for abcl gravity , with that of figure  [ fig6 ] , for @xmath124 with @xmath119 .",
    "the dynamic depicted by figure  [ fig6 ] is a typical example of the run away evolution that suddenly ends in a big rip singularity .",
    "this evolution is usually understood in terms of the ghost - like behavior due to its transition to a regime where @xmath123 .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig2 ] presents another runaway solution , that also develops a ghost - driven regime , but with no sudden singularity within the accuracy of the numerical analysis .",
    "thus , even when @xmath123 the evolution in one theory ( abcl gravity ) presents the remarkable property of smoothing out the expected divergence .",
    "these different behaviors make apparent the richness of possible evolutions in the context of @xmath0 gravity theories .",
    "we can further examine the connection between big rip singularities and ghost - like regimes ( @xmath123 ) through another example .",
    "in fact , by taking the same values for the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath107 used for figure  [ fig6 ] along with a slightly different value for the hubble parameter ( @xmath125 , in units of table  [ table1 ] ) , we have calculated the future dynamics of the flrw dust flat models shown in figure [ fig7 ] . for this case , since @xmath126 and @xmath127 , from eq .",
    "one has the ricci scalar tends to zero , and thus @xmath128 .",
    "this evolution illustrates a case where , in a limit strongly associated to ghost - dominated regimes ( @xmath129 ) , the solution actually evolves simply to minkowski spacetime . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this interesting dynamical behavior has not been highlighted so far in the literature .",
    "it also illustrates how a direct association of big rip singularities , or even run away solutions , with a ghost - like regime of the field equations can be misleading in the framework of @xmath0 theories .",
    "there has been a great deal of recent papers on @xmath0 gravity motivated by the attempts to explain the current cosmic acceleration with no need of invoking a dark energy component . despite the arbitrariness in the choice of different functional forms of @xmath0 , which call for ways of constraining the possible @xmath0 gravity theories on physical grounds , several features of these gravity theories",
    "have been discussed in a number of recent articles . in this paper",
    "we have proceeded further with the investigation of potentialities and limitations of @xmath0 gravity theories by examining whether the future dynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between @xmath0 gravity theories . to this end , by taking the recent constraints on the cosmological parameters made by the planck team , we have performed a detailed numerical study of the future dynamic of spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust flat models in the framework of two gravity theories .",
    "as a first result , we have shown that besides being powerful for discriminating between @xmath0 gravity theories , the future dynamics numerical technique introduced in this paper can also be used to determine the fate of the universe in the framework of these @xmath0 gravity theories .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] collects together the results of the future dynamics numerical analyses of the flrw dust flat models in several different cases .",

    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows that , although with differences for @xmath141 , the ultimate fate of the universe is a de sitter model ( with slightly different hubble constant ) for the cases @xmath130 , @xmath134 and @xmath136 .",
    "clearly the cases @xmath142 evolves to minkowski space whereas the case @xmath143 develops singularity .",

    "the development of a big rip singularity as shown in curve ( e ) of figure  [ fig8 ] is consistent with the results found in the literature for @xmath1 with negative @xmath108 , and are generally associated with ghost - like regimes ( @xmath123 ) . in this regard , an interesting outcome of our analyses is the evolution given by curve ( b ) of figure [ fig8 ] , where another ghost - driven regime follows a smooth accelerated evolution with no associated singularity .",
    "along the same lines , we also note the interesting case presented by curve ( f ) in the same figure .",
    "this is a solution evolving to minkowski spacetime for @xmath58 negative and unbounded .",
    "thus , our numerical analyses suggest that ghost - like regimes ( @xmath123 ) do not necessarily lead to singularities .    the discovery of the cosmological expansion along with earlier theoretical investigations concerning spatially homogeneous and isotropic models by friedmann and lematre sparked the first scientific studies on the future dynamics and the ultimate fate of the universe in the framework of einstein s theory of gravitation . it was shown that if the matter content of the universe is a pressure - free dust , then the future of the universe would depend only on the sign of the spatial curvature .",
    "it would expand forever if it has an euclidean or hyperbolic spatial geometry , and would expand and eventually recollapse if it has a spherical spatial geometry .",
    "these predictions may be found in virtually any textbook on cosmology , but the discovery of the accelerating expansion , through type ia supernovae observations , made apparent that this simple future forecast for the universe does not work anymore , since the negative - pressure dark energy ( de ) component , invoked to account for the acceleration , plays a crucial role in the evolution of the universe .",
    "indeed , the dark energy is usually described by the equation - of - state parameter @xmath144 which is the ratio of the de pressure to its density ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a value @xmath8 is required for cosmic acceleration .",
    "when @xmath9 the de density decreases with the scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "however , it has been shown that if @xmath11 the dark energy density becomes infinite in a finite - time , @xmath145 ( say ) , driving therefore the universe to a future finite - time singularity called big rip in which when @xmath146  @xcite .",
    "afterwards , it was understood that this is not the only possible doomsday of a dark energy dominated universe .",
    "it may , for example , come to an end in a sudden singularity  @xcite , a big freeze doomsday  @xcite , or a little rip  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have examined numerically the future dynamics of the universe but , instead of assuming a dark energy component , we have assumed that gravity is governed by @xmath0 gravity theories and have kept a pressure - free dust as matter content . as a result , we have also shown that even if we do not invoke a dark energy component with @xmath2 one still can have pressure - free dust flrw flat solution with a big rip , if gravity deviates from general relativity via @xmath3 , as shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .    finally , by using the future dynamics scheme of this paper",
    ", we also show an example in which the ghost - like regimes ( @xmath12 do not necessarily lead to singularity ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "thus , the future dynamics scheme we have developed in this paper is not only a powerful tool to discriminate between @xmath0 gravity theories , but it has also permitted to shed some light on the ghost - like regime and its connection with singularities in the context of @xmath0 gravity theories .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 gravity theories provide an alternative way to explain the current cosmic acceleration without invoking dark energy matter component . </S>",
    "<S> however , the freedom in the choice of the functional forms of @xmath0 gives rise to the problem of how to constrain and break the degeneracy among these gravity theories on theoretical and/or observational grounds . in this paper to proceed further with the investigation on the potentialities , difficulties and limitations of @xmath0 gravity , we examine the question as to whether the future dynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between @xmath0 gravity theories by investigating the future dynamics of spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust flat models in two @xmath0 gravity theories , namely the well known @xmath1 gravity and another by a. aviles _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , whose motivation comes from the cosmographic approach to @xmath0 gravity . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed numerical study of the future dynamic of these flat model in these theories taking into account the recent constraints on the cosmological parameters made by the planck team . </S>",
    "<S> we show that besides being powerful for discriminating between @xmath0 gravity theories , the future dynamics technique can also be used to determine the fate of the universe in the framework of these @xmath0 gravity theories . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there emerges from our numerical analysis that if we do not invoke a dark energy component with equation - of - state parameter @xmath2 one still has dust flat flrw solution with a big rip , if gravity deviates from general relativity via @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that flrw dust solutions with @xmath4 do not necessarily lead to singularity . </S>"
