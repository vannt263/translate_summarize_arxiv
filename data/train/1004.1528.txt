    "galaxy harassment ( frequent high speed galaxy encounters , @xcite ) is believed to be an important process in driving the morphological transformation of spiral galaxies to ellipticals inside clusters .",
    "typically , the first encounters convert a normal spiral galaxy to a disturbed spiral with dramatic features drawn out from the dynamically cold gas .",
    "the spiral galaxy ngc  4254 , located in the nearby virgo cluster , is found to have a tail @xcite with neutral hydrogen ( hi ) mass @xmath8 within a distance of @xmath9 from the galaxy .",
    "this gaseous tail , without any stellar counterpart , is believed to have been produced by an act of galaxy harassment @xcite .",
    "each act of harassment has the potential to induce a burst of star formation and to change the internal properties of the galaxy , including the properties of the inter stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "here we study the effect of the harrasment on the fine scale structure of the ism .",
    "we use the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations to quantify the fine scale structure .",
    "power spectrum analysis of the hi @xmath10-cm intensity fluctuation has been widely used to probe the ism @xcite .",
    "these studies , mainly of our galaxy and its satellites , find a power law power spectrum @xmath11 with index @xmath12 in the range @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "this scale invariant power spectrum is interpreted as arising from turbulence in the ism .",
    "recently @xcite have presented a visibility based formalism for determining the power spectrum of galaxies with extremely weak hi emission .",
    "this has been applied to a sample of dwarf and spiral galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies indicate a dichotomy in @xmath12 with values @xmath5 in some galaxies and @xmath15 in others .",
    "the two values @xmath5 and @xmath15 are interpreted as arising respectively from two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensional turbulence .",
    "some support for this interpretation has been provided by analysis of the fluctuation power spectrum for ngc  1058 where a transition from 2d to 3d turbulence is observed at an angular scale corresponding to the scale height of the galaxy s disk .",
    "ngc  4254 the galaxy whose power spectrum we estimate in this paper , is a lopsided spiral galaxy ( morphological type sa(s)c ) , with an inclination of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is located at a distance of 1 mpc from the core of virgo cluster and is believed to be falling into the cluster with a relative velocity of @xmath17 @xcite . the distance to this galaxy",
    "is estimated to be 16.7 mpc @xcite ; at this distance 1@xmath18 corresponds to 81 pc .",

    "the observations had been carried out on @xmath21 march 1992 using the c configurations of the vla @xcite .",
    "the data was downloaded from the vla archive and reduced in the usual way using standard tasks in classic aips .",
    "the hi emission from ngc  4254 spans over 30 channels i.e , ( @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) from @xmath24 mhz ( @xmath25 km s@xmath26 ) to @xmath27 mhz ( @xmath28 km s@xmath26 ) of the @xmath29 channel spectral cube . a frequency width of @xmath30",
    "k hz for each channel in the data cube corresponds to the velocity resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "the continuum from the galaxy was subtracted from the data in the _ uv _ plane using the aips task uvsub . the resulting continuum",

    "@xmath35 refers to a baseline , i.e. the antenna separation projected in the plane perpendicular to the direction of observation , measured in units of the observing wavelength @xmath36 .",
    "it is common practice to express the dimensionless quantity @xmath35 in units of kilo wavelength ( k@xmath36 ) .",
    "every visibility @xmath37 is correlated with all other visibilities @xmath38 within a disk @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the angular extent of the galaxy .",
    "the correlations are averaged over different @xmath35 directions assuming that the signal is statistically isotropic in the plane of the galaxy s image . to increase the signal to noise ratio we further average the correlation in bins of @xmath41 and over all frequency channels with hi emission .",
    "the expectation value of the estimator @xmath42 is real , and it is the convolution of the hi power spectrum @xmath43 with a window function @xmath44 . the window function , which quantifies the effect of the large - scale hi distribution and the finite angular extent of the galaxy , is peaked around @xmath45 and has a width of order @xmath46 beyond which @xmath47 . analytic considerations and simulations @xcite show that beyond a baseline @xmath48 the convolution does not effect the shape of the hi power spectrum , and we may directly interpret the real part of the estimator @xmath49 as the hi power spectrum @xmath43 .",
    "the estimator @xmath49 also has a small imaginary component arising mainly from noise .",
    "the @xmath50 error - bars for the estimated power spectrum is a sum , in quadrature , of contributions from two sources of uncertainty . at small @xmath41",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the sample variance which comes from the fact that we have a finite and limited number of independent estimates of the true power spectrum . at large @xmath41",

    "figure  [ fig : powsp24 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of @xmath49 evaluated using @xmath0 channels from @xmath51 to @xmath52 which have relatively high hi emission . here",
    "the estimator @xmath49 was separately evaluated for each channel and then averaged over all @xmath0 channels to increase the signal to noise ratio . as expected from the theoretical considerations ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the imaginary part is well suppressed compared to the real part .",
    "we also estimate @xmath49 using the line free channels to test for any contribution from the residual continuum .",
    "this is found to be much smaller than the signal ( figure  [ fig : powsp24 ] ) indicating that the continuum has been adequately subtracted out .",
    "the power law @xmath53 , with @xmath2 is found to give a good fit to the hi power spectrum for the @xmath41 range @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( table  [ table : t1 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit power - law and the @xmath50 error - bar on @xmath12 were determined using @xmath56 minimization @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath57 ( distance to the galaxy ) to convert a baseline @xmath41 to a length - scale @xmath58 in the plane of the galaxy s image .",
    "the @xmath41 range @xmath54 to @xmath59 corresponds to the range of length - scales @xmath60 to @xmath61 . @xcite",
    "have broadly classified the observed turbulence in their galaxy sample as 2d turbulence at the large scales in the plane of the galaxies disk and 3d turbulence at scales smaller than the scale height of the disk .",
    "they also show that the slope of the power spectrum changes from @xmath62 to @xmath15 as one goes from 2d to 3d turbulence . for the present case",
    "the largest length - scale ( @xmath63 ) is definitely larger than the typical hi scale heights within the milky - way @xcite and in external spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus quite reasonable to conclude that the slope @xmath64 is of 2d turbulence in the plane of the galaxy s disk .",
    "the fact that we do not observe the transition to 3d turbulence , which is expected to occur at a baseline @xmath65 @xcite , allows us to place an upper limit on the galaxy s scale height @xmath66 .",
    "our present observation is another confirmation ( dutta et al 2008 , 2009a 2009b ) of the fact that spiral galaxies exhibit scale - invariant density fluctuations that extend to length - scales of @xmath67 ( eg .",
    "ngc  628 , ngc  1058 ) which is comparable to the diameter of the hi disk .",
    "while a large variety of possible energy sources like proto - stellar winds , supernovae , shocks , etc . have been proposed to drive turbulence @xcite , it is still to be seen whether these are effective on length - scales as large as @xmath68 .",

    "while gas is stripped from the outer parts , the inner part looses angular momentum and gradually collapses to the center through repeated galaxy encounters .",
    "we can selectively study different parts of ngc  4254 , whose rotation axis is tilted at @xmath69 to the line of sight , by considering different velocity channels .",
    "our analysis till now has used only the central @xmath0 channels , we now use the central @xmath70 channels ( @xmath71 ) for the subsequent analysis .",
    "we construct @xmath72 different data cubes namely a , b and c containing channels @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "we can now separately probe the north east , central and south west parts of the galaxy ( figure  [ fig : abc ] ) using these three data cubes . for each data cube",
    ", we evaluate the hi power spectrum using individual channels and then average over the channels in the respective cubes .",
    "we estimated @xmath76",
    "seperately for a , b and c and the best fit power law is obtained for @xmath77 only .",
    "we find that for each data cubes the hi power spectrum is well fit by a power law ( figure  [ fig : aps ] ) , the details being shown in table  [ table : t1 ] .",
    "we find that the slope @xmath12 is @xmath78 for a and c which probe the outer parts of the disk while it is @xmath79 in b which probes the central region . to verify that this change in slope is due to harrassment",
    ", we also consider the hi power spectrum of the spiral galaies ngc  628 and ngc  1058 @xcite which are not undergoing galaxy harassment .",
    "figure [ fig : defm ] shows the regions of the spiral galaxy ngc  628 corresponding to each of the channel range 108 - 119 ( d ) , 120 - 131 ( e ) and 132 - 143 ( f ) .",
    "we find that the power spectra of these three data cubes ( figure  [ fig:628ps ] ) all have the same slope @xmath80 , which is also similar to the slope of the central part of ngc  4254 .",
    "the results are similar for ngc  1058 and hence we do not explicitly show these here . based on this we conclude that the difference in slope between the inner and outer parts of ngc  4254 is a consequence of galaxy harassment .",
    "not only does galaxy harassment affect the global morphology of the galaxy , it also affects the fine scale structure in the ism as reflected by hi power spectrum .",
    "we note that ngc  4254 have an inclination of @xmath69 , on the other hand ngc 628 and ngc  1058 are more face - on galaxies ( inclination @xmath81 ) . in our analysis",
    "we selectively study different parts of a galaxy by considering different velocity channel ranges .",
    "however , since face - on galaxies do not have much range in radial velocity from the rotation curve , the spatial extent of hi in ngc  628 and ngc  1058 will not be very different for the three velocity channel ranges , which is unlike the case for ngc  4254 .",
    "hence it is likely that we failed to find a change of slope in ngc  628 and ngc  1058 because of this effect of inclination .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ fig : defm ] for ngc  628 , all three data cubes d , e and f have a significant contribution of hi from the outer region of ngc  628 , leading us to believe that the power spectrum has a slope of @xmath82 in the outer parts of ngc  628 .",
    "this is similar to the value of slope seen in the central parts of ngc  4254 and significantly different from the slope in the outer parts of ngc  4254 .",
    "hence it indicates an impact of harassment in ngc  4254 .",
    "further analysis of spiral galaxies with large inclination angles would possibly be able to resolve this issue .",
    "we currently do not have an understanding of how galaxy harassment caused a steepening of the hi power spectrum in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "theoretical modeling and the analysis of other virgo cluster spiral galaxies are needed for further progress in this direction .",
