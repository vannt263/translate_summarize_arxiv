    "a coloring algorithm is _ online _ if , given graph @xmath0 on vertices @xmath18 , it assigns ( irrevocably ) for each @xmath19 a color to @xmath20 that depends only on the subgraph of @xmath0 induced by seen vertices @xmath21 for example , the _ first - fit _ algorithm produces coloring @xmath22 as follows : for @xmath23 from 1 to @xmath24 , let @xmath25 be the least positive integer available , i.e. , not a member of @xmath26 the coloring produced by this algorithm depends on vertex order .",
    "for example , figures  [ f01 ]    ]    and [ f02 ]     ]    show first - fit colorings of the 4-vertex path",

    "* when a cone is too low to support its box alone , add supporting boxes .",

    "a cone marked ( b ) in figure  [ f07 ] goes below the 1-tall box at depth @xmath133 , suited to the target ratio @xmath134 that is , we place the cone high in order to keep small the number of levels in which the 1-tall box above it requires support ; but not so high as to violate the sparseness condition .",
    "in particular , if the cone is positioned @xmath135 units from the cap top , then the sparseness condition implies @xmath136 so we choose @xmath137 .",
    "the 1-tall box still requires support in 2 levels .",
    "this is addressed immediately .",
    "3 .   a 2-tall box is placed to fill the vertical gap between the bottom of box ( a ) and its cone ( b ) .",
    "we are filling the gap to satisfy the cap support condition for intervals of box ( a ) .",
    "a cone goes below box ( c ) at proper depth ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "a gap of 4 colors remains between the new cone and the 2-tall box it supports .",
    "5 .   a 1-tall box ( and cone )",
    "fits on the inside , leaving a gap of only 3 on the outside .",
    "the idea is to distribute the support of box ( c ) between two others , boxes ( e ) and ( f ) , left and right of the cone under box ( c ) .",
    "just left of box ( c ) , there is only 1 unit of `` weight '' above ( i.e. , box ( a ) ) , and yet we are at depth 8 , yielding the opportunity to add another unit of weight and still satisfy the sparseness condition .",
    "a 3-tall box fills the gap .",
    "a cone goes below .",
    "a 5-gap remains ( between cone and 3-tall box ) .",
    "a 1-tall box fits inside .",
    "a 4-tall box fills the gap .",
    "a cone goes below .",
    "a 5-gap remains .",
    "a 1-tall box fits inside .",
    "a 4-tall box fills the gap . 13 .",
    "a cone goes below .",
    "a 1-gap remains .",
    "a 1-tall box on the outside finishes the construction .",
    "can we improve this result by the same procedure with @xmath139 ?",
    "let us record the sequence @xmath140 of box heights along the outer strand , which for @xmath141 is @xmath142 .",
    "the procedure halts because the last number does not exceed its predecessor . for @xmath139",
    "the sequence is @xmath143 we can not complete the construction if the sequence increases forever .",
    "does it ?",
    "crucially , sequence @xmath144 obeys a linear recurrence .",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ f08 ] .",
    "the recurrence follows from the procedure by a comparison of depths of cones under two consecutive boxes ( @xmath145-tall and @xmath146-tall ) of the outer strand .",
    "when a box @xmath147 is placed on the inside to support the @xmath145-tall box , @xmath147 has no supporting box of its own .",
    "so the cone under @xmath147 is at the same depth @xmath148 as the cone under the @xmath145-tall box . to satisfy the sparseness condition for @xmath149 the total height of boxes above the cone under @xmath147 must be at most @xmath150 and in the procedure we choose equality . above @xmath147",
    "is a @xmath151-tall box .",
    "so @xmath147 is @xmath152-tall .",
    "similarly a @xmath153-tall box supports the @xmath146-tall box from the inside . comparing cone depths , @xmath154 so heights of boxes of the outer strand are given by the sequence @xmath155 for @xmath156 what determines the eventual behavior of such sequences ?",
    "the discriminant @xmath157 of the characteristic polynomial @xmath158 of the recurrence is negative when @xmath141 and positive when @xmath159 as we will see when we refine the construction , such distinctions are important to sequence behavior .",
    "meanwhile we may improve the bound @xmath132 by considering noninteger @xmath49 as lusarek @xcite did when he obtained @xmath160 observe that if each number in figure  [ f07 ] is doubled , say , the result is again a cap .",
    "therefore we may use ( temporarily ) rational numbers instead of integers for box heights and depths .",
    "@xmath161 has a root @xmath162 the best we can do with the rational generalization of the method of chrobak and lusarek is @xmath163 .",
    "( of course @xmath164 is irrational , but a sequence of rationals increasing to @xmath164 establishes @xmath165 )",
    "in the previous section , our attempt to obtain a lower bound @xmath38 failed due to an unhalting procedure . yet",
    "a certain resource was not fully exploited : the cap grew only 1 box inward .",
    "that is , boxes of the outer strand had 1 or 2 supporting boxes , but inner boxes ( e ) , ( h ) , and ( k ) of figure  [ f07 ] had no supporters .",
    "we will enable more growth inward by a construction that generalizes the one of chrobak and lusarek .",
    "let us reformulate the cap conditions as they apply to our construction .",
    "1 .   intervals are bundled into boxes , where a box of height @xmath131 represents identical intervals in @xmath131 consecutive levels .",
    "distinct boxes meet pairwise in sets of area 0 .",
    "intervals bundled in a common box share a cone .",
    "emptiness _ : each box has a cone beneath it , representing a void for an older wall .",
    "sparseness _ : each vertical line segment from cap top to cone top ( note : cones have positive width , so for a given cone , there are infinitely many such line segments ) meets boxes in portion at most @xmath94 of its length .",
    "if @xmath135 is the distance of cone top from cap top , and @xmath166 ( for _ weight above _ the cone ) is the total length of the part that meets boxes , then the sparseness condition is @xmath167 3 .   _",
    "support _ : each box is supported by at most two others below it that cover the vertical extent from its bottom to its cone top .",
    "depths of box features ( i.e. , tops and bottoms ) need not be integral , but are rational . they can be made integral by scaling later .",
    "this defines a _",
    "rational cap_. our construction is less direct than that of chrobak and lusarek in two ways .",
    "first , there is no rational cap with @xmath139 ( see section  [ nocap ] ) .",
    "instead we construct a sequence of rational caps with @xmath168 second , each rational cap is made in a finite sequence of quasi - cap constructions .",
    "the construction of the @xmath169-cap of chrobak and lusarek ( figure  [ f07 ] ) begins with twin 1-tall boxes at the top , one supporting the other .",
    "apart from the difference in vertical position of the twin 1-tall boxes , the left and right sides are mirror images .",
    "consequently , the lower 1-tall box has at most one supporter .",
    "this supporter ( if any ) is the _ key box _ , or the box in _",
    "key position_. in figure  [ f07 ] the key box is a 2-tall box labeled ( c ) .",
    "such a rational cap ( with twin 1-tall boxes , symmetry , and at most 1 supporter of the lower twin ) is _ normal .",
    "_    in a normal rational cap , the purpose of a key box is to support a 1-tall box , so the top of the key box meets the bottom of the 1-tall box .",
    "a _ quasicap _ is a normal rational cap , except that a quasicap always has a key box , and the top of the key box may fall short , leaving a vertical gap ( as in figures [ f09 ] and [ f10 ] ) .",
    "further , we require of a quasicap that apart from the twin 1-tall boxes , no box has its top higher than the top of the key box .    -tall box in the key position ( bold ) . when @xmath170 there is a gap between this box and the 1-tall box it should support",
