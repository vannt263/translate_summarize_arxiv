    "the discovery of topologically non - trivial states of matter opens up a new realm of knowledge for fundamental condensed matter physics . unlike conventional materials , these  topological insulators \" exhibit metallic surface states that are protected by time reversal symmetry , while maintaining an insulating bulk electronic structure",
    "this leads to a variety of novel properties including odd number of surface dirac fermions , strict prohibition of back - scattering , etc . , paving the way to potential technical breakthroughs in e.g. quantum computing process via the application of spintronics@xcite .",
    "recently , extensive theoretical and experimental efforts have led to the realization of such fascinating behaviors in e.g. the hgte quantum wells@xcite , the bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 system@xcite and the bi@xmath5x@xmath6 ( x = te , se ) binary compounds@xcite .",
    "numerous half - heusler ternary compounds have been proposed , theoretically , to be potential new platforms for topological quantum phenomena@xcite , where the inherent flexibility of crystallographic , electronic and superconducting parameters provide a multidimensional basis for both scientific and technical exploration .",
    "the experimental determination of their topological class would set the basis for possible spintronic utilization and further studies on the interplay between the topological quantum phenomena versus e.g. the magnetic@xcite , superconducting@xcite and heavy fermionic@xcite behaviors .",
    "theoretically , the topological insulators experience a gapless surface state protected by time reversal symmetry and thus are robust against scattering from local impurities .",
    "such a surface state is  one half \" of a normal metal in that the surface bands are strongly spin - polarized , forming a unique spin helical texture@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the kramers theorem requires that the spin be degenerate at the kramers points - @xmath7-points of the surface brillouin zone where time reversal symmetry is preserved@xcite . at the interface between , say , a normal spin - orbit system and vacuum ,",
    "the spin - polarized surface bands connect pairwise ( kramers pair ) , crossing the chemical potential @xmath8 an even number of times between two distinct kramers points . at the interface between a topologically non - trivial material and vacuum",
    ", however , one expects the surface bands to cross @xmath8 an odd number of times@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic survey on the surface electronic structure of half - heusler compounds _ _ r__ptbi ( _ r _ = lu , dy , gd ) using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "our results show clear spin - orbit splitting of the surface bands that cross the chemical potential , which is nicely reproduced in the full - potential augmented plane wave calculation for a surface electronic state .",
    "the kramers degeneracy of spin is unambiguously detected at both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points .",
    "no direct indication of topologically non - trivial behavior is detected , except for the fact that there is a weak fermi crossing in the close vicinity to the @xmath1 point , making the total number of crossings five . in the surface band calculation , however , this inner crossing is explained by two spin - orbit splitting bands that are very close to each other , forming another kramers pair . in this band configuration",
    ", the total berry phase would be zero for the half - heusler systems , and they would not be topologically non - trivial .",
    "the detailed topological class of this family of materials thus remains an open question , requiring a detailed spin - resolved arpes study with ultra - high momentum resolution and a direct calculation of the topological invariants based on the first principle band structure .",

    "single crystals of _ _ r__ptbi ( _ r _ = lu , dy , gd ) were grown out of a bi flux and characterized by room temperature power x - ray diffraction measurements@xcite .",
    "the crystals grow as partial octahedra with the ( 111 ) facets exposed .",
    "typical dimensions of a single crystal are about @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the arpes measurements were performed at beamline 10.0.1 of the advanced light source ( als ) , berkeley , california using a scienta r4000 electron analyzer .",
    "vacuum conditions were better than @xmath13 torr .",
    "all arpes data was taken at @xmath14 k , above the magnetic ordering temperatures of all compounds@xcite .",
    "the energy resolution was set at @xmath15 15 mev .",
    "all samples were cleaved _ in situ _ , yielding clean ( 111 ) surfaces in which atoms arrange in a hexagonal lattice .",
    "high symmetry points for the surface brillouin zone are defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 with unit momentum @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lattice constant for each type of crystals .",
    "we emphasize here that no stress or pulling force is felt by the samples , which ensures that the measured data reveals the intrinsic electronic structure of the single crystals .",
    "we begin this survey in fig . 1 by showing the fermi maps of the three half - heusler compounds _ _ r__ptbi ( _ r _ = lu , dy , gd ) . previous theoretical calculations for the bulk electronic structure@xcite suggested that the kramers crossing at the @xmath1 point happens very close to @xmath8 ; the fermi surface reduces to a single point ( dirac point ) at @xmath1 . the data in fig .",
    "1 shows that , at least in the ( 111 ) cleaving plane , this is not the case .",
    "instead there are several bands crossing @xmath8 in the vicinity of both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points .",
    "the overall fermi surface for all three half - heusler compounds are similar , indicating a similar cleaving plane and band structure for all members . by comparing the band structure measured at the ( 111 ) surface with results of band calculations for gdptbi ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we find the cleaving plane to be bi(111 ) , marked by a red parallelogram in fig .",
    "1(a ) . a closer look at fig .",
    "1(c)-(e ) reveals that the @xmath1 pockets have different sizes for different heusler members .",
    "for example the circular @xmath1 pockets in luptbi are larger in size than those in gdptbi .",
    "this indicates a different effective electron occupancy for different members of the half - heusler family .",
    "one should also note that in fig .",
    "1(e ) the inner of the two bright @xmath1 pockets is hexagonal in shape , reminiscent of the hexagonal shape of the dirac cone in bi@xmath5te@xmath6 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is explained by higher order terms in the @xmath21 hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "this hexagonal shape is very nicely reproduced in the calculation [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . for clarifying the topological class of the half - heuslers ,",
    "two immediate questions follow the observations in fig . 1 : ( 1 ) are the observed bands actually arising due to the sample surface ? ( 2 ) exactly how many times do the bands intersect the chemical potential along the @xmath1-@xmath2 line segment ?         [ red box in fig . [",

    "there are in total two fermi crossings along the @xmath1-@xmath2 line segment at the vicinity of @xmath2.,width=336 ]    fig .",
    "2 shows the comparison between the arpes data and a calculational surface state in gdptbi . for both the band structure and fermi surface calculation",
    ", we used a full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method@xcite with a local density functional@xcite .",
    "the crystallographic unit cell is generated such that the ( 111 ) direction of the _ fcc _ brillouin zone points along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "for calculation of the surface electronic structure , supercells with three unit cell layers and a 21.87 a.u .",
    "vacuum is constructed .",
    "we calculated band structures of all six possible surface endings ( gd - bi - pt - bulk , gd - pt - bi - bulk , bi - gd - pt - bulk , bi - pt - gd - bulk , pt - gd - bi - bulk , pt - bi - gd - bulk ) ; only the bi - pt - gd - bulk construction shows good agreement with experiment [ fig .",
    "2(b ) , ( d)-(f ) ] .",
    "structural data were taken from a reported experimental result@xcite . to obtain the self - consistent charge density , we chose 48 @xmath7-points in the irreducible brillouin zone , and set @xmath23 to 7.5 , where @xmath24 is the smallest muffin - tin radius and @xmath25 is the plane - wave cutoff .",
    "we used muffin - tin radii of 2.5 , 2.4 and 2.4 a.u .",
    "for gd , bi , and pt respectively . for the non - magnetic - state calculation valid for comparison with arpes results at 15 k , the seven 4__f _",
    "_ electrons of gd atoms were treated as core electrons with no net spin polarization .",
    "the atoms near the surface ( bi , pt , gd ) were relaxed along the @xmath22-direction until the forces exerted on the atoms were less than 2.0 mry / a.u .. with this optimized structure , we obtained self - consistency with 0.01 mry / cell total energy convergence .",
    "after that , we calculated the band structure and two dimensional fermi surface in which we divided the rectangular cell connecting four @xmath9-points by @xmath26 , yielding 1681 @xmath7-points .    even at first glance , fig .",
    "2 gives the impression of remarkable agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "all basic features observed by arpes - the overall shape and location of the fermi pockets [ fig .",
    "2(a)-(b ) ] , the binding energies of the bands [ fig .",
    "2(c)-(d ) ] - are well reproduced by the calculation .",
    "the main point of this figure , however , is the fact that band calculations show a total of six fermi crossings along the @xmath1-@xmath2 line segment , which is an even number and is not directly consistent of the proposed strong topological insulating phenomenon@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , in order to take into account the spin - orbit splitting , relativistic effects are applied to the calculation .",
    "similar calculations reproduce clear topological insulating behavior in bi@xmath5te@xmath6 thin films@xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement shown in fig .",
    "2 also implies the validity of such calculation in half - heusler compounds .",
    "in fact traces for the inner two crossings is also found in the arpes data , where they appear to be one single crossing , most likely due to finite momentum resolution [ leftmost part in fig .",
    "2(c ) , see also fig .",
    "3(d)-(h ) ] .    in fig .",
    "3 we prove that the observed bands come from the sample surface .",
    "this is done by scanning the incident photon energy along both @xmath1-@xmath9 and @xmath1-@xmath2 high symmetry directions .",
    "varying the photon energy in arpes effectively changes the momentum offset along the direction perpendicular to the sample surface . in our case , this direction corresponds to @xmath27 or the ( 111 ) direction of the _ fcc _ brillouin zone .",
    "3(a)-(b ) show that all observed bands form straight lines along the @xmath27 direction , a clear indication for the lack of @xmath27 dependence . in fig .",
    "3(c ) we compare this to a calculated fermi surface map for the _ bulk _ bands , along the same direction as in fig .",
    "the difference is clear : the bulk bands are dispersive along the @xmath28-@xmath29 direction ; and most of the experimentally observed bands are not present in the calculation . in figs .",
    "3(d)-(h ) we pay special attention to the bands crossing @xmath8 near @xmath1 by showing the band structure for four different photon energies . in total",
    "there are at least three fermi contours surrounding @xmath1 , the outer two being a lot brighter than the inner one ( or two , see discussion for fig .",
    "2 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "3(h ) , these three ( or four ) bands cross @xmath8 at exactly the same @xmath7 positions for all photon energies .",
    "therefore all of them are surface bands . the data in fig .",
    "3 thus show , unambiguously , that a metallic surface electronic state exists in the half - heusler compounds .    the exact number of fermi crossings along the @xmath1-@xmath2 line segment is also examined in fig .",
    "4 . the main conclusion for fig . 4",
    "is that there are also three ( or four ) visible fermi crossings at the vicinity of @xmath1 between these two kramers points .",
    "we show these bands on the luptbi and gdptbi samples . both on the band dispersion maps [ figs .",
    "4(a)-(b ) ] and the momentum distribution curves [ mdcs , figs .",
    "4(c)-(d ) ] we see that there are two bright hole - like bands almost parallel to each other , and a much weaker inner band with lower fermi velocity .",
    "this inner band is not easy to see in the band maps ( nontheless indicated by green arrows ) , but is clearly visible in the mdcs by small intensity peaks tracing down from the one marked by a green bar [ also marked by a green color in figs .",
    "4(e)-(f ) ] .",
    "the same band also exists in the @xmath1-@xmath9 direction [ figs .",
    "3(d)-(h ) ] . same as the discussion for figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "this inner crossing is reproduced in the band calculation by two closely located spin - orbit - splitting bands that form a kramers pair .",
    "the brighter parallel bands form a second kramers pair of opposite spins . in fig .",
    "4(e)-(f ) we show the linear extrapolation of the two brighter bands .",
    "in gdptbi they are likely to reduce to a dirac point at about 0.4 ev above @xmath8 .",
    "if the total number of crossing is four , such a configuration will give zero contribution to the total berry phase .",
    "5 we examine the bands near the @xmath2 point . the @xmath7-space location of the arpes maps [ figs .",
    "5(a)-(d ) ] is shown in fig .",
    "panels 5(g)-(h ) present the band dispersion maps for two cuts crossing @xmath2 , whose positions are marked in panel 5(f ) with the band calculation result .",
    "5(a)-(d ) show that the @xmath2 bands form a very special shape . at high binding energies",
    "[ @xmath30 ev , fig .",
    "5(d ) ] , two u - shape bands are well separated . as binding energy decreases",
    "these two bands merge into each other and hybridize to form a central elliptical contour and two curly - bracket - like segments .",
    "the segments near each @xmath2 points link together , forming another large fermi contour enclosing the zone center @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "5(g)-(h ) that there are two fermi crossings in both the @xmath1-@xmath9 and @xmath1-@xmath2 directions .",
    "the special shape of the fermi surface is formed by two bands that are likely to be members of another kramers pair .",
    "kramers degeneracy of spin happens at @xmath31 mev below @xmath8 .",
    "all this features are obtained with our calculation for the surface states [ fig 2(b ) and 2(e ) ] . these two bands also give zero contribution to the total berry phase .    in summary",
    ", we performed an arpes survey on the electronic structure of three half - heusler compounds _ _ r__ptbi ( _ r _ = lu , dy , gd ) which are proposed to be topological insulators .",
    "our result show unambiguously that these materials have a metallic surface state markedly different from the calculational result on the bulk electronic structures .",
    "this surface state is reproduced with high accuracy in our band calculations .",
    "both experiment and theory reveal several bands that cross the fermi level .",
    "knowledge of the exact number of these bands is possibly limited by experimental momentum resolution .",
    "no direct consistency with the proposed strong topological insulating behavior is found in the arpes results . for final determination of their topological classes ,",
    "both an apres measurement of ultrahigh @xmath7-resolution and a direct calculation of the first chern number as a topological invariant @xcite are in need .",
