    "after the first direct evidence for the point - like constituents in the nucleon@xcite , identified as the valence quarks with spin-1/2 in the naive constituent quark model ( nqm)@xcite , a lot of experiments have been conducted to probe the structure of the proton in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments . surprisingly , the dis results in the early 80s@xcite indicated that the valence quarks of the proton carry only about 30% of its spin and is referred to as the `` proton spin crisis '' in the nqm .",
    "these results provided the first evidence for the proton being composed of three valence quarks surrounded by an indistinct sea of quark - antiquark pairs ( henceforth referred to as the `` quark sea '' ) . in the present day",
    ", the study of the composition of hadrons can be said to be primarily the study of the quark sea and gluons and is considered as one of the active areas in hadronic physics .    the conventional expectation that the quark sea perhaps can be obtained through the perturbative production of the quark - antiquark pairs by gluons produces nearly equal numbers of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . until early 90 s a symmetric sea w.r.t . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 was assumed , however , the famous new muon collaboration in 1991@xcite established the quark sea asymmetry of the unpolarized quarks in the case of nucleon by measuring @xmath6 giving first clear evidence for the nonperturbative origin of the quark sea .",
    "this was later confirmed by the drell - yan experiments@xcite which measured a large quark sea asymmetry ratio @xmath7 reminding us that the study of the quark sea is intrinsically a nonperturbative phenomena and it is still a big challenge to perform these calculations from the first principles of qcd .",
    "one approach to account for the observed quark sea asymmetry is the pion cloud mechanism@xcite where the quark sea is believed to originate from process such as virtual pion production .",
    "it is suggested that in the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering , the lepton probe also scatters off the pion cloud surrounding the target proton .",
    "the @xmath8 cloud , dominant in the process @xmath9 , leads to an excess of @xmath5 sea .",
    "however , this effect should be significantly reduced by the emissions such as @xmath10 with @xmath11 cloud .",
    "therefore , the pion cloud idea is not able to explain the significant @xmath12 asymmetry .",
    "this approach can be improved upon by adopting a mechanism which operates in the _ interior _ of the hadron .    the chiral constituent quark model ( @xmath0cqm)@xcite can yield an adequate description of the quark sea generation through the chiral fluctuations . the basic idea is based on the possibility that chiral symmetry breaking takes place at a distance scale much smaller than the confinement scale . in this region ,",
    "the effective degrees of freedom are the valence quarks and the internal goldstone bosons ( gbs ) which are coupled to the valence quarks@xcite allowing a simple and intuitive method to investigate the principle features of the hadron structure . in the case of spin",
    "dependent quantities , the @xmath0cqm is not only successful in giving a satisfactory explanation of `` proton spin crisis''@xcite but is also able to account for the baryon magnetic moments@xcite and hyperon @xmath13decay parameters@xcite .",
    "however , in the case of quark distribution functions , the latest developments by the nusea ( e866)@xcite and hermes@xcite to determine the variation of the sea - antiquark ratio @xmath14 and the difference @xmath2 with bjorken scaling variable @xmath1 have renewed considerable interest in the quark sea asymmetries .",
    "recently , there has been substantial theoretical progress to take into account the effects of quark sea in determining the flavor structure of the baryons and the question of sea asymmetry has been investigated by several authors using various phenomenological models .",
    "calculations have been carried out in the meson cloud models@xcite , chiral quark - soliton model@xcite , effective chiral quark model@xcite , statistical models@xcite , bag model@xcite , model for parton densities@xcite , radiative parton model@xcite etc .. however , the inclusion of @xmath15dependence has not yet been successfully included in the quark distribution functions .",
    "therefore , pending further experiments , it would be interesting to examine the flavor structure of the octet baryons at low energy , thereby giving vital clues to the nonperturbative effects of qcd .",
    "the study of @xmath15dependence in the quark distribution functions becomes particularly interesting for the @xmath0cqm where the effects of quark sea and valence quarks can separately be calculated .",
    "the purpose of the present communication is to determine the sea quark distribution functions and their asymmetries in the octet baryons by phenomenologically incorporating @xmath15dependence in the @xmath0cqm .",
    "the extent of contributions coming from the different sea quarks for the octet baryons can also be compared . to understand the relation of the bjorken scaling variable and quark sea",
    ", it would be significant to study its implications in the region @xmath16 which is a relatively clean region to test the quark sea structure as well as to estimate their structure functions and related quantities@xcite .",

    "the flavor structure for the baryon of the type @xmath40 is expressed as @xmath41 quark distribution functions ----------------------------    there are no simple or straightforward rules which could allow incorporation of @xmath15dependence in @xmath0cqm . to this end , instead of using an _ ab initio _ approach ,",

    "after having detailed the contribution of the quark sea and the various asymmetries in the octet baryons of different quark structure , we now discuss the variation of these quantities with the bjorken variable @xmath1 . for the numerical calculation of the sea quark distribution functions of the octet baryons",

    "one can easily find out that    @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 showing a clear quark sea asymmetry as observed in the dis experiments@xcite .",
    "these distributions clearly indicate that our results pertaining to the quark sea asymmetry seem to be well in line with the expected results . as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the sea quarks do not contribute at higher values of @xmath1 , therefore in this region , the contributions should be completely dominated by the valence quarks . the difference between the various sea distributions",
    "is observed to be maximum at @xmath62 . as the value of @xmath1 increases , the difference between the sea contributions decreases in all the cases which is in line with the observations of other models@xcite .",
    "the general aspects of the variation of the magnitudes of the sea quark distribution functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the octet baryons are able to explain some of the well known experimentally measurable quantities , for example , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the gottfried integral .",
    "these quantities not only provide important constraint on a model that attempts to describe the origin of the quark sea but also provide a direct determination of the presence of significant amount of quark sea in the low @xmath1 region .",
    "when @xmath1 is small , @xmath68 asymmetries are large implying the dominance of sea quarks in the low @xmath1 region .",
    "in fact , the sea quarks dominate only in the region where @xmath1 is smaller than 0.3 . at the values @xmath69",
    ", @xmath6 tends to 0 implying that there are no sea quarks in this region .",
    "the contribution of the quark sea in the case of @xmath70 is particularly interesting because of its flavor structure which has equal numbers of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 quarks in its valence structure . unlike the other octet baryons , where the @xmath2 asymmetry decreases continuously with the @xmath1 values , the asymmetry in this case first increases and",
    "then for values of @xmath74 it decreases .",
    "however , it is interesting to observe the the asymmetry peak in this case which matches with our other predictions where the contribution of the quark sea is maximum at @xmath62    a measurement of the gottfried integral@xcite for the case of nucleon has shown a clear violation of gottfried sum rule from @xmath75 which can find its explanation in a global quark sea asymmetry @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , for the case of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , the gottfried sum rules should read @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 if the quark sea was symmetric .",
    "however , due to the @xmath2 asymmetry in the case of octet baryons , a lower value of the gottfried integrals is obtained . in the case of nucleon",
    "the results are in good agreement with the experimental data@xcite as already presented in@xcite .",
    "the quality of numerical agreement in the other cases can be assessed only after the data gets refined .",
    "further , this phenomenological analysis strongly suggests an important role for the quark sea at low value of @xmath1 .",
    "new experiments aimed at measuring the flavor content of the other octet baryons are needed for profound understanding of the nonperturbative properties of qcd .",
    "to summarize , in order to investigate the effects of `` quark sea '' , we have calculated the sea quark distribution functions for the octet baryons in the chiral constituent quark model ( @xmath0cqm ) .",
    "the bjorken scaling variable @xmath1 has been incorporated phenomenologically to enlarge the scope of model and to understand the range of @xmath1 where quark sea effects are important .",
    "implications of the quark sea have also been studied to estimate the quark sea asymmetries like @xmath2 , @xmath3 and gottfried integral .",
    "the results justify our conclusion regarding the importance of quark sea at small values of @xmath1 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results obtained for the quark distribution functions reinforce our conclusion that @xmath0cqm is able to generate qualitatively as well as quantitatively the requisite amount of quark sea .",
    "this can perhaps be substantiated by a measurement of the quark distribution functions of the other octet baryons .",
