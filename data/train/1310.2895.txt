    "models for bubble dynamics consisting of ordinary differential equations for the different modes of oscillation ( radial pulsation , translation , shape oscillations , etc . ) have proven relatively successful in representing bubble dynamics @xcite .",
    "we refer to these as discrete bubble models , that is , models in which the bubble is represented by a set of discrete , coupled , dynamical modes .",
    "the canonical example of a discrete model for a single bubble is due to rayleigh @xcite and plesset @xcite .",
    "this model has been modified and extended to account for liquid compressibility ( radiation damping or energy lost to acoustic radiation)@xcite , thermodynamic @xcite , and viscous effects @xcite .",

    "liquid compressibility is included in discrete bubble models as a delay in the bubble - bubble interaction terms .",
    "models for interacting bubbles in an compressible liquid have been derived primarily in the linear approximation as systems of coupled resonant scatterers @xcite or as _ ad hoc _ modifications of the incompressible case @xcite . for frequency - domain models and eigenvalue analysis of linearized model equations",
    ", the delay in bubble interaction manifests as a complex phase coefficient . for time - domain models ,",
    "the system of ordinary differential equations is converted to a system of delay differential equations .",
    "the majority of previous analyses have relied on the frequency domain approach or eigenvalue analyses .",
    "@xcite used a frequency domain analysis to show that liquid compressibility can have a significant impact on the damping of a bubble system , even for closely spaced bubbles .",
    "in fact , it was shown that as the bubble separation distance approaches zero , the radiation damping also approaches zero for bubbles in antiphase motion .",
    "it has been shown by eigenvalue analysis that the use of delay differential equation models can provide better agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , studies based on the time domain integration of the delay differential equations of motion for a bubble system are relatively rare @xcite",
    ". this may be due to the difficulties associated with integrating delay differential equations numerically .",
    "numerical integration of delay differential equations requires special tools @xcite , and delay differential equations may exhibit unexpected behavior @xcite .",
    "mathematical analysis of bubble models with time delay has shown that certain models exhibit instability @xcite .",
    "however the causes and implications of these model instabilities has not been investigated .",
    "the primary goals of this paper are first to illustrate instabilities in certain previously proposed models and second to present a new model based on a set of delay differential equations .",
    "the new model appears to be more accurate for the single bubble case and does not possess the same unstable behavior for the single and interacting bubble cases .",
    "we will show that most previously proposed models for the dynamics of coupled bubbles in a compressible liquid are unstable for time - domain simulation of closely spaced bubbles . because closely spaced bubbles do not exhibit unbounded growth , this instability is nonphysical and we view it as a deficiency of existing models that must be corrected .",
    "system stability is required by energy conservation ; in the absence of external forcing , each bubble begins with a finite amount of energy and can not gain any energy . in an incompressible , inviscid medium without thermal effects",
    "a bubble will oscillate indefinitely as the energy is converted between potential energy due to the compression of the gas in the bubble and kinetic energy due to the motion of the surrounding fluid .",
    "no energy is radiated or lost from the system .",
    "the same holds for a multibubble system , the total energy in the system is constant . for a single bubble in a compressible medium ,",
    "as the bubble oscillates it produces waves that carry energy away from the bubble ; this produces a damping effect in the bubble motion , often called radiation damping @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of compressibility effects in models for the dynamics of systems of coupled bubbles requires a delay in bubble interaction to account for wave propagation .",
    "it has been suggested that the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) models for coupled bubble dynamics in an incompressible liquid can be used to obtain model equations for dynamics in a compressible liquid by incorporating the propagation delays @xcite .",
    "this produces a delay differential equation ( dde ) model for bubble dynamics in a compressible liquid .",
    "a system of ddes may have very different behavior from the related ode system obtained by removing the delay , even becoming unstable @xcite .",
    "physical considerations dictate that a model for bubbles in a compressible liquid must remain stable .",
    "the only difference between a bubble system in an incompressible liquid and the same system in a compressible liquid is the rate at which the system radiates ( loses ) energy . in the incompressible",
    "liquid , the system does not radiate ; in the compressible liquid it does .",
    "this means that the peak oscillation amplitude of the system will decrease in a compressible liquid as energy is radiated .",
    "this suggests a criterion of stability for valid bubble models .",
    "@xcite showed that the damping of a bubble system is very different with , and without , delayed interaction .",
    "in fact , the radiation damping was shown to approach zero for equally - sized bubbles in antiphase motion .",
    "the dominant mode of bubble motion is the radial pulsation mode , this is the only mode considered here .",
    "translation and higher - order shape oscillations are neglected .",
    "discrete bubble models are typically formulated in terms of the bubble radius @xmath0 or the bubble volume @xmath1 . for systems containing multiple bubbles ,",
    "the variables associated with the current bubble are indexed by @xmath2 and the interactions with other bubbles in the system are represented by sums over the indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "the linearization of [ eq : lagdampeom ] is obtained by assuming that the bubble radius can be represented as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radial displacement and retaining only terms that are linear in @xmath14 .",
    "the result is @xmath15 where the minnaert or natural oscillation frequency of a single bubble is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the polytropic constant or ratio of specific heats for the gas inside the bubble .",
    "this model was used by @xcite and @xcite .    the instability in [ eq : linprevdampeom ]",
    "is demonstrated by considering a system of two bubbles . for a system of two bubbles of equal size separated by a distance @xmath18 without an external source , [ eq : linprevdampeom ] produces a set of coupled equations :    @xmath19    where the dimensionless radiation damping coefficient is @xmath20 , and the interaction delay @xmath21 is given by @xmath22    a decoupled system of equations is obtained by adding and subtracting [ eq : twobublineqa , eq : twobublineqb ] and defining @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "the characteristic equations for the in - phase and antiphase modes of [ eq : linprevdampeom ] are    [ eq : twobubprevapproxchareq ] @xmath31    respectively .",

    "the results in [ fig : two - bub - rad - damp - ana - prev ] were obtained by applying a numerical root - finding algorithm to eqs .  .",
    "it can be seen that antiphase motion of the system is unstable for closely spaced bubbles . as stated previously , this instability represents a deficiency in this bubble model .",
    "we now consider several previous models formulated in terms of the bubble volume .",
    "@xcite proposed @xmath35 as a volumetric model for bubble oscillation .",
    "this model is unique because the radiation damping is represented by the @xmath36 term .",

    "the real root of [ eq : tdfs - char ] is positive and thus represents an unstable mode .",
    "this instability will not be observed in purely time - harmonic systems ; however , any transient excitation will excite this instability .",

    "the instability can be eliminated by iteratively differentiating and substituting while retaining terms to @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the result can be shown to be equivalent to [ eq : lagdampeom ] and [ eq : linprevdampeom ] for the nonlinear and linear cases , respectively and will thus be unstable for the coupled bubble problem .",

    "@xcite along with series expansions that partially correct the instabilities .",
    "it should be noted that unstable modes were not observed in previous work by @xcite and @xcite because of the methods that were employed .",
    "@xcite assumed that the motion was time harmonic and that the oscillation frequency was given by the oscillation frequency of coupled bubbles in an incompressible liquid ; fixing the oscillation frequency ensures a stable time - harmonic form .",
    "the analysis shown @xcite also assumed a time - harmonic form and both interaction and nonlinear terms were included via expansion to a certain order .",
    "the expansion employed produces unstable modes that are not oscillatory as was shown in [ eq : tdfs - char , eq : tdfs - roots ] . therefore the time - harmonic assumption removes any unstable modes .",
    "the work of @xcite considered the transcendental nature of the characteristic equations but limited the search for eigenvalues to the neighborhood of the eigenvalues of the system in the incompressible limit ; additionally , the damping due to viscous and thermal effects was sufficiently high to preclude the observation of unstable modes .",
    "it appears that the conclusions presented in the work of feuillade @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are valid for the parameter and frequency ranges that were considered . in general",
    ", all modes of a system will be excited in a time - domain simulation and thus the unstable modes of these models will provide nonphysical results . additionally , even when the unstable modes are masked by damping they may affect the predicted dynamics .",
