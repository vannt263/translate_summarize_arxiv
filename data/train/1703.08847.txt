    "topological surface states in systems with strong spin - orbit interactions have become the focus of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial topology of the respective electronic states results in a number of novel quantum phenomena , for example , the surface of a topological insulator ( ti ) has to be conducting since the transition from a nontrivial insulator to the vacuum or an ordinary insulator demands the electronic surface states to be gapless .",
    "the surface states are usually protected by symmetry , e.g. the time reversal symmetry in a three - dimensional ti .",
    "the intrinsic characteristics of topological surface states is the dirac - like dispersion and their two - dimensional character , both properties can be experimentally verified .",
    "while the band structure and the existence of electronic states with a dirac - like dispersion filling the gap between the valence and conduction bands can be verified in angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) , the electrical transport properties of the surface states and the associated quantum oscillations in magnetic fields ( shubnikov - de haas effect ) are frequently utilized to prove the topological surface states in various systems .",
    "this method works very well as long as the bulk states of the ti are insulating , i.e. the fermi energy falls into the bulk band gap @xcite .",
    "however , many topological systems are conducting in the bulk due to defects resulting in a shift of the fermi energy into the conduction or valence bands .",
    "a typical example is the bi@xmath0se@xmath6 - bi@xmath0te@xmath6 system @xcite where it was also found that bulk conduction interfering with surface conduction made it difficult , if not impossible , to detect the specific signature of the surface states in shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations of the conductivity @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent study of metallic bi@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2 we found the distinct signature of topological surface states in sdh oscillations by investigating the dependence of the quantum oscillations on the angle of the magnetic field with the surface of the crystal as well as the berry phase which was found consistent with the dirac nature of the conducting particles ( holes ) @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , in the magnetic field range up to 7 tesla , no sdh oscillations from bulk carriers have been observed in this study although the bulk conduction turned out to be metallic to the lowest temperatures and the total carrier density was relatively high , leading to the speculation that the quantum oscillations from bulk carriers had been strongly suppressed at low fields but might be found at higher magnetic fields .    in this work",
    "we extend the magnetic field range to 35 tesla and study the sdh oscillation spectrum in hole - like metallic bi@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "we prove that indeed sdh oscillations from bulk carriers dominate in the high - field range and are attenuated at lower fields .",
    "this enables us to separate bulk and surface states , determine the relevant parameters , and explain the interference and possible separation of surface and bulk quantum oscillations .",
    "the growth of the single crystals of bi@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2 was achieved by utilizing a modified bridgman technique with high purity starting materials bi ( 99.9999% ) , se ( 99.9999% ) , and te ( 99.9999% ) .",
    "the mixture , enclosed in quartz ampoules , was molten at 875 @xmath7c and kept at this temperature for 2 days .",
    "the melt was slowly cooled to 670 @xmath7c at a rate of 0.5 @xmath7c / h .",
    "the crystals were finally cooled to room temperature at a speed of 10 @xmath7c / h .",
    "platelet - like crystals of typical size 5 mm x 3 mm x 0.1 mm have been extracted from the synthesis product .",
    "all crystals prepared for transport measurements have been cleaved to provide fresh and clean surfaces .",
    "magnetotransport measurements have been conducted using a lock - in technique at the national high magnetic field laboratory ( nhmfl ) in tallahassee , fl . six gold contacts were sputtered onto one surface of the crystal to conduct longitudinal ( resistance ) and transverse ( hall ) measurements .",
    "platinum wires were attached to the gold pads with silver paint .",
    "the sample was mounted on a rotating platform which allowed for positioning the sample at different angles with the magnetic field .",
    "the platform , mounted in a @xmath8he cryostat ( oxford ) , was inserted into the 32 mm bore of a resistive magnet with a maximum field of 35 tesla .",
    "the metallic character of the bulk conductivity is demonstrated in fig .",
    "the continuous decrease of the resistivity @xmath9 upon decreasing temperature and the positive slope of the hall resistance @xmath10 ( shown in the inset to fig .",
    "1 ) prove that the charge carriers are holes and the fermi energy is positioned below the top of the valence band , consistent with other crystals from the same growth batch @xcite . from the hall data measured at 5 k ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the bulk hole carrier density is determined as @xmath111.3@xmath1210@xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "this number is in good agreement with the carrier density of a similar crystal of the same chemical composition @xcite .",
    "longitudinal and hall resistance of bi@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2 are measured in high magnetic field up to 35 tesla at the nhmfl , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath10 show quantum oscillations at high magnetic fields .",
    "the quantum oscillations in longitudinal and hall components have a same frequency but have a phase difference of 90@xmath16 . since in our data it is easier to subtract a background signal in hall component than that in longitudinal , we have taken fourier transform of the hall signal for frequency analyses .",
    "the oscillatory part @xmath17 , obtained after subtracting a smooth polynomial background , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "3 that the data can not be described by an oscillation with one single frequency only , but rather by a superposition of different frequencies .",

    ". however , the relative weight of the oscillations with @xmath3 and @xmath4 depends on the magnetic field range suggesting that @xmath4 is not likely to be the second harmonic of @xmath3 .",
    "this is supported in our analysis of the sdh oscillations proving its bulk origin from both the angle dependence measurements and berry phase calculations .",
    "the sdh oscillation with the lower frequency @xmath3 dominates in the low - field range whereas the higher frequency @xmath4 is stronger at higher magnetic fields .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",

    "is shown for various field ranges , @xmath22 as indicated in the figures . in the low - field @xmath22",
    "= ( 0 to 5 ) tesla , the fft exhibits only one peak at frequency @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "this is similar to and consistent with the earlier work that was limited to magnetic fields below 7 tesla @xcite . with increasing magnetic field ,",
    "a second peak at @xmath4 develops ( fig .",
    "4b ) and for fields up to 15 tesla both peaks have about the same magnitude ( fig .",
    "4c ) . with further increasing field ,",
    "the @xmath4 peak becomes dominant ( fig .",
    "the development of the two peaks shown in fig .",
    "4 prove that @xmath3 and @xmath4 characterize sdh oscillations of different origin . in our previous communication",
    ", we have shown that the low - frequency oscillation ( @xmath3 ) arises from topological surface states , but the origin of the second frequency observed at higher fields is not clear .",
    "it appears conceivable to attribute the @xmath4 frequency to bulk sdh oscillations , as conjectured earlier @xcite . to study the properties of the @xmath4 oscillation it has to be resolved separately , without the interference from the surface state oscillations ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by analyzing the high - field data above 10 tesla .",
    "5 shows that the fft of the data above 10 tesla exhibits only one pronounced peak at frequency @xmath4 , i.e. the contribution from surface oscillations is largely eliminated .     in the high - field range ,",
    "between 10 and 35 tesla .",
    "only one peak is observed at frequency @xmath4.,width=288 ]      sdh oscillations from bulk and surface states can be distinguished by measuring the dependence on the angle with the magnetic field .",
    "surface oscillations of @xmath17 or @xmath23 are expected to be periodic if plotted as function of the inverse normal component , 1/@xmath24 , of the field with respect to the surface . if the field angle @xmath25 to the normal of the surface changes , the position of the oscillation frequency follows a 1/cos@xmath25 scaling , due to the strictly two - dimensional character of the surface conduction @xcite .",
    "for bulk conduction , however , the sdh frequency will not follow the 1/cos@xmath25 scaling , but it may still show a minor angle dependence if the fermi surface geometry is anisotropic .",
    "the angle dependent measurements have been conducted over the whole field range up to 35 tesla and angles between 0@xmath7 and 70@xmath7 .",
    "the fourier transform to determine @xmath3 and @xmath4 at different field angles was calculated using the data measured at various angles @xmath25 , similar to the data for @xmath25=0@xmath7 in fig .",
    "3 . as shown in fig . 6 , the frequency @xmath3 scales well with 1/cos(@xmath25 ) ( dashed line in fig .",
    "6a ) indicating that this conduction channel is two - dimensional .",
    "the @xmath4 oscillation , however , changes only very little with the angle @xmath25 and is therefore attributed to the bulk conduction channel ( fig .",
    "( a ) and @xmath4 ( b ) .",
    "only @xmath3 follows the 1/cos(@xmath25 ) scaling for surface conduction ( dashed line).,width=384 ]    it should be noted that there is a small shoulder in the fourier transform near 100 tesla visible in figs .",
    "this shoulder develops into a peak with frequency @xmath26 90 to 100 tesla with increasing angle @xmath25 .",
    "this additional peak is attributed to another section of the bulk fermi surface which contributes to the sdh oscillations only at higher angles @xmath25 .",
    "since the value of @xmath27 is nearly independent of the angle @xmath25 , it can not arise from surface states .      the angle dependent transport data discussed so far lead to the conclusion that sdh oscillations from bulk and topological surface states can be measured simultaneously and resolved separately in different magnetic field ranges .",
    "the conclusion is further supported by an analysis of the berry phase which distinguishes the nature of the charge carriers .",
    "the charge carriers of the topologically nontrivial surface states with a dirac dispersion are expected to have a berry phase @xmath281/2 , in contrast to the bulk carriers with a berry phase of zero .",
    "@xmath29 can be determined from the landau level fan diagram @xcite .",

    "<S> only sdh oscillation from topological surface states can be detected whereas at high magnetic field the bulk oscillations dominate . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the separation of bulk and surface sdh oscillations into different magnetic field ranges is revealed in the difference of the cyclotron masses @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk @xmath5 is nearly three times larger than the surface cyclotron mass resulting in a stronger attenuation of the bulk oscillation amplitude upon decreasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to detect and characterize the surface sdh oscillations in the low - field range and the bulk oscillations at high magnetic fields .    </S>",
