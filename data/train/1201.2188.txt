    "it is obvious that identification of particles and fragments produced in nuclear reactions is crucial for any experimental or technical work in nuclear physics . among different ways of identifying charged particles",
    "the classical @xmath0 telescope method remains still the flagship .",
    "recently , an alternative method based on the pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique applied for silicon detectors is being developed and is increasingly drawing attention .",
    "recent results demonstrate that the method can offer charge and isotopic identification comparable to that obtained with the classical @xmath0 method .",
    "the main advantage of the psd method comes from the fact that it requires only one electronic channel for detection and identification .",
    "it is thus an important point for designing and constructing multi - detector systems .    a significant difference between the @xmath0 and the psd techniques results from the fact that the former is governed basically by the energy loss process ( bragg curve ) , while the latter is primarily related to the plasma delay effect ( pde ) [ 1 - 6 ] . in silicon detectors",
    ", this effect manifests itself with shortening of the pulse rise time with decreasing @xmath1 for low and intermediate mass fragments , for which the generated charge is practically completely collected by the detector electrodes .",
    "the experimental data demonstrates that the pde concerns particles with small @xmath1 , for which the pulse hight defect ( phd ) is still of little importance .    for better understanding of the identification idea associated with psd technique , and for its future development , it is crucial to have at ones command a perfect simulation of the time dependence of the experimental signal produced by an ion with a given charge , @xmath1 , atomic mass , @xmath2 , and energy , @xmath3 .",
    "the main goal of such a simulation is to describe the extraction and collection of the generated charge carriers moving in the external electric field distorted due to the presence of a highly ionized track and due to the diffusion process of the carriers .    as presented in @xcite , an approach in which the distortion of the electric field caused by the generated carriers is neglected , is able to correctly describe the current signals for light charged particles ( lcp ) , e.g. protons .",
    "however , this simplified approach completely fails in case of heavy ions ( hi ) for which the collection time of the generated carriers gets longer @xmath4 .",
    "historically , this difference , associated to a slower carrier collection for hi , was quantified as a plasma delay ( pd ) effect .",
    "since this effect influences the current signal rise - time , it appears to be crucial for the psd technique .",
    "an attempt to describe phenomenologically the delayed carrier collection time in silicon detectors has been recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the proposed description took into account the polarization of the electron - hole pairs generated by the hi and connected it to the relative dielectric permittivity .",
    "another important assumption was that the dissociation of pairs in time occurred with a constant probability and the modified electric field , inside and outside of the ion range , was given by the maxwell equation for the electric field in the inhomogeneous medium . with these assumptions ,",
    "the model was indeed able to describe the experimental pulse shapes quite accurately .    in the present paper",
    "we propose another , more microscopic approach .",
    "the main model assumptions are the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\i .",
    "propagation of the electric charges ( electrons , holes ) generated in the detector is represented by evolution of the gaussian clouds for which the centroids and variances are treated as independent variables .",
    "position of the centroid of each gaussian is governed by the drift process , while its variance undergoes both , diffusion and the drift process . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the first results of the model calculations indicate some binding effects between the holes and electrons , in a region similar to that predicted by the phenomenological model of ref . @xcite",
    ". in this region also the electric field shows similar behavior to that presented in @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of the new model is presented in the following section .",
    "the preliminary results of the calculations and comparison to the experimental data are presented in section 3 ; conclusions and possible extensions of the model applicability are given in section 4 .",
    "a particle entering the silicon detector is assumed to degrade its energy according to the bragg curve which relates the generated ionization @xmath5 to the particle position @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the x direction is perpendicular to the detector surface . in order to describe the initial , local , density of the electrons @xmath7 and holes",

    "this assumption states that for @xmath14 the ionization is localized along the x axis only and disappears elsewhere .    in order to describe the time evolution of the generated ionization",
    "we assume its distribution in the following form :    @xmath15    @xmath16    which is analog to ( [ eq : jonizacja ] ) and we set : @xmath17    functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 are assumed to be gaussians : @xmath20    and @xmath21    if @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 then the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be regarded as representations of the @xmath25 function , thus : @xmath26 now , the goal is to describe the time evolution of the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath18 , @xmath18 ( for determination of @xmath18 , @xmath18 it is sufficient to derive the time evolution of their variances @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) . in order to do it we define the one dimensional densities associated with the variable @xmath6 as :    @xmath31    @xmath32    and we divide the thickness of the detector @xmath33 into @xmath34 intervals @xmath35 .",
    "let us assume that in the interval @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) the associated values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 do not change substantially within the radius of a few sigma around @xmath36 , and that a linear approximation can be used for the functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 within @xmath36 :    @xmath42    @xmath43    with the above assumption for @xmath6 within an interval @xmath36 one can approximate the densities :    @xmath44    @xmath45    which means that , in practice , one can use the same coefficients for linear expansion of both , the densities @xmath46 @xmath47 and of the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce also the @xmath48 and @xmath49 coordinates , which denote the beginning and end of the @xmath50 distributions for electrons .",
    "similar coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath52 are introduced for holes ( see right - upper panel on fig .",
    "2 ) .      in order to determine the drift velocity associated with the centers of gaussians @xmath18",
    ", @xmath19 we have to calculate the respective effective electric field acting on the carriers described by above distributions .",
    "such a field is determined by a static voltage applied to the detector electrodes and by the coulomb interaction between the gaussian charge clouds .",
    "the detector static field at position @xmath6 , considered from the rear side of the detector ( order @xmath53 from the point of view of the particle entering the detector , see e.g. @xcite ) , is given as :    @xmath54    where the bias voltage @xmath55 is assumed to be higher than the depletion voltage @xmath56 which for the bulk concentration of donors @xmath57 and permittivity @xmath58 reads as : @xmath59    in order to find the modification of the electric field caused by the generated plasma , let us consider two gaussians describing the distribution of the charges @xmath60 , @xmath61 , centered at a relative distance @xmath62@xmath63 and characterized by variances @xmath64 , @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the mutual interaction potential of the clouds can then be expressed in the form which can be often found in quantum molecular dynamics calculations ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath66    @xmath67    where @xmath68 .",
    "let us now assume that the intervals @xmath36 are small enough to enable the linear approximation for the charge densities @xmath69 @xmath70 and the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 with the use of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for simplicity ,",
    "we introduce variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 in lieu of the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "if we denote the endpoints of the @xmath36 interval by @xmath77 and @xmath78 then for a gaussian centered at a point @xmath79 and representing the charge @xmath80 , its interaction with the charge located in the interval @xmath81 given by ( [ eta_e_bis ] ) and ( [ eta_h_bis ] ) , can be formulated as :    @xmath82    where the @xmath83 and above denote the standard deviations of the gaussian describing the charge @xmath80 and of the gaussian from the interval @xmath36 , respectively , and @xmath84 .",
    "the above form allows us to describe the respective effective electric field @xmath85 acting on the gaussian located at a point @xmath79 as @xmath86 since @xmath87 = @xmath88 , the above formula can be expressed as :    @xmath89    @xmath90    after integrating by parts one obtains :    @xmath91    @xmath92    the last integral can be easily evaluated by expanding the error function .",
    "the total effective electric field modified due to the presence of plasma can be obtained by summing up contributions of charges located in all intervals @xmath93 and of their mirror charges induced in the detector electrodes ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in order to determine the time evolution of the charge distribution one has to know , in addition , the generalized force associated with the @xmath83 variable .",
    "similarly as for the effective electric field , the net value of the force acting in the @xmath83 direction can be obtained by summing over all ingredients associated with the charge distribution .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the interaction with the charge located in the @xmath36 interval : @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    now we are in position to calculate the time evolution of the charge generated in the detector .",
    "this process is determined by the drift and by the diffusion of the interacting clouds of electrons and holes .",
    "we will consider the evolution of the centroids and of the variances of gaussians representing a fraction of the charge distribution located in the middle of the intervals @xmath36 and at the start- and end - points of the distributions of electrons and holes ( points @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .      in the present subsection we will describe the numerical method used to determine the time evolution of the ionization clouds . in the following",
    "we assume that the evolution of the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 is determined by the time evolutions of the coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 . in order to find how the expansion coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 propagate in time",
    ", we have to investigate the time evolution of the functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "below we consider the formulas for electrons only , keeping in mind that the formulas for holes are analogical .",
    "as we will show later    @xmath103    thus , the differential @xmath104 can be written as    @xmath105    if the @xmath106 denotes the center of the interval @xmath36 and @xmath98 and @xmath97 are the coefficients of linear expansion    @xmath107    and , if one denotes the average velocity and the average linear density associated with the interval @xmath36 by @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , then :    @xmath110    here , @xmath111 is the differential coefficient of @xmath112 at the point @xmath106 .",
    "as one can see , in order to calculate the above increment , we have to trace the time dependent tables of @xmath113 , .",
    "the tables of @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath111 are obtained by fitting the smooth curves to the distributions @xmath113 , in every time step .",
    "for @xmath14 the @xmath114 is given by the bragg curve . in order to make use of the formula ( [ eq : increment_eta ] ) we need to construct the respective tables for velocities . knowing the effective electric field for electrons in the @xmath6 direction , @xmath115",
    ", one can assume that the respective average velocity of the center of gaussian located at a point @xmath106 is proportional to the strength of the field :    @xmath116    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the electron and hole mobilities , respectively .",
    "knowing the drift velocity , one can calculate the evolution of the charge deposited in every interval @xmath36 including the edge intervals with variable ends @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 .      the diffusion and transport processes in the electric field influence also the widths of the charge distributions located in every @xmath36 interval . extending the above reasoning we can assume that the velocity , @xmath119 , describing the rate of the standard deviation expansion in perpendicular direction has three components : @xmath120    the first term , @xmath121 , results from the field described by ( [ eq : f_sig ] ) . in analogy to the charge drift in @xmath6 direction",
    ", one can assume that this component is proportional to the field acting on the charge @xmath80 associated with the gaussian with a standard deviation @xmath83 @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the net force given by interaction ( [ eq : f_sig ] ) .",
    "thus , the respective velocity can be expressed as    @xmath124    where , the @xmath125 parameter is the only free parameter of the model .",
    "it seems , however , that it can be determined theoretically in the future .",
    "a similar parameter for description of the hole propagation can be calculated assuming the following proportion :    @xmath126    the velocity @xmath127 follows from the solution of the second fick s law for diffusions of gaussian density distributions : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the diffusion coefficient for electrons .",
    "another process which affects , on average , the widths of the respective gaussian distributions used to describe the charge located in the interval @xmath36 , is related to the transport of the carriers . in order to describe this process",
    "we consider an increase of the variance , @xmath130 , of the gaussian distribution of the charge of @xmath1 particles contained in an interval @xmath131 , with linear density @xmath132 .",
    "let the @xmath133 denote the sum of squares of deviations of particle positions from the average .",
    "in this consideration we neglect the influence of the diffusion and of mutual interactions of clouds on the propagation of the variance .",
    "the change of @xmath134 , resulting from the flow of particles into and out of the cell @xmath131 ( with the net value of @xmath135 ) is , in general , equal to @xmath136 as one can see , in order to find the increment @xmath137 we have to find the increments @xmath135 and @xmath138 .",
    "let us begin with the description of @xmath138 .",

    "knowledge of velocities @xmath121 , @xmath127 and @xmath166 allows to calculate the propagation of the width of the distribution of electrons .",
    "the formulas for holes are analogical .",
    "for the first comparison of the model prediction with the experimental data we choose the data for @xmath167 ion which have already been used in @xcite .",
    "this gives also the opportunity to compare the present model predictions with those obtained in a more phenomenological approach .",
    "for the measurement the neutron transmutation doped ( n - td ) silicon detector @xcite was used . this n - type bulk and extremely thin p - type zone",
    "has a thickness @xmath168 .",
    "the energy measurement was performed using the charge output , while the current pulses were measured using the current output of the same preamplifier , described in @xcite .",
    "this paper presents also in detail the experimental setup and conditions used for the@xmath167 ions ( and lcp ) .    before describing the induced current pulse , we focus first on the propagation of the electric field and the propagation of the electron and hole densities in parallel and perpendicular directions .",
    "the evolution of these observables is important for understanding the mechanism of the plasma delay process . in the following ,",
    "we consider an @xmath167 ion impinging on the n - type rear side of the silicon detector .",
    "this , so called `` rear - mount '' , gives quite different shapes as compared to the `` standard mount '' , and these pulse shapes are much better suited for the psd technique @xcite .",
    "for actual calculations it is necessary to set some physical coefficients describing the electric field propagation , as well as coefficients describing the drift and diffusion process in silicon . in table 1",
    "we collect values of these parameters : @xmath169    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath169    as already mentioned , the electric field propagation results from the static detector bias and from the generated charge density propagation . at the starting point , when the generated electrons and holes are almost exactly at the same positions , the electric field is still equal to the external one ( [ eq : ex - stat ] ) .",
    "this field , for t=0 , is denoted in fig . 2 by a doted line .",
    "after this initial moment the static field causes the shift of the electron and hole distributions and therefore in the next moment some of the carriers are moved outside of the overlap region .",
    "next , the variance of the gaussian partial density distribution associated with these carriers begins to grow , due to the non - compensated electric field in perpendicular direction .",
    "this effect , which is displayed in fig .",
    "3 , causes breaking of the initial bonds between the electrons and holes . as a result ,",
    "the considered electrons and holes start leaking slowly from the overlap region and begin moving in opposite directions . at the same time , the increasing shift between electrons and holes leads to significant reduction of the electric field in the interaction region .",
    "this scenario is well associated with the postulates of the phenomenological model of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the evolution of the charge density , the effective electric field and the variances of the gaussian partial densities are presented in figs 2 - 5 in which the blue lines represent the dependences for the electrons while the red ones represent the holes .",
    "2 shows the evolution of the linear electron and hole densities .",
    "one can see that , during the first 20 - 30 ns , the electrons and holes remain bound in the region close to the detector surface .",
    "after that time , one can observe the electric field restitution practically in the whole detector area .",
    "the time behavior of the electric field is presented in fig .",
    "3 . in order to save the calculation time , the field is calculated only at points where the density of the particles is not equal to zero .",
    "4 presents the evolution of the width of the charge distributions .",
    "we can notice that in the overlap region the effective electric field is reduced to very low value .",
    "as one can see , the evolutions of the electric field and of the charge densities ( in parallel and perpendicular directions ) are strongly correlated .    up to now",
    ", the mutual coulomb interactions between the charge clouds have been taken into account . in order to see the importance of these mutual interactions , they have been neglected in the charge density evolutions presented in fig 5 .",
    "as one can see , in this case , the collection time becomes about tree times shorter , due to the lack of binding between the electrons and holes .",
    "knowledge of the charge propagation , by using of the ramo - shockley theorem @xcite , allowed as to determine the current pulse time dependence .    in order to obtain a rough estimate of the pulse shape",
    ", we describe the partial current associated with the gaussian cloud in approximate way . for simplification , using ramo - shockley theorem , we replace the gaussian charge distribution by a point - like one .",
    "such an approach neglects effects associated with the charge diffuseness , particularly for clouds moving closely to the detector electrodes .",
    "the result of such a calculation is presented in fig 6 .",
    "the total current pulse is denoted by black solid line while the electron and hole contributions are represented by the blue and red ones , respectively .    for comparison of the calculated pulse with the experimental one the primary pulses from fig .",
    "6 . have been corrected ( see [ 3 ] ) for the preamplifier s response .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we have to stress that in the present calculations we did not search for the best value of the @xmath125 parameter .",
    "we also did not consider some quite complicated factors , specified below , which could affect the obtained results and which will be a subject of the forthcoming paper :    \\i ) precision of the energy - range tables ( average accuracy of about 10% , see @xcite ) ,    \\ii ) diffuseness of the gaussian clouds and its presence in the application of the ramo - shockley theorem ,    \\iii ) dead layers of the detector and their effect on the measured energy ( as one can see on fig .",

    "8 we present the correlation between the collection time and the energy loss for @xmath170 , @xmath167 , and @xmath171 ions .",
    "we use the collection time rather than the experimentally preferred rise time , noting that these two observables are strongly correlated .",
    "8 shows that the model can reproduce the experimental trends , especially the characteristic `` back - bending '' of identification curves at low energies .",
    "we have proposed a description of the evolution of charge density and of the effective electric field by taking into account the mutual coulomb interactions between the charge carrier distributions . according to the present approach the plasma delay effect",
    "is associated with the propagation of the carriers in both directions , perpendicular and parallel to the primary ionization path .",
    "the duration of the obtained pulse for the 80 mev @xmath167 ion , corresponds quite well to the one obtained in the physical measurement .",
    "also the shape of the energy - collection time correlation and its element dependence are quite well reproduced by the model .",
    "nevertheless , the model still needs to be confronted with a broader collection of the experimental data obtained for detectors of various thicknesses and biased by various voltages",
    ".    once tested on a broader collection of the experimental pulse shapes , the model will enable the theoretical search for the best identification method based on the pulse shape analysis .",
    "it will also enable the study of the dependence of the identification quality on the detector thickness and maybe on some special construction of the detector with non - linear electric field ( obtained by the heterogeneity of doping ) for regions with poor resolution ( small ion energy , see fig .",
    ". the presented approach should be also suitable for testing the temperature dependence ( via the respective dependence of the diffusion coefficients ) .    in order to draw some more quantitative conclusions from the comparison of the model with the experimental data",
    "one has to estimate the uncertainties related to various possible ingredients , mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "also we have to make an attempt to constrain the single free parameter @xmath125 from the respective classical consideration .",
    "the actual model calculation is quite time consuming . for standard processor the calculation of one pulse associated with the 80 mev @xmath167 ion , takes about 5 hours of cpu , thus some code optimization is still needed .    acknowledgment :    the author is indebted to j. ukasik for careful reading of the manuscript and helpful discussions .",
