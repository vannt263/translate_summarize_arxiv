    "@xmath0-dimensional contact topology has developed drastically .",
    "compared with this , contact topology in higher dimensions has not been studied very much . however ,",
    "in recent few years , there are some remarkable movements on contact topology in higher dimensions .",
    "now , it is expected that considering from the unified perspective would give both @xmath0-dimensional and higher - dimensional contact topology good influences . in this paper , we discuss certain torsions of contact structures in general dimensions .",
    "there are three kinds of notions concerning torsion of contact structures : tightness , week and strong symplectic fillabilities .",

    "two important notions concerning torsion of contact structures , overtwistedness and the giroux torsion , are introduced for contact structures on @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "a _ contact structure _ is a completely non - integrable hyperplane field on an odd - dimensional manifold .",

    "such a disk is called an _ overtwisted disk_. it is known that , if a contact structure is overtwisted , then the contact manifold can not be the boundary of a compact symplectic manifold , in a weak sense ( see @xcite ) .",

    "first , our discussion is based on the following notions introduced by massot , niederkrger , and wendl  @xcite . as a higher - dimensional generalization of an overtwisted disk , a notion of _ bordered legendrian open book _ ( for short ) is introduced ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . roughly speaking",

    "ps - overtwisted_. in addition , as a higher - dimensional generalization of the giroux @xmath16-torsion domain , a notion of _ giroux domain _ is also introduced in  @xcite . roughly , a giroux domain is a contactization of a certain @xmath17-dimensional symplectic manifold with contact - type boundary in a @xmath14-dimensional contact manifold ( see subsection  [ sec : blob_gdom ] for precise definition ) .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that , if there exists a domain that consists of two giroux domains glued together , then the contact manifold can not be the boundary of a compact symplectic manifold in a strong sense ( see theorem  [ thm : mnw_gdom ] for precise statement ) .    a modification of a contact structure on a @xmath0-dimensional manifold so that it has overtwisted disks is the so - called lutz twist ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is a modification along a knot transverse to the contact structure replacing the standard tubular neighborhood @xmath18 with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 sufficiently small , and @xmath22 is a disk with radius @xmath23 ( see subsection  [ sec : lutztwist ] for precise definition ) .",

    "@xmath25 ) , it is called the _ @xmath16-lutz twist _",

    "there exists an important difference between the @xmath16- and @xmath26-lutz twists .",
    "the @xmath16-lutz twist contributes to the euler class of a contact structure , while the @xmath26-lutz twist does not change the homotopy class of a contact structure as plane fields .",
    "in addition to that , a similar modification along a pre - lagrangian torus is also called the lutz twist .",

    "first , we discuss a generalization of the lutz twist along a transverse knot .",
    "the description of the @xmath0-dimensional lutz twist along a transverse knot by contact round surgeries begins with the contact round surgery of index  @xmath36 ( see @xcite or subsubsection  [ sec : revrdsurgrep ] ) .",
    "we generalize this method to higher dimensions .",
    "the first operation that we operate for a @xmath14-dimensional contact manifold is also the contact round surgery of index  @xmath36 .",

    "further , this modification has two versions .",
    "one can be done so that @xmath42 is homotopic to the original contact structure @xmath2 as almost contact structures . the other can be done so that it contributes to the euler class of the contact structure .    in this paper , we call these generalizations of the lutz twist obtained in theorem  [ thm_main ] the _ generalized lutz twist _ along a transverse circle .    other higher - dimensional generalizations of the lutz twist known so far preserve the homotopy class of a contact structure as almost contact structures . on the other hand , the existence of a generalization of @xmath16-lutz twist was an open question ( see @xcite )",
    ". then theorem  [ thm_main ] ( see also proposition  [ prop : cntrbtoe ] ) gives an answer to one of the questions in @xcite .",
