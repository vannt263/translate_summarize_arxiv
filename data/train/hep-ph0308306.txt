    "the principal aim of the study of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is the search for evidences of the state of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the early stage of the reactions@xcite .",
    "a quantity of great interest for the study of the qgp is maximum energy density that has been reached in the experiment .",
    "this maximum energy density is connected with the final state energy density and phase space volume .",
    "for ultra high energy collisions , more than eighty percent of final state particles are pions ; therefore , it is very important to measure the phase space density of pions which can be used to infer the energy density in the early stage of the collisions@xcite . besides this",
    ", it is very important to estimate the phase space density also for the following reasons : ( 1 ) if the boson phase space density is very large , then pions will tend to stay in the same state and pion condensate may occur .",
    "( 2 ) : if the density of pions is very large , then the mean free - length among pions will be small ; therefore , the evolution of pions in the final state should be described by the hydrodynamical equation@xcite .",
    "bertsch suggested a method which uses pion interferometry measurements@xcite to calculate the mean pion phase space density several years ago@xcite . since then several calculations have been done at ags energy@xcite and sps energy@xcite .",

    "but the effects of multi - particle bose - einstein correlations on the mean phase space density have never been studied before .",
    "theoretical studies@xcite have shown that pion interferometry depends strongly on the pion multiplicity distribution which was overlooked in previous hbt analyses .",
