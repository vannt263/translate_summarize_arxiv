    "geodesics in schwarzschild spacetime have been studied for a long time and the importance of a good understanding of their behavior is clear . in this paper we shall focus on analytical calculations involving null geodesics . while these are interesting in their own right , calculations like this are also important for experiments testing general relativity to high levels of accuracy",
    ". examples of two such proposed experiments are `` the laser astrometric test of relativity '' or lator and `` beyond einstein advanced coherent optical network '' or beacon , which are both using paths of light rays to verify general relativity and are described in detail in @xcite . both are intended to measure second order effects in light bending elliptic functions",
    "have been used to describe the geodesics in schwarzschild spacetime before , mainly in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the focus is mainly on the paths of massive particles and even though they mention the possibility of using weierstrass functions in the null case , they do nt go into much detail .",
    "the discussion in @xcite is concerned with null geodesics around a charged neutron star using the reissner - nordstrm metric , a case we also study but with a different emphasis . in this paper",
    "we begin by providing a complete description of schwarzschild null geodesics in terms of weierstrass functions and then , and this is our principal innovation , using various `` addition formulae '' for weierstrass functions @xcite , we derive some analytical formulae connecting values of radial distance at different points along the geodesic .",
    "the motivation is to develop , as far as is possible , optical trigonometry in the presence of a gravitating object such as a star or a black hole . to that end",
    "we use these the additon formulae to study the properties of light triangles in the schwarzschild metric and obtain the deflection angle of the scattering geodesics to second order in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath3 the distance of closest approach of the light ray and @xmath4 the impact parameter .",
    "+ in the final section we show how the same methods to treat null geodesics in more exotic spacetimes ; charged black hole , the ellis wormhole @xcite and schwarzschild black holes in 4 and 6 spatial dimensions .",
    "although not a primary concern of the present paper , it is worth remarking that the addition formulae for weierstrass functions that we make use of are closely related to the existence of an abelian group multiplication law on any elliptic curve @xcite and suggest , in view of the importance of the complex black hole spacetimes at the quantum level , that it might prove fruitful to explore this aspect of the theory further .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 of this paper",
    ", we provide the full solution for schwarzschild null geodesics in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions and apply it to obtain addition formulae connecting three points on the geodesic .",
    "we then calculate the deflection angle of the scattering geodesics to second order in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath3 the distance of closest approach of the light ray and @xmath4 the impact parameter .",
    "the section is concluded with the discussion of the light triangles and gauss - bonnet theorem . in section 3",
    ", we apply the weierstrass function formalism to further examples such as reissner - nordstrm null geodesics and schwarzschild geodesics in more spatial dimensions . at the end of the section",
    ", we give a detailed description of the ellis wormhole null geodesics .",
    "the equation obeyed by a null geodesic @xmath5 in the schwarzschild metric is @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 is the energy of the light , @xmath9 the angular momentum and @xmath4 the impact parameter .",
    "interestingly the same equation arises for a null geodesic @xmath5 in the schwarzschild - de - sitter or kottler metric @xcite@xcite and many of our results remain vaild in that case .",
    "geometrically , one may regard solutions of ( [ eqn ] ) as unparameterised geodesics of the optical metric @xmath10 with @xmath11 . introducting the isotropic",
    "coordinate @xmath12 , we find that @xmath13 where @xmath14 thus our results also apply to light rays moving in an isotropic but inhomogeneous optical medium in flat space with refractive index @xmath15 .",
    "another interpretation of ( [ eqn ] ) , recently exploited in @xcite , is provided by substituting @xmath16 in and differentiating to obtain @xmath17 with @xmath18 now ( [ newton ] ) is the equation governing the motion of a non - relativistic particle of angular momentum per unit mass @xmath19 moving under the influence of a central force @xmath20 . in our case",
    "the effective force @xmath20 is attractive , and varies inversely as the fourth power of the distance .",
    "a search of the voluminous nineteenth century literature on such problems reveals that it was comparatively well known that although this problem admits some simple exact solutions , which we shall detail below , the general solution requires elliptic functions .    if we had adopted isotropic coordinates and substituted @xmath21 we would have obtained a very different formula for @xmath20 .",
    "in fact in that case we would have    @xmath22    as we shall see in detail in a later section , the null geodsics of neutral tangherlini black holes in @xmath23 spacetime dimensions correspond , in schwarzschild coordinates , to the motion of a non - relativistic particle with a force @xmath24 .",
    "the cases @xmath25 are the only cases known to be integrable in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "in fact the cases @xmath26 and @xmath27 may be related by a conformal mapping introduced in his context by bohlin @xcite and elaborated upon by arnold @xcite .",
    "the bohlin - arnold mapping is a type of duality , i.e. it is involutive , and the case @xmath28 is self - dual .",
    "substituting @xmath29 in ( [ eqn ] ) gives @xmath30 where @xmath31 in the case @xmath32 the general solution to this equation is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is weierstrass elliptic function and @xmath35 const .",
    "detailed description of these functions together with the proof of the above statement can be found in @xcite pages 429 - 444 and page 484 .",
    "for the critical values of @xmath36 the equation for @xmath37 can be integrated to give @xmath38 in the case @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the case @xmath41 .",
    "the former , geometrically a _ cardioid _ in @xmath42 coordinates , starts at the singularity , reaches the horizon from below and then returns back .",
    "the latter describes two types of trajectories , one starting at infinity , the other at the singularity and both approaching the photon sphere , never reaching it . +",

    "as shown in @xcite page 440 , weierstrass functions satisfy an addition formula of the form @xmath84 ^ 2 -\\wp(x ) -\\wp(y ) \\equiv f(\\wp(x),\\wp(y ) ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 ^ 2 - x - y \\,.\\ ] ] we can apply this result to null geodesics to obtain an expression for @xmath86 as a function of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . of course ,",
    "if any such formula is to be useful in some experimental setup , we need to be able to easily find the line @xmath61 .",
    "also , because of the additive constant in the argument of the weierstrass function , we can not apply the addition formula directly because the sum of the two arguments will not correspond to the sum of the two angles .",

    "take the scattering orbit for example .",

    "now , letting @xmath95 gives @xmath96 with @xmath97 directly related to the distance of closest approach @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",

    "+   + in the absorbed case , the lack of additive constant in the argument of the weierstrass function means that we can apply the addition formula directly to obtain algebraically simpler result @xmath104 in this case we can use the euclidean angle between the direction of the ray and @xmath65-direction @xmath105 which satisfies @xmath106 then the addition formula can be written as @xmath107 however , in this case this is not very useful since it is practically impossible to identify the line @xmath61 for such a choice .",
    "we could of course make a different choice , like @xmath108 for some chosen @xmath109 , but then the obtained addition formula would not be analytic anymore because we would need to find the corresponding additive constant @xmath110 given by the integral @xmath111      we start from the equation for @xmath112 which is @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath3 is the distance of closest approach , for scattering orbits .",

    "one might hope to get a more precise statement using the addition formulae . to this end ,",
    "let @xmath131 be the physical angle between the direction of the light and the @xmath65 - direction . then @xmath132 note that this formula is valid for the schwarzschild solution but not the kottler solution with non - vanishing cosmological constant @xcite .",

    "[ figure ]    * figure 4 * _ scattering light ray _",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , these have been studied previously using weierstrass functions in @xcite . in this case , the relevant equation for @xmath151 is @xmath152 one may verify using the formulae in @xcite or directly , that just as in the case of the schwarzschild - de - sitter metrics , so with the reissner nordstrm metrics that the cosmological constant does occur in ( [ this ] ) . thus some of the results in @xcite , which appeared on the archive subsequently to the first version of this paper ,",
    "follow directly from the work of the present section .    the r.h.s",

    "however , the more complicated relation between @xmath37 and @xmath46 and also many different constants make it algebraically very challenging to analyze the situation any further and find a suitable @xmath163 or addition formula similar to the schwarzschild case . for that purpose , consider the equation for @xmath164 where @xmath165 is an affine parameter of the path .",

    "then @xmath175 and we can write @xmath176 for some @xmath177 because the path is symmetric . as before , this corresponds to choosing the line @xmath61 to be the axis of symmetry .",
    "we can compute @xmath174 as the largest root of @xmath178 and so we obtain an addition formula @xmath179 for trapped orbits the same addition formula applies , only in that case @xmath174 is the largest attained distance and is given by the second largest root of @xmath178 .",
    "+ if @xmath180 then we have orbits that go in , miss the singularity , and continue to another asymptotically flat region of spacetime .",
    "these satisfy the same addition formula like the scattering ones . in the case",
    "@xmath181 the equation can be integrated and the solution is @xmath182 where @xmath110 is the constant of integration .",
    "another special solutions solutions can be found when @xmath183 which is equivalent to @xmath184 and corresponds to the situation when the two periods of the corresponding weierstrass function become linearly dependent .",
    "this leads to a pair of solutions @xmath185 where @xmath186      here by 5-d it is meant 4 spatial dimensions .",
    "the relevant equation for @xmath187 in this case is @xmath188 where @xmath2 is proportional to the five - dimensional mass .",
    "there is an interesting self - duality here , which is in fact a special case of bohlin - arnold duality , in that when we write the equation in terms of @xmath37 we get @xmath189 which is exactly the same with the constants interchanged .",
    "first consider the equation for @xmath190 .",
    "substitution of @xmath191 will take it into a form @xmath192 where @xmath193 as usual , the r.h.s . of ( [ tthis ] )",
    "has 3 real roots if @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the first condition is @xmath196 while the second is @xmath197 .",
    "therefore we have 4 real roots if @xmath198 .",
    "also , note that the r.h.s.of equation ( 32 ) always has root @xmath199 and expanding it into a power series around this point quickly shows that in fact @xmath200 .",
    "finally , the point @xmath201 corresponds to @xmath56 . hence in this case , with @xmath202 defined as before",
    ", we have 2 classes of solutions , depending on the initial conditions , scattering or trapped .",
    "the case of trapped paths is exactly the same as before , with the same addition formula for @xmath203 and @xmath72 .",
    "however , the scattering case is more interesting in 5d .",
    "this is because now the point @xmath204 in the @xmath205-plane corresponds to @xmath56 and so we can write the solution as @xmath206 where the line @xmath61 is in the direction of the ray incoming from @xmath207 and @xmath208 $ ] .",
    "+ things are even simpler when we solve the equation for @xmath37 directly .",
    "the substitution @xmath209 takes it into the equation ( 32 ) but now the difference is that point @xmath210 corresponds to @xmath56 and so we can write the ( scattering ) solution simply as @xmath211 and the addition formula in this case is simply @xmath212 finally , if @xmath213 then we have only 1 root of the r.h.s . of the weierstrass equation and thus absorbing paths",
    "for which the solution is @xmath214 where again the line @xmath61 is given by the direction of the ray incoming from @xmath207 . + as before , we can get several special solutions by imposing @xmath215 which in this case gives @xmath216 or @xmath217 . in the case @xmath216 we get a special _ circular _ solution @xmath218 while in the case @xmath217 we get @xmath219      by bohlin - arnold duality @xcite , if we have a particle moving in newtonian potential @xmath220 and following trajectory @xmath221 then there will be a particle with accordingly modified energy moving in a potential @xmath222 following trajectory @xmath223 . in this case , if @xmath224 and particle has energy @xmath8 then @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "+ null geodesics in the @xmath227d schwarzschild geometry correspond to newtonian motion in a @xmath228 potential and so the duality applies to these geodesics as well .",
    "as we already saw , the 5-d corresponds to the case @xmath229 and is self dual .",
    "a quick check reveals that the case @xmath230 gives a duality between null geodesics in 7-d and 4-d .",
    "+ given the potential @xmath231 , newton s equation of motion is @xmath232 the equation for null geodesics in 4-d is @xmath233 and in 7-d it is @xmath234    so , under the duality with @xmath230 we have @xmath235 and thus @xmath236 .",
    "therefore if we have 4-d black hole with mass @xmath2 and light with @xmath237 following the trajectory @xmath5 and 7-d black hole with mass @xmath238 and light with @xmath239 following the trajectory @xmath240 then @xmath241 making the substitution @xmath242 in the equation for @xmath37 in the 7-d case takes it into the weierstrass form with @xmath243 and + @xmath244 .",

    "this choice corresponds to setting the line @xmath61 to be the axis of symmetry and @xmath319 where @xmath320 * .",
    "then @xmath321 we know that in this case all orbits are incoming from @xmath207 and reach @xmath70 .",
    "both @xmath322 and @xmath323 correspond to unphysical ( complex ) @xmath37 and this time , @xmath324 corresponds to @xmath273 without any ambiguity .",
    "suppose we have an orbit starting at @xmath207 .",
    "@xmath312 and so we need to choose plus sign in the relation @xmath309 .",
    "+ thus @xmath325 , then @xmath326 and finally we reach @xmath327 .",
    "but if we continued the same weierstrass function solution now @xmath37 would begin to increase again , which we know is unphysical . therefore we need to switch the branches and continue with minus sign in the relation @xmath309 so that we reach @xmath328 .",
    "now there is no way of continuing the solution and we need to start a new one , first using a minus sign and then a plus sign on its journey from @xmath70 to @xmath56 .",
    "therefore an orbit going from @xmath207 to @xmath70 travels a total angle @xmath329 and satisfies @xmath330 where again line @xmath61 is in the direction of the ray incoming from @xmath207 .     + ( i ) note that the scattering solutions depend directly on @xmath331 and so the addition formula for weierstrass functions can be applied directly .",
    "+ ( ii ) the same is true for the absorbing one , however we need to be careful to stay in the region @xmath332 or @xmath333 when applying it .",
    "the equation for @xmath190 can be factorized as @xmath334 now , the distance of closest approach is @xmath335 , which corresponds to @xmath336 let @xmath337 be half of the angle @xmath65 travelled by the light . @xmath338 making the substitution @xmath339 , we have @xmath340 write @xmath341 for the final integrand above .",
    "it is straightforward to differentiate @xmath342 n times w.r.t .",
    "@xmath296 and the result is @xmath343 therefore we can expand @xmath342 as @xmath344 scattering orbits exist for @xmath345 and for this range of values of @xmath296 the sum converges uniformly ( for example by straightforward application of the weierstrass m - test ) and therefore we can write @xmath346 the integral in this sum can be computed by hand , one way is as follows .",
    "the volume @xmath347 of an @xmath348-dimensional ball @xmath349 therefore @xmath350 now using the identity @xmath351 gives @xmath352 this can be further simplified using the identity @xmath353 to give @xmath354 now the angle of deflection @xmath68 is given by @xmath355 and so @xmath356 the first few terms of this expansion are @xmath357 with @xmath358 . + we have also tried expanding the deflection angle in terms of @xmath359 following @xcite . substituting @xmath360 into the integral ( @xmath361 ) and expanding in the powers of @xmath118 , using mathematica , the first few terms are @xmath362 this expansion is not very useful , since the coefficients do nt seem to be decreasing very fast , the coeff . of @xmath363 is almost 1 .",

    "in this paper , we have used weierstrass elliptic functions to give a full description and and classification of null geodesics in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we then used this description to derive some analytical formulae connecting three points on these geodesics and found second order expansion of the deflection angle in the scattering case .",
    "finally , we derived some properties of light triangles in this spacetime and used the gauss - bonnet theorem to derive a quantity which gives the same answer when integrated along a scattering geodesic , independently of the geodesic in question .",
    "+ we then showed that the weierstrass elliptic function formalism can also be used to describe other more exotic spacetimes such as reissner - nordstrm null geodesics and schwarzschild null geodesics in spacetimes with spatial dimensions 4 and 6 . in all these cases ,",
    "the elliptic function approach allows one to find the special case analytical solutions with ease ( simply by looking at the values of parameters for which the elliptic function in question collapses into a periodic one ) .",
    "+ finally we applied the formalism to describe the null geodesics of the ellis wormhole and found an expansion for the angle of deflection in this case .",
    "after the appearance of the first verson of this paper on the archive , betti hartmann pointed out to us that our results may easily extended to the case of a schwarzschild black hole pierced by an infinitely cosmic string studied in @xcite .",
