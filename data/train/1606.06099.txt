    "in the wireless wiretap scheme two legitimate communication parties , alice and bob , exchange information in the presence of an _ eavesdropper _ , eve . in this setting , the communication parties rely on physical layer security rather than cryptographic protocols .",
    "hence , eve is assumed to have no computational limitations and know the cryptographic key , if any , but to have a worse signal quality than bob .",
    "the objective of code design in a wiretap channel is to maximize the data rate and bob s correct decoding probability while minimizing eve s information .",
    "it was shown in the seminal paper of wyner @xcite that the legitimate parties can design codes with asymptotically non - zero rate , zero error probability and zero information leakage .",
    "today , this setup is particularly interesting in wireless channels that are open in nature but vulnerable to distortions    as a practical construction of a wiretap code , @xcite introduced the general technique of _ coset coding _",
    ", where random bits are added to the message to confuse the eavesdropper . in the specific case of a wireless channel , where lattice codes are suitable , the code lattice @xmath0 is endowed with a sublattice @xmath1 which carries the random bits @xcite .",
    "the security of lattice coset codes can be quantized either by eve s correct decision probability , or alternatively by the mutual information of the message and eve s received signal .",
    "for the _ additive white gaussian noise _ ( awgn ) channel , upper bounds are known for both approaches @xcite and , more importantly , both are increasing functions of the _ flatness factor _ of the lattice @xmath2 . sequences of lattice coset codes achieving security and reliability are also constructed in @xcite .    for fading channel models , probability and information bounds were derived in @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "codes achieving security and reliability in the _ multiple - input multiple - output _ ( mimo ) channel were given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we recall the strategy of @xcite and give a variant of the information bounds . with this streamlined introductory computation",
    ", we obtain bounds which are increasing functions of the expected flatness factor of the faded lattice related to the eavesdropper .",
    "the agreement of the probability and information approaches is hence explicit , and a natural and explicit generalization of the awgn case .",
    "the computations hold in any channel model with linear fading and gaussian noise .",
    "we remark that , to the best of our knowledge , the steps towards practical code designs in low dimensions , such as @xcite , are based on the probability bounds .    motivated by this ,",
    "we show how to use an approximation of the theta series of a lattice , recently derived in @xcite , to efficiently compute the average flatness factor of a given lattice .",
    "hence , we do not need to rely on further approximations for the information / probability bounds , _",
    "e.g. _ , the common approach using the _ inverse norm sum _ in siso channels @xcite .",
    "we exemplify this in the rayleigh fast fading channel , and see an agreement between our numerical computations and the geometric design heuristics and simulations results in @xcite . in particular , this agreement supports the expectation that the flatness factor not only _ bounds _ but also _ orders correctly _ the performance of different lattices , hence serving as a design criterion for practical low - dimensional constructions , as first suggested in @xcite . comparing to @xcite , where average flatness factor heuristics are tested with simulations ,",
