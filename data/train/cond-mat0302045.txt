    "in a previous paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as i , the authors have developed a simple model describing the main features shown by a quantum wire , namely : band structure when the structure is periodically arranged , anderson localization in the random case and easy calculation of lyapunov exponents , density of electronic states and electrical conductance endowed with an encouraging fractal behaviour .",
    "we address the interested reader to reference i for the details of the model and the intrincacies of the computer calculations .",
    "the main drawback of the scheme thereby presented was the lack of a coherent description of the possible correlations which must be present in any realistic model of one dimensional conductance .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to fill this gap by presenting a surprisingly simple way to incorporate correlations entirely based upon the random nature of the model .",
    "this means that in addition to describe correlations with different parameters of the wire ( spacing , number and amount of species , ... ) the model is flexible enough to be suitable for applying it to different correlation schemes such as the tight - binding model , the anderson model and likely many others correlation prescriptions with sensible physical content .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we analyze the meaning of the correlations in terms of probabilities of a given atom to be followed by other of a different character .",
    "after this analysis we are able to set some limits for the values of these probabilities . the next step is to incorporate those probabilities to the functional equation developed in i. how this functional equation is modified by the introduction of correlations in the way just described and how it can be used to calculate the correlation - corrected lyapunov exponent is the subject of section 2 . in section 3",
    "some results are shown along with a discussion about the effects of the correlations to close finally with a section of conclusions .",
    "let us consider disordered quantum wires with short - range correlations which will be specified by the probability for a certain atomic species to be followed by another type of atom in the chain sequence . in this model",
    ", the system will be characterized by the species concentrations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of different species , and the set @xmath2 where @xmath3 means the probability for @xmath4 to be followed by @xmath5 ( the prob . of finding @xmath5 right after @xmath4 ) .",
    "the correlations introduced in this way must be the consequence of the existence of an atomic interaction ( or the effect of some physical parameters such as the size of the atoms ) which might choose certain spatial sequences of the atoms modifying subtly the otherwise chain s purely random character .",
    "thus this procedure seems a natural manner to account for correlations which can be present in nature or even those that can be produced inside a manufactured disordered quantum wire in a nonintentional way aside from the fact that of course one can always try to construct a wire exhibiting the desired correlations to recover the theoretical results .",
    "let us clarify the meaning of @xmath3 .",
    "it is the ratio of the number of -@xmath6- clusters and the number of @xmath4 atoms ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath3 is not the probability for @xmath5 to be preceded by @xmath4 , because the latter would be obtained dividing by the number of @xmath5 atoms ( @xmath8 ) instead of @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath9",
    ", the system will be determined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 and therefore the density of states will be given by a limiting distribution depending only on those quantities . and that distribution is of course the same whether we move from left to right or from right to left along the chain .",
    "so , the correlations we measure have to coincide in both directions .",
    "then it is clear that _ for the infinite chain @xmath3 means the probability for an @xmath4 species atom to be followed or preceded by a @xmath5 species atom .",
    "_    once we have understood the meaning of the correlations , let us derive the relations among them .",
    "what is the probability of finding at any position of the chain the cluster -iji- ?",
    "we can write this quantity as , @xmath12 thus the equations for the correlations are ,    [ eq : corre ] @xmath13    according to the equations , the correlations matrix @xmath14 is completely known from the above diagonal elements , @xmath15 where @xmath1 is the number of different species",
    ". however these elements are not completely independent due to , because when one of the correlations is chosen , the maximum allowed value for some of the rest may be affected .",
    "this fact can be clearly seen in two simple examples :    the matrix is completely determined by @xmath16 , @xmath17 but it must be @xmath18 .",
    "therefore .",
    "the matrix is determined by @xmath19 .",
    "and we choose their values in that order .    which implies    .",
    "on the other hand it must be , @xmath20 therefore .",
    "an expression for the general form of the maximum values can be obtained for arbitrary @xmath1 . choosing the above diagonal elements of the correlations matrix by rows , @xmath21 then @xmath22 where the limits are given by the previous chosen correlations .",
    "once the concentrations and @xmath23 are fixed , the characterization of the quantum wire can be given in a compact form using the matrix @xmath24 which is symmetric ( @xmath25 ) and it determines uniquely the wire and its correlations : @xmath26 @xmath27 means the probability of finding the cluster -ij-",
    "( -ji- ) at any position inside the wire .",
    "this model naturally includes the situation in which the disorder in the wire is completely random , that is just defined by the values @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : space ] shows an example of the correlation space for 2 species .    [ fig : space ]",
    "we will now obtain the correlation form of the functional equation , which enable us to calculate the density of states . in this process",
    "we are using some of the results and expressions obtained in reference i.    the relations for the phase transmission inside the wire read ,    [ eq : tinverse ] @xmath29    where @xmath30 . to carry out the phase average we rearrange the terms depending on the species of the last atom we have passed , @xmath31 where @xmath7 is the number of atoms of species @xmath4 and the sumatory over @xmath32 means we are summing over all the positions @xmath5 such that the atom at @xmath33 is of @xmath4-kind : @xmath34 from now on the greek indices will refer to species while the latin indices mean the sites of the chain . in this case there",
    "exist correlations in the sequence of atoms , that is the probability for one species to be a neighbour of another type can be different for all of them .",
    "this implies that each species will give rise to a particular distribution function for the phase .",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distribution function of the phase at the position @xmath5 generated by the species @xmath37 .",
    "the equations for the distributions ( ( b.14 ) in i ) become here ,    @xmath38    for all species and positions , where the superscript `` @xmath39 '' means that we do not know the species of the atom preceding the @xmath37 atom , placed at position @xmath33 ; we only know the probability for a certain species to be there .",
    "let us introduce now the average over all possible sequences with the given concentrations .",
    "@xmath40 and , @xmath41 the next step consists in taking the limit @xmath9 to approach the limiting distribution .",
    "we define @xmath42 which is the solution of :    [ eq : wcorre ] @xmath43    and finally we have to calculate , @xmath44 to carry out the integral we shall make use of the existence of a value @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , and proceeding by parts , @xmath47 to evaluate the middle term we use the average of equations which is @xmath48 with a simple change of variable , the use of and the equations for the correlations we can write , @xmath49 and going back to , @xmath50 it is not hard to see with the help of that the last term is @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 thus the density of states reads ( ( b.8 ) in i ) , @xmath53 which can be calculated numerically solving eqs . for several values of the energy .",
    "the quantity that provides information about the degree of spatial localization of the electronic states is the lyapunov exponent , which gives the exponential growth rate of the wave function , and thus its inverse is a measure of the localization length of a state exponentially localized inside the wire .",
    "the lyapunov coefficient can be written for the infinite wire as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the amplitude of the wave function at the @xmath5th atomic site . using a mapping technique originally proposed in ref .",
    "we are able to write @xmath56 as a function of the phase ( appendix [ ap : lya ] ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 stands for the species of the @xmath5th atom . due to the periodicity of @xmath60",
    "we can use the distribution functions of the phase to calculate the average : @xmath61 from this last expression one can obtain numerically the lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy .",
    "once we have built the mathematical framework lying under the model , one can try to answer the physical questions that obviously arise from this new configuration of the disordered quantum wire : how strong is the effect of this short - range correlations ? , does it produce a measurable change in the density of states or in the localization of the electrons ?",
    "as in ref .",
    "i , we solve the functional equation numerically to obtain the density of states and to calcultate the lyapunov exponent .",
    "it seems really hard to find analytical solutions for equations if they exist at all .",
    "let us analize in the first place the density of states ( dos ) for our quantum wires . in figure",
    "[ fig : evolution ] the evolution of the dos for a binary wire as a function of the correlation @xmath16 is shown for a certain value of the concentrations .",
    "this distribution of states is drastically changed from the initial situation in which the probability to find the cluster -12- is low to the final stage when we impose the atoms of species 1 to appear always isolated .",
    "note however that the concentrations are the same in both cases!. another example can be seen in figure [ fig:4species ] for a wire composed of 4 species . as the number of species increases , the number of correlations grows as @xmath15 , and the distribution of states can adopt a lot of different shapes : the exploration of the whole correlations and concentrations space for @xmath62 can take a long time . from these graphics we conclude that the correlations can unbalance the spectra of the disorder system quite far from the completely random configuration .",
    "in fact the correlation can be tuned to open ( close ) an energy gap or to increase ( decrease ) the number of available states in a certain energy interval without changing the concentrations of the atomic components .",
    "the variation of the dos with the correlations is of course a function of the concentrations being the chain with homogenized participation the one whose distribution has the strongest dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "let us also remark that the fractal behaviour of the density of states in certain energy ranges , reported in reference i , still manifests itself for the different correlations regimes .",
    "let us have a look at the localization of the electronic states . in figures [ fig : lya1 ] and [ fig : lya2 ]",
    "the behaviour of the lyapunov exponent for a binary chain changing the correlations and the concentrations is shown . in figure [ fig:4species ]",
    "the different shapes of the degree of localization for different correlations can also be noticed for a 4-species wire . the effective influence of the correlations on the localization of the electrons inside the quantum wires is established . in the study of correlated disorder two main kinds of correlations have been taken into account namely short - range and long - range .",
    "the former , mainly represented by the random dimer model @xcite , has been widely accepted to be the reason for the emergence of resonant energies and a set of states close to the resonant one for which the localization length becomes larger that the system size @xcite , improving greatly the transport properties @xcite .",
    "the long - range correlations seem to be able to include in the spectrum mobility edges @xcite , that can be entirely controlled by the correlators @xcite , yielding an energy interval of a complete transparency . in our type of wires",
    "we have not observed mobility edges nor resonant energies . however",
    "an important effect on the localization of the states is shown that seems to act globaly in the whole energy range in contrast to the more restricted effect of others short - range correlated disorder models .",
    "in fact for certain energies the lyapunov exponent can be decreased an 80 - 90% of its maximun value changing the correlations at the expense of an increasing behaviour for other energies .",
    "whether these correlations might cause @xmath56 to go below the inverse of the length of a finite sample for some energy intervals is not certainly clear but it could be a point for future discussions .",
    "one can now argue if this influence of the correlations on the localization as well as on the dos will be a measurable effect on short finite wires that represent a simple practical implementation , or on the contrary is just theoretically achievable only in infinite unreal systems .",
    "in order to answer that question and ascertain ourselves of the importance of the results we learn to generate finite sequences showing this kind of correlations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : finite ] we show the lyapunov exponent of an infinite wire for a certain concentration and correlation calculated using the functional equation , and the one obtained numerically from equation for a correlated disordered chain of 1000 atoms .",
    "the convergence is excellent with only one realization of the correlated disorder using one thousand of atoms , and we have also checked it for others couplings of the species and other correlations obtaining a high degree of agreement .",
    "thus it means that the described results are real effects with some practical importance on experimental realizations and on the other hand that the method of the functional equation , although designed for an infinite wire , can reproduce quite well the tendency in finite samples .",
    "to summarize , we have extended the model proposed in reference i and completed the formalism introduced there including the possible correlations which must be present in any realistic model of one dimensional conductance .",
    "the method described here is the most natural manner to account for correlations that can manifest in nature or even inside a manufactured quantum wire in a nonintentional way .",
    "it has been established how due to the correlated disorder the density of states is essentially modified and the localization of the electronic states changes in a non negligible proportion which might alter some macroscopic properties of these structures .",
    "in addition to the obtained results we are preparing a future report in which we will construct the functional equation formalism in a more coherent way relating it to others methods currently used . there it will be shown how this mathematical framework is flexible enough to be suitable for applying it to different disorder models such as the tight - binding model as well as other correlation schemes such as the random dimer .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the support provided by the research in science and technology agency of the spanish goverment ( * dgicyt * ) under contract * bfm2002 - 02609*.",
    "it can be shown that the electronic wave function satisfies , @xmath63 where @xmath55 is the amplitude of the wave function at the @xmath5th atomic site of the chain .",
    "this equation can be visualized as a two dimensional mapping in polar coordinates with the identification @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 which yields the known transmission relationship for the phase and the following for the moduli @xmath67 , @xmath68 if now we introduce the polar coordinates into the definition of the lyapunov exponent we obtain : @xmath69 because according to the meaning of @xmath56 the cosinus term must be zero . and using we can calculate the lyapunov coefficient as a function of the phase , as : @xmath70 which is our expression .",
