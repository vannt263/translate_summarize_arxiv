    "one of the major pending cosmological problem for the formation of galaxies and clusters , their distribution and evolution , is the relation of the latter with the initial conditions prevailing in the early universe . to this sake ,",
    "most of the observational constraints are relative to the luminous part of the universe . on the other hand , theoretical model of primordial fluctuations",
    "are for the matter distribution . whether light traces matter , so that the former can be used to constrain the latter , has been a long debate over the past decade .",
    "it was clear that from the constraint on the small - scale peculiar velocity dispersion of galaxies ( davis & peebles 1983 ) , matter can not trace light ( kaiser 1984 , davis et al .",
    "1985 , schaeffer & silk 1985 ) if the density of the universe is to be equal to the critical density .    that galaxies might be biased with respect to the matter field",
    "has therefore been quite popular in the past years especially in the frame of the cold dark matter cosmological model .",
    "standard cdm model provides indeed enough power at small scale for hierarchical clustering to occur but it does not not produce enough power at large scales , when correctly normalized at small scales , to explain the large scale galaxy counts ( saunders et al .",
    "1991 , davis et al .",
    "this problem has been confirmed by the measurement of the very large scale cosmological fluctuations by smoot et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "it is therefore now customary to work within the assumption of a low - density universe ( with a possible cosmological constant ) , that preserves the hierarchical clustering scenario , and with the idea that light might trace matter .",
    "it is then crucial to understand the possible existence of biases at smaller scales and their possible variation with scale to establish reliable constraints on the shape of the power initial spectrum .",
    "bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) proposed a mechanism for the galaxies to be more correlated that the matter .",
    "it relies of the correlation properties of the peaks in the initial gaussian density field .",
    "this approach was further extended by mo , jing & white ( 1997 ) .",
    "the idea is that galaxies form at the location of the density peaks and thus are biased from the beginning compared to the whole matter field .",
    "however such a description is far from being complete since the subsequent complex dynamical evolution of the density field is ignored . at scales",
    "up to 8 @xmath5 the density field is completely nonlinear so that the statistical properties of the peaks appearing in the initial gaussian fluctuation may have been completely transformed .",
    "we present below arguments that take into account the nonlinear evolution of the matter field to show that the halos in such an evolved density field indeed are distributed differently than the matter .",
    "but _ definitely not _ in the way predicted by gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we present the complete correlation properties that are to be expected and the expression of the biases that appear at various levels in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the small - scale power law behavior of the galaxy correlation function is specific to hierarchical clustering scenarios and arises from the nonlinear instabilities in an expanding universe .",
    "the value of the small - scale power law index is likely to come from the shape of the primordial power spectrum ( davis & peebles 1977 ) .",
    "some authors , however , ( saslaw & hamilton 1984 ) propose an explanation based on thermodynamical arguments to explain the emergence of such a power law behavior . in any case",
    "it is thought to be due of a relaxation process in the nonlinear regime . generalizing a relation of peebles ( 1980 ) , hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) propose ( see also valageas & schaeffer 1997 -hereafter vs97- ) a universal transformation to get the evolved non - linear two - point correlation function from the initial spectrum , based on empirical observations in numerical simulations .",
    "the strength of the matter two - body correlation function is obviously an important information to derive the initial matter power spectrum , but the differences between linear regime and nonlinear regime is unlikely to be reducible solely to a transformation of the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "indeed the observed three - point correlation function of the galaxies , for instance , also takes a specific form , as product of two two - body correlation functions ( groth & peebles 1977 ) and can provide alternative checks for the scenario of structure formation .",
    "these features can not be predicted by analytical calculations using the simple linear approximation with initial gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this failure is not due to inapproriate initial conditions but to the fact that the linear approximation is inadequate .",
    "perturbative calculations introducing higher order of the overdensity field have demonstrated that the gravity can induce a full hierarchy of correlations starting with gaussian initial conditions ( fry 1984b , bernardeau 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the scaling due to hierarchical clustering can be expressed through the behavior of the mean @xmath6-body connected correlation functions of the matter field within a volume @xmath7 , @xmath8 , as a function of the two - body one ( see balian & schaeffer 1989 -hereafter bas89- for a description of this statistical tools ) .",
    "this relation can be written , @xmath9^{p-1},\\eqno(1.1)\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath10 are independent of the scale .",
    "when the fluctuations are small ( @xmath11 ) , one can derive the full series of the coefficients @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately such results in the quasi - gaussian regime are irrelevant for the fully nonlinear regime where numerous shell crossings and relaxation processes have to be taken into account .",
    "explanations for the observed structures describing the dynamics of pressure - less particles in gravitational interaction that do not assume the existence of coherent velocity flows are to be invoked .",
    "this hierarchy of equations ( the born , bogolubov , green , kirkwood , yvon -bbgky- hierarchy ) concerns the @xmath6-body density functions ( in the full phase space ) and has been established by peebles ( 1980 ) for matter in an expanding universe .",
    "it can not be solved in general , although there exist some interesting attempts ( hamilton 1988b , balian & schaeffer 1988 , hamilton et al .",
    "1991 ) but admit the so - called self - similar solutions ( davis & peebles 1977 ) .",
    "the latter solutions contain a precious indication since it can be shown that , in the limit of large fluctuations , a similar relationship as in ( 1.1 ) is expected to occur between the mean correlation functions .",
    "models of matter fluctuations in which such a behavior is seen are called hierarchical models .",
    "that such solutions are relevant for the evolved density field was also not obvious and had been the subject of many papers . after the success of early models ( schaeffer 1984 , 1985 ) ,",
    "a complete description of the properties that are to be expected for the counts in cell was given by bas89 ( see  2.2.1 of this paper for a very short review ) .",
    "these predictions have now been widely checked , for points in numerical simulations ( see valageas , lacey & schaeffer 1999 ) and in catalogues ( see benoist et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we take now for granted that the hierarchy ( 1.1 ) holds    for the analysis of galaxy catalogues , however , it is more or less assumed that the galaxy field traces the underlying density field , or at least that the properties of the matter should be preserved in the galaxy field .",
    "the question we then have to address is to confidently relate properties concerning matter distributions to observational statistical quantities such as the two and three - point galaxy or cluster correlation functions , their cross - correlations or the galaxy and cluster void probability functions ... in the gaussian approximation , the knowledge of the @xmath6-body density functions reduces to the behavior of the two - body function . the bias ,",
    "measuring the ratio of the strength of the two - point correlation function of the galaxies to the one of the matter is then the only relevant parameter , as stressed previously , to quantify the departure between mass fluctuations and would - be light fluctuations .",
    "it appears to be a crucial parameter to constrain the cosmological models .",
    "however , the actual departure between galaxy distribution and matter distribution can not be reduced to this sole parameter .",
    "more generally we have to search how the @xmath6-body correlation functions are modified for the observed galaxy distribution .    previous work ( bernardeau & schaeffer 1991 -hereafter bes91- , vs97 , valageas & schaeffer 1998 ) suggests a natural way to identify the visible objects among the matter fluctuations .",
    "it is based on the assumption that dissipative processes are epiphenomena that do not modify the distribution of matter , but just mark , with luminous stars , the dense matter concentrations . at scales smaller than the correlation length it appears",
    "( bas89 ) that most of the volume of the universe is ( nearly ) empty whereas a small fraction of its volume contains almost all the matter .",
    "the latter fraction of the universe is identified with the observed luminous objects .",
    "it happens that there is a unique parameter that governs the mass distribution function of the objects , @xmath12 where @xmath1 is the mass of the object , @xmath13 the mean mass density of the universe , @xmath7 the volume of the objects and @xmath14 the mean value of the matter two - point correlation function within a cell of volume @xmath7 .",
    "as @xmath14 is seen to behave as @xmath15 where @xmath2 is the size of the object and @xmath3 , the power - law index of the two - body correlation function is close to 1.8 , @xmath16 scales as @xmath17 and is then nearly proportional to the internal velocity dispersion of these objects , ( which by definition are supposed to be dense enough to be virialized ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is then to show how the galaxy and cluster correlations are related to the fluctuations of the matter density in the deeply nonlinear regime . in practice",
    ", we divide the universe into cells and calculate the correlation function of those cells containing a given amount of matter ( above a rather small minimum ) . in the following",
    "we may refer to these dense cells as `` halos '' .",
    "all the calculations have been done for hierarchical models .",
    "more specifically we introduced the tree - hierarchical models for which a complete description of the biases can be derived .",
    "these models form a large part of the hierarchical models where the many - body correlation functions behave as a power of scale , and can be parameterized as products of the two - body correlation functions .",
    "they are described in sect .",
    "[ nonlinbe ] .",
    "a calculation of the bias parameter was performed ( schaeffer 1985 , 1987 ) using specific tree - hierarchical based models . in a previous paper bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 , hereafter bes92 ) performed the calculation of the two- and three - point correlation functions of the dense spots in the matter field using a much more general form of tree - hierarchical models .",
    "these calculations were recently extended by munshi et al .",
    "( 1998b ) up to the 6-point functions exploiting the same techniques and models .",
    "once again the scaling parameter @xmath16 was seen to play a central role .",
    "the bias , the parameter @xmath18 measuring the strength of the three - point correlation function for halos , were both shown to depend only on their internal scaling parameter @xmath16 . in sect .",
    "[ genfunc ] of this paper we present the generalization of these results to the correlations at any order .",
    "the complete @xmath6-body correlations of condensed objects are thus derived from the matter @xmath6-body correlation functions .",
    "[ models ] is devoted to the discussion of the various possible models , still within the tree form for the matter correlations , that can be realistically ( or less realistically ) used to describe the matter field .",
    "the range of the prediction for the halo correlations depending on which model is adopted is discussed in great detail .    in sect .",
    "[ obscons ] we discuss various possible applications of these results , that may be checked either in galaxy catalogues or in numerical simulations .",
    "we consider the first few moments of the counts of objects , the void probability functions .",
    "special care is devoted to the determination of the mass multiplicity function of halos in over - dense areas ( rich clusters ) .    in the last section we strike the balance of what have been obtained and present some possible developments .",
    "the mathematical aspects of the derivations are given in the appendices .",
    "preliminary account of this work , that contains all the major results presented here , has been given by bernardeau ( phd thesis , paris 1992 ) .",
    "after near final completion of this paper , we learned about the overlapping work by munshi et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "we assume that the correlation functions in the matter field follow a hierarchical pattern as in eq .",
    "more precisely we assume that there are solutions of the equations of motion for the dynamical evolution of the matter distribution , for which all many - body correlation functions exhibit a scaling law , @xmath19^{p-1}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hmove \\ \\",

    "the scaling laws shown in this equation are valid for an einstein - de sitter universe and power - law initial conditions . for the latter , in case of @xmath23 , an other similar scaling is reached in which the coefficient @xmath24 appearing in equation ( 2.1 ) has to be changed in 1 , @xmath25^{p-1}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hmove \\ \\",
    "\\times \\disp{\\xi_p(\\vr_1,\\dots,\\vr_p , t ) } , \\eqno(2.2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which only changes the time dependence of these functions ( balian & schaeffer 1988 ) . the latter have argued that , provided either @xmath26 or @xmath27 so that the above solutions exist , they may be reached for more general initial conditions .",
    "numerical simulations show ( davis et al .",
    "1985 , bouchet et al . 1991 ,",
    "colombi et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 , munshi et al . 1998a , valageas et al . 1999 ) that ( 2.1 ) is indeed relevant at late times , at least for @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "the matter correlation functions can not be obtained from observation , but the galaxy correlations for @xmath28 also are seen to obey eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) ( for the scale dependence ) .",
    "it is thus fair to assume that either eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) or eq . ( [ 2.2 ] ) holds also for the higher @xmath6-body correlation functions , and can be used as a model to describe the matter fluctuations in the nonlinear regime .",
    "once the two - point correlation function is assumed to obey ( 2.1 ) or ( 2.2 ) , a further simplification can be introduced by assuming that @xmath20 can be written as a product of @xmath29 two - body correlation functions , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a particular tree topology ( fig .",
    "1 ) connecting the @xmath6 points without making any loop , @xmath32 is a particular labeling of the @xmath6 points by the coordinates @xmath33 , the sum corresponding to all different possible labelings for the given topology @xmath31 and the last product is made over the @xmath29 links between the @xmath6 points with two - body correlation functions .",
    "we note for later use that , for each topology @xmath31 , we can list the number of vertices having a given number , @xmath34 , of outgoing lines , @xmath35 .",
    "the weight @xmath36 is independent of time and is a homogeneous function of the positions , @xmath37 associated with the order of the correlation and the topology involved .",
    "several attempts have been made using the form ( 2.3 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath36 are generally assumed to be independent of the coordinates @xmath21 , and sometimes also , for simplicity , to be independent of @xmath38 .",
    "for instance schaeffer ( 1984 , 1985 ) uses @xmath39 , constant or moderately increasing with @xmath6 , justified on observational grounds , so as to produce enough power towards the small masses ( power - law increase ) and a slow enough fall - off of the induced multiplicity function , which must not be faster than exponential .",
    "this implies a very strong growth , as @xmath40 , of the @xmath6-body correlation function amplitude .",
    "fry ( 1984a ) proposed @xmath41 , decreasing roughly like @xmath42 as a solution of the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "this implies correlation functions that grow at most as a power of @xmath6 .",
    "the associated mass function , for counts far from the mean , then differs by several orders of magnitude from the previous one .",
    "this result , however , was obtained by means of approximations that were later seen ( hamilton 1988b ) to be unjustified , the accumulated error on @xmath43 being precisely of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "the latter found an approximate solution where @xmath36 vanishes for all tree topologies , except for the particular line - topology , for which @xmath44 , indeed of moderate variation as a function of @xmath6 since @xmath45 , in this case , is of order unity .",
    "there are , however , strong observational constraints on these coefficients due to the fact that they determine the shape of the mass function of objects ( schaeffer 1984 , 1985 , bas89 , bes91 , vs97 ) . for instance",
    "the solution proposed by hamilton ( 1988b ) is seen to produce still too sharp a cut - off at high masses ( although exponential , as desired ) as well as at low masses , where the power - law behavior is lacking and is not realistic enough .",
    "for this reason , bas89 made a study valid for all models that satisfy a well - established set of known constraints arising either from mathematical consistency ( such as the positivity of probabilities ) or from the requirement that the mass function should look like the schechter ( 1976 ) function .",
    "the model proposed by schaeffer as well as the form proposed by hamilton are both a particular case of a more general form , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant weight associated to a vertex of the tree topology with @xmath34 outgoing lines .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is then obtained by the product on all the weights associated with the topology @xmath31 . the form ( 2.5 ) , assumed to hold for the matter correlations , has been used ( bes92 ) to calculate the two- and three - body correlation functions for galaxies or clusters .",
    "we call it here the _ minimal tree - hierarchical model_. this form is supported by numerical evidences for at least the bi - spectrum which is found to be very weakly dependent on the geometry in the nonlinear regime ( see scoccimarro et al",
    ". 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "this is also assumed for the construction of the so - called hyperextended perturbation theory model ( scoccimarro & frieman 1999 ) .",
    "but the aim of this article is to find the relation between the distribution of the matter and the luminous ( dense ) objects , using the most general possible form for the many - body correlation functions compatible with ( 2.3 ) .",
    "the most general form that is relevant to the kind of calculations we develop in this paper is of the form @xmath48 the product being over all vertices associated to the tree - topology @xmath31 ; the position of the @xmath49 vertex is at @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the coordinates of the end - points of its @xmath34 outgoing lines .",
    "the function @xmath52 is supposed to be an homogeneous function of the positions . in general",
    "it is then supposed that the weight associated to the vertices may depend not only on the number of outgoing lines as in the minimal models , but also on the geometry of these lines such as their relative angles , or the ratios of their lengths .",
    "this very general form of the correlations will be referred to as the _ tree hierarchical model_.    if there is no definitive proof that the many - body correlation functions take the form ( 2.6 ) in the strongly nonlinear regime , this kind of structure is however obtained in the quasi - linear regime ( fry 1984b , bernardeau 1992 ) where the correlation functions follow a tree like pattern . in the following",
    "we will mention the properties that are specifically due to the hypothesis ( 2.6 ) once the form ( 2.1 ) has been assumed .      to calculate the number density of the dense and under - dense cells as a function of the mass ( , the number of matter particles ) it has been shown ( bas89 ) that it is sufficient to know the average of the many - body correlations within a cell , as is exemplified by ( 1.1 ) .",
    "we recall here these findings , in a language that is somewhat different from the one used in these earlier publications , but that will be similar to the one relevant to the purpose of this paper .",
    "let us divide the universe in cells of given scale , or volume @xmath7 .",
    "the counts in cells , @xmath53 , that is the probability of finding a given amount of matter in a randomly chosen cell , can be obtained ( white 1979 , bas89 ) from a generating function that depends only on the averages , @xmath54 this implies that the counts are defined by the knowledge of a set of numbers @xmath10 , @xmath55 ( to which we add @xmath56 for convenience ) , @xmath57 which are independent of cell size and of time , provided ( 2.1 ) holds .",
    "the counts in cells are then given by ( bas89 ) , @xmath58 where @xmath59 reads , @xmath60 we assume in this paper the coefficients @xmath10 are given .",
    "within the minimal tree - hierarchical model ( 2.5 ) , each of the coefficients @xmath10 is related to the @xmath29 first coefficients @xmath47 ( appendix [ aappend ] ) . as a result @xmath61",
    "can then be calculated from @xmath62 , ... @xmath63 from @xmath10 . in case of the minimal tree - hierarchical model ,",
    "the matter correlation functions are thus entirely determined by the values of the coefficient @xmath10 , and thus by the shape of the mass distribution . for the general tree hierarchical models ,",
    "however , the count - in - cells are seen ( a.19 ) to depend on a suitably defined average over the scale - dependent vertices @xmath47 @xmath64 so , in case only the count - in - cells are considered , the tree hierarchical model and the minimal tree hierarchical model lead to similar , and in practice , indistinguishable results .",
    "however , a priori , the underlying correlations of the general tree hierarchical models might be quite different and more information than the count - in - cells is needed to determine all other probabilities . nevertheless , for the count - in - cells",
    ", both models can be described in terms of constant coefficients @xmath47 .",
    "the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath47 can be explicited through the generating function of the vertices @xmath47 , @xmath65 from which @xmath59 is easily obtained ( bes92 ) by summing ( see , jannink & des cloiseaux 1987 ) the so - called `` tree - graph series '' : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is given as a function of @xmath68 by the equation , @xmath69 the knowledge of the function @xmath59 or @xmath70 determines the multiplicity of cells as a function of their matter content .",
    "a useful relation , that is readily derived from ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ) , is @xmath71      the general properties of the cell distribution @xmath72 , gaussian or non - gaussian regime , behavior for small or large masses in the nonlinear regime can be established , provided @xmath73 ( and hence @xmath74 ) satisfies some very general constraints ( bas89 ) .",
    "these properties , called `` model independent '' , concern any hierarchical model ( and not only the tree models considered here ) .",
    "first , @xmath59 should be a power - law at large @xmath68 , or @xmath67 respectively : @xmath75 this implies for @xmath70 , at large @xmath67    @xmath76    secondly , the series ( 2.10 ) must have a very small radius of convergence , equal to @xmath77 .",
    "this may be due to a rapid divergence of @xmath70 but more likely because of a singularity brought by the implicit equation ( 2.13 ) at @xmath78 , which must thus be quite close to the origin .",
    "this calls also for a small value of the associated value @xmath79 .",
    "the latter situation is the one encountered in the quasi - gaussian regime ( bernardeau 1992 ) .",
    "finally , the choice ( 2.9 ) for defining @xmath16 and @xmath80 implies , for small @xmath68 and @xmath67 , that the following expansions are valid , @xmath81 @xmath82    for the dense cells , the multiplicity function in the non - linear regime , @xmath83 , takes the scaling form ( bas89 ) , @xmath84 that can be written , @xmath85 provided @xmath86 the latter constraint ensures that the matter content of the cells is large enough .",
    "we will refer to these cells as `` halos '' .",
    "the function @xmath87 shows that the dependences on size , density and mass only enter through the ratio @xmath88 ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ 1.1 ] ] and [ [ 2.9 ] ] ) .",
    "it is related to @xmath59 by @xmath89 it is defined only for @xmath16 strictly positive and behaves as @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 with , generically , for tree - hierarchical models @xmath93 .",
    "the mass multiplicity function thus indeed is quite similar to the usual schechter ( 1976 ) parameterization ( exponential times power - law ) of the galaxy and cluster luminosity functions .",
    "these predictions have been successfully checked against direct galaxy counts ( alimi et al .",
    "1990 , maurogordato et al .",
    "1992 , benoist et al .",
    "numerical simulations also stongly back this description of the scaling properties induced by hierarchical clustering ( bouchet et al . 1991 , colombi et al . 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "some departures from the scaling law however were found by colombi et al .",
    "1996 , whereas munshi et al .",
    "1998a find consistency with the numerical data , see discussion of this point by valageas et al .",
    "1999 .    a quite convenient form of @xmath70 , that bears all the desired feature , asymptotic form at small @xmath16 and exponential with large @xmath94 , is ( bes92 ) @xmath95 which leads to @xmath96 the choice of @xmath97 insures a good agreement with the counts in cell statistics obtained in cdm numerical simulations ( bouchet et al .",

    "1996 , munshi et al .",
    "1998b , valageas et al .",

    "these forms are very close to the form proposed by bernardeau ( 1992 ) derived from the equations of the dynamics in the quasi - linear approximation .",
    "the latter finds ( 2.20 ) with @xmath101 is relevant already in the early non - linear regime ( when smoothing effects are neglected that is for @xmath102 ) .",
    "the normalization properties for @xmath87 are worth being recalled .",
    "indeed we have , @xmath103 reminiscent of , @xmath104 both relations are exact sum rules , showing that whenever @xmath72 in the previous integral is replaced by its approximate form , ( 2.16 ) , which is valid for the distribution of dense cells , there is no error in computing the total mass , which is thus shown to essentially be contained in these denser cells .",
    "the normalization property , @xmath105 which means the cells occupy all the volume on the universe , however has no simple analogue for @xmath87 .",
    "indeed we have , @xmath106 that implies that the volume fraction occupied by the dense cells described by @xmath87 is , @xmath107 which is small as compared to unity .",
    "this shows , indeed , that @xmath87 describes the denser cells , that contain all the matter but , occupying a negligible fraction of the volume , may be expected to be surrounded by regions with a negligible fraction of the matter .",
    "this justifies the referrence to these cells as `` halos ''",
    ". it will be the correlations of these dense cells that we aim to calculate in the following .",
    "clearly , would we use the full expression ( 2.9 ) for the probability , which holds in all cases , even for the nearly empty regions with @xmath108 , and include the latter in the sum , the normalization would of course be unity , eq .",
    "( 2.22.1 ) .    for completeness , we recall also that the normalization of @xmath80 ( eq . [ 2.9 ] ) that is used to define @xmath16 has been chosen so as to yield @xmath109 and more generally we have , @xmath110    important constraints can be obtained from the sum rule ( 2.22.4.1 ) .",
    "indeed , writing that , @xmath111 that is @xmath112 whatever @xmath113 . for the value @xmath114",
    "that minimises the above expression , we get the constraint , @xmath115 the same constraints hold if the counts are discrete , still in the limit where @xmath14 is large .",
    "one simply has to use the exact expression ( a.2 ) of @xmath116 for the probability and the weight @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 so as to take advantage of the properties ( bas89 ) of the factorial moments .",
    "such constraints were first derived in a slightly different form by peebles ( 1980 ) for @xmath62 and fry ( 1986 ) for all the terms .",

    "the fact that indeed the observations confirm the existence of such property is an indication of the validity of the hierarchical hypothesis at the matter distribution level .",

    "this is what is indeed observed as stressed by peebles ( 1987 ) , and is by no means in contradiction the existence of a non - trivial natural bias .",
    "however it does not mean that the large scale ( quasilinear , see bernardeau 1996 ) and small scale ( nonlinear , considered here ) biases should be the same .",
    "a short examination of the equation ( 2.27 ) proves that the parameters involved for the values of @xmath172 are completely determined by the nonlinear regime in case of the small - scale bias , whereas they are given by a mixture of the small scale and large scale correlation function behaviors for the bias at large scale . a quantitative ,",
    "if not qualitative , change is expected to occur when one goes from one regime to the other , which may lead to a variation of @xmath197 .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the previous remark on the index @xmath3 since in the former case , we suppose to be only in the strongly nonlinear regime .    the normalization parameters ( the @xmath198 in the equation [ [ 2.39b ] ] ) that are measurable for the galaxy or cluster fields have no reason to be identical to the ones of the matter field .",
    "as a result it would be a complete nonsense to try to discriminate theories with the use , for instance , of the skewness of the matter field obtained in numerical simulation with the one of the galaxy field .",

    "also , the mass weighted statistics of the halo distribution reduces , when all dense halos are included , to the statistics of the matter field , as a generalisation of the properties known ( bes92 , schaeffer 1987 ) for the two - body correlation function .",
    "this is an indication that the halo correlation properties , especially for the higher masses , reflect the selection effects more than the intrinsic properties of the matter field ( this behavior is similar to what is expected in gaussian field , e.g. mo et al . 1997 ) .    in the small mass limit",
    "the behavior of the correlation functions are more dependent on the underlying matter field .",
    "robust results in all regime therefore rely on precise assumptions on the geometrical dependence of the correlation functions .",
    "the simplest assumption is to suppose that the @xmath6-point functions are exact trees in the sense that the vertices are pure numbers .",
    "this corresponds to what we call the minimal tree - hierarchical model . in this case",
    "it is possible to relate the correlation properties of halos , and in particular to the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath172 , to their mass function .",

    "we use this model for illustration purposes , and because in this case no mathematical inconsistencies are encountered .",
    "our results for the bias are consistent with the observed luminosity dependence of the bias ( see discussion in bes92 and in benoist et al 1996 ) although we made no attempt here to determine the luminosity of the halos we have considered .",
    "our results can also be checked against numerical simulations .",

    "they found that the qualitative and quantitative behavior of @xmath417 were in perfect agreement to what we expected for the minimal tree model , which make the mathematical inconsistencies we found all the more puzzling .",
