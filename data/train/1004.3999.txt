    "leptogenesis  @xcite is an extremely successful theory in explaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe by adding three heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath0 to the standard model , @xmath1 with masses @xmath2 at the scale of grand unified theories ( guts ) and yukawa couplings @xmath3 similar to the other fermions .",

    "if the cp asymmetry in the yukawa couplings is large enough , a lepton asymmetry is created by the decays which is then partially converted into a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes . as temperatures are high , interaction rates and the cp asymmetry need to be calculated using thermal field theory  @xcite rather than vacuum quantum field theory .",
