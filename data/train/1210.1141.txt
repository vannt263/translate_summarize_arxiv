    "calculating cross sections for multi - particle ( multi - jet ) production processes can be theoretically challenging when a resummation of multiple interactions is needed , as is the case in large parton density environments such as the small-@xmath2 regime accesible in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the main complication comes from the fact that partons scatter coherently and can not be regarded separately . in particular",
    ", it is very important to appropriately consider the color structure of the multi - particle states since color conservation plays an important role as a source of correlations .",
    "the standard way of calculating such multiple scattering processes is to consider the small-@xmath2 gluons as an external field where high - energy probes scatter in an eikonal way , see ref .  @xcite . under that framework",
    ", each parton traversing the field contributes to the scattering amplitude with a wilson line in the appropriate representation ( fundamental for quarks , adjoint for gluons ) at a fixed transverse coordinate .",
    "provided they are put together in the correct order , the wilson lines account for the color flow of the process under consideration . after averaging ( summing ) over initial ( final ) colors at the cross section level ,",
    "one is left with a product of traces involving wilson lines in the fundamental representation and color matrices which are contracted with adjoint wilson lines .",
    "these adjoint wilson lines can be subsequently replaced by two fundamental wilson lines by means of the identity @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 stands for a wilson line in the adjoint representation at a fixed transverse coordinate , @xmath5 is the corresponding wilson line in the fundamental representation , and @xmath6 are color matrices in the fundamental representation also .",
    "the color matrices can be removed using the fierz identity @xmath7 .",
    "after these manipulations one is left with a sum of products of traces of wilson lines in the fundamental representation only .    in order to calculate measurable observables in this framework , including cross sections for multi - particle production , it is necessary to take a weighted average over the possible external field configurations",
    "this averaging process introduces non - trivial correlations between the fields entering the different wilson lines , therefore giving rise to the afore mentioned coherent scattering involving possibly all the partons appearing in the process .",
    "the physics encoded in this field average is inherently non - perturbative and therefore it is necessary to adopt a suitable model to be able to obtain quantitative results .",
    "nevertheless , some features of the averaging process , such as the rapidity dependence in the low-@xmath2 region , can be appropriately accounted for by perturbative considerations under the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework @xcite .",
    "regardless of the model under consideration for the specific calculation of such field averages , the complexity of the calculation of higher point correlators increases accordingly with the number of wilson lines involved . in the same way ,",
    "the evolution equations derived perturbatively become very cumbersome and not well suited for numerical evaluations .",
    "the first step on an attempt to simplify the treatment of such higher point correlators is to consider the large-@xmath0 limit , in which the average of a product of traces of wilson lines reduces to a product of averages involving only one trace at the time .",
    "in other words , correlations involving fields coming from wilson lines from different traces are suppressed by factors of @xmath0 .",
    "now , in this large-@xmath0 limit it becomes necessary to count appropriately the factors of @xmath0 coming from these multiple scattering terms and keep only the leading terms in such expansion .",
    "once all the color matrices ( fundamental or adjoint ) from vertices contributions have been removed by means of the proper color identities , the power of @xmath0 associated to a given term is just the number of color traces involved .    in principle",
    ", all sorts of correlations involving multiple wilson lines at various transverse coordinates can appear when considering the cross section of a multi - particle production process , but when the large-@xmath0 limit is taken only a few of those contributions are important . taking into account the way that powers of @xmath0 appear from the correlators ,",
    "it is not difficult to realize that the terms with simpler structure are the ones that contribute the most . for a given process",
    ", the number and identity ( quark or gluon ) of the particles in the final state determines the maximum number of wilson lines present in the multiple scattering terms .",
    "the maximum power of @xmath0 present in such terms will correspond to the configuration in which all the wilson lines can be grouped in as many traces as possible , therefore favoring terms with traces of only a few wilson lines .    as a first guess",
    ", one could suggest that this @xmath0 power counting implies that the leading @xmath0 contribution always comes from a term which only includes color dipole amplitudes ( traces of two wilson lines ) and therefore has a maximal number of color traces .",
    "this guess has been proven wrong since thorough studies of two - particle production processes @xcite have shown that some processes do not admit a description in terms of only color dipoles , but that in addition color quadrupoles ( traces of four wilson lines ) are involved as well in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "this quadrupole amplitude can not in general be written in terms of dipole amplitudes only and its small-@xmath2 evolution is determined by an independent equation as shown in @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that there is a direct relation between this quadrupole amplitude and the so - called weiszcker - williams unintegrated gluon distribution function @xcite .",
    "more complicated correlators naturally arise in the calculation of cross sections of processes with more particles in the final state , but they are suppressed by powers of @xmath0 as compared with terms with only dipole and quadrupole amplitudes .",
    "they are nevertheless independent from the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes and in principle should be evaluated on their own .",
    "a procedure to evaluate higher point correlators , in a gaussian model in the large-@xmath0 limit , is described in the appendix and the explicit example of a correlator of six wilson lines is evaluated explicitly .",
    "the small-@xmath2 evolution of such correlators was recently studied analytically in @xcite and numerically in @xcite , the evaluation shown in the appendix provides a suitable initial condition for such equations .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that , in the large-@xmath0 limit , all multi - particle production processes considered under this framework can be described in terms of only dipoles and quadrupoles .",
    "we first work out explicitly examples with three particles in the final state before proceeding to prove the general statement by induction in the number of particles in the final state .",
    "the inductive step is greatly simplified by the observation that it is not necessary to consider all the diagrams contributing to a given process but to find at least one diagram with a term given only by dipoles and quadrupoles which dominates in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "for definiteness sake , let us be more specific about the scenario which we are explicitly considering .",
    "we are interested in processes where multi - particle production takes place in the presence of a ( strong ) background field where a highly energetic initial parton ( photon , quark or gluon ) undergoes multiple scatterings .",
    "this scenario is particularly well suited for nuclear deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments and forward particle production in proton - nucleus collisions ( using collinear factorization for the proton ) where the high density effects of the target are encoded in the background field . for this particular case",
    "the situation simplifies even more since the coherence times of the produced particles are long compared with the length of the target nucleus and therefore the multiple interaction with the dense system can be considered as instantaneous .",
    "the process is then regarded as an incoming high energy parton which splits several times into a given final multi - particle state , interacting at given time with the target which induces a color rotation in the whole multi - particle system ( see fig .",
    "[ splitplusscat ] ) . of course",
    ", one has to consider the scattering with the target happening at all possible stages of the splitting process and sum all these contributions , but for the counting of powers of @xmath0 , which is of our interest , this does not make a difference .",
    "the @xmath0 power counting can only be done at the level of the cross section after one has already averaged ( summed ) over initial ( final ) colors .",
    "nevertheless , one can make some general observations at the level of the amplitude based on color conservation . for a fixed process , with a specific parton in the initial state and a definite particle content in the final state , it is possible to determine what is the maximum number of color traces one can have in the description of the process in the leading order .",
    "take a diagram for such a process at tree level in the large-@xmath0 limit replacing all gluon lines with double quark - antiquark lines which make the color flow explicit , as in fig .",
    "[ splitlargen ] . as a consequence of color conservation",
    "each of the external fermion lines must be connected to another and , since we are considering only tree level diagrams for the moment , there are no closed loops . from this observation",
    "we can see immediately that the maximal number of color traces at tree level is given by the total number of external fermion lines divided by two ( with each external gluon contributing two fermion lines ) .",
    "furthermore , one can see that this maximal number of traces is realized when one considers the square of a given diagram , while interference terms involving different diagrams on the amplitude and conjugate amplitude can possibly have less color traces .",
    "it is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ splitlargen ] that each fermion line appears at most twice at the moment of the multiple scattering , regardless of the exact position of the scattering with respect to the splittings . as a consequence , at most two fundamental wilson lines",
    "are color connected at the amplitude level and therefore , when considering the amplitude squared , the respective color traces in the cross section would have only two wilson lines ( dipoles ) or four wilson lines ( quadrupoles ) . the same will be true for any term with the maximal number of traces .",
    "diagrams like those in fig .",
    "[ splitdiag ] are useful for visualizing the branching of the initial parton into the multi - particle final state but do not contain all the information needed to resolve the color structure of the different contributions to the cross section . for that purpose",
    "it is necessary to consider diagrams including the amplitude and the conjugate amplitude where one can perform the necessary color sums and averages . as an example , let us consider the simple process of a quark splitting into a quark and a gluon which then scatters with a background field .",
    "putting the amplitude and the conjugate amplitude in the same diagram we obtain fig .",
    "[ amcon ] where the dotted lines represent the moment of the scattering in both the amplitude and conjugate amplitude and the dashed line in the middle represents the final state at @xmath8 .",
    "since the approach employed here makes explicit use of the eikonal approximation to account for the multiple scattering with the external field , it is necessary to consider these diagrams in a coordinate representation where each particle has a definite transverse coordinate .",
    "all particles in the final state which are to be detected , and therefore would have a fixed transverse momentum , have different transverse coordinates on each side of the cut at @xmath8 . when considered in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    ", one can see in fig .",
    "[ amconln ] how some of the fermion lines close into loops , which will contribute one color trace to the cross section , while other lines remain open due to the fact that they contain particles in the initial state .",
    "these particles in the initial state should be color connected on both sides of the diagram since one averages over initial colors at the level of the cross section but such connection is not explicit in this kind of diagram .",
    ".,width=604 ]        if one is interested in the color structure only , then it is more convenient to draw one fermion loop for each color trace and gluon lines for each adjoint index contraction ( including adjoint wilson lines too ) .",
    "this can be achieved easily by folding on itself the corresponding diagram with the amplitude and conjugate amplitude in such a way that the color connections of the initial state are made explicit .",
    "also , in order to be able to visualize in the diagram which are the wilson lines entering the expression of the cross section , we will stretch the lines involved in the scattering ( both in the amplitude and conjugate amplitude ) in the horizontal direction and use the other lines only to illustrate the color connections .",
    "for example , the diagram corresponding to fig .",
    "[ amcon ] is shown in the left hand side of fig .",
    "one can go one step further and replace all the gluon lines by double fermion lines using the corresponding color identity , which has the graphical representation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fi ] , in which case the example above takes the form shown in the right hand side of fig .",
    "let us focus on the first term , which is the one surviving in the large-@xmath0 limit , where one can identify right away two pieces which are color disconnected , each contributing a color trace to the cross section .",
    "one involves two wilson lines , and therefore is a dipole , while the other involves four , and therefore is a quadrupole .",
    "the example above shows how this graphic approach allows us to recognize easily which kinds of correlators come in the expression for the cross section of a given process .",
    "one can also recognize that the combination of wilson lines describing such multiple scattering is given by @xmath9w^{ac}_1w^{\\dagger cb}_2=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}\\left[u_1u^\\dagger_2u_3u^\\dagger_4\\right]\\text{tr}\\left[u^\\dagger_1u_2\\right]-\\frac{1}{2n_c}\\text{tr}\\left[u_3u^\\dagger_4\\right],\\ ] ] where fierz identities were used to reach the right hand side .",
    "for more complicated processes the color algebra can be very cumbersome and we will rely heavily in the graphic approach to be able to identify the leading @xmath0 piece of the diagrams involved .",
    "in particular it will be crucial to identify the pieces corresponding to dipoles and quadrupoles which we show separately on fig .",
    "[ dq ] .",
    "it was also mentioned earlier that one should sum over all the possibilities for the multiple interaction to take place in the amplitude and the conjugate amplitude .",
    "consider the process in the example above but with the multiple interaction occurring in the conjugate amplitude before the splitting .",
    "[ qqgint ] illustrates how the different diagrams explained above look for this variation of the same process . for this particular case",
    "it is clear that the contribution to the cross section can be written in terms of two dipoles .",
    "this example illustrates a very important fact that will allow us to concentrate on a smaller number of diagrams : changing the position of the multiple scattering might change the number of wilson lines appearing in the corresponding term in the cross section but it does not change the number of color traces .",
    "it might happen that for some particular cases a color trace is left with no wilson lines inside , giving a trivial factor of @xmath0 , but what is important is that the counting of powers of @xmath0 is the same for a given process regardless of the position of the multiple scattering with respect to the splittings .",
    "the last consideration to be done before starting with the detailed explanation of particular cases is the effect of integrating out particles in the final state . in order to consider inclusive processes",
    "it is sometimes necessary to integrate over the momenta of outgoing particles that are not explicitly measured .",
    "this happens at the leading order for processes in which one produces an additional fermion in the final state without its corresponding antiparticle , as for example in single inclusive deep inelastic scattering where the incoming photon splits into a quark - antiquark pair but only one of them is measured in the final state . for all other processes this effect comes in at next to leading order and will be fundamental if we want our proof to be complete to all orders .",
    "under the eikonal approximation at work in this formalism , the multiple scattering terms take the form of simple wilson lines in the appropriate representation only when considering the process in transverse coordinate space .",
    "the momenta of the particles of the final state enters then through a fourier transform of the respective coordinate in the amplitude and conjugate amplitude . therefore integrating over the transverse momentum of a particle in the final state gives a delta function which identifies the transverse coordinate of the particle in the amplitude with the one in the conjugate amplitude .",
    "given the unitarity of the wilson lines , this sort of manipulation will likely reduce the number of wilson lines appearing in the corresponding contribution to the cross section of any particular diagram . the sum over color indices in the final state guaranties that if a final state particle participates in the multiple scattering both in the amplitude and the conjugate amplitude , both wilson lines appear next to each other in the contribution to the cross section , and if they are placed at the same transverse coordinate then they exactly cancel out .",
    "this sort of cancellation between real and virtual contributions for final state interactions has been studied before and it is well known to be an immediate consequence of unitarity @xcite , the only place where interactions with the unmeasured particle come in is in the interference terms between initial and final state interactions .    from the point of view of the correlators we are interested in ,",
    "it is clear that the ones entering the cross sections of these more inclusive processes are either the same or simpler than the ones involved in the expression for the full exclusive process where all particles in the final state are detected .",
    "this observation allows us to focus our attention to the fully exclusive processes only .",
    "since our goal is to prove by induction an statement that will be valid for all multi - particle production processes in the previously described setup , it is necessary to start our analysis with the simplest cases available .",
    "all of these cases have been previously studied in the literature , here we comment in the results and emphasize the features of the derivations which will be useful for the development of the argument for general cases .",
    "we start with processes with one particle in the final state even though their color structure is better understood in the context of processes with two particles in the final state .",
    "the reason for this is that the non - trivial contributions to these processes are obtained after integrating out one of the particles in the final state .",
    "as explained in the previous section , this yields procedure gives way to simpler expressions where the correlators appearing in the cross section have less wilson lines than the corresponding correlators for the processes with two final state particles .",
    "the choice to present first the one - particle processes follows the thread of the main idea where we intend to organize the processes in terms of the number of particles in the final state , from there on the emphasis will be put on fully exclusive processes with less exclusive processes already accounted for by the observations of the previous section .",
    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) has been widely studied in the literature since it has been recognized to give access to transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions . in the context of saturation physics ,",
    "several studies have cemented the foundations of the formalism to treat deep inelastic scattering processes where the focus was mainly on the total cross section and form factors .",
    "most of these studies are based on the dipole model approach @xcite , which shows directly a clear relation between the total cross section and the forward amplitude of a color dipole going through a background color field , but the same conclusions can be found from the setup explained in the previous sections after one integrates out all the particles in the final state . for the particular case of sidis , it was explicitly shown in @xcite that the only correlator needed in the expression of the cross section is the dipole amplitude , and in @xcite a direct connection to the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions was made .",
    "the lowest order calculation of this process is very simple from the point of view of the multiple scattering , as we are interested in here .",
    "it can be shown that for a dis process , in which one considers a virtual photon splitting into a quark - antiquark pair , the multiple scattering term at the amplitude level always appears as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transverse positions of the quark and antiquark respectively .",
    "clearly , the square of this amplitude will have terms with traces of either zero , two , or four wilson lines , but since one integrates over the momentum of one of the particles , two of the wilson lines are at the same transverse coordinate and therefore cancel out in the term with four wilson lines .",
    "we note that , by swapping the initial state photon and the quark ( or antiquark ) in the final state whose momentum is integrated out , the sidis process turns into photon+hadron production in p+a collisions ( whether the photon is measured or not does nt matter because it does not multiply scatter with the gluons of the target )",
    ". therefore the only correlator needed to express of that cross section is also the dipole amplitude .",
    "this process is of particular importance in the context of the study of cold nuclear matter effects .",
    "one of the first measurements to show deviations from the purely additive scheme where a nucleus is considered as an uncorrelated ensemble of nucleons was the @xmath14-spectrum of produced hadrons in a proton(deuteron)-nucleus collision .",
    "several measurements of the nuclear modification factor for inclusive hadron production were performed showing a clear enhancement at mid - rapidities and suppression at forward rapidities @xcite , which can not be understood without coherent scattering involving several participants in the nucleus .    in the framework described in this paper ,",
    "the lowest order contribution to this process is straightforward to calculate as the convolution of a quark distribution for the projectile with a dipole amplitude formed by the wilson lines corresponding to the quark in the amplitude and the conjugate amplitude . at the partonic level",
    "this is simply transverse momentum broadening of a quark going through a nucleus @xcite .",
    "this level of the calculation has been proven to not be enough to describe the available data and therefore it is necessary to consider additional contributions to the cross section coming mainly from gluon emissions , with the additional complication of having more particles in the final state . as a first attempt ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that one can easily calculate the soft gluon limit where the longitudinal momentum of the gluon is much smaller than that of the original quark and , therefore , the parent quark does not feel any recoil effect after the emission . this no - recoil condition is present in the transverse coordinate space formalism in the form of the parent quark having the same transverse coordinate before and after the emission of the gluon , allowing an easy way to rewrite the interference terms between scattering before and after the splitting in a convenient way in terms of only gluon dipoles @xcite .",
    "the details of how this manipulation works out in the wilson line language will be postponed to the section on di - jet production .",
    "the soft gluon approximation implies a large rapidity gap between the measured hadron and the remnants of the proton in the forward region . in order to extend the region where the calculation is applicable , and",
    "in particular include hadrons in the forward region where the effects of saturation are expected to be stronger , it is necessary to consider the full vertex and allow the parent quark to have different transverse positions before and after the emission .",
    "this was first done in @xcite where the emission vertex is treated exactly but only the divergent pieces are kept after integrating over the momentum of one of the final state particles .",
    "these divergent pieces are shown to be absorbed by the parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions attached to the initial and final state partons by considering the fully dglap evolved distributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an additional contribution to the cross - section , formally of next - to - leading order but nevertheless important to restore the correct high@xmath15 limit , was calculated .",
    "the complete nlo calculation , including the calculation of all virtual terms and also the finite terms after integration over one of the outgoing momenta , was recently done in @xcite . in all cases",
    "it can be seen that , in the large-@xmath0 limit , only dipole amplitudes are needed in the full expression for the cross section . in terms of the small-@xmath2 evolution at nlo , the same conclusion also holds @xcite . in additional",
    ", it has been demonstrated in ref .  @xcite that the dipole formalism employed in this calculation holds at next - to - leading order accuracy .    as a matter of fact",
    ", one can use induction to prove that , for any single inclusive processes in terms of any order in @xmath1 , the scattering amplitudes only contain dipole amplitudes in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "as discussed earlier , the above conclusion holds up to lo and nlo for @xmath13 collisions . to obtain the contribution at nnlo , one just needs to add one more gluon with one single coordinate among the dipoles at the previous order ( nlo ) . using the fierz identity",
    ", one can easily prove that all the relevant graphs can be reduced to products of dipole amplitudes at nnlo in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the proof for single inclusive dis productions is identical .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that all single inclusive processes can be universally described by the dipole amplitudes at the large @xmath0 limit . from the universality point of view",
    ", the large @xmath0 limit plays an important and indispensable role for the factorization proof .",
    "as shown in refs  @xcite , higher point functions , which are new objects , contribute to the cross sections as large @xmath0 corrections . without the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "there is no universality , hence no factorization for single inclusive processes .",
    "the process of di - jet production in dis is of particular interest to us since it is the simplest process where the quadrupole is needed for an accurate description of the multiple scattering factors entering the expression for the cross section .",
    "it was carefully studied in @xcite where it was also emphasized its direct relation to the weizscker - williams gluon distribution function .",
    "it was already mentioned in section [ sidis ] and previously in @xcite that , to leading order at the amplitude level , the corresponding multiple scattering factor for a process including a photon splitting into a quark - antiquark pair is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transverse positions of the quark and antiquark respectively . since for the di - jet process one is interested in keeping explicit the momentum variables for both particles , the transverse coordinates in the amplitude and conjugate amplitude are different and therefore there is a term with four wilson lines in the expression for the cross section .",
    "this quadrupole term takes the form @xmath16\\right\\rangle$ ] and clearly corresponds to the contribution from the diagram where the interaction with the background field occurs after the splitting both in the amplitude and conjugate amplitude .",
    "[ dijetdisfigs ] shows the two ways of graphically representing this process as indicated in section [ gencons ] .",
    "processes with two particles in the final state of a proton - nucleus collision have become increasingly important in the last few years given the availability of new data and the unique character of the physics that can be probed through these particular sort of measurement . by constraining the kinematics of the two outgoing particles",
    ", one can , at leading order , separately fix the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the incoming partons ( up to the additional fragmentation integrals involved in the case of di - hadron production ) , something that can not be achieved by one - particle measurements .",
    "this advantage makes this kind of process very attractive to try to measure high - density effects characteristic of the small-@xmath2 part of the target wave function , and in fact the rhic measurement of di - hadron correlations in the forward region @xcite is considered as the strongest evidence to date of saturation .",
    "several studies concerning this kind of process are available in the literature , those include the role of quark distributions @xcite , general descriptions on how to calculate the cross sections in the presence of background fields @xcite , more phenomenological applications including small-@xmath2 evolution which make direct contact with data @xcite , and factorization studies where a direct relationship is established between these observables and unintegrated gluon distributions @xcite",
    ". here we will just present a summary of the correlators appearing in the cross section for each of these processes and the specific form they take in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the first case to be considered is the quark initiated process where a quark from the projectile splits into a quark and a gluon which are both detected in the final state .",
    "this is precisely the process chosen in section [ gencons ] as illustration of the sort of analysis to be performed throughout this paper .",
    "there it was shown how all the terms entering the cross section for that process at leading order in the large-@xmath0 limit involve only the dipole and quadrupole correlators .",
    "now we turn our attention to processes with gluons in the initial state .",
    "the first one to be considered is the case where an initial gluon from the projectile splits into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the color algebra for this process in the large-@xmath0 limit is particularly simple since the cross section can be written in terms of only dipole correlators , nevertheless , it is important to look closely at some of the aspects of this process since it will allow us to draw general conclusions about any process with quark - antiquark pairs in the final state .",
    "the key aspect here is that the splitting does not introduce any additional color flow in the large-@xmath0 limit , in the double line notation introduced for the large-@xmath0 limit the only effect of such vertex is to separate the two lines and allow for different transverse coordinates for the quark and the antiquark .",
    "such separation has no consequences in the trace structure of the leading part of the diagram when written entirely in terms of fundamental wilson lines .",

    "for definiteness , consider first the case where the scattering occurs after the splitting both in the amplitude and in the conjugate amplitude .",
    "the partons involved in the scattering are therefore two quark - antiquark pairs as indicated on the left hand side of fig .",

[ qgqint ] .",
    "as previously anticipated , the message to take from here is that the color flow structure present in this process is the same for both cases presented above for the leading part in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "moreover , this is the same structure we see when only two gluons are present in the multiple scattering , always the product of two fundamental dipoles .",
    "as opposed to processes where gluons are emitted , no extra color charge is created at the vertex and therefore the color structure remains unchanged , the same is also true for processes with a quark - antiquark pair merging into a gluon which might be important for higher order contributions .    the observations above allows us to neglect , from the point of view of the color structure of the process in the large-@xmath0 limit , all the vertices involving a gluon splitting into a quark - antiquark pair and focus our attention in processes where all the vertices involve a quark emitting a gluon or a gluon splitting into two gluons .",
    "the four - gluon vertex can also be ignored since its color structure is equivalent to a combination of three - gluon vertices .    up until now , the large-@xmath0 limit has been mainly invoked to be able to regard color traces as separate entities , even after one takes the average over the background color field , arguing that correlations between fields entering wilson lines in different color traces are suppressed by factors of @xmath21 .",
    "the multiple scattering factors of the processes considered so far , when expressed in terms of fundamental wilson lines only , can all be expressed in terms of products of traces of either two or four wilson lines in the fundamental representation",
    ". this will not be the case from now on when we start to consider more complicated processes , starting with the case of an initial gluon splitting into two gluons which fragment independently .",
    "this process will have contributions from diagrams with three and four gluons present at the moment of the multiple scattering which will lead to traces of six and eight fundamental wilson lines .",
    "let us consider first the case where the multiple scattering occurs after the splitting in the amplitude and before the splitting in the conjugate amplitude .",

    "this way of taking the large-@xmath0 limit at the matrix level can be generalized to more complicated correlators with similar results .",
    "one can find an ordering of the singlet states such that all the necessary information to find the large-@xmath0 version of the correlator is in a lower diagonal matrix organized in blocks in which going away from the diagonal lowers the power of @xmath0 of the corresponding matrix element .",

    "for such a system of three quarks and three antiquarks there are 6 singlet states available corresponding to the 6 ways of pairing quarks with antiquarks .",

    "only transitions to states corresponding to a higher power of @xmath0 are allowed , which , thanks to the specific order chosen for the singlet states , means that one can divide the corresponding transition matrix into blocks and all the blocks above the diagonal can be neglected .",
    "the corresponding transition matrix @xmath43 takes then the following form @xmath57 where the matrices along the diagonal are diagonal , and the off - diagonal matrices have one power of @xmath0 less than the ones along the diagonal .",

    "<S> by studying the color structure of multi - particle production processes in p+a - type ( dilute - dense ) collisions , we find that higher - point functions beyond typical dipoles and quadrupoles , e.g. , sextupoles , octupoles , etc . , naturally appear in the cross sections , but are explicitly suppressed in the large-@xmath0 limit . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the sextupole in the mclerran - venugopalan model and find that , in general , its analytical form can not be written as combination of dipoles and quadrupoles . within the color glass condensate framework , we present a proof that in the large-@xmath0 limit , all multi - particle production processes in the collision of a dilute system off a dense can , up to all orders in @xmath1 , be described in terms of only dipoles and quadrupoles . </S>"
