    "interstellar carbon is an important contributor to interstellar molecular chemistry and cloud cooling , and is thought to be a major component of interstellar dust ( duley & williams 1981 ; draine 1989 ; joblin , lger & martin 1992 ) .",
    "unfortunately , reliable measurements of the gas - phase interstellar carbon abundance have been elusive because the available absorption features from the dominant ionization stage , c@xmath2 , are either so strong as to be hopelessly saturated ( @xmath01334 ) or so weak as to be undetectable ( @xmath02325 ) . in recent years , however , this situation has changed and high precision measurements of the @xmath02325 line with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have yielded 6 reliable ( @xmath7 2@xmath1 ) measurements of the gas - phase interstellar carbon abundance in diffuse clouds ( cardelli et al .",
    "1993 ; cardelli et al . 1996 ; sofia et al .",
    "1997 ) , one upper limit in diffuse clouds ( cardelli et al . 1996 ) , and 2 upper limits in translucent clouds ( snow et al . 1996 ; 1998 ) .",
    "absorption line measurements suggest that in diffuse interstellar clouds , there is little exchange of carbon between the gas and dust phases ( cardelli et al . 1996 ; sofia et al .",
    "1997 ) , i.e. , a relatively constant c depletion level is observed .",
    "one might expect , however , that a denser cloud region , such as a translucent cloud , may provide a more protective environment than diffuse clouds , and therefore show different depletion characteristics .",
    "a recently reported upper limit for gas - phase carbon in a translucent cloud ( toward hd 24534 ) suggested that this was indeed the case , and that c was substantially more depleted in this region as compared to the more diffuse clouds ( snow et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "since carbon plays such an important role in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and its abundance is such a difficult quantity to measure , we decided to reexamine the spectrum through the translucent cloud toward hd 24534 . in ",
    "2 we will discuss our data calibration and reductions and in  3 our results will be discussed .",
    "the observations of the @xmath02325 line towards hd 24534 are described in snow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in summary ,",
    "the data consist of 40 individual , high resolution ghrs spectra taken with the observing strategy fp - split=4 .",
    "this means that 10 spectra were taken at each of 4 slightly different positions on the photocathode in order to reduce the effects of fixed pattern noise ( fpn ) on the final spectrum .",
    "we obtained these data from the hubble space telescope data archive and they were processed independently by two of us ( ujs and elf ) . in both cases the ghrs - team software package , calhrs , was used to calibrate the spectra ( space telescope pipeline calibrations do not differ significantly from calhrs ) .",
    "in addition , sophisticated flat fielding algorithms were employed to further reduce the effects of fpn , beyond the reduction afforded by the fp - split oberving strategy .",
    "these algorithms are described in spitzer & fitzpatrick ( 1993 ) , cardelli & ebbets ( 1994 ) and cardelli ( 1995 ) .",
    "once the fpn was removed , the data were coadded using the nominal wavelengths determined from the ghrs carousel grating position to align the individual spectra .",
    "we examined the 40 individual spectra and found no reason to exclude any from the final coadded spectrum .",
    "the two independently processed final spectra are essentially identical and have s / n values of approximately 170 near 2325 .",
    "figure 1 shows one of the final spectra ; count rate versus heliocentric wavelength are plotted for a 3segment centered near the expected location of @xmath02325.403 .",
    "the upper and lower spectra show the results with and without , respectively , the application of the additional fpn correction algorithms .",
    "the magnitude of the fpn features is small in the region of the detector sampled by these data and the improvement with the additional correction is only marginal .",
    "it is important to note , however , the the fpn removal algorithm has not added any spurious features to the data .",
    "figure 1 shows clear evidence for the presence of an absorption feature in the wavelength region expected for @xmath02325.4 . figure 2 provides an expanded view of this region ( for the fpn corrected data ) with normalized flux plotted versus heliocentric velocity ( top spectrum ) .",
    "the normalization was accomplished with a second order polymonial fit to the continuum . for comparison",
    ", we also show the @xmath01355 feature seen toward hd 24534 ( lower spectrum ) .",
    "these data have been velocity - shifted by + 1.0 km / sec which is well within the velocity uncertainty of @xmath83.5 km / sec expected for ghrs calibrated data ( savage , cardelli & sofia 1992 ) .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that the absorption feature seen in the top spectrum is closely aligned in velocity with the line ; we thus firmly identify this feature as due to @xmath02325.4 , in strong contrast to the results of snow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we measure the c@xmath2 column density implied by the feature in two ways , from the equivalent width and from component fitting .",
    "the equivalent width of the feature is found to be w@xmath9  =  0.78 @xmath6 0.22 m(note that this result is more than twice as large as the 0.33 m2@xmath1 upper limit quoted by snow et al .",
    "we adopt the oscillator strength f = 5.80 @xmath10 10@xmath11 for the @xmath02325 transition from cardelli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who combined the values of fang et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and lennon et al .",
    "cardelli et al .",
    "estimate an uncertainty of @xmath88% in this value . assuming the weak - line limit",
    ", w@xmath9 implies n(c@xmath2 ) = 2.8 @xmath12 @xmath4 .",
    "the 1@xmath1 uncertainty includes the effects of statistical error , continuum placement , and scattered light uncertainties added in quadrature , but does not include the oscillator strength uncertainty .",
    "the component fitting technique ( see , e.g. spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ) yields a similar result of n(c@xmath2 ) = 2.6 @xmath13 @xmath4 .",
    "again , the quoted uncertainty does not include the error in the oscillator strength .    following snow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we use the diplas & savage ( 1994 ) neutral h column density ( n ( ) = 5.4 @xmath6 0.8 @xmath14 @xmath4 ) and the mason et al .",
    "( 1976 ) h@xmath15 column density ( n(h@xmath15 ) = 1.10 @xmath6 0.30 @xmath16 @xmath4 ) to get the total column density of neutral hydrogen particles toward hd 24534 n(h ) = 2.74 @xmath6 0.61 @xmath10 10@xmath17 @xmath4 .",
    "taking the n ( ) @xmath18 2 @xmath19 @xmath4 from snow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and the average abundance from our measurements ( n ( ) = 2.7 @xmath6 0.8 @xmath10 10@xmath20 @xmath4 ) , we find the gas - phase carbon - to - hydrogen ratio is 10@xmath5 c / h = 106 @xmath6 38 where the 1@xmath1 value takes into account the uncertainties in both the h and ( but not ) column densities .",
    "the gas - phase interstellar carbon - to - hydrogen ratio in the translucent cloud toward hd 24534 is slightly lower than , although within the 1@xmath1 error of , the average ratio seen in the diffuse clouds previously measured ( 10@xmath5 c / h = 142 @xmath6 13 ; sofia et al .",
    "if we add the hd 24534 sightline to the sofia et al .",
    "sample , the average ratio becomes 10@xmath5 c / h = 139 @xmath6 12 .",
    "figure 3 shows the interstellar gas - phase c / h versus the fraction of molecular hydrogen , f(h@xmath15 ) = 2n(h@xmath15)/[2n(h@xmath15 ) + n ( ) ] , for all of the measured diffuse cloud sightlines , as well as the translucent cloud toward hd24534 .",
    "this figure is an update to the snow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) figure 3 , except that we have only included the sightlines with detections .",
    "the data points and error bars in figure 3 do not agree precisely with snow et al.s figure 3 for three reasons : 1 ) we used a weighted average of the bohlin , savage & drake ( 1978 ) and the diplas & savage ( 1994 ) n ( ) measurements whenever possible , 2 ) we have used the updated carbon abundance toward @xmath21 per ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) , and 3 ) we have included the uncertainties associated with the h abundances in our error bars .",
    "figure 3 shows a line plotted at the weighted average of the measured gas - phase c / h values ( 10@xmath5 c / h = 139 ) . this is a statistically acceptable fit to the data",
    "we also plot a weighted linear fit to the c / h data in figure 3 ( dotted line ) .",
    "although the higher order term is not statistically justified , we show the linear fit in order to illustrate a possible trend in the data .",
    "given the uncertainties in the measurements , it is not possible to conclude with certainty whether or not carbon is more depleted in the translucent cloud as compared to diffuse clouds .",
    "if carbon is more depleted in the hd 24534 cloud , it is not by the substantial amount suggested by the snow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) non - detection of ( which implied 10@xmath5 c / h @xmath22 44 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that c is not the only volatile element which does not appear to be significantly more depleted in translucent clouds versus diffuse clouds .",
