    "the alpha magnetic spectrometer is a general purpose particle physics detector , operating in space since may 2011 .",
    "it will achieve a unique long duration mission , aiming at performing antimatter and dark matter searches , as well as cosmic ray composition and flux measurements  @xcite .",
    "the experiment is installed onboard the international space station ( iss ) , that follows a low earth orbit at about 400 km altitude with respect to the earth surface , well located to detect cosmic particles before they interact with the outer layers of the atmosphere .",
    "this makes the iss one the most interesting environments to perform cosmic rays studies .",
    "the measurements presented in this document are based on the data collected during the first 30 months of operations of the detector , from may 19th 2011 to november 26th 2013 . in this period 41@xmath0",
    "cosmic ray events were detected .",
    "the detector is composed of several sub - detectors , as shown in figure  [ vecchi : fig1 ] .        the silicon tracker  @xcite measures the trajectory and absolute charge @xmath1 of cosmic rays by performing multiple measurements of the coordinates and energy loss . together with the 0.14  t permanent magnet ,",
    "the tracker measures the particle rigidity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the momentum .",
    "the transition radiation detector ( trd )  @xcite identifies the particle as an electron / positron .",
    "the four layers of the time of flight ( tof )  @xcite measure the particles charge and ensure that the particle is downward - going . the high efficiency ( @xmath4 ) anti - coincidence counters  @xcite inside the magnet bore are used to reject particles outside the geometric acceptance .",
    "the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich )  @xcite measures the particles charge and velocity .",
    "the imaging electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal )  @xcite identifies the particle as an electron / positron and measures its energy .",
    "+ the ams-02 detector has been extensively calibrated using a test beam at cern with @xmath5 and @xmath6 from 10 to 290 gev , with protons at 180 and 400 gev , and with @xmath7 from 10 to 180 gev .",
    "electrons and positrons only account for a tiny fraction of the cosmic rays : @xmath5 are @xmath8 less abundant than protons , while @xmath6 are @xmath9 less abundant than protons",
    ". however , the measurement of their fluxes can provide important informations to understand the nearby universe , as their detection horizon is limited to few kiloparsecs , due to energy losses .",
    "three main sub - detectors provide clean and redundant identification of positrons and electrons with independent suppression of the proton background .",
    "these are the trd ( above the magnet ) , the ecal ( below the magnet ) and the tracker .",
    "the matching of the ecal energy and the momentum measured with the tracker ( _ e / p _ in the following ) greatly improves the proton rejection . to differentiate between @xmath10 and protons in the trd",
    ", an estimator formed by the ratio of the log - likelihood probability of the @xmath10 hypothesis to that of the proton hypothesis in each layer is used .",
    "the proton rejection power of the trd estimator at 90@xmath11 @xmath10 efficiency is 10@xmath12 to 10@xmath13  @xcite , as estimated using flight data . to cleanly identify electrons and positrons in the ecal ,",
    "a boosted decision tree estimator is built using the 3d shower shape .",
    "the ecal proton rejection power reaches 10@xmath14 when combined with the _ e / p _ matching requirement .",
    "the data collected during the first 30 months of operations of the detector were analysed to provide precise measurements of the positron fraction  @xcite and the individual positron and electron fluxes  @xcite .",
    "the positron flux have been measured up to 500 gev and of the electron flux up to 700 gev .",
    "these results generated widespread interest and discussions on the origin of high - energy positrons and electrons  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "+ in this document , based on the published result  @xcite , we present a dedicated measurement of the combined ( e@xmath17 + e@xmath18 ) up to 1 tev . + the isotropic flux of cosmic rays electrons and positrons in each energy bin @xmath19 , of width @xmath20 , is given by  @xcite : @xmath21[flux ] where @xmath22 is the number of electrons plus positrons with energy between @xmath19 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the effective acceptance , @xmath25 is the exposure time .",
    "the flux is measured in 74 energy bins from 0.5 to 1 tev , and the bin width is chosen to be at least two times the energy resolution .",
    "the bin - to - bin migration error is 1@xmath11 at 1 gev decreasing to 0.2@xmath11 above 10 gev .",
    "the effective acceptance @xmath24 is the product of the detector geometric acceptance ( @xmath26  500 @xmath27sr ) and the selection efficiency , estimated with simulated events and validated with a pure sample of electron events identified in the data .",
    "the exposure time is evaluated as a function of energy and it takes into account the lifetime of the experiment which depends on its orbit location and on the geomagnetic cutoff  @xcite .        to identify downward - going particles of charge one , cuts are applied on the velocity measured by the tof and on the charge reconstructed by the tracker and the trd .",
    "the energy deposited in the ecal is also used to reject events compatible with a minimum ionising particle . to reject positrons and electrons produced by the interaction of primary cosmic rays with the atmosphere , the minimum energy within the bin is required to exceed 1.2 times the geomagnetic cutoff . over a sample of well reconstructed particles with a single track in the tracker passing through the ecal ,",
    "the identification of signal events is performed by first applying a fixed cut in the ecal estimator to further reduce the proton background .",
    "the number of signal and background event is estimated for each energy bin performing a template fit procedure , described in  @xcite . in total ,",
    "10.6 @xmath28 events are identified as electrons and positrons with energies from 0.5 gev to 1 tev .",
    "a major experimental advantage of the combined flux analysis compared to the measurement of the individual positron and electron fluxes , especially at high energies , is that the selection does not depend on the sign of the charge , implying higher selection efficiency .",
    "consequently , this measurement is extended to 1  tev with less overall uncertainty over the entire energy range .",
    "+ the absolute energy scale is verified using minimum ionizing particles and the ratio between the energy , measured by the ecal , and the momentum , measured by the tracker . these results are compared with the test beam values where the energy beam is known to high precision .",
    "between 10 and 290 gev ( test beam energies ) , the uncertainty on the absolute scale is @xmath29 , while below 10 gev it increases to 5 @xmath11 at 0.5 gev and above 290 gev to 5 @xmath11 at 1 tev .",
    "this is treated as an uncertainty on the bin boundaries .",
    "the statistical error dominates above 140 gev , as it is shown in the table 1 in  @xcite .",
    "+ figure  [ ecrs_2016_alle ] shows the ams-02 combined electrons plus positrons flux , rescaled by the cube of the energy , as a function of energy , together with previous measurements .",
    "given the high statistics and high precision of the measurement , the spectral index of the combined flux has also been measured and , for energies higher than 30 gev , it is found to be compatible with a single power law . +",
    "the measurement of the separate fluxes  @xcite shows that electron and positron fluxes are different in magnitude and in their energy dependence . above 20 gev ,",
    "the positron flux is significantly harder than the electron flux , implying that the observed rise in the positron fraction is due to an excess of positrons and not to a loss of electrons .",
    "this indicates that high energy positrons have a different origin from that of electrons . to quantitatively study the energy dependence of the flux in a model independent way , the flux is fit with a spectral index @xmath30 as : @xmath31 over a sliding energy window .",
    "the energy e is expressed in gev and c is the normalisation constant .",
    "the resulting energy dependence of the fitted spectral index is shown in figure  [ gamma ] , where the shading indicates the correlation between the neighbouring points due to sliding energy window .",
    "interestingly , the combined @xmath32 flux can be described by a single power law above 30.2 gev , with @xmath33 .",
    "the flux , measured from 0.5 to 1 tev , is smooth and reveals new and distinct information .",
    "no structures were observed .",
