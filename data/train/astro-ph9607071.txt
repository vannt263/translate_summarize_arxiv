    "@xmath6s , @xmath7s and @xmath4s abundance ratios are not drastically different from those in the solar system . for @xmath0s , no interstellar data have been obtained so far .",
    "@xmath6s , @xmath7s , and @xmath4s are mainly primary products of oxygen burning ( woosley et al .",
    "1973 , chin et al .  1996 ) ; however , especially the @xmath4s yield retains a substantial sensitivity to the metallicity ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath0s is thought to be a purely secondary isotope produced by neutron captures on the primary sulfur seeds during helium and carbon burning ( thielemann & arnett 1985 , langer et al .",
    "this isotope is , hence , formed in a process significally different from that of the other sulfur or cno isotopes accessible by means of molecular spectroscopy at cm- and mm - wavelengths .",
    "we have observed eight galactic hot cores in two rotational lines of c@xmath0s in order to determine the abundance of @xmath0s relative to other sulfur isotopes and to relate this isotopic abundance pattern to that of the local galaxy 4.6gyrs ago , i.e.  the solar system value .",

    "from fig.[fig : c36s - profiles ] it is evident that close to the @xmath2 line frequency of c@xmath0s there is molecular emission from another line toward some of the sources , such as orion , iras15520 , ngc6334b and possibly toward w51(m ) .",
    "the @xmath3 line appears to be less contaminated except toward orion and w51(m ) .",
    "it is known that chemically younger molecular clouds such as orion tend to have a more complex chemistry than older clouds where mainly simple molecules are observed ( helmich et al .",
    "this can explain the diffences in line blending .",
    "close to the c@xmath0s @xmath2 transition there are several @xmath24 lines of the @xmath25 transition of ch@xmath26c@xmath26n ( methyl cyanoacetylene ; lovas 1984 ) .",
    "this symmetric top molecule has been previously detected toward tmc-1 ( broten et al .",
    "1984 ) . assuming that the population of the corresponding levels can be described by a boltzmann law with a kinetic temperature of 90k ( derived from the very similar ch@xmath26cn , cummins et al .  1983 ) and",
    "using the line strengths and level energies from lovas ( 1984 ) , we made a gaussian fit fixing the estimated relative intensities of the ch@xmath26c@xmath26n lines for orion , where line contamination is worst .",
    "the resulting estimate for the intensity of the c@xmath0s @xmath2 line is given in table[tbl : c36s - gauss ] .",
    "the only line in the lovas ( 1984 ) line catalog potentially contaminating the @xmath3 line of c@xmath0s is a transition of ch@xmath27chcn ( vinyl cyanide ; @xmath28 142.527ghz ) displaced by 4.5mhz ( 9.4kms@xmath20 ) from c@xmath0s .",
    "vinyl cyanide is known to be abundant in orion but probably not in massive star forming regions with an `` older '' chemistry .",
    "the frequency separation is sufficiently high for most of the soures investigated to separate it clearly from the c@xmath0s emission .",
    "we have further evidence that our identification of c@xmath0s is indeed correct .",
    "as it is expected for the optical thin case , the @xmath29 line ratios are similar for each of the optically thin species , including c@xmath0s .",
    "also there is no large variation of the line ratios between different isotopomers of a given transition for different sources .",
    "we conclude that our identification of c@xmath0s is justified .",
    "the line parameters are , however , best determined in sources with an `` old '' chemical composition ( i.e.  less complex molecules ) , such as iras16172 , ngc6334a , and iras15520 .",
    "we concentrate here on the @xmath4s/@xmath0s abundance ratio since @xmath30c@xmath6s lines tend to be moderately optically thick in galactic star - forming regions ( e.g.  frerking et al .",
    "1980 , linke & goldsmith 1980 , chin et al .  1996 ) ; @xmath11c@xmath6s would involve a double isotope ratio and c@xmath7s is less easy to interpret due to its hyperfine structure .",
    "there is only a slight galactic gradient in the @xmath6s/@xmath4s abundance ratio from the data of chin ( 1995 ) and chin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "since c@xmath4s and c@xmath0s are most probably both optically thin and since both have very similar molecular constants and were measured with the same telescopes we can assume that the ratio of integrated intensities ( see table [ tbl : c36s - gauss ] ) for a given rotational transition equals the respective abundance ratio . from the data in table[tbl : c36s - gauss ] , we obtain a weighted mean abundance ratio of @xmath4s/@xmath0s=115(@xmath31 ) .",
    "the standard deviation given is the square root of the weighted average variance of the data ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "since we can not exclude , at the present time , that part of the scatter in the data is caused by a galactic gradient or by less systematic variations from source to source , we believe that this reflects the uncertainties better than the standard deviation of the weighted mean .",
    "the unweighted mean is 128(@xmath32 ) .",
    "the interstellar value of @xmath4s/@xmath0s is considerably smaller than the solar system ratio of 200 ( see fig.[fig : c36s - abundances ] ) .",
    "there is no systematic difference between the ratios obtained from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 lines . due to the scatter of our data and the narrow range in galactocentric distances it is premature to discuss a galactic abundance gradient . using @xmath33 and the @xmath30c/@xmath11c relation with galactocentric radius from wilson & rood ( 1994 ) , we obtain as the weighted mean value from our data @xmath6s/@xmath0s=3280@xmath34 .",
    "also for these isotopes , the interstellar ratio is smaller than the solar system value ( 4520 ) .    according to the metallicity dependent yields of @xmath4s in massive stars ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) , this isotope , which is produced during oxygen burning , has a character intermediate to primary and secondary isotopes .",
    "@xmath0s , on the other side , is produced as a purely secondary isotope during s - process nucleosynthesis in massive stars , predominantly in helium and carbon burning ( thielemann & arnett 1985 , langer et al .",
    "1989 ) , with a possible ( also secondary ) contribution from agb stars .",
    "only a small fraction of the produced @xmath0s is destroyed in later burning phases and during the supernova explosion ( s.e .",
    "woosley , priv .",
    "comm . ) . according to the comprehensive massive star models of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , the ratio of the production factors ( i.e.  output vs.  input ) of @xmath4s over @xmath0s in @xmath35 stellar models drops roughly from 10 to 1 when the stellar initial metallicity is increased from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .    a larger solar @xmath4s/@xmath0s ratio than the corresponding present ism value is thus in agreement with stellar @xmath0s yields increasing with time and simultaneously constant @xmath4s yields during galactic evolution , i.e.  a larger ism value 4.6gyr ago compared to today . in fact ,",
    "a similar trend is found in two other isotope ratios which are clearly primary vs.  secondary , namely for @xmath30c/@xmath11c ( @xmath38 : 89 , local ism : 70 ) and @xmath39o/@xmath40o ( @xmath38 : 2700 , local ism : 1900 ; cf .",
    "henkel et al .  1995 ) .",
    "this analogy suggests a positive galactic @xmath4s/@xmath0s gradient , similar to those observed for the mentioned carbon and oxygen isotope ratios .",
    "this can be confirmed or rejected by observations of c@xmath0s and c@xmath4s in sources covering a larger range of galactocentric radii .",
    "for the first time we have detected a molecule containing @xmath0s in space .",
    "c@xmath0s could be measured in two rotational transitions and toward eight molecular hot cores .",
    "the interstellar @xmath4s/@xmath0s abundance ratio of 115 @xmath5 is lower than in the solar system ( 200 ) .",
