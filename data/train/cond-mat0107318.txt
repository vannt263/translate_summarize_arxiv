    "the chalker - coddington network model is perhaps the simplest model believed to be in the universality class of the quantum hall transition@xcite .",

    "the renormalization group ( rg ) fixed point of the disorder averaged effective action is expected to capture the critical properties of the transition .",
    "recently , an all orders @xmath0 function was proposed for the network model@xcite .",
    "the main difficulty encountered in interpreting the resulting rg flows is the occurance of singularities in the @xmath0 function . for the case of anisotropic @xmath8 , by using duality and certain topological identifications it was shown in @xcite that all rg trajectories were regular in the sense that all flows could be extended to arbitrarily large and small length scales without encountering any true singularities .",
    "further checks of the @xmath0 function in the case of anisotropic @xmath8 described in @xcite provided additional support that the @xmath0 function could be analytically continued beyond the domain of convergence of the perturbation series .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to analyze in detail the rg flows of the chalker - coddington network model and also the network model for the spin quantum hall transition@xcite and to attempt to resolve the possible singular flows using the ideas in @xcite .",
    "there are large classes of flows that are regular , and for these we identify two universal attractive directions at large distances , referred to as @xmath9 and @xmath10 below .",
    "( some of the phases listed as distinct in @xcite become identified since we now understand how to cross the singularities . )",
    "the @xmath9 phase is in the same universality class as a disordered @xmath1 model or gade - wegner class@xcite and is equivalent to the model studied in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the flows in the physical domain of the network model with all couplings ( which are variances of disordered potentials ) positive are pathological in the sense that they encounter a true singularity after a finite scale transformation and the flow can not be continued to larger length scales .",
    "these singular flows seem to be related to the fact that there are level @xmath11 current algebras in these theories which arise naturally in the supersymmetric method for disorder averaging .",
    "putting aside the @xmath0 function , we argue that the possible fixed points of general anisotropic left / right current - current interactions should correspond to the solutions of the virasoro master equation@xcite which are built upon the same tensors that define the current interactions and thus preserve the global symmetries .",
    "we classify these solutions for both network models and show that they correspond to current - algebra cosets . since this argument is independent of the @xmath0 function , it remains a possibility that a proper resolution of the singular flows could lead to these fixed points .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that such cosets can arise as fixed points of the rg when the coupling to a current subalgebra flows to infinity and the current subalgebra is gapped out .",
    "some of the regular flows actually realize these fixed points , in particular phase @xmath12 in the unphysical regime of spin network model flows to @xmath13 . by doubling the degrees of freedom as in @xcite",
    ", this may correspond to a physical model of interest . for the spin network model one solution corresponds to the coset @xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the number of copies , and this fixed point gives some of the same exponents as percolation@xcite though the equivalence of the two theories is still a matter of debate .    for the @xmath15 network model",
    "the only zeros of the @xmath0 function correspond to a purely random @xmath15 gauge field .",
    "we point out that the stress tensor of this line of fixed points corresponding to the strength of the disorder does not satisfy the virasoro algebra , which apparently has not been noticed before .",
    "there is a special point on this line that leads to a constant density of states , and can formally be viewed as `` @xmath16 '' as far as the computation of critical exponents is concerned .",
    "( this is not a true coset since the @xmath17 does not commute with the stress tensor , however we find the coset notation convenient and will use it in the sequel .",
    ") this @xmath18 conformal field theory is different from the @xmath19 theory @xmath20 considered in @xcite , nor is it the same as the theories considered in @xcite .",
    "we wish to emphasize that due to the singularities of the rg flow in the physical regime of the network models we can not show that the above cosets genuinely arise as fixed points .",
    "however , based on our analysis of the virasoro master equation , they remain as interesting candidates for the correct fixed point and are worth further investigation , even with the aim of ruling them out . in this paper",
    "we thus also explore the multifractal properties of the above coset theories , and show that these cosets lead to multifractality in a very natural way .",
    "this multifractality is an important constraint on the critical theory and since it is not a generic feature of the kinds of fixed points that can arise , it can serve as a criterion for ruling out some theories . in particular we show that the coset @xmath20 does not exhibit multifractality , whereas @xmath16 does . for the coset @xmath21",
    "we show that the typical amplitude exponent @xmath22 , and the typical point contact conductance exponent is @xmath23 .",
    "since the map to percolation@xcite does not apply to averages of higher moments of correlation functions , this result can serve as a useful test of the validity of the fixed point @xmath3 . for the @xmath17 coset",
    ", it turns out @xmath24 .",
    "however if one associates @xmath4 with the twist fields which modify the boundary conditions then @xmath4 is again @xmath25 and this is close to numerical estimates of @xmath26@xcite .",
    "the small errors in the most recent simulations however seem to rule out @xmath25@xcite .",
    "we also obtain a scaling relation between @xmath4 and the typical point - contact conductance exponent @xmath5 which we expect to hold in a theory with a constant density of states : @xmath27@xcite .",
    "our results are presented as follows . in section",
    "ii we extend the computation in @xcite to @xmath14 copies , and show , as expected , that the @xmath0 functions are independent of @xmath14 .",
    "we present a remarkable strong - weak coupling duality of the @xmath0 function .",
    "we then describe all possible flows , and describe the nature of the singular flows . in section iii",
    "we extend this analysis to the network model for the spin quantum hall transition and find similar properties . in section",
    "iv we present our results on the multifractality .",
    "the subsections on the virasoro master equation and multifractality are logically independent of the sections describing the rg flows and can be read separately .",
    "the chalker - coddington network model@xcite is expected to be in the same universality class as the dirac hamiltonian with random mass , potential and abelian gauge fields@xcite : h = ( ) [ hamilcc ] where @xmath28 are centered gaussian random potentials with variance @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the physical regime of the network model thus corresponds to all @xmath31 positive .",
    "the couplings @xmath32 correspond to randomness in the link phases , the flux per plaquet and the tunneling at the nodes respectively .",

    "to study the delocalization transition one is interested in the critical points of the disorder averaged theory at @xmath43 . since @xmath44 corresponds to various mass terms , the theory can not be critical when @xmath45 .",
    "the function we determine below is for @xmath46 , and for this reason it is independent of whether the various copies are retarded or advanced .",
    "one can in fact convert advanced copies into retarded ones by flipping the sign of the right - moving fields @xmath47 . since this does not change the @xmath48 operator products , the function is unchanged .",
    "once one flows to a critical point , one needs to reintroduce @xmath39 in order for instance to compute conductivities .",
    "this can be compared with the sigma model approach .",
    "the latter approach was applied to the coupling sub - manifold @xmath34 of the network model in @xcite .",
    "an important point is that the saddle point approximation that leads to a sigma model occurs in the @xmath46 theory .",
    "thus one expects that our rg flows should in principle capture these saddle points .    in order to study disorder averages of mixed products of retarded and advanced green functions we introduce @xmath14 copies of the action ( [ 2.1 ] ) , with fields @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a copy , or flavor , index .",
    "the disorder averaging is then performed using the supersymmetric method by introducing ghosts @xmath52 . to present the effective action in a compact form , we introduce the @xmath53 component vectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and we let @xmath56 and similarly for @xmath57 .",

    "the condition that a stress tensor @xmath111 satisfies the virasoro algebra , i.e. [ tope ] t(z ) t(0 ) ~ + t(0 ) + .... , is the so - called virasoro master equation studied extensively in @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , because these physical flows reach the singularity at points distinct from the self - dual point @xmath157 , they can not be extended smoothly beyond this point using duality and possible additional identifications as explained in @xcite .",
