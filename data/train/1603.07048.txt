    "more precisely , `` preserved u(1 ) symmetry '' means that _ both _ the bulk ground state and the many - body hamiltonian are u(1)-symmetric . according to the violation of one of these conditions , we identify two mechanisms of the u(1 ) symmetry breaking , which lead to the loss of topological protection and eventual transitions to the tt phases .    first , u(1 ) could be broken spontaneously : upon increasing @xmath10 , a second - order phase transition from the tnt phase @xmath30 to the phase with spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry may occur .",

    "thus , as expected , if the physical symmetry is broken , there is no topological protection already at the single - particle level ( @xmath360 ) . as a result , in the presence of repulsive interactions ( @xmath399 ) , the system is in a tt phase with broken u(1 ) symmetry and gapped edge excitations for all magnetic fields @xmath400 .",
    "similarly , expanding the term of the second category about the ground state , and keeping only the zeroth - order term in @xmath310 , _ 2 ( ) & = & 12u_2[^2_0(x)+()]2(-_2 ) + & & 12u_2 ^2_0(x ) 2(-_2 ) , and performing the substitution ( [ eq : vphiapprox ] ) , we obtain a contribution -^_2[]=u^_2y 2((y;t)-_2 ) to the 1d lagrangian of the edge excitations , where @xmath401 note that the coefficient @xmath402 appears to be given by the same function @xmath351 [ ] as for the gradient term .",
    "therefore , for preserved physical symmetry ( inversion ) , the edge is described by the lagrangian @xmath396+\\lf^{1d}_{2\\os}[\\phi]$ ] .",
    "this is also a sine - gordon model , but differs from by the numerical factor ( 2 instead of 1 ) in the cosine argument . as a result , the edge ground state breaks u(1 ) symmetry ( the field acquires a finite expectation value @xmath403 ) and the edge excitations become gapped in a different range of interaction strength , namely at @xmath404 . according to , the quantum phase transition at the field @xmath405 [ ] such that @xmath406 occurs at the verge of the qhfm regime , where @xmath407 .",
    "the system has gapless edge excitations for lower fields @xmath408 and gapped excitations for all higher fields @xmath409 .",
    "one of the key questions raised in the studies of topological systems is how interactions affect the topological properties .",
    "a common understanding is that a noninteracting topological insulator is generally not guaranteed to remain such in the presence of interactions .",
    "our present findings allow us to specify the symmetry requirements for the topological protection in the presence of interactions .",
    "we remind that the qhtis we consider are protected by some physical symmetry , see . due to this symmetry , two relevant lls ( )",
    "have different transformation properties and are thus not coupled at the single - particle level . as a result , the projected _ single - particle _ hamiltonian within these two lls possesses @xmath45 symmetry with respect to uniaxial isospin rotations [ ] .    aggregating the results of , we conclude that this _ effective continuous _",
    "@xmath45 symmetry is the one responsible for the topological protection _ in the presence of interactions _ in ( at least ) this class of systems , qhtis .",
    "if u(1 ) symmetry is preserved , the tnt phase with gapless edge charge excitations persists for any effective strength of interactions , even in the qhfm regime of strong interactions , realized in the vicinity of the single - particle topological phase transition .    however , we find that the physical symmetry alone is generally not sufficient to protect the tnt phase in the presence of interactions .",
    "the interactions preserving the physical symmetry can still break @xmath45 symmetry and thereby destroy the tnt phase for strong enough effective interactions .",
    "more precisely , `` preserved u(1 ) symmetry '' means that _ both _",
    "( i ) the bulk ground state and ( ii ) the interacting projected hamiltonian are u(1)-symmetric . accordingly",
    ", the two mechanisms by which u(1 ) symmetry can be broken correspond to violation of one of these conditions :    \\(1 ) first , as demonstrated in , even the @xmath45-symmetric interactions ( condition ( ii ) satisfied ) with the right properties ( `` easy - plane '' anisotropy ) can result in a bulk ground state with spontaneously broken @xmath45 symmetry ( condition ( i ) violated ) : the @xmath188 phase .",
    "as demonstrated in , this phase has gapped edge charge excitations and is thus tt .",
    "\\(2 ) second , as demonstrated in , interactions can ( depending on the physical symmetry ) contain terms that preserve the physical symmetry , but break the effective @xmath45 symmetry ( condition ( ii ) violated ) . as then shown in , these terms result in a phase transition to the tt phase with broken @xmath45 symmetry at the edge and gapped excitation spectrum . at the same time , the u(1)-symmetric bulk ground state @xmath138 may still persists beyond this transition ( condition ( i ) satisfied ) .",
    "we mention that similar types of interactions have earlier been considered  @xcite in the studies of helical luttinger liquids for the edge of 2d topological insulators protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the transitions from the tnt phase to either of these tt phases occur upon increasing the magnetic field @xmath10 , as the single - particle phase transition point @xmath11 is approached and the effective interactions get stronger , but at fields _ lower _ than @xmath11 : at @xmath410 [ ] and @xmath405 [ ] , respectively , as summarized in ( c ) .",
    "thus , these are _ interaction - induced topological quantum phase transitions _ , enabled due to the tunability of the effective interactions by the magnetic field , .",
    "in this work , we studied the effect of electron interactions on the topological properties of _ quantum hall topological insulators_. due to the crossing of landau levels at the single - particle topological phase transition , its vicinity is automatically the regime of strong effective interactions .",
    "an appealing theoretical aspect of such a system is that it can be studied in a controlled way within the framework of quantum hall ferromagnetism .",
    "a particular attention was paid to establishing the requirements for the topological protection in this interacting system .",
    "we find that this question is ultimately related to the effective symmetry of the system : the continuous u(1 ) symmetry is a necessary condition for the topologically nontrivial phase to persist in the regime of strong effective interactions .",
    "if u(1 ) symmetry is preserved , the edge of the topologically nontrivial phase is described by the helical luttinger liquid .",
    "the effective interactions of this luttinger liquid are highly tunable by the magnetic field @xmath10 : they are weak ( for weak bare coulomb interactions ) at small @xmath10 and grow as @xmath10 is increased , becoming strong in the quantum hall ferromagnet regime in the vicinity of the single - particle topological phase transition .",
    "the u(1 ) symmetry may be broken , however , either spontaneously or by the interactions that are explicitly u(1)-asymmetric . in either scenario ,",
    "this eventually results in a phase transition to a topologically trivial phase with gapped edge excitations , which can be achieved by tuning the interaction strength by the magnetic field .",
    "the tunability of interactions , the accessibility of the regime of strong effective interactions even in a system with weak bare interactions , and the possibility to realize interaction - induced topological phase transitions are among the properties that make quantum hall topological insulators an attractive class of systems for investigating the interplay of interactions and topology , both theoretically and experimentally .",
