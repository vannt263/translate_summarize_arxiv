    "the importance of surface diffusion as a mechanism of mass transport has been acknowledged in various fields , such as chromatography , @xcite sintering , @xcite microelectronics , @xcite civil engineering , @xcite heterogeneous catalysis , @xcite or neuroscience .",
    "@xcite a widely used approach to simulate surface diffusion at a microscopic level is to employ lattice - gas models .",
    "@xcite in these models the diffusion is given by a potential relief of the surface .",
    "while most of the time the particles stay at adsorption sites ( minima of the relief ) , occasionally they perform random jumps to adjacent vacant sites .",
    "if the jumps are fast enough , the microstates of the system can be represented by occupation numbers ( one number for each site ) , as in a lattice gas .",
    "interactions between particles may strongly influence surface diffusion .",
    "indeed , attractive interactions between particles adsorbed on the surface restrain their migration and , thus , slow down diffusion . by the same token , repulsion between adsorbed particles",
    "boosts diffusion .",
    "this basic picture is obscured by the fact that particles in the activated state ",
    "those performing jumps between two sites and located at saddle points of the potential relief  also interact with the adsorbed particles within their vicinity , which may have a significant impact on diffusion as well .",
    "however , the effect of this interaction is opposite : if it is attractive , it tends to lower the effective barriers of the jumps , which leads to higher jump probabilities and a boost in diffusion ; if it is repulsive , it should slow diffusion down . using monte carlo simulations at temperatures above the critical point ,",
    "the effect of each of these two types of interactions on diffusion was already studied separately , corroborating the above - described anticipated behavior .",
    "@xcite a combined effect of both types of interaction has not been studied , though .",
    "hence , it still remains unclear which effect is dominant and under what conditions .",
    "this point is investigated in detail in the present paper .    to this end",
    ", we employ a simple lattice - gas model with an attractive nearest - neighbor interaction , @xmath0 , between adsorbed particles , and a different ( attractive or repulsive ) interaction , @xmath1 , between an activated particle and its closest adsorbed particles .",
    "a triangular , square , and hexagonal lattice will be considered , all of which will turn out to exhibit the same type of behavior in surface diffusion coefficients .",
    "our analysis is based on two basic assumptions .",
    "first , we will assume that the surface coverage varies only very slowly with time and space , i.e. , that the local equilibrium approximation is applicable .",
    "then the chemical and jump diffusion coefficients , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , can be expressed via purely thermodynamic quantities . as various comparisons with kinetic simulations",
    "have revealed , the results obtained within this approximation are reliable even farther away from equilibrium , @xcite indicating that the approximation is actually quite robust .",
    "second , we assume that the temperature is low ( sufficiently below the critical point ) so that ordered phases of adsorbed particles occur in the system",
    ". then explicit formulas for coverage dependences of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are available , @xcite and the needed thermodynamic quantities can be evaluated ( to any desired precision , in principle ) via cluster expansions . in particular , one can evaluate various multi - site correlation functions that inevitably arise due to the presence of an activated - state interaction .",
    "@xcite previously , the correlations were obtained only by approximative techniques , like the cluster variation method @xcite or approximations via two- or three - site correlations . @xcite rather crudely , the activated - state interactions were often neglected to work only with the correlations between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xcite    the paper structure is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the studied lattice - gas model and give expressions for the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 in terms of the surface coverage , isothermal susceptibility , and a correlation factor . in section",
    "[ sec : res ] we then investigate the effects of the two interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 on these coefficients , employing general formulas for the coverage dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . upon evaluating the quantities involved in these formulas for our model , we obtain explicit dependences of @xmath6 and @xmath7 on the interactions , allowing us to analyze in detail their influence on surface diffusion . a summary of our results and concluding remarks are given in a final section .",
    "we shall consider an ideal solid surface whose potential relief minima form a triangular , square , or hexagonal lattice .",
    "each lattice site , @xmath8 , is either vacant ( an occupation number @xmath9 ) or occupied by an adparticle ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "an interaction between adparticles is assumed to occur only between nearest neighbors ( _ _ nn__s ) , the corresponding interaction energy being attractive , @xmath11 .",
    "the model hamiltonian is given as @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the number of occupied sites ( occupied _ nn _",
    "pairs ) in a given microstate and @xmath15 is the chemical potential .",
    "the model is equivalent to the ising model of ferromagnetism and was already used to simulate surface diffusion at high temperatures @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite in particular , it was employed to study the effects of an attractive interaction @xmath0 on surface diffusion on a triangular lattice ( for @xmath17 ) and on a square lattice ( for @xmath18 and @xmath0 attractive ) .",
    "@xcite note that these temperatures are above the critical values @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the two lattices ( for a hexagonal lattice the critical point is @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xcite    at low temperatures model   is known to have only two phases : a fully vacant phase at @xmath22 and a fully occupied phase at @xmath23 ; at @xmath24 both phases coexist .",
    "@xcite thus , the models exhibits a first - order transition at @xmath25 between the fully vacant and fully occupied phase .",
    "the point @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the lattice coordination number ( equal to @xmath28 , @xmath3 , and @xmath29 for the three lattices ) .",
    "migration due to surface diffusion is represented by jumps of adparticles to nearby vacant sites . for simplicity , we shall assume that these jumps are uncorrelated and occur only between _ nn _ sites .",
    "the influence of adparticles on the activation energy of a jump will be taken into account via an ( attractive or repulsive ) interaction , @xmath1 , that is different from @xmath0 and acts between an activated particle and its closest adparticles .",
    "@xcite thus , this interaction is associated with segments , @xmath30 , of more than two adsorption sites ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : segm ] ) : a pair of _ nn _ sites between which a particle jump is performed , plus the closest sites to the pair s center ( over which a saddle point of the potential relief is located ) .     and @xmath31",
    ". the segments @xmath30 are indicated by shaded areas . ]",
    "relevant many - particle transport parameters for surface diffusion are the chemical and jump diffusion coefficients , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the former coefficient describes surface mass - transport processes of the system and is defined via the fick s first law ; the latter describes the asymptotic behavior of the mean square displacement of the system center of mass .",
    "they are related by the kubo - green equation , @xmath32 , @xcite where @xmath33 is the surface coverage , @xmath34 is the isothermal susceptibility , and @xmath35 is the inverse temperature .",
    "as long as the coverage varies only very slowly with time and space ( i.e. , the local equilibrium limit is applicable ) , purely thermodynamic quantities are sufficient to approximate the two diffusion coefficients , @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the diffusion coefficient of non - interacting particles .",
    "the correlation factor @xmath38 is associated with the interaction of activated particles and may be written as @xcite @xmath39 the summation is over all subsets @xmath40 of a segment @xmath30 that contain the pair of _ nn _ sites between which a jump is performed , including @xmath30 itself ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : prob ] ) , and @xmath41 is the number of sites in @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 is the statistical average that the sites of @xmath40 are vacant and the remaining sites in @xmath30 are occupied .",
    "for example , for a triangular lattice and @xmath43 we have @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are the sites of @xmath30 and @xmath48 and @xmath31 are the _ nn _ sites associated with a particle jump .",
    "taking into account that there may be several sets @xmath40 yielding the same value of the average @xmath42 , one explicitly has @xcite    [ eq : p expl ] @xmath49    for the square and hexagonal lattices , where the shorthand @xmath50 .     of finding holes at the sites of @xmath40 ( indicated by circles ) and particles at the other sites of @xmath30 ( indicated by disks ) for the three lattices .",
    "a given @xmath42 may correspond to several sets @xmath40 of which only one is shown ( for example , there are two sets @xmath51 on a triangular lattice associated with @xmath52 ) . ]",
    "according to eq .  , in the local equilibrium limit the diffusion coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 become thermodynamic quantities .",
    "a rather powerful statistical mechanical machinery @xcite was developed to study such quantities at low temperatures .",
    "we shall apply it here to investigate the coverage dependences of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , focusing on their variations with the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . before doing so , let us mention two peculiar features of systems at low temperatures that underlie the forthcoming results .",
    "the first one is the structure of phases . at low temperatures a typical microstate in a given phase",
    "looks as a ` sea ' of a ground state in which isolated ` islands ' of non - ground - state configurations are scattered .",
    "@xcite for the fully vacant ( occupied ) phase in model   this corresponds to a sea of holes ( particles ) with islands of particles ( holes ) .",
    "the islands are small , with diameters of order not exceeding @xmath53 , yet their bulk density is non - zero , of order @xmath54 . in fact , the smallest islands ( of one or few sites ) yield the dominant contributions to the system s free energy . as a result , in a given phase the coverage has a practically constant value corresponding to the ground state associated with the phase ( a value @xmath55 or @xmath48 for model  ) , the deviations being just of order @xmath56 .",
    "hence , at low temperatures a significant change in the coverage can possibly occur only at or very near a transition between phases .",
    "the second feature is the smoothing of a discontinuity in a thermodynamic quantity ( such as the coverage ) at a first - order phase transition in a finite system . at low temperatures the profile of the smoothing is identical ( given by the function @xmath57 ) for a large group of lattice - gas models .",
    "@xcite this allows one to described the dependence of thermodynamic quantities on the coverage in a unified way .",
    "these facts can be used to obtain general low - temperature formulas for the coverage dependences of @xmath6 and @xmath7 associated with a first - order phase transition between two phases .",
    "@xcite in the case of model   they read @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total number of adsorption sites in the system , and the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the coverages and correlation factors , respectively , evaluated at the transition point @xmath25 in the fully vacant ( symbol ` @xmath62 ' ) and fully occupied ( symbol ` @xmath63 ' ) phase .",
    "the shorthand @xmath64 is the coverage discontinuity at the transition .",
    "formulas   work for a system with periodic boundary conditions and for coverages @xmath65 .",
    "this is almost the whole interval @xmath66 , as @xmath67 and @xmath68 at low temperatures ( see eq .",
    "the formulas show that the coefficient @xmath6 behaves as a sum of two hyperbolas diverging at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , and the coefficient @xmath7 as a hyperbola @xmath71 diverging at @xmath55 ( see fig  [ fig : d gen ] ) .",
    "no divergences in @xmath6 or @xmath7 actually occur , however , because for @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 one of the two phases prevails in the system , and formulas different from eq .",
    "become valid .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , in the following we shall use only eq .   since it is applicable to practically all coverages .     the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 can not be simultaneously negative .",
    "]    the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 affect the diffusion coefficients via the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath60 , @xmath77 , and @xmath25 that we shall now evaluate .",
    "note that @xmath1 appears only in the correlation factors @xmath61 ( via the exponential @xmath78 ) , whereas the interaction @xmath0 affects @xmath61 ( via the averages @xmath79 ) as well as the coverages @xmath60 and location of the transition point @xmath25 .      at low temperatures ,",
    "the leading contributions to the free energy in a given phase come from single - site thermal perturbations of the ground state . in the vacant phase",
    "such a perturbation corresponds to microstate with an energy excess @xmath80 over the vacant ground state , while in the occupied phase the excess is @xmath81 .",
    "these excesses correspond to the boltzmann factors @xmath82 and @xmath83 $ ] , respectively .",
    "hence , @xcite @xmath84 note that this yields @xmath85 .    in an analogous way",
    ", we may obtain the single - phase averages @xmath86 and @xmath87 at the transition .",
    "consider , for example , the average @xmath88 on a square lattice .",
    "it corresponds to addition of two _ nn _ adparticles to the fully vacant ground state ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : prob ] ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath89 corresponds to removal of four adparticles in an elementary square from the fully occupied ground state .",
    "the energy excesses of these microstates are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "thus , within the leading - order approximation , @xmath92 = \\exp(3{\\varepsilon}{\\beta})$ ] and @xmath93 = \\exp(4{\\varepsilon}{\\beta})$ ] . in this way the leading terms in all averages @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be deduced ( see table  [ tab : p_m ] ) .",
    "although this evaluation is heuristic , it can be shown to be actually correct .",
    "@xcite it must be taken into account , however , that there may be two or three different types of perturbations of a ground state corresponding to the leading term in @xmath86 or @xmath87 , yielding a non - unit multiplicative prefactor in such a case .",

    "[ fig : p ] . obviously , there is a single dominant term in @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath1 either well below or well above a certain value , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",

    "the ranges in which the terms corresponding to the sets @xmath101 and @xmath102 are dominant are indicated , and the sum of these two terms for each factor and each lattice is shown by a dotted line . ]",
    "equations    provide explicit dependences of the diffusion coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 on the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we may simplify these dependences and make thus their further analysis easier , if we use that for any @xmath1 only one term in @xmath94 and @xmath95 is dominant in the coefficients .",

    "equation   will allow us to easily analyze the influence of the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the diffusion coefficients .",

    "@xcite indeed , for @xmath131 eq .   reduces to @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "then the free energy of model   is sufficient to evaluate @xmath38 .",

    "instead , one should use the free energy of a more complex version of model   in which the needed multi - site interactions are added .",
    "@xcite    * case 2 : * the interaction @xmath0 is fixed and the value of @xmath1 varies . then it would be anticipated that the diffusion coefficients decrease with @xmath1 repulsive and grow with @xmath1 attractive .",

    "we stressed that at low temperatures a phase transition is necessary whenever a coverage dependence of any quantity is to be explored ; far from transitions a single phase is stable in the system and the coverage is almost constant .",

    "then surface diffusion was exponentially accelerated ( decelerated ) whenever @xmath155 ( @xmath147 ) , where the threshold value @xmath166 .",
    "thus , an @xmath1 comparable to @xmath0 is enough to boost diffusion on the square and hexagonal lattices ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) , while on the triangular lattice @xmath1 must be more than four times as attractive as @xmath0 .    the key ingredient underlying our investigation was eq .  .",
    "it allows one to study the case of any relation , @xmath169 , between the two interactions ; the linear relation @xmath143 was considered due to its simplicity . moreover , since the equation is of rather general nature , @xcite the approach presented here for model   can be applied also to other models on homogeneous or even heterogeneous lattices . this only requires to calculate the single - phase correlation factors and coverages for the studied model and at a given phase transition , which is simple to carry out heuristically , as was shown in section  [ sec : res ] .",

    "<S> finally , when @xmath1 is set proportional to @xmath0 via a parameter @xmath2 , surface diffusion is exponentially accelerated ( decelerated ) for @xmath2 above ( below ) a threshold value equal to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for the three lattices . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an @xmath1 of strength comparable to @xmath0 is enough to boost diffusion on the square and hexagonal lattices , while an @xmath1 of a rather large strength is needed for the boost on the triangular lattice . </S>"
