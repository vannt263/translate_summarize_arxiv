    "protostellar outflows have strong molecular hydrogen emission in the wavelength range covered by the _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared array camera ( irac ) . _ spitzer _ studies of known outflows reveal that shocked h@xmath0 emission appears particularly strong in the 4.5 @xmath3 m irac band @xcite .",
    "many groups are beginning to visually inspect irac data to search for outflows and objects with extended h@xmath0 emission based on the strong emission in the 4.5 @xmath3 m band . @xcite",
    "created synthetic _ spitzer _",
    "images from their models of precessing protostellar jets .",
    "these models calculated the population of the first three vibrational levels by solving for statistical equilibrium and assuming local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) for the rotational levels .",
    "their simulations showed that the emission in the 4.5 @xmath3 m band to be the strongest , which was consistent with observations . in taking a census of the young stellar objects ( ysos ) in ngc 1333 , @xcite empirically determined an irac color cut based on observations of known shocked emission within ngc 1333 .",
    "this was used to remove any possible shocked emission in their source list of ysos . due to the multitude of lines in the irac bands",
    "it was thought that information on the physical parameters of the gas could not be ascertained from the _ spitzer _ irac data . in analyzing the irac images of ic 443 ,",
    "@xcite calculated the irac band ratios for shocked h@xmath0 using the 13 strongest lines covered by irac but only included collisional excitation by h@xmath0 and he in their calculations .",
    "they found the measured flux in the 3.6 @xmath3 m band to be stronger than predicted in their calculations , which may have been due to neglecting collisional excitation with atomic hydrogen .",
    "until now , the color space of shocked h@xmath0 emission due collisional excitation with atomic hydrogen , he , and h@xmath0 has not been calculated .    in order to use _ spitzer _",
    "irac data to find outflows and study their properties we have calculated the irac color space of shocked h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we have calculated the intensities of shocked molecular hydrogen and determined the location of the shocked emission within irac color space . at typical shock temperatures and densities",
    ", the excitation of molecular hydrogen is through collisions with h atoms and he atoms , and with ground state ortho- and para - h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the typical densities in outflows are less than critical so we do not assume lte",
    ". instead the populations of the first 47 ro - vibrational excited states were calculated from solving the equations of statistical equilibrium where we set @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the atomic hydrogen fraction was set to the median value consistent with shock models and the temperature range we chose @xcite . to solve the equations we employed a non - lte code based on the method by @xcite .",
    "we used the latest h - h@xmath0 non - reactive collisional rate coefficients calculated by @xcite .",
    "the reactive collisional rate coefficients were derived from the relations of @xcite .",
    "the rate coefficients for he - h@xmath0 and h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collisions are from @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the states is given by @xmath7 for even @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for odd @xmath8 .",
    "the quadrupole transition probabilities used are from @xcite .",
    "we calculated the populations of the states over a wide range of atomic hydrogen densities , @xmath10 @xmath11 , and gas temperatures , @xmath12 k. the relative intensities of 49 lines that fall within the irac bands ( 3.08 @xmath3 m @xmath13 10.5 @xmath3 m ) were determined and used to calculate the irac band fluxes using the latest published irac spectral response @xcite and calibration data @xcite .",

    "figure 1 shows location of shocked h@xmath0 gas in irac @xmath1 -[4.5]$ ] vs. @xmath2-[5.8]$ ] color space .",
    "we find that the observed emission in the bands is a function of kinetic gas temperature and atomic hydrogen density .",
    "we restrict our plot to gas temperatures below 4000 k where h@xmath0 emission is expected to be the dominant .",
    "shocks that would produce gas temperatures in excess of 4000 k are likely to be dissociative ( j - type ) decreasing the abundance of h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "these shocks are also likely to produce vibrationally excited co emission and fine structure [ ] emission in addition to the h@xmath0 emission . the co molecule , which has a higher dissociation energy than h@xmath0 , is able to survive at higher shock velocities and temperatures . in these high energy shocks , co becomes vibrationally excited and emits in @xmath18 ( 4.45 @xmath3 m @xmath19 4.9 @xmath3 m ) lines and can contribute significantly to the total emission from the shocked gas .",
    "furthermore , the majority of [ ] lines in the range covered by irac fall within the 4.5 @xmath3 m band .",
    "consequently , 4.5 @xmath3 m emission in excess to the color space defined by h@xmath0 at 4000 k is likely to trace gas with t @xmath20 4000 k placing shocked emission into the upper left portion of the color - color diagram .",
    "we chose not to use the 8 @xmath3 m band as there may be dust and pah contamination in this band .",
    "pah emission is particularly strong in the 8 @xmath3 m band and it is still unclear what contribution pahs may have in the emission of shocked gas from outflows . dust continuum emission also becomes a possibility as dust may survive the shock . furthermore our calculations are restricted to a single temperature along the line of sight . in the case of multiple temperature components ,",
    "the cooler gas will significantly contribute to the lower excitation pure rotational lines , 0@xmath210 @xmath17(4 ) and 0@xmath210 @xmath17(5 ) , that dominate the emission in the 8 @xmath3 m band .",
    "the 8 @xmath3 m band would then trace the cooler temperature component while the other bands would be more sensitive to the hotter gas .",
    "thus our analysis can include gas containing multiple temperature components along the line of sight but will still be restricted to analyzing only the hotter gas .    as seen in figure 1 , the shocked h@xmath0 lies in a well defined location in the color - color diagram . for comparison ,",
    "the location of ysos is also shown in the figure based on the criteria of @xcite and @xcite . shocked h@xmath0 gas with sufficiently high temperature and atomic hydrogen density",
    "is found in a unique location on this diagram and can be distinguished from ysos .",
    "this is consistent with the empirically determined color cut of @xcite .",
    "therefore these colors offer an unambiguous method for searching for shocked gas from outflows / jets . however , there is overlap in irac color space between low temperature shocked h@xmath0 gas and protostellar sources .",
    "consequently surveys searching for outflows using irac color analysis will be restricted to finding flows containing higher excitation gas .",
    "additional data at different wavelengths ( 2mass , mips , etc . ) and/or morphology may be able to break this degeneracy .",
    "our results are consistent with empirical observations of strong 4.5 @xmath3 m emission in outflows and with the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .    using this color analysis ,",
    "two methods can be applied to identify outflows in the images : 1 ) visual inspection of 3-color images constructed out of the 3.6 @xmath3 m , 4.5 @xmath3 m , and 5.8 @xmath3 m band data with appropriate scaling to enhance the shocked emission , and 2 ) analysis of the photometry of the field where features consistent with colors of shocked h@xmath0 emission are selected .",
    "this can be accomplished by evaluating the color pixel by pixel across the field .",
    "the location of the shocked h@xmath0 in color space depends on its temperature .",
    "therefore color analysis provides a new way to probe the temperature structure of the gas .",
    "this can be accomplished by evaluating the colors pixel by pixel across the field .",
    "the colors can then be compared to the colors of shocked h@xmath0 and the temperature of the gas can be estimated .",
    "resulting temperature maps are restricted to temperatures between @xmath22 k and high atomic hydrogen densities .",
    "the color space for h@xmath0 at temperature less than 2000 k moves further into the color space of class i/0 objects and it becomes more likely to misidentify scattered light from ysos as h@xmath0 emission .",
    "note that , at low atomic hydrogen densities the constant temperature lines start to converge and thus temperature estimates from this region of color space may have large uncertainties .",
    "we applied our analysis to _ spitzer _ archival data of the known outflow .",
    "we evaluated the irac colors at each pixel in the field of hh 54 .",
    "the median value of the image was used to estimate the background and was subtracted from the images . figure 2 shows the color - color diagram for the knots ( a , b , c , e , k , m ) of shocked h@xmath0 previously studied by @xcite .",
    "we plot all the pixels on the diagram that are encompassed by the knots .",
    "the majority of points fall within our calculated color space for shocked h@xmath0 emission .",
    "one exception is knot a which contains several pixels with colors that fall more than 3@xmath23 outside the 4000 k boundary .",
    "this region of color space with excess 4.5 @xmath3 m emission is consistent with higher gas temperatures and possible additional emission from co @xmath18 and [ ] .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopic data of various knots in hh 54 in the near - infrared and used h@xmath0 emission lines to estimate the rotational and vibrational excitational temperatures of the gas .",
    "we created a temperature map of hh 54 ( figure 3 ) by selecting the pixels whose colors fall within the range we identified as belonging to shocked h@xmath0 ( @xmath24 k ) and @xmath2-[5.8 ] \\leq 1.5 $ ] , and then estimated the temperature of the gas based on the pixels location in color space .",
    "the estimated temperatures are compared to the vibrational ( @xmath25 ) excitation temperatures obtained by @xcite in table 2 .",
    "because typical atomic hydrogen densities in shocks are less than critical , the gas can not be assumed to be in lte . in these environments",
    "the rotational temperatures are often far below the kinetic gas temperature , while the ro - vibrational @xmath26 excitation temperatures are close to the kinetic gas temperature . for most of the knots",
    "the temperatures we estimate from color analysis and the spectroscopically determined temperatures are consistent .",
    "there is an additional knot , labeled i ( @xmath27=12:55:54.8 , @xmath28=-76:56:06 ) , 5 arcseconds to the east of knot c seen in the irac images that is not found in the nir images of hh 54 which we identify as the mid - infrared counterpart to the optical knot @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the gas in this knot peaks at 3500 k as seen in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "this knot is also found on the edge of the [ ] 12.8 @xmath3 m map of hh 54 by @xcite .",
    "the presence of the fine - structure [ ] line is consistent with the high temperature structure of this knot .",
    "knot b ( @xmath29 k)is also found to be spatially coincident with strong [ ] 12.8 @xmath3 m emission .",
    "the distribution of the [ ] 26 @xmath3 m line @xcite covers a region containing knots a , b , m. we find that spatial distribution of fine - structure emission lines is consistent with regions within our temperature map where @xmath30 k. knots a , b , and i are spatially aligned with each other as indicated by the green line in figure 3 .",
    "these high temperature knots may trace the jet component of the outflow .",
    "this line points in the direction of iras 12496 - 7650 which is believed to be the source of the outflow .",
