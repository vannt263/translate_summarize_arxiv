    "following the approach of @xcite and borrowing some of their notation , we apply a bayesian formalism to our survey results to estimate an upper limit for the fraction @xmath2 of objects ( having @xmath3 km ) which are active mbcs at the time of observation . the prior probability distribution on @xmath2 is chosen to be a log - constant function :    @xmath4    this prior is justified since we know @xmath2 is `` small '' , but not to order - of - magnitude precision .",
    "the minimum value @xmath5 is allowed to be arbitrarily small , since the integral of @xmath6 is always unity :    @xmath7    let @xmath8 be the number of objects in a given sample , @xmath9 the number of active mbcs positively detected in that sample , and @xmath10 the completeness or efficiency of our mbc - detection scheme . in section 5.5",
    "we discussed how @xmath11 if defining completeness with respect to the extendedness distribution of the 115 known comets on which we tested our detection method .",
    "relative to objects at least as extended as the two known candidate mbcs we tested , however , we can take @xmath12 ( 100% efficiency ) , since both of the mbcs observed were robustly flagged by our screening process .",
    "the likelihood probability distribution function for a general sample @xmath13 is formally a binomial distribution , but because the samples we will be considering are very large ( @xmath14 ) , the likelihood function is well - approximated as a poisson distribution :    @xmath15    bayes theorem then gives the formula for the posterior probability distribution on @xmath2 given our results :    @xmath16    the constant of proportionality ( not shown ) involves incomplete gamma functions ] ] , and is well - defined and finite ( including in the limit @xmath17 ) .",
    "finally , we can compute the 95% confidence upper limit @xmath18 by solving the implicit equation    @xmath19      we first take the sample @xmath13 to be representative of _ all _ main - belt asteroids , which in our survey amounted to @xmath20 observed objects and @xmath21 detected mbcs .",
    "equation ( 14 ) yields 95% confidence upper limits for @xmath2 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for efficiency values of @xmath10 of 0.66 and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "figure 14 depicts the probability distributions for each case .",
    "we note that although these results are based on the positive detection of only two candidate mbcs , the reader need not be skeptical on the basis of `` small number statistics '' , since the possionian posterior ( equation 13 and figure 14 ) formally accounts for `` small number statistics '' through its functional dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "even if we had detected no mbcs at all  in which case @xmath9 would be zero ( as was the case in @xcite)the posterior would still be well - defined ; the 95%-confident upper limit would naturally be larger to reflect the greater uncertainty .",
    "our discussion has so far only considered the _ fraction _ of active mbcs , rather than their _",
    "total number_. this is because an estimate of the total underlying number of main - belt objects ( down to @xmath24 km ) must first be quoted from a properly - debiased survey .",
    "a widely - cited example is @xcite , who applied a debiasing analysis to the spacewatch survey and concluded that there are of order @xmath25 main - belt asteroids ( down to @xmath24 km ) .",
    "since the mbc - fraction estimates in the above paragraphs are conveniently given in units of per million main - belt asteroids , we directly estimate the upper limit on the total number of active mbcs in the true underlying @xmath3 km population ( again to 95% confidence ) to be between 33 and 22 , depending on the efficiency factor @xmath10 ( 0.66 or 1.0 ) .",
    "case reflects our efficiency with respect to the extendedness distribution of all known comets , while the @xmath12 case applies to extendedness levels at least as high as the two known candidate mbcs in our sample . in this plot @xmath26",
    "was set to @xmath27 , to facilitate visual comparison of the normalized prior with the normalized posteriors . ]",
    "of the seven candidate mbcs listed in table 1 , all except 259p / garradd have semi - major axes between 3.0 au and 3.3 au , corresponding approximately to the 9:4 and 2:1 jupiter resonances ( kirkwood gaps ) .",
    "this semi - major axis constraint is satisfied by 123,366 ( @xmath020% ) of the known objects as of august 2012 , of which 47,450 ( 38% ) are included in the ptf sample .",
    "reapplying equations ( 10)(14 ) except now using @xmath28 ( while @xmath21 remains unchanged ) , we find 95%-confidence upper limits of 160 and 110 active mbcs per million outer main - belt asteroids with @xmath29 and @xmath3 km , for detection efficiencies of @xmath11 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "although only @xmath020% of the _ known _ main - belt asteroids lie in this orbital range , the debiased semi - major axis distribution presented in @xcite predicts that @xmath030% of all main - belt objects ( of @xmath3 km ) lie in this outer region .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the fact that these objects are more difficult to detect , since they are further away and tend to have lower albedos ( this lower detection efficiency is evident for instance in the wise sample shown in figure 3 ) . assuming 300,000 objects actually comprise this debiased outer main - belt region , the inferred 95% confidence upper limit on the total number of active mbcs existing in this region is @xmath050 ( for @xmath11 ) and @xmath030 ( for @xmath30 ) .",
    "four out of the seven candidate mbcs in table 1 have orbital inclinations of @xmath31 .",
    "combined with the semi - major - axis constraint @xmath29 , this associates them with ( or close to ) the themis asteroid family .",
    "there are 25,069 objects in the small - body list we used which satisfy this combined constraint on @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath04% of the known main - belt ) , of which 8,451 ( 34% ) are included in the ptf sample .    again reapplying equations ( 10)(14 )",
    ", we now use @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where the new value for @xmath9 reflects the fact that p/2006 vw@xmath1 satisfies this @xmath33-criterion while p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) does not .",
    "we find 95%-confidence upper limits of 540 and 360 active mbcs per million low - inclination , outer main - belt asteroids , for detection efficiencies of @xmath11 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "once again , @xcite offer estimates of the debiased number of objects in the underlying population of interest : for outer main - belt asteroids , they found that @xmath020% of the debiased objects had @xmath31 .",
    "hence , assuming there are 60,000 objects ( of @xmath3 km ) in the actual low-@xmath33 outer main - belt population satisfying these @xmath32 and @xmath33 constraints , the resulting upper limit estimates for the total number of active mbcs it contains is @xmath030 ( for @xmath11 ) and @xmath020 ( for @xmath30 ) .      of the 8,451 low - inclination",
    "outer main - belt objects observed by ptf ( see section 7.4 ) , 5,202 were observed in the orbital quadrant centered on perihelion ( in terms of true orbital anomaly @xmath37 , this quadrant is @xmath36 ) .",
    "we consider this constraint given that all known candidate mbcs ( table 1 ) have shown activity near perihelion .",
    "now using @xmath38 and @xmath35 ( here again @xmath35 represents p/2006 vw@xmath1 ) , we find 95%-confidence upper limits of 880 and 570 active mbcs per million low - inclination , outer main - belt asteroids observed by ptf near perihelion , for detection efficiencies of @xmath11 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we caution that , unlike the previous subsets ( which were defined solely by orbital elements ) , the population to which these statistics apply is less well - defined .",
    "in particular , the bias for detection near perihelion ( figure 15 ) , due in part to the @xmath39 dependence in the reflected sunlight , is more pronounced for smaller , lower - albedo , higher eccentricity objects .",
    "hence , naively imposing a constraint on true anomaly @xmath37 implictly introduces selection biases in @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . moreover , these implicit biases depend on the sensitivity of the ptf survey in a more nuanced manner , invalidating the simple @xmath43-km lower limit we have quoted generally in this work .",
    "nonetheless , these parameters ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) are important enough to merit individual treatment , as detailed below .",
    "yet another constraint that well - encompasses the known mbc candidates of table 1 is a diameter @xmath44 5 km ( corresponding to approximately @xmath45 mag for albedo @xmath46 ) . applying this constraint decreases the number of ptf - sampled objects @xmath47 by 28% , 45% and 41% for the entire main - belt , outer main - belt , and low-@xmath33 outer main - belt , respectively .",
    "these smaller sample sizes result in slightly higher 95%-confidence upper limits for the fraction of active mbcs : 3045 , 180280 , and 610920 per @xmath25 objects having @xmath48 in the entire main - belt , outer main - belt , and low-@xmath33 outer main - belt , respectively ( the ranges corresponding to the two values of the efficiency factor @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the debiased differential number distribution as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath49 is @xmath0@xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting cumulative number distribution ( _ i.e. _ , the number of asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude @xmath49 ) is @xmath0@xmath52 .",
    "using @xmath53 in this expression gives the predicted @xmath25 asteroids having @xmath3 km .",
    "the fraction of these objects in the range @xmath54 is therefore @xmath55% .",
    "scaling the debiased populations discussed above by this factor and using the new limits from the preceding paragraph gives new upper limits on the _ total _ number of active mbcs existing in the three regions : @xmath02436 , @xmath04070 , and @xmath03045 in the entire main - belt , outer main - belt , and low-@xmath33 outer main - belt , respectively .",
    "@xcite analyzed wise observations of five of the active - main - belt objects listed in table 1 . by fitting thermal models to the observations , they found that all of these objects had visible albedos of @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in figure 3 and described in section 3.4 , about half of the asteroids which were observed by wise also appear in the ptf sample ; in particular there were @xmath57 low - albedo ( @xmath56 ) objects observed by both surveys . included in the @xcite sample",
    "was ptf - observed candidate mbc p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) , whose fitted albedo of @xmath58 implies we can take @xmath35 ( one positive active mbc - detection ) in the low - albedo wise / ptf sample .    following the 95% confidence upper limit computation method of the previous sections , we derive upper limits of 90140 active mbcs per @xmath25 low - albedo ( @xmath56 ) asteroids . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the full - debiasing of the wise albedo distribution @xcite will eventually allow us to convert this upper limit on the _ fraction _ of active mbcs among low - albedo asteroids into an upper limit on their _ total number _ , just as @xcite has allowed us to do for orbital and size distributions .      the mbc candidate p/2006",
    "vw@xmath1 was observed serendipitously by sdss on two nights in september 2000 . while one of the nights was not photometric in @xmath59-band ,",
    "the other night provided reliable @xmath60 multi - color data on this object , yielding a principal component color @xmath61 .",
    "because it has @xmath62 , this suggests p/2006 vw@xmath1 is a carbonaceous ( c - type ) object has been confirmed spectroscopically by @xcite and @xcite . ] .",
    "figure 3 depicts the overlap of the sdss - observed sample with ptf , which includes @xmath63 c - type ( @xmath62 ) objects .",
    "taking @xmath35 , we derive 95% confident upper - limits of 120190 active mbcs per @xmath25 c - type asteroids ( where again the range corresponds to @xmath11@xmath64 ) .",
    "using original kd - tree - based software and stringent quality filters , we have harvested observations of @xmath040% ( @xmath0220,000 ) of the known solar system small bodies and 626 new objects ( 622 asteroids and 4 comets ) from the first 41 months of ptf survey data ( march 2009 through july 2012 ) .",
    "this sample is untargeted with respect to the orbital elements of known small bodies ( but not necessarily the _ true _ underlying population ) , down to @xmath01-km diameter - sized objects .",
    "most ( @xmath090% ) of the objects are observed on less than @xmath010 distinct nights , and @xmath090% are observed over less than 1/6 of their orbit , allowing us to characterize this sample predominantly as a `` snapshot '' of objects in select regions of their orbits .",
    "we have introduced a metric for quantifying the extendedness of a small body in an image , and have corrected this metric , on a per - observation basis , for systematic variation due to observables such as apparent magnitude , on - sky motion and pixel - grid alignment . in this metric",
    ", an extendedness of zero describes stellar - like ( asteroidal ) objects , whereas a positive value indicates potentially cometary extendedness .",
    "we defined a sample for visual screening consisting of all objects whose mean extendedness value is greater than zero by at least one - sigma .",
    "this screening sample consisted of @xmath01,500 unique objects , 76 ( out of 115 ) comets , and two known candidate active mbcs , p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) and p/2006 vw@xmath1 , which upon inspection appear active and visibly extended in the images . of the @xmath01,500 objects screened , we found evidence for activity on two known ( non - main - belt ) asteroidally - designated objects , 2010 kg@xmath65 and 2011 cr@xmath66 , and confirmed activity on the three out of the four ( non - main - belt ) comets that our moving - object algorithm discovered .    given these results , using a log - constant prior we infer with 95% confidence an upper limit of @xmath67 active mbcs per @xmath25 main - belt asteroids for a @xmath11 detection efficiency with respect to the extendedness distribution of known comets , and @xmath68 active mbcs per @xmath25 main - belt asteroids for a 100% efficiency with respect to objects",
    "at least as extended as the known candidate active mbcs in our sample .",
    "our inferred 95% confidence upper limit of at most @xmath030 active mbcs per @xmath25 main - belt asteroids of @xmath3 km is comparable but slightly lower than that of gilbert and wiegert ( @xcite , @xcite ) , who estimated @xmath69 active mbcs per @xmath25 main - belt asteroids , also for @xmath3 km , from visual inspection of a similarly untargeted sample of @xmath025,000 objects from the _ canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey _ ( gilbert and wiegert ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "that result was based on the detection of a single unknown comet in their sample , which was never actually confirmed to be a main - belt object due to lack of follow - up observations . even before taking into account our order - of - magnitude larger sample size , we note that , in contrast to their results , our limits are based on positive mbc detections and use detection efficiencies estimated from observations of @xmath0100 known comets .",
    "the result of @xcite was a much larger upper limit of @xmath03,000 mbcs per @xmath25 main - belt asteroids ( to 90% confidence ) , albeit applicable to the smaller limiting diameter of @xmath00.5 km .",
    "their smaller sample size of 924 objects is certainly the cause for their much larger uncertainty .",
    "while their detection methods were proven robust with respect to known candidate mbcs , we note that their sample included no unambiguously cometary objects .",
    "hence , it is difficult to compare our result to theirs , but the possibility of a steeply increasing number distribution for mbcs below the @xmath01-km level is not ruled out . indeed , two known candidate mbcs , 238p / read and 259p / garradd , have measured sub - kilometer diameters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as suggested by this article s title , extended - object analysis is only the first kind of cometary - detection method to which we intend on subjecting the ptf small - body data set . in a planned part ii to this study , we hope to analyze the time- ( and mean - anomaly- ) varying absolute magnitude of small bodies over orbital - period baselines , which could potentially reveal even unresolved cometary activity",
    ".    preliminary analysis of ptf photometry of main - belt comet p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) , which include pre - discovery observations , shows a time - resolved @xmath01.5-mag increase in absolute magnitude and a corresponding factor @xmath05 increase in the dust - to - nucleus cross - section ratio , @xmath70 .",
    "these results suggest ptf is capable of detecting intrinsic disk - integrated flux variation at the level of known candidate mbcs .",
    "upcoming analyses of other known comets in our sample should confirm this robustness .",
    "as shown in figure 15 , the orbital - coverage of ptf - observed known objects is far from complete .",
    "the orbital period of main - belt objects varies from about three to six years ; a desirable prerequisite to orbital variation analysis is a comparable survey duration ( especially to alleviate the bias against longer - period outer main - belt objects ) .",
    "the use of only two visible - band filters2 million small - body observations in this work are in mould-@xmath71-band , 13% in @xmath72-band . ]",
    "gives ptf an advantage over other ongoing surveys3 million small - body observations reported to the minor planet center by _ pan - starrs 1 _ ( ps1 ) as of mid-2012 , @xmath040% are @xmath73-band ( a wide - band filter covering most of the visible ) , while @xmath59- , @xmath74- and @xmath33-bands each represent @xmath020% of the ps1 data .",
    "] , since conversion between wavelength bands introduces uncertainty when object colors are unknown .",
    "thus , multi - filter data makes absolute magnitude comparison between epochs ( already complicated by uncertainties in spin amplitudes and phase functions ) even more difficult .",
    "finally , a photometric variation analysis would benefit from the inclusion of null - detections , which are not currently a product of our kd - tree harvesting method , but should be implementable with a reasonable amount of modification .",
    "this work is based on data obtained with the 1.2-m samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory as part of the palomar transient factory project , a scientific collaboration between the california institute of technology , columbia university , las cumbres observatory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , the national energy research scientific computing center , the university of oxford , and the weizmann institute of science ( wis ) .",
