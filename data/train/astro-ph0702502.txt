    "the composition of dark halos around galaxies is a difficult problem . many of the baryons in the universe are dark and at least some of these dark baryons could be in galactic halos in the form of very massive objects ( vmos ) , with masses above @xmath9 m@xmath1 .",
    "astrophysically motivated candidates include massive compact halo objects ( machos ) and black holes either of intermediate mass ( imbhs ; @xmath10 to @xmath11 m@xmath1 ) or massive ( @xmath12 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "imbhs are an intringuing possibility as they could contribute , in principle , to all the baryonic dark matter and may be the engines behind ultraluminous x - ray sources recently discovered in nearby galaxies .    a successful model in which vmos are the dominant component of dark matter halos could resolve some long - standing problems @xcite . if the halos of dsphs are comprised by black holes of masses between @xmath5 and @xmath13 m@xmath1 , they evolve towards a shallower inner profile in less than a hubble time , providing an explanation for the origin of dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies , and the orbits of globular clusters ( gcs ) do not shrink to the center by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "very few observational limits on vmos in dsph halos have been derived so far .",
    "this letter is aimed at constraining the mass and abundance of vmos in the halos of dsphs by the disruptive effects they would have on gcs and cold long - lived substructures .",
    "fornax is a dark dominated dsph galaxy with an unusually high gc frequency for its dynamical mass . in order to place dynamical constraints on the mass of vmos by requiring that not too many gcs",
    "are disrupted , the density of vmos @xmath14 with mass @xmath15 along the orbits of the gcs should be known .",
    "since the three - dimensional distances of the gcs to the center of fornax are unknown , the density of vmos at a mean distance of @xmath16 kpc will be adopted .",
    "by @xmath17 we will denote the halo mass fraction in vmos , i.e.  @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the halo density ; @xmath20@xmath21 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 at @xmath22 kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite give the `` survival diagram '' of gcs , considering different encounter histories for @xmath23 m@xmath1 pc@xmath24 and a velocity dispersion of halo particles @xmath25 km s@xmath26 .",
    "the survival diagram establishes the range of mass and concentration such that gcs with central densities between @xmath0 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 and @xmath27 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 ( or , equivalently , core radii between @xmath7 and @xmath28 pc ) have a probability of less than @xmath29 to survive after @xmath30 gyr .",
    "since the dissolution timescale for a certain gc ( and a given @xmath15 ) scales as @xmath31 , and @xmath32 km / s in fornax , it will be a factor of @xmath33@xmath34 less in fornax as compared to the galactic case considered by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the survival diagram for fornax s gcs can be derived at once ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : klessen ] ) .",
    "gcs in the region above the thick line have a probability of less than @xmath35 to survive in a dark halo with @xmath36 m@xmath37 pc@xmath3 .",
    "for such a @xmath38 value and if the present parameters of the gcs are representative of their parameters at the time they formed , we would be observing the lucky survivors of an initial population of @xmath39 gcs of @xmath40 m@xmath1 , which turns out to be very unrealistic for a galaxy with a v - band luminosity of @xmath41 l@xmath1 .",
    "it is possible to estimate the probability that we are observing only the survivors of a larger original population that are in the process of quick disruption @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the dissolution age of gcs is expected to follow a scale - free power law @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the characteristic dissolution timescale and @xmath44 is the age of the cluster population @xcite .",
    "[ fig : klessen ] shows that at least @xmath45 gcs are above the thick line ; this indicates that their present disruption timescales are @xmath46 .",
    "if the exponent of distribution of lifetimes is @xmath47 , as derived for galactic gcs @xcite , the probability to have @xmath45 out of @xmath48 gcs with lifetimes less than @xmath49 is @xmath50 , whereas the probability that the lifetimes of all the gcs are less then @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",
    "hence the probability that the whole dark halo is comprised of objects with masses @xmath53 m@xmath1 is less than @xmath29 .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath17 of the dark mass is in compact objects of mass @xmath15 , then @xmath54 m@xmath55 .",
    "localized regions with enhanced stellar density and , where data permit , extremely cold kinematics have been detected in some dsphs ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter k03 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , umi dsph has received the most attention .",
    "collecting the velocity of stars in @xmath56 radius aperture , k03 found that a two - gaussian populations , one representing the underlying @xmath57 km / s gaussian and the other with velocity dispersion @xmath58 km / s , representing a subpopulation of fraction @xmath59 , is @xmath60 times more likely than the default @xmath57 km / s .",
    "the best - fit @xmath61 is ill - determined as it is much smaller than the median velocity errors ( @xmath48 km / s ) .",
    "nevertheless , even with these fiducial errors , we can be certain that the velocity dispersion is @xmath62 km / s at @xmath63 confidence level .",
    "the stars which form the secondary density peak are not distinguished in colour and magnitude from the remainder of the umi population @xcite .",
    "in fact , umi star formation history indicates that its stars have been formed in a single burst earlier than @xmath30 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "although umi has long been suspected of experiencing ongoing tidal disruption , regions with enhanced volume density and _ cold kinematics _ can not be the result of tidal interactions because the coarse - grained phase - density , @xmath64 , in collisionless sytems must be constant or even decrease , thus implying that overdensity regions should appear dynamically hotter .",
    "this suggests that the clump is long - lived .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the density peak is a projection effect and that what we are seeing is a cold , low - density tidal tail .",
    "however , numerical experiments have shown that this scenario is very unlikely @xcite .",
    "the most plausible interpretation is that the clump is a disrupted stellar cluster , now surviving in phase - space because the underlying gravitational potential is harmonic ( k03 ) . within this",
    "potential , gravitational encounters with the hypothetical vmos will dominate the orbital diffusion of the stars once they become unbound from the progenitor cluster .",
    "the integrity of the cold clump may impose useful upper limits on the mass of vmos .",
    "the fact that the subpopulation is orbiting within the dark matter core of umi will greatly simplify its dynamical description .",
    "clump s stars will undergo a random walk in momentum space by the collisions with the population of vmos .",
    "here we are interested in the velocity change induced in a star relative to the clump center of mass .",
    "the mean - square velocity change of a star in an encounter with a vmo of mass @xmath15 , and impact parameter @xmath65 , with @xmath66 the clump s median radius , in the impulsive approximation is : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the maximum relative velocity between the clump and the perturber and @xmath69 is the mean - square position of the stars in the clump @xcite . in the opposite case of a head - on collision ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the mean change is comparable to that predicted by the tidal approximation when @xmath71 .",
    "the usual way to proceed is to integrate @xmath72 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spitzer ] ) for impact parameters @xmath73 from @xmath74 to infinity and correct for the encounters in which the tidal approximation fails by a factor @xmath75 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "doing so , and for a distribution of clumps and vmos with a relative one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath76 , we obtain : @xmath77    for umi , the persistence of the clump for a large fraction of a hubble time indicates a core of the dark halo of at least @xmath28-@xmath78 times the size of the orbit of the clump , which is @xmath79 pc . in terms of the stellar core radius ( @xmath80 pc ) , this makes a halo core @xmath81@xmath28 times the stellar core and , consequently , the velocity dispersion of the halo particles in the core is , at least @xmath82@xmath28 times the stellar velocity dispersion , corresponding to @xmath83@xmath84 km / s .",
    "the impulsive approximation is valid for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath61 is the internal one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the subpopulation .",
    "for the encounters with @xmath87 , responsible for most of the velocity impulse , this condition is well satisfied for @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath89 km / s , this requirement is fulfilled within the isothermal dark core of umi .",
    "since stars in the clump are unbound , the self - gravity of the clump in a first approximation can be ignored considering only orbit diffusion in the large - scale harmonic potential of the parent galaxy . in a one - dimensional harmonic potential , a velocity impulse",
    "@xmath90 produces a change in the velocity dispersion @xmath91 , where the brakets @xmath92 refer to the mean value after averaging over one orbit . combining this relation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltav ] ) , we find the change of @xmath61 in a time @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is assumed , since the population of clumps is expected to have a velocity dispersion similar to the stellar background , @xmath96 km / s in umi .",
    "the ratio @xmath97 depends on the model : for a plummer cluster @xmath98 , whereas @xmath99 for both a king profile with a dimensionless potential depth of @xmath100 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a gaussian density distribution . in order to take a conservative value and to facilitate comparison with photometric and theoretical analysis that assume gaussian models , we will adopt @xmath99 constant in time .    by @xmath101",
    "we will indicate the time required for a very cold group of unbound stars @xmath102 , to acquire a velocity dispersion of @xmath103 km / s . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : heating ] ) with @xmath104 we then obtain : @xmath105 since many of the recent dynamical models suggest mean dark matter densities within the stellar core radius of umi @xmath106 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 , corresponding to a central mass - to - light ratio of @xmath107 m@xmath108l@xmath1 @xcite , @xmath109 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 will be accepted as a conservative reference value .    the mean - square radius of the subpopulation increases in time with @xmath61 , according to the relation @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the orbital frequency in the constant - density core .",
    "if the core is dominated by the dark matter component @xmath112 , then @xmath113 if @xmath114 km / s , the mean radius @xmath115 pc .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath116 radius of @xmath117 pc for a gaussian density profile , implying an angular size of almost @xmath118 at the distance of umi ( @xmath119 kpc ) .",
    "this value is comparable to but slightly larger than the observed @xmath116 radius of the secondary peak @xmath120 . as a consequence @xmath121 km / s ; otherwise , the stellar subpopulation would appear more extended and diffuse than it is observed .",
    "this upper value is in agreement with the observations of k03 .",
    "our estimates for the size and velocity dispersion of the subpopulation are independent of the eccentricity of the orbit because there is little variation of the macroscopic properties of the halo , @xmath14 , @xmath122 or @xmath111 , within the core where the clump is orbiting .",
    "nevertheless , the dark halo could have suffered significant evolution due to two - body processes and tidal stirring . for @xmath123",
    "m@xmath1 relaxation processes induce an insignificant change in the internal properties of the halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "tidal heating can lead to a reduction of both the density of dark matter particles and its velocity dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the phase - space density , @xmath124 , for collisionless systems is nearly constant or decreases with time , the rate of energy gained by the clump due to encounters with vmos should have been more intense in the past .",
    "the inclusion of evolution of halo properties by tidal effects would lead to a stringent upper mass limit .    if the stellar progenitor cluster became unbound immediately after formation when supernovae expel the gas content ( @xcite ; k03 ) , @xmath101 should be greater than the age of the cluster @xmath125 gyr .",
    "this requirement combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : t25 ] ) implies : @xmath126    if initially the stellar cluster is gravitationally bound , the increase in the internal energy gained by encounters with vmos will eventually exceed its binding energy after a time @xmath127 .",
    "let us estimate @xmath127 , the time at which the cluster becomes unbound .",
    "k03 infer a total mass of the cluster , @xmath128 , of @xmath129 m@xmath1 . if this cluster followed the recently observed relation between radius and mass of @xcite , @xmath130 pc . adopting the reference values of the dark matter halo ( @xmath109 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 and @xmath131 km / s ) and rescaling the survival diagram of @xcite ( their figure 11 ) for the parameters of umi",
    ", we infer that more than @xmath132 of the clusters with mass @xmath129 m@xmath1 will become unbound after @xmath133 gyr if @xmath134 m@xmath1 . therefore , in order to have a dynamically cold subpopulation with @xmath135 km / s , as that observed in umi at the present time @xmath125 gyr , we need @xmath136 , which implies the following upper limit for @xmath15 @xmath137 other corrosive effects such as mass loss by stellar evolution or tidal heating may also accelerate the dissolution of the cluster",
    ". therefore , our estimates for @xmath127 and , hence , for @xmath15 , are upper limits .",
    "the survival probability after collisions with vmos increases for progenitors that are more compact .",
    "for instance , if the progenitor were a supercluster with a core radius @xmath138 pc and central density @xmath139 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 , the probability of its remaining gravitationally bound after @xmath140 gyr is @xmath141 , for @xmath142 m@xmath1 . hence , there may be a non - negligible probability that such a supercluster has survived bound for @xmath140 gyr and that during the subsequent @xmath45 gyr it is dynamically heated by @xmath143 m@xmath1 vmos to reach @xmath114 km / s at the present time .",
    "unfortunately , the evaporation time for this supercluster , setting the scale for dynamical dissolution by internal processes , is very short .",
    "in fact , for such a stellar cluster , the evaporation time is @xmath144 , with @xmath145 the half - mass relaxation time @xcite .",
    "the resulting evaporation time is @xmath146 gyr for an average stellar mass @xmath147 m@xmath1 and , hence , internal processes would have produced a fast desintegration of such a cluster .",
    "we conclude that the upper limit given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mh ] ) is realistic and robust .",
    "our approximations break down when the halo only contains a few vmos ; at least @xmath48 objects within a radius of @xmath148 pc are required , implying that our analysis is restricted to masses @xmath149 m@xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : massfraction ] , the observational limits on vmos over a wide range of masses and dark matter fractions are shown .",
    "the analysis of the survival of fornax s gcs rules out the mass range that would be interesting for explaining the origin of dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies ( k03 ; @xcite ) , because the relaxation timescale for vmos of mass @xmath150 m@xmath1 exceeds the hubble time .",
    "moreover , it was found that the integrity of cold small - scale clustering seen in some dsphs imposes more stringent constraints on the mass of vmos .",
    "a source of uncertainty is the mean density of dark matter within the core of dsphs . in the particular case of umi and",
    "according to the scaling relations compiled in @xcite , the corresponding central dark matter density is @xmath2 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 .",
    "a slightly larger value has been derived from its internal dynamics @xcite . at a density @xmath151",
    "m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mh ] ) implies that @xmath152 m@xmath1 .",
    "we strongly encourage better determinations of the velocity dispersion of cold density aggregates ( bound or unbound ) in dsphs . for instance",
    ", if the preliminary quoted value of @xmath7 km / s for the secondary peak of umi were confirmed , our upper limit for @xmath15 would be immediately reduced by a factor of @xmath153 , implying a very tight bound @xmath154@xmath155 m@xmath1 , depending on the adopted dark matter density ( @xmath156 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 to @xmath157 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 ) .    in a unified scheme such as the ` stirring scenario ' by @xcite",
    ", the composition of the dark halos of low - surface brightness and dsph galaxies should be the same .",
    "@xcite found an upper limit of @xmath27 m@xmath1 by examining the dynamical heating of the stellar disk of gr 8 .",
    "@xcite warn about the weakness of the argument of @xcite because the rotation curve of gr 8 decays in a keplerian fashion suggesting that gr 8 does not host a halo of dark matter , as expected if the dark halo has evaporated by two - body collisions . however , there exist dwarf galaxies with flat rotation curves . from the sample of @xcite , we have selected dwarf galaxies with high inclination angles and estimated the maximum permitted value of @xmath15 consistent with the thickness of the old stellar disk .",
    "perhaps one of the most pristine cases is the edge - on galaxy ugca 442 .",
    "this galaxy shows the typical flat rotation curve , implying the existence of a halo of dark matter with a central density of @xmath158 m@xmath1 pc@xmath3 and a velocity dispersion @xmath159 km / s @xcite .",
