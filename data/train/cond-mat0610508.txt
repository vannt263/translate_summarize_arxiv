    "the effect of a superconducting contact on the conductance of a metal is qualitatively different if the electrons propagate ballistically or diffusively through the metal : a superconducting contact doubles the conductance of a ballistic metal , while the conductance of a diffusive metal remains the same .",
    "@xcite the conductance doubling in a ballistic metal happens because an electron incident on the superconductor is andreev reflected as a hole of opposite charge , hence doubling the current .",
    "the effective length @xmath1 of the conductor is doubled as well , because the hole has to make its way back , and this effect cancels the conductance doubling in the case of a diffusive metal .",
    "these two competing effects are summarized by the approximate relation @xmath5 between the conductance @xmath3 of a normal - metal  superconductor junction and its normal - state value @xmath4 . as derived in ref .   from a generalized landauer formula , the relation ( [ simple ] )",
    "holds if quantum corrections of order @xmath6 can be neglected .",
    "it also requires an ideal ns interface , without a mismatch of fermi wave lengths between n and s.    a novel transport regime called `` pseudo - diffusive '' appears in an impurity - free carbon monolayer (= graphene ) at zero carrier concentration (= dirac point ) .",
    "because of the vanishing density of states the transmission through a strip of undoped graphene ( width @xmath7 , length @xmath1 ) occurs entirely via evanescent modes . for a short and wide strip there is a large number @xmath8 of evanescent modes with transmission probability of order unity ( open channels ) .",
    "several recent investigations have found that the transport properties of undoped ballistic graphene are similar to those of a diffusive metal with the same number @xmath9 of open channels : both systems have the same conductance@xcite @xmath10 and the same shot noise power@xcite ( fano factor @xmath11 ) . in a josephson junction",
    "both systems have the same current - phase relationship , critical current , and current - voltage characteristic.@xcite this correspondence between evanescent modes in graphene and diffusion modes in a disordered metal is not limited to a carbon monolayer , but applies to a bilayer as well.@xcite the effect of disorder on the evanescent modes has also been studied.@xcite    in this paper we present one more manifestation of pseudo - diffusion in graphene , by calculating the ratio @xmath12 .",
    "far from the dirac point , at high carrier concentrations , this ratio is between 1 and 2  as expected for a ballistic metal with a fermi wave length mismatch . at the dirac point , however , the ratio approaches unity  as in a diffusive metal , but without any scattering by impurities or lattice defects .",
