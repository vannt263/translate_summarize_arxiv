    "in physical problems involving several distinct scales , it is often convenient to describe the physics using an effective field theory .",
    "typically , one is interested in physics at energies much less than the mass of a heavy particle , in which case the physics is most easily described by an effective lagrangian in which virtual heavy particle exchange is accounted for through a series of non - renormalizable operators .",
    "the coefficients of these operators are perturbatively calculable as a power series in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the heavy particle which is integrated out . however , since the resulting perturbation series is only asymptotic , and since it is well known that perturbative qcd is not borel - summable , the perturbatively calculated coefficient functions are at some level ambiguous .",
    "one source of this ambiguity is infrared renormalons@xcite , which arise in qcd from graphs of the form shown in fig .",
    "1 . they contribute to the factorial growth of the coefficients of the perturbation series , and introduce uncertainties in the sum of the perturbation series proportional to powers of @xmath4 .",
    "there has been much recent discussion in the literature on the effects of infrared renormalons in the context of one particular effective field theory , the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite . in particular , the use of the pole mass as an expansion parameter in hqet has been criticized , because it has been shown to suffer from an ambiguity which prevents its definition to an accuracy better than @xmath5 @xcite , and the authors of ref .",

    "given this ambiguity , it is important to show that physical predictions of hqet , which are usually expressed using the pole mass as an expansion parameter , are unambiguous . in this paper , we investigate the effects of renormalons on matching conditions in effective field theories .",
    "we argue that , while perturbatively calculated coefficient functions suffer from renormalons , any ambiguity in a physical observable is always higher order in @xmath0 than the theory has been defined and is consequently irrelevant . therefore , as long as one works consistently",
    ", it does not matter that unobservable parameters such as the heavy quark mass or the matrix elements of higher dimension operators are not unambiguously defined ; relations between physical quantities are unambiguous .",
    "we also argue that , while formulating hqet in terms of some short - distance mass @xmath6 is certainly possible , use of an expansion parameter other than the pole mass ( or some mass which differs from @xmath8 by @xmath9 ) is both inconvenient and uneccessary .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section  2 , we review the physics of infrared renormalons , and discuss the basic method of calculation that will be used in this paper . in section  3 we discuss hqet and the renormalon ambiguity in the quark pole mass .",
    "we show explicitly that there are no renormalons in the ratio of form factors for @xmath10 semileptonic decay from which the perturbatively defined pole mass may be extracted , and we comment on the renormalon cancellation for inclusive semileptonic @xmath11 meson decay . in section  4",
    ", we discuss renormalon ambiguities in a four - fermi effective theory .",

    "however , this ambiguity is completely spurious , and does _ not _ mean that the effective field theory is not well defined . since the theory has only been defined to a fixed order , an ambiguity at higher order in @xmath52 is irrelevant .",

    "the hqet mass when @xmath70 is often referred to in the literature as the pole mass , and we will follow this practice here .    like all effective lagrangians , the hqet lagrangian is non - renormalizable , so a specific regularization prescription must be included as part of the definition of the effective theory . an effective field theory is used to compute physical quantities in a systematic expansion in a small parameter , and the effective lagrangian is expanded in this small parameter .",
    "the expansion parameter of the hqet is @xmath71 .",
    "one can then use `` power counting '' to determine what terms in the effective theory are relevant to a given order in the @xmath72 expansion .",

    "it is important that the renormalization procedure preserve the the power counting for the effective field theory to make sense . in order to preserve power counting",

    "it has recently been shown @xcite that there is a renormalon in the relation between the renormalized mass at short distances ( such as the @xmath43 mass @xmath75 ) and the pole mass of the heavy quark at @xmath76 , which produces an ambiguity in the relation between the pole mass and the @xmath43 mass of order @xmath77 .",

    "the @xmath43 mass at short distances is useful in computing high - energy processes .",
    "however , there is no advantage to using the `` short distance '' mass ( such as the running @xmath43 mass ) in hqet , as advocated by @xcite .",

    "when @xmath66 is chosen to be the @xmath43 mass the residual mass term @xmath67 is of order @xmath66 ( up to logarithms ) , which spoils the @xmath72 power counting of hqet , mixes the @xmath13 and @xmath72 expansions , and breaks the heavy flavor symmetry .",
    "for example , using @xmath66 to be the @xmath43 mass at @xmath79 , one finds at one loop that @xmath80 in @xmath81 decays , including this residual mass term in the heavy @xmath82-quark lagrangian , causes @xmath83 operators such as @xmath84 to produce effects that are of the same order in @xmath83 as lower dimension operators of the form @xmath85 .",
    "while physical quantities calculated in this way must be the same as those calculated using the pole mass , it unnecessarily complicates calculations to use a definition for @xmath66 that leaves a residual mass term that is not finite in the @xmath86 limit .",
