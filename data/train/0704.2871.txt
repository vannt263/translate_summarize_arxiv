    "in this article we establish and study the link between the three following subjects :    * characterization of complex or @xmath0 manifolds and holomorphic or @xmath0 functions by vanishing moments on families of closed curves . * global properties of smooth families of analytic discs attached to real submanifolds of complex manifolds . * a version of the generalized argument principle for smooth families of holomorphic mappings ( parametric argument principle ) .",
    "albeit the third subject seems to be of special and independent interest , in this publication we view it rather as the main tool , while the first two subjects will be in the main focus .    _ motivation .",
    "_ this article develops the ideas of the articles @xcite and @xcite of the author .",
    "there , the following two question about holomorphic functions and their boundary values were answered in real analytic category .",
    "we discuss these two question in more details in the next sections , hence in this introductory section we will touch on them briefly .",
    "the first question , called `` strip - problem '' , ( see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) , asks whether a function of one complex variable is analytic if it extends as analytic function from one - parameter family of jordan curves ?",
    "the condition of analytic extendibility from the curves can be formulated as condition of vanishing of all complex moments hence the question is about a version of morera theorem .",
    "the second question , globevnik - stout conjecture , or , more generally , boundary morera problem , ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is : if a function on the boundary of a domain in @xmath1 , or more generally , on a @xmath0-manifold , is the boundary value of a holomorphic function ( is @xmath0-function , i.e. satisfies the boundary @xmath2-equation ) if it extends holomorphically ( satisfies zero moment condition ) from a family of closed curves which are boundaries of analytic discs in @xmath1 ? ( such analytic discs are called attached . ) the globevnik - stout conjecture , which generalizes an earlier result for the complex ball , due to nagel and rudin , is a special case of the boundary morera problem when the attached analytic discs are obtained by complex linear sections .    in this article",
    ", we generalize the results of @xcite , @xcite and obtain new results in this direction by looking at the problems in a more general context .",
    "the scheme is as follows .",
    "the first step is based on the simple idea that properties of functions often can be reworded as those of surfaces , if one passes from functions to their graphs .",
    "in particular , the question whether a function is holomorphic translates as whether its graph is a complex manifold , i.e. the tangent spaces are complex linear subspaces in @xmath1 ?",
    "correspondingly , asking whether a function is @xmath3 function is equivalent to asking whether its graph has the dimension of complex tangent spaces ( @xmath0-dimension ) not less than the @xmath0-dimension of the manifold where the function is originally defined .",
    "taking into account that the graphs of the analytic extensions into attached analytic discs , are themselves analytic discs , attached to the graph of our function , we immediately arrive to a general problem of estimating @xmath0-dimension of real manifolds in @xmath1 in terms of families of attached analytic discs .",
    "information about @xmath0-dimension is important in many problems , for instance , in the problem of characterization of boundaries of complex varieties ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which we also consider in this article .",
    "_ step 2 . from manifolds to mappings .",
    "_ observe that the @xmath0-dimension of a real manifold at its point can be `` measured '' by the dimension of the @xmath4-linear span of the tangent space at this point : the more is @xmath0-dimension , the less is the dimension of the span .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-dimension is a \" ` measure \" of linear dependence of the tangent space over @xmath4 , i.e. measure of the degeneracy of our real manifold over @xmath4 .",
    "now , assume that our real manifold is covered by the boundaries of analytic discs constituting a smooth family parametrized by point in a real manifold of parameters .",
    "each analytic disc in this family is a holomorphic image of the standard complex unit disc and hence we deal with a smooth family of holomorphic mappings of the unit disc into @xmath1 .",
    "this smooth family of holomorphic mappings can be regarded as a single mapping holomorphically depending on one complex variable in the unit disc and smoothly - on the rest of the real variables ( the parameters of the family ) .",
    "our manifold is covered by the images of the unit circles , therefore it can be viewed as the image , under the above mapping , of the cartesian product of two manifolds : the unit circle and the manifold of parameters .",
    "thus , according to the earlier remark , the @xmath0-dimension of our real manifold is related to the @xmath4-degeneracy of the tangent spaces , which in turn is related to the rank of the above partially holomorphic mapping .",
    "parametric argument principle .",
    "_ thus , we have linked the question of estimating of @xmath0-dimension of a real manifold , equipped by attached analytic discs , with the question about degeneracy , in the sense of the rank , of a certain mapping .",
    "the third step relates the latter question with a generalized argument principle for holomorphic mappings .",
    "this relation is the key ingredient of our considerations and requires more detailed explanation .",
    "in fact , what we mean is the following corollary ( a weak version ) of the argument principle : if a holomorphic mapping of the closed unit disc into @xmath1 maps the unit circle into a homologically trivial loop then the mapping is constant ( has rank zero ) .",
    "indeed , otherwise the image of the unit disc is a 1-dimensional complex variety and hence has the positive intersection index with any other complex variety of the complementary dimension , intersecting the image of the unit disc but disjoint from the image its boundary .",
    "however , this contradicts to the general form of the argument principle .",
    "indeed , it says that the above intersection index equals to the linking coefficient between the complementary variety and the loop - the image of the unit circle .",
    "but this loop is homologically trivial and therefore the linking coefficient , and hence the interesection index , must 0 , which is the contradiction .    in our situation",
    "we deal with a family ( manifold ) of holomorphic mappings rather than with a single mapping .",
    "this manifold of mappings can be regarded also as as a single mapping but defined on the cartesian product of the unit disc and the manifold of parameters .",
    "the mapping depends holomorphically on the first , complex , variable in the unit disc , and smoothly - on the rest of the ( real ) variables - parameters .",
    "our key result is a generalization of the above version of the argument principle , from a single mapping to families of those , by proving the following fact .",
    "suppose that the above mapping is homologically trivial on the boundary which is the cartesian product of the circle and of the parameterizing manifold .",
    "suppose that , however , the trajectory of a fixed point in the unit disc , when the parameters run the parameterizing manifold , sweeps up a cycle which is not homological to 0 in the entire image .",
    "then the entire mapping degenerates in the sense of its rank .",
    "in particular , the dimension of the image falls down .    in less formal terms , the result says the following : if a smooth parametric family of holomorphic mappings of the unit disc into @xmath1 collapses on the unit circle , meaning that the images of the unit circle sweep up a variety with trivial highest homologies , but this homological degeneracy comes not from the parameters , then the entire family of mappings degenerates in the sense of the rank . in this case",
    "the images of the unit disc sweep up a variety of the dimension less than maximally possible .",
    "notice that the ordinary argument principle corresponds to the parameterizing manifold consisting of a single point .",
    "this result , in view of the above reduction , implies estimating of @xmath0-dimensions and , correspondingly , leads to solution of the above mentioned related problems .",
    "let @xmath5 be a real submanifold of a complex stein manifold @xmath6 of the complex dimension @xmath7 @xmath0-structure on @xmath5 is defined by the maximal complex subspaces of the tangent space of @xmath5 .",
    "the manifold @xmath5 is @xmath0 is the dimension of complex tangent subspaces is the same at all points and this dimensiond is called @xmath0-dimension .",
    "@xmath0-functions on a @xmath0-manifold are smooth functions satisfying the tangential @xmath0-equations in the complex tangent spaces . for continuous functions , the @xmath0-conditions can be formulated in a weak sense , in terms of orthogonality to @xmath2-closed forms .",
    "if @xmath5 is a complex submanifold then @xmath0-functions are the same as holomorphic functions . by bochner - severi theorem @xmath0-functions on the boundary of a domain in @xmath1",
    "coincide with the boundary values of holomorphic functions in this domain .",
    "analytic disc @xmath8 in @xmath9 is the image of the closed unit complex disc @xmath10 under holomorphic immersion @xmath11 the disc is attached to a real manifold @xmath5 if @xmath12 analytic discs are very powerful tool for study @xmath0-manifolds , and the literature on this subject is very large .    the main problem",
    ", we study in this article , can be formulated as follows :    * problem . *",
    "_ given a real submanifold of a complex manifold , equipped by a family of attached analytic discs , derive lower bound for its @xmath0-dimension .",
    "_    let us discuss this problem in more details .",
    "first of all , when the manifold is the graph of a function , then the question turns to a characterization of @xmath0-functions . if @xmath13 then both the manifold and the attached analytic discs lie in the same complex plane and we arrive to the problem of characterization of holomorphic functions in terms of analytic extensions from closed curves .",
    "when the manifold is a boundary of a domain in @xmath1 then we deal with the morera type problem of characterization of boundary values of holomorphic functions .    in the authors s articles",
    "@xcite,@xcite such characterization were obtained under assumption of real analyticity and , in particular , two open questions , the strip - problem and globevnik - stout conjecture , were answered in real analytic category .",
    "these problems , which we have mentioned already in introduction , concern characterization of holomorphic functions in planar domains and boundary values of holomorphic functions in domains in @xmath1 ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the case when the manifold @xmath5 is the graph of a function @xmath14 is of special interest . if @xmath14 analytically extends to an attached analytic disc , then the graph of the extension is an analytic disc attached to the graph of @xmath14 .",
    "further , the function @xmath14 is holomorphic or @xmath0 means that its graph is a complex or @xmath0-manifold .",
    "therefore , if one passes from the language of functions to the language of the manifold , then one is led to a problem of determining the @xmath0-dimension of a real manifold admitting families of attached analytic discs with certain properties .",
    "let us make another important remark .",
    "the minimal number of parameters of a family @xmath15 of curves covering a manifold @xmath5 is @xmath16 if one is allowed to shrink analytic discs to a point then their tangent complex vectors converge to a tangent complex vector in the tangent space of the manifold at the limit point . having at hands rich enough family of discs one can induce complex tangent spaces of arbitrary possible dimension .",
    "however , to induce a tangent complex line , by the above limit process , one needs at least @xmath17-parametric family of attached discs . on the contrary",
    ", we use the families containing no infinitesimally small discs .",
    "this circumstance makes the problem much more difficult .",
    "our basic result is theorem 2 describing families of attached analytic discs which enforces the @xmath0-dimension to be positive .",
    "this result makes sense for @xmath18 since otherwise the @xmath0-dimension is automatically positive . for the range of the dimension @xmath19",
    ", we describe those families @xmath15 of attached analytic discs depending on minimally possible number of parameters :    @xmath20    which imply existing of complex lines in the tangent spaces .",
    "then we apply this result to the case of general dimensions @xmath19 and of arbitrary @xmath0-dimensions .      the existence of families , even large ones , of attached analytic discs does not guarantee nontrivial @xmath0-structure , induced by the ambient complex manifold .",
    "here is a simple example .",
    "define the 2-dimensional manifold in @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given positive numbers .",
    "the analytic disc @xmath25 is attached to @xmath5 because @xmath26 these analytic discs constitute the 1-parameter smooth family . nevertheless , the manifold @xmath5 is totally real , i.e. has zero @xmath27-dimension .",
    "in fact , the manifold @xmath5 , which geometrically is a truncated cone ( see fig.1 , on the left ) , is the graph of the function @xmath28 over the annulus @xmath29 in @xmath4 and the trivial observation is that @xmath28 extends analytically from any circle @xmath30 but is not analytic .",
    "the analytic discs attached to @xmath5 are obtained by by parallel sections @xmath31 of the solid 3-dimensional cone @xmath32    moreover , even essentially larger families analytic discs may not detect complex structure .",
    "for instance , it was observed in @xcite that the function @xmath33 extends analytically inside any circle surrounding 0 .",
    "these circles constitute 3-parameter family .",
    "nevertheless the function @xmath14 is not analytic .",
    "the geometric interpretation is as follows .",
    "the graph @xmath34 of the function @xmath35 admits 3-parameter family of attached analytic discs - the graphs of the corresponding analytic extensions .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath5 is not a complex manifold , the opposite , it is totally real .    let us give more examples to illustrate the main problem and the main result of the article .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "* consider the 2-dimensional torus @xmath36 in @xmath21 realized as the shilov boundary of the bidisc @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the unit disc in the complex plane , i.e. @xmath39 . the 2-dimensional manifold @xmath40 admits 1-parameter family @xmath41 of attached analytic discs but is totally real , @xmath42    * example 2 .",
    "* let @xmath5 be an embedded 2-dimensional annulus @xmath43 and let @xmath44 where @xmath45    thus , @xmath5 is just the graph of the function @xmath46 over the annulus , and @xmath47 are the graphs of discs inscribed in the annulus . as in example 1 , the 1-parameter family of analytic discs @xmath47 is parametrized by points @xmath48 , and each analytic disc @xmath47 is attached ( in fact , belongs ) to @xmath5 .",
    "the manifold @xmath5 is complex , i.e. @xmath49 it is illustrated on fig.1 , on the right .    in the next two examples the manifolds are 3-dimensional .",
    "* example 3 .",
    "* consider the 3-manifold in @xmath50 : @xmath51 this manifold admits 3-parameter family of attached analytic discs @xmath47 , parametrized by the points @xmath52 namely : @xmath53 where @xmath54    the manifold @xmath5 is the graph of the function @xmath55 over the unit sphere @xmath56 in @xmath21 .",
    "this function is constant on the sections of @xmath56 by 1-dimensional complex linear subspaces and corresponding attached analytic discs @xmath47 are just the graphs of the constant extensions into those linear sections .",
    "@xmath5 is totally real , @xmath57 at each point except the circle @xmath58    * example 4 .",
    "* define 3-manifold in @xmath50 by @xmath59 take @xmath60 and let @xmath61 be the ( unique ) complex line tangent to the 3-sphere @xmath62 at the point @xmath63 define @xmath64 then @xmath65 is a 3-parametric family of analytic discs attached to @xmath66 the manifold @xmath5 is the graph of the function @xmath67 over @xmath68 the analytic discs @xmath47 are graphs of @xmath67 over the sections of the unit ball in @xmath21 by complex lines tangent to the sphere @xmath69 the manifold @xmath5 is maximally complex , @xmath70    let us briefly analyse the examples .",
    "first , notice that in all of them the manifold @xmath5 and the families of the attached discs are real - analytic .",
    "in examples 1 and 3 the manifolds are totally real , while in examples 2 and 4 the @xmath0-dimensions are positive .",
    "now , let us examine the dimensions .",
    "in example 1 and example 2 the dimension of manifolds @xmath5 is @xmath71 and the dimension of the family of discs is @xmath72 .",
    "the boundaries of the attached discs are 1-dimensional curves and the families of these curves depend on one real parameter .",
    "the curves cover 2-dimensional manifolds and therefore no dimensional degeneracy happens in both examples .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath5 in example 1 is totally real while in example 2 it is a complex manifold .",
    "however , an important observation is that , albeit in both examples 1 and 2 the families of the discs are parametrized by the same closed manifold @xmath73 in example 1 the manifold @xmath5 is closed while in example 2 it is not . in particular , the _ brouwer degree _ of the mapping @xmath74 which parametrizes the family of the boundaries @xmath75 equals @xmath76 in example 1 ( @xmath77 is identical mapping in this case ) and equals @xmath78 in example 2 , because the topological degree of mappings from closed compact manifold to compact manifold with nonempty boundary is 0 .    now turn to examples 3 and 4 . here in both cases",
    "the manifold of parameters is 3-dimensional sphere @xmath68 the dimension of the manifolds @xmath5 is in both cases @xmath79 and the dimension of the families is @xmath80 contrary to examples 1 and 2 , here we face dimensional degeneracy because @xmath81 however , the results again are different : in example 3 @xmath5 is totally real ( except the circle @xmath82 ) , while in example 4 @xmath5 is maximally complex ( the @xmath0-dimension equals 1 ) .",
    "hence , there must be other reasons , besides degeneracy , which affect on @xmath0-dimensions .    to understand the crucial difference between examples 3 and 4 , let us us look at them from the topological point of view .",
    "observe that in example 3 the projections of the discs @xmath47 on the plane @xmath83 are all complex lines through 0 and their union coincides with the unit ball in @xmath84 therefore , the discs @xmath47 sweep up in @xmath50 a 5-manifold @xmath85 which is contractible and therefore topologically trivial .",
    "in particular , the centers of the discs @xmath47 fill the segment @xmath86,$ ] representing a topologically trivial loop .",
    "the opposite , in example 4 , the projections of the discs on @xmath21 are complex lines tangent to the sphere of radius @xmath87 the 4-dimensional manifold @xmath88 in this example is noncontractible , as it contains a hole corresponding the ball @xmath89 moreover , the centers of the discs @xmath47 form a 3-cycle which bounds no 4-cycle in @xmath90 , because this 3-cycle surrounds the 4-dimensional hole .",
    "[ fig : cones ]      thus , we observe in the above four examples that the manifold @xmath5 carries no complex structure in the cases when the family of the attached discs is either homologically nontrivial but non - degenerate on @xmath5 ( example 1 ) , or degenerate on @xmath5 but homologically trivial ( example 3 ) .",
    "remind , that by degeneracy on @xmath5 we understand any of the two following situations .",
    "the first one is the dimensional degeneracy , when @xmath91 , as in examples 3 and 4 , where @xmath92 is number of parameters of the family .",
    "the second type is when @xmath93 but the brouwer degree is @xmath94 , as in example 2 .",
    "both types of degeneracy are unified by saying that the @xmath95-th homology group of @xmath5 vanishes .",
    "on the other hand , in example 2 and example 4 , where the manifolds @xmath5 has positive @xmath0-dimension , the families of attached analytic discs are both _ degenerate and homologically nontrivial_.    it appears that just the last two properties are crucial and the main result of this article , theorem 2 , says that families of attached discs , possessing these two properties , do induce @xmath0-structure .",
    "the dimension of this structure depends on the size and the structure of the family of the attached analytic discs .",
    "one should mention that the phenomenon is essentially global , as the property of homological nontriviality is a global property ( though , the condition of degeneracy is obviously local ) .",
    "moreover , examples show that one can not expect local characterizations of the considered type .",
    "the results on attached analytic discs rest on theorem 1 which is the key theorem in the article .",
    "theorem 1 can be interpreted as a * parametric argument principle*.    this relation was mentioned in introduction , but let us explain it now in a more detailed way . the argument principle for complex manifolds",
    "can be understood as follows : if @xmath96 are two transversally intersecting bordered complex submanifolds in a complex manifold @xmath97 then then the linking number of the boundaries equals to the number of the intersection points : @xmath98 counting multiplicities .",
    "this reflects the fact that the intersection index of two complex varieties is nonnegative .",
    "in particular , if @xmath99 is a nondegenerate holomorphic mapping of the unit complex disc to a complex manifold , smooth up to the boundary , then the linking number of the curve @xmath100 and the boundary of any disjoint from @xmath101 complex variety is nonnegative .",
    "( alexander and wermer proved in @xcite that this condition is also necessary for @xmath101 to bound a 1-dimensional complex manifold or chain . )    therefore , if @xmath101 is homologically trivial , i.e. @xmath102 so that all the above linking numbers are @xmath103 then no complex chain is bounded by @xmath101 and hence @xmath104 degenerates : @xmath105 this fact can be regarded as a weak version of the argument principle for holomorphic mappings .    now , suppose that , instead of a single mapping , we have a smooth parametric family @xmath106 of analytic mappings from @xmath38 to @xmath1 , parametrized by points @xmath107 from a real manifold @xmath108 such objects naturally appear as parameterizations of smooth families of attached analytic discs .",
    "theorem 1 generalizes the above degeneracy phenomenon , from the case of single analytic mapping , @xmath109 , to multi - parametric families , @xmath110 .    loosely speaking , the collapse ( homological triviality ) of the union @xmath111 of the images of the unit circle may have two sources : the dependence on the parameters @xmath107 and/or the holomorphic dependence on the complex variable @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , to expect the generalization of the above weak form of the argument principle , one has to exclude the possible affect of the real parameters @xmath107 .",
    "the condition of _ homological nontriviality in @xmath107 _ of the family just serves this purpose .",
    "namely , the condition requires that for some ( and then for any ) fixed @xmath113 the mapping @xmath114 maps @xmath115 to a nontrivial cycle in the union of the images , @xmath116    it turns out that in this situation collapse of the boundary can be caused only by dimensional degeneracy of the mapping @xmath117 more precisely , our key result , theorem 1 , claims that _ if the family @xmath118 of analytic mappings of the unit disc , homologically degenerates on the boundary , @xmath119 , and is homologically nontrivial in @xmath120 , then it degenerates , in the sense of rank , in the solid manifold @xmath121 _    theorem 1 , applied to the parameterizing mappings of the families of attached analytic discs , delivers the needed information about @xmath0-dimension of the target manifold because the degeneracy which claims theorem 1 implies nonzero complex tangent spaces in the target manifold @xmath122      the article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to theorems for manifolds .",
    "all objects , manifolds and families of the analytic discs are assumed real - analytic .",
    "all theorems in section 2 are derived from theorem 1 which is the basic fact behind all the results of this article .",
    "theorem 1 , which we prove in section 4 , says that if a @xmath0-mapping from a cartesian product @xmath123 where is the unit complex disc @xmath38 and @xmath115 is a real compact manifold , degenerates on the boundary @xmath119 and is homologically nontrivial then the degeneracy propagates inside the cartesian product .",
    "theorem 1 generalizes , from a single analytic function to parametric families of analytic functions , the following corollary of the argument principle : if an analytic function in the unit disc , smooth up to its closure , degenerates on the boundary ( i.e. , either maps it to a point , or has degree 0 ) then it is constant .",
    "theorem 2 presents a geometric version of theorem 1 and says that if @xmath18 then real @xmath19-manifold in @xmath124-dimensional complex space everywhere the positive @xmath0-dimension ( i.e. , is nowhere totally real ) if it admits a degenerate homologically nontrivial family of attached analytic discs .",
    "corollary [ c : morera_curves ] is a partial of theorem 2 for @xmath125 it gives a characterization of complex curves in @xmath21 as a real 2-manifolds admitting nontrivial families of attached analytic discs .",
    "theorem 2 stops working when @xmath126 indeed the @xmath0-dimension is always at least @xmath127 and therefore it is automatically positive when @xmath128 .",
    "that is why we prove theorem 3 which extends theorem 2 for the range @xmath129 in an effecitve way .",
    "namely , theorem 3 derives , from the existence of certain families of attached analytic discs , the lower bound @xmath130 which is , of course , nontrivial for @xmath131    theorem 4 is a special case of theorem 3 , for the case @xmath132 .",
    "it describes maximally complex manifolds , which , due to known results of wermer @xcite , harvey and lawson @xcite are exactly boundaries of complex @xmath133-chains .",
    "therefore , theorem 4 characterizes those real manifolds which are boundaries of complex manifolds , in terms of attached analytic discs .",
    "results of this type , for the case of analytic discs , obtained by complex linear sections , are earlier obtained by dolbeault and henkin @xcite , @xcite and t .- c .",
    "dinh @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "section 3 is devoted to characterization of @xmath27r - functions on @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "the obtained results are just special cases of corresponding theorems from section 2 , when the manifolds under consideration are graphs of functions .",
    "we give characterizations @xmath0-functions and boundary values of holomorphic functions , in terms of analytic extension in families of attached analytic disc ( one - dimensional extension property ) .",
    "in particular , these results contain solutions of the strip - problem and of globevnik - stout conjecture , for real - analytic functions ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "similar characterization of @xmath0-functions were obtained by tumanov in @xcite .",
    "albeit , in @xcite pretty special families of attached discs ( thin discs ) were exploited .    in section 4",
    "we prove theorem 1 which serves the base for all other results .",
    "we present two versions of the proof .",
    "the first one works for the general case , while the second one - for closed families of discs .",
    "both proofs exploit the duality between homologies and cohomologies , but the first proof uses poincare duality and intersection indices and is more geometric , while the second one uses de rham duality and integrals of differential forms , computing linking numbers , and is more analytic .",
    "both versions of the proof develop the ideas and constructions from the earlier articles @xcite , @xcite of the author .",
    "however , here we not only generalize results from @xcite and @xcite to higher dimensions , and from @xmath0-functions to @xmath0-manifolds , but we also modify the approach . in particular , we tried to expose the constructions and the arguments , as much as possible , in a coordinate free form .",
    "as we have mentioned , theorem 1 is our key tool for estimation @xmath0-dimensions by means of attached analytic discs . in the concluding section",
    "we discuss the generalization of theorem 1 to a version of argument principle for @xmath0-manifolds and @xmath0-mappings .",
    "in the notations for manifolds , we will use upper index for the dimensions . for real manifolds it will mean the real dimension , and and for complex manifolds - the complex one .",
    "however , sometimes we will be omitting this index .",
    "let @xmath6 be a complex stein manifold of the complex dimension @xmath7 for simplicity we assume @xmath9 realized as a submanifold of the euclidean space , @xmath134 let @xmath135 be a real smooth @xmath136dimensional submanifold , maybe with the boundary .    for each point @xmath137",

    "now , the stokes formula for the currents yields @xmath697 it remains to prove that the first integral in the last expression is 0 . since the forms",
    "@xmath698 and @xmath699 define the same currents , the integral that we are interested in equals to @xmath700 using the representation ( [ e : jacob ] ) for @xmath640 from lemma [ l : jacob ] , we obtain that the differential form under the sign of the integral represents as @xmath701    suppose that we are in the situation of theorem 1 , that is @xmath702 then the degree of the form @xmath255 is @xmath236 and therefore @xmath703 since the dimension of the manifold @xmath704 is less than the degree @xmath705 of the form , the restriction of the form is zero : @xmath706 and then the form @xmath707 and the integral @xmath708    now suppose that the case b ) take place , i.e. @xmath237 and @xmath78 on @xmath238    in this case the integral @xmath709 in ( [ e:9 ] ) is zero by the different reason , namely , because the brouwer degree of the mapping @xmath710 of two @xmath19-dimensional mappings is zero .",
    "indeed , from formula ( [ e:4 ] ) we have @xmath711 because @xmath201 lemma is proved .",
    "the final part of the proof is as follows . by the condition the image @xmath223 of the fundamental cycle is homologically nontrivial in @xmath712    by de rham duality there exists a closed nonexact @xmath92-form @xmath255 in a neighborhood of @xmath713 such that @xmath714 as above , the cycle of integration consists of 2 parts : @xmath715 the first part is a cycle cooriented with @xmath223 because @xmath485 is holomorphic in @xmath716 the second part @xmath670 is negligible because is represents the zero homology class .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath717    this contradiction with lemma [ l : stokes ] shows that the assumption that @xmath553 is not identically zero is not true and this completes the proof , due to lemma [ l : jacob ] and the definition of the jacobian @xmath553 in section [ s : jacobians ]",
    "in theorem 1 , we consider the @xmath617-dimensional manifold @xmath718 which carries a natural @xmath0- structure .",
    "essentially , what we prove in theorem 1 is that if a @xmath0-mapping @xmath77 is not degenerate ( has the maximal rank ) on @xmath491 and if @xmath77 induces nontrivial homomorphism of the homology groups @xmath719 to the group @xmath720 ( i.e. @xmath77 is homologically nontrivial ) , then for the image of the boundary @xmath721 we have @xmath722    theorem 1 deals with @xmath0-manifolds of the simple form , namely with those manifolds which are the direct products @xmath723 of the unit disc and a real manifold of parameters .",
    "we think that it can be generalized to more general @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "the expected theorem would state that , under certain conditions , nondegenerate @xmath0-mapping @xmath77 of a bordered @xmath0-manifold can not be homologically trivial on the boundary .    according to our discussion in introduction , the expected result , translated to the language of the @xmath77-images , would lead to a generalization of the weak form of the argument principle .",
    "this generalization would claim that the boundary of a nontrivial , in a certain sense , @xmath0-manifold can not be homologically trivial .    moreover , we conjecture that a strong , quantitative , version of the argument principle for @xmath0-mappings and @xmath0-manifolds might be realized .",
    "if in the case of complex manifolds , the argument principle can be interpreted as the equality between the linking number of the boundary of a complex manifold with respect to another complex manifolds , on one hand , and the number of the intersection points of the two complex manifolds , on the other hand , then in more general case of @xmath0-manifolds , one may expect a combined relation . in this conjectured relation ,",
    "the complex and real counterparts of the manifold , coming correspondingly from complex and totally real tangent bundles , would contribute in a different way .",
    "such generalization is supposed to be the subject of a future publication .",
