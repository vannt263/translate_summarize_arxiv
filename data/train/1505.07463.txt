    "the field of radial velocity ( rv ) extrasolar planet detection is poised on the discovery of the first true earth analog , having so far been denied by the exquisite levels of doppler precision needed to detect such a planet .",
    "the expectedrv amplitude of an earth - size planet orbiting in the habitable - zone of a sun - like star is @xmath110  cm  s@xmath3 , far below the precision achievable with the current generation of dedicated doppler spectrographs . attaining this precision goal will require , among other things , an unprecedented level of long - term instrument stability .",
    "one of the major technical challenges in improving the stability of these instruments is stabilizing the instrument illumination .",
    "conventional slit - fed spectrographs have instrument point - spread functions ( psf ) that vary significantly with seeing conditions and telescope guiding variability , thus limiting their ultimate rv precision .",
    "consequently , these instruments require specialized methods of simultaneous calibration and data reduction to retrospectively discern stellar rv signals from instrument illumination variations @xcite .",
    "optical fibers offer a convenient and efficient method of transporting light from telescopes , allowing instruments to be physically decoupled from the telescope focus . while the addition of a conventional circular fiber provides a significant improvement in instrument psf stability , the output of a typical astronomical fiber is still sensitive to the flux distribution incident on the fiber from the telescope . as this input illumination varies",
    "( e.g. due to guiding errors , seeing , or telescope pupil variations ) , the output intensity distribution also varies .",
    "this is particularly an issue for fiber - fed doppler rv instruments since any illumination variations in the fiber output directly manifest as changes in the instrument profile .",
    "this effect can not be calibrated with standard emission wavelength references that use a dedicated calibration fiber , since the output illumination is specific to the fiber and source and thus the calibration source does not accurately trace any variations in the stellar illumination propagating through the object fiber .",
    "in fact , the problem of spectrograph illumination is currently acknowledged to be one of the precision - limiting factors in doppler spectroscopy , along with scientific source stability and wavelength calibration @xcite .",
    "step - index multimode fibers have long been used as optical image scramblers to decouple the distribution of flux in the output beam from the illumination pattern at the telescope focal plane @xcite . in agreement with theory @xcite , repeated laboratory tests show that standard circular fibers yield a high degree of azimuthal scrambling , but minimal radial scrambling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in more recent years",
    ", fibers with non - circular cores have been tested to some degree and demonstrated significant improvement over standard circular core fibers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a single non - circular core fiber can not deliver the kind of homogeneity , in both near and far - field , required by spectrographs for high - precision rv measurements below the 1 m s@xmath3 level .",
    "these instruments require high levels of scrambling in both the near and far fields of the beam , without significantly compromising overall throughput .",
    "the fiber near - field , defined as the positional intensity distribution across the fiber face , is re - imaged in the spectrograph focal plane while the far - field is the angular distribution of the propagating beam .",
    "any variations in the near - field will manifest as psf variations , degrading overall instrument stability and measurement precision .",
    "the far - field pattern is projected onto the grating , and time - varying inhomogeneities that change groove illumination can introduce variable wavelength shifts at the detector .",
    "changes in the far field also affect the illumination of the camera and other spectrograph optics , and therefore can change the amount of abberations contributing to the psf shape , causing velocity shifts of spectral lines on the detector .",
    "any spurious profile changes in the spectra diminish rv precision , and hence stabilizing both the near - field and far - field of the fiber is key for precision doppler spectroscopy .",
    "a popular optical method of increasing the scrambling gain ( sg ) of a system is to introduce an optical double scrambler into the instrument fiber delivery system that exchanges the near and far fields by means of a lens relay @xcite .",
    "coupling octagonal fibers on either side of a double scrambler not only boosts the level of scrambling , but also stabilizes both the near and far field illumination patterns . the inclusion of even a single octagonal fiber with a double scrambler has been shown to significantly improve on - sky rv precision and instrument stability @xcite .    here",
    "we present a compact , easy - to - align double scrambler system based on a high refractive index ball lens .",
    "this device , when combined with octagonal fibers , yields sgs in excess of 10,000 .",
    "the measured efficiency of the scrambler assembly is 87% in the near - infrared ( nir ) , close to the theoretical maximum of the system in its current state ( with uncoated fiber faces ) .",
    "the addition of a circular fiber increases the sg of the system to @xmath220,000 .",
    "the prototype device used in the majority of testing uses all off - the - shelf components and takes advantage of existing high - tolerance components used in commercial telecommunications industries .",
    "our prototype scrambler is customized for the nir ( 0.82 - 1.3 @xmath4 m ) , but with careful selection of lens material , this design could easily be adapted to visible wavelengths ( 380 - 900 nm ) given the recent availability of broadband , high - index glasses from a variety of manufacturers .",
    "the simple design and minimal alignment requirements , when compared to classical double scramblers , implies that this device could easily be replicated for multiplexed fiber instruments on larger scales .",
    "our design of a high scrambling gain system is motivated by the requirements of the habitable zone planet finder ( hpf , * ? ? ? * ) , a stabilized fiber - fed precision rv spectrograph operating in the nir between 0.82 to 1.3 @xmath4 m , currently being built for the 10-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) . while scrambling is important for any high precision rv instrument , it is critical for an instrument on the het since the fixed - elevation telescope design yields a highly variable entrance pupil relative to other telescopes .",
    "stellar tracking is accomplished by moving a spherical aberration corrector ( sac ) and prime focus instrument package ( pfip ) over the primary spherical mirror .",
    "the actual telescope pupil is therefore defined by the geometric intersection of the sac , wide - field corrector ( wfc ) pupil , and the het primary , and both its orientation and shape change continuously during a track @xcite . without adequate",
    "scrambling , the changing pupil introduces large errors in the radial velocity measurements , and greatly undermines our primary science goals . during a set of observations",
    ", these pupil variations may average out over the track as a function of the target elevation and exposure time .",
    "nevertheless , we aim for maximal scrambling gains such that the spectrograph psf is desensitized to even the most extreme cases of input illumination change .",
    "it should be noted that , in the context of this paper , scrambling differs from fiber speckle noise , also called modal - noise , which is due to the time - dependent variation of the speckle pattern produced by the finite number traversing modes within a multi - mode fiber interfering at the fiber exit boundary @xcite . scrambling here refers only to the decorrelation of fiber output illumination from input variations ( or a re - arrangement of existing modes ) , and is a _ static _",
    "correction that does not account for the time variation of modal power and phase distribution between exposures caused by the changing internal geometry of light rays .",
    "proper modal noise mitigation requires a temporal redistribution of modes , commonly achieved through physical agitation of the fiber @xcite .",
    "this forces the light to populate different modes ( including unpopulated ones ) with a large distribution of phases , and reduces modal noise by varying the number and phase distribution of modes per exposure .    while poor scrambling changes the shape of the instrument profile and can shift its centroid ,",
    "the effect of modal noise is to introduce systematic _ uncertainty _ in the instrument profile over time .",
    "both are detrimental to high - precision rv measurements but are different phenomenon that do not have a single solution .",
    "we emphasize that unlike scrambling , modal noise mitigation requires a time variable correction that can not be supplied by static octagonal fibers or the presence of a double scrambler alone .",
    "in addition to the scrambling system described here , hpf will have a modal noise agitator for its fibers @xcite .",
    "we are also exploring new ways of suppressing modal noise for highly coherent calibration sources , where this effect is exacerbated @xcite .",
    "the classical metric used to quantify scrambling performance is _ scrambling gain _",
    "the formal definition of sg is the ratio of the relative displacement of the illumination distribution at the input of the fiber to the relative displacement of the illumination distribution at the output @xcite :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the illumination shift on the fiber , @xmath7 is the fiber diameter , @xmath8 is the measured output centroid shift , and @xmath9 is the width of the fiber ( for near - field measurements ) or the width of the output pupil ( for far - field measurements ) .",
    "several factors influence the minimum scrambling gain required to reach a given velocity precision goal , including telescope guiding precision , spectrograph dispersion , and focal plane sampling . in the case of near - field scrambling (",
    "i.e. guiding induced errors ) the expected velocity error is estimated in equation  [ eq : scram_vel ] :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the effective instrument resolution , @xmath12 is the telescope guiding error , @xmath13 is the size of the fiber on - sky , and sg is the scrambling gain of the fiber delivery system .",
    "note that for instruments that rely on the use of a slit , @xmath11 is the effective resolution of the slit - less fiber in the detector focal plane : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the slit - limited instrument resolution , @xmath16 is the slit width and @xmath17 is the fiber core diameter .    in the case of the hpf spectrograph on het ,",
    "with expected guiding precision of 0.25 `` @xcite , 1.7 '' fibers on sky ( 300 @xmath4 m core diameter ) , a 100 @xmath4 m slit , and an operating resolution of 50,000 , a scrambling gain of @xmath19,000 is required to achieve 30  cm  s@xmath3 stability . in practice , we aim for scrambling gains above 18,000 to ensure comparable velocity precisions even with guiding accuracies as low as 0.5 ",
    "( see figure  [ fig : theo_scram ] ) .",
    "this significantly reduces the risk of having guiding error be a dominant factor in the overall instrument velocity error budget . since the primary science of hpf relies on velocity precision , it was incumbent upon us to meet these stringent , albeit previously undemonstrated , levels of scrambling gain .    ) .",

    "ball lenses have previously been considered for astronomical scrambling devices , but have had varying success due to the unavailability of optimally sized spheres , alignment constraints , and high throughput losses @xcite .",
    "our design of the ball lens scrambler is motivated by the current availability of high - index glasses that provide shorter back focal lengths and simplify fiber coupling .",
    "a ball lens inherently either focuses or collimates light according to input source geometry , and in interchanging angle and position essentially acts as a single lens double scrambler .",
    "the back focal length of the lens ( bfl , see figure  [ fig : ball_cartoon ] ) is calculated from characteristic parameters of a ball lens using equation  [ eq : bfl ] , where @xmath19 is the diameter of the lens , @xmath0 is the refractive index of the glass used , and efl is the effective focal length .",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 the remarkable providence in our ball scrambler design arises from the fact that when material of @xmath22 is used , the bfl goes to _ zero _ , irrespective of ball diameter .",
    "this implies optimum coupling is achieved when the entrance and exit fibers are in direct contact with the lens surface , simplifying the overall scrambler design .",
    "this greatly mitigates the need to position and control the ball lens at a specific distance , centered with high tolerance on the fibers .",
    "we considered two high - index glasses , s - lah79 ( ohara , n@xmath23=2.00330 ) and lasf35 ( schott , n@xmath23=2.02204 ) but chose to test s - lah79 for the prototype ball scrambler due to its availability from vendors in small quantities .",
    "the optimal choice between materials depends on the specific wavelength range of interest but both glasses are well suited for the hpf bandpass .",
    "however , there are a variety of recently available high - index glasses from several manufacturers that cover large wavelength ranges in the visible and nir with relatively low dispersion ( see figure  [ fig : ball_index ] ) . when selecting the appropriate high - index glass for a particular application , both the refractive index and internal glass transmission must be considered to maximize efficiency .",
    "the two primary glasses discussed here have high throughput in the nir ( @xmath299% for a 2 mm lens ) , but have significantly diminished efficiency at wavelengths lower than 400 nm .",
    "however , select glasses shown in figure  [ fig : ball_index ] ( left ) do have relatively high transmission ( @xmath297% ) in the 380 - 400 nm regime for lens diameters under 1 mm , and would be more appropriate for optical instruments .     across a desired wavelength range with low @xmath24.,width=326 ]    the ideal size of the ball ( @xmath19 )",
    "is calculated using equation  [ eq : size ] , as a function of the refractive index of the glass ( @xmath0 ) , the diameter of the input beam or fiber ( @xmath18 ) , and the input numerical aperture ( na ) .",
    "our system is designed for a 300 @xmath4 m fiber fed at @xmath25 at the telescope focal plane , implying an ideal ball lens diameter of 2.15  2.17 mm for our wavelengths . for concept verification purposes , we used more readily available 2 mm s - lah79 ball lenses . for optimum coupling and efficiency",
    ", the expected focal ratio exiting the fiber incident on the lens , rather than the native telescope focal ratio , should be used to select the size of the ball .",
    "this ensures that focal ratio degradation ( frd ) and losses due to the lens are minimal .",
    "alignment of the ball between contiguous fiber faces is critical to producing a high efficiency scrambler .",
    "classical double scramblers suffer throughput losses of 20 - 30% , and an important aspect of our design is to substantially decrease this light loss . while concentricity between the lens and fiber faces is key , it is also necessary to control the distance between ball and fiber tip . with bfl ranging between 10  20 @xmath4 m for our ball diameter and material ,",
    "we essentially want the fiber butt - coupled to the ball .",
    "we developed two mounting methods to minimize coupling losses between the fibers and simplify the alignment process .",
    "both devices yield 85 - 87% efficiency , as measured using nir fiber lasers , with minimal alignment effort using anti - reflective ( ar ) coated ball lenses ( see  [ sec : efficiency ] ) .      in anticipation of a custom - built alignment piece",
    ", we implemented a simple and inexpensive design whereby the ball lens is held between two small rubber o - rings ( figure  [ fig : align ] ) .",
    "the outer diameter of the o - rings ( 2.5 mm ) matches the ferrule size of the commercially standardized fc / pc fiber connectors used on our test fibers , and the entire junction can be placed within an off - the - shelf high - tolerance ceramic split sleeve of inner diameter 2.5 mm .",
    "the lens is naturally kept along the central axis of the fibers by the pressure applied by the mating sleeve . in spite of the simplicity of this design , we are able to demonstrate efficiencies close to the theoretical maximum for a perfectly aligned system (  [ sec : efficiency ] ) with this coupling scheme .",
    "this device was used for the the scrambling measurements presented in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "our second prototype device consists of a custom manufactured , monolithic v - groove block to mount both fibers and the ball lens .",
    "the fibers are placed in a high precision v - groove , while the ball is placed in a drilled mount at the center of the stainless - steel block .",
    "the block is ground to size such that three faces can be used as reference indexing surfaces to within @xmath112 @xmath4 m .",
    "much attention was payed to maintaining the central axis of each element ( input fiber , lens , output fiber ) to high accuracy ( @xmath263 @xmath4 m ) .",
    "this level of accuracy was achieved by taking repeated surface measurements of the the machined block at several stages of the machining process using a high precision smartscope measurement microscope .",
    "a tapered mounting pocket was machined on the block surface to secure the lens on the center of the block face .",
    "the smartscope was then used to measure the central axis of the mounted lens relative to the polished block surface .",
    "the microscope measurements dictate the location and depth of the fiber v - groove relative to the block face , ensuring concentricity between the mounted lens and the fibers .",
    "the v - groove was etched using a high precision electric discharge machine .",

    "an image of the completed v - groove block is shown in figure  [ fig : vgroove ] .",
    "polished octagonal fibers are placed in the groove on either side of the lens and attached to the block with kapton tape .",
    "for laboratory experiments we measure centroid values as a a proxy for scrambling performance . while this is a reasonable metric for near - field scrambling gains",
    ", since near - field illumination centroid drifts will directly manifest as velocity drifts in the focal plane , the direct effect of fiber far - field variation on velocity precision is not as easily quantifiable .",

    "the high - index ball - lens scrambler , when used with a combination of octagonal fibers , satisfies all of these quantities in a single , compact system .",
    "this device is being developed for the near - infrared habitable - zone planet finder spectrograph on the 10-m hobby eberly telescope , but its versatility implies that it could easily be adapted for other current and future fiber - fed precision radial velocity spectrographs such as the carmenes @xcite , minerva @xcite , nres @xcite , and paras @xcite spectrographs . since the het has a uniquely variable illumination pupil , the hpf fiber train will require a configuration that maximizes scrambling , i.e. a combination of octagonal fibers , circular fibers , and a double - scrambler to minimize the scrambling - induced velocity errors .",
    "we have demonstrated the high scrambling performance of this prototype double - scrambler system by examining the extreme cases of input illumination variation . pairing the ball lens scrambler with octagonal fibers yields scrambling gains in excess of 10,000 with high thoughput ( 87% ) .",
    "adding a circular fiber further improves the scrambling gain to @xmath220,000 , limited by our measurement apparatus .",
    "this translates to roughly 10  cm  s@xmath3 velocity error for the hpf instrument due to telescope guiding error , exceeding our goal of 30  cm  s@xmath3 guiding - induced velocity measurement error .    in replicating this system for other fiber - fed spectrographs",
    "it might not be necessary to include every scrambling element , but the inclusion of a compact efficient ball - lens scrambler would stabilize instrument illumination and could substantially benefit many high precision spectrographs . decoupling",
    "the instrument psf from the telescope is a major technical challenge that will need to be overcome for the next generation of extreme precision planet - hunting spectrographs that aim to detect earth - mass extra - solar planets with precisions of @xmath110 cm s@xmath3 @xcite .    due to the monolithic nature and simplistic design ,",
    "this ball lens scrambler could be easily replicated on larger scales for multi - object instruments as well , aiding in precision spectroscopy for upcoming galactic and extra - galactic surveys .            ,",
