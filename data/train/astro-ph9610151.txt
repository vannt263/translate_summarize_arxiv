    "they also concluded , based on the difference in velocity between the ngc 4889 and ngc 4874 groups and the cluster mean , that these groups only recently arrived within the cluster core .    we have revisited the extensive rosat pspc archival data for the coma cluster using a new technique , particularly well - suited to detecting small scale structures embedded within larger scale features .",
    "this technique , `` wavelet transform decomposition '' , allows simultaneous study of the image at all spatial ( angular ) scales and allows identification of the scale appropriate to the detected features . in this _ letter _ , we study the small scale structure of the coma image with this new wavelet transform technique .",
    "we detect a long , narrow x - ray feature and discuss possible explanations as either gas which was ram pressure stripped from a small galaxy group during a recent merger / collision with the cluster or a dark matter perturbation produced by tidally stripped material during a group merger .",
    "we analyzed two rosat pspc pointings of the coma cluster core ( the overall x - ray morphology of the coma cluster seen from pointed rosat observations is discussed in white et al .",
    "images were reduced using the prescriptions and code of snowden et al .",

    "the cleaning resulted in 18 and 13 ksec exposures in individual pointings .",
    "the merged pspc image ( top - left panel in fig  1 ) shows an azimuthally asymmetric cluster ( briel at al .",
    "1992 , white et al .",
    "1993 ) whose core structure we investigate in detail in this _",
    "letter_.      the technique we applied to the rosat pspc `` cleaned '' images employs a set of _  trous _ wavelet transforms , closely following the approach of starck et al .",
    "( 1995 and references therein ) with some important changes in the iteration scheme .",
    "an application of the multi - resolution wavelet - based image filtering for the x - ray images also can be found in slezak et al.(1994 ) .",
    "the _  trous _ wavelet transform of scale @xmath6 can be ( very roughly ) characterized as the convolution of an image with the function equal to the difference between two gaussians , the first positive one with @xmath7 , and the second negative one with @xmath8 .",
    "the basic idea of the wavelet - based image filtering is to perform the set of wavelet transforms with scales @xmath9 , retain only significant wavelet coefficients at each scale ( thus filtering out the noise ) , and perform the image reconstruction from the wavelet planes .",
    "for the _  trous _ wavelet transform , the reconstruction is performed by simple summation of all wavelet planes . at each scale",
    "we retain the wavelet coefficients which exceed some critical amplitude which corresponds to the given number of standard deviations ( @xmath10 in our application ) .",
    "since the wavelet transform is linear , the noise level in each wavelet plane is proportional to the noise level in the original image .",
    "therefore , we can derive the critical amplitudes for each scale using the following approach .",
    "we first apply the wavelet transform to a simulated image containing gaussian noise with dispersion 1 and determine the @xmath11 variations in the wavelet - convolved images .",
    "we then multiply these values by the local noise in the actual image , which is estimated using the local background and exposure . thus , the faintest detectable structures have uniform amplitude in terms of significance , as a function of both position and scale .",

    "the formal statistical significance along the axis of the tail varies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and the surface brightness is @xmath17% of the underlying cluster emission .",
    "( _ top - right _ ) small scale structures shown in bottom panels were subtracted from the coma cluster image , and the result was smoothed with the gaussian @xmath12 . after the subtraction of the small - scale structure the cluster core appears much more regular .",
    "the complex morphology ( elongation , and the rotation of the elongation axis ) therefore reflects the `` hidden '' small - scale structure , not the state of the main cluster body .    to assure the most complete separation of image features in terms of their scale , we apply the following iterative procedure .",
    "we start from the smallest scale , @xmath18 , which roughly corresponds to the fwhm of the rosat pspc psf .",
    "we calculate the wavelet transform on this first scale only , find significant features , and subtract them from the original image ( recall that the back - transformation for the _  trous _ wavelet transform is simply the summation of the wavelet planes ) .",
    "the next iteration is applied to the residual and this process is repeated until no new significant features are found at this scale .",
    "we then start the process with the scale @xmath19 and so on .",
    "the subtraction of the features detected at smaller scales before applying the wavelet transform at larger scales results in a sufficient enhancement of the basic property of the wavelet transform analysis  its ability to separate image features in terms of their characteristic scale .",
    "in particular , we are able to isolate even extremely bright point sources primarily at the two smaller scales ( i.e.  @xmath20 ) , whereas without subtraction , they appear at all scales and often saturate nearby and relatively faint extended structures .    the process described above provides a separation of the original image into a set of images containing only features of scale @xmath6 , @xmath19 , ... significant at least at the @xmath10 level , which can be either summed together to produce an adaptively smoothed image or viewed individually ( or in any desired combination ) to examine the significant structures at desired scales .",
    "contour maps of the images generated for small scales are shown in the bottom panels of fig  1 superposed on an optical image .",
    "on the smallest scales , @xmath13 ( _ bottom - left _ ) , the contours show the extended sources surrounding the two brightest cluster galaxies ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 first detected in x - rays by white et al .",

    "the surface brightness enhancement near ngc 4911 was first noted by white et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    within the outer contour of the filament , the surface brightness ranges from 510% of the underlying diffuse emission from coma itself .",
    "the formal significance along the axis of the filament varies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "features with this significance never appear in simulated coma cluster images .",
    "the counts associated with the emission filament ( within the outer contour shown in bottom - right panel of fig  1 ) correspond to a count rate of @xmath23 cts s@xmath4 in the energy band 0.52 ke-0.05em v. the corresponding luminosity , for 0 and a sufficiently hard spectrum ( see below ) is @xmath24 . at the coma distance ( @xmath25 ) ,",
    "the tail is approximately @xmath26 mpc ( 25 ) in length with a diameter of @xmath27 kpc ( 4 ) .",
    "it is interesting to constrain the spectral properties of the filamentary structure .",
    "it is faint compared to the underlying cluster emission , which therefore can not be neglected and must be carefully subtracted .",
    "we use the following technique for the extraction of the filament s spectrum .",
    "we perform the wavelet decomposition of the broad band image as described above and record all the transformations which have been applied .",
    "the identical transformations are performed to the images in individual energy bands defined by the energies 0.20.40.50.70.91.32 ke-0.05em v. since the wavelet transform is linear , the relative fluxes in different energy bands are conserved and can be used to fit the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , there is a serious problem with the pspc spectral calibration for these particular observations , which results in anomalously low temperatures for the total cluster emission .",
    "we therefore use the ratio of the filament brightness to the underlying cluster brightness as a function of energy to constrain the filament spectrum .",
    "this ratio is constant within the errors , which suggests that the filament has the same spectrum as the coma cluster .",
    "quantitatively , a 95% lower limit to the temperature in the filament is @xmath28 ke-0.05em v , assuming a cluster core temperature of @xmath29 ke-0.05em v(hughes , gorenstein & fabricant 1988 ) .",
    "the wavelet analysis of the rosat pspc x - ray images of the coma cluster demonstrates the existence of a new feature possibly associated with dynamical activity in the cluster core . we can estimate the physical parameters associated with this filament of emission assuming it arises from hot gas",
    "let us assume that we are viewing the filament in the plane of the sky and it is a uniform cylinder of radius @xmath30 kpc and length @xmath26 mpc .",
    "the observed 10% surface brightness enhancement implies that the density of the filament must exceed the cluster gas density at least by about 5% , if the gas is not particularly cool ( @xmath31 a few ke-0.05em v ) .",
    "the relative brightness of the filament does not change much along its axis , therefore the gas density enhancement in the filament is an almost constant small perturbation and one can use the main cluster density profile ( briel et al .",
    "1992 ) to estimate the filament s gas mass .",
    "we derive a total average gas density in the volume defined by the filament of approximately @xmath32 @xmath33 with a range ( along the filament s axis ) from about @xmath34 to @xmath35 @xmath33 .",
    "this density translates into a gas mass of @xmath36 .",
    "we consider two possible scenarios for the origin of this filamentary feature .",
    "first , let us suppose that this feature arises from gas that has been ram pressure stripped from a merging group .",
    "the observed gas mass is well within the reasonable range for the gas mass in the core of a group ( see for example , fig  4 of david et al .",
    "more importantly , however , we must consider whether such a thin structure could survive in the cluster environment .",
    "following cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) , we have computed the evaporation rate for a spherical cloud embedded in the hot icm of the coma cluster . in the coma cluster core",
    ", the classical thermal conduction should provide a reasonable estimate for the evaporation time , which is given as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the embedded cloud density , @xmath39 is its radius in pc , @xmath40 is the temperature of the surrounding , hot medium , and @xmath41 is the coulomb logarithm . for a cloud of radius @xmath42 kpc , density @xmath35 @xmath33 , embedded in a hot medium of temperature",
    "@xmath29 ke-0.05em v , the evaporation time is @xmath43 gyr . in @xmath44 gyr , a galaxy or group traveling at the cluster velocity dispersion could traverse @xmath45 mpc .",
    "the evaporation time at the end of the filament away from the cluster center where its density is lower is significantly shorter . in principle",
    ", cylindrical geometry makes the evaporation time longer by a factor of a few .",
    "also , any chaotic magnetic field could significantly reduce the thermal conduction efficiency and increase the evaporation time - scale .",
    "finally , we do not necessarily need the evaporation time - scale to be smaller or comparable to the traverse time : if the amount of gas deposited into the tail significantly exceeded @xmath36 , it may be mostly evaporated at present , with only the remnants of the group gas providing the observed surface brightness enhancement .",
    "an alternative is that the observed filamentary feature arises from cluster gas compressed in the potential well of the dark matter perturbation formed by a tidally disrupted infalling galaxy group .",
    "merritt ( 1984 ) has shown that galaxy halos are tidally disrupted by the cluster gravitational field . specifically , a gravitationally bound system entering a cluster is tidally limited at a radius @xmath46 given by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the cluster core radius , @xmath49 is the group velocity dispersion , @xmath50 is the cluster velocity dispersion , @xmath51 is the distance from the cluster center , and @xmath52 is a function which has a minimum value of 1/2 at @xmath53 ( see fig  1 in merritt 1984 ) .",
    "the function @xmath52 decreases nearly linearly with decreasing radius and hence an infalling group will be tidally disrupted as it approaches @xmath53 .",
    "the minimum size depends in detail on the parameters of the group and cluster , but for a typical group with @xmath54 km sec@xmath4 in the coma cluster with @xmath55 km sec@xmath4 ( biviano et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath56 kpc ( briel et al .",
    "1992 ) , the maximum tidal radius for an infalling group is @xmath57 kpc .",
    "thus , the group will be progressively disrupted as it approaches the core .",
    "a trail of tidally stripped debris behind the group provides the gravitational potential perturbation which enhances the surface brightness . for isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , the gas density perturbation is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial gas density , and @xmath60 is the gas temperature .",
    "the observed surface brightness enhancement corresponds to a gas density enhancement of about 5% , hence the change in the gravitational potential , @xmath61 , can be written as @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "the gravitational potential on , and near , the surface of a long cylinder is : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the linear mass density , @xmath66 is the length of the cylinder , and @xmath67 is its radius .",
    "if we equate the potential on the surface of the cylinder to the change in the gravitational potential required to produce the observed surface brightness enhancement , then we can solve for the linear mass density in the cylinder .",
    "this provides an expression for the added mass in the cylinder : @xmath68 for the observed properties of the filament , and assuming the gas temperature is that of the cluster , we find a mass of @xmath69 . at",
    "most , the mass could be 50% smaller if the temperature of the gas in the filament is at its measured lower limit .",
    "the surface brightness enhancement also may be underestimated by a factor of a few , since the filament may not be located in the densest part of the projected gas distribution in which case the required density contrast is larger . also , the 10% enhancement in the surface brightness corresponds to more than 10% enhancement in the volume emissivity , because the filament is narrow and projected onto the main cluster emission .",
    "thus , the measured mass in the perturbation is approximately @xmath70  and is uncertain by a factor of about 2 .",
    "this mass is well within the range of that in the central region of a group ( e.g.  david et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we have discussed the filament in some detail , but the remaining emission is also of interest .",
    "the top - right panel in fig  1 compares the `` raw '' smoothed image of coma ( _ top - left _ ) with the smoothed image after subtraction of the detected small scale structure ( _ bottom _ panels ) .",
    "the removal of the two central x - ray peaks around the galaxies ngc 4889 and ngc 4874 , as well as the filament , leaves a smooth and regular - looking x - ray surface brightness distribution .",
    "a relatively small surface brightness perturbation can produce marked irregularity in the surface brightness distribution .",
    "therefore , the small scale structure can significantly influence the overall appearance of the surface brightness distribution of the cluster .",
    "numerical simulations must retain sufficient resolution , if they are to fully model shapes of the x - ray cluster images .",
    "we report the detection of a long , linear filamentary feature extending over approximately @xmath26 mpc from the coma cluster center toward ngc 4911 . we explore two possibilities for the origin of this filament .",
    "first , we show that the filament could arise from ram pressure stripped gas from a group passing through coma , especially if magnetic fields significantly reduce the conduction efficiency and lengthen the evaporation time .",
    "second , we note that tidally stripped dark matter from a merging group could produce a perturbation that would give rise to the observed structure",
    ".    increases in sensitivity and new analysis techniques have continued to demonstrate the complexity of the cluster environment .",
    "the coma cluster , long thought to be the prototype for a relaxed cluster , is in fact a remarkably complex system with structure on many different scales seen both optically and in x - rays ."
