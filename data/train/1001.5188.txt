    "biomembranes are ubiquitous in life , mainly providing spatial compartmentalisation .",
    "however , a membrane should not be viewed as a mere barrier between different compartments , but serves as a place where a whole variety of functions may take place , like ion or protein transport , signal transduction , etc .",
    "these functions come about through proteins that move along the membrane . from a physical perspective",
    "the lateral diffusion of the proteins and the shape changes of the membrane caused upon insertion of proteins are among the most interesting issues of these systems .",
    "the recent progress in experimental techniques to measure lateral diffusion coefficients , like fluorescence correlation spectroscopy  @xcite , single particle tracking  @xcite , or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  @xcite , has revealed that many of the functions performed by proteins are crucially influenced by the diffusive behavior of the proteins  @xcite .",
    "apart from the obvious biological relevance lateral protein diffusion is also very challenging from a theoretical perspective : compared to diffusion in the bulk there is a subtlety in the hydrodynamic equations describing the mobility in a two dimensional fluid , since the solution of the two - dimensional navier - stokes equation diverges . in order to overcome this so - called stokes paradox  @xcite , saffman and delbrck",
    "@xcite considered the mobility of a very thin , rigid object in a narrow almost two - dimensional fluid layer that is surrounded on both sides by a further liquid .",
    "this work has received a lot of attention since it is relevant for lateral protein diffusion .",
    "while some experiments support their result  @xcite , more recent observations for proteins can not be explained by their theory  @xcite .",
    "another aspect that makes diffusion interesting , particularly in membranes , is that the membrane itself is subject to thermal fluctuations ; thus the shape of the membrane is also constantly changing .",
    "methods to analyse shape fluctuations of membranes include off - specular x - ray scattering  @xcite and video microscopy  @xcite . in the latter method the contour of a vesicle",
    "is detected from optical microscopy records taken at successive timesteps .",
    "the changes in the contour provide information on the fluctuation spectrum that is used to deduce effective bending rigidities or surface tensions . in a very recent study rodrguez - garca et al .",
    "@xcite identified the influence of the bilayer nature of a membrane as theoretical calculations  @xcite have previously predicted .",
    "the influence of the density of inclusions embedded in a lipid membrane on the effective bending rigidity was studied by vitkova et al .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the peptide alamethicin was used as the inclusion .",
    "bassereau and co - workers have studied more complicated systems consisting of membranes with inserted proteins and have been able to study the altered fluctuation spectrum of a membrane upon activation of the inserted bacteriorhodopsin proteins  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , a bare membrane is well described as a continuous two - dimensional sheet with a bending rigidity and an effective surface tension .",
    "this model has been very successful in explaining a whole variety of experimentally observed membrane morphologies  @xcite .",
    "likewise , membrane shape fluctuations are well captured by this simple model as shown in video microscopy experiments  @xcite .",
    "the insertion of additional proteins in a membrane requires an extension of this simple continuous model to include the local interacion of a protein with the membrane .",
    "while the influence of thermal membrane fluctuations on the interaction between inclusions has previously been considered in several studies  @xcite , the influence on lateral diffusion or the altered membrane height correlations is much less studied . in previous work involving both analytical calculations and simulations we and others analyzed the geometric effect of measuring the diffusion coefficient from the projected path of the protein  @xcite .",
    "while these studies only included free diffusion , the lateral diffusion of an inclusion that interacts with the membrane shape is considered in recent studies  @xcite .",
    "if the membrane shape fluctuations were not influenced by the protein , the effective diffusion coefficient would be _ increased _ compared to the free diffusion coefficient  @xcite .",
    "however , this simplifying assumption represents too severe an approximation . by including the backaction of the protein on the membrane fluctuations naji et al .",
    "@xcite showed that in equilibrium the effective lateral diffusion coefficient is _ reduced _ for which they were able to give an approximate expression .",
    "parts of the current work are complementary to their study .    on a more collective level ,",
    "the interaction between membrane and embedded proteins can cause morphological changes .",
    "leibler  @xcite studied a model with a protein density field that induces a spontaneous curvature capable of causing an instability of the membrane .",
    "he finds two characteristic time scales for membrane fluctuations , with one of them potentially unstable in a certain wave vector range .",
    "related work by bivas and mlard  @xcite on bending elasticity and fluctuations of spherical bilayer vesicles with additives reveals an additional characteristic time scales . in their work",
    "the bilayer membrane comprises two individual sheets such that the third timescale results from the friction between the two layers .",
    "divet et al .",
    "@xcite studied an extension of leibler s work that allows an exchange of proteins between the membrane and the surrounding fluid .",
    "depending on the considered length scale they find several relevant time scales for membrane height and density fluctuations .",
    "surprisingly , this relevance of different time scales in membrane height correlations has , to the best of our knowledge , not been previously observed in experiments .    in the present work",
    "we study the two interrelated effects following from a protein - membrane interaction : the reduction of the lateral diffusion coefficient of the protein and the modifications of the static and time dependent height correlation functions of the membrane . in our study the additional energy caused by the insertion of the protein arises from an effective bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature of the protein .",
    "the dynamics of our system is dominated by two processes : the shape fluctuations of the membrane and the lateral diffusion of the protein .",
    "taking into account the hydrodynamic interaction of a membrane with the surrounding fluid , we are able to derive a langevin equation for the dynamics of the membrane shape , which becomes a function of the protein s position .",
    "lateral diffusion of the protein is captured by another langevin equation that takes into account the shape of and the interaction with the membrane .",
    "these two coupled equations of motions are the starting point for our analytical calculations and their numerical integration make out our simulation scheme .    using a systematic approach we present two main results for lateral diffusion",
    ": we argue that in equilibrium the effective lateral diffusion coefficient of a protein that interacts with the membrane shape is universally decreased compared to the free diffusion coefficient applicable if no interaction were present . beyond this general argument",
    "we , furthermore , derive an explicit expression for the effective diffusion coefficient of a protein with spontaneous curvature and bending rigidity by applying a path integral approach .",
    "to lowest order , our expression agrees with that recently derived by naji et al .",
    "@xcite through an estimate of the power loss of the diffusing protein in the limit that the membrane shape minimizing the system s energy instantaneously tracks the protein s position .",
    "our approach reveals that their expression resulting from a phenomenological approximation formally corresponds to the lowest order of an expansion in @xmath0 using @xmath1 with temperature @xmath2 , boltzmann s constant @xmath3 , and bending rigidity @xmath4 of the membrane .",
    "we compare results of our simulation scheme with this lowest order expression and find good quantitative agreement .",
    "several correlation functions contribute to the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "the quantitative analysis of these contributions from our simulation results shows that the correlations between the response of the membrane and the preceding stochastic force acting on the protein effectively reduce the diffusion coefficient , while all other contributions would cause an increase .    concerning the altered membrane spectrum we analytically develop an approximate expression for the height correlation function applicable for equal bending rigidity of protein and membrane . in the limit of slow protein diffusion compared to membrane fluctuations",
    "we find two time regimes for the decay of height correlations : at small times the decay is dominated by membrane dynamics , while the diffusive time scale of the protein becomes the only relevant time scale at later times .",
    "since we find this feature in the simulations not only for equal bending rigidities of membrane and protein , we suggest that the experimental analysis of the late decay of dynamical membrane height correlations can provide a means to determine the effective diffusion coefficient of proteins in the membrane .",
    "to corroberate this argument we use our model to give a rough estimate suggesting that the effect should be visible in realistic systems .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we introduce the model of the system and develop the equations of motion both for the protein and the membrane . in the limit of small ratios of temperature and bending rigidity these",

    "in this paper we have considered the influence of a protein interacting with a fluctuating membrane via its bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature on both the dynamics of the protein and the membrane .",
    "the quantities we have looked at in detail are the lateral diffusion coefficient of the protein and the height correlations of membrane fluctuations by use of analytical calculations and langevin simulations .",
    "we argue that the lateral diffusion coefficient of a protein that interacts with the membrane is always reduced compared to its bare diffusion coefficient as long as there are no external driving forces or active processes . using a path integral approach we could derive an analytical expression for this reduction that is valid within the lowest order of a @xmath0-expansion .",
    "our simulations with parameters that resemble those of real experiments show a wide applicability of this expression .",
    "in addition a closer look at the correlation functions that contribute to the reduction of the diffusion coefficient shows that the correlations between the stochastic force acting on the protein and the response of the membrane to the movement of the protein are responsible for the reduction .    the diffusion of the protein is obviously correlated with the height correlations of the membrane .",
    "the determination of the height correlations for the case of equal bending rigidity of the protein and the membrane reveals that the protein - membrane - interaction has a significant influence compared to a free membrane .",
    "the most predominant feature is that the temporal decay of correlations does not only display the timescale one would expect from the membrane , but that the diffusive time scale of the influencing protein becomes important . in realistic biomembrane systems these two time scales",
    "are well separated such that a crossover from the initially fast decay of membrane fluctuations to the slower protein diffusion dominated decay , is likely to be observed in experiments . since the decay at later times",
    "is directly related to the effective diffusion coefficient of the protein , we suggest that the measurement of membrane fluctuations might actually provide a means to determine the lateral diffusion coefficient of the inserted proteins .    our systematic approach to lateral diffusion of a protein interacting with the shape of the membrane and the related influence on the membrane fluctuation spectrum can be extended in various directions .",
    "the first question arising from our study is to work out corrections to the @xmath0-expansion and to estimate their relevance .",
    "a further perspective resulting from our analysis is the interesting limit @xmath193 when the protein effectively moves in a fixed membrane configuration .",
    "this situation is interesting theoretically , since the diffusing particle no longer `` drags along '' the membrane , but is hindered in its movement by potential barriers caused by the interaction of the particle with the membrane . finally ,",
    "while we have so far only considered membranes that are on average flat , the extension to ruffled membranes poses an interesting challenge with significant relevance for biological membranes like the endoplasmic reticulum or the cristae in mitochondria ."
