    "in recent work a new first - principles theory of dynamic arrest has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this consists essentially of the application of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics @xcite to the description of the singular behavior characteristic of dynamic arrest phenomena in specific colloidal systems and conditions .",
    "the scgle theory was originally devised to describe tracer and collective diffusion properties of colloidal dispersions in the short- and intermediate - times regimes @xcite .",
    "its self - consistent character , however , introduces a non - linear dynamic feedback , leading to the prediction of dynamic arrest in these systems , similar to that exhibited by the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the ideal glass transition @xcite . the resulting theory of dynamic arrest in colloidal dispersions",
    "was applied in recent work to describe the glass transition in three mono - disperse experimental model colloidal systems with specific ( hard - sphere , screened electrostatic , and depletion ) inter - particle effective forces @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the scgle theory of dynamic arrest has the same or better level of quantitative predictive power as conventional mct , but is built on a completely independent conceptual basis , thus providing an alternative approach to the description of dynamic arrest phenomena .",
    "there is , however , a possible practical disadvantage of the scgle with respect to the mct , and it refers to the fact that the mct only requires the static structure factor of the system as an external input , whereas the scgle theory requires this information plus other additional static properties involved in the exact short - time conditions that the theory has built - in @xcite .",
    "as it happens , however , the long - time asymptotic solutions of the relaxation equations that constitutes the scgle theory are independent of such exact short - time properties @xcite .",
    "the questions then arise if a simplified version of the scgle theory , in which this short - time information is eliminated , could be proposed , and to what extent such a simpler theory will still provide a reliable representation of the dynamics of the colloidal system not only in the asymptotic long - time regime , but also at earlier stages . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate that there is a simple manner to build this simplified version of the scgle theory , and that it is virtually as accurate as the full version , even in the short- and intermediate - time regimes .",
    "this finding will greatly simplify the application of the scgle theory of dynamic arrest .",
    "let us summarize the four distinct fundamental elements of the full self - consistent generalized langevin equation theory of colloid dynamics .",
    "the first consists of general and exact memory - function expressions for the intermediate scattering function @xmath0 and its self component @xmath1 , derived with the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) formalism @xcite , which in laplace space read @xcite    @xmath2    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the free - diffusion coefficient , @xmath5 is the static structure factor of the system , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the corresponding memory functions .",
    "the second element is an approximate relationship between collective and self - dynamics . in the original proposal of the scgle theory",
    "@xcite , two possibilities , referred to as the additive and the multiplicative vineyard - like approximations , were considered .",
    "the first approximates the difference @xmath8 $ ] , and the second the ratio @xmath9 $ ] , of the memory functions , by their exact short - time limits , using the fact that the exact short - time expressions for these memory functions , denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are known in terms of equilibrium structural properties @xcite .",
    "the multiplicative approximation was devised to describe more accurately the very early relaxation of @xmath0 @xcite , but the additive approximation was found to provide a more accurate prediction of dynamic arrest phenomena @xcite . in this paper , for  full scgle theory \" we refer to the theory that involves the _ additive _ vineyard - like approximation ,    @xmath12 . \\label{additive}\\ ] ]    the third ingredient consists of the independent approximate determination of @xmath1 [ or @xmath13 .",
    "one intuitively expects that these @xmath14-dependent self - diffusion properties should be simply related to the properties that describe the brownian motion of individual particles , just like in the gaussian approximation @xcite , which expresses @xmath1 in terms of the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath15 as @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "we introduce an analogous approximate connection , but at the level of their respective memory functions .",
    "the memory function of @xmath17 is the so - called time - dependent friction function @xmath18 .",
    "this function , normalized by the solvent friction @xmath19 , is the _ exact _ long wave - length limit of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we interpolate @xmath20 between its two limits , namely ,    @xmath22 \\lambda ( k ) , \\label{interpolation}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath23^{-1 } \\label{lambdadk}\\ ] ]    is a phenomenological interpolating function , with @xmath24 being the position of the first minimum that follows the main peak of @xmath5 @xcite",
    ".    the fourth ingredient of our theory is another exact result , also derived within the gle approach @xcite , this time for @xmath25 .",
    "this exact result may , upon a well - defined simplifying approximation , be converted into the following approximate but general expression @xcite    @xmath26}{s(k)}\\right ] ^{2}f(k , t)f_{s}(k , t ) .",
    "\\label{dzdt}\\ ] ]    eqs .",
    "( [ fkz])([dzdt ] ) constitute the full scgle theory of colloid dynamics .",
    "besides the unknown dynamic properties , it involves the equilibrium properties @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , determined by the methods of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics .",
    "we should also point out that eqs .",
    "( [ fkz ] ) and ( [ fskz ] ) are exact results , and that eq .",
    "( [ dzdt ] ) derives from another exact result .",
    "hence , it should not be a surprise that the same results are used by other theories ; in fact , the same equations are employed in mct .",
    "the difference lies , of course , in the the manner we relate and use them . in this sense ,",
    "the distinctive elements of the scgle theory are the vineyard - like approximation in eq .",
    "( [ additive ] ) and the interpolating approximation in eq .",
    "( [ interpolation ] ) .    the simplified version of the scgle theory is now suggested by the form that these distinctive equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ additive ] ) and ( [ interpolation ] ) ) attain for times longer than the relaxation time of the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 . under those conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ additive ] ) and ( [ interpolation ] ) become , respectively ,    @xmath27    and    @xmath28 \\lambda ( k ) .",
    "\\label{simplerinterpolation}\\ ] ]    it is not difficult to see that the original self - consistent set of equations ( involving eqs .",
    "( [ additive ] ) and ( [ interpolation ] ) ) shares the same long - time asymptotic stationary solutions as its simplified version .",
    "such stationary solutions are given by @xcite    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the solution of the following equation    @xmath32 ^{2}\\lambda^2 ( k)}{\\left[\\lambda ( k)s(k ) + k^2\\gamma\\right]\\left[\\lambda ( k ) + k^2\\gamma\\right]}. \\label{nep5pp}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath31 is the long - time asymptotic value , of the msd , i.e. , @xmath33 . in the arrested states ,",
    "this parameter is finite , representing the localization of the particles , whereas in the ergodic states it diverges .",
    "it is then natural to ask what the consequences would be of replacing eqs .",
    "( [ additive ] ) and ( [ interpolation ] ) of the full scgle set of equations by the simpler approximations in eqs .",
    "( [ simpleradditive ] ) and ( [ simplerinterpolation ] ) , that no longer contain the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "our proposal of a simplified version of the scgle theory consists precisely of this replacement , so that the  simplified scgle theory \" consists of the exact results in eqs .",
    "( [ fkz ] ) and ( [ fskz ] ) along with eqs .",
    "( [ lambdadk ] ) and ( [ dzdt ] ) , complemented by the closure approximations in eqs .",
    "( [ simpleradditive ] ) and ( [ simplerinterpolation ] ) .",
    "we have made a systematic comparison of the various dynamic properties involved in the scgle theory , including the intermediate scattering function @xmath0 , its self component @xmath1 , and other tracer - diffusion properties such as the time - dependent friction function @xmath34 , the mean squared displacement or the time - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath35 .",
    "as expected , the scenario of dynamic arrest exhibited by this simpler theory is identical to that provided by the full scglescheme .",
    "this is probably not surprising since , as indicated above , both sets of dynamic equations share the same long - time asymptotic behavior and the same asymptotic stationary solutions .",
    "what is surprising , however , is the degree of accuracy of the simplified theory in the short- and intermediate - time regimes . in our systematic comparison",
    "we considered systems with soft - sphere , hard - sphere , and repulsive yukawa interactions , systems with attractive ( yukawa ) interactions , systems in three and in two dimensions , and both , mono - disperse and bi - disperse systems , in all cases with similar conclusions , that we illustrate with the following examples .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] we plot the intermediate scattering function @xmath0 as a function of time , evaluated at the position @xmath36 of the first maximum of the static structure factor of a soft - sphere system .",
    "the pair potential , in units of the thermal energy @xmath37 , is given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and it vanishes for @xmath40 .",
    "the system in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] corresponds to @xmath41 and to the volume fractions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , and the static structure factor was calculated using the prescription of verlet and weis @xcite .",
    "the heavy - solid lines correspond to the simplified version , and the heavy - dashed lines to the full version , of the scgle theory .",
    "the very first feature to notice is the virtual coincidence of the results of these two approximations ; in fact , only for @xmath45 the difference is appreciable . for the other volume fractions",
    "the results are not distinguishable in the scale of the figure , and this includes the vicinity of the glass transition which , as can be seen in the figure , is predicted to occur at @xmath46 for this soft - sphere system .",
    "for @xmath45 we also show the brownian dynamics data ( solid circles ) reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the results of the scgle theory within the _ multiplicative _ vineyard - like approximation ( soft dashed lines ) , to recall the fact that the multiplicative approximation sometimes provides a slightly more accurate quantitative description of the initial relaxation of @xmath0 ( see the inset ) . in a longer time - scale ,",
    "as indicated in the main figure , the prediction of the overall relaxation provided by the scgle theory complemented with the additive and the multiplicative approximations is quite similar .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the additive approximation provides a simpler and more accurate description of dynamic arrest , partly because these phenomena do not seem to depend strongly on the short - time behavior illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "thus , from now on , we shall omit further reference to the multiplicative approximation .",
    "a similar situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , this time for a system of colloidal particles interacting though a hard - sphere potential of diameter @xmath47 plus an additional long - ranged repulsive yukawa tail of the form @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for a volume fraction @xmath51",
    ", it corresponds to the conditions of fig .  1 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in our present figure , however , we compare the full and the simplified scgle theory for the time - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath52 and for the intermediate scattering functions @xmath0 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in the short - time regime , where these differences are expected to be larger .",
    "our present comparison indicates that the new simplified version of the scgle theory leads to essentially identical results , even in these time regimes .",
    "just like the mct has been extended to mixtures @xcite , the scgle has also been extended to multi - component colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "also in this case the simplified version of the scgle theory provides virtually the same description as the full scgle scheme , but its practical application is far simpler . in fig .  [ fig.3 ]",
    "a comparison is presented for a binary yukawa mixture , with pair potential @xmath55 in which a fraction @xmath56 of the particles ( species @xmath57 ) interact with a charge parameter @xmath58 , the other fraction @xmath59 ( species 2 ) with @xmath60 .",
    "the volume fraction of the more interacting species is kept fixed at @xmath61 and @xmath62 takes the values @xmath63 ( right column ) , @xmath64 ( middle column ) , and @xmath65(left column ) , corresponding to @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this figure corresponds to the same conditions as fig .",
    "3 of ref .",
    "@xcite and , as in our previous example , the simulated @xmath5 was employed .",
    "it simply confirms the general conclusions of this communication , namely , that the simplified scgle theory provides a description of the relaxation of concentration fluctuations in colloidal suspensions qualitatively and quantitatively virtually identical to the full scgle theory .",
    "its practical implementation , however , is much simpler than either the full scgle or the mct schemes .",
    "this has simplified the application of the scgle theory to the discussion of dynamic arrest in colloidal mixtures @xcite and in colloidal fluids adsorbed in model porous media @xcite , that we report in separate communications .",
