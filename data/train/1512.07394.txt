    "the study on reionization history of our universe remains to be an open question in modern cosmology .",
    "it is commonly believed that our universe should be neutral after recombination epoch , the so called dark age .",
    "after that , the first generation of galaxies provide ultraviolet radiation so that the igm start to be ionized from neutral phase . such phase transition of the igm is the so called reionization history and it relates to many fundamental questions of astrophysics , since detailed reionization process depends on the formation and evolution of high energy astrophysical objects , such as mini - quasars , x - ray binaries , metal - free stars , etc . , which provide the sources for reionization transition .",
    "a lot of astronomical observations provide the information of reionization , for example , the level of ionized state at different epochs , even though we could not observe the reionizing process directly .",
    "lymann-@xmath4 forests , a series of absorption lines in the spectra of distant sources(quasars or galaxies ) from the lymann-@xmath4 electron transition of the neutral hydrogen atom(hi ) , could be an important tracer of igm ionizing .",
    "if there exists homogenious distribution of hi gas in the line of sight from source to observer , the lymann-@xmath4 forest will turn into a gunn - peterson ( gp ) trough@xcite , so by observing gp trough , we can map the neutral hydrogen in the igm . from the detection of lymann-@xmath4 absorption lines or gp trough , we know that the universe is highly ionized at least until @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , the astronomical observations provide some evidence that there exists hi in the igm at @xmath6 .",
    "those observations show that reionization should last for a period of time .",
    "some other experiments can put constraints on reionization history as well , for example 21 cm experiments which can measure the distribution of hi(@xmath7 ) , and traces the evolution of reionziation .",
    "there are a number of 21 cm experiments , such as gmrt@xcite , lofar@xcite , mwa@xcite , 21cma@xcite , and paper@xcite .",
    "however , due to their low signal - to - noise ratios , none of them can give convincing results about history of reionization at current stage .",
    "measuring the temperature of igm can also give some constraints on the epoch of reionization@xcite .    the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb )",
    "provides useful information on reionization history .",
    "once the igm are ionized , there will be lots of electrons and the interactions between cmb photons and electrons through thomson scattering will deform the black body distribution of cmb@xcite which can be imprinted in cmb maps .",
    "@xmath1 is an important cosmological parameter in cmb for describing the post thomson scattering effects , and @xmath1 is an integration of the reionized fraction ( which labeled as @xmath0 ) , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the conformal time , @xmath10 is the present time , @xmath11 is the thomson cross section and @xmath12 is the number density of free electrons produced by reionization . in cmb power spectra of tt and ee , on small angular scales ,",
    "there is a reducing factor of @xmath13 . for polarization power spectrum @xmath14",
    ", it is enhanced on large angular scale since the scattering would generate extra polarization , and the enhancement has already detected from many cmb experiments .",
    "these effects describing here is only about the globally averaged reionization , the perturbation of the reionization(inhomogeneous effect ) can change @xmath14 on small angular scale , but it is very fainter than weak lensing effect@xcite , and we wo nt consider it in this project . there has being lots of cmb experiments done in recent decades , and the data are becoming more and more accurate . also tight constraints are performed on the reionization optical depth , such as wmap 9 years data@xcite gives @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 from planck temperature and lensing data@xcite , where @xmath19 gives the epoch of the ionized fraction equals to one half .",
    "when using the cmb data , people always adopt an instantaneous model to characterize the evolution of reionzation process , in which , the igm are suddenly reionized in a very short time , and the reionizing process is very short so that the function of ionized fraction @xmath0 can be described by a tanh - based function@xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is a constant with value @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is some constant , and there is one to one correspondence between the optical depth(@xmath1 ) and the redshift of reionization(@xmath19 ) when @xmath27 is given .",
    "it is well known that the epoch of reionization is very complicated , there is no evidence that the history of reionization is just an instantaneous model .",
    "also , considering that @xmath1 is the integration of the reionized fraction , the constraints on @xmath1 should be very model dependent , that is to say it will introduce bias with strong assumption on reionization model .",
    "in fact , in this way , @xmath1 can not provide more detailed information on reionization history , since different reionization models can give same optical depth . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] , different reionized model could generate different @xmath14 ( in right panel ) even for the same @xmath1(in the left panel ) .",
    "so , we see that the ionized fraction parameter @xmath0 are the more basic parameters for describing reionization history .    very recently , planck have released their new results , the whole sky map of cmb anisotropies including both temperature and polarization , which gives the most accurate measurements on cmb .",
    "the high quality data provides a wealth of new information on cosmology .",
    "the tt spectrum is accurately measured to multipoles @xmath28 , and by cross checking with the high resolution ground based cmb observations , such as act@xcite , spt@xcite , the `` damping tail '' is measured with high accuracy in the planck tt power spectrum at @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the most important is that , the cross checking show that te and ee spectra are in good agreement with tt , which provides an important test of the accuracy of the data sets . with the new measurement , in this paper ,",
    "we do a model independent study of the reionization evolution history .",
    "we totally abandon the assumption of instantaneous model , instead , we separate the reionization history into several bins in redshift space , and take @xmath0 for each @xmath3 bin as a free parameter . by doing the global fitting",
    ", we can get constraints on @xmath0 and reconstruct the reionization history .",
    "further more , we adopt the principle component analysis ( pca ) method in our study to get tighter and more reasonable constraints .",
    "pca are widely used in the literature for optimizing the signal to noise ratio and solving for high quality estimation on target parameters .",
    "we have noted that extracting the information of reionization history from astronomic observations are widely studied in the literatures .",
    "the structure of our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we illustrate the motivation for the model independent study of reionization history . in section iii",
    "we introduce the data sets that adopted in the fitting analysis , the global fitting procedure and principle component analysis method .",
    "the final constraints are presented in section iv .",
    "a summary and conclusion are given in section v.",
    "in fact , even for the same @xmath1 , we can have different kinds of reionization history which will lead to different power spectra , especially for e mode at small @xmath29 , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] . to see the detailed effect that reionization history have on power spectra , we perturb the instantaneous model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : perturbation ] , at different redshift bins .",
    "we choose a bin width of @xmath32 to segment the redshift from z=0 to 15 , at each run we take the excursion value as @xmath33 at only one bin while remaining the other bins @xmath34 .",
    "the differences of power spectra @xmath35 are shown in right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : perturbation ] . from the location of the peaks ,",
    "we know that perturbations at high redshift influence relative high @xmath36 spectrum more , and low redshift perturbations have more effect at low @xmath36 .",
    "we limit @xmath37 since the polarization power spectra at @xmath38 are irrelevant to our analysis of reionization .    as we know",
    "that , @xmath1 is a very important parameter when performing the data analysis with cmb , however , it will give bias when we only consider @xmath1 instead of reionization fraction @xmath0 . in order to see",
    "the bias introduced by instantaneous assumption , we simulate future cmb experiments with a non - instantaneous model , and then perform the fitting with an instantaneous model , and compare the final constraints on @xmath1 with the fiducial model .",
    "the fiducial model , a double ionized @xmath39 function is plotted in left of fig .",
    "[ figure : simulation ] in solid line , with this model , by the integration , the optical depth is 0.055 .",

    "our numerical calculation of global fitting analysis are performed by using a modified cosmomc package@xcite by rewritten the reionization history relevant package .",
    "we segment the epoch of reionization into several bins in redshift space , and we take the ionized fraction @xmath45 in each bins as a constant . in this way , the reionization should not be biased by the prior assumption .",
