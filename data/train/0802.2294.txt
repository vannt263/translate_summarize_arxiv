    "the @xmath4-cocycle conditions of hochschild cohomology of algebras and bialgebras are interpreted in deformations of algebras  @xcite . in other words , a map satisfying the associativity condition can be deformed to obtain a new associative map in a larger vector space using @xmath4-cocycles .",
    "our motivation for this paper and other recent work @xcite comes from the fact that quandle cocycles @xcite can be regarded as giving cocycle deformations of @xmath2-matrices ( solutions to the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) ) .",

    "cohomology theories of lie algebras and quandles were given a unified definition , and deformations of @xmath2-matrices were constructed . in @xcite ,",
    "the adjoint map of hopf algebras , which corresponds to the group conjugation map , was studied from the same viewpoint .",
    "a cohomology theory was constructed based on equalities satisfied by the adjoint map that are sufficient for it to satisfy the ybe .",
    "finally , in @xcite we presented an analog for frobenius algebras using multiplication and comultiplication .    in the first half of this paper",
    ", we will describe a general principle of constructing deformation @xmath4-cocycles from algebraic identities ( such as associativity ) that relate two ( apparently ) distinct tensor operators . then in the second half",
    ", the principle is applied to the kauffman bracket pairings to construct @xmath4-cocycle deformations of bracket @xmath2-matrices .",
    "this is the same approach that we took in @xcite . in this way",
    ", we are extending these methods to another algebraic structure .",
    "the cup - cap pairings are among the most simple of which we can conceive . yet",
    "that there is a deformation theory even here strikes us as interesting . in our final section , we will discuss the knot invariants that result from these deformed @xmath2-matrices .",
    "in the deformation theory of algebras and coalgebras @xcite , deformation cocycles arise as the primary obstructions to extending a formal deformation of the algebraic structure .",
    "we observe in this section that the cocycle conditions , in general , can be loosely described as  infiltrating an algebraic condition \" with an arbitrary function .",
    "a standard example will help illustrate the idea . given a @xmath4-cocycle @xmath5 ,",
    "the @xmath4-cocycle condition of an associative algebra @xmath6 is written as @xmath7 for @xmath8 or in the multiplicative notation of linear maps @xmath9 @xmath10 to derive this formula , take the associative law @xmath11 , write it as @xmath12 , and put distinct subscripts on the multiplication maps for both sides of the identity to obtain @xmath13 . then take a formal sum of each side by replacing each of the maps in turn by a map @xmath5 to obtain @xmath14 by removing the subscripts",
    ", we obtain the @xmath4-cocycle condition ( [ 2cocyeqn ] ) .",

    "this scenario has been generalized to a large variety of cases including our work in @xcite .",
