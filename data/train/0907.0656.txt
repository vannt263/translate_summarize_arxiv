    "viscoelasticity is a notion that unifies solids and fluids ( see @xcite for example ) , and is applied to a wide range of materials as in rheology @xcite .",
    "viscoelastic materials behave as solids during short intervals of time , while they do as ordinary viscous fluids at long time scales @xcite .    in order to get a concrete image for viscoelastic materials ,",
    "let us imagine something like a chewing gum .",
    "we can see many particles bonding in it to each other ( see fig.[reconnection ] ) .",
    "when the material is stressed , the bonds produce an elastic force and try to make the particles back to the original configuration .",
    "that is , the system exhibits elasticity during short intervals of time .",
    "however , if we keep the deformation for a long time , then the bonding structure changes to reduce the free energy as in fig.[reconnection ] , and the shear stress vanishes .",
    "we further assume that the material is elastic for compressions even for long time scales , so that the bulk stress does not undergo such relaxation ( see fig.[bulk ] ) .",
    "thus the system exhibits fluidity at long intervals of time .            in this paper",
    ", we propose a framework in which the characteristics of elasticity and fluidity can be both dealt with on equal footings .",
    "we introduce two key ingredients .",
    "one is a new variable ( to be called the intrinsic metric ) which represents the bonding structures .",
    "the other is the gauge symmetry of foliation preserving diffeomorphisms ( fpds),ava @xcite . for mathematical details of fpds , see also @xcite . ] which we find to interpolate between the two extreme limits of elasticity and fluidity in a natural manner .",
    "we show that requiring the invariance under fpds uniquely determines the dynamics of viscoelastic systems in the first order of strains .",
    "for an elastic material , a sufficiently small region around any point can always be regarded as being deformed from the configuration with no strains .",
    "we call the shape before the deformation the natural shape ( see fig.[chewing ] ) .",
    "this is a straightforward generalization of the notion of the  natural length \" for a spring or a rubber string . for a viscoelastic material",
    ", we assume that it exhibits the elasticity during short time intervals , so that we can define the natural shape around a given point at each moment . since the natural shape is constant in time for elastic materials , its time dependence represents the plasticity ( i.e.non-elasticity ) of the material . in order to describe the natural shape quantitatively",
    ", we introduce a new dynamical variable to be called the intrinsic metric , and discuss its properties in this section .        at each time @xmath3",
    ", we introduce coordinates @xmath4 @xmath5 arbitrarily on the material .",
    "move smoothly on the material as the time @xmath3 varies . ]",
    "we then define the intrinsic metric of the material ( denoted by @xmath6 ) such that the distance between two points at @xmath7 and @xmath8 at fixed time @xmath3 is given by the distance in the natural shape ( see fig.[chewing_gum ] ) : @xmath9        we let @xmath10 be the spatial cartesian coordinates of the point with @xmath7 at @xmath3 .",
    "we emphasize that the intrinsic metric @xmath6 is independent of @xmath10 , and can differ from the induced metric , we write @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ]",
    "@xmath13 which measures the distance in the real three - dimensional space ( see fig.[chewing_gum ] ) .",
    "note that their discrepancies @xmath14 represent the strain tensor of the system . in order to see this ,",
    "let us consider an elastic material .",
    "we take the coordinates @xmath7 such that they move with the atoms and coincide with their cartesian coordinates in the mechanical equilibrium . when the material is deformed slightly , the atom labeled with @xmath7 has the coordinates @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the displacement vector , and we have @xmath17 since the intrinsic metric keeps taking the values in the mechanical equilibrium , @xmath18 , we have that @xmath19 .",
    "this shows that @xmath20 is certainly the strain tensor for elastic systems . in the following discussions , we make the linear approximation with respect to @xmath20",
    "this implies that for the quantities of @xmath21 one can raise or lower vector indices by either of @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the mass density in the absence of strains . in this paper , we assume that @xmath24 is a constant independent of @xmath7 and @xmath3 . then the mass contained in a volume element @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , and the mass density in the real three - dimensional space is given by @xmath27    as an example , let us consider a squeeze deformation of a two - dimensional viscoelastic material formed by bonding particles as in fig.[example3 ] .",
    "@xmath28    the wavy lines stand for the bonds .",
    "the left figure represents the material before the deformation .",
    "here we take @xmath7 to be cartesian coordinates , and then both of the induced and intrinsic metrics have the same form : @xmath29 .",
    "therefore the mass density @xmath30 is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 are attached to the particles , so that they comove with the material under the deformation .",
    "the middle figure represents the material just after the deformation .",
    "the induced metric and the mass density change according to the deformation , while the intrinsic metric does not .",
    "the induced metric is evaluated as @xmath31 by using the cosine formula .",
    "the right figure represents the material after a sufficiently long time . in the process of relaxation ,",
    "the induced metric and the mass density are preserved , while the intrinsic metric @xmath22 becomes proportional to @xmath23 , @xmath32 , as will be discussed around .",
    "the factor @xmath33 can be determined from @xmath30 through .",
    "since we have introduced a different coordinate system @xmath7 at each time , in order to describe the actual motion of a material one needs to specify how the fluid particles move relatively to the coordinate system @xmath7 .",
    "this can be realized by introducing a vector field @xmath34 , with which the fluid particle located at @xmath7 at time @xmath3 is supposed to move to the position @xmath35 after the time interval @xmath36 ( see fig.[shift ] ) .        in fact , by using @xmath37 , the time derivative along the path of a fluid particle ( the material derivative ) of a scalar quantity @xmath38",
    "can be expressed as @xmath39 for example , when measured in the real space , the velocity @xmath40 and the acceleration @xmath41 of the fluid particle located at @xmath7 are given by @xmath42    then we consider the foliation preserving diffeomorphism ( fpd ) : @xmath43 we say that a quantity @xmath44 is a covariant tensor , if it transforms as a three - dimensional tensor at each time : @xmath45 where the transition functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 should be evaluated at time @xmath3 . for example , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are covariant scalars , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath20 are rank two covariant tensors .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath37 is not a covariant vector but transforms with an inhomogeneous term : can be regarded as a gauge field that appears when the three - dimensional diffeomorphism is gauged in the time direction . ]",
    "@xmath51 to see this , let us consider a fluid particle in two different coordinate systems , and assume that it has the coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , at time @xmath3 . then , by definition , at time @xmath54 , they become @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . because these are related by the transformation at @xmath54",
    ", we have @xmath57 and thus we obtain .    note that the time derivative of a covariant tensor @xmath58 is no longer covariant .",
    "we , however , can make a covariant tensor by considering the derivative along fluid particles as in and : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the lie derivative with respect to the vector field @xmath61 : @xmath62 for example , from @xmath22 , we can make a covariant tensor @xmath63 to be called the extrinsic curvature , @xmath64 similarly , we can define the extrinsic curvature @xmath65 which corresponds to @xmath23 , @xmath66 note that @xmath67    we then introduce the dreibeins @xmath68 and their inverses @xmath69 : @xmath70 from and , we obtain @xmath71 and thus @xmath72 by using the dreibeins , the scalars @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be transformed into vector fields as @xmath73 we can calculate the acceleration @xmath74 by using the leibniz rule for @xmath75 and as @xmath76 furthermore , by using the first of and , we can show @xmath77    the set of fpds forms a gauge symmetry group of the system , which can be gauge - fixed arbitrarily according to convenience in describing the dynamics of a given system .",
    "two of the useful gauge fixings are the followings :     + we set @xmath78 . in this frame",
    ", @xmath10 describes the motion of the fluid particle attached to the coordinate @xmath7 , and we have @xmath79 this frame is useful for describing the dynamics of elastic materials . note that the acceleration field ( [ 3.12 ] ) is expressed as @xmath80 the last term gives the inertial force .",
    "+ we set @xmath81 . in this frame",
    ", we have @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then , from and we obtain @xmath85 this frame is useful for describing the dynamics of fluid .",
    "note that the acceleration field ( [ 3.12 ] ) represents the material derivative of the velocity field @xmath86",
    "we are now in a position to write down a set of equations which determine the time evolution of @xmath10 , @xmath6 and @xmath34 up to fpds .",
    "the covariance under fpds is found to be powerful enough to uniquely determine the dynamics in the first order of @xmath20 .",
    "we first consider the limiting case of elasticity . due to our definition of the intrinsic metric",
    ", @xmath6 should be constant in time for elastic materials in the comoving frame ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the fpd - covariant expression for this statement is that the extrinsic curvature @xmath63 of ( [ kg_ab ] ) vanishes : @xmath88 this implies that the non - vanishing @xmath63 represents the genuinely plastic deformations .    in order to make further discussions , we need to separate the trace part from @xmath63 because it vanishes for any materials due to the mass conservation of the system : @xmath89 in fact , contracting ( [ kg_ab ] ) with @xmath90",
    ", we obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the mass density with respect to the intrinsic metric .",
    "this indicates that the vanishing of @xmath93 is equivalent to the mass conservation , which can be easily seen in the comoving frame where @xmath87 and @xmath94 .",
    "the traceless part of @xmath63 on the other hand describes the rate of the shear deformation of the intrinsic metric , and thus is expected to be proportional to the traceless part of the strain tensor @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the relaxation time , and @xmath97 we call the rheology equation hereafter . after a time interval much longer than @xmath96 , @xmath98 vanishes and thus @xmath6 becomes proportional to @xmath99 : @xmath100 where @xmath33 is determined by the mass conservation as in the example in sec .",
    "[ geometricsetup ] .",
    "the equation ( [ feq_relax ] ) is the simplest and is expected to be universal .",
    "it is consistent with ( [ elastic_limit ] ) because the elastic limit corresponds to @xmath101 .",
    "the fluid limit is also realized correctly by taking @xmath102 , in which we have @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 as in ( [ gproph ] ) .",
    "the only remaining degree of freedom of @xmath22 becomes the density of the material , which means that the system corresponds to an isotropic fluid .",
    "note that ( [ feq_mass ] ) and ( [ feq_relax ] ) indicate that all the components of @xmath63 are of the order @xmath104 .",
    "then from we find that so are those of @xmath105 , and we have @xmath106    the dynamics of @xmath10 should be expressed as euler s equation which is written with the stress tensor @xmath107 as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath23 . we show that the leading form of the stress tensor in the derivative expansion can be determined by the following requirements :    * @xmath107 is symmetric and covariant under fpds .",
    "* @xmath107 is linear in the strain @xmath20 and the spatial derivative of the velocity , @xmath110 .",
    "the above requirements imply that @xmath107 is a linear combination of the irreducible components of @xmath20 and @xmath111 ( see ): @xmath112 where @xmath113 from the discussions around , we find that all the terms in ( [ stress_general ] ) are of the order of @xmath104 .    in order to see the meaning of the coefficients in ( [ stress_general ] ) , we consider two extreme limits of elasticity and fluidity .",
    "we first consider the elastic limit .",
    "since @xmath114 in the elastic limit ( see ) , the formulas and lead to @xmath115 and thus we have @xmath116 this indicates that the parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the shear and bulk moduli , respectively .",
    "the last two terms express frictions .",
    "on the other hand , the fluid limit is realized by considering the case where the time scale @xmath119 of the variation of the shear strain @xmath120 , @xmath121 is much longer than the relaxation time @xmath96 , @xmath122 .",
    "we then can show that @xmath123 because the following holds due to : @xmath124 since @xmath125 , we can rewrite the stress tensor ( [ stress_general ] ) into @xmath126 where @xmath127 by using , each term in ( [ tab2 ] ) can be interpreted in terms of fluid mechanics if we take the laboratory frame ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 which indicates that @xmath131 and @xmath132 represent the shear and bulk viscosities of the fluid , respectively . reflects the friction which the material already has in the elastic limit , while the second term @xmath133 represents the stress caused by the strain as the material undergoes plastic deformations @xcite . ] the third term in ( [ tab2 ] ) can be interpreted as the pressure : @xmath134 to see this , we notice that @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) measures the deviation of the real volume element from that of the natural shape , we have @xmath137 ] and that the pressure vanishes in the natural shape . therefore @xmath138 must be proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "we then find that @xmath140 agrees with the coefficient of compression because @xmath141 ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "the set of equations ( [ feq_mass ] ) , ( [ feq_relax ] ) , ( [ feq_ns ] ) , ( [ stress_general ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) are the fundamental equations which govern the dynamics of a given viscoelastic material .",
    "we can see that macroscopic properties of such materials are characterized only by six parameters @xmath144 from which another parameter @xmath117 is obtained via ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "we have proposed a set of fundamental equations to describe generic viscoelastic systems in a unified way .",
    "it is expressed as a world volume theory with the target space coordinates @xmath10 and the intrinsic metric @xmath6 .",
    "fpds play an important role in interpolating the two extreme limits of elasticity and fluidity .",
    "we have shown that the covariance under fpds uniquely determines the form of the equations in the first order of strains .",
    "we thus conclude that the set of equations gives a universal description of viscoelastic systems .    here",
    "we have considered viscoelastic systems with a single relaxation time .",
