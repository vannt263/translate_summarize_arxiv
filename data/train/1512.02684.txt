    "the advent of miniaturized sensing hardware  @xcite and the possibility of in - situ monitoring of the human body is poised to revolutionize healthcare  @xcite .",
    "this vision requires a connected network that will not only report back sensed physiological data , but may also control actuation systems , for e.g. , instantaneous drug delivery or electrical discharge for pre - emptive seizure mitigation .",
    "[ fig : intro ] shows a sample scenario for a human fore - arm , where the surface nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are on - skin sensors while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are implanted sensors / actuators . such an intra - body network ( ibn ) must offer sufficient data transmission rates for timely diagnosis of critical ailments but must also be highly energy conserving , given the practical difficulty in retrieving implants from the body .",
    "ibn technologies that use over - the - air techniques to establish wireless links , such as capacitive coupling or radio frequency ( rf ) signaling  @xcite , require a common ground connection that is not possible within implants or incur high attenuation , respectively .",
    "as an energy - efficient and safe alternative , we adopt galvanic coupling ( gc ) based ibn ( so called gc - ibn ) . in this technology , a pair of electrodes in a given node couple a weak modulated signal ( @xmath4 ) into the tissue obeying the safety limits  @xcite .",
    "majority of the coupled current passes through the return path of transmitter and a minor part ( @xmath5 @xmath6 for surface node and @xmath5 @xmath7 for implants ) propagates through the tissues .",
    "the difference in potential is detected by the electrode pair at the receiver - end that demodulates the signal and extracts the data .",
    "[ fig : intro ]    @xmath8 * problem definition . * given the weak signal strength , the network performance of the gc - ibn depends on the length of the links , which is in turn determined by the position of the signal aggregation points or relays .",
    "while the gc channel has been modeled earlier in  @xcite , there is no prior work on designing a practical network based on the channel observations . to address this gap",
    ", this paper develops a theoretical framework for designing a clustered network , where multiple implants at various depths inside body tissues ( @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) are served by an external on - skin relay ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the on - skin relays may also forward data to reach a specific relay ( @xmath11 ) that has rf capability to connect with the outside world .",
    "the clustering problem presented here is different from the extensive work for classical wireless sensors that exists today in the following ways : ( i ) in an ibn , considering the sensor separation in terms of distance alone is not sufficient , but also the specific tissue conduction properties and their relative dimensions must be taken into account ( ii ) for rf signals , we only need to avoid concurrent signal reception from two or more sources at the receiver that results in detection errors .",
    "instead in the gc - ibn we need to prevent constructive signal combination at any intermediate point that goes beyond permissible limits for tissue safety .",
    "( iii ) the relative depths at which the implants are located must be considered in clustering to ensure that the harder - to - reach implants have proportionally longer lifetime .",
    "( iv ) there is no redundancy among nodes within the ibn , and hence , every node is important , and vital to the application .",
    "( v ) the links between the implants and the external relays exhibit highly asymmetric behavior between uplink and downlink directions .",
    "( vi ) finally , there are varying traffic needs between different implants served by the same relay , which may necessitate proximity considerations for certain nodes .",
    "@xmath8 * contributions .",
    "* the main contributions of this work are :    \\1 .",
    "we propose the first theoretical clustering framework that provides clear guidelines for placing on - skin relay nodes for embedded implants , while considering the heterogeneous composition and 3-d characteristics of human tissue channels .",
    "we derive acceptable gc - ibn link length distribution that minimizes transmission power for all the nodes , as well as the number of relays , while meeting application demands .",
    "this ensures a balanced energy consumption among all the nodes .",
    "we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering framework using detailed simulation models and experimental studies involving porcine tissue .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ bg ] summarizes the related contributions .",
    "[ sec : model ] introduces our gc - ibn system model .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] explains our 2-phase clustering framework , which is then analyzed and evaluated in sec.[sec : eval ] .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "the comparatively short links in gc - ibn ( @xmath12  @xcite ) and the varying body channels require dynamic cluster formation .",
    "however , analyzing all possible solutions for relay placement is an np - hard problem , and the short time - scales suggest the use of heuristic approaches .",
    "we further discuss additional design considerations for the clustering problem .",
    "* clustering constraints : * equitable distribution of energy within classical wsns is achieved by rotating the role of the cluster head ( analogous to relay node , in our case )  @xcite .",
    "the gc - ibn is constrained to have the relay on the skin - surface , and hence the implanted nodes are no longer candidates for role switching . in the general case ,",
    "wsn protocols assume the bulk of traffic flows in a single direction ( i.e. , transmit - only sensors and receive - only sink ) , while a typical gc - ibn with sensors and actuators involve bidirectional traffic . moreover , as the gc - ibn comprises of non - redundant implants , the network is considered operational until the first implant runs out of energy .",
    "this is in contrast to the wsn scenario , where the cluster remains useful as long as a reduced subset of sensors is available .    *",
    "3-d propagation : * traditional 3d clustering approaches like  @xcite handle all three dimensions equally .",
    "however , with the gc transmitter on surface , a receiver at tissue depth ( eg . , @xmath10 & @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) receives a stronger signal than a receiver on the skin surface at the same distance ( eg . , @xmath10 & @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) owing to the superior conducting properties of the inner tissues .",
    "straightforward application of techniques , such as k - means clustering that have been applied to terrestrial wsns , do not account for the different propagation paths .",
    "* relay positioning constrains : * classical wsns have uniform distribution of nodes , which also results in spread of cluster heads throughout the area under study  @xcite .",
    "however , implant locations are influenced by medical applications , and these may result in small pockets of deployment .",
    "thus , the distribution of the relay points in this case is non - uniform .",
    "moreover , relays must forward information among themselves , serving as a conduit for messages among the sensors , instead of direct communication between multiple implant pairs ( e.g. , @xmath11 and @xmath10 forward information , instead of @xmath0 and @xmath14 directly ) .",
    "this ensures lower energy consumption for the implants , but imposes constraints on the number of nodes connected to relays",
    ". finally , earlier works on relay positioning for on - surface nodes are not suitable for implants  @xcite , which makes the current problem scenario novel .",
    "one of the relay nodes function as the data sink , with rf wireless connectivity to transfer the obtained data to an external monitor ( @xmath11 in fig.[fig : intro ] ) .",
    "the other relays , apart from connecting the implants , forward the aggregated and partially processed data towards the sink , forming a two - tier hierarchical architecture .",
    "we limit this work to optimize the intra - cluster topology that includes choosing the nodes participating in each cluster and estimating the relay position .",
    "we provide an overview of the clustering goals in this section , with the variables listed in table i.    we assume a set @xmath15 of iid nodes embedded as implants in the body , or placed on the body surface , as shown in fig.[fig : intro ] .",
    "the position of a node @xmath16 is represented by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the tissue where @xmath16 in present , and @xmath19 represents the three dimensional coordinates .",
    "specifically , @xmath20 denotes the depth at which the node @xmath16 is present in the tissue @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the thickness of chosen tissue layer .",
    "note that we limit this work to skin and muscle tissues , for the purpose of ease of explanation and given that implants are not generally embedded in fat or bone , but the steps can easily be extended to include fat or bone tissues .",
    "the primary goal of clustering is to place the relay closer to implants ( for short links ) as well as to connect more nodes to the relay , even from neighboring clusters ( cluster merging ) so as to reduce the number of relays required ( eg .",
    ", as illustrated in clusters @xmath23 in fig.[fig:2nd](b ) ) .",
    "if the number of nodes exceeds the relay capacity ( defined below ) , an additional relay is assigned to handle the overload situation ( refer @xmath24 in fig.[fig:2nd](b ) ) .",
    "intuitively , no relays are assigned to regions with no nodes ( refer @xmath25 in fig.[fig:2nd](b ) ) .",
    "an isolated node that can not be reached from existing relays should be allocated to a dedicated relay ( similar to @xmath26 in fig.[fig:2nd](b ) ) .",
    "the number of nodes in a cluster @xmath27 is denoted as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes cardinality .",
    "@xmath30 is number of clusters that contains @xmath31 implants and @xmath32 surface nodes .",
    "the relay @xmath33 assigned for cluster @xmath34 is on the skin surface at @xmath35 , depth ( @xmath36 ) and is reachable from all the @xmath37 nodes through single - hop transmission .",
    "fig.[fig:2nd ] shows the scenario where the gc - ibn clusters extend over multiple tissues .",
    "we avoid representing the length of the link ( @xmath38 ) between the implant @xmath16 and relay @xmath33 purely in terms of euclidean distance , considering the presence of heterogeneous tissues between the surface relay and the muscle implant ( for surface nodes , the euclidean assumption still holds ) . instead , we approximate the length of the link to be homogeneously co - planar in muscle with the relay assumed to be vertically below the surface containing @xmath35 , and on the plane of the implant in the muscle at @xmath39 .",

    "( s - s ) scenario , let @xmath50 be the function mapping the euclidean link length to the channel gain between them using the circuit based channel model built with the tissue electrical properties .",
    "these two nodes can be the on - skin sensor and the relay ( eg . , @xmath1 & @xmath10 in fig.[fig : intro ] ) , or between two relays ( eg .",
    ", @xmath11 & @xmath10 in fig.[fig : intro ] ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath51 maps the approximated implant - relay link length to the multi - tissue channel gain , given the path traverses muscle to skin ( m - s ) .",
    "we achieve this by adding the skin and fat impedance to that of the muscle at @xmath39 to obtain the heterogeneous m - s path gain .",
    "functions @xmath52 have been earlier developed in  @xcite , which we use in this work . in fig.[fig : intro ] , @xmath1 is connected to @xmath10 through the s - s path , while the implants @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath3 communicate with @xmath10 via the m - s path .    as the first step towards our proposed heuristic clustering scheme , we establish the upper and lower bounds on the transmit power that are feasible , as this directly impacts the separation distance .",
    "@xmath8 _ lower bound on pt : _ the bit error rate must remain below the application demands .",
    "this can be achieved by ensuring the channel snr remains above the desired snr ( @xmath53 ) by controlling the minimum required transmit power @xmath54 as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gaussian noise p.s.d in @xmath57 path with zero mean , and @xmath58 is the receiver bandwidth .",

    "will also be lower , indicating the possibility of extended @xmath64 . with an initial energy store of @xmath69 for the battery life to extend beyond @xmath64",
    ", the following condition should be satisfied : @xmath70 using ( [ eqn : ptmax ] ) , ( [ eqn : eh ] ) and ( [ cond : hpwithe ] ) , the upper bound on @xmath60 for the given @xmath64 and @xmath71 can now be obtained as : @xmath72    @xmath8 _ bounds on @xmath73 : _ the maximum link distance that offers the desired node lifetime , snr and ber , without exceeding @xmath71 is the threshold length , @xmath74 of node @xmath16 , and estimated as : @xmath75 where , @xmath76 & @xmath77 are the inverse functions of @xmath50 & @xmath51 along the s - s and m - s paths respectively , providing the length of the link that offers the gain @xmath78 for @xmath61 .",
    "we assume the threshold link length along s - s path , @xmath79within the cluster as constant as the surface nodes need not be that constrained in terms of energy replenishment .",
    "however , the threshold link length of the m - s path , @xmath80 concerning the implants of a cluster vary in @xmath81 $ ] as implants with long life require shorter links and vice - verse . hence both singlehop and reliable communication from @xmath16 to @xmath33 is feasible if @xmath82    @xmath8 _ cluster capacity limit : _ [ cluster_capactiy ] the overall bandwidth requirement of a cluster can not exceed the capacity ( @xmath83 ) of its outgoing link that connects @xmath33 to the next hop surface relay or sink .",
    "hence , @xmath34 is restricted to the set of nodes with the sum of required bandwidth less than @xmath83 .",
    "this bounds @xmath34 as follows : @xmath84      given the choice of tissues where the implants are present , the path - loss and energy cost differ .",
    "in addition , the bandwidth requirements of the nodes are also not uniform ( eg . , sensors may require higher uplink bandwidth while actuator may need higher downlink bandwidth ) . to address this scenario , we capture the various heterogeneity factors in a single - valued _ weight _ metric .",
    "@xmath8 _ heterogeneity from embedded tissue ( @xmath85 ) : _ surface nodes ( @xmath86 ) incur low energy - conservation costs ( @xmath87 ) as they are on the skin , hence easily accessible .",
    "implants ( @xmath88 ) incur a higher cost per unit of energy spent ( @xmath89 ) as they require invasive procedures for energy replenishment . for extended cluster lifetimes ,",
    "the overall energy consumption of implants is to be minimized as @xmath90 or @xmath91 for @xmath92 implants and @xmath32 surface nodes .",
    "hence @xmath38 is to be weighed based on @xmath93 to ensure optimal clustering .",
    "@xmath8 _ heterogeneity from data rate ( @xmath94 ) : _ the difference in @xmath94 among the cluster nodes suggests that nodes with higher data rates require longer duty cycles and consume more energy . for instance , assuming @xmath95 & @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 as respective required data rates , @xmath99 for some constant @xmath100 .",
    "this results in an undesirable variation in @xmath60 , @xmath101 . to ensure equitable energy costs throughout the network with varying @xmath94 , the on - skin",
    "relay should be ideally moved closer to the node with higher @xmath94 ( i.e. , closer to node @xmath102 in ( [ condn : eta ] ) ) to compensate the additional @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) required .",

    "we perform the nearest neighbor based iterative cluster optimization ( nico ) until the achieved clustering is deemed optimal . thus , through this approach , the quantity , size and position of the clusters are iteratively optimized for energy efficiency under performance constraints .      in this phase , we use definitive cuboid grid based clustering as ( i ) it identifies and connects outliers while no nodes are left under - classified , a common possibility among density based approaches  @xcite , and ( ii)partitioning the node space into finite number of cuboids requires fixed number of executions that depends only on the number of cuboids irrespective of @xmath124 .",
    "the cuboids are preferred over the spheres as the grid size is different in the third spatial dimension ( i.e. , height varies ) .",

    "grid size estimation : _ larger clusters ( i.e. , with higher @xmath125 ) require longer average link lengths , consuming more @xmath103 , while smaller clusters increase the number of clusters @xmath30 .",
