    "the process @xmath84 is suppressed by a small coupling , while @xmath85 is one  loop suppressed . additionally , the technipions have no tree level couplings to @xmath1 or @xmath2 , negating the usual higgs boson production modes at lepton colliders",

    "the sm @xmath88 cross section is about 20 pb , and it is problematic whether an excess of events with heavy flavor can be observed above the backgrounds ( because of tc2 , such a light charged technipion is not constrained by top quark decays ) .",

    " mediated processes have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . unlike the technipions",
    ", the technirho and techniomega can have substantial mixing with the sm gauge bosons , and can be produced with electroweak strength .",
    "the mixing between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the fine structure constant and @xmath94 is the technirho coupling , which is fixed in the tcsm by scaling the ordinary rho coupling by @xmath95 ( @xmath96 in this analysis ) .",
    "the full expression for the mixing depends also on the masses and widths of the technivectors .",
    "in addition , @xmath97 and @xmath98 mixing is proportional to @xmath99 .    from the discussion of decay rates above",
    ", the technirho and techniomega are also expected to be narrow , which naively reduces the reach of a lepton collider to regions where the center  of  mass energy is close to the resonance mass .",
    "however , the resonances are not of the simple , breit ",
    "wigner form , and the effects of mixing can be seen at lower energies than a few total widths from the resonance mass . on resonance , the production cross sections are substantial ( @xmath100(nb ) strength for the models considered here ) , and a tail may be visible even if the nominal mass of the resonance is @xmath0 gev _ above _ the collider energy .",
    "if the resonance mass is substantially _ below _ the center  of  mass energy , then the resonance is produced in radiative return events , and should be easily excluded  @xcite .",
    "to estimate the prospects for observing technivectors at lep2 , we have to fix all of the tcsm parameters .",
    "the remaining important parameters are the mass splittings between the vectors and scalars @xmath101 , the technipion mixing angle @xmath102 , and the sum technifermion charge @xmath99 .",
    "the choices of model parameters are outlined in table 1 .",

    "the charge @xmath99 is large , so that @xmath4 has a large branching ratio to @xmath82 and @xmath75 final states and a large @xmath97 and @xmath98 mixing .",
    "model 2 has a lighter @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath108 , so that the @xmath109 coupling and @xmath110 mixing vanishes .",
    "model 3 has a small mass splitting @xmath111 , so that @xmath112 is forbidden on  shell , and @xmath113 , which yields similar @xmath114 and @xmath110 mixing .",

    "model 6 is similar to model 5 , but @xmath116 is allowed on  shell .",
    "finally , models 7 and 8 have light technipions , with unsuppressed couplings to @xmath115 and @xmath117 , respectively , but @xmath108 to suppress @xmath109 couplings and @xmath110 mixing .",

    "last column of table 1 .",
    "the final column shows the symbols used in the figures to denote the models 18 .",
    "we concentrate on four basic signatures . the first two , the drell  yan production of @xmath118 and @xmath115 pair production , contain only sm particles in the final state .",
    "the last two contain either two technipions or a technipion and an electroweak gauge boson .      as explained above , the technirho and techniomega couple to final states containing fermion pairs through mixing with @xmath119 and @xmath2 bosons .",
    "we consider the the @xmath118 final state here , since this avoids the complication of bhabha scattering .",
    "the expected cross sections for the various models as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath6 is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is worth noting the sensitivity to resonances with pole masses above the energy @xmath6 , despite the fact that the resonances are narrow .",
    "in particular , model 1 , with @xmath120 gev and @xmath121 gev , has @xmath122 at @xmath123 gev in the @xmath118 final state , where @xmath124 is the deviation from the standard model cross section times the integrated luminosity , and @xmath125 is the expected number of standard model events .",
    "the large values for @xmath126 ( even sizeable 50 gev from the resonance peak ) is due to the large charge @xmath127 in this model .",
    "if @xmath113 ( @xmath128 ) , then @xmath129 with all other parameters fixed .",
    "likewise , for @xmath108 , which is the limit that the @xmath109 coupling and @xmath110 mixing vanishes , we have @xmath130 .",
    "far from the resonance peak , measurements of such variations in the overall rate will have important systematic as well as statistical errors , so it is important to have a verification of an effect . because of the sm quantum numbers ( and the energy range considered ) , there is more sensitivity in the lepton pair final state than in the quark pair , and , for the same set of parameters , the effect in the @xmath63 final state is roughly half of that in the @xmath118 one .",
    "there is a also difference in the angular distribution of the decay products because of the interference between the various resonances , but this is not dramatic .",
    "the general feature that the cross section decreases before increasing on the resonance is true even for @xmath131 , since the @xmath132 and @xmath133 components of the inverse propagator are quadratic in @xmath99 .",
    "the only models that do not demonstrate a significant effect in the fermion pair final state are those where the technirho is fairly wide and @xmath108 , so that the @xmath110 mixing vanishes ( models 7 and 8) . final state . ] in these cases , a substantial signal is expected in the @xmath3mediated @xmath115 or @xmath117 channels .      if @xmath134 , the @xmath3 coupling to the @xmath115 final state can be important .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ wpwm ] , where only models that yield a visible signal are shown .",
    "the sm prediction for the @xmath88 cross section is shown for reference .",
    "model 4 , with @xmath135 , has @xmath136 at @xmath137 gev , and model 8 has a similar behavior .",
    "( note , in this figure , the tcsm signal should be added to the standard model component . )",
    "the technirho is fairly wide once the @xmath115 channel is unsuppressed , but there is no theoretical motivation for @xmath134 . on the other hand , there is no realistic theory , yet , so we present these results for completeness .",
    "the feature around @xmath86 gev in model 4 arises from complicated @xmath114 interference .",
    "when @xmath138 , the increase in cross section is limited to a region of several gev around the peak position , since the technirho is much narrower . clearly , on or near the peak , the effect is a striking increase in the total @xmath88 production cross section .",
    "otherwise , the signature is a moderate excess of @xmath115 events on a potentially large background .",
    "if the technipion is light enough , the @xmath3 coupling to @xmath140 and @xmath117 as @xmath141 is complementary to the @xmath115 coupling when @xmath134 .",
    "this is illustrated by comparing model 7 in fig .",
    "[ wtp ] to model 8 in fig .",
    "[ wpwm ] , which have large signals in one or the other channel .",
    "both models yield the same @xmath142 at @xmath143 gev in their respective channels .",
    "technirho and techniomega couplings to a transverse @xmath1 boson and @xmath49 also arise , but typically at reduced rates compared to @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath144 decays preferentially to heavy flavor , @xmath140 or @xmath145 production will produce an excess of @xmath146 or @xmath147 and @xmath148tagged events in the total @xmath88 data sample .",
    "the experimental sensitivity will be better if @xmath50 is sufficiently different from @xmath149 .",
    "note that the off  resonance production rate for @xmath145 is generally much larger than the usual charged higgs boson pair production rate discussed earlier .      for @xmath151 , a significant @xmath150 signature can arise .",
    "@xmath152 production , while possible , is never important relative to @xmath73 from phase space considerations .",
    "the @xmath4 contribution to @xmath73 can be enhanced significantly if @xmath99 is large , since the @xmath110 mixing is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "the expected signal rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ gampi ] for the various models .",
    "we have not attempted to estimate the backgrounds , which may be prodigious if @xmath153 . however",
    ", if @xmath154 is sufficiently different from @xmath155 , an off  resonance signal may be observable .",
    "the expected final states are @xmath156 , @xmath157 or @xmath158 . on resonance",
    ", the @xmath73 production rate can be @xmath100(100 pb ) or larger , and there is still some rate off resonance even when the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are narrow .",
    "model 1 ( with @xmath127 ) yields a raw event rate of @xmath159 pb at @xmath137 gev .",
    "this drops to @xmath160 pb if @xmath113 , and @xmath161 pb for @xmath108 .",
    "these three choices for @xmath99 represent @xmath4 domination , equal @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions , and @xmath3 domination .",
    "model 5 , which has @xmath162 and lighter @xmath3 and @xmath4 , has a raw event rate of @xmath163 pb .",
    "we have presented examples of how several models of low  scale technicolor , in the framework of the tcsm , would manifest themselves at a lepton collider operating near @xmath86 gev .",
    "these can be used to guide searches at lep2 to discover or constrain tcsm models .",
    "the actual limits will depend on the collider energy , the amount of delivered luminosity , and the sm backgrounds in each channel . for reference , it is quite possible that lep2 will operate at @xmath86 gev , with 200 pb@xmath164 of data delivered to each experiment . in this case , each experiment will be sensitive to cross sections near 15 fb in channels which are relatively background free .",
    "the production rates shown have no event selection cuts and no effects of initial state radiation . a dedicated analysis at the particle ",
    "level is now under way @xcite based on the pythia event generator  @xcite .",
    "the details of how to study the tcsm using pythia are included in the appendix . here",
    ", we review the results of our parton  level study .    on or near resonance",
    ", there are substantial signals of technirho and techniomega production in one or more final states .",
    "the typical width of the @xmath3 considered is a few tenths to a few gev , while the @xmath4 ranged from exceedingly narrow up to a few tenths of a gev . when @xmath134 , the decays @xmath106 are unsuppressed .",
    "likewise , when @xmath141 , but @xmath116 is kinematically allowed , a complementary signature arises in the @xmath117 final state , where @xmath49 decays predominantly to heavy flavor . for intermediate values of @xmath165",
    ", decays to @xmath140 will occur when kinematically allowed .",
    "also , there can be signals in @xmath75 or @xmath73 final states .",
    "these signatures should be unmistakable , since the on  resonance cross sections can be of @xmath100(nb ) .",
    "for the same reason , we expect that technivectors with mass significantly below the center  of  mass energy can be easily excluded by searching for radiative return events , but this requires a detailed study @xcite .",
    "because of the mixing between the technivector mesons and the electroweak gauge bosons , signatures are not limited to be near the resonance peak .",
    "in particular , the presence of the @xmath3 or @xmath4 may be inferred from a significant decrease in the @xmath118 rate , unless the @xmath110 mixing is small or the @xmath3 has a width of several gev .",
    "the @xmath63 final state would yield a similar effect , but at only about 1/2 the magnitude . also , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 can mediate the @xmath73 final state , which may be observable above backgrounds , provided that @xmath50 is far enough from @xmath155 .",
    "event rates of .18 pb are possible at 30 gev below the resonance peak in the models considered here , depending on the technipion mass , the technifermion charge @xmath99 , and the technipion mixing angle @xmath102 .",
    "even rates closer to the resonance are much larger",
    ".    the choices of tcsm parameters used in this analysis were motivated by the beam energy of lep2 .",
    "however , several technicolor  motivated analyses have emerged based on the run i data sets at the tevatron  @xcite that constrain the properties of the color  singlet technirho and techniomega . in general , the technivector masses of the models considered here are beyond the sensitivity of these analyses , except for the techniomega search , which may exclude the models with large @xmath127 at the 90% c.l . therefore , it is expected that lep2 can set stronger limits than run i at the tevatron for @xmath166 and @xmath167 signatures for certain choices of tcsm parameters .    in conclusion , unless the technipion masses are fairly light compared to the technivector masses ( which is not expected due to the enhancement of the hard technifermion masses ) , or the technipion mixing angle @xmath134 ( which is not expected due to the large number of technifermion doublets required in a model with a running coupling ) , technivector  mediated @xmath118 and @xmath150 final states can be studied at lep2 to discover or constrain simple models of technicolor at collider energies substantially below the technivector masses .",
    "the actual limit will depend on a detailed background analysis , but the models studied here yield substantial effects at @xmath0 gev below @xmath168 .",
    "the technirho alone can still produce visible effects in these channels , or ( 1 ) the @xmath169 final states , if kinematically allowed , ( 2 ) the @xmath115 final state , if @xmath134 , or ( 3 ) the @xmath117 final state , if @xmath170 and the technipion is light .",
