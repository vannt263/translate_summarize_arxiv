    "the second most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds , co , has a rich and long observational history in the radio , near - infrared , and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) regimes .",
    "this sequence of spectral windows provides a view of pure - rotational and rotational - vibrational transitions among ground - state ( @xmath1 ) levels , and electronic transitions between the @xmath2 state and the first excited singlet state , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "deeper into the fuv , additional prominent dipole - allowed bands of co appear , involving the rydberg states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",

    "* hereafter f01 ) , and of the _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) band at 1076   were conducted with the _ copernicus _ satellite with a spectral resolution ( @xmath8 ) of 20,000 @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite also reported _ copernicus _ data on the _ b@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) band at 1150  .",
    "this band is only dipole - allowed band other than the _ a@xmath0x _ bands that has been fully resolved into individual rotational lines ",
    "see the ghrs spectrum from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) in figure 5 of @xcite",
    ". another uv space mission following _ copernicus _ that detected the _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) band was the _ orbiting and retrievable far and extreme ultraviolet spectrometer _ ( _ orfeus _ ) , albeit at the more modest resolution of @xmath8 = 3,000 @xcite .    in 1999 , _ fuse _ was launched , covering the spectral range of 905@xmath01187   at the same resolution as that of _ copernicus _ @xcite .",
    "in addition to covering the _ b@xmath0x _ , _ c@xmath0x _ , and _",
    "e@xmath0x _ bands , _ fuse _ should be able to detect a significant number of bluer rydberg bands below 1075  .",
    "these are the signatures of high - lying states of co that converge onto electronic states in co@xmath9 .",
    "the rydberg states have an important role in the photodissociation of co , which occurs via line absorption of fuv photons from the ground state , followed by predissociation into atomic c and o. @xcite mapped 46 bands between 885@xmath01099  , i.e. , to the blue of the _ b@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) and ( 1@xmath00 ) bands . of these",
    ", 43 bands are predissociating , a fact that enabled @xcite to revise the rate of co photodissociation upward by a factor of 20 .",
    "not only was co found to be more readily destroyed when exposed to the uv field , but the nature of line absorption leads to strong self shielding of this molecule as its column density increases into a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "self shielding limits the effectiveness of photodissociation .",
    "therefore , any revisions to @xmath10-values for the rydberg bands are an important input for theoretical models of the interstellar co abundance .    these bands have been studied in the laboratory .",
    "line lists and band constants were presented by @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e91 ) , and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that optical depth effects hindered reliable measurements of @xmath10-values for many of these bands , which are invariably strong .",
    "later investigations at high resolution and low temperature ( 20 k ) were reported by stark , yoshino , and collaborators ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in a recent study f01 measured laboratory @xmath10-values for five bands involving the b , c , and e states and found that the @xmath10-values were larger than those in e91 by factors between 1.08 ( a negligible difference ) and 1.99 ( a significant one ) .",
    "clearly , there is a need to extend the re - evaluations to other rydberg bands .",
    "_ fuse _ spectra turn out to be complementary to the laboratory measurements , since they allow internally self - consistent @xmath10-values to be extracted from interstellar co bands . here",
    "we present the interstellar results for co toward , including eight rydberg bands that are detected in the ism for the first time .",
    "_ fuse _ observations of hd203374a were obtained on 2001 august 2 , as part of the _ fuse _ guest investigator program b030 .",
    "the target , which is a member of the cep ob2 association , is a b0 iv star with a reddening of @xmath11 = 0.6 mag .",
    "thirty four sub - exposures were secured in the hist ( spectral image ) mode , totaling 18,653 s. all sub - exposures were co - added and calibrated using the calfuse software ( version 2.4 ) .",
    "the data were then re - binned by a factor of four to yield two pixels per nominal resolution element ( 0.05  ) .",
    "the binned pixels are of higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) thanks to the large number of sub - exposures , which effectively diluted the fixed pattern noise of _",
    "scattered light was successfully corrected in the calfuse processing , with the opaque flat cores of h@xmath12 lines found to be well below the 1% normalized flux level .",
    "most of the _ fuse _ spectral range is covered by two ( sometimes three ) independent detector segments , except for the 1017@xmath01075   region , where four segments are available .",
    "each of the co bands was modeled in each individual segment , as well as in the final co - added spectrum from all available segments .",
    "the spectral resolution varies between detectors : @xmath8 = 15,000 for bands in the sic channels and 19,000 in the lif ones .",
    "the only band with equal contributions from both types , _ e@xmath0x _ ( 1@xmath00 ) , was modeled with @xmath8 = 17,000 .",
    "the final co - added spectra that become input for our synthesis code , ismod , have a s / n ratio of 80 to 100 per pixel .",
    "ismod fits each rotational line with a voigt profile whose gaussian component is based on the doppler broadening parameter , and whose lorentzian part is controlled by the inverse lifetime as determined by radiative decay and predissociation .",
    "upper level lifetimes , which were treated as fixed input , were gathered from e91 , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the code then minimizes the root - mean - square residuals between the data and a model that incorporates freely - varying parameters , using shrinking step sizes down to 10@xmath13 of a parameter s value .",
    "although ismod was first used to synthesize co bands in _ hst _ spectra , we recently modified it to synthesize h@xmath12 bands seen by _",
    "this new derivative of ismod was essential for the initial step of dividing out the h@xmath12 lines before the blended co bands could be recovered and then modeled successfully .",
    "as a prelude to co analysis , a model of the h@xmath12 gas toward hd203374a was derived .",
    "it shows a total h@xmath12 column density of 5.10 ( @xmath14 0.05 ) @xmath15 10@xmath16 @xmath17 and a kinetic temperature ( or @xmath18 of h@xmath12 ) of 74.5 @xmath14 1.5 k. this model was varied by small steps to account for _ fuse _ spectral changes in various wavelength regions and was then divided into co spectral cuts as a means of deblending the rydberg bands .",
    "each co band involves r , p , and for upper @xmath19 states q transitions from four significantly populated rotational levels ( @xmath20@xmath21 @xmath22 3 ) in the ground state .",
    "bands that involve an upper @xmath23 state , e.g. , _ b@xmath0x _ ( 1@xmath00 ) and _ k@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , resemble a blended double absorption profile from their p and r branches ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "those that involve a @xmath19 state , such as _ e@xmath0x _ ( 1@xmath00 ) and _ w@xmath0x _ ( 2@xmath00 ) , have a q branch containing a pileup of lines between the r and p branches , and thus appear as a single feature .",
    "while _ fuse _ spectra can not resolve individual rotational lines , a splitting of each transition into four cloud components , as described below , is required to synthesize the bands in an adequate manner .",
    "the derivation of @xmath10-values for optically - thick co bands requires that both the total co column density , @xmath24(co ) , and the cloud structure are known .",
    "five high - resolution ( @xmath8 = 140,000 after @xmath152 binning ) spectral cuts from _",
    "data toward hd203374a were kindly supplied to us by e. jenkins .",
    "these include five consecutive _",
    "a@xmath0x _ bands of co , from ( 7@xmath00 ) at 1344   to ( 11@xmath00 ) at 1263  , for which accurately known @xmath10-values are available @xcite . although the weaker bands are adequate for @xmath24(co ) derivations , we also incorporated the strong _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) band from our _ fuse _ data as a calibrator of this analysis .",
    "such a strong band is especially sensitive to variables that control the optical depth , i.e. , the position , fraction , and width of individual clouds , as well as the excitation temperature ( @xmath25 ) of ground rotational levels .",
    "together with the _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) band , the run of bands covers a range of 2.8 orders of magnitude in @xmath10-value , thereby being able to accommodate any other fuv band as part of a robust model fit .",
    "note that _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) is a bit problematic , owing to a blending of its p branch with the strong interstellar line of at 1088.06   @xcite .",
    "however , the important benefit of using this band was realized by limiting model fitting to its r branch .",
    "our synthesis was based on the four - component cloud structure seen in high - resolution ( @xmath8 = 200,000 ) ch spectra at visible wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the structure was kept fixed during h@xmath12 synthesis , but was allowed to vary for the high - resolution co fits . the resulting relative velocity ( in km s@xmath26 ) ,",
    "fractional strength , and doppler width ( @xmath27-value = @xmath28(fwhm)/1.665 , in km s@xmath26 ) are ( 0.0 , 0.44 , 0.77 ) , ( @xmath03.6 , 0.51 , 0.54 ) , ( @xmath07.3 , 0.02 , 0.59 ) , and ( @xmath011.4 , 0.03 , 0.54 ) .",
    "jointly , these four components give a total @xmath24(co ) of 2.41 ( @xmath14 0.24 ) @xmath15 10@xmath29 @xmath17 in front of hd203374a . the fitted equivalent widths ( @xmath30 ) for the _ a@xmath0x _ ( 7@xmath00 ) to ( 11@xmath00 ) bands are 50.9 @xmath14 0.8 , 36.3 @xmath14 0.5 , 22.6 @xmath14 0.6 , 11.7 @xmath14 0.5 , and 5.6 @xmath14 0.7 m , respectively .",
    "the @xmath30 for the _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) band is 139 @xmath14 13 m .",
    "modeled values of @xmath25 are 3.2 , 3.5 , and 5.0 k for the first three rotational levels , relative to @xmath20@xmath21 = 0 . as is the case along previously studied lines of sight , co - bearing cloud components have the narrowest line widths among either atomic or molecular species , as well as some of the lowest @xmath25 values . at first glance",
    "it would seem that the last two components , which have fractional strengths of @xmath22 3% , are too weak to be of significance in the fit .",
    "however , for bands with large @xmath10-values , the strongest components are very optically thick , allowing the weaker components to determine band profile shapes .    following the simultaneous fit of the six bands , we re - fitted each of them separately in order to gauge the associated uncertainties .",
    "using the newly derived cloud structure and @xmath25 , individual @xmath24(co ) values were up to 11% away from their average .",
    "therefore , @xmath24(co ) toward hd203347a is uncertain by @xmath3110% .",
    "additional testing is available through comparison of three other bands studied by f01 .",
    "_ b@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) has fitted @xmath30 = 50 @xmath14 3 mand @xmath10-value = 5.7 ( @xmath14 0.9 ) @xmath15 10@xmath32 , and _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) has fitted values of 97 @xmath14 2 m  and 63 ( @xmath14 7 ) @xmath15 10@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the values for _ b@xmath0x _ ( 1@xmath00 ) , which is a first ism detection , are presented in table 1 .",
    "the corresponding deviations from the @xmath10-values of f01 are @xmath015% , @xmath08% , and + 33% , respectively , thus averaging about @xmath14 2@xmath33 relative to our uncertainty for @xmath24(co ) . with uncertainties of 10% for the _ a@xmath0x _ bands ( chan et al .",
    "1993 ) and 13% for _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) ( f01 ) , the absolute 1@xmath33 uncertainties on our @xmath10-values are close to 15% .",
    "seven additional rydberg bands farther into the fuv , which were not studied by f01 , are seen in our _ fuse _ spectra ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) . of these , _ k@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , _ w@xmath0x _",
    "( 1@xmath00 ) , and _ w@xmath0x _",
    "( 2@xmath00 ) are least affected by blending with h@xmath12 lines .",
    "indeed , these three bands have appreciable contributions to the photodissociation rate of interstellar co , as can be seen in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "since @xmath24(co ) is now known , self - consistent @xmath10-values for all _ fuse _ bands can be derived . ratios of interstellar @xmath10-value to that of e91 are 1.27 @xmath14 0.24 and 1.75 @xmath14 0.26 for _ b@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) and _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , respectively . together with the @xmath10-value ratios given in table 1 , seven bands out of 10 are stronger by factors between 1.07 and 1.75 relative to e91 , although most of these factors are smaller than their 1@xmath33 uncertainties .",
    "the three bands with the most significant factors are _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , _ k@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , and _ b@xmath0x _",
    "( 1@xmath00 ) , which have @xmath10-value ratios of 1.75 @xmath14 0.26 ( deviating by 2.9@xmath33 ) , 1.48 @xmath14 0.24 ( 2.0@xmath33 ) , and 1.47 @xmath14 0.21 ( 2.2@xmath33 ) , respectively . for the weakest of these bands ,",
    "_ e@xmath0x _",
    "( 1@xmath00 ) , most determinations are consistent with an @xmath10-value of @xmath313.5 @xmath15 10@xmath32 .",
    "the new interstellar band @xmath10-values confirm the conclusions of f01 , namely , that the older @xmath10-values in e91 are too small for moderately - strong to strong bands .",
    "however , the average correction for the bands to the blue of _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) is not as large as the one derived from the redder bands of f01 , which was dominated by the strongest bands of co , _ c@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) and _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) .",
    "therefore , the trend of larger corrections for stronger bands from f01 is also confirmed .",
    "rotational lines of rydberg bands below @xmath311000   tend to have larger natural widths owing to level lifetimes that are predominantly shorter than @xmath3110@xmath34 s , whereas above @xmath311000  longer lifetimes are encountered .",
    "the larger natural widths result in smaller optical depths at line centers , thus alleviating the line saturation more readily associated with redder bands of similar oscillator strength .",
    "this may explain why interstellar @xmath10-values agree better with synchrotron absorption results for bands below 970  .",
    "there is one exception to this trend . the band _",
    "( 1@xmath00 ) has a ratio of 0.81 @xmath14 0.12 ( 1.6@xmath33 ) relative to eidelsberg et al.s ( 1991 ) result .",
    "as shown in table 1 , the 20 k result from @xcite is somewhat smaller than ours .",
    "two earlier studies found that _",
    "( 1@xmath00 ) is weaker than _ l@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , a band only 0.6   to the blue of _ l@xmath35x _ ( 1@xmath00 ) , and blended with it at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the roles are reversed in e91 , with _ l@xmath35x _ ( 1@xmath00 ) being the stronger band , thus prompting us to suspect some contamination from _ l@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) .",
    "note that the continuum under this interstellar band had to be corrected by 10% owing to unidentified ( probably stellar ) absorption . without this correction ,",
    "the @xmath10-value would be 1.16 @xmath14 0.16 relative to e91 .    the band",
    "_ i@xmath35x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) is a special case .",
    "initial inspection showed that only a weak feature in the _ fuse _ spectra coincided with the e91 position of the band , while a much larger feature to the blue could not be identified . in the laboratory , this band is very diffuse , and shows at least three intensity peaks in its room - temperature profile , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 1 ) .",
    "such a structure is in conflict with the e91 tabulation that provides two branches ( r and p ) and the assignment @xmath36 for this band .",
    "we suspected that _ i@xmath35x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) suffers from strong perturbations , or that it may be blended with another , hitherto unaccounted for , co band .",
    "a laboratory spectrum acquired at 80 k ( m. eidelsberg 2003 , private communication ) more clearly defines the r and p branches of _ i@xmath35x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , leading to a shift of @xmath00.243   in line positions relative to e91 .",
    "since this shift leads to excellent agreement with the larger feature in the _ fuse _ spectra , we adopted this shift in our synthesis of the band , yielding the @xmath10-value given in table 1 .",
    "the agreement with laboratory results is excellent .",
    "this is the only case were we did allow the natural width of the lines to vary , owing to the extremely diffuse nature of the band .",
    "our fit of its wings resulted in a lifetime change from 10@xmath37 s ( e91 ) to 4.2 ( @xmath14 0.8 ) @xmath15 10@xmath38 s. for a complementary confirmation it would be highly desirable to obtain a new laboratory recording of this region at a very low @xmath25 .",
    "in this paper we showed that _ fuse _ spectra can be utilized to measure the rydberg bands of co by isolating them from the strong presence of h@xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the bands not totally obscured are precisely those that play the major role in co photodissociation .",
    "thus observations via _ fuse _ have a direct impact on detailed modeling of the co distribution in the ism .",
    "_ fuse _ can be turned into a reliable estimator of co abundance and conditions , provided the number of velocity components is available from high - resolution ground - based spectra of ch , or from _ hst_/stis data of co itself , i.e. , its _",
    "a@xmath0x _ bands .",
    "most of the interstellar results confirm the larger @xmath10-values of relatively strong rydberg bands of co reported in recent laboratory studies ( see f01 ) .",
    "interestingly , this is especially true for the _ b@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , _ e@xmath0x _ ( 0@xmath00 ) , and the first three bands in table 1 , but much less obvious for all bands below 970  , the result of diminishing lifetimes for bluer bands .",
    "overall , interstellar values show good agreement with laboratory @xmath10-values obtained at 20 k @xcite and with laser absorption spectroscopy at very high resolution @xcite .",
    "otherwise , room - temperature spectroscopy suffers from serious blending of bands , especially below @xmath311000  .    in an earlier paper @xcite we showed that the older theoretical models of @xcite and warin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reproduced either the observed isotopomeric ratios or the observed column densities of four co isotopomers , but a given model could not reproduce both quantities .",
    "the new results from co toward hd203374a and the recent laboratory determinations of band @xmath10-values provide evidence that co is more resilient to destruction by enhanced self shielding because larger @xmath10-values cause higher optical depths for individual lines .",
    "theoretical models of molecular clouds that explore kinematic aspects of the co photodissociation rate , e.g. , @xcite , will also be affected .",
    "the new @xmath10-values of rydberg bands in the fuv should be incorporated into the next generation of models to yield improved predictions of co abundance .",
