    "the ideal of antimatter can be traced back to the end of 1890s , when schuster discussed the possibility of the existence of antiatoms as well as antimatter solar system by hypothesis in his letter to nature magazine @xcite .",
    "however , the modern concept of antimatter is originated from the negative energy state solution of a quantum - mechanical equation , which was proposed by dirac in 1928 @xcite .",
    "two years later , chao found that the absorption coefficient of hard @xmath7-rays in heavy elements was much larger than that was to expected from the klein - nishima formula or any other @xcite .",
    "this `` abnormal '' absorption is in fact due to the production of the pair of electron and its anti - partner , so - called positron .",
    "therefore chao s experiment is the first indirect observation of the first anti - matter particle , namely positron , in the history .",
    "another two years later , anderson observed positron with a cloud chamber @xcite .",
    "antimatter nuclei such as @xmath2  , @xmath8  , @xmath3   have been widely studied in both cosmic rays @xcite and accelerator experiments @xcite for the purposes of dark matter exploration and the study of manmade matter such as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) respectively , since the observation of anti - proton ( @xmath1 ) @xcite in 1955 .",
    "the possibility of the anti - gravity behavior between matter and antimatter has been discussed somewhere else @xcite .",
    "the recent progress regard the observation of antihypertriton ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and antihelium-4 ( @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ) @xcite nucleus in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite reported by rhic - star experiment as well as the longtime confinement of antihydrogen atoms @xcite based on an antiproton decelerator facility by alpha collaboration have already created a lot of excitation in both of the nuclear and particle physics community .",
    "all of the measurements performed above have implications beyond the fields of their own .",
    "such as , the study of hypernucleus in heavy ion collisions is essential for the understanding of the interaction between nucleon and hyperon ( yn interaction ) , which plays an important role in the explanation of the structure of neutron star .",
    "furthermore , as we learned from heavy ion collisions , the production rate for @xmath5   produced by colliding the high energy cosmic rays with interstellar materials is too low to be observed .",
    "even one @xmath5   or heavier antinucleus observed in the cosmic rays should be a great hint of the existence of massive antimatter in the universe .",
    "finally , the successful trap of antihydrogen atoms leads to a precise test of the cpt symmetry law , as well as a measurement of the gravitational effects between antimatter and matter in the future .    in this article",
    ", we present a review of kinds of antimatter particles experimentally , based on the time schedule of their first time observations .",

    ", the longtime trap of antihydrogen atoms performed by alpha experiment is introduced . in the last section",
    ", we have a brief discussion on antimatter nuclei production mechanism .",
    "finally we give a simple summary and outlook .",
    "in 1930 , c. y. chao performed a few @xmath7-ray scattering experiments on different elements @xcite .",
    "@xmath7-rays from th c after being filtered through 2.7 cm of pb were used as the primary beam .",
    "al and pb were chosen as the represensitives of the light and the heavy elements . for al",
    "the @xmath7-scattering is , within experimental error , that predicted by the klien - nishima formula which assumes that the removal of the energy from the primary beam is entirely due to compton scattering of the extranuclear electrons .",
    "however , for pb additional scattering rays were observed .",
    "the wavelength and space distribution of these are inconsistent with an extranuclear scatterer @xcite .",
    "later on , this abnormal absorption was identified as the outcome of the process of electron - positron pair production .",
    "therefore this experiment was also the first experimental indiction of the first anti - matter particle , positron , in the observation history for the antimatter .    ",
