    "indeed , previous numerical simulations demonstrated that star formation is possible in the gaseous tails stripped from gas - rich disk galaxies ( bekki et al . 2005 ) .",
    "some of the eldots can be low- or high - redshifts background galaxies with the redshifted emission lines detected in the narrow filter passband adopted for observations ( e.g. , w10 ) .",
    "although w10 confirmed that massive star formation observed as eldots in the outer parts of disk galaxies tends to be associated with interacting galaxies , they also discovered eldots that were located in the far outskirts of galactic disks with no signs of galaxy interaction .",
    "such eldots can be simply local star - forming regions of the very outer disks in gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "it is also possible that star - forming low - mass dwarf galaxies are identified as eldots , because their stellar envelopes are too faint to be detected in the current optical observations .",

    "meyer et al . ( 2015 ) have investigated the presence or absence of uv emission for hi compact cloud samples from galfa - hi and alfalfa blind hi surveys and identified 29 candidates with uv emission .",
    "they suggested that such gas - rich hi clouds with uv emission can be very low - mass dwarfs leo p and leo t.    it is currently unclear whether there is an evolution link between eldots in isolated environments and extremely gas - rich , very faint dwarf ( `` almost dark '' ) galaxies such as those observed as isolated compact hvcs with or without stars .",
    "these apparently isolated clouds can be identified as eldots , if the star formation rates ( sfrs ) are high enough ( sfr@xmath11 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 ) to produce at least one o or b type stars ( e.g. , fig . 15 in thilker",
    "et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is therefore an interesting problem whether and how these extremely gas - rich dwarfs can show an observationally detectable star formation activity .",
    "because of the lack of detailed theoretical studies of star formation in these dwarfs , it remain unclear in what physical conditions a detectable amount of star formation can be triggered in such almost dark galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to propose a possible evolutionary link between eldots and extremely gas - rich low - mass dwarf galaxies based on the new results of numerical simulations of almost dark galaxies .",
    "we particularly focus on interacting and merging low - mass dwarf galaxies with their dark matter halo masses ( @xmath12 ) equal to or less than @xmath13 .",
    "this is because previous simulations mainly discussed the formation of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ; bekki 2008 ) and star formation histories ( stierwalt et al . 2015 ) in relatively high - mass ( @xmath14 ) interacting / merging dwarf galaxies . although recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that dwarf - dwarf merging can cause morphological transformation of low - mass dwarf galaxies ( e.g.,kazantzidis et al .",
    "2011 ; yozin & bekki 2012 ) , these were unable to discuss star formation histories of the galaxies .",

    "( 2007 ) showed that if a star - forming region of a star cluster ( or of a galaxy ) has its sfr less than a threshold sfr , it can not be detected as a h@xmath7 source .",
    "the threshold sfr is defined as ( thilker et al .",
    "2007 ) : @xmath64 we adopt this value in order to discuss whether a simulated galaxy can be detected as a h@xmath7 ( star - forming ) object .",
    "1 shows that star formation can be ignited as dwarf - dwarf interaction starts ( @xmath65 gyr ) in the fiducial merger model m1 with @xmath62 .",
    "the sfr during dwarf - dwarf interaction and merging can be significantly higher than @xmath66 yr@xmath1 ( = sfr@xmath67(h@xmath7 ) ) at @xmath68 gyr in this model , and only one of the interacting galaxies can host a compact h  ii region .",
    "the total stellar mass of new stars ( @xmath69 ) at @xmath68 gyr is only @xmath70 , and the stellar envelopes of old stars in the dwarfs have surface densities that are by a factor of @xmath71 lower than that of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the mergers of the present models show that @xmath72 ( where @xmath73band surface brightness is 25 mag arcsec@xmath74 ) is less than 100 pc .",
    "therefore this star - forming object in m1 is unlikely to be detected as a faint galaxy like blue diffuse dwarfs ( e.g. , james et al .",
    "2015 ) , if its distance is more than 20 mpc : it could be identified as a point - source ( @xmath75 ) at such a distance . this object with a h  ii region",
    "can be identified as an isolated emission line object ( eldot ) .",
    "the merger remnant at @xmath76 gyr also has two neighboring h  ii regions surrounded by young stars with @xmath77 .",
    "although this low - luminosity remnant is also likely to be detected as an isolated eldot , it can be detected as an isolated gas cloud , if radio observations can detect its cold gas mass of @xmath78 .",
    "after dwarf - dwarf merging , the remnant can slowly build up its central compact stellar system composed of new stars by converting the inflowing very metal - poor gas into stars ( @xmath79 gyr ) .",
    "the sfr can be kept as high as @xmath80 so that the final @xmath69 at @xmath81 gyr can be @xmath82 . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the typical metallicity of young stars is still low ( @xmath83 ) even after merging ( @xmath79 gyr ) . unlike major mergers between luminous galaxies ,",
    "the low - mass dwarf - dwarf merging does not show rapid chemical enrichment owing to the very low star formation efficiency ( @xmath84 yr@xmath1 ) and sfr . as a result of this , the merger remnant can have stellar and gaseous metallicities that are only slightly higher than the initial values .",
    "these remnants can be detected as extremely metal - poor ( i.e. , 12+log(o / h)@xmath85 ) , blue star - forming dwarfs when the central luminosities of young stars is high enough .",
    "2 shows that sfrs in the six isolated models are either zero or rather low ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ) , which implies that these gas - rich , metal - poor faint dwarfs in isolation are unlikely to be detected by recent emission - line surveys .",
    "the physical reason for this low sfr is that local and global dynamical instabilities , which can trigger galaxy - wide star formation , can be almost completely suppressed by the dominance of massive dark matter halos in these models ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "these dwarfs , however , might be detected by uv observations ( e.g. , meyer et al .",
    "2015 ) , if they have @xmath87 ( e.g. , thilker et al . 2007 ) and if they are relatively nearby objects .",
    "2 also shows sfrs can be higher than @xmath88 yr@xmath1 only during and after dwarf - dwarf merging in the six representative models .",
    "although hyperbolic tidal interaction can significantly enhance sf in the models m1-m4 with @xmath62 , it can not ignite sf in low - mass models m5 and m6 with @xmath40 .",
    "these results imply that major merging is essential for such low - mass dwarfs to have a detectable amount of sf .",
    "the isolated model m3 with higher @xmath89 can have sfrs that can be detected by emission whereas other models with lower @xmath37 show no or little sf in the isolated evolution .",
    "this result suggests that @xmath37 is a key parameter for sf histories of low - mass dwarfs in isolation .",
    "the remnants of low - mass dwarf - dwarf merging can continue their low - level sf , because new gas disks with higher gas densities can be developed after gas - rich merging .",
    "it is confirmed that minor dwarf - dwarf merging can show sfrs higher than @xmath90 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 , thought the mean sfr can be significantly lower than major merging cases .",
    "3 shows that the remnant of dwarf - dwarf merging with @xmath40 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 has a very compact nucleus with @xmath93 pc embedded by a very diffuse stellar envelope with @xmath94 mag arcsec@xmath74 at @xmath95 pc .",
    "the final total masses of old and new stars are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the compact nucleus with the size well less than 100pc can be classified as a low - mass globular cluster ( gc ) owing to the very low surface brightness envelope of old stars , if it is detected in photometric observations .",
    "since the merger precursor galaxy in this model corresponds to an ufd , this result suggests that gas - rich ufds can be transformed into low - mass `` gcs '' with stellar halos .",
    "these `` gcs '' ( which are indeed nucleated ufds with star formation ) can have dark matter halos and therefore can be distinguished from normal gcs without dark matter . since this transformation from ufds into low - mass gcs is a serendipitous discovery in the present study ,",
    "we need to explore the details of this transformation process in our future studies .",
    "the comparative model m7 with no old stars and a low @xmath37 ( @xmath98 ) does not show any sf in isolated , interacting , and merging cases ( thus not shown in fig .",
    "the compact gas cloud in the merger remnant embedded in a dark matter halo could be identified as a high velocity cloud ( hvc ) in a luminous galaxy like the galaxy , when it enters inter the virial radius of the galaxy .",
    "the comparative merger model m8 with @xmath99 shows low - level sf during and after major merging whereas the isolated model m8 does not show any sf .",
    "these results for m7 and m8 imply that there would be a threshold @xmath37 above which star formation is re - activated through merging in low - mass halos .",
    "we have shown that extremely gas - rich , very faint dwarf ( `` almost dark '' ) galaxies are unlikely to have sfrs higher than @xmath88 yr@xmath1 , if they are in isolation",
    ". however , such almost dark galaxies can become star - forming objects with sfrs as high as @xmath80 yr@xmath1 that is readily detected in recent h@xmath7 emission surveys ( e.g. , w10 ) , when they interact or merge with other low - mass galaxies : these objects with very low - level sf transformed from almost dark galaxies might be dubbed as `` cosmic fireflies '' .",
    "the star - forming regions with sfrs much lower than @xmath100 yr@xmath1 are compact surrounded by very low surface brightness envelopes of old stars that can be hardly detected by optical observations .",
    "therefore , such interacting / merging dwarfs with detectable sf are likely to be identified as isolated eldots rather than starbursting bcds .",
    "after dwarf - dwarf interaction and merging , star formation can continue to occur at low level ( sfr@xmath101 yr@xmath1 ) in the star - forming low - mass dwarfs .",
    "the total mass of new stars ( @xmath69 ) in the central compact component of the dwarfs can be large ( @xmath102 ) so that the central components can be detected as low - luminosity compact blue dwarfs . however , the mean stellar metallicities of the dwarfs are still rather low ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "therefore , such dwarfs are likely to be classified as xmd galaxies , if they are detected by optical and spectroscopic observations .",
    "the present study thus suggests that some of the observed xmd galaxies ( e.g. , ekta et al .",
    "2010 ; skillman et al .",
    "2013 ; james et al .",
    "2015 ) can be the remnants of dwarf - dwarf interaction and merging . given that a number of observational studies have recently started to search for very faint optical counterparts of compact hvcs ( e.g. , adams et al .",
    "2015 ; janowiecki et al .",
    "2015 ; sand et al .",
    "2015 ) , these results provide the following important implications on the origins of eldots , compact hvcs , and xmd dwarfs .",
    "first is that there could be two different types of eldots with low and high metallicities .",
    "the present study predicts ( i ) that eldots formed from interacting or merging low - luminosity dwarf galaxies show rather low metallicity ( @xmath103 ) and ( ii ) that they might be surrounded by very low surface brightness old stellar components . since eldots formed from gas stripped from luminous disk galaxies ( like ngc 1533 ) or in the very outer part of galactic gas disks are unlikely to show very low metallicities , the metallicities of eldots might be a key to discriminate between different formation scenarios of eldots .",
    "also , very deep optical imaging of eldots is doubtlessly worthwhile , because it would be able to reveal the very low surface - brightness components of low - mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "second is that interacting and merging low - mass dwarfs can be identified as compact hvcs with star formation .",
    "recently , stark et al . (",
    "2015 ) have revealed that there is an excess of ob stars along the line of sight to the smith cloud , which is one of the massive hvcs in the galaxy .",
    "they suggested that the hvc has been forming stars since it passed through the galaxy about 70 myr ago .",
    "the present study suggests that the cloud is a very gas - rich low - mass dwarf galaxy with its star formation highly enhanced by the interaction with the galaxy .",
    "it is , however , unclear why such a low - mass dwarfs can retain much gas now , since ram pressure stripping by the galactic halo gas can remove all gas from such low - mass dwarf galaxies ( yozin & bekki 2015 ) .",
    "third is that some of the observed compact hvcs in the galaxy and m31 ( e.g. , westmeier et al .",
    "2005 ) might be the remnants of ancient mergers between low - mass halos : some compact hvcs are embedded in low - mass dark matter halos .",
    "the compact hvcs embedded in dark matter halo might be less susceptible to the ram pressure stripping by their host galaxies so that the central regions can survive from such stripping processes and thus can be identified as compact hvcs . as demonstrated in the present study , star formation is unlikely in dwarf - dwarf mergers with very low @xmath2 and @xmath37 , though this might be due largely to the adopted simulation code with no efficient cooling below @xmath104k .",
    "no / little star formation can prevent cold gas from thermal evaporation of energetic supernovae so that the merger remnants can be still observed as compact gas clouds .",
    "fourth is that the observed recent star formation in nearby very faint dwarf galaxies like leo t ( e.g. , ryan - weber et al . 2008 ) and leo p ( e.g. , skillman et al .",
    "2013 ) can be due to their recent interaction and merging with other low - mass faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "fifth is that there can be numerous very faint dwarf galaxies ( like ufds ) with very low - level star formation ( sfrs well less than @xmath90 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 ) undetected in the present h@xmath7 observations .",
    "gas - rich very faint dwarf galaxies located outside the local group might not be detected by current hi surveys either , if their gas masses are less than @xmath105 .",
    "these almost dark dwarf galaxies will be able to be detected by future wide - field , ultra - deep hi observations by the square kilometre array ( ska ) , if they really exit .",
    "the present study suggests that there is an evolutionary link between almost dark galaxies , isolated eldots , and xmd dwarfs .",
    "it should be noted here , however , that the present study assumed low - mass dark matter halos hosting very gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "although a number of ongoing observational projects aim at detecting very gas - rich , low - mass dwarf candidates ( e.g. , meyer et al .",
    "2015 ) , it is currently unclear whether there really exist numerous almost dark dwarfs in the universe : the observed almost dark galaxies could be just a rare class of dwarfs .",
    "if such galaxies are a major population in low - mass halos , then the present results imply that there could be much more isolated eldots and xmd dwarfs at higher redsfhits , when interaction and merging between low - mass halos is highly likely to be much more frequent .",
