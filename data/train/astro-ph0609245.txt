    "a symbiotic star is a binary composed of a red giant and a hot blue component , often an accreting white dwarf .",
    "many symbiotic stars have been detected as soft x - ray sources using _ rosat _ @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "detections can usually be classified into two types .",
    "one is of the supersoft type , which can be understood as photospheric emission from the hot white dwarf .",
    "the second type is optically thin plasma emission with temperatures of order 10@xmath1k , which attributed to the colliding winds .",
    "that is , a strong , fast ( @xmath21000 kms@xmath3 ) wind from the vicinity of the accreting white dwarf , which , in many cases , are known to be present through studies of uv and optical emission lines , is colliding with the dense , low - velocity wind from the m giant , shock - heating the gas to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "more recently , a subset of symbiotic stars have been shown to be a strong source of hard ( @xmath410 kev ) x - rays in the _ integral _ galactic plane scan and in the _ swift _ bat survey ( @xcite and references therein ) , which requires the presence of yet another type of x - ray emission in these symbiotic stars .",
    "ch cygni is an oft - observed , yet poorly - understood symbiotic star , at a distance of 245@xmath550 pc according to the _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements @xcite .",
    "it has produced radio @xcite and optical @xcite jets , which appear to be ejected in the plane of the sky as seen from the earth , implying an accretion disk and/or binary with an inclination angle of nearly 90@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite analyzed a large body of infrared spectra and proposed ch cyg to be a triple system , consisting of a 756 day period inner binary in an 14.5 yr orbit around a third component .",
    "however , @xcite cautioned against the triple system interpretation on several grounds .",
    "in particular , the orbital solution of requires a low inclination angle , contrary to the indications from the jet data .",
    "in addition , such a low inclination then results in the unrealistically low mass ( 0.2m@xmath7 ) for the white dwarf . to add to the confusion",
    ", @xcite claimed that ch cyg was a triple system as proposed by @xcite but both the inner and the outer binaries were eclipsing , thus requiring high inclination angles for both .",
    "more recently , the similarity between the 756 day period of ch cyg with non - radial pulsations in quite a few semi - regular variables has become apparent ; therefore , the 756 day period of ch cyg is likely to be a non - radial pulsation mode rather than an orbital period ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ch cyg has been known to be a variable x - ray source for many years ; the early x - ray data from _",
    "heao-1 _ to _ exosat _ are summarized by @xcite .",
    "it was detected with _",
    "rosat _ showing the colliding wind - type spectrum and an additional hard component @xcite .",
    "however , it was the _ asca _ observation that revealed the dramatic two - component x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "there is a relatively unabsorbed soft component , dominant below 2 kev , that can be modeled as two - temperature ( kt@xmath20.2 , 0.7 kev ) optically thin thermal plasma emission . above 2 kev",
    ", there is a separate , highly absorbed hotter component ( kt@xmath27 kev ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted the latter as due to accretion onto a @xmath40.44 m@xmath7 white dwarf , and the former as either from the m giant or from the jets .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative interpretation of a single spectral component seen through an ionized wind of the m giant .",
    "hetg observation was performed to decide between the two models , but ch cyg was found to be much fainter than during the _ asca _ observation , making the grating data of little use .",
    "instead , @xcite analyzed the 0th order data and discovered a weak , spatially extended emission from the jet , in addition to the much brighter , spatially unresolved , component .",
    "here we report on two _ suzaku _ observations of ch cyg performed in 2006 .",
    "we have also re - analyzed the _",
    "data and the _ chandra _ zeroth order data , and present the results in a uniform manner .",
    "we observed ch cyg twice with the japanese - us x - ray astronomy satellite , _ suzaku _ @xcite .",
    "the exposure times with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) instrument @xcite was approximately 35 ksec on both occasions .",
    "we have analyzed the data prepared using the version 0.7 pipeline @xcite .",
    "this results in an energy scale accurate to @xmath50.2% at fe k@xmath0 and @xmath55 ev below 1 kev @xcite .",
    "although ch cyg is definitely detected with the pin detector of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) instrument at approximately 7@xmath8 ergs@xmath9s@xmath3 in the 1225 kev band , this is sufficiently close to the current systematic uncertainties in the background estimation @xcite that we have chosen to concentrates on the xis data .",
    "we have extracted the xis data from a 2.5 arcmin radius extraction region centered on the source , used the 2.55.0 arcmin annulus as the background , and generated response files taking into account the vignetting of the x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the time - variable contamination on the optical blocking filter of the xis .",
    "we have combined the spectra taken with the three units ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) with frontside illuminated ( fi ) ccds , and analyze the combined spectrum simultaneously with that taken with xis1 with the backside illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "our source extraction region contains roughly 93% of the source flux , and this is taken into account by the response file . on the other hand , it does not account for the fact that the remaining 7% of the flux is in the background region , and this has been subtracted away ; we have therefore multiplied the fluxes derived from the spectral fits by 1.08 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the log of _ suzaku _ observations can be found in table[tab : obslog ] , together with a summary of the _ asca _ ( see @xcite for details ) and _ chandra _ ( see @xcite for details ) data .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     ch cyg has shown a dramatic spectral variability over the last dozen years or so , while keeping the same basic two - component structures . at the same time , _ swift _ bat 1425 kev light curve of ch cyg also shows a decline , from @xmath11 ctss@xmath3 in the 1425 kev band during the first 3 months of 2005 to an undetectable level ( @xmath12 ctss@xmath3 ) by the end of 2005 @xcite .",
    "we first consider the nature of the hard x - ray decline from the _ asca _ era to the _ suzaku _ era .",
    "the extraordinary strength of the 6.4 kev , fluorescent fe k@xmath0 line shows that our direct line - of - sight is now blocked and we only observe hard x - ray photons scattered into our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the low - energy cut - offs of the hard component did not vary much among the four observations shown in figure[fig : unf ] .",
    "the best - fit n@xmath13 values were 1.4 , 4.1 , 3.2 , and 2.2 @xmath14 @xmath9 , respectively in our fits to the four observations .",
    "such levels of absorption , which are admittedly uncertain due to the relatively simple model we have adopted , are insufficient to explain the observed equivalent widths of the 6.4 kev line in case ii of ( spherically symmetric absorber , direct and scattered x - rays both observed at earth ) , and requires case iii ( direct x - rays hidden ) .    in contrast , the fe k@xmath0 complex was dominated by the thermal lines in the _ asca _ data , so in that observation our direct line of sight was open . the continuum flux declined by a factor of @xmath230 .",
    "in contrast , the 6.4 kev line fluxes declined from 3.5@xmath15 photons@xmath9s@xmath3 to 1.4 and 1.0@xmath15 photons@xmath9s@xmath3 , respectively , in the two _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "it is therefore likely that all of the direct x - rays , as well as the majority ( 6070% ) of the scattered x - rays , are blocked during the _ suzaku _ era .    as for the central engine that produces the hard x - ray emission ,",
    "we consider it likely that this is due to accretion onto the white dwarf , following @xcite .",
    "in fact , the temperature ( kt@xmath210 kev ) and the luminosity ( 10@xmath16 ergss@xmath3 ) seen by _ asca _ are both similar to that seen in the old nova , v603  aql @xcite .",
    "if this analogy is correct , then the x - rays are probably generated in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and a relatively massive white dwarf .    between the m giant wind and the corona , wind , and/or jet from the accretion disk ,",
    "there are more than enough candidates for the scattering medium .",
    "however , as @xcite have calculated , typical line - of - sight column through the m giant wind in a symbiotic system is @xmath17 @xmath9 , which is borne out observationally by the widespread detection of the supersoft x - rays in symbiotic stars @xcite .",
    "m giant winds are therefore far too optically thin to produce a significant amount scattered x - rays .",
    "unless the white dwarf in ch cyg is unusually close to the photosphere of the m giant , which now seems unlikely with the preference for a 14.5 yr orbital period @xcite , or the m giant has much stronger mass loss than in other symbiotic systems , the m giant wind is therefore unlikely to be the site of hard x - ray absorption and scattering .",
    "moreover , the strong decrease in the 6.4 kev flux also points to a relatively compact site for the scattering , i.e. , material associated with the accretion disk , such as an accretion disk corona or an accretion disk wind .    what about the compton - thick material that is required to block out the direct hard x - rays ?",
    "the m giant itself is a candidate .",
    "however , according to @xcite , the eclipse of the 14.5 yr binary would have happened around 2000 .",
    "thus , the existing orbital solution of ch cyg suggests that the 2006 low state is not due to an eclipse by the m giant .",
    "we therefore consider it likely that the blockage was caused by the accretion disk .",
    "recall that jet observations indicate a high inclination angle for the disk @xcite , very close to 90@xmath6 .",
    "perhaps the disk thickness varies from epoch to epoch ; perhaps the disk is slightly tilted and precesses . in either case",
    ", it seems reasonable for a highly inclined disk to be able to block our direct line - of - sight .",
    "if the scattering medium is , say , a relatively compact accretion disk corona , it is plausible for a tilted and/or thickened outer disk also to block a significant fraction of the scattered x - rays , as we have inferred from the decline in fluorescent fe line flux .",
    "if this picture is correct , the same thickening or precession of the accretion disk may also explain some of the optical / uv variability of ch cyg .",
    "new optical / uv observations in the _ swift _ era will enable a direct comparison of hard x - ray and optical / uv variabilites .    what can we learn about the soft component from the _ suzaku _ data ?",
    "we believe we now have sufficient data to disprove the ionized absorber interpretation of @xcite .",
    "first , the analysis of @xcite showed that while the hard component was significantly variable , the soft component was consistent with poisson noise .",
    "this is difficult to explain in the ionized absorber model .",
    "second , we do not believe that the compton - thick material blocking our line of sight to the hard x - ray emission region can be significantly ionized , given the modest x - ray luminosity ( of order 10@xmath16 ergss@xmath3 ) of ch cyg .",
    "finally , the he - like line of mg is clearly seen in figure[fig : xis ] , while the h - like line is not . since the latter is stronger in any plasma hotter than kt@xmath20.8 kev , we conclude that the soft component is dominated by plasma cooler than kt@xmath20.8 kev .",
    "this is also consistent with the strengths of other emission lines ( o , fe l , ne ) seen below 1 kev , which would be significantly diluted if much hotter plasma co - existed in the emission region .",
    "we therefore conclude that the soft x - rays indeed are a distinct component .",
    "the emitting region must be separate from , or significantly more extended than , the hard x - ray emitting region .",
    "on the other hand , the bulk of the soft x - rays were spatially unresolved with _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "this sets the maximum size to be of order 100 au ( 0.4@xmath18 at 250 pc ) , or 800 light minute in radius .",
    "the entire binary is likely to be smaller than this , assuming a 14.5 yr orbital period .",
    "an extended emission region , comparable to the size of the binary , is expected in the colliding wind interpretation , in which the m giant wind is colliding with an outflow from the vicinity of the accreting white dwarf .",
    "the exact nature of the latter is unclear ; it can be a compact jet ( unlike that produced the spatially - resolved x - rays observed with _",
    "chandra _ ; @xcite ) , or it can be a less collimated outflow , more appropriately termed wind .",
    "colliding wind systems are usually not highly variable on short time scales , presumably because any local instabilities are averaged over the large emission site . only a global change ( changes in binary separation or in the wind mass loss rate )",
    "can modulate the x - ray flux significantly .",
    "if the colliding wind emission is from a 10 au size region , and the accretion disk wind velocity is 1,000 kms@xmath3 , then we do not expect significant modulation in soft x - rays on time scales shorter than about 2 weeks from a `` wind travel time '' argument .",
    "this consistent with the lack of soft x - ray variability seen with _",
    "asca _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the soft component to be from the corona of the m giant .",
    "however , m giants are in the `` coronal graveyard '' to the upper right of the dividing line in the hr diagram .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of single giants in this region show that coronal emissions are far too low a level to explain the soft component of ch cyg : arcturus is detected at 3@xmath19 level at a 0.22 kev luminosity of @xmath20 ergss@xmath3 and the upper limit for aldebaran is 7@xmath21 @xcite ; the m supergiant betelgeuse has a _",
    "upper limit of @xmath22 ergss@xmath3 for coronal temperature @xmath23 k @xcite . whenever m giants are detected in x - rays , they are usually interpreted as due to a binary companion ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although binarity can affect the x - ray luminosity , this is limited to short period systems ( periods of 2 days  2 weeks for rs cvn systems , for example ) where tidal torque would lead to synchronous rotation , which is unlikely in a symbiotic binary .",
    "for the coronal model of the soft x - ray emission to succeed , the mass donor in the ch cyg system must be a truly exceptional m giant .",
    "so far , we have concentrated on the comparison between _ asca _ and _ suzaku _ data .",
    "what about the _ chandra _ observation , during which both the soft and the hard x - ray components were fainter and there was no detection of the fluorescent fe k@xmath0 line ? for this , we must invoke a separate mechanism .",
    "if the accretion rate onto the white dwarf declines dramatically , we expect both the hard and the soft x - ray luminosities to drop , and this appears to be what happened in 2001 .",
    "our two _ suzaku _ observations of ch cyg have caught the system in a soft x - ray bright , hard x - ray dim state . based on the fe k@xmath0 spectra , we believe we currently observe only the scattered hard x - ray component . the decline in the hard x - ray flux is only an apparent decline , and the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of ch cyg may still be as high as during the _ asca _ observation , though the actual value is unknowable .",
    "a symbiotic star such as ch cyg is filled with possible scattering media , but we favor material above the accretion disk as the scattering site . as for the object that blocks our direct view of the hard x - ray emission , we believe it is more likely to be an edge - on accretion disk than the m giant mass donor .",
    "the hard x - rays presumably originate from accretion onto the white dwarf , but further progress would require high - quality x - ray spectroscopy when the direct view is not blocked .",
