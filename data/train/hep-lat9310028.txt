    "is forced to assume an effective model describing the collective degrees of freedom of rough interfaces .    the _ capillary wave model _ ( cwm )",
    "@xcite in its simplest formulation , which we will follow , assumes an effective hamiltonian proportional to the area of the surface .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that rather strong finite - size effects , depending on the shape of the lattice , are well described in terms of the _ one  loop _ or gaussian approximation to the cwm : its predictions have been tested with high accuracy in the scaling region of the 3d ising model .",
    "these one  loop corrections depend only on one adimensional parameter , namely on the asymmetry @xmath0 of the transverse sizes of an elongated lattice @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with periodic boundary conditions taken in all directions @xcite .",
    "as it has been already pointed out @xcite , higher order corrections to the gaussian model can be taken into account to verify the cwm beyond the one  loop approximation .",
    "these higher order corrections can provide a more stringent test of the cwm model : in fact , while many different effective hamiltonians reduce to the gaussian form at one  loop level @xcite , they differ in the form of two and higher  loop corrections . in this paper",
    "we apply the cwm in the two  loop approximation to the finite  size behavior of order  order rough interfaces in the 3d three - state potts model .",
    "the two  loop contributions do not depend only on the asymmetry parameter @xmath3 but also on an adimensional parameter proportional to the minimal area of the surface , namely @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the ( reduced ) interface tension .",
    "an important consequence of this fact is that the well known finite - size behavior @xcite of the energy splitting @xmath6 occurring between vacua on finite volumes , has no longer , at two  loop , the _ classical _ functional form @xmath7 not even for symmetric ( @xmath8 ) lattices .",
    "this must be contrasted with what happens at one  loop level , where , due to the scale  invariance of the one  loop contributions , one has to consider asymmetric lattices to find deviations from the classical functional form @xcite .    to verify the cwm we study the finite - size behavior of rough order - order interfaces of the 3d three - state potts model by means of monte carlo numerical simulations .",
    "this model is of great interest because of its well known connection with 4d @xmath9 pure yang ",
    "mills theory at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in fact one can assume an effective action of a 3d spin model with short  range , ferromagnetic interaction to describe the finite temperature deconfinement transition of qcd in the limit of infinite quark masses @xcite .",
    "for this reason the potts model has been extensively investigated and , in particular , the properties of order - order and order - disorder interfaces have been already studied @xcite , one of the main goals being the evaluation of the corresponding interface tensions .    in this paper",
    "we show that the knowledge of the functional form of the fluid interface free energy on finite volumes , including the capillary wave contributions , enables one to estimate the order - order interface tension with high precision .",
    "moreover , the good agreement we find with the theoretical predictions of the cwm model at two  loop order strongly supports the idea of the universality of this description of rough interfaces in 3d statistical models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "we describe the cwm and its one  loop and two  loop approximations . in sec .",
    "we compare the results of mc simulations with the cwm predictions .",

    "according to the cwm , the interface between two domains of different magnetization in the ordered phase of a 3d spin system , above the roughening temperature , is described by the partition function    @xmath10\\exp\\left\\{-\\sigma a\\left [ x\\right ] \\right\\}~~ , \\label{zeta}\\ ] ]    where the single - valued function @xmath11 describes the displacement from the equilibrium position of the interface , @xmath5 is the reduced ( order - order ) interface tension and @xmath12 $ ] is the area of the interface    @xmath13=\\int_0^{r } dr \\int_0^{t}dt~ \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}\\right)^2}~~. \\label{acw}\\ ] ]    it should be mentioned that ( [ acw ] ) coincides with the nambu - goto string action in @xmath14 in a particular gauge .",
    "( [ acw ] ) is not expected to be the _ exact _ action describing fluid interfaces but at least the dominant contribution : as we will show this is indeed the case .    to compare the predictions of the cwm with numerical results from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , we have chosen 3d lattices of @xmath15 sites , with @xmath2 , and periodic boundary conditions in each direction .",
    "this particular choice of the lattice shape allows one to consider only interfaces orthogonal to the elongated ( @xmath16 ) direction , the probability of having interfaces orthogonal to the other directions being negligible .",
    "the 2d field @xmath11 is therefore defined on the rectangle @xmath17\\times \\left[0,t\\right]$ ] with opposite edges identified , i.e. on a torus .",
    "the partition function ( [ zeta ] ) can not be computed exactly , but it is possible to express it as an expansion in powers of the adimensional parameter @xmath18 : the two  loop expansion of @xmath19 can then be written as @xmath20 the one  loop contribution ( namely the gaussian approximation ) , obtained retaining only the quadratic term in the expansion of ( [ acw ] ) , is nothing else than the exact partition function of a 2d conformal invariant free boson on a torus of modular parameter @xmath21 @xcite    @xmath22      the two functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 appearing above are respectively the dedekind function and the second eisenstein series :    @xmath26    the three  state potts model is defined by the partition function @xmath27\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the variables @xmath28 are defined on a three  dimensional hypercubic lattice and take the values @xmath29 in the termodynamic limit the potts model is known to undergo a ( weak ) first  order phase transition at @xmath30 @xcite and the roughening temperature can be estimate to be @xmath31 @xcite . for @xmath32",
    "the @xmath33 symmetry is spontaneously broken and the three ordered phases coexist , while at @xmath34 also the disordered phase coexists with the previous ones .",
    "in the finite _ cylindric _ geometry we are considering spontaneous symmetry breaking at low temperature can not occur : the degeneracy of the ground state is removed , the energy of the symmetric , @xmath33 invariant , ground state being separated by an energy splitting @xmath6 from the two degenerate mixed - symmetry states .",
    "the energy splitting is due to tunneling between the phases and is directly linked to the free energy of the interface @xcite .",
    "according to the cwm , for @xmath35 , we assume @xcite , @xmath36 ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is an unpredicted constant and a convenient normalization has been chosen .",
    "we would like to stress that the two  loop contribution ( [ 2loop ] ) does not depend only on the ratio @xmath0 , like the one  loop term ( [ 1loop ] ) , but also on the minimal area @xmath39 .",

    "the _ classical _ formula @xcite    @xmath44    can be recovered only neglecting the two  loop contribution .",
    "the comparison between formula ( [ e1 ] ) and the values of @xmath6 extracted from mc simulations provides a simple and stringent way to verify the cwm predictions .",
    "it should be noted that no new free parameters are introduced within this approach : the formulae ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) contain the same number of undetermined parameters , namely @xmath5 and @xmath38 .",
    "to extract the energy splitting @xmath6 from mc  generated ensembles we follow the procedure of @xcite . defining the time  slice magnetization @xmath45 we compute the correlation function @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and we extract the transfer matrix low energy levels from the asymptotic @xmath48dependence of @xmath49 @xmath50\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + c_1\\left\\{\\exp(-ke')+\\exp[-(l - k)e']\\right\\}~+~\\dots~~\\label{fit}\\\\ z & = & 1 + 2 e^{-l e } + \\dots\\label{gk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 tr @xmath52 being the partition function ( the next  to  leading energy level @xmath53 turns out to be non  negligible in our range of parameters ) .",
    "having so extracted the energy splitting @xmath6 from the mc data for different values of the lattice sizes , we can compute the order - order interface tension @xmath5 and the constant @xmath38 by fitting our data with the formula ( [ e1 ] ) .",

    "this value of @xmath58 is enough inside the ordered phase to make highly suppressed the probability of formation of order - disorder interfaces @xcite but presents a correlation length large enough to make the lattice artifacts negligible and to consider domain walls as fluid interfaces .",
    "the fact that the disordered phase is substantially absent at this @xmath58 can be seen from the histograms of the real part of the magnetization @xcite @xmath59 as is shown , for example , in fig.1 .",
    "the modulus of the magnetization at this @xmath58 is about @xmath60 for the lattice sizes we are considering : in this figure the projection on the real axis of the ordered phases are clearly visible while the peak centered at @xmath61 , which would signal the presence of the disordered phase , is absent .    fig .",

    "most configurations consist of a single phase or of two phases separated by two interfaces ( the minimum number compatible with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the single  phase configurations are represented by the three clusters of points corresponding to the three degenerate vacua ; the two  interface configurations form the straight lines joining these clusters .",
    "interface configurations , which tend to fill uniformly the interior of the triangle , are clearly visible in fig .",
    "3 : it corresponds to a @xmath63 , @xmath64 lattice and to a larger probability of having tunneling events ( i.e. interfaces ) , while these are much more suppressed for the lattice of fig .",

    "we have made between @xmath66 and @xmath67 sweeps for each experiment , depending on the lattice size , obtaining about @xmath68 data per observable .",
    "however , the covariance matrix turns out to be different from the diagonal form , which one expects from a sample of statistical independent data .",
