    "in recent years , there has been tremendous progress to realize systems that are capable of achieving strong interactions between individual photons @xcite .",
    "one common approach has been to couple single atoms ( or other quantum emitters ) to high - finesse optical cavities , to take advantage of the intrinsic nonlinear nature of these two - level systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , gases of cold rydberg atoms have been investigated @xcite . in this case , the optical nonlinearities are effectively generated via strong atom - atom interactions , with a novel consequence being that the nonlinearity becomes spatially non - local in character @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally shown that this type of nonlinearity can give rise to exotic states such as a two - photon bound state @xcite , and a number of other few- and many - body states of light have been theoretically predicted @xcite .",
    "key to this approach is that atoms excited to a rydberg state , in particular through the absorption of a photon , exert a strong dispersive effect on proximal atoms , shifting their transition frequencies to rydberg states by an amount proportional to @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the interatomic separation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : level_int]a ) @xcite .",

    "this in turn yields a large level shift ( @xmath4ghz for atoms separated by @xmath5 m in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ) ; however , all of the interesting variation in the atomic refractive index occurs over much smaller bandwidths of a few mhz ( characteristic of the atomic linewidth ) . in this article",
    ", we demonstrate the new opportunities arising for nonlinear optics if the strength and range of the interaction can be independently adjusted . in particular ,",

    "it has been proposed that one can control the type and range of atomic interactions @xcite , and hence the interactions between photons @xcite , by engineering the underlying optical dispersion of these structures .",
    "we specifically study the dynamics of photons propagating through an atomic ensemble coupled to the waveguide under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , which occurs for three level atoms such as shown in fig .",

    "the optical depth is 400 for plots ( a)-(c ) and 800 for plot ( d ) , with @xmath132 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath59 and @xmath168 . ]",
    "we can also observe the phononic oscillations of the pair of photons in the photon output .",
    "inputting photons into the system in a gaussian pulse as above , the photons are initially separated on average by less than the ground state separation , which initializes an oscillation in the two - photon wavefunction .",
    "the relative position of the two photons at the output depends on the ratio of the length over which the pulse travels in one oscillation period , @xmath169 , to the length of the atomic medium @xmath170 .",
    "an oscillation can then be observed at output by either adjusting the effective length of the system , for example by reducing the number of atoms by waiting for the atomic trap to decay , or by adjusting the strength @xmath171 of the interaction potential , for example by adjusting the drive rabi frequency @xmath35 . in the latter case ,",
    "the oscillation length is proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "however , adjusting the strength @xmath171 alone also changes the shape of the molecule , as the spatial extent of the ground state is approximately proportional to @xmath173 . reducing both @xmath116 and @xmath171 by the same factor @xmath174 then results in the molecule keeping its shape while increasing @xmath175 by a factor of @xmath176 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : full_pot](d ) we show a simulation of this situation , where we adjust @xmath171 and @xmath116 from the values used in fig .  [ fig : full_pot](a)-(c ) that initially lead to approximately one and a half oscillations over the length of the system . by reducing the values by a factor of three",
    "the exact simulation shows a full oscillation in the two photon output , i.e. , @xmath175 changes from @xmath177 to @xmath178 , confirming the prediction of our simple model .",
    "having described the main features of the two - photon molecule in the previous section , we now analyze more carefully the technical requirements in order to observe this physics .",
    "there are two main considerations , the first being the regime of validity of the effective equation ( [ eq : polariton_h ] ) that describes polaritons as massive particles propagating in a potential , and the second , the extent to which dissipation affects the molecular state . describing the polariton dynamics by eq .",
    "( [ eq : polariton_h ] ) is equivalent to keeping only terms of up to quadratic order in an expansion of the photon dispersion relation about the eit resonance .",
    "neglecting higher order terms is a good approximation within the eit window , which for @xmath179 , requires that the spread of frequencies of the relevant system dynamics remains within @xmath180 of the eit resonance . for a pulse that has length @xmath181 within the atomic medium ( e.g. , a gaussian intensity distribution @xmath182 ) to be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : polariton_h ] ) it must have frequency width @xmath183 , which can be recast as a requirement @xmath184 for the amount of optical depth @xmath185 in the pulse length .",
    "this identifies a tradeoff , where we would like to increase the ratio @xmath186 to reduce the effect of dissipation in the effective mass term , however to do so requires an increase in the optical depth required in an experiment .",
    "dissipation in our system comes from two main sources , one being spontaneous emission from the excited state @xmath14 that gives rise to the imaginary part of the effective mass term , and the other being the additional loss associated with introducing the photonic crystal mediated interactions .",
    "the former leads to loss as a pulse propagates over length @xmath49 in the atomic medium , which in the limit of validity of the quadratic dispersion is approximately @xmath187 $ ] .",
    "this is the loss for linear propagation of a pulse and for two photons propagating in a molecule the loss is squared . to observe an oscillation of a photonic molecule we would then like to take a minimal value of the oscillation length @xmath169 to reduce loss . to see how @xmath169 is constrained",
    ", we consider the case where the interaction potential can be approximately described as a harmonic oscillator , with gaussian ground state wavefunction @xmath188 $ ] in relative coordinate space , in which case the photon molecule would oscillate with frequency @xmath189 .",
    "the oscillation length @xmath190 is reduced by increasing @xmath191 , however this frequency is constrained to remain within the eit window , which then results in the restriction @xmath192 . taking the minimum value for @xmath169 and equating this with the system length @xmath170 , such that the photon molecule undergoes one full oscillation , then yields a propagation loss of @xmath193 $ ] .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : phc_int ] the loss related with the photonic crystal mediated interactions depends on the cooperativity of the atom - induced cavities in the photonic crystal . for a potential like that in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential](a ) , the loss rate is approximately @xmath194 ( taking @xmath195 ) where the proportionality constant @xmath196 depends on the details of how the two potentials are combined ( see appendix [ ap : potential ] ) . over one oscillation period of the photonic molecule",
    "we then expect the norm of the two photon wavefunction to be reduced by a factor of approximately @xmath197 $ ] as a result of this loss .",
    "compared with the propagation loss , this loss increases with increasing pulse length @xmath181 , as larger constituent pulses require larger effective cavities to create the potential in the photonic crystal .",
    "the total loss then represents a balance between the two contributions and an optimal pulse length can be found @xmath198 , at which point the total loss is @xmath199 . for parameters compatible with current experimental setups , @xmath110 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 , we have @xmath202 and the @xmath203 . the total optical depth to observe a single oscillation with these parameters is then @xmath204 . in experimental systems to date only a few atoms have been trapped near the photonic crystals , however optical depths per atom of @xmath205 have already been demonstrated @xcite , indicating that sufficient optical depth would be available with @xmath206 atoms .    while we have focused on the loss of the photonic molecule above , signatures of the molecule and its oscillations can be observed in photon correlation measurements with greatly reduced requirements on the system parameters . in particular , for a weak coherent state input , the normalized second - order correlation function @xmath207 will contain the salient features of the molecular dynamics even with significant two - photon losses , provided that the single - photon component decays in an even stronger manner .",
    "this strong single - photon loss can occur by exploiting the design of the correlated transparency window , and in particular enforcing that the transparency frequency for the two - photon molecule coincides with a region of the single - photon spectrum exhibiting strong absorption .",
    "this results in large loss of the single photon component , leading to the large values of @xmath161 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : full_pot](c ) , where our simulations include the loss mechanisms described above .",
    "the behavior of @xmath161 also depends on the nature of input and output .",
    "in particular , since the two - photon molecule is comprised of spatially separate photon pulses , this implies that there is a time @xmath208 upon entering and exiting that only one of the photons is inside the medium . during this time , the two - photon component experiences loss as a single photon would .",
    "this additional loss to the two - photon wavepacket could be avoided if the pulses were first loaded into the medium and then the interactions switched when both photons had already entered the medium and a similar procedure applied at output .",
    "in summary we have demonstrated that the versatile platform of cold atoms coupled to photonic crystal waveguides leads to new possibilities in quantum optics . in particular",
    ", the ability to tune interactions between atoms over distances much greater than the wavelength of light allows the propagation of light through the atomic medium to be highly non - linear and non - local .",
    "in contrast with current experiments demonstrating non - linearities due to rydberg interactions between atoms @xcite , the interactions discussed here can be arranged to give level shifts of the order of the atomic linewidth over the entire atomic ensemble .",
    "this allows for correlated transparency of photons through the medium , where depending on the number of photons propagating in the system , the system is only transparent to particular frequencies and spatial configurations , for example a photon molecule .",
    "while the focus of our numerical studies here have mainly been in comparing single and two photon dynamics in the system , the intuition formed provides important insight into the solution of the multi - photon problem , which is expected to display rich many - body behavior @xcite .",
    "the authors thank e. shahmoon , a. gorshkov and the kimble group for stimulating discussions . this work was supported by fundacio privada cellex barcelona , the mineco ramon y cajal program , the marie curie career integration grant atomnano , and erc starting grant foqal .",
    "in the main text we use the form @xmath77 to denote the resonant optical depth for @xmath76 two - level atoms .",
    "this expression can be derived using the transfer matrix formalism , where linear propagation in one - dimension is well described by treating each atom as a refractive element with transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath209 and @xmath210 on resonance @xcite . for @xmath211",
    "one expects that reflection is not important , and the transmitted intensity is given by the product of the individual atomic transmittance as @xmath212 .",
    "however when @xmath213 a single atom can act as a strong reflector of light and the spacing of the atoms becomes crucial in how much light is transmitted through the sample @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we choose the spacing between the atoms @xmath104",
    "so that @xmath214 , in which case there is destructive interference between the reflections from each atom in the ensemble . the transmission is then reproduced by the expression @xmath75 for @xmath215 . under this condition",
    "the optical properties are the same for two samples with the same @xmath77 , and using this property we can may then reduce the number of atoms required to simulate a system with particular optical depth by increasing @xmath78 proportionally",
    ".    the linear properties in the eit system can be even more robust , remaining the same for constant optical depth even when @xmath213 .",
    "a single three - level atom has transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath209 and @xmath216 $ ] for @xmath217 .",
    "we then find that after propagating through @xmath76 atoms with spacing @xmath214 the probe field acquires a phase given by @xmath218 $ ] , provided the two - photon detuning @xmath57 satisfies the condition @xmath219 . as in the two level case above this phase factor does not depend on @xmath78 and @xmath76 individually but on their product .",
    "thus for probes with @xmath219 we can again reduce the number of atoms and increase @xmath78 in a simulation to reduce computational requirements . from a practical point of view",
    "we can check this equivalence in our simulations by changing @xmath78 and @xmath76 appropriately and observing that the simulated behavior does not change .",
    "when photons enter the eit medium they are converted into polaritons , where the photonic excitation becomes a mixture of a photonic part and spin wave part with atomic population in the level @xmath7 .",
    "a single photon entering the system sees the eit resonance when @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : level_int]b ) . for more than one photon ,",
    "the presence of the interaction between the @xmath7 levels shifts the eit resonance .",
    "a shift in the eit resonance will lead to changes in velocity and dispersion of each pulse , and with a spatially dependent potential as shown in fig .  [",

    "the @xmath238 part of the second spatial derivative term can also be simplified in certain limits leading to an effective mass .",
    "particularly , in the case of uniform interactions there is no spatial dependence and it may be taken outside of the derivative . in the photon molecule case discussed in the main text ,",
    "the spatial dependence is approximately @xmath239 , which leads to terms that scale with @xmath240 that can be neglected for large optical depth pulses . in this case",
    "we may replace @xmath238 by @xmath241 .",
    "the exact form of the effective mass then depends on the particular correlated eit transparency we operate around , and is typically number dependent @xcite . for example , when we have uniform interactions @xmath242 and when we are expanding around the transparency for @xmath88 photons , that is when @xmath118 , we have that the effective mass term @xmath243 depends on the renormalized detuning @xmath244 ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_models](b ) ) . similarly in the photon molecule case we have @xmath245 and driving at the molecule transparency ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath246 , leads to the effective mass depending on @xmath247 . in both cases",
    "we have the renormalized detuning @xmath117 , and we arrive at the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polariton_h ] ) .",
    "as described in the main text the interaction of atoms via a single band edge leads to the effective interaction hamiltonian @xmath248 . for structures like the `` alligator '' photonic crystal waveguide described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bloch functions near the band edge are well approximated by the form @xmath249 , in which case if the atoms are trapped at sites commensurate with the band - edge wavelength we have @xmath250 .    if the atoms now interact via two distinct band edges , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : level_int](b ) , the interaction potential @xmath251 becomes the sum of the contributions from the upper ( @xmath149 ) and lower ( @xmath150 ) band edges , @xmath252 $ ] .",

    "[ fig : potential](a ) .",
    "we can now consider the loss introduced into our system for a single atom in the @xmath7 state as a by - product of creating the inter - atomic potential above .",
    "as discussed in the main text ( and in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the loss due to each band edge is the same as the loss that would result if the interaction were created by a cavity with the same parameters .",
    "in particular in the detuned regime @xmath257 , the loss from spontaneous emission @xmath258 and cavity decay @xmath44 occurs at rate approximately @xmath259 .",
    "this loss can then be minimized with respect to the interaction strength @xmath260 by adjusting the detuning , in which case the loss rate from each cavity for an atom in the @xmath7 state becomes @xmath261 for cavity cooperativity @xmath262 .",
    "we can further compare the rate of loss due to these effective cavities to the energy of the two photon bound state , which gives the rate of oscillation of photon molecule .",
    "the relation between the strengths of the individual potentials due to each band edge and the molecule energy @xmath191 depends on how the potentials add together and will depend on the desired shape and experimental constraints . as an example we consider the case where",
    "the band edges are arranged such that @xmath263 , in which case the contribution from the potential to the dressed state energy of individual atoms is zero .",
    "the potential is now @xmath264 $ ] and choosing for example @xmath265 a potential minimum occurs at @xmath266 with depth @xmath267 , which provides an upper limit on the energy of the two - photon molecule energy @xmath191 .",
    "optimizing the detunings as above we then find that the loss is @xmath268 with @xmath269 .    the potential we show in fig .",
