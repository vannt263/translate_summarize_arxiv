    "black holes are ` sighted ' everywhere in the universe these days . originally located in compact binary x - ray sources in the 1970 s , the cosmic presence of black holes",
    "has expanded considerably in recent decades .",
    "they now are believed to be the central engines that power quasars , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "they are identified in the cores of all bulge galaxies .",
    "they are presumed to form signficant populations of compact binaries , including black hole - black hole binaries ( bhbhs ) and black hole - neutron star binaries ( bhnss ) .",
    "black holes may even show up soon in the large hadron collider !",
    "gravitationally , black holes are strong - field objects whose properties are governed by einstein s theory of relativistic gravitation  general relativity .",
    "general relativistic simulations of gravitational collapse to black holes , bhbh mergers and recoil , black hole accretion , and other astrophysical phenomena involving black holes may help reveal how , when and where black holes form , grow and interact in the physical universe . as a consequence , such simulations can help identify the ways in which black holes can best be detected . to illustrate how our understanding of black hole phenomena is sharpend by large - scale simulations in general relativity , we summarize in this paper the results of several recent computational investigations .",
    "the first few involve the formation of black holes from stellar collapse , while the last one concerns supermassive black hole growth via disk accretion .",
    "most of these simulations utilize the tools of numerical relativity to solve einstein s field equations of general relativity .",
    "so we shall begin with a brief overview of this important , rapidly maturing field .",
    "most current work in numerical relativity is performed within the framework of the @xmath0 decomposition of einstein s field equations using some adaptation of the standard adm equations ( @xcite ) . in this framework spacetime",
    "is sliced up into a sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces of constant time @xmath1 , appropriate for solving an initial - value problem .",
    "consider two such time slices separated by an infinitesimal interval @xmath2 as shown in fig  [ adm ] .",
    "the spacetime metric measures the invariant interval between neighboring points @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the two slices according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spatial 3-metric on a time slice , @xmath7 is the lapse function determining the proper time between the slices as measured by a time - like normal observer @xmath8 at rest in the slice , and @xmath9 is the shift vector , a spatial 3-vector that describes the relabeling of the spatial coordinates of points in the slice .",
    "the gravitational field satisfies the hamiltonian and momentum _ constraint equations _ on each time slice , including the initial slice at @xmath10 : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the scalar curvature on the slice , @xmath13 is the 3-ricci tensor , @xmath14 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath15 is its trace , and @xmath16 is the covariant derivative operator on the slice .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass and momentum densities of the matter , respectively ; such matter source terms are formed by taking suitable projections of the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath19 with respect to the normal observer . included in this stress - energy tensor are contributions from all the nongravitational sources of mass - energy , which we are simply calling the `` matter '' ( e.g. , baryons , electromagnetic fields , neutrinos , etc . )",
    ".    a gravitational field satisfying the constraint equations on the initial slice can be determined at future times by integrating the _ evolution equations _ , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are additional matter source terms .",
    "the evolution equations guarantee that the field equations will automatically satisfy the constraints on all future time slices identically , provided they satisfy them on the initial slice .",
    "of course , this statement applies to the analytic set of equations and not necessarily to their numerical counterparts .",
    "note that the @xmath0 formalism prescribes no equations for @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "these four functions embody the four - fold gauge ( coordinate ) freedom inherent in general relativity .",
    "choosing them judiciously , especially in the presence of black holes , is one of the main challenges of numerical relativity .      during the past decade ,",
    "significant improvement in our ability to numerically integrate einstein s equations stably in full @xmath0 dimensions has been achieved by recasting the original adm system of equations .",
    "one such reformulation is the so - called bssn scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the physical metric and extrinsic curvature variables are replaced in favor of the conformal metric and extrinsic curvature , in the spirit of the `` york - lichnerowicz '' split ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath23 here a tilde @xmath24 denotes a conformal quantity and @xmath25 is the determinant of @xmath6 . at the same time , a connection function @xmath26 is introduced according to @xmath27 the quantities that are independently evolved in this scheme are now @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "the advantage is that the riemann operator appearing in the evolution equations ( cf .",
    "( [ dkdt ] ) ) takes on the form , @xmath29 thus the principal part of this operator , @xmath30 is that of a laplacian acting on the components of the metric @xmath31 .",
    "all the other second derivatives of the metric have been absorbed in the derivatives of the connection functions .",
    "the coupled evolution equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "( [ dgdt ] ) and ( [ dkdt ] ) then reduce essentially to a wave equation ,",
    "@xmath34 wave equations not only reflect the hyperbolic nature of general relativity , but can be implemented numerically in a straight - forward and stable manner . by now , numerous simulations have demonstrated the dramatically improved stability achieved in the bssn scheme over the standard adm equations , and considerable effort has gone into explaining the improvement on theoretical grounds [ see , e.g. , @xcite for discussion and references ] .",
    "many of the recent bhbh merger calculations have been performed using this scheme , beginning with @xcite and @xcite ( but see @xcite for an alternative approach ) .",
    "the same is true for the simulations described below .",
    "the protagonist of several different astrophysical scenarios probed by recent numerical simulations is a _ hypermassive _ star , typically a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) .",
    "a hypermassive star is an equilibrium fluid configuration that supports itself against gravitational collapse by _ differential _ rotation .",
    "uniform rotation can increase the maximum mass of a nonrotating , spherical equilibrium star by at most @xmath35 , but differential rotation can achieve a much higher increase ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical simulations using the bssn scheme demonstrate ( @xcite ) that hypermassive stars can be constructed that are _ dynamically _ stable , provided the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy , @xmath36 , is not too large ; for @xmath37 the configuration is subject to a nonaxisymmetric dynamical bar instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , all hypermassive stars are _ secularly _ unstable to the redistribution of angular angular momentum by viscosity , magnetic braking , gravitational radiation , or any other agent that dissipates internal shear .",
    "such a redistribution tends to drive a hypermassive star to uniform rotation , which can not support the mass against collapse .",
    "hence hypermassive stars are transient phenomena .",
    "their formation following , for example , a nsns merger , or core collapse in a massive , rotating star , may ultimately lead to a ` delayed ' collapse to a black hole on secular ( dissipative ) timescales .",
    "such a collapse will be accompanied inevitably by a delayed gravitional wave burst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the above scenario has become very relevant in light of the most recent and detailed simulations in full general relativity of nsns mergers .",
    "state - of - the - art , fully relativistic simulations of nsnss have been performed by shibata and his collaborators ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* shibata , taniguchi & ury= u 2003,2005 ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "they treat mass ratios @xmath39 in the range @xmath40 , consistent with the range of @xmath39 in observed binary pulsars with accurately determined masses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the key result is that there exists a critical mass @xmath41 of the binary system above which the merger leads to prompt collapse to a black hole , and below which the merger forms a hypermassive remnant . with the adopted eos ,",
    "the hmns remnant undergoes delayed collapse in about @xmath42 ms and emits a delayed gravitational wave burst .",

    "it is interesting that for the adopted eos , the mass @xmath44 is close to the value of the total mass found in each of the observed binary pulsars . given that the masses of the individual stars in a binary can be determined by measuring the gravitational wave signal emitted during the adiabatic , inspiral epoch prior to plunge and merger , the detection ( or absence ) of any quasiperiodic emission from the hypermassive remnant prior to delayed collapse may significantly constrain models of the nuclear eos .",
    "the possibility that a hmns remnant forms following a nsns merger had been foreshadowed in earlier newtonian simulations ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "triaxial equilibria can arise only in stars that can support sufficiently high values of @xmath36 exceeding the classical bifurcation point at @xmath45 ; reaching such high values requires eoss with adiabatic indicies exceeding @xmath46 in newtonian configurations , and comparable values in relativistic stars .",
    "it is not yet known whether the true nuclear eos in neutron stars is this stiff , or what agent for redistributing angular momentum in a hypermassive star dominates ( e.g. , magnetic fields , turbulent viscosity or gravitational radiation ) .",
    "but it is already evident that hypermassive stars are likely to form from some mergers and that they will survive many dynamical timescales before undergoing delayed collapse .",
    "the recent measurement ( @xcite ) of the mass of a neutron star in a neutron star - white dwarf binary of @xmath47 establishes an observational lower limit for the maximum mass of a neutron star ; such a high value suggests that mergers in typical nsnss may form hypermassive stars more often than undergoing prompt collapse .",
    "the hmnss found above may survive for many rotation periods .",
    "however , as we stated , on longer timescales magnetic fields will transport angular momentum and this will trigger gravitational collapse .",
    "two important magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanisms which transport angular momentum are magnetic braking ( @xcite ) and the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* balbus & hawley 1991,1998 ) ) .",
    "magnetic breaking transports angular momentum on the alfvn time scale , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the radius of the hmns .",
    "mri occurs wherever angular velocity @xmath50 decreases with cylindrical radius @xmath51 .",
    "this instability grows exponentially with an e - folding time of @xmath52 , independent of the field strength . for typical hmnss",
    "considered here , @xmath53",
    "the length scale of the fastest growing unstable mri modes , @xmath54 , does depend on the field strength : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "when the mri saturates , turbulence consisting of small - scale eddies often develops , leading to angular momentum transport on a timescale much longer than @xmath58 .",
    "the computational challenge of evolving an hmns is having sufficient spatial grid to resolve the mri wavelength and sufficient integration time to follow the evolution on the long alfvn timescale .    to determine the final fate of the hmns , it is necessary to carry out mhd simulations in full general relativity .",

    "the effects of mri are observed in an exponential growth of the poloidal field on the @xmath54 scale , a growth which saturates after a few rotation periods .",
    "the magnetic fields cause angular momentum to be transported outward , so that the core of the star contracts while the outer layers expand .",
    "after about 66 rotation periods , the core collapses to a black hole . using the technique of black hole excision ( see @xcite and references therein ) to remove the interior of the black hole , with its nasty spacetime singularity , and replace it with suitable boundary conditions on all the variables just inside the horizon , we continue the evolution to a quasi - stationary state .",

    "steady gas accretion will quickly drive the black hole to spin equilibrium , with a spin parameter that depends on the nature of the flow . if accretion occurs via a relativistic  standard thin disk \" , then the hole will be driven to the kerr limiting value , @xmath110 ( @xcite ) . correcting for the recapture of some of the emitted photons from such",
    "a disk reduces the equilibrium spin value to @xmath111 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if , however , the accretion is driven by mri turbulence in a relativistic mhd disk , then recent simulations indicate ( @xcite ) that the equilibrium spin will fall to @xmath112 .",
    "the small differences between these equilibrium spin parameters is deceptive , for they correspond to very different rest - mass - to - radiation conversion efficiencies , as shown in table  [ spin ] .",
    ".rest - mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency _ vs. _ black hole spin . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the significance of these different values is that the growth of a black hole with time via steady accretion depends _ exponentially _ , on the rest - mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency , @xmath113 , as we will now recall . define the rest - mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency @xmath113 and the luminosity efficiency @xmath114 according to @xmath115 where @xmath61 is the black hole mass , @xmath116 is the accreted rest - mass , and @xmath117 is the eddington luminosity given by @xmath118 here @xmath78 is the growth timescale , @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the mean molecular weight per electron . with the above definitions the growth rate of a black hole due to accretion is @xmath121 \\frac{m}{\\tau}\\ .\\ ] ] integrating equation  ( [ dmdt ] ) for steady accretion with constant efficiencies",

    "now a possible clue to the upper limit of @xmath114 is provided by the broad - line quasars in a sloan digital sky survey sample of 12,698 nearby quasars in the redshift interval @xmath123 .",
    "this survey supports the value @xmath124 as a physical upper limit ( @xcite ) . hence to maximize mass amplification via steady accretion , one must accrete with a small value of @xmath113 at the eddington limit , @xmath124 .",
    "[ accrete ] evaluates equation  ( [ amp ] ) for black hole seeds that form at redshift @xmath125 from the collapse of pop iii stars in the range @xmath126 , and subsequently grow to @xmath127 by @xmath95",
    ". the @xmath97cdm concordance cosmological model is assumed .",
    "of particular relevance is the case of `` merger - assisted '' mass amplification , whereby mergers account for a typical growth of @xmath128 in black hole mass , the remainder being by gas accretion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the figure shows that for @xmath129 , the required growth of the seed to smbh status is easily achieved for a relativistic mhd accretion disk , but is only marginally possible for a standard thin disk that accounts for photon recapture , and not at all possible for a standard thin disk that drives the black hole to maximal spin .",
    "however , if the initial black hole seed is less than @xmath130 , accretion via a standard thin disk appears to be ruled out altogether .",
    "the fact that a black hole driven to spin equilibrium by a turbulent mhd disk accretes with low enough efficiency to grow to supermassive size by @xmath131 is potentially significant .",
    "it points to the need for further relativistic mhd simulations of black hole accretion with ever greater physical sophistication , including the full effects of radiation transfer .",
    "these same conclusions also hold if the black hole seed forms much earlier than @xmath132 , and they may be tightened if the seed forms later . in fact , it may be likely that the seed forms later , at @xmath133 , given that even @xmath134 peaks in the density perturbation spectrum for the progenitor halo of sdss 1148 + 5251 do not collapse until @xmath135 in the @xmath97cdm concordance cosmology ( see , e.g. figure 5 in @xcite . ) moreover , the potential wells of the earliest halos are quite shallow ( @xmath136 km / s ) and may not be able to retain enough gas to form stars . nevertheless , the effect of altering the date of birth of the black hole seed is not very great unless @xmath137 , as is evident from fig .",
    "3 .     versus redshift @xmath125 of the initial seed . here",
    "we plot the amplification achieved by redshift @xmath138 , the highest known quasar redshift , corresponding to 1148 + 5251 .",
    "each solid curve is labeled by the adopted constant radiation efficiency , @xmath113 ; the luminosity is assumed to be the eddington value ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines bracket the range of amplification required for accretion alone to grow a seed black hole of mass @xmath140 formed from the collapse of a pop iii star to @xmath127 .",

    "the analysis presented here is illustrative only ; the results may change as the treatment is refined .",
    "the main point of this example is to emphasize that our understanding of structure formation in the early universe as it pertains to the formation and growth of supermassive black holes ( global physics ) depends in part on resolving some of the important details of relativistic bhbh recoil and relativistic black hole accretion ( local physics ) . to understand these details , in turn , requires large - scale simulations in full general relativity , which are now possible and underway .",
    "we have discussed a number of black hole scenarios that require numerical simulations in full general relativity for true understanding . some of these processes involve the formation of black holes , others concern their subsequent growth and interactions .",
    "the important point is that numerical relativity is at last mature enough to probe these issues reliably .",
    "numerical relativity can now serve as an important tool to simulate stellar collapse to black holes , the inspiral , merger and recoil of bhbhs , nsnss and bhnss , the generation of gravitational waves from stellar collapse and binary mergers , accretion onto black holes , and countless other phenomena involving black holes and their strong gravitational fields .",
    "with such a tool , these processes now can be investigated at a fundamental level without many of the ad hoc assumptions and approximations required in previous treatments .",
