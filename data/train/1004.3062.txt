    "the nuclear emc effect in the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) has been discussed since early 1980s starting from the observation of a dramatic change in the structure function of a heavy nucleus relative to that of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "the nuclear effects in dis were experimentally measured in the form of the ratio @xmath11 of the structure functions ( or the cross sections ) of two nuclei ( usually a complex nucleus to deuterium ) in the experiments at cern @xcite , slac @xcite , desy @xcite , fnal @xcite .",
    "the data were taken for different nuclear targets and at different regions of the bjorken @xmath12 and the invariant momentum transfer squared @xmath13 and significant nuclear effects were observed ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the e03 - 103 experiment at jlab published a high - statistics measurements of the emc effect for @xmath14he , @xmath15he , @xmath16be , and @xmath17c , nuclei emphasizing the region of large @xmath12 @xcite . in this article",
    "we discuss the statistical consistency of data sets from different experiments collected with the same nuclear targets in the region @xmath18 , focusing on the kinematical region and the targets used in the e03 - 103 experiment .",
    "we also study the sensitivity of the data on the emc effect in @xmath14he to the modeling of the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "a quantitative understanding the nuclear effects in dis is important for a number of reasons .",
    "a proper interpretation of experimental data can provide valuable insights into the origin of nuclear force and helps us to understand how the properties of hadrons modify in a nuclear medium .",
    "it should be also noted that the nuclear data often serve as the source of information on hadrons otherwise not directly accessible .",
    "a typical example is the extraction of the neutron structure function which is usually obtained from deuterium and proton data and requires a detailed knowledge of nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "other examples include the using of charged - lepton and neutrino nuclear data in global qcd fits aiming to better determine the proton and neutron parton distribution functions and the higher twist terms @xcite .",
    "understanding the nuclear effects is particularly relevant for precision measurements in neutrino physics , where heavy nuclear targets are used in order to collect a significant number of interactions .    a quantitative model for nuclear structure functions",
    "was recently developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "this approach accounts for a number of nuclear effects including nuclear fermi motion and binding ( fmb ) , nuclear pion excess , shadowing , and off - shell correction to bound nucleon structure functions .",
    "the detailed analysis of data published before 1996 on the ratios @xmath19 for a wide region of nuclear targets shows a good performance of the model which was able to describe the observed @xmath20 , and @xmath21 dependencies  @xcite . in the present article",
    "we compare the predictions of our model with the recent data from hermes  @xcite and e03 - 103  @xcite experiments and discuss the role of different nuclear corrections in light nuclei .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we outline the model used in our studies . in sec.[sec : discus ] we discuss the data from different experiments and also confront the results of our calculation with data . in sec.[sec : sum ] we summarize the results .",
    "we recall that while dis is characterized by a large invariant momentum transfer @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the nucleon mass , the characteristic longitudinal distance in the target rest frame @xmath24 is not small in hadronic scale ( see , , ref.@xcite ) . in nuclei ,",
    "the comparison between @xmath25 and an average distance between bound nucleons @xmath26 gives the characteristic regions of the bjorken variable @xmath12 , which are goverened by different nuclear effects .",
    "as @xmath27fm , at large values of @xmath12 we have @xmath28 and nuclear dis can be approximated by the incoherent scattering off the bound protons and neutrons ( impulse approximation , or ia ) . in this region",
    "the major nuclear corrections are due to nuclear binding and nucleon momentum distribution ( fermi motion ) . at small values of @xmath12",
    "the longitudinal distance @xmath25 becomes large and the ia is difficult to justify . in this region the corrections due to scattering off nuclear pions ( meson exchange currents ) , as well as",
    "the nuclear ( anti-)shadowing effect due to coherent multiple interactions of hadronic component of virtual intermediate boson with bound nucleons , become important .",
    "summarizing , for the nuclear structure function we have different contributions ( to be specific we discuss @xmath29 , for more detail see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath30 where the first term in the right - hand side stands for the impulse approximation , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the corrections due to scattering off the nuclear pion ( meson ) field and the coherent interaction of the intermediate virtual boson with the nuclear target , respectively .",
    "the ia term dominates at large @xmath12 .",
    "this term can be written as a sum of the proton ( @xmath33 ) and the neutron ( @xmath34 ) contributions @xcite : @xmath35      { \\mathcal p}^\\tau(\\varepsilon,\\bm{p})\\ ,          \\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma",
    "p_z}{m}\\right ) \\left({\\gamma'}^2 + \\frac{6{x'}^2 \\bm{p}_\\perp^2}{q^2 } \\right ) f_2^\\tau(x',q^2,p^2 ) , \\label{ia}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration is taken over the four - momentum of the bound nucleon @xmath36 and @xmath37={\\mathrm{d}}{\\varepsilon}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}^3\\bm{p}/(2\\pi)^4 $ ] . in the integrand",
    ", @xmath38 is the proton ( neutron ) nuclear spectral function , which describes the energy and momentum distribution of bound nucleons , @xmath39 is the structure function of bound proton ( neutron ) , which depends on the bjorken variable @xmath40 the momentum transfer square @xmath13 and also on the nucleon invariant mass squared @xmath41 . in eq.([ia ] ) we use the coordinate system in which the momentum transfer @xmath42 is antiparallel to the @xmath43 axis , @xmath44 is the transverse component of the nucleon momentum , and @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ".    nuclei typically have different proton and neutron numbers .",
    "for this reason the nuclear structure functions generally have both the isoscalar and the isovector contributions . in order to separate the isoscalar and isovector contributions in eq.([ia ] ) , we introduce the isoscalar @xmath47 and the isovector @xmath48 spectral functions .",
    "the spectral function @xmath49 is normalized to the total nucleon number @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the proton and neutron number , respectively , and @xmath53 is normalized to @xmath54 .",
    "we separate the normalizations from the spectral functions and write    [ spfn:01 ] @xmath55    where the reduced spectral functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are both normalized to unity . using eq.([spfn:01 ] ) we explicitly write the nuclear structure function in eq.([ia ] ) in terms of the isoscalar and the isovector contributions @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the structure function of the isoscalar nucleon and @xmath60 and the parameter @xmath61 describes the fractional difference of protons and neutrons in a nucleus .",
    "the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the contracted notations of the integration in eq.([ia ] ) taken with the reduced spectral functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the model of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which is used in this article for nuclei with @xmath66 , is discussed in sec.[sec : spfn ] .",
    "we also note that for @xmath1he we apply eq.([ia ] ) with the proton and neutron spectral functions taken from microscopic calculations of refs.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the experimental data on the nuclear emc effect have been often presented for the isoscalar part of the nuclear structure functions in order to facilitate comparison between different nuclei . in order to separate the isoscalar part from nuclear data ,",
    "a common practice is to multiply the data by a factor @xmath67 that accounts for the proton - neutron difference in a nuclear target . indeed , neglecting nuclear effects we have from eq.([nuke : fa ] ) @xmath68 .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that this method is only an approximate way to isolate the isoscalar contribution to the structure functions , as a correct procedure should involve the details of the proton and neutron distributions in nuclei .",
    "also , it is important to realize that the data are biased by this procedure as the factor @xmath69 depends on the neutron structure function through the ratio @xmath8 and different experiments employ different models of this ratio . for this reason",
    "the comparison between theoretical calculations and data is not clear - cut for nonisoscalar nuclei .",
    "apparently , a consistent comparison between data and calculations for nonisoscalar nuclei should involve unbiased data .",
    "however , in practice it is not always possible to remove the isoscalar correction from data of specific experiments .",
    "the nuclear spectral function @xmath70 describes the energy and momentum distributions of bound nucleons and can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are creation and annihilation operators of the nucleon with momentum @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the energy of the nuclear state @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "note that we discuss unpolarized scattering and in eq.([eq : spfn ] ) we implicitly assume the sum over nucleon polarizations . for simplicity",
    ", we also suppress explicit notations for the nucleon isospin state ( proton or neutron ) of @xmath70 and the operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "note also that eq.([eq : spfn ] ) is written in the target rest frame and defines the nuclear spectral function as a function of nucleon energy @xmath80 and momentum @xmath74 . however , in the literature the spectral function is usually considered as a function of the nucleon separation energy @xmath81 . the spectral function in this case is denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "the relation between @xmath83 and @xmath82 is driven by a relation between @xmath84 and @xmath81 , which differ by the kinetic energy of a recoil nuclear system of @xmath85 nucleons , @xmath86 ( for more details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a common way to calculate the spectral function is to insert a full set of the intermediate states in eq.([eq : spfn ] ) and evaluate the sum of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements . in the case of the deuteron",
    ", the intermediate states reduce to a free proton or neutron , and the spectral function is given entirely in terms of the deuteron wave function square and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 the deuteron binding energy ( the explicit form of eq.([ia ] ) in this case is given in ref.@xcite ) .    for a @xmath1he nucleus ,",
    "the proton spectral function receives two contributions : from the bound @xmath89 intermediate state corresponding to a deuteron , where the separation energy is @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the @xmath1he binding energy ; and from the @xmath89 continuum scattering states .",
    "the neutron spectral function , on the other hand , has only the @xmath92 continuum contribution :    [ eq : spfn3he ] @xmath93    a number of calculations of @xmath1he spectral function is available . in ref.@xcite",
    "this spectral function was obtained by solving the faddeev equation with the paris @xmath94 potential @xcite for the ground state wave function , and constructing its projection onto the deuteron and two - body continuum states . in ref.@xcite",
    "the spectral function was obtained using a variational @xmath1he wave function calculated for a more recent av14 @xmath94 potential .",
    "while in our numerical analysis we use the spectral functions from ref.@xcite , we verified that both ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite lead to a consistent @xmath95(@xmath14he/@xmath0h ) ratio .. for @xmath96 and @xmath13 values of the e03 - 103 experiment , the calculation with the spectral function of ref.@xcite gives @xmath95(@xmath14he/@xmath0h ) larger by some 12% .",
    "for the spectral function of ref.@xcite we used a more recent results with av18 and urbana ix potential ( g.  salme , private communication ) .",
    "]    for @xmath97 nuclei we follow the model of ref.@xcite , in which the full nuclear spectral function was calculated as a sum of the mean - field spectral function , describing a low - energy part of the separation energy spectrum , and the term generated by short - range @xmath94 correlations in the nuclear ground state responsible for a high separation energy and high - momentum component .",
    ".the nuclear binding energy per nucleon @xmath98 , a bound nucleon energy @xmath84 and kinetic energy @xmath99 averaged with the nuclear spectral function normalized to one nucleon ( all in mev units ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section",
    "we study the consistency of data from different experiments . from fig.[fig : rdat ] we can conclude that the slopes of the emc ratio as a function of @xmath12 from different experiments are in a good agreement .",
    "note that the beam energy of these experiments differs significantly . as the beam energy determines the range of possible @xmath13 values for each @xmath12-bin , the typical @xmath13 values of the nmc experiment are significantly higher than those of the slac e139 , hermes , and jlab e03 - 103 experiments",
    "nevertheless , the data show no systematic @xmath13 dependence of @xmath95 in the valence region @xmath100 .",
    "contrary to the slope , the overall normalization factors of different experiments are not fully consistent . if we consider the @xmath4c and @xmath5n nuclei , which have a similar atomic number , we observe a good agreement in the normalizations of the nmc , slac e139 , and hermes experiments .",
    "however , the data points of the jlab e03 - 103 experiment are somewhat shifted above the data from other experiments .",
    "a similar trend is also present for the other nuclei , as can be seen from fig.[fig : rdat ] .",
    "it is interesting to observe that for the double ratio ( @xmath16be/@xmath0h)/(@xmath17c/@xmath0h ) the normalization of the e03 - 103 data seems to agree with the slac e139 and nmc data .",
    "this fact points toward a common normalization offset for all ratios , possibly related to a common source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "it should be noted that the overall normalization uncertainty is not shown in fig.[fig : rdat ] but is summarized in table  [ tab : norm ] .",
    "the nmc experiment achieved the most precise absolute normalization within 0.4% , followed by the slac e139 experiment .",
    "for this reason we try to use nmc data as a reference and we evaluate the consistency of other experiments with nmc . from fig.[fig : rdat ] we can see that the statistical uncertainties of nmc data become large at @xmath101 and therefore we can have an accurate comparison only in the region @xmath102",
    ". following this observation , we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we study the consistency of slac e139 and hermes data with nmc in this overlap region .",
    "then we compare the e03 - 103 data with slac e139 data since those two experiments have a broader overlap region for @xmath101 .    in order to evaluate the compatibility in the overall normalization factors of different experiments we follow a @xmath6 approach .",
    "we consider the data shown in fig.[fig : rdat ] in the region @xmath18 and we rebin the measurements with a common bin size of 0.1/bin ( six bins in total from 0.1 to 0.7 ) . within each larger bin , we calculate the weighted average of the data points from each experiments with weights given by @xmath103 .",
    "for each pair of experiments , we then calculate the corresponding @xmath6 in the overlap region assuming a fixed normalization , as reported by the experiments .",
    "the results are summarized in tables  [ tab : slac - norm ] and  [ tab : jlab - norm ] . from table  [",
    "tab : slac - norm ] we can conclude that the three experiments nmc , slac e139 and hermes appear to be statistically compatible in the absolute normalization . however , the picture differs substantially for the e03 - 103 experiment .",
    "the jlab kinematics largely overlaps with the slac e139 experiment and for this reason we calculate the overall @xmath6 between these two measurements .",
    "the results shown in table  [ tab : jlab - norm ] signal on inconsistency in the normalization of data from these experiments .",
    "we found that an overall normalization factor of @xmath104 , applied to the @xmath15he/@xmath0h , @xmath16be/@xmath0h , and @xmath17c/@xmath0h data of the e03 - 103 experiment , makes them statistically compatible with the slac e139 data , lowering @xmath6 by @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , in the following comparisons we will apply an overall normalization factor of 0.98 to the measurements @xmath15he/@xmath0h , @xmath16be/@xmath0h and @xmath17c/@xmath0h from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : hermes ] shows a comparison of our calculations with hermes data @xcite and also @xmath4c/@xmath0h data from nmc experiment .",
    "these data emphasize the region of small @xmath12 where the major nuclear correction is due to nuclear shadowing .",
    "we found a good agreement of model calculations with data over the whole kinematical region of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that the shadowing effect arise in our model due to medium effects in the propagation of hadronic component of the virtual photon in nuclear environment .",
    "the magnitude of the shadowing effect is driven by the total cross section of scattering of hadronic component off a bound nucleon .",
    "this quantity strongly depends on @xmath13 in the region of low @xmath13  @xcite , which is the underlying reason for the difference in the shadowing correction for the nmc and hermes data in fig.[fig : hermes ] .",
    "we note that characteristic @xmath13 are significantly smaller for the hermes experiment .",
    "for example , in the @xmath12-bin @xmath106 the average @xmath13 is @xmath107 for nmc and about @xmath108 for hermes .",
    "it should be also noted that pqcd and the twist expansion approach employed in eq.([eq : sf ] ) is out of the region of applicability for such low values of @xmath13 . in order to evaluate the structure functions and their ratios at low @xmath13",
    ", we apply the spline extrapolation of eq.([eq : sf ] ) from the region @xmath109 to @xmath110 using the requirements from the conservation of the electromagnetic current @xcite .",
    "we also note that a bump in the emc ratio between @xmath111 and 0.3 is due to an interplay between the nuclear shadowing and pion correction effects .    in fig.[fig :",
    "e03103 ] we show a detailed comparison of our predictions with the e03 - 103 data for the ratios @xmath2he/@xmath0h , @xmath3be/@xmath0h , and @xmath4c/@xmath0h . for each @xmath12 bin ,",
    "the ratios of nuclear cross sections were calculated at the average @xmath13 value provided by the e03 - 103 experiment  @xcite .",
    "after applying the normalization factor of 0.98 , required to match the nmc , e139 and hermes data , we observe a very good agreement between our model and the e03 - 103 experiment for @xmath112 .",
    "table  [ tab : chisq - jlab ] lists the results of calculation of @xmath6 between the model predictions and the data with and without renormalization . as a cross check",
    ", we also list the values of a normalization factor minimizing @xmath6 if we leave the normalization floating for each of the three ratios @xmath2he/@xmath0h , @xmath3be/@xmath0h , and @xmath4c/@xmath0h from the e03 - 103 experiment .",
    "note that the 2% offset appears statistically compatible with the overall normalization uncertainties quoted by the e03 - 103 experiment .",
    "indeed , if we keep fixed the jlab normalization and we rather add the corresponding normalization uncertainties into the @xmath6 calculation , we obtain a normalized @xmath6 of 1.17 .",
    "we also remark that allowing the normalizations to float reduces the @xmath6/dof to significantly less than unity that may signal an issue with the quoted uncertainties on the data .    in the region of @xmath96 our calculations",
    "somewhat underpredict the e03 - 103 data .",
    "we note that in this region the data of ref.@xcite have @xmath113 and therefore lie within the resonance region , while in our calculations we use a dis model for the structure functions .",
    "although we verified the consistency of low-@xmath114 dis structure functions with the duality principle , a more detailed comparison would require explicit resonance model for the structure functions .",
    "furthermore , the region of @xmath96 is very sensitive to the treatment of both the bound nucleon momentum distribution and the target mass correction to the nucleon structure functions  @xcite . in our model , we apply the target mass correction following a commonly used method of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the target mass correction of ref.@xcite leads to an incorrect behavior of sf in the limit of @xmath115 that has a significant impact on the calculation of nuclear ratio @xmath116 at very large @xmath12 values .",
    "we also note that in the detailed comparison with the data the quasielastic contribution , which is not addressed in this article , may not be negligible in this region .",
    "finally , fig.[fig : e03103 ] shows the results obtained with and without ( @xmath117 ) off - shell correction .",
    "we recall that the off - shell function @xmath118 was determined in the former analysis of data @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the off - shell correction plays a crucial role in understanding the data , implying the emc effect is largely driven by the modification of properties of the bound nucleons inside the nuclei .      here",
    "we discuss nuclear effects in the @xmath1he target and futher address the problem of consistency between data from different experiments .",
    "the emc effect in the @xmath1he nucleus was measured by hermes  @xcite and recently at jlab  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the data are presented in a form corrected for the proton  neutron difference in a nucleus , as discussed in sec.[sec : model ] .",
    "the isoscalar correction depends on the ratio @xmath8 and for this reason a direct comparison of corrected data is biased by the models used in different experiments .",
    "the uncorrected data on the emc ratios are available from ref.@xcite and comparison with those data allows us to reduce a bias associated with the isoscalar correction .    in the former discussion we addressed possible inconsistency in the normalization of the emc ratios from different experiments .",
    "below we discuss the relation between the ratios @xmath119 and @xmath120 and @xmath8 , and will argue that the comparison of the @xmath8 ratio extracted from @xmath14he/@xmath0h data of the e03 - 103 experiment  @xcite and the @xmath0h/@xmath9h data by nmc  @xcite provides a sensitive test of the normalization of the @xmath14he/@xmath0h data .    in the absense of nuclear effects , the ratio @xmath8 can directly be calculated from either the @xmath0h/@xmath9h or @xmath1he/@xmath0h ratio .",
    "a realistic analysis should include the treatment of nuclear effects .",
    "let us first consider the ratio @xmath0h/@xmath9h . in order to address the nuclear corrections in this problem ,",

    "thus , a significantly larger value of @xmath146 for @xmath2he explains more pronounced off - shell effect in this nucleus .",
    "we presented a detailed analysis of nuclear emc effect for light nuclei . focusing on the overlap region",
    "@xmath18 , we perform a statistical @xmath6 analysis of the consistency between the data sets from different experiments .",
    "we found a good agreement between the normalizations of the nmc , slac e139 and hermes experiments for nuclei with @xmath97 .",
    "however , the points from the jlab e013 - 103 experiment appear systematically shifted above the slac e139 data by an overall normalization factor of @xmath104 , common to all discussed nuclei with @xmath97 .",
    "this renormalization factor is statistically consistent with the normalization uncertainty quoted in ref.@xcite . after applying",
    "the normalization offset the jlab e013 - 103 data are in good agreement with both slac e139 and nmc data .",
    "the predictions of ref.@xcite are in a good agreement with renormalized e013 - 103 data for all studied nuclei , as discussed in sec.[sec : comparison ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize an important role of off - shell correction , which is crucial in the description of both the slope of @xmath147 for @xmath148 and position of its minimum at @xmath149 .",
    "this correction is controlled by a product @xmath150 averaged with the nuclear spectral function . the function",
    "@xmath151 measures a relative change in the nucleon structure function due to variation of its invariant mass . in ref.@xcite",
    "this function was phenomenologically derived from a data analysis on nuclear ratios @xmath152 .",
    "further interpretation of observed behavior of @xmath151 in terms of detailed models would help to better understand mechanisms of modification of the partonic structure of the nucleon in nuclear environment .",
    "the hermes data on @xmath5n are consistent with the nmc data on @xmath4c at @xmath153 .",
    "the predictions by ref.@xcite agree with both experiments .",
    "we observe that at small @xmath12 the shadowing effect is more pronounced in the hermes data than in the nmc data .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the @xmath13 dependence , since the average @xmath13 of the hermes experiment is significantly lower than the corresponding one of the nmc experiment .",
    "this effect is also confirmed by calculations in a model of ref.@xcite .",
    "a significant part of the present analysis is devoted to the study of the emc effect in @xmath1he , for which the data from both hermes and jlab e03 - 103 experiments are available . in the overlap region at @xmath132 the normalizations of the two experiments somewhat disagree .",
    "it is important to note that the data on nuclear ratios are usually corrected for the proton excess , which depends on the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , the data appear to be biased by different models of the isoscalarity correction . in order to verify the consistency of data , we study the relation between the ratios of nuclear structure functions and @xmath8 .",
    "we extract @xmath8 from both the e03 - 103 data on the @xmath1he/@xmath0h ratio and the nmc data on the @xmath0h/@xmath9h ratio . a significant difference between the results of these two extractions",
    "is observed . in particular",
    ", we find that at @xmath133 and @xmath154 the ratio @xmath8 obtained from the jlab e03 - 103 data is about 15% larger than that extracted from the nmc data .",
    "both extractions of @xmath8 become consistent once a normalization factor of @xmath137 is applied to the @xmath1he/@xmath0h ratio of the e03 - 103 experiment . after such renormalization",
    "the e03 - 103 and hermes data on the @xmath14he/@xmath0h ratio also become consistent , and our predictions are in good agreement with both data sets in the region @xmath112 .",
    "we thank j. arrington , a. daniel and d. gaskell for useful communications and information on the e03 - 103 experiment and c. riedl for useful information on the hermes data .",
    "we are also grateful to s. alekhin , w. melnichouk and s. scopetta for fruitful discussions and communications .",
