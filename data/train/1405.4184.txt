    "the first and second parts of this series of papers ( @xcite and @xcite , hereafter papers i and ii ) described a new method to determine the fundamental parameters of spherically pulsating stars with large amplitude , e.g. of rr lyrae ( hereafter rr ) stars .",
    "the method is purely photometric : brightness and colour indices of atlas atmospheric models @xcite are compared with those from multicolour observations and the obtained physical parameters of the atmosphere are used in hydrodynamic equations for the pulsating atmosphere .",
    "finally , the equations are solved for their parameters : stellar mass @xmath4 and distance @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters like the reddening @xmath6 toward the star and atmospheric metallicity @xmath7 $ ] are determined from shock - free phases .",
    "the variable physical parameters like the effective temperature @xmath8 , effective gravity @xmath9 , and stellar angular radius @xmath10 are obtained for all phases in the frame of quasi - static atmosphere approximation ( qsaa ) , where @xmath11 is the radius of zero optical depth , @xmath12 is the time .",
    "the method was applied for the rrab star su dra ( paper i ) and after some technical refinements for the double - mode ( dm ) stars v500 hya ( = gsc4868 - 0831 ) and v372 ser ( paper ii ) .",
    "the main trend in the research of rr or other spherically pulsating stars with large amplitude is nowadays to use them as distance indicators and calibrating their astrophysical parameters ( e.g. metallicity ) from parameters like fourier parameters of the light curve in an easily accessible broad photometric band .",
    "simple fitting formulae are sought expressing the connection between data derived from the photometry in one band and the astrophysical parameters originating from involved theoretical considerations and computations .",
    "this is essentially a statistical approach .",
    "we emphasize the astrophysical character of the method presented in this series of papers .",
    "we should like to understand better the response of the stellar atmosphere for the pulsational waves originating from the layers deeply below the atmosphere .",
    "we do it in the frame of our photometric - hydrodynamic method which is formulated in one spatial dimension as well as the present theories of stellar pulsation .",
    "we use the full colour information of a multicolour photometry ( e.g. _ ubv(ri)@xmath0 _ in this series of papers ) .",
    "the fundamental parameters are obtained without spectroscopic observations .",
    "it is crucial to use the information content of the ultraviolet part of the spectrum because reliable astrophysical parameters of these stars can only be obtained if the _ u _ band is included in the comparison of the observations and theoretical atmospheric models .",
    "our method is pioneering in making use the laws of mass and momentum conservation in a pulsating atmosphere .",
    "it opened a completely new way to obtain simultaneously the mass and distance of the star .",
    "this concluding paper of the series reports _ ubv(ri)@xmath0 _ photometric observations and presents the new results for the fundamental parameters of the stars sw and , dh peg , cu com , dy peg , respectively .",
    "sections 2 and 3 report the observations and the reductions .",
    "the results of the photometry are presented in section 4 .",
    "metallicity , reddening derived from the colour indices of the shock - free epochs , the variable physical parameters , mass and distance to the stars , a brief insight in the dynamics of the atmosphere are given in section 5 .",
    "the main results ( mass , distance etc . ) from papers i and ii are also included in the tables .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "these sections summarise the results of papers i and ii as well and the appraisal of our method .",
    "a limitation in many previous photometric studies on these variables is that the light and colour curves were frequently obtained by folding observations over a long time ( @xmath13 ) @xcite or one cycle was observed only @xcite .",
    "we observed segments in the johnson - cousins _",
    "ubv(ri)@xmath0 _ light curves as long as it was allowed by the sky conditions and length of a night .",
    "our light curves cover the period at least three times and we have the _ ubv(ri)@xmath0 _ magnitudes for each observed star in more than 200 epochs distributed uniformly over the cycle . to our knowledge",
    "the photometry reported here is the largest homogeneous observational material in the johnson - cousins system containing the _ u _ band .",
    "the wealth of this material allows us to discover some hitherto unknown details of the variability , e. g. cycle to cycle variations .",
    "the observations were collected with the iac80 telescope of the teide observatory and the 1-m rcc telescope mounted at piszkstet mountain station of the konkoly observatory of the hungarian academy of sciences .",
