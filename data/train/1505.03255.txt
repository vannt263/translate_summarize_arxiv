    "observations of millisecond pulsars demonstrate that some neutron stars ( nss ) rotate very rapidly ( the fastest known pulsar psr j1748 - 2446ad has spin frequency @xmath6  hz ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , as was shown by @xcite and @xcite , rapidly rotating nss are subject to gravitation - driven instability associated with enhancement of r - modes ( toroidal oscillation mode of rotating star controlled by coriolis force ) .",
    "it is a particular case of the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability [ @xcite ] .",
    "r - mode instability probably plays an important role in ns physics .",
    "indeed , it is argued to be a mechanism which limits pulsars spin frequencies ( @xcite ) .",
    "rapidly rotating hot nss , observed in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , can be affected by r - mode instability even more profoundly : some of these stars should be unstable within the standard model of r - mode oscillations ( see @xcite ; @xcite , for example ) and their existence provides one with a good opportunity to test microphysical models of ns s core ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest that r - mode instability can support a new class of rapidly rotating nss , which do not accrete matter from companion even transiently ( as nss in lmxbs ) , but still keep high temperature via r - mode instability",
    ". some of these nss might have been already observed , but erroneously classified as quiescent lmxb candidates ( see @xcite for detailed discussion ) . finally , as argued by @xcite",
    ", r - mode instability can be also important for generation of ns magnetic fields .",
    "the main aim of the paper is to discuss the role , which magnetic field plays in nonlinear evolution of r - modes and role of r - modes in magnetic field evolution in nss .",
    "most of the papers discussing r - modes in nss either neglect magnetic field or simply mention that it can be important",
    ". indeed , dipolar magnetic field of rapidly rotating nss ( @xmath7  hz ) is not very large @xmath8  g and seems to be clearly negligible ( see @xcite and sec .  [",
    "sec : mag ] ) .",
    "recent papers ( @xcite , for instance ) confirm by detailed numerical calculations that only very high magnetic field can affect r - modes strongly [ for example ( see fig . 7 by @xcite ) ,",
    "magnetic field @xmath9  g modifies r - mode frequency for a less than for a one percent for @xmath10  hz ] .",
    "however , just after r - mode instability was discovered , @xcite pointed that r - modes are able to increase seeding magnetic field through secular drift of fluid elements , which takes place within second order ( in oscillation amplitude ) perturbation theory .",
    "they argue that this mechanism can be responsible for generation of strong magnetic fields in nss , but at the same time it finally suppresses r - mode instability .",
    "a strong support for these results was provided by subsequent papers , which claim differential rotation , i.e. secular drift of fluid elements , to be a necessary feature of r - modes ( in nonmagnetized ns ) on the base of analytical ( @xcite ) and numerical calculations ( see @xcite , for example ) .    in this paper",

    "however , an important point of these papers , namely that `` differential rotation , producing large scale drifts of fluid elements along stellar latitudes , is an unavoidable feature of r - modes in the nonlinear theory '' ( see abstract in @xcite ) is not true : we present a parameter set for analytical second order solution obtained by @xcite with vanishing secular drift ( below we refer to it as to `` non - drifting solution '' ) . for details ) . ]",
    "we argue that existence of second order solution with vanishing drift is not coincidental feature , specific for r - modes only , but rather is a general property of oscillation modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mag ] we reconsider the effect of magnetic field on r - modes in second order in amplitude by accurate treatment of magnetic stresses within ideal magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "@xcite argued that r - mode velocity profile is not affected by magnetic field up to @xmath11  g. assuming secular drift to be unaffected , they conclude that r - modes enhance magnetic field due to differential rotation , associated with drift . as it is stressed by @xcite ( sec .",
    "3.14.5 ) , the twist of magnetic field caused by inhomogeneous rotation , propagates along magnetic lines of force with alfvn velocity @xmath12 , thus if rotation inhomogeneity is too small , the force lines will have enough time to straighten up .",
    "as a result , to produce significant field by differential rotation , relative velocity of different parts of the star should be at least comparable with alfvn velocity .",
    "however , this point was not discussed by @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", they suppose that arbitrary small secular drift can enhance magnetic field . ]",
    "we demonstrate that non - drifting solution is indeed unaffected by magnetic field up to @xmath13  g , but it does not lead to secular evolution of magnetic field .",
    "however , in a general second order solution the second order velocity profile stays unaffected by magnetic field only for a timescale much less then the alfvn timescale ( while back - reaction of magnetic field can be neglected ) . on the contrary , at the alfvn timescale the drift contribution to the second order velocity profile ( corresponding to arbitrary stationary differential rotation ) is modified by magnetic field [ back - reaction is crucial and can not be neglected for the same reasons as why stationary differential rotation is forbidden in magnetized stars ( ferraro s law of isorotation ) ] . to describe back - reaction properly ,",
    "we demonstrate that general second order r - mode solution in a magnetized ns with @xmath14 can be presented as a superposition of two independent solutions of mhd equations : ( a ) solution which describes evolution of differential rotation in nonoscillating magnetized ns ( _ drift solution _ , which describes evolution of secular drift ) , and ( b ) non - drifting r - mode solution .",
    "these solutions are decoupled ( at second order in oscillation amplitude ) as far as eulerian perturbations of all quantities ( except magnetic field ) in drift solution are second order in amplitude of non - drifting r - mode solution .",
    "evolution of the drift solution is governed by the same equations as in _ non - oscillating _",
    "magnetized ns , thus it evolves at alfvn timescale ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "secular evolution of the magnetic field is solely determined by the drift , thus initial energy of differential rotation provides an upper bound for the increase of magnetic field energy .",
    "furthermore , energy of the non - drifting mode is conserved in the leading order . as a result",

    "* homogeneous part of equations ( [ sec_nonmag1]-[sec_nonmag3 ] ) have the same form as linearized equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ lin_nonmag1]-[lin_nonmag3 ] ) ] .",
    "thus , evolution of all quantities in arbitrary solution of homogeneous equations is the same as for ( linear ) perturbations of initial ( nonoscillating ) state .",
    "thus , with accuracy up to the second order in @xmath4 , one can select an arbitrary partial solution of the oscillation equations and present a general solution as composition of selected oscillating solution and solution , which describes arbitrary initial @xmath44 perturbations , evolving in a same way as in nonoscillating ns .",
    "in fact , it is obvious even without explicit equations , since second order perturbations can neither affect oscillation solution nor be affected by it ( within @xmath45 accuracy ) .",
    "let s restrict subsequent consideration to nonoscillating solutions of homogeneous eqs.([sec_nonmag1]-[sec_nonmag3 ] ) .",
    "in case of r - modes it is stationary differential rotation , stratified on cylinders . the freedom in a homogeneous part of the solution can be also understood as excitation of r - mode in a differentially rotating star . as far as this background differential rotation is weak (",
    "second order in oscillation amplitude ) it does not affect r - mode .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite , who discuss r - mode oscillation of differentially rotating polytropic stars and obtain r - mode solution in a case , when degree of differential rotation is not too high .",
    "recently , @xcite confirm that r - modes are rather insensitive to small differential rotation within general relativity cowling approximation .",

    "such a solution corresponds to a very specific set of initial conditions and it is not surprising , that it was not obtained in numerical calculations by @xcite .",

    "for example , for ocean waves ( incompressible fluid in external gravity field ) this property was demonstrated by @xcite . in particular , for r - modes this generalization may allow to go beyond restriction of second order solution by @xcite ( @xmath60 and @xmath23 ) .",

    "this differential rotation can be described by arbitrary stationary profile , stratified on cylinders .",
    "if we restrict our consideration to r - modes excited by the gravitational radiation in initially uniformly rotated nss , this profile is well defined ( @xcite ) . however , stationary differential rotation is forbidden for magnetized star ( ferraro isorotation law ) , thus for magnetized ns a general r - mode solution can not be presented as sum of oscillations and free _ stationary _ differential rotation .",
    "magnetic field modifies general r - mode solution and we discuss this modification in the next section .",
    "oscillations in nonmagnetized ns can have nonvanishing drift , leading to large ( and increasing ) lagrangian displacements , but eulerian perturbation of all quantities stays small .",
    "this is not the case for a magnetized ns .",
    "magnetic field is frozen into fluid elements , so that large lagrangian displacements generally lead to large eulerian perturbations of magnetic field . as a result ,",
    "one generally can not expand eulerian perturbation of magnetic field in powers on oscillation amplitude and apply perturbed eulerian approach to describe r - modes with nonvanishing drift .",
    "hence , a stricter formalism is required to describe oscillations with nonvanishing secular drift in magnetized ns . here",
    "we describe such formalism based on the idea to present a general second order r - mode solution as a superposition of two solutions : ( a ) solution which describes evolution of the differential rotation in nonoscillating ns within exact mhd equations ( later referred to as drift solution , because it will describe drift ) , and ( b ) non - drifting oscillating solution for @xmath5 , described in the previous section . to achieve",

    ", we can estimate an upper limit for the enhancement of the magnetic field energy @xmath149 as an energy of initial drift motion @xmath150 . here",
    "for initial drift velocity equal to mass transfer velocity @xmath152 and fiducial ns parameters written above we come to @xmath153  g. thus , if initial field @xmath154  g it will not be enhanced by the drift significantly . ) . ]",
    "if , on the contrary , initial field @xmath155  g , it can be enhanced up to @xmath156  g.    this section s conclusion can be formulated in almost the same form as for nonmagnetized ns : a general second order r - mode solution can be presented as a superposition of oscillating solution with vanishing drift and a solution , which describes differential rotation in nonoscillating ns .",
    "the main effect of magnetic field is that it modifies differential rotation in nonoscillating nss . in case of magnetized star differential rotation",
    "can not be stationary , but should evolve on the alfvn timescale .",
    "we reanalyze second order effects in r - mode oscillations . for nonmagnetized ns we refute widely believed statement that ( second order ) drift ( secular motion of fluid elements ) is an essential feature of r - modes .",
    "we present the second order r - mode solution with vanishing drift ( non - drifting solution ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : nonmag ] ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "this solution is applicable in a case of slow rotation ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath23 .",
    "however , we suppose that these restrictions are not crucial for the main results of paper ( see footnote [ footnote_gen ] ) , but we leave a strict proof of this conjecture beyond the scope of the paper . in sec .  [",
    "sec : mag ] we demonstrate that this non - drifting solution is valid for magnetized ns . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath5 r - mode solutions with nonvanishing drift can not be applied directly to magnetized ns because magnetic field leads to evolution of the mass transfer velocity , which describes drift , on the alfvn timescale .",
    "however this evolution is decoupled from oscillations .",
    "this means that the general r - mode solution can be presented as superposition of two solutions : ( a ) the solution characterizing evolution of mass transfer velocity ( drift motion ) , which is the same as evolution of differential rotation in _ nonoscillating _ ns ( initial conditions correspond to the mass transfer velocity at @xmath157 ) ; and ( b ) non - drifting r - mode solution . secular evolution of magnetic field is entirely determined by drift motion , thus its initial energy gives an upper limit for the enhancement of magnetic field energy .",
    "the total energy of the r - mode can not be converted into magnetic energy because it exceeds drift energy for a factor of @xmath158 .",
    "thus we conclude that magnetic field energy enhancement does not prove to be relevant for oscillation energy decrease and therefore can not prevent instability .",
    "still , in our consideration we neglect gravitational radiation - reaction force .",
    "as shown by @xcite ( published in arxiv , while the present manuscript has been under revision ) , this force excites r - mode with well defined nonvanishing mass transfer velocity ( differential rotation ) in nonmagnetized nss . strictly speaking , in the present paper we demonstrate that this mode does not dump regardless of magnetic field enhancement ( the opposite to what follows from results by @xcite , in case when gravitational radiation force stop acting . in reality ,",
    "gravitational radiation force acts permanently and accurate description of second order r - modes under combined action of gravitational radiation and magnetic field is particularly interesting task .",
    "we expect that two limiting cases are possible , depending on the ratio of alfvn timescale @xmath159 to r - mode growing time @xmath160 .",
    "if @xmath161 , then magnetic field has enough time to affect mass transfer rate and the theory described here remains applicable . in the opposite case ,",
    "namely when @xmath162 , r - modes will saturate rapidly , since they are almost unaffected by the magnetic field .",
    "saturated r - modes require special consideration .",
    "it is typically assumed that saturation of r - mode instability is associated with the lowest parametric instability threshold in nonlineary coupled triplets of oscillation modes [ @xcite ] . within this model ,",
    "saturated r - mode is always accompanied by excited daughter modes ( at least two ) .",
    "if amplitudes of these latter modes are comparable with r - mode amplitude , the first order velocity field should be presented as a sum of three oscillation modes , and each of them affects second order equations .",
    "then the total mass transfer velocity , in principle , can differ from eq .",
    "( [ vd_sa ] ) , so that the very existence of nondrifting solution might be challenged as well as applicability of the theory discussed here . however , if saturation amplitude is not too large ( @xmath79 ) , we expect that such scenario does not occur and we can obtain nondrifting solution even for arbitrary number of eigenmodes excited in first order .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of this question is left beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "strictly speaking , the present results are accurate only at second order in mode amplitude .",
    "however , the drift of the fluid elements in the next orders ( the third and higher ) can not be excluded . even if mass transfer velocity for such drift is very small @xmath163  cms@xmath124 , it can lead to large lagrangian displacements on a timescale of years ( in nonmagnetic case ) .",
    "the second order drift and first order oscillations are coupled in the third order . as a result",
    "the theory in third order can be much more complicated than the one in second order described here .",
    "furthermore , for very large amplitudes @xmath164 , which can be studied only numerically , r - modes decay nonlinearly and strong differential rotation develops ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a strong differential rotation ( angular velocities in the range @xmath165 of the initial one according to @xcite ) can strongly affect magnetic field ( formally , it does not contradict with our estimates , which predict enhancement of the magnetic field up to @xmath166  g for @xmath167 ) . however , r - mode saturation amplitudes calculated by @xcite are small @xmath79",
    ". thus it seems reasonable to restrict consideration to small amplitudes . in this case",
    ", the total mass transfer velocity has small value of the second order in @xmath4 , even if we include high order terms . as a result , a general argument by @xcite ( see footnote [ footnote_af63 ] ) , that too slow differential rotation can not generate magnetic field , is still valid within high order perturbation theory .",
    "consequently , high order corrections can hardly result in strong magnetic field generation .",
    "however , we leave a more accurate analysis of high order effects outside the paper .    to conclude we note , that results discussed here can be easily generalized for any oscillating mode in any magnetized medium , if secular drift is a perturbation , allowed by the linear perturbation theory .",
    "this property seems to be rather general , at least it holds true for r - modes and ocean waves ( @xcite ) and we plan to study whether it is indeed a general property of second order oscillations or not .",
