    "is whether and how such a phenomenon can be explained with the aid of a known theoretical model .",
    "this question is addressed in the present paper .",
    "we consider two simple random graph models admitting a power - law degree distribution and positive clustering coefficient .    given a finite set @xmath2 and a collection of its subsets @xmath3 , the active intersection graph defines adjacency relation between the subsets by declaring two subsets adjacent whenever they share at least @xmath4 common elements .",

    "a pair of elements is declared an edge if it is contained in @xmath4 or more subsets . here",
    "@xmath5 is a model parameter .",
    "both models have reasonable interpretations : in the active graph , two actors @xmath6 and @xmath7 establish a communication link whenever they have sufficiently many common interests ; in the passive graph , students become acquaintances if they participate in sufficiently many joint projects . in order to model active and passive graphs with desired statistical properties , we choose subsets @xmath3 at random and",
    "obtain random intersection graphs .",
    "such random graph models have been introduced in @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the adjacency relations of random intersection graphs resemble that of some real networks , like , for example , the actor network , where two actors are linked by an edge whenever they have acted in the same film , or the collaboration network , where authors are declared adjacent whenever they have coauthored at least @xmath4 papers .",
    "these networks exploit the underlying bipartite graph structure : actors are linked to films , and authors to papers .",
    "newman et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the clustering property of some social networks could be explained by the presence of such a bipartite graph structure ; see also @xcite , and references therein . in this respect , it is relevant to mention that the random intersection graphs of the present paper can be obtained from the random bipartite graph with bipartition @xmath8 , where each vertex @xmath9 of the set @xmath10 selects the set @xmath11 of its neighbors in the bipartite graph independently at random .",
    "in addition , we assume for simplicity that all elements of @xmath2 have equal probabilities to be selected . now , the active intersection graph defines the adjacency relation on the vertex set @xmath12 : @xmath9 and @xmath13 are adjacent if they have at least @xmath4 common neighbors in the bipartite graph .",
    "similarly , vertices @xmath14 are adjacent in the passive graph whenever they have at least @xmath4 common neighbors in the bipartite graph .",
    "an attractive property of these models that motivated",
    "our study is that they capture some features of real networks and , therefore , they may be useful in better understanding the statistical properties of some social networks .",
    "to summarize our paper , we note that both active and passive random intersection graphs admit a nonvanishing clustering coefficient although their `` clustering mechanisms '' are different .",
    "both models admit a power - law ( asymptotic ) degree distribution but of a different structure .",
    "a common feature of these models is that the ( asymptotic ) degree distribution of graphs with a nontrivial clustering coefficient ( i.e. , one taking values other than @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) has a finite second moment . another",
    "interesting fact is that , in many cases , the chance of two neighbors of a given vertex to be adjacent decays as @xmath17 , where @xmath1 is the vertex degree .",

    "this theoretical result agrees with the empirical findings reported in  @xcite showing the @xmath0 scaling in some real networks .",
