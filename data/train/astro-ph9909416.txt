    ". this presumably levitates matter out to a distance from the star where gas temperature and gas density are favourable for the formation of dust . once dust forms in sufficient abundance , radiation pressure on the dust grains and collisional coupling of the grains with the gas drives an efficient stellar wind ( wickramasinghe et al .  1966 ; goldreich & scoville 1976 ) .",
    "in this way , agb stars and rsgs lose a significant fraction of their initial mass at rates of up to @xmath11 to @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , and they become surrounded by a dusty circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "the stellar light is almost entirely absorbed by the dust at wavelengths @xmath12 m , but re - emission by the dust at @xmath13 m makes the cses very bright infrared ( ir ) objects .",

    "follow - up observations have been primarily done to obtain accurate bolometric luminosities for these stars , which is possible because the distance to the lmc is known with relatively high accuracy , and also , in the case of agb stars , to determine whether the circumstellar dust and/or the photospheric composition is dominated by an oxygenous or carbonaceous chemistry ( van loon et al .",

    "the paper is organised as follows : section 2 describes the input to the model .",
    "a number of assumptions have been made for various reasons , either because it is a valid approximation , the parameter is not known , or simply for the sake of restricting the parameter space .",
    "the aim has been to maximise homogeneity in modelling our large dataset .",
    "section 3 presents the observed seds and their best model fits for all stars in our sample . in section 4",
    "the resulting bolometric luminosities and mass - loss rates are discussed in detail .",

    "these are discussed below , after a brief description of the observed seds .",
    "the model is fitted to photometric and spectroscopic data in the ir .",
    "these data consist of iso measurements , supplemented by near - ir photometry gathered at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) within the framework of a monitoring campaign to obtain pulsation periods for the stars in the iso sample ( whitelock et al .  1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "the variability information resulting from the monitoring project will be used for correlation with the results from the model fits .",
    "the iso data comprise broadband photometry at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath14 m using the isocam and isophot instruments , and spectroscopy between 2.5 and 12 @xmath14 m using isophot and between 7 and 14 @xmath14 m using isocam .",

    "interstellar extinction will be ignored , because the sed will only be studied at wavelengths beyond 1 @xmath14 m where interstellar extinction is expected to be insignificant compared to the extinction by the cse . however , there are indications that along some lines of sight through the lmc this may not be true ( paper iii ) .",
    "furthermore , the distance to the stars is assumed to be 50 kpc .",
    "although there is reason to believe that the distance to the lmc may be somewhat larger than this ( feast 1998 ) , most distance estimates cluster around a value of 50 kpc ( walker 1999 ) .",

    "this is a rather arbitrary choice , but corresponds roughly to the typical extensions of cses .",
    "an order of magnitude difference in this ratio does not significantly affect the calculated sed .",
    "the inner boundary is set by requiring the temperature at the inner radius , @xmath23 , of the dusty cse to be @xmath24 k. this corresponds to the typical temperature at which dust condenses , although it should be realised that this depends on the chemistry .",

    "this can not be confirmed with the current dataset , but the quality of the 60 @xmath14 m data is not high enough to rule it out either ; ( iii ) a shallower slope of the sed at far - ir wavelengths may be obtained by increasing the complex term of the optical constants , thereby increasing the emission in the far - ir over the extinction at shorter wavelengths .    often the silicate feature produced by the model using amorphous olivine is too strong compared to that observed , i.e.  for hv996 and iras05402@xmath466956 .",

    "the observed silicate emission sometimes peaks at a longer wavelength than does the model , which may be caused by our assumption of spherical grain shape : a continuous distribution of ellipsoids would yield somewhat broader emission features at a wavelength that can be a few 0.1 @xmath14 m longer .",
    "perhaps the silicate dust in the lmc is different from silicate dust that is formed at solar metallicity .    a third discrepancy seen for some , but not all ,",

    "m - type stars obey approximately the same relation between @xmath67 and @xmath66 as carbon stars do , although the scatter in the m - type stars seems larger and they appear to have @xmath67 smaller by @xmath74 mag for @xmath75 mag .",

    "only stars with @xmath76 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 are plotted , together with the optically bright carbon stars in the lmc from costa & frogel ( 1996 ) .",
    "optically bright carbon stars , dust - enshrouded carbon stars , and dust - enshrouded m - type agb stars and rsgs occupy distinct luminosity ranges with little overlap : optically bright carbon stars populate the agb mostly between @xmath77 and @xmath78 mag , whilst most dust - enshrouded carbon stars have luminosities between @xmath79 and @xmath80 mag .",

    "the fact that the dust - enshrouded carbon stars are more luminous than the optically bright carbon stars suggests that ( i ) mass - loss rates increase during the thermal - pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) rendering carbon stars optically invisible before they leave the agb and/or ( ii ) carbon stars with more massive cores spend a larger fraction of their tp - agb lifetime being obscured by a massive cse than carbon stars with less massive cores .",
    "if ( i ) is true then dust - enshrouded carbon stars are closer to the tip of the agb than are their optically visible counterparts , in which case their luminosity distribution ( fig .",
    "8) will be representative of the progenitors of planetary nebulae .",
    "this is also valid for the m - type agb stars that do not seem to evolve much in luminosity once they have become dust - enshrouded : if their luminosities would still increase by more than a factor of two then many more dust - enshrouded m - type agb stars would be expected with @xmath84 mag .    among the dust - enshrouded agb stars , the luminosity distribution of m - type stars peaks at @xmath85 mag which is significantly more luminous than the peak of the carbon star luminosity distribution at @xmath86 mag . if , as suggested above , luminosities of dust - enshrouded agb stars can be directly translated into progenitor masses then the division of @xmath87 mag between the dust - enshrouded m - type and carbon star luminosity distributions translates to a zero age main sequence ( zams ) mass of @xmath88 m@xmath3 ( wood 1998 ) .",
    "stars with @xmath89 become carbon stars on the tp - agb .",
    "our sample of dust - enshrouded carbon stars contains stars as faint as @xmath90 mag , implying a lower limit to the progenitor mass of carbon stars between 1 and 2 m@xmath3 ( wood 1998 ) .",
    "this lower mass limit should be regarded as tentative , because the way our sample was selected will result in faint dust - enshrouded stars being under - represented .",
    "it is in good agreement , though , with the 1.5 m@xmath3 lower limit to carbon star formation as estimated by groenewegen & de jong ( 1993 ) .",
    "stars with @xmath91 stay oxygen rich on the tp - agb .",
    "this is expected if hot bottom burning ( hbb : iben 1981 ; iben & renzini 1983 ; wood et al .",
    "1983 ) is effective : in sufficiently massive stars the pressure and temperature at the bottom of the convective mantle are high enough for carbon to be processed into ( mainly ) nitrogen , thus preventing the formation of a carbon star .",
    "the fact that dust - enshrouded carbon stars more luminous than @xmath92 mag are not entirely absent in the lmc means that hbb can not be effective during the entire duration of the tp - agb .",
    "hbb may shut off near the very end of the tp - agb when mass loss has reduced the mass of the mantle to below a critical value needed to maintain the high pressure and temperature required for hbb to occur ( boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ) .",
    "dredge - up of carbon by another thermal pulse may then cause the photospheric carbon - to - oxygen ratio to exceed unity ( frost et al .",
    "1998 ; marigo et al .",
    "1998 ) . with 3 out of 13 dust - enshrouded agb stars between @xmath92 and @xmath82 mag being carbon stars",
    ", this means that massive agb stars ( typically @xmath93 m@xmath3 ) experience about four to five thermal pulses during the dust - enshrouded phase .",
    "agb stars with @xmath93 m@xmath3 have interpulse periods of @xmath94 yr ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) , yielding lifetimes for these dust - enshrouded agb stars of @xmath95 yr .      in fig .",
    "9 the mass - loss rates are plotted versus the bolometric magnitudes for the stars in our sample . before discussing the implications for the mass loss in the agb and rsg phases ,",
    "two possible selection effects need to be addressed .",
    "first , faint stars with high mass - loss rates may have escaped selection due to the difficulty to detect their faint , obscured near - ir counterpart .",
    "indeed , the two carbon stars iras05289@xmath466617 with @xmath96 mag and @xmath97 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and iras05568@xmath466753 with @xmath98 mag and @xmath99 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 were only included because in both cases the iras point source had been erroneously identified with an m - type field star .",
    "the k - band magnitude of their real near - ir counterparts is expected to be fainter than @xmath100 mag , which is beyond any of the near - ir searches done so far .",
    "hence more such heavily obscured , bolometrically faint stars are expected to exist ( see also paper iii and loup et al .",
    "1999 ) . from the luminosity distributions ( fig .",
    "8) these are expected to be carbon stars . a similarly obscured object ( s13 )",
    "was found in the small magellanic cloud by groenewegen & blommaert ( 1998 ) .",
    "second , stars with small ir excesses have been largely excluded from our sample .",
    "this may have resulted in the absence of stars with @xmath101 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 around @xmath102 mag to stars with @xmath103 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 around @xmath104 mag .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether this region in the @xmath28 versus @xmath64 diagram is in fact devoid of stars .",
    "gail & sedlmayr ( 1987 ) suggested that dynamical considerations exclude dust - driven winds with @xmath105 few @xmath106 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( at @xmath107 few @xmath108 l@xmath3 ) , which is reproduced in recent model calculations by schrder et al .  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the values for @xmath28 that we find for faint stars of @xmath107 few @xmath108 l@xmath3 are more than an order of magnitude lower than the lower limit predicted by gail & sedlmayr ( 1987 ) .",
    "these stars provide direct evidence for the existence of a wind - driving mechanism other than purely radiation pressure on dust .    on average mass - loss rates appear to be higher for the m - type stars than for the carbon stars in our sample , but this is a result of the higher luminosities of the m - type stars in our sample rather than the different chemistry per se ( fig .",
    "the data suggest a maximum limit to the mass - loss rate , outlined by a ( short - dashed ) line of @xmath109 . there does not seem to be a distinction between the luminosity dependence of the maximum @xmath28 for agb stars  be it carbon or m - type  and rsgs , despite their different masses and internal structure .",
    "the maximum @xmath28 is higher than the classical single - scattering limit @xmath110 ( jura 1984 ) by a factor @xmath111 at @xmath112 l@xmath3 up to a factor @xmath61 at @xmath113 l@xmath3 .",
    "this is expected to happen when multiple scattering of photons in the dusty cse becomes important ( gail & sedlmayr 1986 ) .",
    "the six m - type stars closest to the @xmath28 limit are indeed also the stars with the largest optical depth at 1 @xmath14 m among the m - type stars , averaging @xmath38(1 @xmath14m)@xmath114 .",
    "the same is true for the two carbon stars near the @xmath28 limit , iras05289@xmath466617 and iras05568@xmath466753 , that have the largest optical depth among the carbon stars , with @xmath38(1 @xmath14m)@xmath115 and 56 , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath116 can be identified with the flux - weighted optical depth @xmath117 ( cf .",

    "the reason for the discrepancy between the galactic carbon stars and the carbon stars in the lmc , and between the work of groenewegen et al .  and ivezi & elitzur is likely to be related to the different optical properties assumed for the dust by the various authors .    to appreciate the importance of the mass - loss rate for the evolution of a star ,",
    "@xmath28 should be compared with the rate at which mass is consumed by nuclear burning , @xmath6 , and which determines the evolutionary timescale in the absence of severe mass loss . in agb stars",
    "the energy is mainly produced by the cno cycle in the h - burning shell , releasing @xmath126 erg g@xmath4 , whilst in rsgs the 3@xmath127 cycle in the he - burning core is responsible for the stellar luminosity , releasing @xmath128 erg g@xmath4 ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",
    "the lines of @xmath6 are proportional to @xmath33 ( dotted in fig .",
    "all agb stars in our sample with measurable mid - ir emission from circumstellar dust have @xmath129 , and hence their agb evolution will be terminated by the loss of the stellar mantle before the core can grow significantly .",
    "indeed , the extreme agb stars with @xmath124 have lifetimes of only of the order of @xmath22 yr , which is comparable to the interpulse timescale ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .",
    "most rsgs ( @xmath130 mag ) , however , experience @xmath131 .",
    "this means that they can not lose a large fraction of their stellar mantles before presumably ending as supernovae .",
    "woh g64 with @xmath132 mag and @xmath133 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and probably also iras04530@xmath466916 with @xmath134 mag and @xmath135 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 may be the only rsgs in our sample that have @xmath136 . at such high mass - loss rates these two stars have lifetimes of only @xmath137 yr .    the empty area in the ( @xmath64,@xmath28 ) diagram between the two rsgs woh g64 and iras04530@xmath466916 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively , and",
    "the six rsgs with about two orders of magnitude lower mass - loss rates is hard to explain in terms of selection effects and may therefore be a real gap in the @xmath28 distribution of rsgs . from these numbers we estimate that rsgs",
    "spend about 25% of their rsg lifetime in the intense mass - loss phase at @xmath140 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and 75% in a moderate mass - loss phase at @xmath141 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 . a similar gap of about an order of magnitude in @xmath28 may be present in the @xmath28 distribution of agb stars , although for stars fainter than @xmath142 mag this is hard to prove due to the selection effects mentioned before .",
    "if true , however , this means for the agb stars that most ( @xmath143% ) of the time on the tp - agb is spent in relative quiescence , at high but not extraordinarily high @xmath28 , with only short phases of intense mass loss ( see also vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .",
    "such a `` burst '' may be episodic , or it may be the final shedding of the stellar mantle before the star leaves the agb . according to recent evolutionary calculations by schrder et al.(1998 , 1999 ) , which take into account the characteristics of dust - induced mass - loss from pulsating agb stars ,",
    "the duration of the high mass - loss phases strongly depends on the initial stellar mass .    the two brightest carbon stars in the sample , iras04496@xmath466958 with @xmath144 and shv0521050@xmath46690415 with @xmath145 mag have mass - loss rates that are significantly lower than the mass - loss rates of most of the oxygen - rich agb stars at these high luminosities .",
    "we speculate that these stars may exhibit lower mass - loss rates following a ( final ) thermal pulse ( schrder et al .  1998 , 1999 ) that converted them from oxygen - rich agb stars into carbon stars after hbb could not be maintained anymore because the stellar mantles had been strongly diminished by mass loss on the tp - agb .",
    "this strengthens the explanation of the silicate dust around iras04496@xmath466958 being due to a final thermal pulse , as suggested by trams et al .",
    "the process of dust formation is extremely sensitive to the temperature ( arndt et al .",
    "1997 ) , and ( episodes of ) increased mass - loss rates may therefore be related to lower @xmath15 of the stars .",
    "the spectral subclasses of the m - type stars in our sample for which the spectral type is known are plotted versus their bolometric magnitudes ( fig .",
    "11 ) , with the size of the symbol increasing with larger @xmath28 .",
    "the strong luminosity dependence of @xmath28 is very prominent .",
    "however , there also seems to be a temperature dependence of @xmath28 : cooler stars , i.e.  stars with larger subclasses , experience larger @xmath28 than warmer stars . because the luminosity , effective temperature and surface gravity are inter - related ( via the stellar radius )",
    "it is not yet clear to what extent the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath33 and @xmath15 reflects a dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath146 .",
    "we derived mass - loss rates and luminosities for a sample of dust - enshrouded oxygen- and carbon - rich agb stars as well as a few optically bright agb stars and red supergiants , all of which have been observed with iso , using a radiation transfer code to model the spectral energy distributions at ir wavelengths .    the luminosity distribution of dust - enshrouded carbon stars peaks at @xmath86 mag , which is in between the peak of the luminosity distribution of optically bright carbon stars ( @xmath147 mag ) and the peak of the luminosity distribution of dust - enshrouded m - type agb stars ( @xmath148 mag ) .",
    "we interpret this as follows : stars with masses of @xmath111 to 4 m@xmath3 become dust - enshrouded carbon stars on the thermal pulsing agb , whereas more massive agb stars remain oxygen - rich as a result of hot bottom burning .",
    "optically bright carbon stars may still evolve in luminosity before becoming dust - enshrouded , or they may be associated with generally less massive stars ( 1 to 2 m@xmath3 ) than the stars that become dust - enshrouded carbon stars .",
    "the existence of a few luminous carbon stars may be explained by hbb switching off near the very tip of the agb and the occurrence of a final thermal pulse thereafter .",
    "mass - loss rates of both agb stars and rsgs are found to increase with increasing luminosity and decreasing effective temperature , and are typically @xmath149 to @xmath150 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 on the tp - agb and @xmath141 to @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 for rsgs .",
    "mass - loss rates in some cases exceed the limit set by the rate at which the available photon momentum can be transferred onto the gas and dust by means of single scattering , providing evidence for multiple scattering to be effective in driving the outflow .",
    "such intense mass loss only happens during distinct ( possibly recurrent ) phases in the evolution of agb stars and rsgs that last typically 20 to 25% of the dust - enshrouded lifetime .",
    "it is only during these episodes of intensified mass loss that the mass - loss rate of rsgs exceeds the mass - consumption rate due to nuclear burning , whereas the mass - loss rate of dust - enshrouded agb stars always exceeds the mass - consumption rate due to nuclear burning .",

    "<S> a radiative transfer code is used to model the spectral energy distributions of 57 mass - losing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) for which iso spectroscopic and photometric data are available . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we derive mass - loss rates and bolometric luminosities .    </S>",
    "<S> a gap in the luminosity distribution around @xmath0 mag separates agb stars from rsgs . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity distributions of optically bright carbon stars , dust - enshrouded carbon stars and dust - enshrouded m - type stars have only little overlap , suggesting that the dust - enshrouded agb stars are at the very tip of the agb and will not evolve significantly in luminosity before mass loss ends their agb evolution .    derived mass - loss rates span a range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> more luminous and cooler stars are found to reach higher mass - loss rates . </S>",
    "<S> the highest mass - loss rates exceed the classical limit set by the momentum of the stellar radiation field , @xmath5 , by a factor of a few due to multiple scattering of photons in the circumstellar dust envelope . </S>",
    "<S> mass - loss rates are lower than the mass consumption rate by nuclear burning , @xmath6 , for most of the rsgs . </S>",
    "<S> two rsgs have @xmath7 , however , suggesting that rsgs shed most of their stellar mantles in short phases of intense mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> stars on the thermal pulsing agb may also experience episodes of intensified mass loss , but their quiescent mass - loss rates are usually already higher than @xmath6 . </S>"
