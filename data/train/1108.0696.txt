    "this splitting occurs in the second order in @xmath96 and the spectacular sharpness of the peaks is due to the very fast change in the electron first and second excited - state wave functions when one moves away from the point of degeneracy ( for details , see the appendix ) .",
    "the optical transitions between the electron ground and second excited states are also linearly polarized , but with @xmath89 , so that the polarization of these transitions is normal to the polarization of transitions between the electron ground and first excited states .",

    "polarized light the degree of polarization oscillates as well .",
    "inter - level transitions between the `` pure '' states , characterized by the definite angular momentum values differing by one , are either right - hand or left - hand polarized",
    ". however , one can easily see that transitions involving the states , which are strongly `` mixed '' when the flux is an integer number of @xmath46 , have the same probabilities for both circular polarizations .",
    "thus , the magnetic - field - induced optical chirality of quantum rings oscillates with the flux .",
    "the total probabilities of the inter - level transitions indeed depend on the populations of the states involved . however , the discussed oscillations of the degree of polarization do not depend on temperature .",
    "this effect allows aharonov - bohm rings to be used as room - temperature polarization - sensitive detectors of thz radiation or optical magnetometers .",
    "we have demonstrated that a lateral electric field , which is known to suppress aharonov - bohm oscillations in the ground - state energy spectrum of a quantum ring , results in strong oscillations of other physical characteristics of the system .",
    "namely , the electric - field - induced dipole moment oscillates as a function of the magnetic flux piercing the ring , with pronounced maxima when the flux is equal to an odd number of one - half of the flux quantum .",
    "this effect is caused by lifting the degeneracy of states with different angular momentum by arbitrary small electric fields .",
    "it should be emphasized that the discussed effect is not an artifice of the infinitely - narrow ring model used in our calculations , but it persists in finite - width rings in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the essential feature required for this effect is the degeneracy of the states with the angular momenta differing by one at certain magnetic field values , which is known to take place for finite - width rings as well.@xcite    future observation of the dipole moment magneto - oscillations would require careful tailoring of the ring parameters and experiment conditions .",
    "for example , the size of the quantum ring should not exceed the electron mean free path but should be large enough so that , for experimentally attainable magnetic fields , the flux through the ring is near the flux quantum . the electric field should not be too large to avoid polarizing the ring strongly in the absence of a magnetic field , but it should be large enough to achieve a splitting between the ground and first excited states exceeding @xmath97 .",
    "our estimates show that all of these conditions can be met in existing quantum ring systems .",
    "however , the temperature constraint constitutes the major obstacle for any potential applications outside the low - temperature laboratory .",
    "the temperature restrictions are less essential for another predicted effect ",
    "giant magneto - oscillations of the polarization degree of radiation associated with inter - level transitions in aharonov - bohm rings .",
    "notably , these transitions for the rings satisfying the remaining constraints should occur at thz frequencies .",
    "creating reliable , portable , and tunable sources of thz radiation is one of the most formidable problems of contemporary applied physics .",
    "the unique position of the thz range between the frequencies covered by existing electronic or optical mass - produced devices results in an unprecedented variety of ideas aiming to bridge the so - called thz gap ; for example , the proposed methods of down - conversion of optical excitations range from creating ultra - fast saturable absorbers @xcite and utilizing the magnetic - field - induced energy gap in metallic carbon nanotubes@xcite to recent proposals of exciting thz transitions between exciton - polariton branches in semiconductor microcavities.@xcite arguably , the use of quantum rings for thz generation and detection has its merits , since their electronic properties can be easily tuned by external fields . the following scheme for using aharonov - bohm quantum rings as tuneable thz emitters can be proposed .",
    "the inversion of population in semiconductor quantum rings or type ii quantum dots can be created by optical excitation across the semiconductor gap .",
    "angular momentum and spin conservation rules do not forbid the creation of an electron in the first excited state as long as the total selection rules for the whole system , consisting of an electron - hole pair and a photon causing this transition , are satisfied .",
    "terahertz radiation will be emitted when the electron undergoes a transition from the excited to the ground state of the ring . as was shown in the previous sections ,",
    "both the frequency and polarization properties of this transition can be controlled by external magnetic and electric fields .",
    "other potential applications of the discussed effects are in the burgeoning areas of quantum computing and cryptography .",
    "the discussed mixing of the two states , which are degenerate in the absence of electric field , is completely controlled by the angle between the in - plane field and a fixed axis .",
