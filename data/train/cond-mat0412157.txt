    "the real- or imaginary - time dynamics of systems described by a finite hamiltonian matrix , representing bosonic or fermionic degrees of freedom , admits an exact probabilistic representation in terms of a proper collection of independent poisson processes  @xcite . for a lattice system",
    ", the poisson processes are associated to the links of the lattice and the probabilistic representation leads to an optimal algorithm  @xcite which coincides with the green function quantum monte carlo method in the limit when the latter becomes exact  @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite we have exploited the above probabilistic representation to derive analytical estimations for the matrix elements of the evolution operator in the long - time limit . in this way , approximations for the ground - state energy , as well as for the expectation of a generic operator in the ground state of a lattice system without sign problem , have been obtained as the solution of a simple scalar equation .",
    "the results presented in @xcite were based on the application of a central limit theorem to the rescaled multiplicities of the values assumed by the potential and hopping energies in the configurations dynamically visited by the system ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for details on the corresponding probability density ) .",
    "the approximated scalar equation for the ground - state energy obtained by using the central limit theorem contains only the first two statistical moments of the multiplicities above mentioned and , as anticipated in  @xcite , suggests that it is a second order truncation of an exact cumulant expansion . in this paper , after reviewing in detail the approach developed in @xcite , we perform a large deviation analysis of the relevant probability density and obtain this exact cumulant expansion . in principle , if all the cumulants are known , we provide a scalar equation whose straightforward solution is the exact ground - state energy of the system . in practice , we measure the cumulants by a statistical sampling and only a finite number of them is available .",
    "the corresponding truncated equation provides ground - state energies whose level of approximation depends on the values of the hamiltonian parameters and on the size of the system .",
    "however , the convergence as a function of the number of cumulants is rather fast and , as shown in some example cases , the use of the first few cumulants provides results indistinguishable from those obtained by exact numerical simulations .",
    "the spirit of our approach is different from that of monte carlo simulations . in the latter case ,",
    "the accumulated statistical data provide information on the specific system under investigation and new simulations must be performed each time the value of a single parameter of the model is changed .",
    "on the other hand , our approach is semi - analytical in the sense that we have an exact expression for the ground - state energy , in which some statistical data , namely the cumulants of the multiplicities above mentioned , must be provided as an input .",
    "however , these multiplicities , and so the corresponding cumulants , do not depend on the values of the parameters of the model but only on the structure of the hamiltonian operator ( form of the hopping and interaction terms , size of the system , and so on ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath0 spin - up and @xmath0 spin - down particles with on - site interaction of strength @xmath1 the multiplicities depend on the spectrum of the possible on - site pairs , @xmath2 , not on @xmath1 that represents , therefore , a parameter with respect to which our results are analytical .",
    "the analyticity with respect to the parameters of the hamiltonian allows the determination of the expectation of a generic operator in the ground state of the system via the hellman - feynman theorem and suggests other potential applications that we will discuss at the end .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ representation ]",
    "we briefly review the probabilistic representation of quantum dynamics for generic lattice systems . in this way",
    ", the ground - state energy is obtained as the expectation of a suitable stochastic functional . in section [ outline ]",
    "we summarize our main result , namely an exact formula for the ground - state energy , and provide an outline of its proof . in the four subsections of the core section [ pelt ] , we develop in full detail this proof via the analytical determination , in the limit of an infinitely long time , of the expectation of the stochastic functional providing the ground - state energy . in section [ decomposition ] , we decompose the expectation in a series of canonical averages of weights , which are calculated in section [ evaluateweights ] .",
    "the canonical averages are evaluated via a cumulant expansion theorem in section [ largedeviation ] and are finally resummed in section [ resumming ] , where the exact scalar equation for the ground - state energy is presented . in section [ nresults ]",
    "we discuss the numerical evaluation of the cumulants which appear in our formula for the ground - state energy . in the same section",
    ", we also study some example cases and compare the results from our formula with those from exact numerical calculations .",
    "finally , general features of our approach and future applications are summarized and discussed in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "up to section [ evaluateweights ] , we carry on the development both for hard - core bosons and fermions , whereas successively we limit the method to hard - core bosons postponing the fermion case to a later work .",
    "in this section we review the exact probabilistic representation of the imaginary- or real - time dynamics of a system of bosons or fermions on a lattice , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description .",
    "this representation is at the basis of our approach to study the ground - state properties of the system in a semi - analytical way  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on a simple exclusion dynamics , in which multiple occupancies of the lattice sites are forbidden , _",
    "i.e. _ fermions or hard - core bosons are considered .",
    "let @xmath3 be any finite lattice with cardinality @xmath4 and @xmath5 some total ordering of the lattice sites .",
    "the dynamics of a system of hard - core bosons or fermions on this lattice is effectively described in terms of commuting or anticommuting destruction operators @xmath6 with the property @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the site index and @xmath9 the spin , or an arbitrary internal index .",
    "the system can be represented in terms of fock states , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lattice occupation number of the site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 taking the values 0 or 1 .",
    "the number of fock states is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of particles with spin @xmath14 .",
    "we assume the system to be described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the kinetic and potential operators , respectively .",
    "the potential operator @xmath19 is arbitrary , _",
    "e.g. _ for the hubbard model @xmath20 . for the kinetic operator",
    "we assume the quadratic form @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the case @xmath24 is obtained in the presence of a magnetic field . in principle , our approach can be extended to more general kinetic operators .",
    "the essential feature to be noted is that in the fock representation @xmath19 is diagonal whereas @xmath18 is off - diagonal .    in order to study the ground - state properties of the hamiltonian @xmath25 , it is sufficient to evaluate the long - time behavior of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , the ground - state energy is given by @xmath27 the quantum expectation of a generic operator @xmath28 in the ground state of @xmath25 can be obtained by evaluating the ground - state energy @xmath29 of the modified hamiltonian @xmath30 and using the hellman - feynman identity @xmath31    let @xmath32 be the set of system links with spin @xmath14 , _ i.e. _ the pairs @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",

    "by using saddle - point techniques and a cumulant expansion theorem , we have exploited an exact probabilistic representation of the quantum dynamics in a lattice to evaluate the matrix elements of the evolution operator of a system of hard - core bosons in the limit of long times .",
    "the approach yields a simple scalar equation for the ground - state energy in terms of the asymptotic cumulants @xmath179 of the values of the potentials , @xmath111 , and of the kinetic quantities , @xmath112 , assumed by the system during its long - time evolution .",
    "since the cumulants depend only on the structure of the system hamiltonian , once they are known , this equation provides the ground - state energy and , via the hellman - feynman theorem ( [ hf ] ) , the ground - state expectation of any other operator , analytically as a function of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "in contrast , quantum monte carlo methods require , due to the unavoidable branching or reconfiguration techniques ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) , different simulations for different values of the parameters .",

    ", we briefly envisage some of them .    _",
    "i ) _ the knowledge of the ground - state energy as a function of the hamiltonian parameters , @xmath505 , allows in principle the determination of ground - state quenched - averages , @xmath506 , of crucial interest in the study of disordered systems . here",
    ", @xmath507 is a given probability density of the disorder parameters @xmath508 .",
    "note that when the dimension of the space of the hamiltonian parameters is larger than 1 , the evaluation of the above integral by a quantum monte carlo approach may be a hard , if not unmanageable , numerical task .",
    "_ ii ) _ even though we have specialized the study to the easiest case , namely that of hard - core bosons in the absence of a magnetic field , as evidenced at the beginning of section iii and in section iii a , our approach is general and not limited to hard - core boson systems .",
    "fermions and bosons in a magnetic field may in principle be treated in a similar way , provided that we properly take into account also the multiplicities @xmath118 , see eq .",
    "( [ multiplicity - l ] ) .",
    "this possibility is of great interest since , as well known , fermions and bosons in a magnetic field are both affected by the so called sign ( or phase ) problem , which in practice inhibits the accomplishment of unbiased quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "_ iii ) _ we note that our approach is also analytical in the time parameter , @xmath74 . by properly taking into account the derivatives of the cumulants with respect to the number of jumps , @xmath509 , one can obtain not only the asymptotic behavior of the matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ emt ] ) , but also their behavior at finite times , @xmath74 , both imaginary or real .",
    "the latter possibility constitutes another chance of great interest because in general , due to the presence of oscillating terms , also the real time behavior is affected by a sort of sign problem and the quantum monte carlo simulations are reliable only for short times @xcite . of course",
    ", the complete knowledge of the time behavior would imply that of the excited states .    _",
    "iv ) _ finally , we mention a different possible application of the result ( [ e0beq ] ) .",
    "this equation can be exploited in a monte carlo framework for effectively sampling the ground - state energy ( work in progress ) . essentially , the better efficiency of this monte carlo method , compared with that directly deduced from eq .",
