    "experiments on polarized inclusive deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) , reactions of the type @xmath2 with both polarized lepton and hadron , because of the non - existence of neutrino data , can only , in principle yield information on the sum of quark and antiquark parton densities i.e. information on the polarized densities @xmath3 .",
    "information about the antiquark densities @xmath4 and the separate @xmath5 and @xmath6 strange densities thus has to be extracted from other reactions , notably polarized semi - inclusive lepton - hadron reactions ( sidis ) @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a detected hadron in the final state , or from semi - inclusive hadronic scattering ( sihs ) like @xmath9 , involving polarized protons , and only possible at the rhic collider at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "in contrast to the situation in unpolarized dis , a large portion of the most accurate data on polarized dis lie in a kinematical region where target mass corrections ( tmc ) of order @xmath10 ( whose form is exactly known ) , and dynamical higher twist ( ht ) corrections of order @xmath11 are important @xcite .",
    "we have thus included such terms in our description of the dis data .",
    "however , for the sidis data , we do not know the analogous results at present , so do not include such terms . as it happens almost all the sidis data we utilize",
    "are in kinematic regions where such corrections should not be important .    in this",
    "talk we present the results of our combined nlo qcd analysis of polarized inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data @xcite .",
    "the new compass data are also included in the fit . in the calculations of the semi - inclusive asymmetries @xmath12 , the nlo mrst02 pdfs @xcite and the nlo dss fragmentation functions ( ffs ) @xcite were used for the unpolarized parton densities and the fragmentation functions , respectively .",
    "the new results for the polarized pdfs are compared to both the lss06 pdfs @xcite , obtained from the fit to the inclusive dis data alone , and to those obtained from the first global analysis performed by dssv group @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results of our global nlo qcd fit to the world inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data ( for references to the data sets see our paper @xcite ) .",
    "the data used ( 841 experimental points for dis and 202 experimental points for sidis ) cover the following kinematic regions : @xmath13 for dis and @xmath14 for sidis processes .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature and the uncertainties of the polarized pdfs presented correspond to @xmath15 .",
    "a good description of the data is achieved for both the inclusive ( @xmath16=0.85 ) and semi - inclusive ( @xmath16=0.90 ) processes ( nrp is the number of corresponding experimental points ) .",
    "the total value of @xmath17 is 0.88 .",
    "the quality of the fit to the data is demonstrated in fig . 1 in @xcite .      due to sidis data a flavor decomposition of the polarized sea",
    "is achieved and the light anti - quark polarized densities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are determined without any additional assumptions . while @xmath19 is negative for any @xmath20 in the measured @xmath20 region , @xmath21 is a positive , passes zero around @xmath22 and becomes negative for large @xmath20 .",
    "sign - changing solutions are also found for the polarized strange sea @xmath23 and gluon @xmath24 densities .",
    "the sign - changing behavior for @xmath24 is not surprising since it was already found from the analysis of the inclusive dis data alone @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "on the basis of results from all published analyses of inclusive dis , we consider the sign - changing solution for @xmath23 quite puzzling .",
    "the central values of the sea quark and gluon polarized densities together with their error bands are presented and compared to those of dssv ( dashed curves ) in fig . 1 .",
    "our lss06 pdfs ( dot curves ) @xcite obtained from the nlo qcd analysis of the world inclusive dis data are also presented in fig .",
    "while the light anti - quark polarized densities @xmath18 and @xmath19 can not be , in principle , determined from polarized inclusive dis data , the sum @xmath25 _ is _ well determined and all the nlo qcd analyses yield for this sum a _ negative _ value for any @xmath20 in the measured region ( for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in these analyses",
    ", however , a term like @xmath26 , which would permit a sign - change , was not included in the input parametrization of @xmath27 .",
    "we therefore re - analysed the world polarized inclusive dis data using such a term in the input strange sea quark density @xmath28    our preliminary results confirm the previous ones , namely , that @xmath29 is negative in the measured @xmath30 region .",
    "so , the behaviour of the polarized strange quark density remains controversial .",
    "note that in the presence of sidis data @xmath31 and @xmath6 can , in principle , be separately determined , as was done recently by the compass collaboration , where it was shown @xcite that there is no significant difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the @xmath20-range covered by their inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data .",
    "however , the errors of the extracted values of the difference @xmath34 are rather large to allow us to conclude that the assumption @xmath35 used in our s and the dssv analyses is correct .",
    "so , if it is not correct , it might possibly be the cause that @xmath29 densities obtained from the analyses of inclusive dis data and combined inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data sets , respectively , are in contradiction .",
    "however , at first glance , it looks as if the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 would have to be quite significant and might contradict the compass results .",
    "perhaps a more important issue is the sensitivity of the results to the form of the fragmentation functions .",
    "an analysis by the compass group @xcite demonstrated that the determination of @xmath36 strongly depends on the set of the fragmentation functions used in the analysis and that the dss ffs are crucially responsible for the unexpected behavior of @xmath23 obtained from the combined analysis .",
    "[ h ]    in order to understand better the issue of the sign - changing behavior of @xmath23 in the case of the combined fit to the inclusive dis and sidis data a more detailed analysis has been done . in this analysis",
    "the very recent compass data on the asymmetries @xmath37 for charged pions and kaons produced on a proton target @xcite have been included .",
    "first , we have performed a fit to the dis and sidis data including _ only _ the data on the pion @xmath38 asymmetries .",
    "note that in this case only the sum @xmath39 can be determined from the data because of the reasonable assumption @xmath40 used for all the sets of the fragmentation functions .",
    "second , we fitted the inclusive dis and sidis data _ excluding _ the data on the pion @xmath38 asymmetries .",
    "the results on @xmath41 are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 ( left ) and compared to those obtained from dis ( dot curve ) and the combined dis and sidis ( solid curve ) analyses . note that for the fragmentation functions the dss set was used . as seen from fig .",
    "2 ( left ) , in the presence only of the @xmath38 data @xmath41 ( dashed curve ) is still negative in the measured @xmath20 region .",
    "the exclusion of these data from the full set of sidis data leads to a sign - changing behavior of @xmath41 ( dash dot curve ) .",
    "note that in the later case the assumption @xmath35 is used because the accuracy of the present sidis data is not enough to separate the strange quark and anti - quark polarized densities .",
    "one can conclude from this study that the main reason @xmath23 to change a sign are the kaon data and the kaon ffs which are less known and very different for the different sets of fragmentation functions .",
    "so , the study of the sensitivity of @xmath23 to the different kaon ffs used in the analysis is one of the key points we plan to investigate in the future .    in fig .",
    "3 we present our results for the polarized @xmath42 and @xmath43 densities at @xmath44 , which are consistent with those obtained by dssv ( dashed blue curves ) . as expected , the sidis data do not influence essentially the sums @xmath45 and @xmath46 already well determined from the analysis of the inclusive dis data .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 where our results from the combined analysis are compared with our lss06 pdfs .",
    "we have found that the combined nlo qcd analysis of the present polarized inclusive dis and sidis data can not rule out the solution with a positive gluon polarization .",
    "the values of @xmath47 corresponding to the fits with sign - changing @xmath48 and positive @xmath49 are practically the same : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the data can not distinguish between these two solutions ( see fig .",
    "2 ( right ) ) .",
    "the sea quark densities obtained in the fits with positive and sign - changing @xmath52 are almost identical .",
    "note that the extracted ht values corresponding to both fits are also effectively identical . as a result",
    ", one can conclude that including the sidis data in the qcd analysis does not help to constrain better the polarized gluon density .",
    "[ ht ]    in fig .",
    "4 the ratio @xmath53 calculated for both the sign - changing and positive solutions for @xmath24 obtained in our nlo qcd analysis is compared with the directly measured values of @xmath54 obtained from a quasi - real photoproduction of high @xmath55 hadron pairs @xcite , and from the open charm production @xcite measurements . for the unpolarized gluon density @xmath56 in the ratio above",
    "we have used that of the nlo mrst02 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical curves are given for @xmath57 ( high @xmath55 hadron pairs ) and @xmath58 ( open charm ) .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "4 , both solutions for the polarized gluon density are well consistent with the experimental values of @xmath54",
    ". it should be noted , however , that in the extraction of @xmath54 by the experiments a lo qcd treatment has been used .",
    "a nlo extraction of the measured values is needed in order for this comparison to be quite correct . in conclusion ,",
    "the magnitude of the gluon density @xmath52 obtained from our combined nlo qcd analysis of inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data and independently , from the photon - gluon fusion processes , is small in the region @xmath59 .    when our combined analysis was finished , the compass collaboration reported the first data on the asymmetries @xmath37 for charged pions and kaons produced on a proton target @xcite .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "5 , our predictions for these asymmetries are in a very good agreement with the data at measured @xmath20 and @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast to other combined analyses of the inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data , we take into account the target mass and higher twist corrections in a the dis sector .",
    "the values of the ht corrections to @xmath1 extracted from the data in this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "compared to the ht(lss06 ) corrections obtained in our analysis of the inclusive dis data alone @xcite the values of the ht corrections for the proton target are practically not changed , while the central values of ht corrections for the neutron target are smaller in the region @xmath61 , but in agreement with @xmath62(lss06 ) within the errors , excepting the @xmath20 region around @xmath63 we consider the tendency of the @xmath64 corrections to be smaller in the region @xmath61 to be a result of the new behavior of @xmath32 i.e. positive for @xmath65 . the positive contribution in @xmath66 from @xmath32",
    "should be compensated by a less positive @xmath62 contribution in this region . since",
    "the biggest difference between the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 is in the region @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) this effect is biggest in this @xmath20 region .",
    "the impact of @xmath32 on ht corrections is visible mainly for the neutron target because the contribution of @xmath32 in @xmath66 is relatively larger than that in @xmath70 .",
    "[ h ]    note that our results on the ht corrections to the nucleon spin structure function @xmath71 are in a good agreement with the phenomenological study of their first moments @xcite , as well as with the qcd sum rule estimates @xcite , the large @xmath72 limit in qcd @xcite and the instanton model @xcite predictions .",
    "let us finally discuss the present status of the proton spin sum rule . using the values for @xmath73 and @xmath74 at @xmath75 , the first moments of the quark singlet @xmath76 and gluon @xmath77 densities , obtained in our analysis one finds for the spin of the proton : @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ ssr ] ) @xmath79 is the sum of the angular orbital momenta of the quarks and gluons .",
    "although the central values of the quark - gluon contribution in ( [ ssr ] ) are very different in the two cases , in view of the large uncertainty coming mainly from the gluons , one can not yet come to a definite conclusion about the contribution of the orbital angular momentum to the total spin of the proton .",
    "a new combined nlo qcd analysis of the polarized inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data is presented .",
    "in contrast to previous combined analyses , the @xmath0 terms ( kinematic - target mass corrections , and dynamic - higher twist corrections ) to the nucleon spin structure function @xmath1 are taken into account .",
    "the new results for the pdfs are compared to both the lss06 pdfs obtained from a fit to the inclusive dis data alone , and to those obtained from the dssv global analysis .",
    "the role of the semi - inclusive data in determining the polarized sea quarks is discussed . due to sidis data @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as well @xmath82 and @xmath83 are determined without additional assumptions about the light sea quarks .",
    "the sidis data , analysed under the assumption @xmath84 , imposes a sign - changing @xmath85 , as in the dssv analysis , but our values are smaller in magnitude , less negative at @xmath86 and less positive for @xmath87 .",
    "note that @xmath88 differs essentially from the negative @xmath89 obtained from all the qcd analyses of inclusive dis data .",
    "it was also shown that when in the combined qcd analysis only the pion sidis data are included the polarized strange quark density is still negative for any @xmath20 in the measured region , and the change - signing behavior of @xmath90 is due to the kaon asymmetries calculated by the dss fragmentation functions .",
    "a further detailed analysis of the sensitivity of @xmath85 to the kaon ffs is needed , and any model independent constraints on ffs would help .",
    "another possible reason for this disagreement could be the assumption @xmath91 made in the global analyses .",
    "however , this would probably require a significant difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which is not seen in the compass analysis . in any case",
    ", obtaining a final and unequivocal result for @xmath23 remains a challenge for further research on the internal spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "we have found also that the polarized gluon density is still ambiguous , and the present polarized dis and sidis data can not distinguish between the positive and a sign - changing gluon densities @xmath24 .",
    "this ambiguity is the main reason that the quark - gluon contribution into the total spin of the proton is still not well determined .",
    "finally , our combined nlo qcd analysis confirms our previous results on the higher twist corrections to the nucleon spin structure function @xmath92 , namely , that they are not negligible in the pre - asymptotic region and have to be accounted for in order to extract correctly the polarized pdfs .    0.6 cm _ acknowledgments .",
