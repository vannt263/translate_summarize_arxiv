    "<S> in this fluid dynamics video , results from high fidelity numerical simulations are presented , which have been carried out to study the flow and droplet dynamics of liquid sheets formed by two impinging jets . </S>",
    "<S> a three - dimensional volume - of - fluid ( vof ) method with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) based on octree meshes [ 1 ] is used to simulate the various flow patterns associated with impinging jets , secondary breakup and binary collision of droplets . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to amr , a thickness based refinement algorithm is also developed and implemented to efficiently resolve the various scales of surface tension driven interfacial flows .    </S>",
    "<S> oblique collision of two cylindrical , laminar jets causes the liquid to flow outward from the impact point , creating a thin sheet which lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane containing the two jets . </S>",
    "<S> this sheet eventually disintegrates into ligaments and/or droplets . </S>",
    "<S> breakup of the liquid sheet is dominated by viscosity and surface tension effects ( reynolds and weber number ) . in this video , </S>",
    "<S> impinging water jets are investigated , and different flow patterns , such as closed rim , open rim , rimless and ligament , are identified and studied . depending on the operating conditions , </S>",
    "<S> droplets are shed circumferentially from the periphery of the sheet in some cases , whereas in others , ligaments are fragmented from the leading edge of the sheet , which further breaks down into droplets following the rayleigh mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic waves from the point of impingement are clearly seen on the surface of the sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the impact waves cause the early breakdown of the sheet downstream of the impingement point , whereas waves amplified by aerodynamic stresses control the breakdown of the rest of the sheet and the ligaments .    detailed understanding of droplet dynamics , which includes equal and unequal sized droplet collision , bouncing , coalescence , separation , mixing , secondary breakup and mass transfer , </S>",
    "<S> is also obtained systematically at a wide range of operating conditions . </S>",
    "<S> underlying processes governing droplet dynamics are investigated by analyzing the overall energy budget . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an advanced visualization technique using the ray - tracing methodology is implemented to gain direct insight into the detailed physics of droplet interaction . </S>",
    "<S> theories are also established to predict the droplet behavior after collision , which shows good agreement with existing literature . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed account of the above mentioned phenomena can be found in [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . </S>"
