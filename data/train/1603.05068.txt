    "nonresponse in surveys is a commonly encountered problem that , when ignored , can affect the performance of the statistical estimators for the quantities of interest .",
    "two general adjustment techniques that have been developed to alleviate the effects of nonresponse are _ reweighting _ and _ imputation_. reweighting procedures consist of increasing the initial weights of respondents in order to compensate for nonrespondents and are commonly used to treat unit nonresponse .",
    "imputation procedures consist of filling in the missing values in the data with _ imputed values _ and are commonly used to treat item nonresponse .",
    "when dealing with nonresponse , both reweighting and imputation may rely on a statistical model .",
    "imputation for the variable of interest can be more efficient if it is based on information contained in a number of auxiliary variables , specifically , through a model that estimates a functional link between the latter and the variable of interest .",
    "however , the validity of the model will have a direct effect on the accuracy of the estimated quantities .",
    "it is therefore crucial to be able to build flexible models that can capture a large spectrum of patterns and make only weak assumptions about the true underlying mechanism generating the data . given these constraints , it is not surprising that nonparametric models have been used to handle nonresponse in surveys .",
    "@xcite focused on unit nonresponse and proposed two nonparametric reweighting procedures based on kernel density estimators to estimate response probabilities .",
    "later , @xcite used the nonparametric estimation of  @xcite to handle nonresponse when unit nonresponse and item nonresponse occur together . finally , @xcite and @xcite applied , respectively , kernel regression and local polynomial regression to estimate the response probabilities and derived asymptotic properties of the propensity score adjusted estimator for these approaches .",
    "these techniques are suitable when the number of auxiliary variables is relatively low .",
    "we propose here an imputation method for item nonresponse in surveys when the variable of interest is a noisy observation of a function of many auxiliary variables .",
    "we consider smoothing spline models within an additive regression framework which allows us to handle a large number of auxiliary variables .",
    "this improvement significantly expands the range of nonparametric methods for handling nonresponse .",
    "moreover , the model considered is adaptable to a wide variety of functional patterns thus providing protection against model misspecification .",
    "results of a simulation study confirm the performance of our method and highlight its capacity to adapt to many different situations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ section : framework ] establishes the framework and introduces notation ; section  [ section : motivation ] provides a motivation for the new imputation method ; two nonparametric tools used in the new imputation method are reviewed in section  [ section : nonparametric ] ; section  [ section : method ] presents the new method as well as bootstrap procedures to estimate the variance of the total .",
    "the performance of the new method is compared to that of other imputation methods through a simulation study presented in section  [ section : simulation ] .",
    "we close with concluding remarks and a discussion of future work .",
    "consider a finite population @xmath0 of possibly unknown size @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that the parameter of interest is the population total @xmath2 for some unknown variable of interest @xmath3 .",
    "a sample @xmath4 of size @xmath5 is selected from @xmath6 according to a probabilistic sampling design @xmath7 with the aim of observing @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "consider @xmath10 the first - order inclusion probability of unit @xmath11 and suppose that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 represent the design weight of unit @xmath15 .",
    "in this paper we consider two widely used sampling designs , simple random sampling without replacement ( srswor ) and stratified sampling ( ss ) . under srswor , each sample of ( fixed ) size @xmath5 has the same probability of being selected and @xmath16 for all @xmath15 . under ss",
    ", the population @xmath6 is partitioned into @xmath17 strata @xmath18 of respective sizes @xmath19 and srswor is applied independently in each stratum @xmath20 .",
    "a sample @xmath21 of size @xmath22 is hence selected in each stratum @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "once a sample @xmath4 is selected , each unit @xmath9 is classified as either respondent or nonrespondent , depending on whether @xmath8 is observed or missing .",
    "consider the response indicator vector @xmath27 where @xmath28 takes value 1 if @xmath8 is observed and 0 if it is missing .",
    "this results in the set of respondents @xmath29 and in the set of nonrespondents @xmath30 .    under complete response ,",
    "the horvitz - thompson estimator @xmath31 is a design unbiased estimator for @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 . in the case of a survey with nonresponse , however , the estimator   can not be computed since some of the @xmath8 s , @xmath9 are missing .",
    "one remedy is to impute each missing value @xmath8 , @xmath34 with an imputed value @xmath35 .",
    "the population total @xmath32 can then be estimated through the _ imputed estimator _ @xmath36      = \\sum_{i \\in s_r } \\frac{1}{\\pi_i } y_i + \\sum_{i \\in s_m } \\frac{1}{\\pi_i } y_i^ * = \\sum_{i \\in s } \\frac{1}{\\pi_i } \\widetilde{y}_i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 if the imputation process exactly reconstructs the missing values , that is if @xmath38 for @xmath34 , then @xmath39 is a design unbiased estimator for the population total @xmath32 .",
    "hence , an imputation method that reconstructs the missing data well can provide protection against nonresponse bias .",
    "design weights can optionally be taken into account when constructing the imputed values , the resulting method being referred to as _",
    "survey weighted imputation_.    consider a vector @xmath40 of values taken by @xmath41 auxiliary variables @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and known for all @xmath15 or at least for all @xmath9 .",
    "auxiliary information can be used at different stages of the survey , namely in establishing the sampling design , for estimation , and handling of nonresponse .",
    "reliable auxiliary information can explain the variation in the variable of interest and/or in the response probabilities and helps reduce error due to sampling and nonresponse .",
    "we consider a variable of interest , @xmath3 , that is measured along with @xmath41 auxiliary variables , @xmath46 . in situations in which the variable of interest is not recorded for some sampled units , one may rely on the auxiliary variables to impute the missing values if there is a way to connect these variables via an _ imputation model _  @xcite .",
    "for instance , consider a general model of the type @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are zero - mean independent errors with variance @xmath52 .",
    "a deterministic imputation method estimates first the function @xmath48 based on those individuals / items @xmath53 for which @xmath54 are fully observed , and then imputes values for @xmath34 using the estimated function and the observed @xmath55 .",
    "the challenging issue of estimating @xmath48 naturally arises because the choice of the imputation model crucially impacts the accuracy of the imputed values .",
    "a misspecified model may result in highly biased estimates for the parameters of interest .    without prior knowledge on the form of @xmath48 in ,",
    "it is natural to use a nonparametric regression model since the resulting estimate @xmath56 is known to adapt to the shape of @xmath48 based on the information provided by the data . when handling survey data , however , several auxiliary variables are often available and one needs to include most of them in the model .",
    "unfortunately , a few nonparametric smoothers such as kernel - based ones tend to break down in high dimension , unless the sample size is very large .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the _ curse of dimensionality _ @xcite and can be alleviated if an additive model ( am , * ? ? ? * ) is used .",
    "such a model is additive in the predictor variables and takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath54 , @xmath58 , are observations , @xmath59 is a constant , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , are univariate smooth functions , and @xmath51 are zero - mean independent errors with common variance @xmath52 .",
    "the functions @xmath60 , @xmath61 , are each individually estimated by univariate smoothers so the curse of dimensionality is avoided because the original problem of nonparametric estimation in @xmath62 has been replaced by @xmath41 estimation problems in @xmath50 . without loss of generality , henceforth we suppose that the @xmath55 , @xmath63 , lie in the interval @xmath64^{q}$ ] .",
    "we propose an imputation method for nonresponse in survey based on am .",
    "the new method is based on imputation model .",
    "the nonparametric tools used to estimate the regression function are presented in section  [ section : nonparametric ] and the new method is presented in section  [ section : method ] .",
    "this section introduces two nonparametric tools used in the new imputation method , smoothing spline regression and additive models .",
    "the main idea of smoothing spline regression is to fit a data set with a curve that maximizes a measure of goodness - of - fit while achieving a fixed degree of smoothness .",
    "there is an extensive literature devoted to spline regression and we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . smoothing spline regression ( ssr ) assumes model with a unique predictor variable , that is @xmath65 where @xmath51 are zero - mean independent errors with common variance @xmath52 , and @xmath66 is a smooth function in the sense that @xmath67 $ ] where @xmath68 $ ] is the sobolev space @xmath69 = \\left\\ { g : g , g',\\ldots , g^{(m-1 ) } \\mbox { are absolutely continuous , } \\int_{0}^1 g^{(m)}(t)^2 < + \\infty   \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider a basis of functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , called _ spline basis functions _ , for @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the ssr yields the best approximation of function @xmath66 in @xmath68 $ ] while controlling the degree of smoothness .",
    "the resulting _ smoothing spline estimator _",
    "@xmath72 is the minimizer of the following penalized least square ( pls ) criterion @xmath73 over all functions in @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 is the _ smoothing parameter _ and its size decides the balance between goodness - of - fit , as measured by the mean squared residual , and smoothness , as measured by the integral .",
    "there exist different basis of functions , each of which can produce a different smoothing spline estimator . in",
    "what follows , we will consider the thin plate spline basis  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the smoothing parameter @xmath74 will be selected by generalized cross validation .    with survey data ,",
    "it is often desirable to consider design weights when estimating parameters of interest .",
    "indeed , a design weight @xmath75 can be interpreted as the number of population units that sampled unit @xmath11 represents .",
    "hence , when units are selected with unequal inclusion probabilities it might be unreasonable to assume that each sampled unit has the same influence on the parameters of interest .",
    "a weighted version of the smoothing spline estimator was proposed by  @xcite who suggested adding design weights in the general pls criterion in equation  .",
    "hence , they consider the smoothing spline estimator adapted for survey data which is the minimizer over @xmath76 of @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the estimated population size .",
    "note that @xcite restrict themselves to the case @xmath79 .",
    "a flexible way to combine the contributions of each auxiliary variable to the variable of interest is provided by the additive model paradigm .",
    "a class of generalized additive models was proposed by @xcite and was discussed in depth in the book  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the additive regression model ( am ) , which assumes @xmath80 where @xmath59 is a constant , @xmath60 , @xmath81 , are smooth functions , and @xmath51 are zero - mean independent errors with common variance @xmath52 .",
    "ssr is used to estimate each function @xmath60 , @xmath81 .",
    "a backfitting algorithm @xcite or a direct fitting approach @xcite can be considered .",
    "when appropriate , an additive model allows us to handle multiple predictor variables in a reasonable computation time and avoids the curse of dimensionality problem as it breaks a high - dimensional nonparametric estimation problem into a number of one - dimensional ones .",
    "in this section , we propose a nonparametric model - based imputation method for nonresponse in surveys and discuss bootstrap procedures to estimate the resulting variance of the total estimator for the population @xmath6 .",
    "assume that the sample @xmath4 contains respondents @xmath82 for which the values of the variable of interest @xmath83 are observed and nonrespondents for which these values @xmath84 are missing . for each unit @xmath9 we have available auxiliary variables values @xmath85 .",
    "we consider the following additive imputation model @xmath86 where @xmath59 is a constant , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , are univariate functions in the functional space defined in section  [ section : nonparametric ] , and @xmath51 are zero - mean independent errors with common variance @xmath52 .",
    "smoothing spline estimates @xmath87 , @xmath88 , of functions @xmath60 , @xmath88 , and an estimate @xmath89 of @xmath59 are obtained using the complete data @xmath90 , @xmath53 .",
    "two different smoothing splines estimators can be obtained based on expression ( unweighted imputation ) or expression   ( survey weighted imputation ) , respectively .",
    "finally , missing values @xmath8 , @xmath34 , are imputed with predictions based on imputation model   as follows @xmath91      a valid method for estimating the variance of the estimator of the population total must account for the extra variability due to imputing the missing values . in turn",
    ", this variability is due to the variance of predicted values @xmath92 produced via the additive model .",
    "since an analytical expression for the asymptotic error of am predictive value is not available , we pursue a bootstrap - based approach .",
    "bootstrap procedures to estimate the variance of parameters of interest are available for different imputation methods and sampling designs . in this section ,",
    "we follow @xcite to devise bootstrap procedures to estimate the variance of the total under am imputation for simple random sampling without replacement ( srswor ) and stratified sampling ( ss ) .",
    "the bootstrap proposed in @xcite is asymptotically valid irrespective of the sampling design , or the imputation method .",

    "first , to quantify the accuracy of imputed values , the monte carlo mean relative prediction error was computed , which is defined as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the nonrespondents set obtained at the @xmath158-th simulation , @xmath159 is the size of @xmath157 , @xmath160 is the imputed value obtained for @xmath161 at the @xmath158-th simulation , and @xmath162 represents the number of simulations .",
    "then , for each imputation method , the performance of the imputed estimator of expression   was studied through three comparison measures , namely    * the monte carlo relative bias ( rb ) defined as @xmath163 where @xmath164",
    ", @xmath165 represents the mean imputed estimator over the @xmath162 simulations @xmath166 and @xmath167 is the imputed estimator @xmath39 obtained at the @xmath158-th simulation , * the monte carlo relative root variance ( or relative standard deviation ) defined as @xmath168 where @xmath169 * the monte carlo relative root mean square error defined as @xmath170    for am imputation , the following measures were computed to test the accuracy of the bootstrap variance estimator :    * the monte carlo variance of the total estimator : @xmath169 * the monte carlo expectation of the bootstrap variance estimator : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the bootstrap variance @xmath149 obtained at the @xmath158-th simulation , * the coverage rate cr : the proportion of times the true total @xmath32 falls into the 95% confidence interval @xmath173      figure  [ fig : srs ] , figure  [ fig : ss ] , and table  [ table : variance ] display the results of setting 1 .",
    "table  [ table : ranks ] reports the average ranks over the populations of each imputation method for each measure of comparison . the absolute value of rb was considered .",
    ".average ranks over five populations of each imputation method for each measure of comparison ( in absolute value ) .",
    "[ table : ranks ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that am imputation outperforms the competing imputation methods in terms of mrpe and in terms of rb .",
    "am imputation and random forest perform equally and slightly better than the other three methods in terms of rrvar . with this data ,",
    "the bootstrap variance yields a coverage rate of 94% that is close to the theoretically stated value of 95% .    as we can see from the results of both settings , am imputation performs the best overall , closely followed by random forest",
    "this is not surprising since random forest is also nonparametric .",
    "two advantage of random forest over our imputation method are : 1 ) it can handle mixed - type data and 2 ) auxiliary variables can have missing values .",
    "two advantages of our method are : 1 ) it is fast and 2 ) it allows us to take design weights into account in the imputation model .",
    "a new imputation method for nonresponse in surveys based on spline smoothing within the additive model paradigm was proposed .",
    "the simulations indicate that the new method is very flexible and can capture a large spectrum of functional dependencies between the variable of interest and the auxiliary variables . since the model requires only weak assumptions , it is less susceptible to model misspecification than other models such as parametric ones .",
    "most importantly , the am formulation makes it possible to consider several auxiliary variables in the imputation process without running into the curse of dimensionality phenomenon . a bootstrap procedure to estimate the variance of the total under srswor and ss was suggested .    through a simulation study ,",
    "the new imputation method was confirmed to perform well in many different situations .",
    "the main conclusions of the simulation study are the following . am imputation performs better than the other imputation methods considered when the functional dependence between the variable of interest and the auxiliary variables is additive or when this dependence can be well approximated by an additive function . when this dependence is not well approximated by an additive function or when",
    "there is no dependence between the variable of interest and the auxiliary variables , am imputation shows a performance similar to that of the other imputation methods considered . in all the cases",
    "studied , the proposed bootstrap - based variance estimates were close to the true monte carlo variance and produced very good coverage rates .",
    "future work include extending the current method to situations in which the samples are dependent and improving the computational speed of the variance via parallel processing .",
    "the authors thank yves till for his constructive suggestions .",
