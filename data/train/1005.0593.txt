    "many studies of tmx s ( tm = transition metal and x = c or n ) are motivated by a curiosity on the properties of tmx s , such as their mixture of covalency , ionicity , and metallicity , and by a suggested importance for heterogeneous catalysis . the attention to tmx s",
    "as potential catalysts started with an observation by levy and boudart that the tmc s show a pt - like behavior in several catalytic reactions.@xcite according to more recent investigations , `` early tmc s and tmn s often demonstrate catalytic advantages over their parent metals in activity , selectivity and resistance to poisoning '' and `` for several reactions , such as hydrogenation reactions , catalytic activities of tmc s and tmn s are approaching or surpassing those of group viii noble metals''.@xcite the tmx surfaces are also technologically important as substrate materials in growth processes , _",
    "e.g. _ , in wear - resistant multilayer coatings on industrial cutting tools @xcite and for growth of carbidic nanostructures.@xcite    for catalytic applications , the stable or ideal surfaces are not necessarily the most suitable ones . often the best site for a reaction",
    "is found on a stepped or in some way non - perfect surface , _",
    "e.g. _ , at kinks or around defects , where less stable faces of the material are exposed .",
    "such sites often host surface states or surface resonances ( sr s ) .",
    "this calls for studies on surfaces that present such surface states or resonances .    in previous studies , the reactivities of the tic(@xmath0 ) and tin(@xmath0 )",
    "surfaces are attributed to the presence of sr s of both ti and c / n character.@xcite calculated trends in atomic adsorption strength are explained with a concerted - coupling model ( ccm ) , in which the atomic frontier orbitals interact with both types of sr s .",
    "more recently , we have indentified a descriptor , defined as the mean energy of the tm - derived sr ( tmsr ) , for atomic and molecular adsorption and for activation - energy barriers.@xcite hence , the existence of several linear relations between the atomic and molecular adsorption energies , `` scaling relation '' , have been shown.@xcite such relations are of importance in the design of novel types of catalysts .",
    "@xcite    this paper is devoted to a deeper and more generalized understanding of the chemisorption on the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces , thus also laying the ground for the above mentioned descriptor .",
    "we extend the work done in our previous study of the atomic adsorption on tic(@xmath0 ) and tin(@xmath0 ) and use density - functional theory ( dft ) to investigate whether the ccm is applicable to other tmc s .",
    "our method consists of a detailed study of the trends in reactivity along periods and groups of the substrate parent metal and of the adsorbate , correlated with a careful mapping and analysis of the underlying details of the changes in surface electronic structure upon adsorption .",
    "the substrates chosen in our study are the tmc s formed with the parent metals sc , ti , v , zr , nb , mo , ta , and w in nacl structure ( see fig .",

    "first , a trend study of the clean tm - terminated tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces is presented in section  [ sec : surface ] . in particular",
    "we address the properties of the surface electronic structures that are relevant for the adsorption mechanisms .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : ads ] the adsorption - energy trends are presented together with the trends in the adorption - induced changes in surface electronic structure .",
    "the different trends in adsorption - energy and electronic - structure changes are analyzed and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , thus connecting our results to the previously proposed ccm .",
    "the paper is concluded by section  [ sec : conclusion ] , which summarizes the main conclusions of our investigation and makes some outlooks to possible ramifications and further investigations .",
    "in this section the computational details and results from our dft calculations on the clean tm - terminated tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces are presented .",
    "first , the stability of the ( @xmath0 ) surfaces is considered by comparing the cleavage energies of these surfaces with the corresponding results for the ( @xmath4 ) surfaces .",
    "then , the relaxed surface structures are presented and compared with existing results .",
    "this is followed by a charge transfer analysis and a detailed analysis of both the energy- and space - resolved surface densities of states ( dos s ) .",
    "particular emphasis is put on the presence and character of sr s on the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces . throughout the presentation ,",
    "analyses of the trends with respect to the tm component of the studied tmc s are made .",
    "the surface calculations presented in this paper are performed within the dft formalism using the plane - wave pseudopotential code dacapo.@xcite the ion - electron interaction is treated with vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite the exchange - correlation energy is included by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the pw91 functional.@xcite we utilize a slab geometry , with slabs of @xmath5 to @xmath6 bilayers ( a bilayer being a unit of one tm layer and one c layer ) , a vacuum region thickness corresponding to @xmath7 bilayers , that is , at least @xmath8   , and periodic boundary conditions . each atomic layer is composed of one atom in a ( @xmath9 ) geometry .",
    "the atoms in the three ( four ) outermost atomic layers on the tm - terminated side of a @xmath5 ( @xmath10 ) bilayer thick slab are allowed to relax until the sum of the remaining forces on all relaxed atoms is less than @xmath11  ev /  , while the remaining atomic layers are fixed at the bulk geometry .",
    "a monkhorst - pack sampling  @xcite of @xmath12 special @xmath13-points and a plane - wave energy cutoff of @xmath14  ev are used . the slab used to model",
    "the ( @xmath0 ) surface is asymmetric , which gives rise to a discontinuity in the electrostatic potential at the cell boundary .",
    "this is corrected for by using the scheme in ref .  .",
    "to characterize the surfaces we utilize several electronic structure tools .",
    "a bader analysis is used to calculate the charge localization around individual atoms.@xcite total and local , that is , atom - projected , dos s for the surface bilayer are obtained by projecting the kohn - sham wave functions onto individual atomic orbitals and plotted as a function of energy ( relative to the fermi level @xmath15 ) . to identify the surface specific properties that arise upon creation of the surface , the surface dos s",
    "are compared to the bulk dos s by studying the differences between the two quantities .",
    "information about the spatial localization of the surface - localized states is provided by analyzing the space - resolved surface dos , that is , the kohn - sham wave functions .",
    "the cleavage energy @xmath16 , that is , the energy needed to create two surfaces upon cleavage of a bulk structure along a specific crystallographic plane , is calculated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total energy of a slab with @xmath19 tmc bilayers that exposes the two surfaces under investigation and @xmath20 is the bulk energy of one tmc bilayer , if @xmath19 is sufficiently large .",
    "thus , the cleavage energy corresponds to the sum of the surface energies of the two surfaces obtained upon cleavage . in the case of calculations on stoichiometric tmc(@xmath0 ) slabs ,",
    "the cleavage energy is equal to the sum of the surface energies of the tm - terminated surface and of the c - terminated surface .    our calculated @xmath16 values for the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces , after relaxation of only the tm - terminated side of the slabs ,",
    "are given in table  [ tab : tmc_surf_relax ] .",
    "along a period @xmath16 shows a maximum for group iv , thus showing the same variations as the ones found for the bulk cohesive energies in our previous study.@xcite down a group , the variations in @xmath16 are small but discernible and do not show any apparent correspondence to the bulk cohesive energies of ref .  .",
    "according to the calculated @xmath16 values , tic(@xmath0 ) is the surface that requires the most energy to create among the considered tmc surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , this surface is routinely grown by chemical - vapor deposition ( cvd ) under high temperatures as wear - resistant coating on industrial cutting tools.@xcite the calculated @xmath16 value for the tic(@xmath0 ) surface agrees well with those of previous dft calculations.@xcite    compared to the tmc(@xmath4 ) surfaces , the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces are found to have a higher @xmath16 value ( see table  [ tab : tmc_surf_relax ] ) and are thus less stable . also , the variations in @xmath16 are larger for tmc(@xmath0 ) than for tmc(@xmath4 ) surfaces .",
    "both these properties can be attributed to the polar nature of the ( @xmath0 ) surface.@xcite      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                in this section we present results for molecular adsorption on the vc(@xmath0 ) surface , which is here chosen as a prototype for molecular adsorption on the tmc(@xmath0 ) surface .",
    "the molecular adsorbates are the nh@xmath21 molecules ( @xmath22 ) , which are a part of our study in ref .  .",
    "the same supercell size and computational parameters as those used for the atomic adsorption are employed for these calculations ( see section  [ sec : surf_comp ] ) .",
    "the molecules are adsorbed with the n atom closest to the surface in the fcc site ( the stable site for n atomic adsorption ) .",
    "the adsorption energy is calculated relative to the energy of an isolated nh@xmath21 molecule as @xmath23 the charge transfer between substrate and absorbed molecule is calculated as the sum of the bader charges on each of the constituent atoms in the molecule .    a summary of the results is given in table  [ tab : nhx_on_vc ] .",
    "as the molecule size @xmath24 increases , the perpendicular distance to the surface increases , while both the adsorption energy @xmath25 and the charge transfer from surface to molecule decrease .",
    "figure  [ fig : vc_deltados_nhx ] shows calculated ldos s ( projected on the molecule atoms ) and @xmath26dos",
    "s ( projected on the substrate atoms ) for n and nh@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) on vc(@xmath0 ) . the energy and structure of the ldos s vary between the different adsorbates . for atomic n",
    ", it consists of one delocalized region in the middle of the uvb . for nh ,",
    "there is a slightly weaker delocalized region of n character in the middle of the uvb , together with a sharp peak of mixed n and h character in the lower part of the uvb . for nh@xmath2 ,",
    "the delocalized region of n character in the middle of the uvb is further weakened and a new sharp peak of mixed n and h character appears below the uvb . for nh@xmath3 , the delocalized region in the middle of the uvb disappears , while the sharp peak below the uvb is stronger and lies at lower energy . for all adsorbates",
    ", there is a quenching of both the tmsr and the csr s .",
    "these sr depletions are largest for n and decrease every time a h atom is added to the molecule . hence",
    ", each addition of a h atom weakens the interaction between the adsorbed molecule and the sr s .",
    "as described above , we find several trends in the calculated adsorption energies : `` m''-shaped variations with respect to atomic adsorbate , linear variations with respect to substrate , qualitatively different types of adsorption on scc and for f adatom , and trends in molecular adsorption strength .    in this section ,",
    "we describe how these trends can be described within our previously proposed concerted - coupling model ( ccm ) for atomic adsorption on tix(@xmath0 ) surfaces.@xcite first , the ccm is described by giving an account of the main results of refs .   and shown to apply also on the here considered tmc s by pointing out the similarities in electronic structure results .",
    "then , the different adsorption - energy trends are explained in terms of the ccm .",
    "finally , the results lay the ground for the single descriptor @xmath27 for the adsorption strength , recently introduced in ref .  .      for tm surfaces ,",
    "the @xmath28-band model yields a successful description of electronic structure and adsorption.@xcite for instance , its key parameter @xmath29 , the mean energy of the substrate @xmath28 band , is a good descriptor for , _",
    "e.g. _ , adsorption.@xcite such a fact facilitates the design of new tm catalysts by computational screening.@xcite    for adsorption on tmc s , however , there are deviations from the _",
    "d_-band model.@xcite indeed , we find that different tmc surfaces can have the same value of @xmath29 but different @xmath25 values .",
    "for example , the @xmath29 values for tic(@xmath4 ) and tic(@xmath0 ) surfaces are as close as @xmath30  ev and @xmath31  ev , whereas the @xmath25 values for oxygen differ considerably , being @xmath32  ev and @xmath33  ev , respectively.@xcite    in the _",
    "d_-band model , adsorption trends are explained by the interaction between the adatom frontier orbital and the narrow tm @xmath28 band . using the terminology of the newns - anderson ( na ) model for chemisorption ,",
    "@xcite this bond is typically `` strong '' and results in the formation of separated bonding and antibonding adatom  substrate states ( see case d in fig .  [",
    "fig : na]).@xcite        in refs .  , and , atomic adsorption on the tic and tin ( @xmath0 ) surfaces is described as a result of two types of interactions between adsorbate and substrate . in the terminology of the na model , the coupling of the adatom frontier orbital is typically `` strong '' with the substrate tisr and `` weak '' with the substrate xsr s ( x = c or n ) ( as in case d and in cases a  c in fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] , respectively ) .",
    "a concerted action of these couplings gives a qualitative explanation for the calculated adsorption energy trends on the tic(@xmath0)@xcite and tin(@xmath0)@xcite surfaces .",
    "the tisr is present on the tix(@xmath0 ) surfaces but not on the ( @xmath34 ) ones .",
    "the xsr s are found in the tix(@xmath0 ) uvb s .    in",
    "the first mentioned coupling above , the large overlap of the localized tisr with the adatom orbital causes a strong adatom  tisr interaction ( in the na sense ) .",
    "well - separated bonding and antibonding states of mixed adsorbate and ti character are then formed ( case d in fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] ) .",
    "the bonding - state energy lies below the free - adatom and tisr levels , while the antibonding state resides above the tisr level .    in the other coupling , the bonding adatom",
    "tisr level interacts with the xsr s present in the substrate uvb . due to the short range of the xsr s ( compared to the tisr ) , this interaction is weak ( in the na sense ) and causes a mixture of broadening and shifting of the bonding adlevel  tisr state . a state located in the middle of the uvb is mainly broadened ( case b in fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] ) , while a state at the edge of the uvb is mainly shifted away from the uvb center of mass ( cases a and c in fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] ) .",
    "evidence for this concerted coupling is given by detailed analyses of the calculated adsorbate - induced dos s ( @xmath26dos s ) and of real - space visualizations of the kohn - sham wave functions .",
    "these show that upon adsorption , there are ( i ) a sharp decrease in dos at the tisr energy ; ( ii ) a sharp increase of dos just above the tisr energy ; ( iii ) depending on the adatom species , narrow or broad bands of mainly adatom character at the edge of or within the substrate uvb energy range , respectively ; ( iv ) a depletion of x - localized uvb states at the xsr energies ; and ( v ) a formation of adatom - localized sub - peaks in between the energies of the substrate xsr s . points ( i)(iii ) show that bonding and antibonding adlevel  tisr states are formed , while points ( iii)(v ) prove a coupling between the bonding adlevel  tisr state and the xsr s in the substrate uvb .",
    "more detailed analyses of the trends in calculated @xmath26dos s and kohn - sham wave functions for second- and third - period adatoms on tix(111 ) surfaces show that ( i ) the magnitude of the dos reduction at the tisr energy decreases successively as the adatom number @xmath35 increases along a period and ( ii ) the adatom ",
    "x bonding character of the adatom - localized peaks increases as the adatom number @xmath35 increases along a period .",
    "these trends , which arise from the successive lowering of the adlevel energy as @xmath35 increases , indicate that the adatom ",
    "tisr coupling decreases in strength along each adatom period , towards the right in the periodic table , while the contribution of the xsr s to the bonding increases .",
    "such trends provide a basis for understanding the calculated trends in atomic adsorption energies .",
    "for instance , the maximum for the group - vi adatoms ( o and s ) is explained in terms of a stronger coupling to the substrate csr s . on the other hand ,",
    "the weaker bonding of group - vii adatoms ( f and cl ) is explained by a weakened coupling to the csr s , due to the adatom state being almost fully ionized by its interaction with the tisr .",
    "thus , the f and cl adsorbates lack almost any covalent interaction with the substrate uvb and their adsorption is practically ionic in nature , as confirmed by bader and charge - density analyses .",
    "also , the almost equal adsorption strengths of c and n can be explained in terms of the opposite trends in adatom  tisr and adatom  csr coupling strengths found for varying @xmath35 values .    on the same basis ,",
    "the ccm is also able to describe changes in adsorption energies arising from changes in adsorption site , _ i.e. _ , between fcc , hcp , and top o adatoms on tic(@xmath0).@xcite      the calculated energetics and electronic structures of atomic adsorption on the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces described in section  [ sec : ads ] can be analyzed in the same way as described above for tix(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the fact that upon adsorption the tmsr s and csr s are quenched on all considered surfaces shows that both types of resonance participate in the substrate ",
    "adatom bond .",
    "the strong character of the adatom ",
    "tmsr bonds is evidenced by the formation of well - separated bonding and antibonding states of mixed adatom and tm character , at energies below and above the tmsr s , respectively .",
    "the weak character of the adatom ",
    "csr bonds is confirmed by the broadening and/or shift of the bonding adatom ",
    "tmsr level .",
    "the exception is scc(@xmath0 ) , on which the adatom ",
    "csr coupling approaches a strong na character , with a strong depletion of csr states in the middle of the uvb and the formation of separated bonding and antibonding states below and above the uvb , respectively .",
    "this is due to the stronger csr s on this surface , which in turn arises from the stronger c  c bonds in bulk scc than in the other tmcs.@xcite also , the adatom  tmsr coupling is qualitatively different on scc(111 ) , compared to the other tmc s , as the tmsr of clean scc(111 ) lies above @xmath15 and is thus empty before adsorption .",
    "thus , the basic adsorption mechanism is the same on all the considered tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces , implying that the general applicability of the ccm includes tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces .",
    "in addition , scc(111 ) provides a playground for testing the contribution of the adlevel  csr coupling to the total adsorption strength .    in the following ,",
    "we give more explicit support to the applicability of the ccm to the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces by showing that the ccm can be used to understand the major features of the calculated atomic and molecular adsorption - energy trends on the considered tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : ads_on_tmx_all_ads_sub](b ) shows the calculated energy values for atomic adsorption on tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces as functions of the substrate tm group number . in this subsection",
    "we show that the ccm can capture its main trends .    in a simple molecular two - level picture ,",
    "the strength of a bond is related to the energy shift between the levels of the isolated constituents and of the hybridized states resulting from the coupling . in a simplified version of the newns model , an adsorbate and the active part of the substrate",
    "can be viewed as such a `` molecule''.@xcite accordingly , from the calculated @xmath26dos s the bond strength can be extracted as the energy difference between the final bonding adatom level ( _ i.e. _ , after coupling to both tmsr and csr s ) and the tmsr peak in the surface dos .",
    "the ccm is then able to explain the trends in bond strength by relating this energy difference to concerted adatom  tmsr and adatom  csr interactions .    in the following ,",
    "we employ such an approach to understand the qualitatively different trends in @xmath25 values for c and o adatoms , as the substrate tm group number increases from iv to vi [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_on_tmx_all_ads_sub](b ) ] .    for c , the @xmath25 values are approximately constant between groups iv and vi . the calculated @xmath26dos s ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : c_deltados_all_substrates ] ) show that the final bonding adatom level lies at the upper edge of the uvb on all considered substrates .",
    "thus on all these substrates , the energy difference between the final adatom level and the original substrate tmsr is approximately constant .",
    "this implies that the result of the concerted action of the adatom  tmsr and adatom ",
    "csr s interactions is approximately constant .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : c_deltados_all_substrates ] shows that the dos s of all substrates resemble the same na type of adlevel ",
    "csr s interaction , that is , type c in fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] .",
    "for o , with its lower @xmath36 level , the @xmath25 values decrease strongly as the substrate tm group number increases from iv to vi .",
    "this is reflected in the calculated @xmath26dos s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : o_deltados_all_substrates ] ) by a strongly decreasing energy difference between the final adatom level and the original substrate tmsr peak .",
    "thus , in contrast to c , for o the concerted action of the two types of coupling yields qualitatively different results . in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : c_deltados_all_substrates ] shows dos s that correspond to adlevel ",
    "csr s interactions that vary in a qualitative way from ( _ _ cf .",
    "_ _ fig .",
    "[ fig : na ] ) na case a ( on group iv ) , to na case b ( on group v ) , and to na case c ( on group vi ) . as a consequence , the adlevel ",
    "csr s interactions cause a downward energy shift ( on group iv ) , a broadening ( on group v ) , and an upward energy shift ( on group vi ) of the bonding adlevel .",
    "we also notice that for both adsorbates the antibonding adatom ",
    "tmsr level lies above @xmath15 ( and is thus empty ) for all substrates except the group - vi tmc s @xmath1-moc and wc .",
    "this filling of antibonding states implies an extra decrease in adatom ",
    "tmc bond strength , as group v @xmath37 vi .",
    "indeed , this can be seen in the calculated @xmath25 trend for c [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_on_tmx_all_ads_sub](b ) ] .    for all adsorbates except f",
    ", the calculated @xmath25 values increase from scc(@xmath0 ) to tic(@xmath0 ) . as described above , the adlevel ",
    "csr s interaction is more pronounced on scc(@xmath0 ) than on the other tmc s , thus approaching the strong na limit . also , the adatom  tmsr coupling is qualitatively different on scc(@xmath0 ) , due to the tmsr of clean scc(@xmath0 ) lying above @xmath15 and being thus empty before adsorption .",
    "the weaker adsorption on scc(@xmath0 ) can thus be understood to be due to the qualitatively different interaction with the two types of sr s .",
    "the adsorption - energy trends with respect to adsorbate [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_on_tmx_all_ads_sub](a ) ] show ",
    "m-shaped @xmath25 trends for most of the considered tmc s .",
    "the trend on tic(@xmath0 ) was analyzed in ref .   and explained within the ccm to arise from competing opposite trends in adsorbate ",
    "tmsr and adsorbate ",
    "csr s interactions .    the calculated @xmath26dos s for the here considered tmc s ( illustrated for vc in fig .",
    "[ fig : vc_deltados_all_adsorbates ] ) show trends that are similar to those found for tic . at the same time , the @xmath25 trends for all considered tmc s resemble the one on tic(@xmath0 ) , with a local maximum for the o adatom",
    ". however , on group - v tmc s the calculated @xmath25 values for o are approximately equal to the ones for c , and on group - vi tmc s the o values are smaller than the ones for c. thus , the chemisorption strength of o appears to weaken relative to c as the substrate tm group number increases .",
    "this can be understood to be a consequence of the different @xmath25 trends for c and o that were described in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc_substrate ] above , with the adsorption strength decreasing much faster for o than for c as the tm group number increases from iv to vi .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath25 values for scc(@xmath0 ) show a monotonic increase between b and o adatoms . as described above , the adlevel ",
    "csr s interaction is stronger on scc(@xmath0 ) than on the other considered tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces .",
    "therefore , the monotonically increasing trend ( as b @xmath37 o ) of the adlevel ",
    "csr s coupling contribution to the adatom ",
    "tmc bond is stronger on scc(@xmath0 ) .",
    "finally , on all substrates there is a sharp decrease in adsorption energy , as o @xmath37 f. this arises from the weakened adlevel ",
    "csr s interaction , which is due to the fact that the adatom is almost fully ionic from its interaction with the tmsr , as described previously on tic(@xmath0).@xcite      the adsorption energies of the considered molecular adsorbates nh@xmath21 ( @xmath38 ) on vc(@xmath0 ) show a decreasing trend as @xmath24 increases ( table  [ tab : nhx_on_vc ] ) .",
    "this trend can be understood in terms of the ccm as arising from the concerted coupling between each molecular orbital and the two types of sr s .",
    "the quenchings of both tmsr and csr s in the calculated @xmath26dos s for nh@xmath21 on vc(@xmath0 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vc_deltados_nhx ] ) indicate the presence of couplings to both types of sr s .",
    "in addition , the adsorbate - projected ldos s show strongly bound sharp peaks of mixed n and h character as well as more delocalized regions of only n character within the uvb .",
    "a comparison with calculated dos s for the free nh@xmath21 molecules shows that the sharp peaks correspond to low - energy molecular levels that interact weakly with the substrate sr s . on the other hand ,",
    "the delocalized regions arise from the coupling of higher - energy molecular levels with the sr s , in a way that is similar to the adsorption of atomic n. figure  [ fig : vc_deltados_nhx ] shows that as the number @xmath24 of h atoms in the molecule increases , the interaction of the higher - energy molecular levels with the sr s weakens , thus lowering the adsorption strength .",
    "the above discussion shows that for the atomic and molecular adsorption on the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces a picture based on the concerted action of two types of adatom  substrate interactions applies .",
    "it can be used to describe key features of the calculated adsorption - strength and electronic - structure trends . in this concerted - coupling model ( ccm ) , two types of sr s participate in the bond , tm - localized sr s ( tmsr ) and c - localized sr s ( csr ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the ccm is valid for atomic adsorption on all the considered tmc(111 ) surfaces .      to be able to describe the variations in adsorption strength in a simple yet efficient way , a descriptor @xmath27 , defined as the mean energy of the tmsr , can be introduced.@xcite due to the approximately constant energy difference between tmsr and csr s in the considered compounds , such a descriptor is able to capture the important variations of both tmsr and csr energy trends while being at the same time both conceptually simple and measurable or calculable .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : e_ads_vs_epsilonccm ] , which shows a linear correlation between our calculated @xmath25 values and @xmath27 for each of the considered atomic adsorbates , also when the results of ref .",
    "are significantly extended .",
    "the exception is scc(@xmath0 ) , which is a consequence of the mentioned qualitative difference in electronic structure of this surface , that is , an empty tmsr and a strong adlevel  csr coupling .",
    "as discussed above , the variations in the gradients of the lines for the different adsorbates can be understood within the ccm from the details in the interactions between the adlevel and the different sr s .",
    "correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath27 for the atomic adsorbates h , b , c , n , o and f.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in ref .  , linear correlations are also found between @xmath27 and the molecular adsorption energies of nh , nh@xmath2 , and nh@xmath3 , as well as the activation - energy barriers for n@xmath2 . this is a consequence of the fact that both atomic and molecular adsorptions appear to follow the same basic mechanisms of the ccm , as argued above . as a consequence ,",
    "we show in ref .   that scaling and brnsted - evans - polanyi ( bep ) relations apply for adsorption on tmc(111 ) surfaces .",
    "such findings are of importance for the design of new catalysts .",
    "the possibility to understand materials has today increased considerably , as dft has developed into a predictive theory",
    ". one obvious application of dft is to calculate numbers for bonding strengths , structure parameters and coordinates , _ etc . _",
    "another , slightly more demanding , application is to look for more detailed information and develop conceptual frameworks and models in which we can formulate our understanding and on which we can base our further thinking , including ideas about new materials .",
    "we have found that various densities of states ( dos s ) are excellent tools for such understanding and vehicles for thought . in our approach ,",
    "extensive use of total , local , projected , and difference dos s are cornerstones in the building - up of a conceptual framework and model .",
    "this study deals with understanding the atomic and molecular adsorption on the tmc(@xmath0 ) surfaces using such a detailed electronic structure analysis approach . by extensive dft calculations on scc ,",
    "tic , vc , zrc , nbc , @xmath1-moc , tac , and wc , we study trends in clean surface properties , adsorption energies , and various dos s . in brief , we find that only a certain part of the surface - localized electronic structure , corresponding to the tm - localized ( tmsr ) and the c - localized ( csr ) surface resonances ( sr s ) are of importance to understand the trends in adsorption energies from one tmc surface to another and from one adsorbate to another . despite the tm termination of the investigated tmc surfaces , the second - layer c atoms are found to play a crucial role in the chemisorption .",
    "this is particularly evident on the scc(@xmath0 ) surface , where the tmsr is empty and where the csr s are particularly strong .",
    "having thus identified the key parameters , we possess the foundations for a concerted - coupling model ( ccm ) in which trends in adsorption strength are the result of a concerted action of both adsorbate  tmsr and adsorbate ",
    "csr s couplings .",
    "this has earlier been shown for the tic and tin ( @xmath0 ) surfaces@xcite but the breadth and versatility are here shown by applications to other tmc s and trends , including : adsorption trends with respect to substrate , adsorption trends with respect to atomic adsorbate , adsorption trends on scc(@xmath0 ) , adsorption trend for group - vii adatoms , and molecular - adsorption trends .",
    "this deepens the interpretation of the model and broadens its usefulness .",
    "the applicability of the ccm to both atomic and molecular adsorption opens up the possibility to study reactions for , _",
    "e.g. _ , catalytic applications on this class of materials .",
    "for example , it allows the formulation of a single descriptor @xmath39 for the adsorption strength.@xcite also , it implies the existence of scaling relations between molecular and atomic adsorption strengths as well as brnsted - evans - polanyi relations.@xcite    since the ccm framework is based on rudimentary bonding principles with general applicability , we believe that it is possible to generalize it to other materials that possess surface - localized states . we have already shown its applicability to atomic adsorption on tin(@xmath0)@xcite and believe that the same chemisorption mechanism should be valid for other nitrides .",
    "ligand and vacancy systems have been shown to belong to the group of materials where the ccm applies,@xcite as do certain tm surfaces,@xcite where , however , it does not need to replace the sufficient and natural _ d_-band model .",
    "natural extensions should include tm oxides , sulfides , and borides .",
    "design of materials , including atomic - scale engineering , is also an enticing prospect for further applications .",
    "valuable discussions with anders hellman are acknowledged .",
    "the calculations were performed at hpc2n and nsc via the swedish national infrastructure for computing .",
