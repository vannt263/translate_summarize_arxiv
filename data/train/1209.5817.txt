    "various three - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories have attracted much interest as the theories describing the low energy dynamics of multiple m2/d2-branes with and without background fluxes .",
    "much of recent interests are focused on the superconformal chern - simons matter theory of aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ( abjm )  @xcite , which describes the dynamics of m2-branes on @xmath7 orbifold singularity .",
    "it was known that the circle compactification of this theory via the mukhi - papageorgakis ( mp ) higgsing procedure  @xcite leads to the three - dimensional @xmath8 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory  @xcite , which is the low energy effective theory of multiple d2-branes .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "though the circle compactification of the @xmath9 supersymmetry - preserving mass - deformed abjm ( mabjm ) theory  @xcite can also be taken into account , the mp higgsing procedure can not be implemented as a method of the circle compactification .",
    "this is because in the @xmath9 mabjm thoery all the scalar fields are massive and the bosonic potential does not involve any flat direction allowing an infinitely large vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields . the latter is a crucial requirement for the application of mp higgsing procedure .",
    "the origin of the mass - deformation in the @xmath9 mabjm theory is identified by the presence of wess - zumino ( wz ) type coupling to special type of constant four - form and the dual seven - form field strengths  @xcite in the infinite m2-brane tension limit .",
    "as we discussed in the previous paragraph , one can not apply the mp higgsing procedure to the @xmath9 mabjm theory . in this regard ,",
    "we construct some supersymmetric mabjm theories with flat directions , which let the mp higgsing procedure possible .",
    "subsequently , we relate the resulting theories after the mp higgsing to three - dimensional mass - deformed super yang - mills ( msym ) theories .",
    "to be specific , we start from the gauge - invariant wz - type coupling  @xcite in the abjm theory and then apply the formalism to a generic constant field strength in the infinite m2-brane tension limit .    by appropriate choices of the fluxes we construct mabjm theories preserving @xmath0 supersymmetries .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the partially supersymmetric mabjm theories is the fact that they always contain certain number of massless scalar fields which result in some flat directions of the bosonic potential .",
    "we show that the mp higgsing of the @xmath10 mabjm theory leads to a msym theory , with the same number of supersymmetry .",
    "this mass - deformed theory is equivalent to one of the three distinct three - dimensional msym theories , which contain one massless vector multiplet and three massive matter multiplets  @xcite .",
    "the three distinct theories are obtained by making different choices of the mass parameters of the six massive fermionic fields of the matter multiplets .",
    "similarly , we show that the @xmath11 mabjm theory is equivalent to a unique @xmath11 msym in three dimensions .",
    "we also notice that one of the three distinct @xmath10 msym theories , but not the one obtained from the @xmath10 mabjm theory , is equivalent to the one from the dimensional reduction of the four - dimensional @xmath12 msym theory studied by polchinski - strassler  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 msym is also equivalent to the one from the dimensional reduction of the @xmath13 msym theory in four - dimensions . in the framework of gauge / gravity correspondence ,",
    "three - dimensional msym theories have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ abjm - h ]",
    "we study the deformation of the abjm theory with generic wz - type couplings to constant background fluxes . for later convenience",
    "we single out only the wz - type coupling which survives in the limit of infinite tension of m2-brane . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we appropriately choose the fluxes in order to preserve certain amount of supersymmetry . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we apply the mp higgsing procedure to the partially supersymmetric mabjm theories and obtain the corresponding msym theories .",
    "we then study the classification of these theories in relation with the dimensional reductions of four - dimensional msym theories .",
    "the detailed procedure of the dimensional reduction of the @xmath12 , @xmath14 theories is included in appendix a. section [ sec5 ] is devoted to discussions and future research directions .",
    "the abjm action  @xcite is given by a chern - simons matter theory with @xmath9 supersymmetry and u(@xmath15)@xmath16u(@xmath15 ) gauge symmetry , @xmath17 where @xmath18 the four complex scalar fields @xmath19 @xmath20 represent the eight directions @xmath21 @xmath22 transverse to the m2-branes with @xmath23 this action has @xmath9 supersymmetry with the following transformation rules @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "since the abjm theory describes low energy dynamics of @xmath15 stacked m2-branes , it is intriguing to consider this theory in the background of a constant transverse four - form and the dual seven - form field strengths .",
    "interaction between the m2-branes and the background three - form gauge fields is depicted by the wz - type coupling . in the presence of a constant transverse four - form field strength @xmath26 ,",
    "the components of the corresponding three - form gauge field @xmath27 have the following transverse scalar dependence : @xmath28 here we employed the index notations of  @xcite , where the unbarred indices are contracted with bifundamental fields while the barred ones are contracted with anti - bifundamental fields .",
    "we can set the constant components of @xmath27 in to zero by using the gauge transformation of the three - form gauge field , @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , one can not construct u(@xmath30u(@xmath15 ) gauge - invariant wz - type coupling with linear @xmath31  @xcite .",

    ", the three - form coupling in and all the six - form couplings in except the first term can be neglected .",

    "therefore , the action in is simplified as @xmath47 as we will see later , the quartic flux term of the @xmath9 mabjm theory can be expressed by the wz - type coupling .",
    "in addition , different choice of constant flux can be taken into account in m - theory .",
    "if the masses of the fermionic and bosonic fields are appropriately chosen , the supersymmetry is partially preserved .",
    "in this section we discuss possible mass deformations of the abjm theory in the presence of the constant flux term , which preserve some amount of supersymmetry .",
    "we start by introducing general gauge - invariant mass terms for scalar and fermion fields in addition to the quartic wz - type coupling , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constant mass matrices . then the total lagrangian is written as @xmath51    the corresponding supersymmetry transformation rules in for the scalar and gauge fields are unaffected by the mass - deformation",
    "while those for the fermionic fields are modified by @xmath52    from the invariance of the total lagrangian under the total supersymmetry transformation @xmath53 , we fix the values of @xmath54 , and @xmath55 according to the number of supersymmetry .",
    "since @xmath56 , we need to verify only the following invariance , @xmath57 up to total derivative . using the supersymmetry transformation rules in and ,",
    "one can verify under the conditions , @xmath58    in order to check the validity of this general setup , we apply it to the well - known maximal supersymmetry preserving case  @xcite . in this case",
    "su(4 ) r - symmetry of the abjm theory is broken to su(2)@xmath16su(2)@xmath16u(1 ) due to the mass matrix @xmath59 with a mass parameter @xmath60 .",
    "then we determine the bosonic mass matrix and the nonvanishing components of the constant four - form tensor from the conditions  as @xmath61 this result exactly matches the known result for the case of maximally supersymmetric mabjm theory  @xcite and the choice is unique up to field redefinitions  @xcite .    in the subsequent two subsections , we consider the cases with flat directions in bosonic potentials , where some of scalar fields and corresponding superpartners are massless . in those cases some of the supersymmetries",
    "are necessarily broken .",
    "the models with @xmath10 and @xmath11 supersymmetries are constructed .",
    "let us consider a bosonic potential which is flat along only one complex scalar field . by supersymmetry",
    ", the corresponding single complex fermion field should be massless while the other three fermion fields remains to be massive . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the fermionic mass matrix of the three massive fermionic fields as @xmath62 where @xmath63 s @xmath64 are real mass parameters .",
    "then we notice that @xmath65 due to the condition . in order to satisfy the conditions in and",
    ", we should keep only one complex component of @xmath66 and its complex conjugate nonvanishing . to be specific , we choose nonvanishing @xmath67 and then @xmath68 is also nonvanishing by the reality condition of @xmath66 .",
    "substitution of these into determine @xmath69 as @xmath70 and then nonvanishing components of @xmath71 are determined by as @xmath72 one may also choose different nonvanishing components , for instance , @xmath73 or @xmath74 , however , the results are equivalent to the aforementioned case of the nonvanishing @xmath67 , up to field redefinition .      in order to obtain the mass - deformed theory with @xmath11 supersymmetry , we have to turn on the mass term for two complex scalar fields .",
    "then two complex fermionic fields become massive while the other two are massless .",
    "this implements an appropriate choice for the corresponding fermionic mass matrix @xmath75 the conditions in  are satisfied only when we keep two nonvanishing complex supersymmetric parameters and their complex conjugates .",
    "one possible choice is nonvanishing @xmath74 and @xmath67 and then @xmath76 and @xmath68 are also nonvanishing . with this choice we read the bosonic mass matrix from , @xmath77 and the following nonvanishing components of @xmath71 from @xmath78 like the @xmath10 case in subsection [ n=2 ] , this choice is unique up to field redefinition .    in the original abjm theory",
    "it was conjectured that the @xmath9 supersymmetry is enhanced to @xmath8 at chern - simons levels @xmath79",
    "the existence of such additional @xmath10 supersymmetries was verified in terms of the monopole operators  @xcite . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the supersymmetry enhancement is not possible due to orbifolding . on the other hand , in order to implement the mp higgsing procedure one has to move the m2-branes away from the orbifold singularity and this leads to an enhancement of the supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "for instance , after the mp higgsing procedure , the @xmath9 supersymmetry of the abjm theory is enhanced to the @xmath8 supersymmetry of the three - dimensional sym theory .",
    "the latter theory flows to the supersymmetry enhanced abjm theory on flat transverse space ( @xmath81 at the ir fixed point  @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall show in the next section , there is no supersymmetry enhancement after the mp higgsing procedure in the @xmath0 mabjm theories .",
    "this implies the absence of the supersymmetry enhancement in the @xmath0 mabjm theories , unlike the @xmath9 mabjm theory .",
    "the dimensional reduction of the abjm theory with u(@xmath30u(@xmath15 ) gauge symmetry  @xcite via the mp higgsing procedure @xcite leads to the three - dimensional @xmath8 sym theory with u(@xmath15 ) gauge symmetry  @xcite . in ref .",
