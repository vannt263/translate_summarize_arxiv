    "the dynamics of inertial particles , i.e. small spherical particles immersed in a fluid flow has been studied extensively over the years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such dynamical systems have been considered to be the simplest models for the study of transport and mixing properties of impurities in fluid flows , which are of interest in a variety of practical situations .",
    "examples include aerosols and pollutants in the atmosphere , micro - structures suspended in fluids , bubbles in liquids , slurries in industrial mixers , droplet formation by cloud turbulence @xcite , planet formation around developing stars in the universe @xcite and many others .",
    "these systems exhibit rich and complex behavior , and demonstrate phenomena that are interesting from the point of view of dynamical systems theory .",
    "the lagrangian dynamics of small spherical tracers in nonuniform and incompressible flows is described by the maxey - riley equation @xcite , under the assumption that the fluid around the tracers is locally incompressible and of uniform density . for",
    "neutrally buoyant tracers , after various approximations @xcite , the maxey - riley equation leads to a set of minimal equations known as the embedding equations @xcite .",
    "the same procedure has been generalized for the case of non - neutrally buoyant tracers when the particle density differs from the fluid density .",
    "the fluid dynamics is actually embedded in the particle dynamics and may be recovered under appropriate limits .",
    "the particle motion in the flow turns out to be compressible and thereby gives rise to regions of contraction and expansion without affecting the incompressible nature of the lagrangian fluid flow .",
    "thus , the embedding dynamics is dissipative in nature .",
    "map analogues of the embedding equation , which preserve the features of the embedding dynamics have also been constructed @xcite . in the case where the densities of the fluid and the particles do not match ,",
    "their trajectories are expected to differ .",
    "this can have interesting consequences .",
    "it has been observed that in two - dimensional chaotic flows , aerosols are pushed out from the kam ( kolomogrov - arnold - moser ) islands .",
    "the opposite tendency has been reported for bubbles @xcite .",
    "however , neutrally buoyant particles may get detached from the fluid - parcel trajectories , and settle in the kam islands .",
    "this behavior suggested an interesting application , a method of targeting kam islands in hamiltonian flows .",
    "the generalization of this method has been studied for hamiltonian maps as well , and has been called the method of the bailout embedding @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the effects of the basset - boussinesq history term has been recently considered for the sedimentation and rising of inertial particles in a @xmath0 convective , time - periodic , cell flow @xcite .",
    "bail - out embeddings of two dimensional flows , as well as maps have been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the study of the bail - out embeddings of two - dimensional area - preserving maps @xcite indicated that the dissipation parameter of the system , as well as the density difference plays a crucial role in the dynamical behaviors of bubbles and aerosols .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the embedding map can target periodic orbits and chaotic behavior in both the aerosol and bubble regimes depending on values of the dissipation parameter @xmath1 , and the mass ratio parameter @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , an attractor merging and widening crisis was observed in a certain parameter region for the aerosol .",
    "crisis induced intermittency was also found at some points in the parameter space .",
    "here we study the bail - out embedding of a @xmath3 volume preserving map .",
    "it is expected that the presence of an extra dimension in the phase space will have important contributions to the clustering and transport properties seen in the phase space .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the behavior of the bail - out embedding of a volume preserving @xmath3 map , the abc map @xcite .",
    "abc flows @xcite are important models in the context of magnetohydrodynamics , and can sustain the dynamo effect , i.e. a magnetic field can be generated and maintained by the motion of an electrically conducting fluid .",
    "the flows can show streamlines and periodic behavior as well as chaotic regimes accessed by a series of bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the spatial structure of the magnetic field is influenced by the velocity field .",
    "the map analogue of the abc flow @xcite demonstrates similar effects .",
    "the velocity field of the abc map has been studied both analytically and numerically in detail by dombre _",
    "the bail - out embedding of this volume preserving map has also been studied by cartwright _",
    "@xcite for neutral particles , and demonstrates the accumulation of impurities in tubular vortical structures , the detachment of particles from fluid parcels near hyperbolic invariant lines , and the formation of @xmath3 structures .",
    "our study of the abc map examines spherical tracers whose density is different from that of the fluid .",
    "we discuss both the two - action and one - action cases of the map , but concentrate on the two - action case here . for this case , as in the @xmath4 case , the aerosols and bubbles show distinctly different behavior .",
    "the system has a rich phase diagram wherein periodic structures , hyperchaotic regimes and chaotic behavior is seen , depending on the dissipation parameter , and buoyancy effects . we also observe unstable dimension variability ( udv ) leading to crisis in this system in the aerosol regime , for certain values of the dissipation and buoyancy parameters .",
    "the system also shows a riddled basin of attraction and udv in the bubble regime . this behavior can have interesting practical consequences .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the bailout embedding method is outlined in sec .",
    "the embedded version of the base @xmath5 map is constructed in section iii .",
    "the aerosol and bubble regimes in the two - action case are investigated in section iv .",
    "the phase diagram of the two - action case is discussed in section v and compared with the phase diagram of the @xmath4 standard map case studied earlier .",
    "we discuss the one - action case briefly in section vi .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section vii .",
    "the transport of passive point particle tracers in the fluids is usually studied using the lagrangian framework , wherein @xmath6 here @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the particle velocities , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the components of the fluid velocity field @xmath13 .",
    "the obvious advantage of working in this framework is that the particle advection problem is now expressed as a finite dimensional dynamical system .",
    "if the density of the particle tracers is different from that of the fluid , then the problem needs to be tackled using the maxey - riley framework . in the lagrangian description ,",
    "the advection of spherical particles in an incompressible fluid is given by the maxey - riley equation @xcite which has the form :    @xmath14 ) \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{9\\rho_{f}}{2a}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{\\pi}}\\int_{0}^{t } { \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(t-\\xi)}}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}(\\textbf{v}-\\textbf{u}-\\frac{a^2}{6}\\nabla^2\\textbf{u } ) d\\xi } \\label{maxey - riley}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here * v * represents the particle velocity , * u * the fluid velocity , @xmath15 the density of the particle , @xmath16 the density of the fluid , and @xmath17 , * a * and * g * represent the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , the radius of the particle and the acceleration due to gravity respectively .",
    "the first term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ maxey - riley ] ) represents the force exerted by the undisturbed flow on the particle , the second term represents the buoyancy , the third term represents the stokes drag , the fourth term represents the added mass , and the last term is the basset - boussinesq history force term .",
    "the derivative @xmath18 where @xmath19 is taken along the path of the fluid element , and the derivative @xmath20 is taken along the trajectory of the particle .",
    "the maxey - riley equation is derived under the assumption that the particle radius , and the reynolds number are small , and so are the velocity gradients around the particle .",
    "it is also assumed that the initial velocities of the particle and fluid are the same .",
    "a full review of the problem is found in @xcite .    under the low reynolds number approximation , with negligible buoyancy effects , and retaining only the bernoulli , stokes drag and taylor added terms , we arrive at the following simplified equation of motion for the motion of a spherical particle immersed in the fluid @xcite : @xmath21    this equation has been derived under approximation that @xmath22 .",
    "expressing the equation in a non - dimensional form by proper rescaling of length , time and velocity by scale factors @xmath23,@xmath24 , and @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath26 here , the parameter @xmath2 gives the mass ratio , @xmath27 .",
    "hence , values of @xmath28 correspond to the aerosol case and the values @xmath29 , @xmath30 corresponds to the bubble case , and the neutrally buoyant cases . defining the particle",
    "stoke s number @xmath31 and defining the dissipation parameter to be @xmath32 , the equation takes the form@xcite , @xmath33 let the base flow be represented by an area or volume preserving map , with the map evolution equation @xmath34 . a general bailout embedding for this map which represents the motion of the particle and encapsulates the essential features of eq .",
    "( [ bail0 ] ) may be constructed @xcite : @xmath35 in the case of inertial particles , the bailout embedding function @xmath36 may be chosen such that the embedding map takes the form @xcite : @xmath37 this can be expressed as @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the bailout embedding map .",
    "the dissipation parameter @xmath1 is a measure of contraction or expansion in the phase space of the particle s dynamics .",
    "the particle is said to have bailed out of the fluid trajectory when @xmath39 , where the new variable @xmath40 is defined to be the detachment of the particle from the local fluid parcel .",
    "the fluid dynamics is recovered under the limits @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this sense",
    ", the fluid dynamics is said to be embedded in the particle s equation .",
    "this map is dissipative with a phase space contraction rate which is @xmath44 .",
    "the configuration space contraction rate is proportional to @xmath45 for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we will use this version of the bail - out embedding map in all subsequent analysis .",
    "we consider the arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) map @xcite as the base map for the present study .",
    "the abc map exhibits almost all the basic features of interest in the evolution of a typical three dimensional , time periodic , volume preserving flow , the abc flow .",
    "this class of simple non - turbulent flows , first introduced by arnold is known to possess kam - like surfaces and generate chaotic streamlines . in the chaotic regions ,",
    "the flow has the beltrami property , i.e. the vorticity is parallel to the fluid velocity .",
    "the passive scalars immersed in such streamlines display chaotic advection , which considerably enhances the mixing and transport properties of passive scalars , as shown in the two - dimensional case of the blinking vortex model introduced by aref @xcite . moreover , childress @xcite demonstrated that the presence of chaotic streamlines in the flow is responsible for the growth of the magnetic field in the model of the kinematic dynamo effect .",
    "we use the following version of the abc map @xcite for our purpose :    align x_n+1=x_n+a(z_n ) + c(y_n ) + y_n+1=y_n+b(x_n+1 ) + a(z_n ) + z_n+1=z_n+c(y_n+1 ) + b(x_n+1 )    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the present work studies the advection of finite sized passive scalar particles in an incompressible three - dimensional flow for cases where the particle density differs from the fluid density .",
    "the motion of the advected particles is represented in lagrangian description by an embedding map with the volume preserving arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) map as the base map .",
    "the resulting embedded abc map is invertible and dissipative with two sets of parameters namely @xmath47 which belong to the base map and the mass ratio and dissipation parameters @xmath48 which enter due to the embedding .",
    "the two - action case of the map has been studied in both the regimes - aerosol and bubble , depending upon whether the mass ratio parameter , @xmath49 or @xmath29 .    in the two - action case ,",
    "the phase diagram for the system in the @xmath50 parameter space shows rich structures with complex dynamics .",
    "three type of dynamical behaviors - periodic orbits , chaotic and hyperchaotic regions are found to be present .",
    "the bubble regime is mostly hyperchaotic , but the aerosol regime also contains a tongue of hyperchaoticity at low values of dissipation .",
    "crisis induced intermittency in this region , and power law behavior for the characteristic times between bursts is seen in the neighborhood of the crisis .",
    "unstable dimension variability is also seen in this neighborhood .",
    "the bubble regime also shows the existence of multiple co - existing attractors , and a riddled basin of attraction .",
    "the observed riddling may be a consequence of a bubbling bifurcation , similar to that seen in the bailout embeddings of hamiltonian dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "this needs to be explored further , as well as the consequences of the riddling for clustering and the preferential concentration of particles , also need to be examined .",
    "we hope to do this in future work .",
    "the aerosol regime of the two action case exhibits a bifurcation diagram with rich structure .",
    "an interior crisis is seen in the system , and in fact , a number of windows of crisis are seen .",
    "a two ring attractor is seen in the post crisis setting , with trajectories which hop between the rings with period two .",
    "the transient to the two ring attractor shows scaling behavior .",
    "thus , our toy model shows a variety of phenomena which could lead to consequences for transport and pattern formation .",
    "clustering and concentration phenomena and their dependence on initial conditions have been insufficiently explored so far , even in model contexts .",
    "the present system constitutes an excellent toy model for exploring such phenomena .",
    "we hope to explore these phenomena as well as the drift and diffusive properties of this system in future work .",
    "a preliminary study has also been carried out for the one action case of the @xmath5 map , using the parameter values @xmath51 . here ,",
    "in the aerosol regime with @xmath52 , the largest le is negative for most of the range @xmath53 . here ,",
    "periodic attractors with even periods were seen .",
    "the bubble regime with @xmath54 showed fully hyperchaotic behavior where the two largest les were always positive in the range @xmath53 , and some of the phase space plots showed patched structure .",
    "however , a detailed study of the one action case remains to be carried out .",
    "it is expected that the presence of invariant surfaces in this case will lend interesting features to the drift and diffusion properties .",
    "it would also be interesting to connect the present method to other approaches , e.g. that of lagrangian coherent structure analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fact that the system studied here exhibits dynamical phenomena which are of theoretical interest , our observations may have implications in a variety of application contexts such as the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere and oceans , catalytic chemical reactions , coagulation of material particles in flows , plankton population in ocean etc .",
    "we also note that the transport properties and physical behavior of impurities in three dimensions are little understood at present .",
    "finally , given that the abc flow and map constitute models for magnetohydrodynamics , their dynamics and transport properties may have implications for magnetohydrodynamic properties like the dynamo effect .",
    "we hope to analyze these aspects , and their consequences for applications in future work .",
