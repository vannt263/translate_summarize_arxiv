    "extragalactic radio sources are uniquely well suited to probe clustering on the largest scales .",
    "radio surveys are in fact unaffected by dust extinction which may introduce in the observed large - scale distribution spurious features reflecting the inhomogeneous extinction due to galactic dust .",
    "moreover , due to their strong cosmological evolution , radio sources are very rare locally , so that radio samples are free from the profusion of local objects that dominate optically selected galaxy samples and tend to swamp very large - scale structures at cosmological distances ; thanks to the strong cosmological evolution , even relatively shallow radio surveys reach out to substantial redshifts .",
    "the nvss @xcite offers the most extensive sky coverage ( @xmath14 of the sky to a completeness limit of about 3 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) with sufficient statistics to allow an accurate determination of the angular correlation function , @xmath15 on scales of up to several degrees @xcite .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite it was shown that the observed nvss auto - correlation function ( acf ) hints at a positive value of @xmath0 at about the @xmath16 confidence level .",
    "this is because the acf is found to be still positive on angular scales @xmath17 , which , for the median source redshift ( @xmath18 ) , correspond to linear scales where the correlation function should be negative if the density fluctuation field is gaussian . a positive @xmath0 adds power on large angular scales , accounting for the observed acf .",

    "these effects exactly cancel out if the potential @xmath5 is time independent , such as in the matter dominated era , when the fractional density contrast @xmath22 is proportional to the scale factor @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 and no isw is produced .",
    "however , when dark energy ( or curvature ) becomes important at later times , the potential evolves as the photon passes through it and @xmath25 , producing additional cmb anisotropies .    the late - time isw effect can thereby be a powerful tool for probing dark energy and its evolution",

    "@xcite ) .    from the two left - hand panels of figure  [ fig : ngeffect ]",
    ", one can see that a positive @xmath0 enhances the amplitudes of the auto - correlation and cross - correlation power spectra especially on large angular scales ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "consequently , the amplitudes of the acf and ccf are also enhanced ( right - hand panels of figure [ fig : ngeffect ] ) .",
    "the acf remains positive up to angular scales @xmath17 where , for the adopted redshift distribution and a redshift - independent @xmath73 , the acf is expected to become negative .",
    "the lower left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : ngeffect ] shows that the effects of non - gaussianity on the cross - correlation power spectrum become very large for the lowest multipoles .",
    "actually , most of the non - gaussian contribution to the ccf comes from @xmath77 , corresponding to angular scales @xmath78 .",
    "its detection therefore requires uniform sky coverage up to very large scales , but this is very difficult to achieve observationally .",
    "for example , in the case of nvss sources , very small modulations of the source surface density on very large scales , such as those of interest here , are easily swamped by systematic variations of the survey effective depth correlated with the varying observing conditions @xcite . also , the `` integral constraint '' @xcite needs to be dealt carefully .",
    "in fact , the acf and ccf estimators involve differences between local values of some quantity and their mean value over the considered area ( see eqs .",
    "( [ acfest ] ) and ( [ ccfest ] ) ) .",
    "but if such area is not much larger than the correlation scale , the computed mean may differ from the true mean by a constant offset @xmath79 , not known a priori , that must therefore be considered as a free parameter .",
    "in this section we describe two lss probes , nvss radio sources and high redshift sdss dr6 qsos , and present observational determinations of their acf and ccf with the cmb .",
    "we start by confining our analysis to nvss sources brighter than 10 mjy , since the surface density distribution of fainter sources suffers from declination - dependent fluctuations @xcite .",
    "density gradients in the nvss catalog become increasingly unimportant as the source brightness threshold is increased ( see refs .",
    "also we mask the strip @xmath80 , where the catalog may be substantially affected by galactic emissions .",
    "the nvss source surface density at this threshold is @xmath81 and the redshift distribution at this flux limit has been recently determined by ref .",
    "their sample , complete to a flux density of 7.2 mjy , comprises 110 sources with @xmath82mjy , of which 78 ( 71% ) have spectroscopic redshifts , 23 have redshift estimates via the @xmath83@xmath84 relation for radio sources , and 9 were not detected in the @xmath83 band and therefore have a lower limit to @xmath84 .",
    "we adopt here the smooth description of this redshift distribution given by ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath85 the mean redshift of this sample is @xmath86 . from the nvss catalog we construct a pixelized map using the healpix software package @xcite with resolution @xmath87 , yielding pixel areas of @xmath88 .",
    "our acf estimator @xmath89 reads : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of sources in the i - th pixel , @xmath92 is the un - masked fraction of the pixel area , @xmath93 is the expectation value for the number of objects in the pixel area @xcite .",
    "the sum runs over all pixel pairs whose centers are separated by an angle @xmath36 .",
    "the equal weighting used here is nearly - optimal because of the uniform nvss sky coverage and because on large scales the noise is dominated by sample variance .",
    "we use @xmath94 angular bins , @xmath95 wide .",
    "the first one is centered at @xmath96 ( on smaller angular scales the dominant contribution to the angular correlation function comes from multiple components of individual radio galaxies ) ; the other 8 are centered at @xmath97 ( on still larger scales the signal may be affected or even dominated by spurious density gradients @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated nvss acf was previously found to be positive over the full range of angular scales we consider @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although the integral of @xmath15 over the full survey solid angle vanishes by construction .",
    "as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , for a gaussian distribution of primordial density fluctuations and a realistic redshift distribution for nvss sources , the @xmath15 must vanish at @xmath98 and become negative on larger scales unless the redshift dependence of the bias parameter for radio sources is drastically different from that of optical qsos .",
    "consistency with the clustering properties of the latter sources can be recovered allowing for a small amount of non - gaussianity ( @xmath99 ( @xmath2 ) @xcite ) .",
    "since the nvss covers most of the sky it can safely be assumed to provide a `` fair sample '' of the universe , so that the derived angular correlation function is not affected by the `` integral constraint '' significantly . nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have explored whether the indications of an excess ( compared to the gaussian case ) positive contribution to the acf on large scales may be due to a unexpectedly large * positive * offset @xmath79 ( a negative @xmath79 would obviously exacerbate the discrepancy with expectations from the gaussian case ) . to this end",
    "we have added to @xmath15 a constant @xmath79 and have marginalized over it , allowing this quantity to vary in the range [ @xmath100 , @xmath101 , where the lower limit means essentially zero ( we work on a logarithmic scale ) while the upper limit corresponds to the case where the offset accounts for the full clustering signal on the largest scales ( see ref .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath79 is about @xmath102 , i.e. negligibly small , confirming that the data do not show indications that @xmath15 is appreciably affected by the integral constraint . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath79 is weakly constrained by the data , and values much larger than the adopted upper limit are formally allowed .",
    "such large values of @xmath79 would imply that @xmath103 is negative on scales @xmath17 , and the indications of non - gaussianity would no longer be statistically significant .",
    "such values however are not physically plausible because @xmath79 is necessarily negligibly small when , as in the nvss case , the survey area is so much larger than any other relevant scale ( see sec .",

    "a potentially trickier issue are large - scale surface density gradients due to instrumental effects that may spuriously enhance the acf estimates .",
    "this issue has been extensively discussed by ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) who concluded that this effect is negligible if we restrict ourselves to a flux limit of 10 mjy , as we did .",
    "an upper limit to the magnitude of the effect is an offset of @xmath105 , that , as noted above , would account for the estimated clustering signal on the largest scales .",
    "having allowed @xmath79 to take on this value , we have automatically allowed for the corresponding decrease of the statistical significance of @xmath106 . as a further test of the possibility that the large - scale clustering is spuriously enhanced by surface density gradients due to instrumental effects",
    "we have redone the analysis restricting ourselves to sources above 20 mjy , for which such effects are negligible on all scales , so that @xmath107 . in spite of the poorer statistics we find indications of @xmath106 at approximately the same significance level as for the @xmath108mjy sample : @xmath109 ( @xmath2 error ) and @xmath110 ( 95% confidence level ) .",
    "to measure the ccf between the nvss number density map and the cmb map , we use the following estimator : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the cmb temperature in the @xmath113-th pixel and @xmath114 is the mean ( monopole ) value for the cmb temperature in the unmasked area .",
    "the results presented here rely on the 7 years internal linear combination ( ilc ) map of the cmb provided by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) team @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the using other cmb maps ( the 5 years ilc map by the wmap team and the improved ( cleaner ) map by ref .",
    "@xcite ) does not change the results in any significant way .",
    "we adopt the wmap kq75 mask , excluding about 30% of the sky at low galactic latitude , to avoid most of the residual galactic contamination . this mask",
    "is then combined with the nvss sky coverage ; regions of the nvss catalogue that may introduce spurious features because of missing snapshot observations and over - dense regions associated with bright of extended sources ( table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are also masked .    as shown in ",
    "[ sect : ng ] , the effect on the ccf of primordial non - gaussianity shows up primarily on very large angular scales , at variance with the acf for which the non - gaussian signal is localized at @xmath115 , as shown by ref .",

    "while it is true that these fluctuations should be , on average , uncorrelated with the cmb signal and therefore , on average , should not contribute to the ccf signal , we deal here with a single realization of the universe , and few independent modes ; in practice , the jackknife procedure we employ to estimate the errors is not suited to deal properly with such an effect .",

    "several data sets are combined : the sdss qsos , the nvss , 2mass etc .",
    "although they report their results to be dominated by nvss .",
    "our nvss ccf constraints on @xmath0 are consistent with theirs although with smaller error - bars due to the fact that we do not need to estimate the source redshift distribution from the correlations themselves .    for their sdss qso analysis ref .",
    "@xcite considered both the auto and cross correlation signals .",
    "@xcite used an extension of the dr3 qso sample that include many of the sources that subsequently were released with the dr6 sample : we use the more complete and better calibrated final official sdss dr6 qso catalog release @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite found that their qso sample at @xmath245 seem to suffer from contamination which they described to systematic calibration errors , and discarded this sample from their analysis .",
    "we have checked for this effect and find no evidence in the sample we use that the @xmath245 qsos have different contamination than the @xmath246 or that the two samples give different estimates of @xmath150 .",

    "we do not split the qso in redshift bins according to each source photometric redshift estimate as ref .",

    "@xcite had therefore to estimate the source redshift distribution from the ( cross)correlation signals themselves for each of their sub - samples ; we avoid this by using the independently - estimated full sample source redshift distribution .",
    "we also leave the stellar contamination as a free parameter to marginalize over , while ref .",
    "@xcite kept it fixed at the fiducial value .",

    "we use the extended press - schecter bias formulation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bst ] ) .",
    "we have however verified that if we use their bias model , fix the qso efficiency ( i.e. fraction of stellar contamination in the catalog ) to the fiducial value and do not marginalize over the constant offset we recover even central @xmath0 values fully consistent with theirs ( @xmath249 ( @xmath2 ) ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the largest effect driving the different central @xmath0 values we recover is the treatment of systematic effects -stellar contamination and offset .",
    "we should stress here that for the data in common between the different analyses , the results we find are fully consistent ( i.e. , at the @xmath2 confidence level ) with both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite results .",
    "our positive @xmath0 signal is driven by the nvss auto - correlation function and by the combination of sdss dr6 qso acf and ccf where the combination breaks the degeneracy with @xmath73 pushing he marginalized @xmath0 values slightly up .",
    "better knowledge of the bias of the sample and of systematic effects such as stellar contamination , calibration and selection effects are clearly needed to make further progress on this front ; this is especially relevant to future data - sets where the large volume surveyed will further reduce the statistical errors .",
    "we have investigated the constraints on the parameter @xmath0 , characterizing primordial non - gaussianity of the local type , coming from the currently available data sets best suited for this purpose , namely the observationally determined auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) of nvss radio sources and the sdss - dr6 qsos , and the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) of the surface density distributions of these sources with the wmap 7 years cmb map .",
    "the mean redshift of nvss sources is @xmath250 , and that of sdss - dr6 qsos is @xmath251 . as shown by ref .",
    "@xcite , a positive @xmath0 value ( @xmath252 ( @xmath2 ) , after allowing for the possible effect of the integral constraint ) , consistent with the constraints set by previous analyses , and especially by wmap data @xcite ( @xmath253 ( @xmath2 ) ) , can explain the positive acf signal detected on angular scales @xmath254 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the acf is expected to be @xmath255 for gaussian primordial perturbations . the qso acf yields constraints ( @xmath256 ( @xmath2 ) ) very similar to those inferred from wmap 7 year data .",
    "a signature of @xmath19 should also be present in the ccf between tracers of large scale structure and the map of cmb anisotropies .",
    "most of the signal , however , comes from low multipoles ( @xmath257 ) corresponding to very large angular scales where the signal may be blurred by systematic effects . in the case of nvss sources",
    "we have indeed found that the amplitude of the ccf with the cmb increases somewhat as we increase the adopted flux limit from @xmath258mjy , which is found to be adequate for the acf analysis but is still affected by small spurious large scale surface density gradients , to @xmath259mjy where such gradients become negligible .",
    "other possible systematic effects , such as contamination of the cmb map by point sources below the detection limit or by residual galactic emissions have been shown to be of minor importance .",
    "the nvss - cmb ccf however turned out to provide rather loose constraints on @xmath0 ( @xmath188 ( @xmath2 ) ) .",
    "the limited area covered by the sdss - dr6 qso catalog implies that the ccf is liable to a quite substantial effect of the integral constraint , at variance with the nvss case , where the area is 4 times larger ( the acfs of both nvss sources and sdss qsos are found to be insensitive to this effect ) .",
    "we have allowed for the integral constraint by adding to the estimated ccf a constant offset , treated as a free parameter , and marginalizing over it . in this way we obtained @xmath260 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the constraints on @xmath261 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) from nvss data and qso data , respectively .",
    "the tantalizing hints of a positive @xmath0 reported by ref . @xcite have survived the present more extensive analysis , involving other data sets . in order to reconcile the data with @xmath180 , we need to show that either the nvss catalog is affected by many - times larger systematic effects ( spurious large - scale correlations introduced by density gradients ) than known and quantified so far , or that the redshift evolution of the bias of these sources is radically different from that of their radio - quiet , optical counterpart .",
    "alternatively , one may question the accuracy of jackknife error - estimation especially when there are many non - zero off - diagonal elements in the covariance matrix . from ref .",
    "@xcite , we infer that jackknife can underestimate parameter errors by up to 30% .",
    "if the error bars were to be increased , @xmath0 would become more compatible with zero .",
