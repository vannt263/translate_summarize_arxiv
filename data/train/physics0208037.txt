    "the intermittency is in general associated with particular statistical properties of a fluctuating quantity like the fields describing the turbulent fluid or plasma . in certain regimes",
    "the nonlinear dynamics generates cuasi - coherent structures like vortices and the high correlations of these formations induce a non gaussian statistics .",
    "the random generation and destruction of cuasi - coherent vortices is one of the sources of intermittency in fluid and plasma .",
    "the slow algebraic decay of the spectrum at high wavenumbers is also considered a manifestation of the intermittency . in this case the random events consisting of rapid energy exchanges at small spatial scales should be attributed to vortex merging or island coalescence , processes which generates quasi - singular layers at reconnection . for other dynamical systems ,",
    "the intermittency is manifested as a random sequence of bursts , _",
    "i.e. _ time localised , strong increase of the amplitude of the field .",
    "these events separate states where the system preserves stationary properties , like are the regular flows or the turbulence with stationary statistical properties . during such an event , which is very short in time ,",
    "the field is highly irregular , producing in general a reorganization of the flow . to simplify the terminology",
    "we will say that the intermittent events separate _",
    "states with stationary properties _ ( swsp ) of the system .",
    "we note that the statistical perspective on the intermittency is mainly observational or attempts to characterize the statistical properties ( spectrum , scaling lows of the correlations ) on the basis of the general properties of the dynamical equations , like symmetry and conservation .    as an alternative to the statistical approach we propose in this paper a general model for the intermittency , regarded as a dynamical process leading to fast and significant changes in the fluctuating field .",
    "we take as the essential characteristic of the intermittency the events consisting of passages between states with stationary properties of the system . in many cases",
    "it can be recognized , for ideal systems , a swsp as a family of configurations with the same topology .",
    "consider for example a number of vortices moving in an ideal fluid . because the fluid is ideal it is not possible to go from one topological configuration ( for exemple @xmath0 vortices ) to a different one ( @xmath1 vortices ) since the passage requires breaking and reconnection  of the flow lines which in turn depends on the presence of resistivity ( in general , of dissipation ) . in real space - time",
    "these transitions are not allowed and the ideal system is constrained to evolve inside a family of topologically equivalent states , what we have defined as a regime of swsp . but even for the ideal system ,",
    "if the space - time is adequately extended it may be possible , under certain conditions , that the transitions can be realized .",
    "the passage taking place in an extended space - time between configurations with distinct topological content will be called _ instanton _ , in analogy with the instantons connecting states of degenerate vacua in field theory .",
    "compared to the ideal case , the evolution of the _ weakly dissipative _ system consists of motions which are homotopically equivalent and , from time to time , transitions between distinct configurations , the transitions being only allowed due to the presence of the dissipation .",
    "the essential idea of the model we propose is that these dissipative transitions are not arbitrary : these transitions evolve in a way which is the manifestation in real space - time of the instantons connecting topologically distinct configurations in the extended space - time .",
    "these transitions in real space - time are only possible if it exists for the particular system a topological structure in which are embedded both the initial and the final real space configurations .",
    "many numerical studies have been done for systems exhibiting intermittency in the form of burst - like events .",
    "it has been found that there is a connection between the positions of these events on the time axis and the positions of the singularities of the solution in the complex time plane .",
    "this has first been shown by frisch and morf @xcite in a study of a nonlinear differential equation for the variable ( velocity ) @xmath2 in the presence of damping @xmath3 and random drive @xmath4 : @xmath5 the numerical results show that the singularity is located above the burst event and that the amplitude is larger when the singularity is closer to the real time axis .",
    "the connection has been investigated using the fourier representation of the solution .",
    "this study presented a certain ressemblence with the problem of integrability of second - order ordinary differential equation , which has been formulated by painlev in the form of a precise criterion : a second order differential equation is _ integrable _ if the only movable singularities of the solution , in the complex plane of the variable ( _ e.g. _ time ) , are poles .",
    "the analogy between the intermittency / singularity and integrability / singularity problems has inspired a considerable effort of characterizing by numerical methods the nature and the position in the complex plane of the singularities , eventually leading to the extension of the painlev criterion to larger classes of equations .",
    "part of these studies have been devoted to understanding chaos ( via melnikov integral ) as opposed to the integrability .",
    "more connected with the problem of intermittency are the numerical studies of the following system @xcite @xcite : @xmath6 by numerical integration the position in the complex plane of the singularities , denoted @xmath7 , has been obtained . in bassetti _",
    "_ @xcite the fourier representation has been used to express the function @xmath8 by its singularities closest to the real time axis : @xmath9 and a graph of @xmath10 is obtained numerically .    from the perspective explained above we have to see the two minima of the potential in eq.([bassetti ] ) as topologically distinct states @xcite .",
    "the transition between these minima is forbidden for a classical particle , in the absence of negative dissipation ( _ i.e. _ contact with a thermal bath ) .",
    "but in an extension of the space - time ( here simply : _ imaginary time _ ) there are _ instantons _ ( or topological solitons ) connecting the two states . in this particular case",
    "we can precisely identify them , since the equation describes a @xmath11 theory and the solution is ( @xmath12 is the velocity and @xmath13 is the initial time ) @xmath14\\ ] ] this _ kink _ is an instanton connecting the state @xmath15 at @xmath16 with @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "we take @xmath19 and @xmath20 and note that the @xmath21 has singularities when the argument is @xmath22 , @xmath23 . using the approximation @xmath24 we find the imaginary part @xmath25 of the position in the complex @xmath26 plane of the singularity : @xmath27 this formula reproduces the fig.2 of bassetti _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "we have an example where the knowledge of the instanton explains the connection between complex singularities and the intermittent bursts .",
    "we formulate once more the basic idea @xcite @xcite : the burst - like intermittency is a real - space / time manifestation of an instanton transition between topologically distinct configurations generalizing states with stationary properties ( swsp ) .",
    "the projection on real - space / time is only allowed in the presence of dissipation .",
    "this is nothing but a _ conjecture _ and we have to gather solid arguments to support it .",
    "however this idea already suggests a series of steps to be taken in examining the model of an intermittent system .    1",
    ".   first , we have to find an ideal version of the system , _",
    "e.g. _ by supressing the dissipation part .",
    "actually this is often invoked in the examination of the onset of chaos in systems weakly perturbed around integrability .",
    "2 .   then the _ ideal _ model which is closest to the real one must be examined for identifying the distinct topological classes to which the solutions belong .",
    "next we have to extend the system : not only the space - time must be extended ( to larger dimensionality and/or complex variables ) but the equation of the model must be embedded into a larger system ( _ e.g. _ the simple pendulum equation is reduced from a self - dual yang - mills model ) .",
    "4 .   in this extended theory",
    "one should look for instantons connecting configurations of distinct topological classes .",
    "the existence of these solutions is the exclusive condition for the possibility of real space / time intermittency .",
    "one should be able to find also the nature of singularities of these instantons , whose signature could still be identifiable after returning to the original real - space / time system .",
    "this will help to localize the bursts by their relation with the extended space / time singularities .",
    "the extension of the theory and of the space - time means the inclusion of the theory into a much larger context . for the ideal system",
    "it is necessary to represent its swsp as states with nontrivial topological content .",
    "the instantons are transitions from one topological ( swsp ) state to another .",
    "in general one should expect that in arbitrary extension of the theory instantons do not exist , due to topological constraints .",
    "the instanton must be a solution of the extended system having as initial condition a configuration with a particular topology and as target a configuration with a different topology .",
    "most frequently , the initial and final configurations are sections of fibre bundles , as is the case for the @xmath28 model . connecting two configurations",
    "first requires to embed both homotopy classes to which belong the two sections into one single object .    of particular importance is to correctly infer the extended theory whose equation must reduce to the original ones when we return to the real space - time",
    "there is however a series of deep connections that have been revealed in recent years between classical integrable or topological differential equations and the self - dual yang - mills ( sdym ) field theory . reducing equations from sdym",
    "has been done for many well known differential equations , as will be discussed bellow . on the other hand",
    "there are precise situations where the construction of instantons as geometric - algebraic objects can be done systematically , using twistor theory .",
    "while these instruments are very useful in investigating the conjecture , they do not automatically lead to successful determination of the extended theory .",
    "the requirement to enlarge the theoretical framework of the _ ideal _ version of the system to a more complex theory can be formulated conversely : the ideal system should result by reduction from a more general theory where instantons can be found connecting the states of distinct topology .",
    "there is a large number of ideal systems with exceptional integrability properties , which can be derived by reduction from the self - dual yang - mills theory . for eaxample the integrable hierarchies@xcite ( kdv , nonlinear schrodinger equation , _",
    "sine_-gordon , etc . ) , the painlev transcendents@xcite , etc .",
    "the self duality equations have solutions with nontrivial topology inherited from the structure of fibre bundle defined by the base space and the group of automorphism of the typical fibre , most frequently ( for principal fibre bundles ) the algebra of symmetry group . self duality ( equality of the curvature two form with its hodge dual ) provides nonzero chern class .",
    "it is in this framework that the first examples of instantons ( in particular the t hooft - polyakov instanton ) have been found .",
    "we shall see bellow that one can construct instantons as riemann surfaces , at least for simple topology of the swsp configurations .",
    "the simplest example of topological nontrivial state is represented by a closed line on a torus surface .",
    "it is specified by two integer numbers @xmath29 which means that @xmath30 turns must be made in the toroidal direction and respectively @xmath0 in the poloidal direction for the line to close in itself . any homotopic deformation preserves @xmath31 .",
    "a line with a different pair @xmath32 can not be deformed into the first one , _",
    "i.e. _ the homotopy classes are labeled by the two integers .",
    "there are homotopic deformations which makes that a line from one family becomes close on a finite space region to a deformed line belonging to other family .",
    "then the presence of dissipation can allow for reconnection , which produces a transition of the line from one family to another .",
    "this occurs in real space - time . according to the _ conjecture",
    "_ , this transition is the manifestation in real space - time of the existence of a solution connecting in extended space - time solutions belonging to the two families .",
    "we have to look for this _ _ super__solution .    to examine this example",
    "we simplify taking @xmath33 .",
    "any solution represents a section in a fibred space whose base space is the circle ( the axis of the torus ) and the space of internal symmetry ( the fibre ) is also a circle ( a phase variable , represented by an arrow from the current point on basis to a point of a circle , here the poloidal section ) . a configuration ( helical line ) is a map @xmath34 charaterized by an integer number @xmath0 representing the degree of the map .",
    "this means how many times a circle covers a circle , or , how many times the internal - space phase variable @xmath35 varies between @xmath36 and @xmath37 for a single turn along the circle representing the base space .     with two topological degrees , @xmath38 ( left ) and @xmath39 ( right ) , title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] with two topological degrees , @xmath38 ( left ) and @xmath39 ( right ) , title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]",
    "we will look for configurations allowing a transition between a line with ( for example ) @xmath40 to another line with @xmath41 .",
    "first the model is extended to one where the homotopical deformations are given by the time dynamics , a much more complex problem , where the simple lines represent the instantaneous positions of the masses of a chain of pendul .",
    "this is the sinegordon equation .",
    "when we start from an ideal system ( like korteweg - devries , _",
    "sine_-gordon , nonlinear schrodinger , painlev transcendents , etc . ) and try to look at it as a reduced form of a larger and more complex system , it systematically appears the self - dual yang - mills system .",
    "it has been proved that all the equations mentioned above are reduced forms of the sdym equations .",
    "the derivation consists of several steps :    * definition of the space - time ; for the painlev transcendents this is the complexified four dimensional space @xmath42with metric @xmath43 . * the fibre bundle structure , where the basis is the space - time and the fibre is a vector space with the group of automorphism @xmath44 .",
    "the gauge potential is a connection one - form and the self - duality expresses the equality of the curvature two - form with its hodge dual . * imposing the invariance to a group of symmetries .",
    "the generators of the algebra of the symmetry group are constructed using the normal form of the matrix that combines the basis vector fields in the projective coordinates . *",
    "the connection one - form is contracted with these generators and particular expressions are obtained . requiring self - duality",
    "generates the nonlinear equations    the abstract procedure can be expressed in the language of twistors .    after finding that the idealized form of the initial system can be seen as a reduced form of the sdym system",
    ", we can look for a sufficiently general framework for the sdym : larger dimensionality , larger symmetry group , etc . the aim is to reach the form of the theory where the solution connecting the two topological structures is available . in this idea",
    ", the extension of the sdym system to the hitchin system will prove to be essential for identifing the passage between the two @xmath45 states characterized by different topological degrees @xmath0 as the riemann surface representing interaction of two strings .",
    "looking for systematic methods to construct instantons connecting configurations with different topologies , we must start with the cases where the initial and final states have the simplest nontrivial homology .",
    "these are essentially the classes of states of a system representing the mapping @xmath46 @xmath47 whose first homotopy group is @xmath48 .",
    "such a system is the _",
    "sine_-gordon equation .",
    "the states are classified by the integer @xmath0 and we ask how to connect , for example , a state @xmath0 with a state @xmath1 .",
    "we can find a suggestive algebraic - geometric construction in the _ matrix theory_.    in general terms the matrix theory is the non - perturbative description of the @xmath49-theory which , in turn , is the @xmath50-dimensional theory of the strong coupling limit of type @xmath51 strings .",
    "the string theory can be obtained from the @xmath49-theory by compactification on a circle and identifying the string coupling constant with the radius of this circle . by compactification",
    "it results a supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) which describes non - perturbatively the type @xmath51 strings .",
    "the duality of these theories ( strings and sym ) is underlined by the relation between their coupling constants @xmath52 and means that examining the strong coupling limit of sym we get the weakly interacting , _",
    "i.e. _ perturbative , limit of the string theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the deep infrared limit ( equivalent to strong coupling in sym ) is a theory describing strings propagating freely .",
    "the supersymmetric yang - mills theory offers two models equally interesting for their topological properties . in the absence of interaction ( a phase with",
    "completely broken @xmath53 symmetry ) , the strings are multiply wound along the compact dimension of the cylindrical base space .",
    "when a weak interaction is allowed we have separation and connection of strings . at this point",
    "a riemann surface is introduced and this is the construction we want to examine . however , in order to reach that point we have to say few words about the _ matrix _ theory .",
