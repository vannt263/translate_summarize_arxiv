    "in the last few years spin systems consisting of a finite number @xmath2 of interacting spin chains with @xmath3 ( now usually called spin ladders , consisting of legs and rungs , see fig .  [ ladder ] for @xmath4 ) have attracted considerable attention as recently reviewed by dagotto and rice @xcite . > from the theoretical point of view , these systems are intermediate between one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "interest in these systems started with the two leg ladder @xcite with isotropic antiferromagnetic couplings on the legs and rungs ; in contrast to the @xmath5chain this ladder is characterized by a spin gap .",
    "the appearance of this gap is immediately clear in the limit of strong ferromagnetic interactions on the rungs ( it then is identical to the gap characterizing the @xmath1 antiferromagnetic ( haldane ) chain ) and in the limit of interactions on the rungs only ( dimer limit ) ; the gap , however , apparently persists not only for the isotropic antiferromagnetic ladder @xcite but for nearly all values of the coupling constants except in the limiting case of two decoupled chains . in more recent investigations , af ladders with @xmath2 legs have been shown to behave as spin liquids for @xmath2 odd and as gapped systems for @xmath2 even @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations have been performed on the @xmath4 ladder substance @xmath6 @xcite and also on the family of compounds @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) @xcite which approximately realize ladders with @xmath9 legs . in these materials evidence for the existence of a spin gap has been found in susceptibility @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite and magnetic resonance @xcite experiments .",
    "the cuprates are of additional interest as candidates for high temperature superconductivity , which , however , remains undetected @xcite .",
    "these experimental results have been successfully dealt with in a large number of theoretical approaches using e.g. perturbation theory and exact numerical diagonalization @xcite , mean field theory based on bond operators @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "recently theoretical interest in spin ladder models with @xmath4 has concentrated on the fact that these models allow to interpolate smoothly between seemingly very different spin systems when the rung coupling is varied , such as between the @xmath1 antiferromagnetic ( haldane ) chain and the dimer state , i.e. models which are built of triplets , resp .",
    "singlets on the rungs @xcite .",
    "an interpolation between these two limiting models which avoids the singular point of two decoupled legs is possible when an additional interaction on one of the diagonal bonds is introduced as proposed by white @xcite and chitra et al @xcite .",
    "this model is defined by the following hamiltonian ( see fig .  [ ladder ] ) :    @xmath10    @xmath11    periodic boundary conditions are used and operators @xmath12 denote spin1/2 operators with the indices @xmath13 labeling the two legs and @xmath14 labeling the @xmath15 rungs . when sites are labeled by a single index ( running from 1 to @xmath16 as also indicated in fig .  [ ladder ] ) it becomes clear that the spin ladder with additional diagonal couplings is a generalized model composed of the spin1/2 chains with bond alternation and next nearest neighbour ( nnn ) interaction .",
    "this model includes in particular ( compare with fig .  [ phasediag ] ) :    * the antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath3 heisenberg chain with nnn exchange of relative strength @xmath17 ( @xmath18-axis , @xmath19 ) ) , including in particular the majumdar - ghosh ( mg ) limit @xcite ( @xmath20 ) with two degenerate dimerized exact groundstates given as a product of singlets either on the rungs or on the diagonals , * the af @xmath3 heisenberg chain with alternating exchange ( @xmath21axis , @xmath22 ) , including in particular the dimerized chain ( @xmath23 ) with couplings on the rungs only and a product of singlets on the rungs as exact ground state , * the  regular  isotropic @xmath3 ladder for @xmath24 ; the experimentally relevant cases mentioned above are expected to correspond to @xmath25 , i.e.to coupling of equal strength on the rungs and on the legs , * the haldane chain with @xmath15 sites for @xmath26 , @xmath27 and nondiverging ( leading to @xmath1 units with an effective af coupling @xmath28 on the diagonals ) , * the isotropic @xmath29 af heisenberg chain with @xmath16 sites ( for @xmath30 ) and two decoupled af heisenberg chains with @xmath15 sites each ( for @xmath31 with @xmath21 finite ) .    in addition the following lines in the phase diagram are of particular interest :    * the line ( a ) , @xmath32 , is of particular interest since on this line a transition from the gapless isotropic af heisenberg chain to the gapped mg chain occurs with increasing nnn coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "this transition has been investigated in detail @xcite ( for a review see ref . ) and the critical point has recently been located very accurately at @xmath33 @xcite",
    ". line ( a ) and its immediate neighbourhood ( @xmath34 ) is also of experimental relevance because of the discovery of the spin - peierls compound @xmath35 with alternating and strong nnn interactions @xcite ; * the straight line ( b ) , which connects the dimer point to the mg point ( @xmath36 ) ; on this line one of the mg ground states , the state with singlets on the rungs remains an exact ground state @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the properties of the generalized spin ladder in the space spanned by the interaction constants @xmath27 and @xmath21 .",
    "first we note that there is a symmetry transformation connecting the upper half - plane of the phase space of fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] to the strip @xmath37 : a translation of the upper leg by one lattice constant to the left leads to a ladder with the same symmetry , but different coupling constants .",
    "the symmetry transformation exchanges the roles of rungs and diagonals ; apart from a change in energy scale by a factor @xmath38 ( which is qualitatively irrelevant for @xmath39 ) , it is expressed in the following way in terms of the parameters of the hamiltonian :    @xmath40    the symmetry line of this transformation is the @xmath41axis @xmath19 , points on this axis are mapped onto themselves .",
    "owing to the presence of this symmetry we will consider in the following the region @xmath42 of the @xmath43plane only .",
    "the strip @xmath37 is related to the upper half - plane by the symmetry of eq.([transf ] ) , the section @xmath39 of the @xmath44plane has af coupling and is identical to the phase space discussed by shastry and sutherland @xcite . including the region @xmath45 adds the possibility of ferromagnetic coupling between the two legs , this possibility has so far been discussed for special cases only @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will present results for the generalized spin ladder as defined by the hamiltonian of eq.([hami ] ) from a variational approach based on the concept of hidden order .",
    "these results will be supplemented by and compared to the results from exact diagonalizations for finite ladders with up to 14 rungs .",
    "the question of hidden order in generalized spin ladders comes up naturally since the af @xmath1 chain , the prototype system where hidden order has emerged first , is realized in the limit @xmath46 . in the haldane chain @xcite hidden order has been made transparent by kennedy and tasaki @xcite , using a nonlocal unitary transformation .",
    "ground states with complete hidden order were then written down in the form of matrix product ( mp ) ground states @xcite and used as basis for variational calculations .",
    "the new feature of ladders is that singlets on the rungs get mixed in when one moves from the haldane limit @xmath46 towards finite values of @xmath21 .",
    "a generalization of the kennedy - tasaki - transformation @xcite was proposed by takada and watanabe @xcite for the isotropic spin ladder ( @xmath47 , varying @xmath18 ) .",
    "explicit definitions of hidden order in spin ladders were recently discussed by nishiyama et al @xcite and white @xcite .",
    "our variational approach starts from the observation that the two exact ground states of the majumdar - ghosh hamiltonian can be written in the form of matrix product states .",
    "we then generalize the matrix product state to allow the ansatz to include the approximate ground state of the haldane chain as given by affleck et al @xcite and written as matrix product state by klmper et al @xcite .",
    "continuous variation of the parameters then smoothly connects the seemingly unrelated limiting cases of the majumdar - ghosh and dimer points on the one hand and of the haldane chain on the other hand .",
    "we expect this ansatz to make sense as a frame for a qualitative description in a large part of the half plane @xmath27 .",
    "in section 2 we will introduce the variational matrix product states defining the hidden order in the analogous way as for an s=1 chain but replacing the contribution of the @xmath48 component of the rung triplet state by a linear combination of this component with the rung singlet .",
    "the exactly known ground states of the majumdar - ghosh chain are particular examples of this ansatz .",
    "this definition of matrix product states imposes a particular type of hidden order which we will describe . in section 3",
    "we present the results of variational calculations for the ground state energy and for ground state correlation functions obtained by using this scheme .",
    "in addition the string correlation function as proposed in ref . will be computed . in section 4",
    "we present numerical results for the ground state energy and the gap along various paths in the phase diagram ( shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) .",
    "these results are obtained from exact diagonalization of finite ladders with up to 14 rungs and periodic boundary conditions using the lanczos algorithm ; they will be discussed in comparison to the results of the variational calculations .",
    "our results imply that a smooth variation of parameters leads one from the haldane - phase to the dimer - phase ; they therefore support the hypothesis that these two limiting models are not separated by a phase transition and that the only critical behaviour in the phase diagram considered is on the gapless line @xmath49 .",
    "special attention will be paid to the neighborhood of this line in the numerical calculations .",
    "conclusions will be given in section 5 .",
    "we start by a discussion of the majumdar - ghosh chain , i.e. @xmath50 . for periodic boundary conditions the two ground states are known exactly : they are dimerized configurations with singlets on either the rungs , @xmath51 , or the diagonal bonds , @xmath52 .",
    "if we use the following representation of states on the j - th rung ,    @xmath53    the two ground states can be writen in form of mp - states    @xmath54    with the matrices @xmath55 defined by    @xmath56    in the representation of eq.([orderst ] ) both mg ground states are given in terms of singlets resp .",
    "triplets on the _ rungs _ ; this appears complicated for the state @xmath57",
    "but actually it serves to realize the presence of hidden order in the mg ground states : the matrix representation of the ground state according to eqs.([orderst],[mgmatrix ] ) has components of the following string structure only    @xmath58    i.e. the sequence @xmath59 is interrupted either by an arbitrary number of sites with @xmath60 following a site with @xmath61 or by an arbitrary number of sites with @xmath62 following a site with @xmath63 .",
    "the symmetry transformation of eq.([transf ] ) transforms the ladder into itself on the line @xmath19 and the two states @xmath64 and @xmath57 remain degenerate for @xmath65 ; they are , however , ground states only at the majumdar - ghosh point . when moving off the axis @xmath66 this symmetry",
    "is destroyed and at most one of these states survives as ground state . in particular , on the line ( b ) ,",
    "@xmath36 the ground state is @xmath67 , i.e. composed of rung singlets .",
    "this disorder line is therefore characterized by a vanishing of the correlation length . under the symmetry transformation ( [ transf ] ) this line ( b ) transforms into the line ( b ) @xmath68 ) with a dimerized ground state with singlets located on diagonal bonds . as discussed in the introduction",
    "it is sufficient to discuss only the region @xmath42 in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "when we move away from the mg point , the state @xmath67 has no freedom to adapt but the state @xmath57 can be used as the basis for a variational calculation by allowing different amplitudes for the singlet and the triplet contributions .",
    "rotational invariance requires the following form for the matrix @xmath55    @xmath69    this follows from the fact that the three states    @xmath70    form a vector and can only appear in the @xmath71 matrix @xmath55 in the combination @xmath72 in the case of rotational invariance ( @xmath73 are the pauli spin matrices ) . in eq.([wavefunction ] ) , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are complex variational parameters , subject to the normalization condition @xmath76 .",
    "thus the parameters entering the variational calculation are one amplitude and one phase .",
    "the ansatz of eq.([wavefunction ] ) can be shown to reduce to the state introduced by takada and watanabe @xcite when their state is written in original spin space ( no unitary transformation ) and perfect generalized hidden order is introduced .",
    "if we put @xmath77 in eq.([wavefunction ] ) we obtain the aklt state @xcite , the exact ground state of the af @xmath1 chain with biquadratic exchange of strength @xmath78 .",
    "it has to be noticed that the variational ansatz of eq.([wavefunction ] ) may be used with the matrices @xmath55 defined either on the rungs or on the diagonals and as a first step of the variational calculation it is necessary to find out which of these possibilities leads to lower energy .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath42 ( which is the region we will consider ) lower energy is obtained when @xmath55 is defined on the diagonals , whereas defining @xmath55 on rungs gives the lower energy for @xmath79 . on the symmetry line @xmath19 eq.([wavefunction ] ) is an approximate description of the two equivalent groundstates for @xmath80 .",
    "the ansatz of eq.([wavefunction ] ) allows to reproduce the exact ground state on line ( b ) ( @xmath81 ) , the variational approach is therefore exact on this line .    on the one hand ,",
    "the wave function of eq.([wavefunction ] ) is rather general since it can smoothly interpolate between dimerized states and aklt - states , i.e.  states which correspond to points which are far separated in the phase diagram . on the other hand one can not expect this approach to work for the whole @xmath18@xmath21plane since it is manifestly inadequate for special points like the ones corresponding to the haf or to two decoupled chains , which have gapless spectra and power - law decay of correlations functions",
    "we finally note that there is another possibility of constructing a rotationally invariant wave function of the mp type which is related to the resonating valence bond structure also discussed for spin ladders : a mp wavefunction with the following alternating structure    @xmath82    i.e.  the previous structure with diagonal elements interchanged in every second g - matrix , describes a state with singlets located on the legs .",
    "thus our ansatz is also connected to rvb states on ladders as introduced in refs ..",
    "in this section we present the calculation of the energy , of the spin correlation function and of the string ( hidden order ) correlation function using the variational state of eq.([wavefunction ] ) .",
    "we discuss results for these quantities in the @xmath44plane and compare to the results of alternative approximate approaches for special points . a comparison to the results of numerical calculations",
    "will be given in section 4 .",
    "the calculation of the ground state energy and of the ground state correlation functions can be done in complete analogy to the corresponding calculations for the @xmath1 af chain @xcite .",
    "the variational energy , i.e.  the expectation value of the hamiltonian of eq.([hami ] ) with the wavefunction of eq.([wavefunction ] ) and the matrix @xmath55 defined on diagonal bonds , is obtained as    @xmath83    with the norm @xmath84 as an additional constraint .",
    "@xmath85 is the relative phase of the original complex amplitudes @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath86 reduces to the expression given by watanabe @xcite for @xmath24 and to the expression given by takada and watanabe @xcite for @xmath87 for perfect generalized hidden order .",
    "the procedure of minimizing @xmath86 is performed easiest by first minimizing with respect to @xmath88 and then with respect to the ratio @xmath89 .",
    "the analysis shows that the absolute minimum always corresponds to @xmath90 , and the amplitudes @xmath74 and @xmath75 can always be taken real ; the remaining equation for @xmath91 is of third order .",
    "thus the minimum can be calculated exactly for general values of @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "the simple variational wave function of eq.([wavefunction ] ) also allows the calculation of the ground state correlation functions .",
    "they exhibit the exponential decay characteristic for mp states . owing to isotropy",
    "there is only one correlation length which is obtained as    @xmath92    in order to discuss the hidden order for the ladder system , we use the definition given in ref . , which reproduces the known results in the @xmath93chain limit .",
    "using this definition , we obtain the following result for the string correlation function ( in the thermodynamic limit @xmath94 )    @xmath95    in fig .",
    "[ symmetryline ] we show results obtained from the mp state ansatz for points on the lines @xmath96 . in the mg - case ( @xmath97 ) and at the dimer point",
    "the variational ground state is exact , we have @xmath98 .",
    "the wavefunction is identical to that of eqs.([orderst],[mgmatrix ] ) , one of the two exact mg ground state wavefunctions with energy @xmath99 .",
    "the correlation lengths @xmath100 vanish .",
    "[ symmetryline](a , b ) show the ground state energy and the correlation length on the lines @xmath101 . discussing our results on the line",
    "@xmath19 i.e.  for the general af chain with nnn interactions , we have to restrict the discussion to the range @xmath102 since the mp ansatz is no more appropriate when the gapless system is approached .",
    "nevertheless we note that the variational ground state energy for @xmath103 is @xmath104 , i.e.  within 1% of the exact value @xcite . in the region to the right of the disorder line the relative error increases to typically 5% .",
    "the correlation lengths remain very small as is typical for mp wave functions .",
    "the string order parameter is determined by the singlet weight @xmath105 which is shown in fig.[symmetryline]c , we have @xmath106 to the left and @xmath107 to the right of the disorder line ( b ) .",
    "the string order parameter for the two degenerate mg states takes the values @xmath108 ( obtained from @xmath109 ) .",
    "the fact that the string correlation is different for the two equivalent ground states is related to the asymmetric definition of the string correlation with respect to rungs and diagonals in eq.([string ] ) .    for the symmetry line @xmath19 , another variational wavefunction of rvb type ( which is also exact at the mg point ) was proposed by zen and parkinson @xcite . when the results for the ground state energy are compared for these two approaches , for @xmath110",
    "lower energies are found from the rvb approach and for @xmath111 from the present mp state approach .",
    "the correlation length for @xmath110 is similar in the rvb and the mp state approaches , wheras for @xmath112 the mp ansatz results in a larger increase in @xmath113 .",
    "the behaviour of the correlation lengths in this region of the phase diagram might be influenced by the possible emergence of a spatially modulated ground state ( spiral phase ) at @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the mp state ansatz can not by construction reproduce such a behaviour and the alternating ansatz as described above in eq.([alternate ] ) does not lead to lower variational energies either ( except for large values of @xmath18 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this aspect will be given when we discuss our numerical results in section 4 .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of results for the regular ladder system @xmath115 . from the variational approach we obtain @xmath116 and @xmath117 for this isotropic ladder .",
    "these results may be compared to those for a variational rvb wave function which was proposed by fan and ma @xcite and leads to a ground state energy of @xmath118 and a correlation length of @xmath119 .",
    "the difference between the two variational energies of about 1% appears negligible when it is compared to the exact ( numerical ) result @xmath120 .",
    "both variational methods lead to correlation lengths considerably smaller than @xmath121 as computed in ref .. this is consistent with the well - known fact that in approaches using mp states the correlation length is notoriously underestimated ( compare the aklt value of @xmath122 to the exact correlation length @xmath123 in the af @xmath1 chain ) .",
    "finally we want to illustrate in the set of figs .",
    "[ figsing](a - c ) how the limit of an antiferromagnetic @xmath1 chain is included in the present scheme for @xmath124 . in this limit",
    "it is very unfavorable to have singlets on the diagonal bonds , so minimization leads to @xmath125 .",
    "we show the ground state energy and the singlet weight with increasing @xmath126 for @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ figsing](a ) and in fig .",
    "[ figsing](c ) respectively . combining these graphs with the corresponding ones from fig .",
    "[ symmetryline ] we can follow a continuous path from the dimer point to the haldane limit . the smooth variation of the physical quantities on such a path illustrates the similarity of the haldane phase and the dimer phase in the present approach .",
    "the minimum of the variational energy in the limit appropriate for the af @xmath93 chain has the following form    @xmath127    the first term in @xmath128 is just the internal energy of the triplets representing the internal energy of spins @xmath1 at the @xmath15 sites .",
    "we see that minimization in the limit of infinite negative @xmath21 leads to the aklt - state with    @xmath129    this is the identical result as obtained from direct variational calculations for the @xmath1 chain @xcite .    for the @xmath93chain the hidden order",
    "is characterized by the string order parameter as introduced in ref . .",
    "in our approach , the aklt value @xmath130 is reproduced in the limit of zero singlet weight , i.e.  for @xmath131 . as is seen from the monotonic behaviour of the singlet weight in fig .",
    "[ figsing](c ) in combination with eq.([string ] ) , the string order parameter @xmath132 decreases monotonically when @xmath21 is increased from @xmath133 towards @xmath134 .",
    "we have computed the ground state energy per rung and the energy gap for different values of the nnn interaction @xmath18 and the alternating bond exchange @xmath21 in order to compare these exact results to those obtained in the variational calculation of the last section in the various regions of the phase diagram . the paths which we have investigated",
    "numerically are shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] as dashed lines .",
    "the results for points in the upper half plane follow from the symmetry property given in eq.([transf ] ) .",
    "numerical calculations were done on the mpp cray t3d sc256 of the zuse computing center berlin .",
    "we used the lanczos technique to determine the ground state energy _ per rung _ as well as the singlet - triplet energy gap on @xmath135 lattices for @xmath136 . in order to extrapolate the results for finite @xmath15 to the bulk limit we used the ansatz of ref . ,    @xmath137    i.e.  a power law in @xmath15 multiplied by an exponential .",
    "following ref .",
    "the lanczos data were fitted using @xmath138 for the ground state energy per rung and @xmath139 for the gap energy .",
    "the typical relative mean square error of these fits was about @xmath140 for the ground state energy and about @xmath141 for the gap energy .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath142 reflects the characteristic length of the system and corresponds to the correlation length in the chain under consideration .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of our program by recalculating data for the isotropic ladder ( @xmath143 ) and have fully reproduced the results of ref ..    in our numerical calculations we have concentrated on two different aspects of generalized spin ladders :    * on the variation of the ground state energy and of the excitation gap when we move from the dimer state to the haldane limit .",
    "these data allow to estimate quantitatively the accuracy of the variational approach based on mp states and to discuss the issue whether these two limiting states are separated by a phase boundary .",
    "* on the neighbourhood of the gapless line ( a ) connecting the two conformal points @xmath144 ( hafm ) and @xmath145 .",

    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "our numerical results for various chain lengths and their extrapolation to the bulk limit are given in tables  [ tone ] and [ ttwo ] and displayed in figs .",

    "both numbers are in excellent agreement with the well - known results for the ground state energy and the gap of the haldane chain @xcite .",
    "the analogous extrapolation for the characteristic length @xmath142 ( see eq.([fit ] ) ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsing](d ) ; @xmath142 increases monotonically when we approach the haldane limit on our path .",

    "the numerical results are in agreement with the observation already made for the variational results : on the continuous path through the phase diagram the quantities @xmath152 vary smoothly and there is no indication of a phase boundary in the variation of these quantities .",
    "these data therefore support the hypothesis that the dimer point , the majumdar - ghosh point and the haldane limit all are in the same phase .",
    "the gap characterizing these three limiting chains as well as the intermediate systems , including the regular spin ladder thus appears only quantitatively different and these systems therefore should be considered as manifestation of basically the same quantum condensation phenomenon .",
    "we now turn to the second region of interest in the phase diagram , the area around the line of vanishing gap connecting the two known conformal points .",

    "the minimum is found at finite wavevector , @xmath183 , although dispersion is very weak and it is not clear whether the minimum at finite wavevector will survive an appropriate extrapolation to the infinite system .",
    "actually , this result may be more accurate than one might expect from the small size of the system since we found in the finite size extrapolations for @xmath184 that the results for the finite @xmath179 site system differ very little ( relative difference @xmath185 ) from the thermodynamic limit . for a full understanding more",
    "calculations are clearly required .",
    "we have investigated the phase diagram of a generalized spin ladder with additional interaction on diagonal bonds .",
    "this model includes several known cases , in particular the @xmath1 chain in the haldane phase and the dimer and majumdar - ghosh chains belonging to a dimerized phase .",
    "this generalized spin ladder was studied with a variational wave ansatz and numerical techniques . using the concept of hidden order throughout the whole phase diagram ( with the exception of the line of gapless points ) ,",
    "a rotationally invariant matrix - product state was proposed for the ground state of these ladders .",
    "the ground state energy , and spin and string correlations were calculated .",
    "the comparison with numerical results for the ground state energies leads to agreement typically within about 4 - 5% , consistent with the qualitative nature of our approximation . in the @xmath1 chain limit",
    "the well known aklt state and the variational energy of 4/3 per site are reproduced and extrapolation of the numerical results leads to excellent agreement with the known values for the ground state energy and the gap of the haldane chain .",
    "a string correlation function was chosen such as to reproduce in the corresponding limit the aklt value of 4/9 for the factorizing approximation to the @xmath1 chain .",
    "this string correlation function is directly related to the singlet weight in the mp wave function and decreases monotonically when one moves from the haldane limit towards dimerized states .",
    "> from both the numerical and the variational calculations we find on paths connecting the dimer and majumdar - ghosh points to the haldane limit smooth variations of all quantities considered .",
    "we are therefore lead to conclude that these dimerized af @xmath3 chains and the af @xmath1 chain are in the same phase and that the gap in the excitation spectrum of these chains is of the same nature . on the other hand , our numerical data for the excitation spectrum close to the line connecting the dimer and",
    "the mg points show a shift of the wavevector of the minimum excitation energy from @xmath166 to @xmath186 as well as an indication that the minimum may be found at intermediate wavevectors .",
    "thus the question of the existence of a spiral phase remains unresolved and requires further investigation .",
    "using the present approach elementary excitations can be constructed as soliton - like states as for dimer - like systems @xcite and for the @xmath1 chain @xcite .",
    "our approach can also be extended to include anisotropic couplings ; in particular , similar as in the af @xmath1 chain , there should be a critical value for the ising - like anisotropy on the legs , at which the system exhibits long range order even for @xmath187 .",
    "these further applications of the mp approach are now under investigation .",
