    "given a finite simple graph @xmath4 , a * valuation * is a real - valued map @xmath22 on the set of subgraphs of @xmath4 , so that @xmath37 holds for any two subgraphs @xmath7 of @xmath4 and @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 , if @xmath41 are finite simple graphs with vertex sets @xmath42 and edge sets @xmath43 . with the empty graph @xmath44 ,",
    "a graph with no vertices and no edges , the set of all subgraphs is a lattice .",
    "if one requires additionally that @xmath45 holds for any two isomorphic subgraphs @xmath7 of @xmath4 , then @xmath22 is called an * invariant valuation*. a * quadratic valuation * @xmath22 is a map which attaches to a pair @xmath7 of subgraphs of @xmath4 a real number @xmath46 such that for fixed @xmath47 , the map @xmath48 and for fixed @xmath49 the map @xmath50 are valuations and such that @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "it is an * intersection number * which extends to a bilinear form on the module of chains defined on the abstract whitney simplicial complex of the graph @xmath4 . + more generally , a * @xmath53-linear valuation * is a map which attaches to an ordered @xmath53-tuple of subgraphs @xmath54 of @xmath4 a real intersection number which is  multi - linear \" in the sense that any of the maps @xmath55 is a valuation .",
    "we also assume they are localized in the sense that @xmath56 is only possible only if @xmath57 . for a @xmath53-linear valuation @xmath22",
    "one obtains the self intersection number @xmath58 .",
    "we will see that some multi - linear valuations still honor the product property @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the product graph , the incidence graph of the product @xmath61 of the representations of @xmath7 in the stanley - reisner ring . when seen as integer - valued functions on this ring , valuations with this property are multiplicative functions .",
    "+    here are footnotes on the choice of the definitions",
    ". + ( i ) the terminology  linear valuation \" and  multi - linear valuation \" come from fact that the valuation property can be written as @xmath62 using the symmetric difference @xmath63 .",
    "but this addition throws us out of the category of graphs into the class of chains .",
    "valuations are in this larger ambient class compatible with the algebra . for graphs",
    ", we have to to stick to the lattice description when defining the valuation .",
    "an example : with the given definitions of union and intersection of graphs , the graphs @xmath64 and @xmath65 define @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the valuation property is satisfied , but with symmetric differences on vertices and edges we get @xmath68 which is only a chain and no more a graph .",
    "the absence of a linear algebra structure on the category of graphs is a reason for the complexity for computing valuations ( it is an np complete problem ) and the reason to stick with the * boolean distributive lattice * of subgraphs using union and intersection rather than symmetric difference and intersection which is not defined in the category of graphs .",
    "the usual graph complement is not compatible .",
    "also in the continuum , valuations use the lattice structure using that unions and intersections of convex sets rather than allowing complements of convex sets which would allow to build a * measure theory for valuations*. in the discrete , the difficulty is transparent : for a valuation , the complement of the graph @xmath69 within @xmath70 is only a chain @xmath71 which we call the virtual interior .",
    "it has the euler characteristic @xmath72 , which is the wu characteristic of @xmath73 .",
    "+ ( ii ) without the assumption @xmath38 , we would also count constant functions @xmath74 as valuation , but it is tradition not to include them . it would render the valuation *  affine \" * rather than  linear \" because linearity requires @xmath38 for the empty graph @xmath44 . + ( iii ) the invariance property is also a common assumption , both in the continuum and in the discrete . in the continuum case , where valuations are mainly studied on unions of * convex sets * in euclidean space , the invariance assumption is that the valuation is invariant under euclidean motion .",
    "the reason for assuming this is that the theory is already rich enough with that assumption and that it also also in the continuum leads to a finite dimensional space of valuations .",
    "flat euclidean space seems confining .",
    "this is however not the case as one can for the purpose of valuations , embed riemannian manifolds into euclidean or projective spaces .",
    "this induces a valuation theory on riemannian manifolds and beyond .",
    "more about this in the hadwiger appendix .",
    "+ ( iv ) the assumption @xmath75 if @xmath76 was done so that the theorems work . without it , much would fail .",
    "the assumption excludes cases like @xmath77 for two linear valuations @xmath78 .",
    "the assumption will imply that the curvatures and indices are localized as is the case in differential geometry .",
    "one could look at cubic valuations @xmath79 for which @xmath22 is only zero if the nerve graph defined by @xmath80 is not connected .",
    "widening the localization as such would make the curvature functions @xmath81 depend on a disk of radius @xmath53 , if @xmath22 is a @xmath53-linear valuation . with the assumption",
    ", the curvature functions always depend on a disk of radius @xmath82 .",
    "the assumption of insisting all simplices to intersect simultaneously ( as wu did ) implies that cubic and higher order characteristics agree with euler characteristic .",
    "otherwise , the boundary formula as well as the product property fails .",
    "we would also expect that getting rid of the localization assumption would lead to additional  connection terms \" due to chains which are not boundaries .",
    "an example of a non - invariant valuation is the map @xmath83 which assigns to a sub graph @xmath47 of @xmath4 the vertex degree of a fixed vertex within @xmath47 .",
    "when summing this valuations @xmath84 over all vertices @xmath14 , we get by the euler handshake formula the invariant valuation @xmath85 , counting twice the number of edges in @xmath47 . the euler handshake is already a gauss - bonnet formula adding up local quantities to get a global quantity .",
    "we see it now as adding up local valuations to a global valuation .",
    "the prototype of an invariant valuation is the * euler characteristic * of a graph @xmath4 .",

    "each @xmath88 is of course an invariant valuation . by gauss - bonnet",

    "the map @xmath92 is the * curvature * of @xmath47 at @xmath14 .",
    "it is generalized as it assigns to the empty graph the constant @xmath93 .",
    "any invariant valuation can be written as a sum of such local valuations using the curvature @xmath94 .",
    "this is gauss - bonnet for valuations .",
    "we rediscovered it in @xcite in the case of euler characteristic but the formula has been discovered and rediscovered before @xcite .",
    "it appears that we have entered new ground when extending gauss - bonnet to general linear valuations and especially to multi - linear valuations .",
    "it is important to note that gauss - bonnet holds for all finite simple graphs and any multi - linear valuation and no geometric assumptions whatsoever like being a discretization of a manifold are needed .",
    "the theorem holds for all networks .",
    "+ an example of a quadratic valuation is the * wu characteristic * @xcite given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 runs over all ordered pairs of complete subgraphs of @xmath47 .",

    "in the second equivalent formula for @xmath46 , the quadratic form @xmath101 counts the number of @xmath30-simplices in @xmath47 and @xmath31-simplices in @xmath49 with @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 be a one point graph for example , then @xmath104 is a linear valuation , but not an invariant valuation as it is local giving nonzero values only near the vertex @xmath14 .",
    "+ while the euler characteristic @xmath105 defines a linear map on the * @xmath18-vector * @xmath106 with @xmath107 counting the number of complete subgraphs @xmath108 of @xmath4 , the wu characteristic @xmath109 evaluates a * quadratic @xmath18-form * @xmath110 , where @xmath111 counts the number of complete subgraphs @xmath112 of @xmath4 which intersect in a non - empty graph .",

    "the quadratic form @xmath110 is not necessarily positive definite but always has a positive maximal eigenvalue by perron - frobenius .",
    "one can also look at cubic situations like @xmath116 where the behavior on complete graphs is @xmath117 again for all @xmath1 and @xmath118 holds for all @xmath1-graphs even if @xmath4 has a boundary .",

    "all these characteristics turn out to be invariant under barycentric refinement as well as have the multiplicative property and agree up to a sign with euler characteristic @xmath17 for @xmath1-graphs , graphs for which every unit sphere is a @xmath127-sphere .",

    "are as 2-spheres , the tetrahedron is a 3-dimensional simplex , has euler characteristic @xmath93 and is contractible .",
    "we can reformulate euler s result then that for a discrete 2-sphere @xmath4 , the euler characteristic is @xmath82 .",

    "this number is also interesting as it is hard to compute for general graphs , that it is the number of vertices of the barycentric refinement of @xmath4 or the value @xmath141 if @xmath142 is the stanley - reisner polynomial of @xmath4 .",
    "the smallest @xmath1-sphere is believed to be the sharp lower bound like @xmath143 attained for the @xmath144 graph , @xmath145 attained for the octahedron , @xmath146 for the 3-cross polytop or @xmath147 for the 4-cross polytop ; the reason is that @xmath148 for the smallest @xmath1-sphere . as the kalai valuation @xmath22 has the curvature @xmath149 which is always positive , one could try to use gauss - bonnet and induction , as @xmath150 implying @xmath151 .",

    "the kalai conjecture is already by definition verifiable in finitely many cases for each @xmath1 ( in principle ) but the just given argument reduces the verification range from @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    "the argument still gives inductively @xmath158 for any @xmath159 so that @xmath158 holds for any graph with clique number @xmath160 .",

    "we believe it should be possible to use dehn - sommerville relations to estimate the kalai curvature better on this space . but",
    "this requires to understand quantitatively the projection @xmath166 onto the dehn - sommerville space and then the vector @xmath167 .",
    "+ due to its multi - linear nature , one can not expect much from the wu characteristic @xmath168 at first .",
    "actually , it starts with bad news : @xmath168 is not a homotopy invariant , as @xmath169 but @xmath170 , despite that @xmath73 and @xmath171 are homotopic .",
    "interestingly , the wu characteristic @xmath168 picks up the dimension of a simplex and @xmath172 so that one can write more elegantly @xmath173 note that @xmath174 as the case @xmath175 shows where @xmath176 , but @xmath177 .",
    "as @xmath168 is invariant under barycentric refinement , it has been called * combinatorial invariant * ( see section 1.2 of @xcite ) , where polynomial functionals @xmath178 and @xmath179 were defined , which sum over all possible subsets @xmath180 of @xmath110 and where @xmath181 is the @xmath53th betti number of @xmath182 the graph generated by the set @xmath183 . like euler characteristics ,",
    "also the wu characteristic @xmath168 is a functional @xmath22 on the class of simplicial sub - complexes of @xmath4 but @xmath168 is not a valuation : the kite graph @xmath4 has @xmath184 but two triangular subgraphs @xmath7 with @xmath185 but @xmath186 so that @xmath187 but and @xmath188 .",
    "the wu characteristic is a quadratic valuation as defined above .",
    "just having mentioned polynomial invariants , one could combine all wu characteristics and define the * wu function * @xmath189 where @xmath105 is the euler characteristic , @xmath109 the wu characteristic , @xmath190 the cubic wu characteristic etc . for a graph @xmath191 or @xmath1-ball ,",
    "we have @xmath192 , for a @xmath1-graph @xmath4 , the wu function is @xmath193 .",
    "the figure @xmath143 graph @xmath4 with @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 is already a case where we do nt yet have a closed form for @xmath198 .",
    "+ we will see that any of the @xmath123 can be computed fast for most graphs as it satisfies a poincar - hopf formula and @xmath199 for @xmath1-graphs with boundary .",
    "also @xmath200 etc .",
    "what happens is that the index entering in poincar - hopf is a valuation on the unit sphere , allowing to apply poincar - hopf again there etc .",
    "so , for most graphs in the erds - renyi space of all graphs with @xmath201 elements , also the wu characteristic can be computed quickly .",
    "the complexity for computing @xmath168 is polynomial in @xmath201 , if one insists for example that for any finite intersection of unit spheres , maximally 99% of all possible connections between vertices in the unit sphere are present .",
    "this especially applies for @xmath1-graphs , where any finite intersection of unit spheres is a @xmath53-sphere .",
    "a consequence of the boundary formula is that for 2-spheres , we still have @xmath202 where @xmath129 .",
    "the proof of the reduction to euler characteristic makes use of the gauss - bonnet result for multi - linear valuations which in particular holds for the wu characteristics .",
    "it turns out that in the interior of a @xmath1-graph , in distance 2 or larger from the boundary , the curvature of the wu characteristic @xmath168 is the same than the curvature of the euler characteristic @xmath17 . for odd dimensional graphs ,",
    "the curvature of @xmath168 lives near the boundary of @xmath4 , similarly than the curvature for euler characteristic . for an even dimensional graph with boundary , the curvatures for euler characteristic or wu characteristics are in the interior .",
    "the proof of the boundary formula @xmath199 reveals what needs to be satisfied : for each unit sphere , we have to be able to use induction .",
    "the formula shows that @xmath168 measures the euler characteristic of a  virtual interior \" of a graph .",
    "this interior is no more a graph but a chain as forming complements throws us out of the category of graphs into a larger category of chains : take the two boundary points of @xmath73 away , then we end up with an edge which has no vertices attached and which is not a graph any more .",
    "it is the virtual interior of @xmath73 and has euler characteristic @xmath72 which is the wu characteristic of @xmath73 . because of invariance under barycentric subdivision ,",
    "the wu characteristic is defined also in the continuum limit for compact manifolds @xmath203 with boundary @xmath204 , where it satisfies the same boundary formula @xmath205 . while expressible by euler characteristic for discrete manifolds , the wu invariant becomes interesting for * varieties * as we see already in simple examples like the lemniscate @xmath206 which has the wu characteristic @xmath207 and euler characteristic @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , we can compute the curvature of the wu - invariant at a singularity of a projective variety by discretization using a graph .",
    "quadratic valuations are useful too as they produce intersection numbers @xmath208 for any pairs of subgraphs and so an intersection number of a pair of varieties .",
    "two @xmath93-dimensional circular graphs @xmath7 for example crossing twice have intersection number @xmath82 .",
    "+ we restrict here to the language of graphs .",
    "this means that we look only at abstract simplicial complexes which are whitney complexes of some graph . like with topologies , measure structures or other constructs placed on a set",
    ", one could consider different simplicial complexes on the same graph .",
    "the @xmath93-dimensional skeleton - complex consisting of vertices and edges is an example .",
    "it is too small for geometry as it treats any graph as a  curve \" .",
    "the neighborhood complex is an other example , but it renders the dimension too large ; for a wheel graph with boundary @xmath209 for example , the neighborhood complex would be @xmath201-dimensional .. the sweet spot is the whitney complex defined by all complete subgraphs of @xmath4 . for the wheel graph @xmath210 for example , it renders it a discrete disc of dimension @xmath82 , with euler characteristic @xmath93 , which is contractible and has a @xmath93-dimensional boundary @xmath209 .",
    "the geometry , cohomology , homotopy , even spectral theory all behave similarly as in the continuum .",
    "the language of graphs is intuitive and not much of generality is lost : while not every abstract finite simplicial complex on @xmath4 is a whitney complex of a finite graph - the simplicial complex with algebraic representation @xmath211 is the smallest example which fails to be a whitney complex - the barycentric refinement of an arbitrary finite abstract simplicial complex is always the whitney complex of a finite simple graph . in the above triangle without 2-simplex , the refinement of the complex is the whitney complex of @xmath212 .",
    "valuations on graphs satisfy a gauss - bonnet formula .",
    "for the valuation @xmath213 , this is the fundamental theorem of graph theory , a name sometimes applied only for the euler handshaking lemma which is gauss - bonnet for @xmath214 .",
    "we will see that gauss - bonnet generalizes to multi - linear valuations but curvature depend now on the ball of radius @xmath82 .",
    "the curvature remains local but in some sense has become a second order difference operator similarly as in the continuum , where the curvature tensor uses second derivatives . the language of graphs is equivalent but more intuitive especially when dealing with valuations as a classically , valuation are defined as functionals on simplicial sub complexes of a complex on @xmath110 so that classically ; it is important to realize that a valuation is not a map from subsets of @xmath110 to @xmath215 but a map from sets of subsets of @xmath110 .",
    "it is much easier to work with real - valued maps from the set of subgraphs of @xmath4 to @xmath216 .",
    "subgraphs have the intuitive feel of subsets but encode simplicial complexes .",
    "the use of valuations as a functional on the set of graphs is language which allows to work with valuations using the intuition we know from measures .",
    "+ on a graph @xmath0 , the discrete hadwiger theorem @xcite assures that the dimension of the space of valuations on @xmath4 is the clique number @xmath160 of @xmath4 . a basis is given by the functionals @xmath217 , counting the number @xmath218 subgraphs of @xmath4 .",
