    "in the beginning of the development of inflationary cosmology our main goal was to find some simple semi - realistic versions of inflationary theory , where inflation could be naturally realized for a wide variety of initial conditions . the search for such models",
    "has lead us to the discovery of chaotic inflation @xcite , where inflation can be achieved in the simplest models , such as the models of the fields minimally coupled to gravity , with polynomial potentials .",
    "inflation occurs in such models for a wide variety of initial conditions @xcite and may continue eternally @xcite .    in this class of theories the constant part of the scalar field",
    "does not have any independent physical meaning ; its value enters the theory only because it makes other fields massive , and because it has a potential energy density @xmath5 . as a result , these theories have a weakly broken shift symmetry @xmath6 .",
    "this is broken only by the @xmath7-dependence of the potential @xmath8 and of the masses of particles interacting with the field @xmath7 .",
    "it is this property which allows the existence of chaotic inflation potentials such as @xmath9 , which remain flat even for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "shift symmetries forbid the dangerous quantum corrections to the effective potential @xmath11 often discussed in the literature which renders inflation in these theories easier to achieve ; see @xcite for a recent discussion of this issue .",
    "another popular example of shift symmetry is the symmetry @xmath12 of the axion potential ; this potential appears only after the shift symmetry becomes broken by non - perturbative effects .",
    "this symmetry was the basis for the so - called natural inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "however , in supergravity and string theory the scalar fields usually have physical or geometric meaning . for example , in the simplest supergravity models the khler potential @xmath13 describes khler geometry .",
    "the f - term scalar potential is proportional to @xmath14 . as a result ,",
    "the mass of the inflaton field typically acquires a contribution @xmath15 , which tends to prevent inflation .",
    "quite often , one can fine tune the parameters of the theory and achieve desirable flatness of the potential for some small range of the values of the scalar fields . in such models ,",
    "inflation in a certain sense happens by accident : one must have the parameters of the models fixed in a very narrow range , and in addition , one should hope that the scalar field from the very beginning by some happy accident was in the required range of its values where inflation is possible .",
    "a similar situation , which can be called ` accidental inflation , ' often occurs in string theory .",
    "an interesting and quite instructive model of this type was proposed by holman , ramond and ross @xcite .",
    "we will briefly describe it here , because it will be closely related to the models of string theory inflation to be discussed in this paper .",
    "the khler potential in this model is @xmath13 , and the superpotential is w = c ( -_0)^2  , where @xmath16 , and @xmath7 and @xmath17 are canonically normalized scalar fields . the potential has a minimum at @xmath18 , @xmath19 .    in what follows",
    ", we will work in units @xmath20 .",
    "for the particular case @xmath21 , the potential @xmath5 is shown by the thick blue solid line in fig .",
    "1 . it has a minimum at @xmath22 , and a small plateau at @xmath23 , where the potential is described by the simple equation [ cubic ] v ( ) = v_0 ( 1 - 2 ^3 + o(1)^4 )  , where @xmath24 .",
    "this potential is flat at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which corresponds to an inflection point .",
    "since the slow - roll parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish at @xmath25 , this potential can support inflation if the initial value of the field is sufficiently small .",
    "the slow - roll conditions in this model are satisfied for @xmath29 .",
    "the field @xmath30 corresponding to the beginning of the period of the last 60 e - foldings is even much smaller .",
    "therefore it is quite sufficient to use just the first two terms of the expression ( [ cubic ] ) , i.e. the constant and the cubic term , for investigation of inflation in this model .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is no special reason why @xmath31 must be exactly equal @xmath32 .",
    "if we take , for example , @xmath33 , we will obtain a steep potential shown by the thin red solid line in fig . 1 , and inflation disappears .",
    "for @xmath34 , the potential has two minima and a non - inflationary maximum with @xmath35 .",
    "to achieve 60 e - folds of inflation in this scenario one must have @xmath36 with a great accuracy , and the universe from the very beginning should reside very close to the inflection point @xmath25 . in this sense , inflation happens in the models of this type by accident .",
    "this model was proposed back in 1984 .",
    "it took 10 years , from 1984 to 1994 , until the hybrid inflation scenario was developed @xcite and it became possible to introduce the f - term @xcite and the d - term hybrid inflation scenario @xcite , where inflation could appear in a relatively natural way .",
    "it took 6 more years after that until the simple realization of chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential was proposed in supergravity @xcite , and it took 7 more years until a supergravity realization of natural inflation became possible @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of inflation in string theory began only in 2003 , after the development of the kklt mechanism of vacuum stabilization @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the first string inflation model based on the kklt mechanism , the kklmmt model @xcite , is a brane inflation version of the hybrid inflation scenario .",
    "a detailed investigation of this model @xcite demonstrated that its inflationary potential is very similar to the inflection point potential of ref .",
    "thus , in a certain sense , in the recent studies of string theory inflation we returned to the discussion of accidental inflation in the first models of inflation in supergravity .    in parallel with the investigation of the kklmmt scenario , string theorists are trying to develop more natural versions of inflationary theory , where the inflationary potential would naturally have flat directions , such as d3/d7 inflation @xcite .",
    "we do not know yet whether it is possible to obtain a generalization of the chaotic inflation scenario and/or of the natural inflation scenario ; some related ideas are discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "as we just mentioned , the search for such models in supergravity took many years .",
    "the investigation of inflation in string theory has just began .",
    "therefore at this early stage it may make a lot of sense to study the models of accidental inflation discussed above , despite the fact that they appear fine - tuned in more than one respect",
    ". this may be quite appropriate because the old ideas of naturalness , unnaturalness and fine - tuning look quite different in the context of the eternal inflation scenario in the string theory landscape consisting of @xmath37 different string theory vacua @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will pursue two different goals .",
    "first of all , the dynamical mechanism of inflation in the kklmmt model is quite complicated .",
    "it involves investigation of gravitational effects related to the motion of branes in warped space , which requires a consistent merger of open string theory and closed string theory",
    ". therefore it would be nice to have a simple toy model of accidental inflation in string theory , analogous to the model of ref .",
    "an example of such model will be presented in section [ klinf ] .",
    "secondly , we would like to understand generic features of accidental inflation in the context of the string landscape scenario , and , if possible , to find some unambiguous predictions of this class of models which would allow us to distinguish it from other versions of string inflation .",
    "these issues will be discussed in sections [ toyinf ]  [ predict ] .",
    "we will summarize our results in section [ concl ] .",
    "a short discussion concerning eternal inflation can be found in the appendix .",
    "for a long time , it did not seem possible that the volume modulus may play the role of the inflaton field in the kklt construction .",
    "indeed , the standard kklt potential has only one minimum at finite values of the volume modulus , and the slow - roll conditions for this potential are strongly violated  @xcite .",
    "the situation did not change much with the invention of the racetrack inflation : it became possible to find a saddle point of the potential and satisfy the slow - roll conditions with respect to the axion field , but not with respect to the volume modulus @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we propose a model of string theory inflation driven by the volume modulus in the context of the kl  @xcite model of moduli stabilization .",
    "( another model of the volume modulus inflation will be described soon in @xcite . ) here the combination of fluxes with a racetrack superpotential leads to a scalar potential with two local asymmetric minima for the volume modulus which become de sitter after uplifting by e.g. 3bar - branes or -induced d - terms .",
    "the higher of the two minima connects through a saddle point to the late - time ds minimum , or degenerates into an inflection point . with a proper choice of parameters",
    ", one can make the potential near the saddle point or the inflection point sufficiently flat to provide for more than the necessary 60 e - foldings of slow - roll inflation driven by the volume modulus .    to begin with , we shall thus shortly review the structure of the kl setup  @xcite .",
    "the model starts out similar to the kklt construction  @xcite by assuming that the complex structure moduli and the axion - dilaton have been frozen at a high kk - related mass scale by turning on sufficiently generic 3-form fluxes @xmath38 along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "with respect to the khler moduli this results in a constant and fine - tunable term @xmath39 in superpotential of the low - energy effective 4d @xmath40 supergravity . considering then the subclass of calabi - yau 3-folds with @xmath41 , i.e. a single khler modulus which is the volume modulus @xmath42 , the presence of non - perturbative effects leads to the stabilization of @xmath42 .",
    "these exponential terms arise either from euclidean -branes of from gaugino condensation on -branes , as explained in @xcite .",
    "if there is only one exponential term in the superpotential , then this leads directly to the kklt construction .    the kl model",
    "is then specified by assuming the presence of non - perturbative contributions in @xmath42 to the superpotential , leading to a racetrack superpotential .",
    "thus the setup is given by k & = & - 3 ( t + ) , t=+i  , + & & + w & = & w_0 + ae^-at+ be^-bt  , [ setup ] where the volume modulus @xmath7 measuring the volume of the single 4-cycle of the calabi - yau pairs up with the rr - axion @xmath43 to form the complex chiral superfield @xmath42 .    the f - term scalar potential , v= e^k ( g^t t d_tw - 3|w|^2 ) , as the function of the volume modulus @xmath7 is given by & & v= ( b b e^a+ a a e^b ) + & & . [ pot ] it can be shown that this is a minimum in the axion direction , provided we take we take @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be all real and the sign of @xmath47 and @xmath48 opposite , as well as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    up to this point , the kl model does not differ from other racetrack models .",
    "however , as it was found in @xcite , the scalar potential in this model for some values of its parameters has _ two _ supersymmetric ads minima which solve @xmath51 .",
    "the one at smaller volume is given ( similarly to the heterotic racetrack models ) by _",
    "||  , [ retcr ] while the one at larger volume is the deeper ads minimum of the two with its position determined similarly to the kklt case _",
    "kklt - like~-(w_0/a).[retads ] in the special case where one arranges for a particular relation between the parameters of the superpotential , -w_0= a ||^ + b || ^  , the smaller volume ` racetrack - like ' minimum actually becomes a susy minkowski one with vanishing gravitino mass  @xcite .",
    "one can then get a late - time de sitter vacuum by adding , e.g. 3bar - branes , which due to warping provide for a hierarchically small supersymmetry breaking and uplifting term @xmath52 in the scalar potential .- flux  @xcite , f - terms of hidden sector matter fields  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , meta - stable vacua of condensing gauge theories in the free magnetic range along the lines of iss  @xcite , and @xmath53-corrections  @xcite ] this lifting can then be used to either lift the smaller volume ( and more shallow ) ads / minkowski minimum eq .",
    "to a tiny positive value of the cosmological constant , or to lift the deeper ads minimum eq .  .",
    "in this latter possibility , the smaller volume minimum eq .   becomes much more strongly lifted and acquires a large positive cosmological constant .",
    "since in many cases it will still be separated from the lower ds minimum at larger volume by a barrier , this specific sub - setup realizes the situation depicted in the context of the toy model of the last section in fig .",
    "[ ramond ] .",
    "it is now clear that by tuning @xmath46 and ( through their dependence on the vev s of the complex structure moduli ) also @xmath47 and @xmath48 with fluxes , we can arrange for the higher - lying minimum at smaller volume to degenerate with the barrier saddle point . as this will guarantee the existence of a very flat saddle or inflection point , which can lead to inflationary regime . for instance , a choice of parameters w_0&= & 410 ^ -8 ,  a=1 ,  b=-0.62704017319 , + & & + a&= & ,  b = c=3.0110 ^ -18[input ] for the full uplifted scalar potential v= e^k ( g^t t d_tw - 3|w|^2 ) + leads - as discussed below - to a long period of volume modulus inflation of more than 190 e - folds .",

    "fine - tuning in the model @xcite can be described in the following general way .",

    "thus in order to achieve inflation one should first find a potential with a metastable ds minimum close to a local maximum of @xmath5 , and then change the parameters in such a way as to make these two extrema very close , which automatically will make the slow - roll parameters small .",
    "the required fine - tuning can be expressed in terms of the fine - tuning of the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "one can look at this situation from a slightly different but closely related perspective . in accidental inflation , by definition ,",
    "inflation occurs by chance , in a small vicinity of some point which can be called @xmath92 without any loss of generality .",
    "consider the potential in a vicinity of this point and expand it in powers of @xmath7 : [ cubic1 ] v ( ) = v_0 ( 1 + _ 1 + ^2 + ^3 + ^4 + ... ) if the potential has flat directions , as in the simplest versions of chaotic or natural inflation , then one may consider theories where only few first terms are present @xcite .",
    "however , in most of the versions of string inflation all parameters @xmath93 can be large , so making some of them small requires fine - tuning .",
    "slow roll inflation is possible for @xmath94 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath97 , which is indeed the case in the two models which we considered so far .",
    "unless one fine - tunes @xmath98 , one can ignore the quartic term while describing inflation at @xmath99 .",
    "this means that in accidental inflation , which occurs only at @xmath99 , it is generically sufficient to use only three first terms in the expansion of the potential .",
    "moreover , one can show that by a shift @xmath100 in a theory with @xmath87 , @xmath97 , one can always represent the potential ( [ cubic1 ] ) in the form where either @xmath101 , or @xmath102 .",
    "for example , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite one has three possibilities illustrated by fig .",
    "@xmath103 one has an inflection point at @xmath25 where @xmath104 .",

    "meanwhile for @xmath105 one can always make a change of variables bringing the potential to the form [ 13 ] v ( ) = v_0 ( 1 + _ 1 + ^3 + ... )  .",
    "we ignored here the quartic term because accidental inflation , by definition , occurs only for @xmath23 . therefore , unless one makes an additional fine - tuning @xmath108 , one can ignore the term @xmath109 in the description of inflationary dynamics in these models . , which is the trademark of accidental inflation .",
    "in other words , we study generic features of the worst case scenario",
    ". it should remain our goal to search for the models with large flat directions . ]    an important exception is represented by the models where the potentials have a maximum with @xmath110 symmetry @xmath111 . in this case",
    "[ 24 ] v ( ) = v_0 ( 1 + ^2 + ^4 + ... )  , and the required fine - tuning is @xmath96 . in this case inflation",
    "is most efficient in the limit @xmath112 , which corresponds to the purely quartic potential with @xmath113 .",
    "this is what happens in the original versions of the new inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "this regime was also found in the racetrack inflation models @xcite , where inflation occurs during the rolling in the axion direction from the saddle point of the potential .",
    "note that it is insufficient to simply take @xmath114 or @xmath115 , respectively , in our models .",
    "the required fine - tuning should be somewhat stronger as we want to achieve more than 50 or 60 e - folds of inflation .",
    "as an example , one may consider the potential describing an inflection point and check how small should be the constant @xmath90 .",
    "investigation of this situation was performed in  @xcite , and result for the total number of e - folding during inflation is n_tot=_0^ = _ 0^=  .[ntotbaum ] in order to avoid significant running of the spectrum , one must have @xmath116 .",
    "this leads to a condition _ 1 10 ^ -3 _ 3 ^ -1 10 ^ -3  , [ tunerunning ] whereas we already assumed that @xmath97 ( this assumption is justified below ) .",
    "thus we must have fine - tuning at least of the order @xmath117 .",
    "we must fine - tune @xmath91 in a similar way in the models ( [ 23 ] ) , ( [ 24 ] ) .    while this fine - tuning is certainly not nice , in the next section we will explain possible reasons which may make it looking quite natural .",
    "the values of the slow roll parameters , the duration of inflation , and the spectral index @xmath118 depend only on the @xmath93 , but they do not depend on the overall factor @xmath85",
    ". meanwhile the square of the amplitude of metric perturbations @xmath69 scales as @xmath85 .",
    "this allows to achieve an inflationary regime with desirable properties by fine - tuning @xmath90 or @xmath119 , and then dial the desirable amplitude of perturbations of metric by changing @xmath85 without changing @xmath93 any further @xcite .",
    "the structure of the model discussed before  inflation starts driven by a single field direction from either a flat saddle or a flat inflection point of the potential",
    " lends itself to an analytical treatment of the inflationary dynamics with respect to the properties of the power spectrum of density fluctuations generated during slow - roll .",
    "the starting point is the observation , that due to the fact that the whole inflationary dynamics is governed by very small field displacements @xmath120 away from the saddle / inflection point at @xmath121 , we can canonically normalize the field @xmath7 in the vicinity of the unstable point and describe its motion by expanding the potential around the unstable point and ` renormalizing ' every derivative with respect to @xmath7 as @xmath122 .",
    "this leads to slow - roll parameters defined as & = & ( ) ^2 + & & + & = & .next , we write the expansion eq .   of the potential around the unstable point as [ vexp ] v ( ) = v_0(1+_p1^p )  . here",

    "successful inflation requires us then to tune small either @xmath130 ( inflection point ) or @xmath119 ( saddle point ) .    following the discussion of the last section , we can thus parametrize the leading approximation to the potential in the two cases as v=    v_0(1-_1-^3 ) & + v_0(1+^2^p ) &    where we have _ 2=_0(0)=-m^2/v_0<0  .",

    "we can now re - enter the linear or quadratic term , respectively , into the two cases of an inflection or a saddle point . keeping them will enable to derive the dependence of spectral properties like @xmath177 on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "let us see first what will happen if we add back to our cubic potential the term @xmath188 with @xmath189 . in this case",
    "the field @xmath7 will roll down a bit faster , and the total number of e - folding will be smaller .",
    "the corresponding effect will be relatively insignificant if [ tuning ] |_1| |_3||^2 ~(24 ^ 2)^-2/3 |_3|^1/3 v_0 ^ 2/3  .",
    "for example , if one considers the semi - realistic case @xmath190 and @xmath191 , this constraint means that for [ tuning2 ] |_1| 10 ^ -10 the average total growth of volume during inflation in a vicinity of any given point will remain as large as @xmath192 . on the other hand , if we consider the case which , naively , would seem much more natural , @xmath193 , then the average total growth of volume during inflation will become exponentially smaller .",
    "as we already mentioned , the total degree of inflationary expansion will exceed the required 60 e - foldings for much smaller fine - tuning , @xmath194 , but it produces a growth of volume which is smaller than the volume produced for @xmath195 by the enormous factor of @xmath196 .",
    "now let us discuss the fine tuning of initial conditions in accidental inflation . according to ( [ phibar ] ) , if initially the absolute value of the field @xmath7 in our part of the universe was smaller than @xmath197 , then the volume of this part grows by an enormous factor @xmath198 ( for @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) .",
    "however , if the field initially was at a greater distance from the inflection point , the gain in volume immediately becomes much smaller .",
    "this is an important fact to keep in mind while discussing naturalness of initial conditions for inflation .",
    "an additional factor is the process of eternal inflation , which also occurs only for small @xmath7 , see appendix .",
    "an interesting feature of our results is that the total growth of volume does not increase when we fine - tune @xmath90 with an accuracy greater than @xmath201 . in other words ,",
    "our considerations do not predict @xmath101 ; they predict @xmath200 .    similarly , if we add the quadratic term @xmath202 to the model with @xmath203 and @xmath204 , the total amount of inflation will be unaffected for @xmath205 , and it will decrease dramatically for @xmath206 .",
    "finally if we consider the @xmath176-symmetric class of models with a quartic potential with @xmath155 , and add to it the quadratic term @xmath202 , then the average total growth of volume during inflation in a vicinity of any given point remains in the range of @xmath207 for @xmath208 , and it will rapidly drop down for @xmath209 .    let us now discuss the consequences of these results for understanding of naturalness / unnaturalness of fine - tuning required for accidental inflation .",
    "here we should remember that inflation in string theory landscape is always eternal because of the existence of an incredibly large number of metastable vacua @xcite .",
    "the problem of assigning probabilities for various histories in the eternal inflation scenario is still a subject of intense debates .",
    "one of the popular ideas is that the probability to be born in a particular part of the landscape is proportional to the volume of the parts of the landscape of a given type , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "many authors agree that the volume - weighted probability should be proportional to the growth of volume during the slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the results obtained above suggest that the fine - tuning of @xmath90 and @xmath91 required for accidental inflation is in fact quite natural ; see @xcite for a discussion of related ideas , and the appendix of our paper where we reach similar conclusions using slightly different assumptions .",
    "these arguments also imply that the most probable values for the spectral index in this class of models will be the asymptotic values of eq .   for the pure cubic ( or quartic , in case of a @xmath176-symmetric potential ) case discussed above",
    ":    using the volume - weighted measure , we should expect to find ourselves in a hubble volume with a long period of slow - roll inflation in the past . and as we noted above , maximizing the amount slow - roll inflation implies having either @xmath210 or @xmath211 corresponding to a very large @xmath212 .",
    "looking again at fig .",
    "[ specindex_analytic ] , it becomes clear that the asymptotic values of eq .",
    "for the pure cubic ( or quartic , in case of a @xmath176-symmetric potential )    n_s0.93z_2v + n_s0.95z_2v    become a tentative prediction for accidental inflation in the string theory landscape .",
    "together with the negligible tensor fraction @xmath1 this is the hallmark of accidental inflation in string theory .",
    "we call this prediction tentative because it is based on certain assumptions about the probability measure . moreover , it may change if we are allowed to fine - tune even further , by fine - tuning @xmath213 to zero ( which would lead to a greater value of @xmath187 ) , changing @xmath85 , the amplitude of density perturbations , etc . ,",
    "see the appendix for a discussion of this issue .",
    "we have shown that the generic presence of racetrack superpotentials together with fluxes leads to a realization of volume modulus inflation in type iib string theory . the central observation there is that the multi - exponential superpotential generically leads to more than one local minimum .",
    "this can be used to tune the higher - lying of two adjacent minima to ( nearly ) degenerate with the separating barrier into a very flat saddle or inflection point , which then drives slow - roll inflation . following these considerations , in section [ klinf ] we constructed a model of volume modulus inflation , which is one of the simplest models of string theory inflation available now .",
    "inflation in a vicinity of an inflection or saddle point requires fine - tuning of the model parameters and of the initial conditions .",
    "however , this simple setup describes both the majority of known closed - string modular inflation models  @xcite , as well as the recently improved kklmmt model  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamics of accidental inflation described in this paper may represent one of the most generic classes of inflationary models , covering a large part of the landscape .",
    "the required fine tuning may appear quite natural if one takes into account that it dramatically increases the total growth of volume during inflation , and may even make inflation eternal .",
    "this fact leads to a statistical prediction of the spectral index @xmath3 , or @xmath2 , depending on whether the potential is @xmath176-symmetric or not .",
    "furthermore , the value @xmath2 for @xmath176-symmetric potentials by means of this symmetry is an upper limit ( see fig .",
    "[ specindex_analytic ] ) as long as we tune just the first even power in such a potential , i.e. @xmath119 . to zero",
    "( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these results , combined with a prediction of a negligibly small tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 , become a testable ( tentative ) prediction for a large class of models of inflation in string theory .",

    "if quantum jumps of the field @xmath7 dominate its classical rolling during a typical time @xmath214 , then each domain of a size @xmath214 will eternally split into many new domains , in some of which the field will over and again jump back arbitrarily close to @xmath126 , forever re - starting the slow - roll process in different @xmath215-sized domains .",
    "this leads to eternal inflation  @xcite .",
    "it occurs for fields satisfying the following generic condition @xcite : _",

    "the probability measure in eternal inflation regime is somewhat ambiguous because we must compare infinities , which produces regularization - dependent results .",
    "several different approaches to this question suggest that the probability should be proportional to the growth of volume during inflation in the slow - roll regime .",
    "we used a version of this prescription in the main text . a slightly different prescription suggests that we should be interested only in the total number of e - foldings after the end of eternal inflation .      in comparison with the boundary of quantum diffusion , @xmath218 in eq .",
    ", one finds that for a purely quadratic potential at the top one gets @xmath219  @xcite while for all other @xmath179 one typically has @xmath220 .    the main point , however , is that the condition eq .  , which should be satisfied in order to get the maximum amount of slow - roll inflation after the end of either eternal inflation or quantum diffusion ( i.e. @xmath221 or @xmath222 for quantum diffusion or eternal inflation , respectively ) , for eternal inflation yields a condition |_1|(12 ^ 2)^-1/2 v_0 ^ 1/2  . in particular , for @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath223",
    "we get the condition @xmath224 . as before , for such a small @xmath90 we have an extremely large @xmath156 , and therefore we have the same prediction , @xmath225 .",
    "similarly for the theory with @xmath226 we find @xmath227 .",
    "thus our main conclusions coincide with the conclusions obtained in this paper by a somewhat different method .",
    "this boundary value @xmath229 is much smaller than the value @xmath230 needed for just 60 e - folds of slow - roll according to eq .  .",
    "thus , we see that for @xmath231 there is a whole range of values @xmath232 where there occurs no eternal inflation at all , but a pro - longed phase of slow - roll inflation with @xmath233 .",
    "this result shows , unambiguously , that the total number of observers in any part of the universe after inflation is proportional to e^3n_tot ~ ( )  .",
    "this quantity acquires its maximal value at the smallest possible value of @xmath90 within its domain of validity , i.e. at _ 1 ~_1^*(12 ^ 2)^-1/2 v_0 ^ 1/2 ~10 ^ -8 for @xmath154 .",
    "note that this constraint depends only on @xmath85 and is valid for any @xmath234 independently of @xmath235 .",
    "for @xmath236 eternal inflation becomes possible , which makes the total number of observers living in the post - inflationary universe indefinitely large .",
    "this shows that , independently of the choice of the probability measure during eternal inflation , the volume - weighted probability should be peaked at @xmath237 . once again",
    ", this leads to the prediction @xmath225 in this class of models , in agreement with the predictions obtained by other methods .",
    "a similar result can be derived for the saddle point case , where again for @xmath238 the total number of slow - roll e - folds becomes independent of @xmath119 . in the above case this value is @xmath239 , which implies that there is a prolonged phase of slow - roll inflation with @xmath233 . once again",
    ", this is an unambiguous prediction of the volume - weighted probability distribution , independently of the choice of the probability measure during eternal inflation in this scenario .",
    "this again leads to the prediction @xmath227 for inflation near the symmetric saddle point with @xmath226 .    of course , predictions of that type are only as good as the basic assumption that the probability to be born in parts of the universe of a certain type is proportional to the total number of observers in such parts .",
    "whereas this assumption seems quite natural and its various versions are widely accepted @xcite , there are some alternative proposals , which de - emphasize the growth of volume during inflation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "these proposals will lead to different predictions for @xmath187 , which opens a possibility to test various ideas concerning the probabilities in inflationary cosmology by comparing the consequences of these ideas with observational data .",
    "it is rather interesting that the final result for @xmath156 in eq .",
    "can be represented in a form directly related to the amplitude of perturbations of metric : [ expepm ] n_tot ~_r^-2 + 4/p   c_p  , where @xmath240 .",
    "note that dependence of the duration of inflation on @xmath85 and @xmath235 was totally absorbed in its dependence on @xmath241 and the total growth of volume during inflation is given by [ durationpert ] e^3n_tot ~(3_r^-2 + 4/p   c_p )  .",
    "taking this expressions to its limit would suggest that we might increase the volume factor further by decreasing the magnitude of metric perturbations which in turn corresponds to sending @xmath242 or @xmath243 .",
    "as it stands this would then predict that a universe like ours with a small but finite amount of metric fluctuations is extremely unlikely compared to universes with exponentially low fluctuation levels .",
    "this is the run - away problem described in  @xcite .",
    "various solutions to this problem have been proposed in the literature , see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "we will specifically mention a solution proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that the prior probability distribution should besides the volume factor of slow - roll inflation also contain an anthropic constraint arising from the necessity of sufficiently fast radiative cooling of primordial baryonic matter ( otherwise no structure forms before the protons decay ) and the threshold behavior of inflation - related cosmological quantities in terms of the observable fundamental inflationary parameters .",
    "in many simple models the cosmological quantity is the reheating temperature @xmath244 being a function of the inflation mass  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the anthropic constraint from sufficiently fast cooling generates an exponential suppression which counters the exponentially large volume factor .",
    "secondly then , the threshold behavior of @xmath245 as a function of the inflation mass ( the fundamental parameter ) leads to the volume factor @xmath246 being nearly flat when expressed as a function of @xmath245 in the threshold region of inflation decay ( while , of course , it still depends exponentially on the inflaton mass ) .",
    "the combined probability distribution then is ( unlike the volume factor alone ) approximately flat in the region @xmath247 which allows then the anthropic argument for @xmath248 to proceed  @xcite .    one way or another",
    ", we should separate the issue of _ explaining _ the observed value of @xmath69 and _ predicting _ the value of @xmath187 , which is not yet known with a sufficient precision , but will be known in the next few years ; see @xcite for a discussion of related issues .",
    "it is in this sense that we call the above results @xmath3 or @xmath2 tentative predictions for accidental inflation in the string theory landscape .",
