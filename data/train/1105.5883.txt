    "electron transport in strictly one - dimensional quantum wires is governed by the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "this is spectacularly demonstrated by the fact that within the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) model in the limit of temperature @xmath0 the conductance of a quantum wire with finite barrier tends to zero , provided the interaction is repulsive and assumes the maximum value @xmath1 ( in units of the conductance quantum @xmath2 ) for attractive interaction .",
    "the latter behavior appears independent of the strength of the scattering at the barrier , and can be traced back to the formation of friedel oscillations of the charge density around the barrier , leading to an infinitely extended effective barrier potential in that limit .",
    "tll behavior has recently been studied experimentally in carbon nano - tubes .",
    "@xcite in a future nanoelectronics constructed out of quantum wires , junctions of three or more wires will necessarily be involved , requiring a knowledge of the fundamental transport behavior of electrons in such structures .",
    "it is known that such systems exhibit rather rich tll effects which have been the subject of a number of recent papers .",
    "@xcite much of the work in this field has used the bosonization method , which gives rise to the problem of how to preserve the fermionic character of charge carriers . when the number of wires meeting at a junction exceeds two , the klein factors , which give fermi statistics to the bosonized operators of different wires , are more difficult to handle .",
    "@xcite oshikawa et al .",
    "recently introduced @xcite a new method to study this problem , mapping it into the dissipative hofstadter model ( dhm ) , which describes a single particle moving in a uniform magnetic field and a periodic potential in two dimensions and coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "when the three quantum wires enclose a magnetic flux , the mapping to the dhm also allows to identify a new low energy chiral fixed point with an asymmetric flow of current that is highly sensitive to the sign of the flux .",
    "the paper by @xcite is giving a systematic and thorough treatment of the three lead junction problem , and we shall refer to it later , when we compare our results with theirs",
    ". it should be noted , however , that in spite of their success , the above mentioned methods do not in general allow to determine the fixed point ( fp ) structure of the theory in an unbiased way , as they require a certain knowledge of the existence of fps as a starting point .    in this paper",
    "we follow a different route : we describe the transport properties in fermionic language , thus avoiding the problem of klein factors and the necessity to assume the existence of fps . as shown in our previous work",
    ", one may recover the known results on transport through a tll wire with barrier and obtain new results not accessible by other methods within the fermionic formulation .",
    "@xcite moreover , as this method is formulated in a scattering wave picture , the connection of the interacting wire to non - interacting reservoirs is naturally included .",
    "while this formulation has previously been regarded as being restricted to weak coupling @xcite we have shown in an earlier work that it may be extended to the strong coupling regime in a controlled way by using an infinite resummation of perturbation theory ( ladder summation ) .",
    "the result obtained in this approximation is universal , i.e. does not depend on the ultraviolet cutoff chosen .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a symmetric time - reversal invariant setup , which is characterized by two independent components of the conductance tensor .",
    "this setup in case of one wire without interaction is relevant to the problem of tunneling into a luttinger liquid and was studied in @xcite for weak interaction .",
    "there it has been found that the asymmetric fixed point a ( perfectly conducting wire and a vanishing tunneling amplitude into the tip , see below ) becomes unstable in the case of weak repulsive interaction once the description of the y - junction is not reduced to the simple tunneling model . a further remarkable result of that work is the finding of a nonmonotonic behavior of the conductance ( e.g. as a function of temperature ) , in certain cases .",
    "we extend that work here to arbitrary interaction and find similar behavior at strong interaction .",
    "the resulting coupled rg equations will first be analyzed with respect to their fixed point structure .",
    "we find four fixed points , labelled n , a , m , q , where at n ( neumann ) the three wires are totally separated , at a ( asymmetric ) the third wire is separated , while the main wire is perfectly conducting , at m ( mystery ) and q ( quaint ) the conductances take an intermediate value , depending on the interaction strength .",
    "all fixed points are located on the boundary curve marking the allowed area in the plane of the two conductances . for repulsive interaction",
    "only n is stable , a being a saddle point . for attractive interaction",
    "n is unstable and m is stable . for stronger attractive interaction , beyond a threshold value a",
    "becomes an additional stable fixed point .",
    "the conductances are calculated analytically for several special cases of interest .",
    "we present and discuss the power law exponents appearing in the various regimes .    in order to check the reliability of the ladder summation result",
    ", we calculate all scale dependent terms ( in the limit of @xmath3 ) up to third order in the interaction . we find several terms additional to the ladder terms .",
    "these terms are nonuniversal and subleading , in the sense that they disappear for the case of repulsive interaction , when one of the stable fixed points is approached .",
    "for attractive interaction , the properties of the new fixed point m appear to be affected by the three - loop terms beyond the ladder approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] we define the model of a y- junction considered here .",
    "we introduce the currents in the su(3)-representation and define the hamiltonian in the chiral representation .",
    "section [ sec : smatcond ] is devoted to an analysis of the scattering matrix and the derivation of the conductance tensor in terms of the s - matrix components .",
    "we consider a simple tunneling case and the totally symmetric case , both characterized by only a single free parameter in the s - matrix and the general y - junction case with two parameters and therefore two independent conductance components . in section [ sec : rgeq ] we show how the rg equation for the simple tunneling case is extracted from perturbation theory in the ladder approximation , and discuss the ensuing conductance .",

    "we further present the results on the nonuniversal terms in third order perturbation theory in section [ sec : perturb1 ] . finally , the rg phase diagram is presented and discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider the setup of a y - junction : a quantum wire of finite length @xmath4 connected to noninteracting leads , and a tip with attached wire forming a contact ( junction ) in the center of the wire , which for simplicity is assumed to have the same length @xmath5 , also connected to a noninteracting lead .",
    "we choose the origin of the coordinate system at the junction and denote the two halves of the main wire by indices 1 and 2 and the tip by 3 .",

    "the electrons are assumed to interact via a short - ranged interaction of arbitrary strength and sign between incoming and outgoing fermions . in the present case , instead of defining right- and left - movers , it is more appropriate to speak of incoming and outgoing waves , with respect to the junction , or `` origin ''",
    ".    the short - range interaction is characterized by the amplitude @xmath7 in the main wire ( 1 and 2 ) and a different amplitude @xmath8 in the third wire .",
    "this interaction takes place at @xmath9 , measuring from the origin . in order to spatially separate effects of the potential scattering at the origin and the interaction",

    "the matrix @xmath18 is unitary @xmath53 , which allows its parameterization via the exponential , @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , there is a redundancy in the description by the nine real - valued parameters @xmath55 in the exponent , as only the densities and not the fermion amplitudes enter the observables .",
    "the number of physically relevant parameters for the description of the @xmath18-matrix may be determined as follows .",
    "one may fix the relative @xmath56 phase between the ingoing and outgoing electrons in each wire , by demanding that the reflection coefficients are real valued .",
    "this excludes the @xmath57 and @xmath58 components .",

    "in addition the overall phase described by the @xmath59 term may be set to zero .",
    "a further reduction in the number of independent parameters may be derived from the following consideration . in the limit of three almost detached wires , we have @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "this limiting case elucidates the meaning of the @xmath62 as the tunneling amplitudes between the corresponding wires .",
    "for example , the infinitesimal hopping between wires 1 and 3 of the form @xmath63 leads to @xmath64 , @xmath65 with @xmath66 the fermi velocity , cf .",
    "it should be noted that this correspondence between the hamiltonian and the @xmath18-matrix holds only in the limiting cases , and starts to depend on the definition of the regularization procedure in higher orders of @xmath67 , i.e.  beyond the born approximation .",
    "@xcite    by using the above correspondence of the ( small ) @xmath55 and the tunneling amplitudes it becomes clear that without loss of generality one may require real - valued hopping amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 , i.e. coinciding phases for hopping from the third wire into wires @xmath44 or @xmath70 ( in the absence of magnetic flux ) .",
    "this makes @xmath71 .",
    "after that the phase of the complex valued amplitude @xmath72 between the wires 1 and 2 is fixed . in the absence of magnetic fields it must be zero @xcite anyway , which further reduces the number of components , since it requires @xmath73 .",
    "thus in the time - reversal invariant situation , the s - matrix can be parametrized by three angles , @xmath74 . in the presence of a magnetic field a fourth component , @xmath75 , appears .",
    "we do not consider this case here .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the case of tunneling into the center of a luttinger liquid wire .",
    "this amounts to full symmetry between the wires 1 and 2 , and it reduces the number of independent parameters further to only two , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    as mentioned above , we will in addition keep the angle @xmath78 .",
    "the reason for the introduction of the @xmath79 component is two - fold .",

[",

    "in the fully symmetric case of a junction of three identical wires ( identical interaction strength and reflection coefficients ) we have only one independent angle characterizing the s - matrix , @xmath94 .",
    "the connection to the above @xmath95 , @xmath96 is not very transparent , and up to an overall phase factor we have @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the observables we concentrate on in this work are the linear conductances .",
    "we first discuss the question of the number of independent linear conductances .",
