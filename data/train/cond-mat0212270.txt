    "recent advances in the molecules manipulation have made it possible to measure and characterize molecular properties at a single molecule level .",
    "one of basic characteristics is the extension - force curves ( efcs)@xcite .",
    "these curves have provided lots of interesting and useful physical information about studied molecules , going from the detailed elastic properties@xcite to complex structure transitions@xcite .",
    "on theoretical side , many kinds of models have been constructed to character and explain the recorded various efcs of different molecules @xcite . except computer simulations , e.g. , molecular dynamic or monte carlo sampling ,",
    "the calculation of the end - to - end distance distributions ( eedds ) of the force stretched molecules is the center problem in using statistical mechanical method . in principle",
    ", eedds can be obtained by partition function . but",
    "two questions must be faced firstly : one is what physical interactions should be taken into account ; the other is what mathematical technique is needed to solve the eedds .",
    "it is not easy to describe physical interactions in complex molecules , such as polyelectrolytes or proteins . while specific mathematical technique is not always useful in different molecular systems .",
    "in contrast to traditional mind , in this paper we try to extract eedds from the recorded efcs in experiments using the maximum - entropy ( or least - biased ) method ( mem ) .",
    "our motivations are that , first , to our knowledge , little concern about eedds has been given in previous force stretching models .",
    "although eedds of simpler molecules may be simpler enough , it is no reason to assume that they are still simple for complex molecules , such as secondary structure rna ; second , because the eedds are the results of interplay between intra - molecule and force , they can be seen as primitive examining for more realistic physical models .",
    "in addition , our studies also show that the eedd at vanishing force calculated by mem keeps almost all characteristic of the exact distribution without force .",
    "therefore this method may provide a possible way to directly  measure \" eedds by force spectroscopy .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . we first , in sec",
    ".  [ memintrod ] , briefly review the maximum entropy method . in sec .",
    "[ momentsefc ] , the basic relations between the distance moments and efcs are demonstrated . in sec .",
    "[ testmem ] , mem is examined by reconstructing eedds of three force stretching chain models : gaussian chain , free - joined chain and self - avoiding chain on 2-dimension lattice .",
    "we also show in sec .",
    "[ applicationrna ] that the method is capable of resolving eedds of complex chain molecules stretched by force . as an illustration , the model of force unzipping double - stranded chain molecules is used to provide exact efcs and eedds@xcite ; these results are necessary to calculate and compare eedds solved by mem . section .",

    "given a finite set of the moments of a distribution function , how to construct the function is an old mathematical problem .",

    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a function @xmath2 with a set of @xmath5 moments on interval @xmath3 are the hausdorff relations@xcite : @xmath8    the mem offers a definite procedure for the construction of the approximate distribution @xmath9 based on @xmath5 moments as the following form@xcite : @xmath10.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath11 are a set of @xmath5 constants determined by the @xmath5 known @xmath12 .",
    "this involves a straightforward nonlinear iterative procedure that usually converges rapidly@xcite .",
    "in general , a real distribution is not always defined on interval @xmath3 .",
    "hence the first step in using mem is to convert the distribution to a function on this interval@xcite . given that the power moments of the original distribution @xmath13 are @xmath14 , and the lower and upper bounds are designated as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "defining the extent of the distribution @xmath17 first , shift the moments @xmath14 to interval @xmath18 by @xmath19 then scale these moments @xmath20 to interval @xmath3 by @xmath21 thus mem can be used to calculate distribution @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , if the approximate distribution @xmath2 is solved from moments @xmath14 , the distribution can be first rescaled from interval @xmath3 to @xmath18 by the change of variable y @xmath22 then shift the distribution @xmath23 to interval @xmath24 by @xmath25",
