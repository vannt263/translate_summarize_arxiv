    "recently , the question of when a pseudo - riemannain manifold can be locally characterized by its scalar polynomial curvature invariants constructed from the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives has been addressed .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in four dimensions ( 4d ) a lorentzian spacetime metric is either @xmath0-non - degenerate , and hence locally characterized by its scalar polynomial curvature invariants , or is a degenerate kundt spacetime @xcite .",
    "therefore , the degenerate kundt spacetimes are the only spacetimes in 4d that are _ not _",
    "@xmath0-non - degenerate , and their metrics are the only metrics not uniquely determined by their curvature invariants . in the proof of the @xmath0-non - degenerate theorem in @xcite it was necessary , for example , to determine for which segre types for the ricci tensor the spacetime is @xmath0-non - degenerate . by analogy , in higher dimensions it is useful to utilize the bivector formalism for the weyl tensor .",
    "indeed , by defining the weyl bivector operator in higher dimensions @xcite and making use of the alignment theory @xcite , it is possible to algebraically classify any tensor ( including the weyl tensor utilizing the eigenbivector problem ) in a lorentzian spacetime of arbitrary dimensions , which has proven very useful in contemporary theoretical physics .",
    "the link between a metric ( or rather , when two metrics can be distinguished up to diffeomorphisms ) and the curvature tensors is provided through _",
    "cartan s equivalence principle_. an exact statement of this is given in @xcite ; however , the idea is that knowing the riemann curvature tensor , and its covariant derivatives , with respect to a fixed frame determines the metric up to isometry .",
    "it should be pointed out that it may be difficult to actually _ construct _ the metric , however , the metric is determined in principle .",
    "more precisely , given a point , @xmath1 , a frame @xmath2 , and the corresponding riemann tensor @xmath3 and its covariant derivatives @xmath4 , then if there exists a map such that : ( p , e _ ) & & ( |p,|e _ ) , + ( r_,r_;_1, ... ,r_;_1 ... _k ) & & ( |r_,|r_;_1, ... ,|r_;_1 ... _k ) , then there exists an isometry @xmath5 such that @xmath6 ( which induces the abovementioned map ) .",
    "therefore , if we know the components of the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives with respect to a fixed frame , then the geometry and , in principle , the metric is determined .",
    "the equivalence principle consequently manifests the connection between the curvature tensors and the spacetime metric .",
    "the question of whether we can , at least in principle , reconstruct the metric from the invariants thus hinges on the question whether we can reconstruct the curvature tensors from its scalar polynomial curvature invariants , indicated with a question mark in the following figure : @xmath7 it is to address this question , the curvature operators are particularly useful .",
    "in this paper we continue the study of pseudo - riemannain manifolds and their local scalar polynomial curvature invariants . in principle , we are interested in the case of arbitrary dimensions and all signatures , although we are primarily interested from a physical point of view in the lorentzian case and most illustrations will be done in 4d .",
    "we also briefly discuss the neutral signature case .",
    "first , we shall discuss the concept of a differentiable manifold being characterised by its scalar invariants in more detail .",
    "suppose we consider the set of invariants as a function of the metric and its derivatives : @xmath8 ( the @xmath9-map ) ; we are then interested in under what circumstances , given a set of invariants @xmath10 , this function has an inverse @xmath11 .",
    "for a metric which is @xmath0-non - degenerate the invariants characterize the spacetime uniquely , at least locally , in the space of ( lorentzian ) metrics , which means that we can therefore distinguish such metrics using their curvature invariants and , hence , @xmath11 is unique ( up to diffeomorphisms ) .",
    "we then further discuss curvature operators ( and introduce an operator calculus ) and their relationship to spacetime invariants .",
    "any even - ranked tensor can be considered as an operator , and there is a natural matrix representation of the operator @xmath12 . in particular , for a curvature operator ( such as the zeroth order curvature operator , @xmath13 ) we can consider an eigenvector @xmath14 with eigenvalue @xmath15 ; i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to introduce the important notion of _ diagonalisability_. in addition , we then introduce the notion of _ analytic metric extension _ , which is a complex analytic continuation of a real metric under more general coordinate transformations than the real diffeomorphisms which results in a real bilinear form but which does not necessarily preserve the metric signature .",
    "we shall show that if a space , @xmath17 , of any signature can be analytically continued ( in this sense ) to a riemannian space ( of euclidean signature ) , then that spacetime is characterised by its invariants .",
    "moreover , if a spacetime is not characterised by its invariants , then there exists no such analytical continuation of it to a riemannian space .    finally , we present a summary of the lorentzian signature case .",
    "all of the results presented here are illustrated in the 4d case .",
    "we also discuss the 4d pseudo - riemannian case of neutral signature @xmath18 ( ns space ) .",
    "consider the continuous metric deformations defined as follows @xcite .",
    "for a spacetime @xmath19 , a ( one - parameter ) _ metric deformation _ , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is a family of smooth metrics on @xmath22 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath20 is continuous in @xmath23 , 2 .",
    "@xmath24 ; and 3 .",
    "@xmath20 for @xmath25 , is not diffeomorphic to @xmath26 .    for any given spacetime @xmath19",
    "we define the set of all scalar polynomial curvature invariants @xmath27 therefore , we can consider the set of invariants as a function of the metric and its derivatives .",
    "however , we are interested in to what extent , or under what circumstances , this function has an inverse .",
    "more precisely , define the function @xmath8 ( the @xmath9-map ) to be the function that calculates the set of invariants @xmath0 from a metric @xmath28 .",
    "given a set of invariants , @xmath10 , what is the nature of the ( inverse ) set @xmath11 ? in order to address this question , we first need to introduce some terminology @xcite .",
    "consider a spacetime @xmath19 with a set of invariants @xmath0 .",
    "then , if there does not exist a metric deformation of @xmath26 having the same set of invariants as @xmath26 , then we will call the set of invariants _ non - degenerate_. furthermore , the spacetime metric @xmath26 , will be called _",
    "@xmath0-non - degenerate_.    this implies that for a metric which is @xmath0-non - degenerate the invariants characterize the spacetime uniquely , at least locally , in the space of ( lorentzian ) metrics .",
    "this means that these metrics are characterized by their curvature invariants and therefore we can distinguish such metrics using their invariants .",
    "since scalar curvature invariants are manifestly diffeomorphism - invariant we can thereby avoid the difficult issue whether a diffeomorphism exists connecting two spacetimes .    in the above sense of @xmath0-non - degeneracy , a spacetime is completely characterized by its invariants and there is only one ( non - isomorphic ) spacetime with this set of invariants ( at least locally in the space of metrics , in the sense above ) . however",
    ", we may also want to use the notion of characterization by scalar invariants in a different ( weaker ) sense ( see below ) . in order to emphasise the difference between such cases",
    ", we will say that @xmath0-non - degenerate metrics are characterised by their invariants _ in the strong sense _ , or in short , _ strongly _ characterised by their invariants ( this is the general sense , and if the clarifier ` strong sense ' is omitted , this meaning is implied ) .",
    "however , in the definition [ def : char ] ( below ) it is useful to regard a pseudo - riemannian manifold as being characterised by its invariants if the curvature tensors ( i.e. , the riemann tensor and all of its covariant derivatives ) can be reconstructed from a knowledge all of the scalar invariants .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0-non - degenerate metrics fall into this class , but another important class of metrics will also be included .",
    "for example , ( anti-)de sitter space is maximally symmetric and consequently has only one independent curvature component , and also only one independent curvature invariant ( namely the ricci scalar ) .",
    "therefore , we can determine the curvature tensors of ( anti-)de sitter space by knowing its invariants . in our definition , (",
    "anti-)de sitter space is not @xmath0-non - degenerate but it will be regarded as being characterised by its invariants .    therefore , we shall say that metrics that are characterised by their invariants but are not @xmath0-non - degenerate , are _ weakly _ characterised by their invariants .",
    "a common factor for metrics being characterised by their invariants is that the curvature tensors , and hence the spacetime , will inherit certain properties of the invariants . in particular , as we will see later , all csi spacetimes being characterised by their invariants will be automatically be locally homogeneous ; however , not all of them are @xmath0-non - degenerate , like ( anti-)de sitter space .",
    "the definition we will adopt is closely related to the familiar problem of diagonalising matrices .",
    "we will use curvature operator to relate our problem to linear algebra , and essentially , we will say that a spacetime is characterised by its invariants if we can diagonalise its curvature operators . in order to make this definition a bit more rigourous",
    ", we need to introduce some formal definitons .",
    "consider an even - ranked tensor @xmath29 . by raising or lowering the indices appropriately",
    ", we can construct the tensor with components @xmath30 .",
    "this tensor can be considered as an operator ( or an endomorphism ) mapping contravariant tensors onto contravariant tensors @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vectorspace @xmath33 , or , if the tensor possess index symmetries , @xmath34 . here ,",
    "since @xmath32 is a vectorspace , there exists a set of basis vectors @xmath35 so that @xmath36 . expressing @xmath12 in this basis , we can write the operator in component form : @xmath37 .",
    "this means that we have a natural matrix representation of the operator @xmath12 .",
    "note that we can similarly define a dual operator @xmath38 where @xmath39 , mapping covariant tensors onto covariant tensors . in component form",
    "the dual operator is @xmath40 which in matrix form can be seen as the transpose of @xmath12 ; i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , there is a natural isomorphism between the operator @xmath12 and its dual",
    ". we can also consider operators mapping mixed tensors onto mixed tensors .",
    "for an odd - ranked tensor , @xmath42 , we can also construct an operator : however , this time we need to consider the tensor product of @xmath42 with itself , @xmath43 , which is of even rank .",
    "we can also construct an operator with two odd - ranked tensors @xmath42 and @xmath44 : @xmath45 . in this way",
    "@xmath46 is even - ranked and we can lower / raise components appropriately .    now , consider an operator .",
    "if @xmath37 are the components in a certain basis , then this as a natural matrix representation .",
    "this is an advantage because now we can use standard results from linear algebra to estabish some related operators .",
    "the utility of these operators when it comes to invariants is obvious since any curvature invariant is always an invariant constructed from some operator .",
    "for example , the kretchmann invariant , @xmath47 , is trivially ( proportional to ) the trace of the operator @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , an arbitrary invariant , @xmath49 , is the trace of the operator @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that we can study the polynomial curvature invariants by studing the invariants of curvature operators .",
    "the archetypical example of a curvature operator is the ricci operator , @xmath51 , which maps vectors onto vectors ; i.e. , @xmath52 all of the ricci invariants can be constructed from the invariants of this operator , for example , @xmath53 is the ricci scalar and @xmath54 .",
    "another commonly used operator is the weyl operator , @xmath55 , which maps bivectors onto bivectors : @xmath56 the weyl invariants can also be constructed from this operator by considering traces of powers of @xmath55 : @xmath57 .",
    "for a curvature operator , @xmath12 , consider an eigenvector @xmath14 with eigenvalue @xmath15 ; i.e. , @xmath16 . note that the symmetry group @xmath58 of the spacetime ( of signature @xmath59 ) , is naturally imbedded through the tensor products @xmath60 . by considering the eigenvalues of @xmath61 as solutions of the characteristic equation : @xmath62 which are @xmath63-invariants .",
    "since the orthogonal group @xmath64 , using the tensor product , acts via a representation @xmath65 , hence , _ the eigenvalue of a curvature operator is an @xmath66-invariant curvature scalar_. therefore , curvature operators naturally provide us with a set of curvature invariants ( not necessarily polynomial invariants but derivable from them ) corresponding to the set of distinct eigenvalues : @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , the set of eigenvalues are uniquely determined by the polynomial invariants of @xmath12 via its characteristic equation .",
    "the characteristic equation , when solved , gives us the set of eigenvalues , and hence these are consequently determined by the invariants .",
    "we can now define a number of associated curvature operators .",
    "for example , for an eigenvector @xmath68 so that @xmath69 , we can construct the annihilator operator : @xmath70 considering the jordan block form of @xmath12 , the eigenvalue @xmath71 corresponds to a set of jordan blocks .",
    "these blocks are of the form : @xmath72 there might be several such blocks corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath73 ; however , they are all such that @xmath74 is nilpotent and hence there exists an @xmath75 such that @xmath76 annihilates the whole vector space associated with the eigenvalue @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that we can define a set of operators @xmath77 with eigenvalues @xmath78 or @xmath79 by considering the products @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( as long as @xmath82 for all @xmath83 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can now define @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a _",
    "curvature projector_. the set of all such curvature projectors obeys : = _ 1+_2++_a+ , _",
    "we can use these curvature projectors to decompose the operator @xmath12 : = n+_a_a_a .",
    "[ decomp ] the operator @xmath86 thus contains all the information not encapsulated in the eigenvalues @xmath73 . from the jordan form",
    "we can see that @xmath86 is nilpotent ; i.e. , there exists an @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath89 , then @xmath86 is a negative / positive boost weight operator which can be used to lower / raise the boost weight of a tensor @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xmath90 consequently , we have the orthogonal decomposition : = _ a(n_a+_a_a ) .",
    "[ decomp2 ] note that we can achieve this decomposition by just using operators and their invariants .    in linear algebra",
    "we are accustomed to the concept of diagonalisable matrices .",
    "similarly , we will call an operator _ diagonalisable _ if =",
    "[ tdiag ]    in differential geometry we are particularly interested in quantities like the riemann curvature tensor , @xmath3 .",
    "now , the riemann tensor naturally defines two curvature operators : namely , the ricci operator @xmath91 , and the weyl operator @xmath55 .",
    "let us , at a point @xmath1 , define the tensor algebra ( or tensor concomitants ) of 0th order curvature operators , @xmath13 , refers to the riemann tensor and index @xmath78 refers to the number of covariant derivatives .",
    "] as follows :    the set @xmath92 is a @xmath93-linear space of operators ( endomorphisms ) which satisfies the following properties :    1 .",
    "identity : the metric tensor , as an operator , is in @xmath13 .",
    "the riemann tensor , as an operator , is in @xmath13 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath94 , then any tensor contraction and any eigenvalue of @xmath12 is also in @xmath13 .",
    "`` square roots '' : if @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( as tensors ) where @xmath29 is of even rank , then @xmath97 5 .",
    "any operator that can be considered as a tensor product or expressible as functions of elements in @xmath13 is also in @xmath13 .",
    "an element of @xmath13 , will be referred to as a _ curvature operator of order 0_.    similarly , allowing for contractions of the covariant derivative of the riemann tensor , @xmath98 , we can define the tensor algebra of 1st order curvature operators , @xmath99 , etc .",
    "if we allow for arbitrary number of derivatives , we will simply call it @xmath100 . hence - linear vector space",
    ", @xmath101 will be finite dimensional , while @xmath100 is infinite dimensional .",
    "however , in practice , it is sufficient to consider @xmath101 for sufficiently large @xmath102 due to the fact that a finite number of derivatives of the riemann tensor are sufficient to determine the spacetime up to isometry . ] : @xmath103 for example , the following tensor : @xmath104 is a curvature tensor of order 2 and is consequently an element of @xmath105 .    of particular interest",
    "is when all curvature operators can be determined using their invariants .",
    "this means that there is preferred set of operators ( namely the projectors ) which acts as a basis for the curvature operators .",
    "this is related to diagonalisability of operators , and hence :    @xmath101 is called diagonalisable if there exists a set of projectors @xmath106 forming a tensor basis for @xmath101 ; i.e. , for every @xmath107 , @xmath108    note that the components may be complex . if an operator is diagonalisable , we can , by solving the characteristic equation , determine the expansion eq .",
    "( [ tdiag ] ) .",
    "this enables us to reconstruct the operator itself . in this sense",
    ", the operator would be characterised by its invariants .",
    "hence , we have the following definition :    [ def : char ] a space @xmath17 is said to be _ characterised by its invariants _ iff , for every @xmath109 , the set of curvature operators , @xmath100 , is diagonalisable ( over @xmath110 ) .",
    "as pointed out earlier we can further subdivide this category into spaces that are characterised by their invariants in a strong or weak sense .",
    "if , in addition , the space @xmath17 is @xmath0-non - degenerate , then the space is characterised by its invariants in the _ strong _ sense ; otherwise its said to be characterised by its invariants in the _ weak _ sense .    a word of caution : note that even though we know all the operators of a spacetime that is characterised by its invariants , we do not necessarily know the frame . in particular , by raising an index of the metric tensor , @xmath28 , we get , irrespective of the signature , @xmath111 .",
    "this means that for a lorentzian spacetime we would lose the information of which direction is time .",
    "however , there might still be ways of determining which is time by inspection of the invariants ( but this is no guarantee ) .",
    "if , say , an invariant can be written as @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , then clearly , @xmath114 is timelike and , consequently , can be used as time . on the other hand , an example of",
    "when this can not be done is the following case , in @xmath115 dimensions , when the only non - zero invariants are the 0th order ricci invariants : @xmath116 then , if this spacetime is characterised by its invariants , we get : @xmath117 however , there is no information in the invariants if the direction associated with the @xmath78 eigenvalue is a space - like or time - like direction .",
    "consequently , in the definition above we have to keep in mind that these spacetimes are characterised by their invariants , up to a possible ambiguity in which direction is associated with time , and which is space .    in the following",
    "we will reserve the word `` spacetime '' to the lorentzian - signature case , while `` riemannian '' ( space ) will correspond to the euclidean signature case . for the riemannian case , the operators provide us with an extremely simple proof of the following theorem :    [ thm : riemannian ] a riemannian space is always characterised by its invariants .    in an orthonormal frame ,",
    "the riemannian metric is @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the components of an operator @xmath37 will be the same as those of @xmath119 , possibly up to an overall constant .",
    "therefore , let us decompose into the symmetric , @xmath120 , and antisymmetric part @xmath121 , of @xmath119 : @xmath122}.\\ ] ] since the signature is euclidean , the operators @xmath123 and @xmath124 will also be symmetric and antisymmetric ( as matrices ) , respectively .",
    "a standard result is that we can consequently always diagonalise @xmath125 : = ( _ 1,_2,,_n ) ; i.e. , the operator @xmath125 is diagonalisable . for @xmath126 :",
    "=(    0 & a_1 + -a_1 & 0    ,    0 & a_2 + -a_2 & 0    , ,    0 & a_k + -a_k & 0    , 0 , , 0 ) consequently , @xmath126 is diagonalisable also ( with purely imaginary eigenvalues ) .",
    "so for @xmath127 , then also @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and therefore any curvature operator is characterised by its invariants .",
    "this proves the theorem .    we note that this theorem also follows from a group - theoretical perspective @xcite",
    "; however , the operators provide an alternative ( and fairly straight - forward ) proof .",
    "of course , it is known that a lorentzian spacetime is not necessarily characterised by its invariants in any dimension .",
    "it can be seen that what goes wrong is that @xmath120 and @xmath121 are not necessarily symmetric or antisymmetric as operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the jacobi canonical forms are really needed in this case .",
    "] however , the spacetimes being characterised by their curvature invariants play a special role for certain classes of metrics .",
    "for example , we have that :    among the spacetimes of vanishing scalar curvature invariants ( vsi ) , the only spacetimes being characterised by their curvature invariants ( weakly or strongly ) are locally isometric to flat space .    note that flat space is a characterised by its invariants only in the weak sense",
    ".    if a spacetime has constant scalar curvature invariants ( csi ) and is characterised by its invariants ( weakly or strongly ) , then it is a locally homogeneous space .",
    "these locally homogeneous spacetimes can be characterised by their invariants in either a weak or strong sense .",
    "regarding the question of which spacetimes are characterised by its invariants , in the sense defined above , we have that the following conjecture is true :    if a spacetime is characterised by its invariants ( weakly or strongly ) , then it is either @xmath0-non - degenerate , or of type d to all orders ; i.e. , type d@xmath132 .",
    "there are several results that support this conjecture .",
    "first , it seems reasonable that all @xmath0-non - degenerate metrics are ( strongly ) characterised by their invariants . in 4 dimensions ,",
    "this seems clear from the results of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , that type d@xmath132 spacetimes are also characterised by its invariants ( in a weak sense necessarily ) follows from the results of @xcite .",
    "however , it remains to prove that these are all .",
    "we should also point out a sublety in the definition of what we mean by characterised by the invariants .",
    "now a class of metrics that , in general , does not seem to be characterised by their curvature invariants is the subclass of kundt metrics @xcite : @xmath133+g_{ij}(u , x^k)\\d",

    "however , the projection operators are frame independent operators so let us find the various projectors in this case . since @xmath145 has multiplicity 2 , ( while @xmath146 has multiplicity 1 ) the operator @xmath147 must be proportional to the projection operator @xmath148 . by ordinary matrix multiplication",

    "however , in general , this metric will be of segre type @xmath160 ; therefore , even if @xmath161 , this metric will not be determined by the curvature invariants , as defined above .",
    "since all of the results so far are entirely point - wise , it is also an advantage to consider the operator calculus ; i.e. derivatives of operators .",

    "the walker metrics can be written as [ walker ] s^2=2u(v+h_1u+wx)+2x(y+h_2x+wu ) , where @xmath350 , @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",

    "we note that if both @xmath29 and @xmath42 possess the @xmath359-property , then so does @xmath361 since the resulting boost weights can be considered as `` vector addition '' in @xmath360 .",
