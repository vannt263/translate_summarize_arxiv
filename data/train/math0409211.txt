    "this work has led to some very nice enumerative results ; see for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that nothing has been said about the tutte polynomial of a hyperplane arrangement .",
    "graphs and matroids have a tutte polynomial associated with them , which generalizes the characteristic polynomial , and arises very naturally in numerous enumerative problems in both areas .",
    "many interesting invariants of graphs and matroids can be computed immediately from this polynomial .",

    "this paper is devoted to purely enumerative questions .",
    "we are particularly interested in computing the tutte polynomials of specific arrangements .",
    "we address the matroid - theoretic aspects of this investigation in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : arrangements ] we introduce the basic notions of hyperplane arrangements that we will need . in section [ sec : comptutte ] we define the tutte polynomial of a hyperplane arrangement , and we present a finite field method for computing it .",
    "this is done in terms of the coboundary polynomial , a simple transformation of the tutte polynomial .",
    "we recover several known results about the characteristic and tutte polynomials of graphs and representable matroids , and derive other consequences of this method . finally , in section [ sec : comp ] , we compute the tutte polynomials of several families of arrangements .",
    "in particular , for deformations of the braid arrangement , we relate the computation of tutte polynomials to the enumeration of classical combinatorial objects . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain several purely enumerative results about objects such as labeled trees , dyck paths , alternating trees and semiorders .",
    "in this section we recall some of the basic concepts of hyperplane arrangements . for a more thorough introduction ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "given a field @xmath9 and a positive integer @xmath10 , an _ affine hyperplane _ in @xmath11 is an @xmath12-dimensional affine subspace of @xmath11 .",
    "if we fix a system of coordinates @xmath13 on @xmath11 , a hyperplane can be seen as the set of points that satisfy a certain equation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and not all @xmath16 s are equal to @xmath17 .",
    "a _ hyperplane arrangement _ @xmath1 in @xmath11 is a finite set of affine hyperplanes of @xmath11 .",
    "we will refer to hyperplane arrangements simply as _ arrangements_. we will assume for simplicity that @xmath18 unless explicitly stated , although most of our results extend immediately to any field of characteristic zero .",
    "we will say that an arrangement @xmath1 is _ central _ if the hyperplanes in @xmath1 have a non - empty intersection .",
    "similarly , we will say that a subset ( or _ subarrangement _ ) @xmath19 of hyperplanes is _ central _ if the hyperplanes in @xmath20 have a non - empty intersection .    the _ rank function _",
    "@xmath21 is defined for each central subset @xmath20 by @xmath22 .",
    "this function can be extended to a function @xmath23 , by defining the rank of a non - central subset @xmath20 to be the largest rank of a central subset of @xmath20 .",
    "the _ rank _ of @xmath1 is @xmath24 , and it is denoted @xmath21 .    alternatively , if the hyperplane @xmath25 has defining equation @xmath26 , associate its normal vector @xmath27 to it . then define @xmath28 to be the dimension of the span of the corresponding vectors @xmath29 in @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that these two definitions of the rank function agree . in particular",
    ", this means that the resulting function @xmath23 is the rank function of a matroid .",
    "we will usually omit the subscripts when the underlying arrangement is clear , and simply write @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath21 , respectively . to the rank function of a matroid ; for more information , see @xcite . ]    the rank function gives us natural definitions of the usual concepts of matroid theory , such as independent sets , bases , closed sets , and circuits , in the context of hyperplane arrangements .",
    "all of this is done more naturally in the broader context of semimatroids in @xcite .    to each hyperplane arrangement @xmath1",
    "we assign a partially ordered set , called the _ intersection poset _ of @xmath1 and denoted @xmath33 .",

    "the arrangement @xmath43 ( or simply @xmath44 ) , obtained by removing @xmath25 from the arrangement , is called the _ deletion of @xmath25 in @xmath1_. it is an arrangement in @xmath2 . the arrangement @xmath45 , consisting of the intersections of the other hyperplanes with @xmath25 , is called the _ contraction of @xmath25 in @xmath1_. it is an arrangement in @xmath25 .",
    "notice , however , that some technical difficulties can arise . in a hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 ,",
    "contracting a hyperplane @xmath25 may give us repeated hyperplanes @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the arrangement @xmath48 .",

    "the hyperplane @xmath47 of @xmath48 becomes the `` hyperplane '' @xmath50 in the  arrangement \" @xmath49 .",
    "this is not a hyperplane in @xmath46 , though .",
    "therefore , the class of hyperplane arrangements , as we defined it , is not closed under deletion and contraction .",
    "this is problematic when we want to mirror matroid - theoretic results in this context .",
    "there is an artificial solution to this problem : we can consider multisets @xmath51 of subspaces of vector spaces @xmath52 , where each @xmath53 has dimension @xmath54 or @xmath55 . in other words , we allow repeated hyperplanes , and we allow the full space @xmath52 to be regarded as a  hyperplane \" , mirroring a loop of a matroid .",
    "this class of objects _ is _ closed under deletion and contraction , but it is somewhat awkward to work with .",
    "a better solution is to think of arrangements as members of the class of semimatroids ; a class that _ is _ closed under deletion and contraction , and is more natural matroid - theoretically .",

    "he used this method to compute explicitly the characteristic polynomial of several families of hyperplane arrangements , obtaining very nice enumerative results .",
