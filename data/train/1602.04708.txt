    "the phenomenon of magnetic flux penetration into superconductors has longstanding scientific tradition .",
    "the physics of this phenomenon in type ii superconductors , for the magnetic field parallel to the sample surface , is simple . for magnetic fields below @xmath2 ( in the meissner state )",
    "the fields are totally expelled from the sample . whereas above @xmath2 the flux penetrates via abrikosov vortices .",
    "however in real superconductors , due to defects the vortex distribution is not uniform and in this case the vortex lattice is in a metastable state .",
    "the metastable states of the vortices are the cause of numerous physical phenomena such as : flux creep , magnetic relaxation  @xcite and vortex avalanches , see review by altshuler and johansen and references therein  @xcite .",
    "the explanation of the vortex avalanches was given mainly in the framework of two models : thermomagnetic instabilities @xcite and self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "the avalanche - like penetration of magnetic flux into a type ii superconductor was studied by numerous experimental methods .",
    "the most popular methods are magneto - optical imaging , micro - hall - probe and pick - up coil experiments  @xcite .",
    "subsequently in this paper we will focus mainly on experiments with a pick - up coil .",
    "the first pick - up coil experiments were carried out more than 50 years ago  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "voltage spikes that were induced in the pick - up coil by the magnetic moment jumps caused by a swept field were measured .",
    "the magnetic moment jumps at high field sweep rate , up to 1 koe / s , were accompanied by increasing the sample temperature due to fast motion of the vortex bundles @xcite .",
    "thermomagnetic instabilities are the cause of such heating @xcite . however , at low sweep rates , the heating produced by a flux jump did not play a significant role @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed avalanche size distribution , which indicates the number of vortices in a moving bundle , is an exponential @xcite or a power - law @xcite function of the avalanche size .",
    "the latter was used as a confirmation of soc model .",
    "it was demonstrated that the magnetic flux penetrates into the interior of the cylinder in two fashions .",
    "the first one is a smooth flux flow and the second one is jump like .",
    "contribution of a smooth flow was about 97% of the total penetrated flux @xcite .",
    "experiments reported in @xcite were performed on hollow cylinders with large wall thickness @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a wall thickness and @xmath5 is the london penetration depth . in this case , as expected , avalanches were detected in magnetic fields higher than @xmath2 , ei.e . in a mixed state . at the same time",
    ", we have shown that for a thin - walled cylinders of nb , @xmath6 , an `` avalanche''-like magnetic flux penetration occurs not only in magnetic fields higher but in * lower * than @xmath2 of the film itself , i.e. in the vortex free regime @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon is very interesting , and the physical reasons for it are not yet clear .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive experimental study of the dynamics of magnetic flux penetration into thin - walled superconducting nb cylinders .",
    "the magnetic field penetrates through the walls of the cylinder in a series of giant jumps with magnetic field amplitude 10 - 20 oe and duration of a few microseconds .",
    "we have shown that magnetic field inside the cylinder exhibits several oscillations in each jump .",
    "the jumps take place when the total current in the wall , not the current density , exceeds some critical value .",
    "the giant jumps were observed in fields below and above @xmath2 of the nb film itself .",
    "in addition to the avalanche - like penetration there is a smooth penetration and its contribution can reach about 20 % of the total penetrated flux .",
