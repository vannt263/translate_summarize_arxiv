    "a cellular automaton ( ca ) is a discrete dynamical system which consists of an array of a number of cells .",
    "each cell allows for finitely many states which change into new states in discrete time .",
    "usually the rule of time evolution with which the system is equipped is quite simple , and ca are often investigated as simple models for natural or social phenomena .",
    "the box - ball system ( bbs ) is one type of ca , represented by finitely many balls and countably many boxes arranged in a line .    in this paper , we study a periodic box - ball system ( pbbs ) , which is a bbs with a periodic boundary condition",
    ". the pbbs is closely related to integrable nonlinear equations . in fact , the pbbs has soliton - like solutions and a large number of conserved quantities .",
    "moreover , the pbbs can be obtained from integrable equations by the method of ` @xmath0discretization ' .",
    "this relation gives us a new method to describe the behaviour of a pbbs .",
    "if the initial - value problem of integrable equations related to the pbbs is solvable by some analytical method , the initial - value problem of pbbs itself is also solvable , as the solution of pbbs is obtained from the solution of the integrable equations by ultradiscretization .",

    "let @xmath2 be the total number of balls , such that @xmath3 .",
    "each of these boxes is either empty or is filled with a ball . since we are interested in the periodic case , the @xmath4-th box is adjacent to the first box .",
    "the time evolution of this system is :    1 .   in each filled box , create a copy of the ball .",
    "2 .   move all copies once according to the following rules .",
