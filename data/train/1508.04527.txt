    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are objects that show x - ray pulsations but , in comparison to the more luminous accreting pulsars in x - ray binaries , they exhibit several unusual properties ( e.g. no evidence for a companion star , softer x - ray spectra than accreting pulsars ) . soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) on the other hand are sources that produce short ( @xmath5sec , typically @xmath6s ) bursts with luminosities up to @xmath7 in low - energy @xmath0-rays and x - rays .",
    "they also exhibit rare , giant flares with luminosities up to @xmath8 , as well as low - luminosity ( @xmath9 ) persistent emission ( e.g. woods & thompson 2006 ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that sgrs and axps are manifestations of the same class of objects ( e.g. kouveliotou 1998 ; woods & thompson 2006 ) which , in addition to the bursting activity , share some general common characteristics .",
    "these common traits include : low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath10 ) , but significant hard x - ray emission ( e.g. meregheti 2008 ; enoto 2010 ) , relatively long periods ( p@xmath11s ) , and large spin - down rates ( @xmath12 ) ( e.g. woods & thompson 2006 ) .",
    "these properties have been generally interpreted within the context of the magnetar model ( e.g. duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ; beloborodov 2013 ) . according to this model , axps",
    "are together with sgrs , two manifestations of non - accreting young pulsars with ultra - strong magnetic fields in the @xmath13 g range ( e.g. woods & thompson 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the persistent emission of magnetars is believed to be due to the decay of their strong magnetic field , while their outbursts are interpreted as violent magnetic reconnection events due to the rearrangement of plates on the crust of the pulsar .",
    "the ultra - strong magnetic field of these systems is inferred from their spin decay .",
    "however , recently several members of the axp / sgr family have been found to have dipole magnetic fields ( as derived from their @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) in the more typical range of @xmath16 g for accreting pulsars ( e.g. rea 2014 ; rea 2013 ) . this has led to the notion that the activity of these objects is powered by an internal toroidal field , which also leads to the formation of local multipole fields .",
    "although the magnetar model explains the energy output and the outbursts of axps and sgrs , their broad - band x - ray spectra are usually described on the basis of ad - hoc phenomenological models such as combination of power - law components ( e.g. meregheti 2008 ; den hartog 2008a , 2008b ; enoto 2010 ) .",
    "however , so far there has not been any physical model that reproduces consistently the entire broad - band x - ray spectra of axps / sgrs . for example",
    ", beloborodov ( 2013 ) proposed a spectral model based on the outflow of @xmath17 pairs produced close to the surface of the neutron star , and it was recently applied to the spectra of 3 axps / sgrs ( hascot 2014 ) , providing a good description of their hard x - ray spectra , but requiring the ad - hoc inclusion of multiple modified black - body components to fit the spectrum below 10kev . on the other hand the `` twisted magnetosphere '' model of zane ( 2009 ) , while it fits well the spectrum below 10kev , it requires an additional power - law component to reproduce the hard part of the spectrum .    an alternative model to that of an isolated spinning - down magnetar is that of a newborn pulsar with a magnetic dipole field ( @xmath18 g ) , accreting leftover gas either from the common - envelope phase ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ) , or from the fall - back disk of its parent supernova explosion ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ; alpar 2001 ) . in this case",
    ", the spin down of the neutron star is attributed to the interaction between the accretion disk and the magnetosphere ( e.g. ertan 2012 ) .",
    "owing to the low luminosities , the accretion rate of these systems is expected to be much lower than that of typical accreting pulsars in x - ray binaries .",
    "in addition , given their low luminosity and lack of donor stars , we would not expect to observe strong optical emission from these systems , in agreement with the general characteristics of the axp / sgr population . in this context , small scale outbursts observed in axps / sgrs can be easily explained in terms of accretion of clumps in the fall - back disk . on the other hand ,",
    "large outbursts are explained in the context of reconnection of local multipole magnetic fields anchored on the surface of the neutron star . in general",
    "this `` accretion model '' reproduces well the spin period distribution , light curves , and broad - band multi - wavelength emission of axps and sgrs ( e.g. ertan 2007 ; alikan & ertan , 2012 ) .",
    "the discovery of hard x - ray emission from axps / sgrs extending up to @xmath19kev ( e.g. kuiper 2004 , 2006 ; den hartog 2008 ; enoto 2010 ) , gives us an additional test - bed for the fall - back disk model .",
    "in the first of a series of papers exploring the consistency of the hard x - ray emission from axps / sgrs with the `` accretion model '' ( trmper 2010 ) , we found that indeed the hard x - ray spectra of the brightest axp , 4u 0142 + 61 , can be interpreted in terms of accretion .",
    "the and integral spectrum of this source can be well represented by a model including thermal as well as bulk - motion comptonization ( bmc model ; e.g. mastichiadis & kylafis 1992 ; titarchuk 2007 ) .",
    "a follow - up study of the energy - dependent pulse profiles of the same source ( trmper 2013 ) showed that they can be well modeled in the context of the fan beam from the accretion column , and a polar beam from the hot polar cap .",
    "more recently , guo ( 2015 ) analyzed a sample of 4 axps / sgrs with the same spectral model as in trmper ( 2010 ) .",
    "they found that the hard x - ray spectra of these 4 additional sources can also be well reproduced with the bmc model , further supporting the accretion model for axps .",
    "however , the spectral models used in the studies of trmper ( 2010 ) and guo ( 2015 ) have several shortcomings when applied to accreting pulsars : they assume spherical or disk geometries , instead of the cylindrical geometry of the accretion flow onto a pulsar , and they do not account for the different scattering cross - sections in the presence of a strong magnetic field . in order to further explore the consistency of the fall - back disk model with the x - ray spectra of axps and sgrs we embarked on a systematic study of their broad - band x - ray spectra , taking advantage of the current generation of hard x - ray telescopes ( and ) , and employing the best available spectral models for the x - ray spectra from the accretion flow onto an accreting pulsar . in this paper",
    "we present the spectral analysis of the 0.5200kev spectra of 5 axps / sgrs with spectral models appropriate for modeling the accretion flow onto a pulsar .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  2 we present the sample and data used in this study ; in  3 we describe the analysis of these data , and the results from the analysis of the x - ray spectra ; and in  4 we discuss the implications of our results for the accretion model of pulsars .",
    "finally in  5 we summarize our findings .",
    "all quoted errors correspond to the 90% confidence limit for one interesting parameter .",
    "in order to obtain useful constraints on the x - ray spectral properties of axps / sgrs we selected to study objects from the list of known axps / sgrs with available x - ray spectra above 10.0 kev ( e.g. mereghetti 2008 ; enoto 2010 ) .",
    "we searched the  ( mitsuda 2007 ) and integral ( winkler 2003 ) archives for available data .",
    "we found 5 objects with good quality spectra above 10kev .",
    "these are listed in table [ t_sample ] along with the basic information of the observations used in this study .",
    "one additional object with known hard x - ray emission ( sgr1806 - 20 ) was excluded from our analysis because it is near the galactic center and its hard x - ray emission might be significantly contaminated by the galactic ridge emission ( krivonos 2007 ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath20 the adopted distances are from olausen & kaspi , 2014 .",
    "+ @xmath21 the radius of the polar cap for 4u 0142 + 61 and 1rxs j1708 - 4009 is based on the best - fit normalization and black - body temperature of the model and it is likely overestimated since this model may also account for some emission produced in the accretion flow .    in the cases of 4u 0142 + 61 and 1rxs j1708 - 4009 , the spectral fit requires an additional thermal comptonization model , which we attribute to either the accretion flow below the shock or comptonization of photons from the polar cap by electrons at its atmosphere ( c.f .",
    "ferrigno 2009 ) .",
    "the low temperature of the seed photons ( @xmath22kev ) and comptonizing electrons ( @xmath23kev ) suggests that the comptonization does not take place in the accretion flow ( in contrast the electron temperature in the accretion flow is @xmath24kev ) .",
    "however , we can not rule out a contribution from the accretion flow .",
    "the analysis presented in  3 shows that this model can describe very well the broad - band ( 0.5 - 200 kev ) x - ray spectra of axps and sgrs , indicating that they could be produced from an accretion flow onto the pulsar .",
    "the spectral fits show that the temperature of the thermal emission from the polar cap is @xmath25kev .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath26 higher than the typical temperatures of `` normal '' pulsars , but it is consistent with the polar cap temperature of other axps ( e.g. aguilera 2008 ) , and could be understood in terms of heating of the polar cap by the fan beam ( trmper 2013 ) .      from the best - fit model parameters we can derive some basic information about the physical conditions in the accretion column .",
    "since the energy released is gravitational , we have that the mass accretion rate is given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the luminosity of the emitted radiation , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the radius and the mass of the neutron star respectively , and @xmath31 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the mass accretion rates estimated from the luminosities listed in table [ t_lum ] and assuming a neutron - star mass @xmath32 and radius @xmath33 are presented in table [ t_phys_param ] .",
    "they are all in the range @xmath34 , which is @xmath35 times lower than the accretion rates of typical accreting pulsars .",
    "they are also in good agreement with the fall - back disk model which predicts accretion rates of @xmath36 for @xmath37yr after the supernova explosion ( e.g. ertan 2009 ) .",
    "the radius of the accretion column resulting form the spectral fits is generally between 160 - 330 m . assuming that the accreted material is captured between the alfvn radius and the co - rotation radius , kylafis ( 2014 ) calculated that the radius of the accretion column is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the dipole magnetic field of the pulsar in units of @xmath42 g . for the accretion rates given in table [ t_phys_param ] and a magnetic field of @xmath43 g",
    ", the above formula gives accretion column radii in excellent agreement with those estimated from the spectral fits .",
    "key for the formation of the part of the spectrum extending above 10kev is , as discussed in  3.1 , a transverse optical depth of at least @xmath44 . from the continuity equation",
    "we have that the electron density @xmath45 at a given distance @xmath46 from the center of the neutron star is ( c.f .",
    "43 of f12 ) :",
    "@xmath47    where @xmath48 is the mass infall rate , @xmath49 is the velocity of the accretion flow at distance from the neutron star center @xmath46 , @xmath50 is the radius of the accretion column , and @xmath51 is the proton mass .    using the velocity profile given in eq .",
    "[ eq : vel ] , the above equation becomes    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the speed of light , @xmath54 is the velocity ( in terms of the speed of light ) at the surface of the neutron star ( distance from the center of the neutron star @xmath29 ) , and @xmath55 is the exponent of the velocity profile ( in our case fixed to @xmath56 ) .    then the transverse optical depth at distance @xmath46 is @xmath57    based on the best - fit parameters given in table [ t_sp_fits ] , we find that the transverse optical depths at the base of the accretion column are @xmath44 ( table [ t_phys_param ] ) .",
    "kylafis ( 2014 ) demonstrated that even in such relatively low optical depths , thermal and bulk - motion comptonization can produce a hard spectrum with a photon index @xmath58 extending up to @xmath59kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the best - fit thompson vertical optical depth along the accretion flow is typically @xmath60 .",
    "although the accretion column model provides good fits to the spectra of the 5 axps / sgrs studied in this work , some of the model parameters take unphysical values .",
    "the two most extreme examples are the magnitude of the velocity , in units of the velocity of light , that the gas in the accretion flow would aquire at the neutron star surface ( @xmath61 ) , which reaches unity if left as a free parameter , and the electron temperature in the accretion flow ( @xmath62 ) , which is much lower than 1kev ( tables [ t_sp_fits ] , [ t:4u0142_fit ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the spectral model produces the high - energy photons only through the bulk - motion comptonization mechanism , while the contribution of thermal comptonization is negligible , even when the energy available through the bulk - motion comptonization mechanism is not sufficient to produce the hard x - ray photons ( as in the case when @xmath61 was fixed to a lower value ; see  3 ) .",
    "this behavior could be the result of the following factors :    \\(a ) the seed photon spectrum assumed in the f12 model is a blackbody produced at the base of the accretion column , and it ignores the contribution of the bremsstrahlung radiation produced by the electrons below the shock .",
    "in fact , the f12 model does not take into account at all the flow below the radiative shock , but instead assumes that the accretion flow ( above the shock ) has a uniform temperature @xmath63 . for consistency ,",
    "the model ought to take into account the bremsstrahlung radiation that is produced from the electrons in the accretion flow ( above the shock ) , where the same electrons upscatter the produced photons , thus self - consistently linking the observed spectrum below @xmath64kev with the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "since a bremsstrahlung component would contribute in terms of a harder seed spectrum , the required contribution of bulk - motion comptonization would be reduced resulting in more realistic values for the terminal velocity of the accretion flow .",
    "\\(b ) the electron temperature is decoupled from the parameters of the accretion flow . in a more realistic scenario",
    "one would expect that the same electrons that are participating in the bulk - motion above the shock are also responsible for the thermal comptonization below the shock ( lyubarskii & sunyaev 1982 ; kylafis 2014 ) , resulting in much higher electron temperatures and harder comptonized spectra , reducing the need to interpret the entire hard spectrum through bulk - motion comptonization .",
    "\\(c ) the mass accretion rate estimated through eq .",
    "( 3 ) assumes isotropic emission , which obviously would be inappropriate if beaming effects are coming into play . in their study of the energy",
    "dependent pulse - profiles of 4u 0142 + 61 , the brightest axp , trmper ( 2013 ) estimate a luminosity for the fan beam of @xmath65 , and for the polar beam @xmath66 , resulting in a total luminosity of @xmath67 in the 0.8 - 160kev energy range .",
    "this is @xmath68% lower than the luminosity estimated from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , indicating that the neglect of beaming effects may significantly overestimate the accretion rate , and subsequently any parameters depending on them ( e.g. optical depth ) .    nonetheless , this model is the best available spectral model for the accretion flow in an accreting pulsar , and it provides a good representation of the observed spectra .",
    "improved models addressing the above limitations would help to obtain more precise information for the parameters of the accretion flow , but they should not change the general picture presented here .",
    "the debate regarding the interpretation of the quiescent emission of axps and sgrs as magnetars would largely benefit from the measurement of their dipole megnetic field strengths from cyclotron lines .",
    "for example , more sensitive observations of 1e 1841 - 04 , which show evidence for an absorption feature at the @xmath69 level ( an 2013 ) , can give insights into their nature by comparing their spectral and timing properties with those expected from different models .",
    "in addition , recently , tiengo ( 2013 ) reported an inferred magnetic field of @xmath70 g in sgr 0418 + 5729 assuming a proton cyclotron line , which is interpreted as a multipole magnetic field ; on the other hand , if an electron cyclotron line is assumed , the strength of the magnetic field is closer to @xmath71 g .",
    "the fact that the broad - band x - ray spectra of five axps / sgrs with hard x - ray emission can be well reproduced by an accretion flow model onto a pulsar , and the resulting parameters are consistent with those expected from the fall - back disk model , despite the limitations of the spectral models , gives further support to the fall - back disk model .",
    "furthermore , fits with the original version of the bw07 model , which includes bremsstrahlung seed photons ( but has strong correlations and degeneracies between the model parameters ) also provide an equally good description to the spectral data .",
    "trmper ( 2013 ) find that the energy - dependent pulse profiles of the brightest axp , 4u 0142 + 61 , can be explained by the emission of a fan beam originating in the accretion shock and a polar beam from the polar cap .",
    "the latter is produced by the illumination of the polar cap by the fan beam , which is subject to gravitational bending towards the neutron - star surface .",
    "this model allows us to determine the inclination of the spin axis with respect to the line - of - sight ( @xmath72 ) , the angle between the magnetic and spin axes ( @xmath73 ) , and the height of the accretion shock from the neutron star surface ( @xmath74 km , corresponding to @xmath75 km from the neutron star center ) .",
    "the combination of the constraints from the timing analysis , with the results from the energy spectra presented in this work , provide support to the accretion model for axps / sgrs from two independent , but complementary perspectives .",
    "development of more sophisticated spectral models for the accretion flow as well as modeling of the phase resolved spectra ( e.g. trmper 2013 ) for all sources with good quality hard x - ray spectra will allow us to further test the fall - back disk model for this class of objects and better constrain the parameters of the accretion flow .",
    "our main conclusions are enumerated below .    1 .",
    "we presented a systematic analysis of the x - ray spectra of 5 axps / sgrs .",
    "we fitted their  and  data with the spectral model of f12 for the radiation from material infaling onto a pulsar through an accretion column .",
    "we found that this model gives good fits to the observed broad band ( 0.5 - 200 kev ) spectra , supporting the fall - back disk model .",
    "2 .    we measured accretion rates in the @xmath76 range , also in agreement with the calculations of ertan ( 2009 ) .",
    "we found that the thompson optical depth along the accretion column is typically @xmath77 , while the transverse optical depth is @xmath78 .",
    "4 .    the radius of the accretion column is @xmath59 m , consistent with the estimation of kylafis ( 2014 ) for the fall - back disk model .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with the independent constraints on the x - ray beaming accretion flow geometry from the analysis of the energy - dependent pulse profiles ( trmper 2013 ) .",
    "6 .    in general ,",
    "these results show that the observed broad - band x - ray spectra of axps and sgrs showing significant x - ray emission above 10kev are consistent with the fall - back disk model .",
