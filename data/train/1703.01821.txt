    "eit is a non - invasive real - time functional imaging modality for the continuous monitoring of physiological functions such as lung ventilation and perfusion .",
    "the image contrast represents the time change of the electrical conductivity distribution inside the human body . using an array of surface electrodes around a chosen imaging slice ,",
    "the imaging device probes the internal conductivity distribution by injecting electrical currents at tens or hundreds of khz .",
    "the injected currents ( at safe levels ) produce distributions of electric potentials that are non - invasively measured from the attached surface electrodes .",
    "a portable eit system can provide functional images with an excellent temporal resolution of tens of frames per second .",
    "eit was introduced in the late 1970s@xcite , likely motivated by the success of x - ray ct .",
    "numerous image reconstruction methods and experimental validations have demonstrated its feasibility@xcite and clinical trials have begun especially in lung ventilation imaging and pulmonary function testing@xcite .",
    "however , eit images often suffer from measurement noise and artifacts especially in clinical environments and there still exist needs for new image reconstruction algorithms to achieve both high image quality and robustness .    the volume conduction or lead field theory indicates that a local perturbation of the internal conductivity distribution alters the measured current  voltage or trans - impedance data , which provide core information for conductivity image reconstructions . the sensitivity of the data to conductivity changes varies significantly depending on the distance between the electrodes and the conductivity perturbation : the measured data are highly sensitive to conductivity changes near the current - injection electrodes , whereas the sensitivity drops rapidly as the distance increases@xcite",
    "in addition , the boundary geometry and the electrode configuration also significantly affect the measured boundary data .",
    "the sensitivity map between the measured data and the internal conductivity perturbation is the basis of the conductivity image reconstruction .",
    "a discretization of the imaging domain results in a sensitivity or jacobian matrix , which is inverted to produce a conductivity image .",
    "the major difficulty arises from this inversion process , because the matrix is severely ill - conditioned .",
    "conductivity image reconstruction in eit is , therefore , known to be a fundamentally ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "uncertainties in the body shape , body movements , and electrode positions are unavoidable in practice , and result in significant amounts of forward and inverse modeling errors .",
    "measurement noise and these modeling errors , therefore , may deteriorate the quality of reconstructed images .",
    "numerous image reconstruction algorithms have been developed to tackle this ill - posed inverse problem with data uncertainties@xcite . in the early 1980s , an eit version of the x - ray ct backprojection algorithm@xcite",
    "was developed based on a careful understanding of the ct idea .",
    "the one - step gauss - newton method@xcite is one of the widely used methods and often called the linearized sensitivity method .",
    "several direct methods were also developed : the layer stripping method@xcite recovered the conductivity distribution layer by layer , the d - bar method@xcite was motivated from the constructive uniqueness proof for the inverse conductivity problem@xcite , and the factorization method@xcite was originated as a shape reconstruction method in the inverse scattering problem@xcite .",
    "recently , the discrete cosine transform was adopted to reduce the number of unknowns of the inverse conductivity problem@xcite .",
    "there is an open source software package , called eidors , for forward and inverse modelings of eit@xcite .",
    "there are also novel theoretical results showing a unique identification of the conductivity distribution under the ideal model of eit@xcite .",
    "most common eit image reconstruction methods are based on some form of least - squares inversion , minimizing the difference between the measured data and computed data provided by a forward model .",
    "various regularization methods are adopted for the stable inversion of the ill - conditioned jacobian matrix .",
    "these regularized least - squares data - fitting approaches adjust the degree of regularization by using a parameter , controlling the trade - off between data fidelity and stability of reconstruction .",
    "their performances , therefore , depend on the choice of the parameter .    in this paper , we propose a new regularization method , which is designed to achieve satisfactory performances in terms of both fidelity and stability regardless of the choice of the regularization parameter . investigating the correlations among the column vectors of the jacobian matrix",
    ", we developed a new regularization method in which the structure of data fidelity is incorporated .",
    "we also developed a motion artifact removal filter , that can be applied to the data before image reconstructions , by using a sub - matrix of the jacobian matrix .",
    "after explaining the developed methods , we will describe experimental results showing that the proposed fidelity - embedded regularization ( fer ) method combined with the motion artifact removal filter provides stable image reconstructions with satisfactory image quality even for very large regularization parameter values , thereby making the method irrelevant to the choice of the parameter value .",
    "to explain the eit image reconstruction problem clearly and effectively , we restrict our description to the case of a 16-channel eit system for real - time time - difference imaging applications .",
    "the sixteen electrodes ( @xmath0 ) are attached around a chosen imaging slice , denoted by @xmath1 .",

    "inevitable discrepancies exist between the forward model output @xmath63 and the measured data @xmath51 due to modeling errors and measurement noise : the real background conductivity is not homogeneous , the boundary shape and electrode positions change with body movements and there always exist electronic noise and interferences .",
    "motion artifacts are inevitable in practice to produce errors in measured voltage data and deteriorate the quality of reconstructed images@xcite . to investigate how the motion artifacts influence the measured voltage data , we take time - derivative to both sides of assuming the domain @xmath1 varies with time .",

    "is commonly adopted to compute @xmath87 with a suitably chosen regularization parameter @xmath88 and regularization operator @xmath89 .",
    "such image reconstructions rely on the choice of @xmath88 ( often empirically determined ) and @xmath89 using _ a priori _ information , suffering from over- or under - regularization .",
    "we propose the fidelity - embedded regularization ( fer ) method : @xmath90 where the regularization operator @xmath91 is the diagonal matrix such that @xmath92    to explain the fer method , we closely examine the correlations among column vectors of the sensitivity matrix @xmath59 , described in fig .",
