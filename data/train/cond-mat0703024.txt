    "dissipation of this excess energy is one of the important issues in dry - sliding friction and lubrication @xcite .",
    "normally , the dissipation of mechanical energy is resulted in heating of parts in relative motion .",
    "sometimes , it gives rise to wear and failure due to overheating .",
    "in general , significant amounts of resources ( energy and material ) are lost in the course of friction .",
    "one of the prime goals of tribology is to minimize energy dissipation through lubrication .",
    "recently , several works have attempted to develop surfaces with superlow friction coefficients .",
    "the objective of this work is to develop an understanding of phononic energy dissipation during sliding friction , especially to shed some light on the dynamics of discharge of excited phonons of a nano - particle ( representing a lubricant molecule or an asperity ) deep into the substrate .",
    "this problem has many aspects and the solution will depend on a variety of physical parameters which can be grouped into major categories , such as internal degrees of freedom of the nano - particle , density of substrate phonon modes , the type and strength of coupling between the nano - particle and the substrate , and finally the initial temperatures of the nano - particle and the substrate . a reliable way of studying this problem is to carry out state - of - the - art molecular dynamics simulations by which one can obtain sample specific results . to explore the general features of the phononic dissipation ,",
    "however , we propose an hamiltonian treatment of the problem .",
    "since the number of physical ingredients determining the dynamics is considerably large , our strategy will be to focus on them separately .    in this work",
    ", we present our conclusions concerning the dependence of phononic dissipation on internal degrees of freedom of the nano - partcile and the substrate , namely on the properties of discrete and continuum densities of phonon modes of the nano - particle and the substrate .",
    "furthermore , we will consider two types of coupling between the finite and extended systems .",
    "the effect of initial temperatures of the parties , besides from the effect of temperature difference , is another major topic in its own and we leave that discussion to another paper . in the present paper , we consider the initial temperatures to be zero and limit our attention to the near - equilibrium case in the weak coupling regime .",
    "strong coupling regime and non - equilibrium cases will also be treated separately .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ section : model ] , we describe the physical model .",
    "the theoretical methods to be used are presented in section [ section : methods ] .",
    "these are the equation of motion ( eom ) technique which involves laplace transforms for the solution of the coupled differential equations for phonon operators , the fano - anderson ( fa ) method which is useful for diagonalizing quadratic hamiltonians , and green s function ( gf ) method by which we can incorporate the effect of multi - modes into the study .",
    "the applications of the given methods to different types of coupling and substrates having different densities of states will be presented and discussed in section [ section : applications ] .",
    "these are mainly the increase of decay rate with square of the coupling constant @xcite , the interaction - specific dependence of decay rate on the nano - particle mode frequencies and the effect of neighboring modes on decay rate of each other .",
    "results obtained by the above methods will also be discussed in connection to classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in section [ sec : md ] .",

    "we have omitted the constant terms as they do not contribute to the dynamics of the system .",

    "here we consider two types of coupling .",
    "the first one is lorentzian coupling in which the coupling coefficient @xmath13 is a lorentzian with its peak located at @xmath4 and has width @xmath15 .",
    "as long as the coupling between the nano - particle and the substrate is weak , @xmath13 will be a peaked function of @xmath14 and a separate peak will be present around each @xmath4 . depending on the strength of the interaction ,",
    "the sharpness of the peaks and the overlap between the neigboring peaks will differ .",
    "if the coupling is weak enough we may neglect the overlaps , namely @xmath16 we assume that the coupling terms of different modes of the nano - particle do not overlap , and hence we can treat each nano - particle mode separately .    for the second type of coupling , we consider the coupling coefficients which scale inversely as the square root of the product of the frequencies of the coupled modes , i.e. @xmath17 the coefficient @xmath18 stands for the strength of the coupling and will depend on the interaction between the nano - particle and the substrate .",

    "the time dependent occupation is again separable as contributions from the initial temperature of the nano - particle and that of the substrate .",

    "that is , each interaction point is the intersection of two phonon lines .",
    "since the interaction hamiltonian relates a nano - particle mode to a substrate mode only , each vertex contains one nano - particle phonon line and a substrate phonon line .",

    "in this section , we will apply the above methods to lorentzian and square - root coupling of nano - particles to substrates having 1d and 2d debye dos and discuss the dependence of decay rate on properties of coupling , and the internal parameters of the nano - particle and the substrate .",
    "the lowest vibrational frequency of a nano - particle increases as its size decreases . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "the width of the spectral function @xmath124 will be small compared to @xmath66 provided that @xmath4 is not close to zero , which is already satisfied for nano - particles . in this limit",
    ", the imaginary part of the self - energy can be interpreted as twice the decay rate , @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the dependence of decay rate on the interaction type and strength as well as on the frequency of the nano - particle can be obtained from the spectral function .    for the case of lorentzian coupling ,",
    "the interaction strength @xmath18 is linear with @xmath13 which shows that the decay rate increases with @xmath126 . if the coupling is a function of the separation between interacting atoms of the substrate and the nano - particle only , the coupling has the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sec : model : sqrt.coupling ] ) with @xmath18 being proportional to a spring constant @xmath127 connecting the interacting atoms . since the spectral function scales with @xmath126 , decay rate increases with @xmath128 for inverse - square - root coupling case .",
    "the @xmath128 law was previously obtained using elastic continuum model for phononic dissipation at physisorption systems @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the nano - particle mode frequency is a key issue we wish to emphasize in phononic energy dissipation . in lorentzian coupling case ,",
    "the decay rate is determined by the width of the lorentzian rather than the frequency . on the other hand , for inverse - square - root coupling ( cf .",
    "( [ eqn : sec : model : sqrt.coupling ] ) ) , it is inversely proportional to the nano - particle mode frequency @xmath4 .         and @xmath129 for both cases are almost the same .",
    "( b ) spectra of @xmath130 and @xmath131 get narrowed and distorted when single mode condition is relaxed . ]",
    "it is evident from equations ( [ dressed : mu_kare ] ) and ( [ eqn : green_spectral ] ) that phonons in mode @xmath4 decay faster as the substrate dos at the center of the peak , @xmath132 , increases .",
    "a crucial consequence of dependence on substrate dos is that , if the dos at the peak of the spectral function tends to zero , the spectral function ( and @xmath133 ) has the form of a @xmath71-function . in the language of dressed modes",
    ", this corresponds to a localized mode , i.e. it does not decay at all .",
    "such localized states are also known to occur in e.g. solid state physics @xcite and atomic physics @xcite . for weak coupling ,",
    "the real part of the self - energy is small , so the peak of the spectral function is not altered significantly from its original position @xmath4 . in other words , lying outside the continuum of substrate modes , it is unlikely to be shifted into the range where it can decay and vice versa .",
    "another important effect about dos dependence takes place when the spectral peak coincides with a van - hove singularity of the substrate dos , by which the decay rate is enhanced abruptly .",
    "we investigate the effect of a neighboring mode within square - root coupling in 1d debye and 2d debye substrate densities of states using gf method .",
    "we consider four nano - particle modes , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the effect is analyzed pairwise , namely , we consider @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 as the nano - particle modes keeping other parameters unchanged .",
    "that is , we keep @xmath141 constant while changing the second mode and investigate dependence of decay of @xmath141-mode on the separation from the second nano - particle mode . for both 1d - debye ( figure [ fig:2modes ] ( a ) ( b ) and ( c ) ) and 2d - debye ( figure [ fig:2modes ] ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) ) cases",
    "we observe that the decay of excited modes gain a retardation as the mode frequencies get closer .",
    "a second behavior is the enhancement of fluctuations during decay as the mode frequencies get closer .",
    "both behaviors can be understood in terms of the spectral functions . in figure ( [ fig : narrow].a ) spectral functions of @xmath142 and @xmath143modes are plotted for single - mode ( dashed curves ) and multi - mode ( solid curves ) gf calculations .",
    "it is seen that the overlap is negligible and the spectra are not changed considerably . when the modes are closer ( figure [ fig : narrow].b ) the single - mode spectra ( dashed curves ) have finite overlap , correspondingly the multi - mode spectral functions effect each other .",
    "the lorentzian shape is distorted and the peak of @xmath144mode is enhanced . these result in retardation and fluctuations during decay .",
    "more precisely , the finite overlap of spectra lets the nano - particle to gain phonons back which are previously discharged to the substrate .",
    "this phonon exchange process continues during the dissipation and gives rise to retardations and fluctuations observed in figure ( [ fig:2modes ] ) .      in order to provide another basis on which the results obtained from the quantum treatment of the problem can be discussed",
    ", we refer to a classical treatment of the problem .",
    "we use a simple but effective approach , where we consider the nano - particle / substrate as a cluster / lattice of masses and harmonic springs in the first nearest neighbor approximation , and with the lattice having different dimensionalities . the interaction is described by a harmonic spring between an atom of the nano - particle and a substrate atom . using the dynamical matrix , the eigenmodes of the isolated nano - particle are determined and initial energy is loaded to desired modes by giving the initial velocities to the atoms in correspondence with the modes . in the presence of the interaction between the nano - particle and the substrate , the differential equations and hence the motion of all atoms are determined in discrete time steps which are on the order of a femtosecond .",
    "since the above stated classical version of the problem is not an exact analog to the quantum one , and due to quantum vs. classical natures of the two , we compare and contrast the basic features of the results emerging from them . to be specific",
    ", we expect to verify qualitative issues like dependence on interaction strength , nano - particle mode frequency and the effect of neighboring modes .    in agreement with the earlier prediction based on the elastic continuum model @xcite , and the result previously obtained using the spectral function",
    ", the dependence of decay rate on the interaction strength obeys @xmath128 law for weak coupling . likewise , the dependence on internal degrees of freedom of the nano - particle verifies the previously obtained result .        keeping the coupling strength constant , higher frequency modes decay slower(figure [ fig : md_kmol_1d ] ) .",
    "we should note that the substrate dos in the neighborhood of the nano - particle mode frequency also affects the decay rates . using a 1d substrate and choosing the nano - particle modes away from the maximum frequency of the substrate ,",
    "the effect of substrate dos is minimized .",
    "although the density of substrate phonon modes is higher for higher frequencies , the decay rate decreases due to nano - particle mode frequency dependence .",
    "another property of the dissipation process becomes apparent when the dynamics is analyzed when the nano - particle has one and two vibrational modes .",
    "we consider a diatomic molecule and a linear triatomic molecule , which have one and two vibrational modes along the molecular axis , where the interaction is also along the molecular axis .",
    "the effect of neighboring mode can be be analyzed by setting one of the modes of the triatomic molecule at the same frequency with the frequency of the diatomic one .",
    "exciting only the common frequency of both diatomic and triatomic molecules , we compare the decay rates keeping the interaction and substrate parameters fixed . in the weak coupling regime",
    ", it is observed that the decay rate of the common mode does not change appreciably .",
    "moreover , exciting both vibrational modes of the triatomic molecule does not effect the decay rate of the common mode to a great extend .",
    "this property becomes more apparent as the coupling strength is weakened .",
    "since the vibrational modes of a triatomic molecule along the molecular axis are well - separated this result is expected in the light of gf solution of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "the mode localization effect is also tested using classical md simulations .",
    "a molecular mode whose frequency lies above the maximum frequency of the substrate has a small but yet finite decay rate .",
    "a theoretical understanding of the phononic dissipation from a nano - structure weakly coupled to a substrate has been developed using three different methods .",
    "the eom technique is able to yield analytical results , but has a limited range of applicability because of the fact that inverse laplace transformation is not always possible . on the other hand ,",
    "fa diagonalization is possible for any type of substrate density of states and any type of coupling , but is restricted to single nano - particle mode considerations only . using gfs , the effect of neighboring nano - particle modes can also be investigated .",
    "it is shown that stronger the coupling , faster is the rate of dissipation . since the width of the spectrum of a single nano - particle mode scales with the value of the substrate dos at the shifted frequency of the nano - particle mode , we observe that a single nano - particle mode coupled to a 2d - debye substrate decays faster than the one coupled to a 1d - debye substrate . this situation can be reversed for those frequencies for which 1d - dos is higher than the 2d - dos , namely for low frequencies ( larger nano - particles ) .",
    "that is , at frequencies at which 1d - dos has higher values than 2d - dos , decay rate of a mode coupled to the 1d substrate will be higher than that of the mode coupled to 2d substrate provided that the remaining factors are kept identical .",
    "presence of neighboring nano - particle modes effect each other s decay rate when their spectral functions have an appreciable overlap .",
    "transitions between nano - particle modes take place via the substrate modes , therefore retardation as well as fluctuations become important when the modes are close enough .",
