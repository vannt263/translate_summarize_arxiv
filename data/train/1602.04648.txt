    "the prediction of the behavior of dynamical systems is of fundamental importance in all scientific disciplines . since ancient times",
    ", philosophers and scientists have tried to formulate observational models and infer future states of such systems .",
    "applications include topics as diverse as weather forecasting @xcite , the prediction of the motion of the planets @xcite , or the estimation of quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "the common ingredient of such systems - at least in natural sciences - is the existence of an underlying mathematical model which can be applied as the predictor . in recent years , the use of artificial intelligence ( ai ) or machine learning ( ml ) methods have complemented the formulation of such mathematical models through the application of advanced data analysis algorithms that allow accurate estimation of observed dynamics by learning automatically from the given observations and building models in terms of their own modelling languages .",
    "artificial neural networks ( anns ) are one example of such techniques that are popularly applied to model dynamic phenomena .",
    "anns are structured as networks of soft weights organized in layers or so - called neurons or hidden units .",
    "one problem of ann type approaches is the difficult - to - interpret black - box nature of the learnt models .",
    "symbolic regression - based approaches , such as genetic programming ( gp ) , provide alternative ml methods that are recently gaining increasing popularity .",
    "these methods , similar to other ml counterparts , learn models from observed data and act as good predictors of the future states of dynamical systems .",
    "their added advantages over other methods include the interpretable nature of their learnt models and a flexible and weakly - typed @xcite modelling language that allows them to be applied to a variety of domains and problems .    undoubtedly , the methods used most often in ml are neural networks .",
    "these involve deep learning , in the sense that several layers are used and interpreted as the organization of patterns , as one imagines the human brain to work . in the present study , involving deterministic systems ,",
    "we want to use a certain branch of ml , namely symbolic regression .",
    "this technique joins the classical , equation - oriented approach with its computer - scientific upstart . in this publication",
    "we do not present any major improvements in the algorithms ; rather we demonstrate how one can apply symbolic regression to identify and predict the future state of dynamical systems",
    ".    symbolic regression algorithms work by exploring a function space , which is generally bounded by a preselected set of mathematical operators and operands ( variables , constants , etc . ) , using a population of randomly generated candidate solutions .",
    "each candidate solution encoded as a tree essentially works as a function and is evaluated based on its fitness or in other words its ability to match the observed output .",
    "these candidate solutions are evolved using a fitness - weighted selection mechanism and different recombination and variation operators .",
    "one common problem in symbolic regression is the bloating effect which is caused by excessive lengthening of individual solutions or filling of the population by large number of solutions with low fitness . in this work",
    "we use a multi - objective function evaluation mechanism to avoid this problem by including minimizing the solution length as an explicit objective in the fitness function .",
    "symbolic regression subsumes linear regression , generalized linear regression , and generalized additive models into a larger class of methods .",
    "such methods have been used with success to infer equations of dynamical systems directly from data @xcite .",
    "one problem with deterministic chaotic systems is the sampling of phase space using embedding . for a high - dimensional system",
    ", this leads to prohibitively long sampling times .",
    "typical reconstruction methods use delay coordinates and the associated differences , this results in mapping models for the observed systems .",
    "mathematically , differential coordinates are better suited for modelingbut they are not always accessible from data . both approaches , difference and differential embedding , are discussed in @xcite with numerical methods to obtain suitable differential variables from data .",
    "modern methods like diffusion maps @xcite or local linear embedding @xcite , including the analysis of stochastic systems , circumvent the curse of dimensionality by working directly on the manifold of the dynamical system .",
    "apart from prediction and identification of dynamical systems @xcite , the symbolic regression approach has been used recently for the control of turbulent flow systems @xcite . in that application",
    ", we demonstrate how to find the symbolic equations in a very general form combined with subsequent automatic simplification and multiobjective optimization .",
    "this yields interpretable equations of a complexity that we can select .",
    "we use open - source python packages for the analysis .",
    "symbolic regression is conducted using an elastic net method provided by the fast function extraction package ( ffx ) for quick tests , and the more general , but usually slower method implemented as a genetic programming algorithm ( gp ) based on the deap package .",
    "subsequent simplification is obtained using sympy .",
    "of course , any other programming framework with similar functionality will do .    for a systematic study",
    "we examine numerically - generated data from a harmonic oscillator as the simplest system to be predicted , and a more involved system of coupled fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators , which are known to produce complex behaviour and may serve as a very simple model for neurons .",
    "we investigate the capacity of the ml approach to detect an incoming front of activity , and give exact equations for the regression .",
    "we compare different sampling and spatio - temporal embedding methods , and discuss the results : it is shown that a space - time embedding has advantages over time - only and space - only embedding .",
    "our final example concerns a real - world application , the short - term and medium - term forecasting of solar power production . in principle",
    ", this could be achieved trivially by a high - resolution weather forecast and knowledge of the transfer of solar energy to solar cells , a very well - understood process @xcite .",
    "however , such a highly resolved weather forecast does not exist , because it is prohibitively expensive : even the largest meteorological computers are still unable to compute the weather on small spatial scales , let alone with a long time horizon at high accuracy . as the dynamical systems community identified a long time ago , this is mainly due to uncertainties in the initial conditions , as demonstrated by the celebrated lorenz equations @xcite .",
    "consequently , we follow a data - based approach and improve upon weather predictions using local energy production data as a time series .",
    "we are aware that use of the full set of weather data will improve the reported forecast , but increasing the resolution is not our interest here , rather the proof of concept of the ml method and its applicability to real - world problems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] we discuss the methods and explain our approach .",
    "this section is followed by a longer section [ sec : results ] where results are presented for the above - mentioned example systems .",
    "we end the paper with a summary and conclusions , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the field of dynamical systems ( ds ) , and in particular nonlinear dynamical systems , reconstruction of the characteristics of an observed system from data has been and is a fundamental scientific topic .    in this regard , one can distinguish parameter and structure identification .",
    "we first discuss the existing literature on parameter identification which is easier in that there is an established mathematical framework to fit coefficients to known curves representing experimental data , which in turn result from known dynamics .",
    "this can be conducted for linear or non - linear functions . for deterministic systems , with the advent of modern computers , quantities like fractal dimensions , lyapunov exponents and entropies can also be computed to make systems comparable in dynamics @xcite .",
    "these analyses further allow the rough characterization of the type and number of orbits of a ds @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , embedding techniques have been developed to reconstruct the dynamics of a high - dimensional system from lower - dimensional time series @xcite .",
    "these techniques have a number of limitations with respect to accuracy and the amount of data needed for making good predictive models .",
    "a chaotic system with positive lyapunov exponents has a prediction horizon which depends heavily on accuracy and precision of the data , since chaos `` destroys '' information .",
    "this can be seen very clearly by the shift map example @xcite .",
    "however a system on a regular orbit , even marked with complicated equations , might be predicted accurately . for high - dimensional systems , one needs a large amount of data to address the `` curse of dimensionality '' @xcite .",
    "in fact it can be shown that for each dimension , the number of data needed increases on a power - law basis @xcite .",
    "eventually , the direct inference of the underlying equations of motion from data can be approached using regression methods , like kalman filtering , general linear models ( glm ) , generalized additive models ( gam ) , or more general schemes , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "apart from the equations themselves , partial derivatives often have to be estimated @xcite , which is an additional problem for low - precision data    we also consider structure identification , which as mentioned above is a more complicated task . in the last 10 - 15 years , powerful new methods from computer science have been applied to this purpose .",
    "this includes numerous studies on diffusion maps , local linear embedding , manifold learning , support vector machines , artificial neural networks , and symbolic regression @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on symbolic regression .",
    "it must be emphasized that most methods are not unique and their success can only be tested based on their predictive power .",
    "one drawback of many computational - oriented methods is the lack of equations that can be analyzed mathematically in the neighborhood of analyzed trajectories .",
    "symbolic regression is a way to produce such equations .",
    "it includes methods that identify the structure or parameters of the searched equation or both of them simultaneously with respect to objective functions @xmath0 .",
    "this means that methods like glm , or gam are contained in such a description .",
    "a recent implementation of glms is fast function extraction ( ffx ) @xcite , which is explained briefly below .",
    "genetic programming , explained in detail below , is another intuitive method and often used for symbolic regression . here , the algorithm searches the function space through random combinations and mutations of functions , chosen from a basic set of equations .",
    "symbolic regression is supposed to be form free and thus unbiased towards human perception .",
    "however , human knowledge enters in the meta - rules imposed on the model through the basic building blocks and rules on how they can be combined .",
    "thus , the optimal model is always conditioned on the underlying meta - rules .",
    "genetic programming is an evolutionary algorithm to find an optimal algorithm or program .",
    "the term `` programming '' in optimization is used synonymously with `` plan '' or algorithm .",
    "it was used first by dantzig , the inventor of linear programming , at a time when computer programs did not exist as we know them today @xcite .",
    "the algorithm seeks an optimal algorithm , in our case a function , using evolutionary , or `` genetic '' strategies , as explained below .",
    "the pioneering work was established by @xcite .",
    "we can briefly describe it as follows : in gp we can represent formulae as expression trees , such as that shown in fig .  [ fig : crossovermutation ] .",
    "non - terminal nodes are filled with elements from a basic function set defined by the meta - rules .",
    "terminal nodes consist of variables or parameters . given the optimization problem @xmath1 we seek the optimal solution @xmath2 through optimizing ( minimizing or maximizing , or for some cost functionals , finding the supremum or infimum ) the fitness ( or cost ) functional @xmath3 . to find the optimal solution ,",
    "gp uses a whole population of candidate solutions in parallel which are evolved iteratively through fitness proportionate selection , recombination and mutation operations .",
    "the initial generation is created randomly .",
    "afterwards , the algorithm cycles through the following loop until it reaches its convergence or stopping criteria :    * * breed * : based on the current generation @xmath4 , a new set of size @xmath5 of alternative candidate solutions , the offspring @xmath6 , are selected . several problem - dependent operators are used for this tweaking step , e.g. changing parts of a candidate solution ( mutation ) or combining two solutions into two new ones ( crossover ) .",
    "these tweaking operations may include selection pressure , so that the `` fitter '' solutions are more likely to produce offspring . * * evaluate * : the offspring @xmath6 are evaluated , i.e. their fitness is calculated . * * select * : based on the fitness value , members of the next generation are selected .",
    "this scheme fits the requirements of symbolic regression .",
    "mutation is typically conducted by replacing a random subtree by a new tree .",
    "crossover takes two trees and swaps random subtrees between them .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossovermutation ] .",
    "the fitness function uses a typical error metric , e.g. least squares or normalized root mean squared error .",
    "the random mutations sample the vicinity of their parent solution in function space . as a random mutation",
    "could likely lead to less optimal solution , it does not ensure a bias towards optimality .",
    "however , this is achieved by the selection , because it ensures that favourable mutations are kept in the set while others are not considered in further iterations .    by design and when based on similar meta - rules , gp includes other algorithms like glms or linear programming @xcite .    .",
    "mutation is conducted by picking a random subtree , here the single terminal node @xmath7 and replacing it with a new random expression tree .",
    "similarly , the crossover operator ( right ) takes two expression trees and swaps two random subtrees . ]",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14      here we briefly summarize the ffx algorithm of mcconaghy et al .",
    "this is a symbolic regression algorithm based on a combined generalized linear model and elastic net approach : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are a set of coefficients to be determined , and @xmath17 are an overdetermined set of basis functions described by an heuristic , simplicity - driven set of rules ( e.g. highest allowed polynomial exponent , products , non - linear functions , @xmath18 ) .    in the elastic method ,",
    "a least squares criterion is used to solve the fitting problem . to avoid overfitting , i.e. high model sensitivity on training data ,",
    "two regulating terms are added : the @xmath19 , and @xmath20 norms of the coefficient vector .",
    "the @xmath19 norm favors a sparse model ( few coefficients ) and simultaneously avoids large coefficients .",
    "the @xmath20 norm ensures a more stable convergence as it allows for several , possibly correlated variables instead of a single one .",
    "the resulting objective function written in its explicit form reads @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the data , @xmath23 the regularization weight and @xmath24 $ ] is the mixing between @xmath19 and @xmath20 norms .",
    "a benefit of the regularized objective function is that it implicitly gives rise to models with different complexity , i.e. different number of bases @xmath25 .    for large values of @xmath5",
    ", the predicted coefficients will all be zero .",
    "reducing @xmath5 will result in more complicated combinations of non - zero coefficients .",
    "for every point on the @xmath26-grid , the `` elastic net '' , one can obtain a single optimal model using a standard solver like coordinate descent to determine the optimal coefficients @xmath27 .",
    "a small change in the elastic net parameters leads to a small change in @xmath27 such that one can use the already obtained solution of a neighboring grid point to restart coordinate descent with the new parameters .",
    "for the obtained models we can calculate the normalized root mean - squared error and model complexity ( number of used basis functions ) .",
    "the ffx algorithm is based purely on deterministic calculations .",
    "hence its runtime compared to a similar gp algorithm is significantly shorter",
    ". however , the meta - rules are more stringent .      as mentioned above , the solution of the regression problem is not unique in general .",
    "a major factor which motivates symbolic regression is its comprehensible white - box nature opposed to the black - box nature of , for example neural networks . invoking ockhams razor ( lex parsimoniae ) ,",
    "a simple solution is considered superior to a complicated one @xcite as it is more easy to comprehend .",
    "in addition , more complicated functions are prone to overfitting .",
    "this means that complexity should be a criterion in the function search , such that more complex functions are considered less optimal .",
    "we therefore seek a solution which satisfies two objectives .",
    "comparing solutions by more than one metric @xmath0 is not straightforward .",
    "one possible approach is to weight these metrics into one objective @xmath3 :    @xmath28    making different candidate solutions easily comparable . the elastic net eq .",
    "[ eq : elasticnet ] uses such a composite metric .",
    "however , _ a priori _ it is assumed that there is a linear trade - off between the individual objectives .",
    "this has three major flaws :    * one needs to determine suitable ( problem dependent ) @xmath29 . *",
    "one does not account for non - linear trade - offs ( e.g. all - or - nothing in one objective ) .",
    "* instead of single optimal solution there may be a set of optimal solutions defining the compromise between conflicting objectives ( here error vs complexity ) .",
    "the optimal set is also called the pareto - front .",
    "this is the set of non - dominated candidate solutions , i.e. candidate solutions that are not worse than any other solution in the population when compared on all objectives . for the ffx algorithm ,",
    "explained above , one can obtain the ( pareto- ) optimal set of candidate solutions by sorting the models .",
    "the mapping from parameter space to the pareto - optimal set is called pareto - filtering .    interestingly",
    ", the concept of non - domination already partly solves the sorting problem in higher dimensions as it maps from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ordered one - dimensional manifolds : candidate solutions in the pareto - front are of rank 0 .",
    "similarly , one can find models of rank 1 , i.e. all models that are dominated only once ( or in other words the nondominated models of all models taken out of the original pareto - front ) .",
    "model 1 @xmath32 can be said to be better than model 2 @xmath33 if its rank is lower : @xmath34 to compare models of the same rank , one has to introduce an additional heuristic criterion , for which there are several choices @xcite .",
    "usually the criterion promotes uniqueness of a candidate solution to ensure diversity of the population to avoid becoming trapped in a local minimum . as the uniqueness of a solution may depend on its representation and",
    "is usually costly to compute , often its projection to fitness space is used .",
    "this is conducted to ensure an effective spread of candidate solutions on the pareto - front .",
    "for example , the non - dominated sorting algorithm ii ( nsgaii ) @xcite uses a heuristic metric called crowding distance or sparsity to compare two models of the same rank . the scaled euclidean distance in fitness space to the neighboring models",
    "is used to describe the uniqueness of a model .",
    "for nsgaii we have : @xmath35 out of the current generation and their offspring @xmath36 the @xmath37 best , in terms of @xmath38 , solutions are chosen for the next generation @xmath39 .",
    "this selection method ensures elitism , i.e. the best solutions found so far are carried forward in next generations .",
    "looking at the high - level description in algorithm  [ alg : mumu ] , @xmath4 can be seen as an archive which keeps old members as long as they are not dominated by a new solution from the current offspring @xmath6 .",
    "the different selection strategies were first studied in the context of genetic algorithms , but more recently they have been successfully applied to symbolic regression @xcite .",
    "for all applications below , our function set is @xmath40 .",
    "all discontinuities are defined as zero .",
    "our terminal set consists of the input data @xmath41 as well as symbolic constants @xmath42 which are determined during evaluation .",
    "we set up our multiple objectives as follows : the algorithm runs until the error of the most accurate model is below 0.1% , or for 100 generations .",
    "the population size @xmath37 as well as the number of offspring per generation @xmath5 is set to 500 .",
    "the depth of individuals of the initial populations varies randomly between 1 and 4 . with equal probability",
    "we generate the corresponding expression trees where each leaf might have a different depth or each leaf is forced to have the same depth . for mutation we randomly pick a subtree and replace it with a new tree , again using the half and half method , with minimum size 0 and maximum size 2 .",
    "crossover is conducted by randomly picking a subtree each and exchanging them .",
    "our breeding step is composed of randomly choosing two individuals from the current population , performing crossover on them with probability @xmath43 and afterwards always mutating them .",
    "our multiobjective cost functional has the following components @xmath44 where nrmse is the normalized root mean - squared error of the observed data @xmath22 and its predictor @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is simply the total number of nodes in the expression tree @xmath47 .",
    "selection is conducted according to nsgaii . in this paper , a model",
    "is called accurate if its error metric @xmath48 is small , where `` small '' depends on the context .",
    "for example , numerical data might be modeled accurately if @xmath49 and measured data might be modeled accurately if @xmath50 .",
    "similarly a model is complicated if its complexity @xmath51 is relatively large . `` good '' and its comparatives are to be understood in the sense of @xmath38 .    during the generation of the initial population and selection , we force diversity by prohibiting identical solutions .",
    "it is very unlikely to randomly create identical solutions .",
    "however , offspring may be nearly identical in structure as well as fitness and consequently a crossover between parent and child solution may produce an identical grandchild solution .",
    "the probability of such an event grows exponentially with the number of identical solutions in a population and therefore it reduces the diversity of the population in the long - term risking a pre - mature convergence of the algorithm .",
    "thus , by prohibiting identical solutions , the population will have a transient period until it reaches its maximum capacity .",
    "this will also reduce the effective number of offspring per generation .",
    "this change reduces the probability of becoming trapped in a local minimum because of a steady state in the evolutionary loop .",
    "our main emphasis is the treatment of the model parameters @xmath42 . in standard implementations ,",
    "e.g. the already mentioned @xcite , the parameters are mutated randomly , like all other nodes . here , using modern computational power we are able to use traditional parameter optimization algorithms .",
    "thus , the calculation of @xmath48 becomes another optimization task given the current model @xmath52 :    @xmath53    with    @xmath54    the initial guess for @xmath42 is either inherited or set to one .",
    "thus , we effectively have two combined optimization layers .",
    "each run is conducted using 10 restarts of the algorithm .",
    "the pareto front is the joined front of the individual runs .",
    "finally , we can use algebraic frameworks to simplify the obtained formulae .",
    "this is useful , since a formula ( phenotype , macrostate ) may be represented by many different expression trees ( genotypes , microstates ) .",
    "we present here results for three systems with increasing difficulty : first , we demonstrate the principles using a very simple system , the harmonic oscillator ; second , we infer a predictive model for a set of coupled oscillators ; and finally we show how we can predict a very applied system , namely the power production from a solar panel . for the first two examples we use numerically produced data , where we have full control over the system , while for the demonstration of applicability we use data from a small solar power station @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the first test of our methodology : an oscillator should be identified correctly and a accurate prediction must be possible .",
    "consequently , we investigate the identification of a prediction model , not necessarily using a differential formalism . this might be interpreted as finding an approximation to the solution of the underlying equation by data analysis .",
    "a deep investigation of the validity of the solution for certain classes of systems is rather mathematical and is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "our system reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath22 are the state variables and @xmath57 is a constant .",
    "we use the particular analytical solution @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the prediction target is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a time increment .",
    "since the analytical solution is a linear combination of the feature inputs , just @xmath62 data points are needed to train the model .",
    "this holds for infinite accuracy of the data and serves as a trivial test for the method . in general , a learning algorithm is `` trained '' on some data and the validity of the result is tested on another set , that is as independent as possible . that way ,",
    "overfitting is avoided .",
    "for the same reason one needs to define a stop criterion for the algorithm , e.g. the data accuracy is @xmath63 , it is useless and even counterproductive to run an algorithm until a root mean square error of @xmath64 ( the cost function used here ) is achieved .",
    "for the example under consideration , we stop the training once the training error is smaller than 1    typically , a realistic scenario should include the effect of noise , e.g. in the form of measurement uncertainties .",
    "we consequently add `` measurement '' gaussian noise with mean zero and variance proportional to the signal amplitude : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , hence @xmath67 .",
    "the training and testing data sets were created as follows : the data are generated between @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "out of the first half , we chose @xmath69 values at random for training .",
    "for testing purposes we use the second half .",
    "we study the parameter space @xmath70 and average the testing errors over 10 realizations for each parameter set . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsevssigma ] we display the normalized root mean squared error of the prediction using ffx ( measured against the noisy data ) as a function of the noise amplitude .",
    "given @xmath71 and @xmath72 the analytical solution for the non - noisy system is just a linear combination , i.e. @xmath73 , and has a complexity of two . during training",
    "we aim for a nrmse of 1% .",
    "thus , we find the analytical solution in the limit of small noise amplitude @xmath74 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : rmsevssigma ] and fig  [ fig : compvssigma ] .",
    "strong noise covers the signal and thus the error saturates .     for different training set lengths @xmath69 and fixed @xmath75 .",
    "sufficiently small noise does not worsen the predictability , i.e. the prediction algorithm stops at the target training nrmse of 1% .",
    "after 0.3 the error does not increase further , since the noise covers the signal completely . ]",
    "[ fig : rmsevssigma ]    the length of the analyzed data is another important parameter : typically one expects convergence of the error @xmath76 for more data .",
    "a `` vertical '' cut through the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsevssigma ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsevslength ] . the training set length @xmath69 has a much lower impact than the classical scaling suggests .",
    "crucial for this scaling is the form free structure as well as the heuristic which is used to select the final model . for demonstration purposes",
    ", we chose the most accurate model on the testing set , which is of course vulnerable to overfitting .",
    "the average complexity , calculated by eq .   of the final model as a function of the noise amplitude ,",
    "is shown in fig  [ fig : compvssigma ] . as evident",
    "we can recover the three regimes of fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsevssigma ] . for small noise ,",
    "the analytical and numerical solution agree . in the intermediate regime",
    "we find on average more complex models ( in comparison to the analytical solution ) .",
    "very strong noise hides the signal and a good prediction is impossible .",
    "the optimal solution tends to be single constant , i.e. for high @xmath74 the complexity tends to smaller values as seen in fig  [ fig : compvssigma ] .",
    "the prediction error has two components : 1 ) given a structure , noisy data will lead to uncertain parameters and 2 ) due to the form - free nature of symbolic regression , noisy data will also lead to an uncertain structure , increasing the uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "thus , final model selection has to be performed carefully , especially when dealing with noisy data .",
    "a detailed study is presented for the example of coupled oscillators .",

    "[ fig : compvssigma ]      the harmonic oscillator is an easy case to treat with our methods .",
    "now , we extend the analysis to add a spatial dimension . we study a model of fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators @xcite on a ring .",
    "the oscillators are coupled and generate traveling pulse solutions .",
    "the model was originally derived as a simplification of the hodgkin - huxley model to describe spikes in axons @xcite , and serves nowadays as a paradigm for excitable dynamics . here",
    ", its spiky behavior is used as an abstraction of a front , observed in real world applications like the human brain , modeled by connected neurons , or a wind power plant network where fronts of different pressure pass through the locations of the wind power plants .",
    "the aim is to show that temporal and/or spatial information on the state of some network sites enables an increase in predictability of a chosen site or eventually ( if there are waves in the network ) to the front detection .",

    "the data were sampled at times @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "the system has multiple time scales : two are associated with the on - site fitzhugh - nagumo oscillator ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) , while two more are due to diffusive coupling ( @xmath107 ) and perturbation ( @xmath108 behaves as @xmath109 described above ) .",

    "the speed of the spike or front is consequently @xmath114 .",
    "an animation of this can be found in the supplemental material .",
    "the training data , denoted as well feature set , were recorded in three different ways :    * * site - only * : only @xmath93 is recorded , and time - delayed features @xmath115 are also included with @xmath116 . *",

    "for each site we also include the time delayed features .    to avoid introducing additional symbols we use state variables with double subscripts for discrete times , where the second index refers to time , and one subscript for continuous time .",
    "the respective useage is evident from the context .",
    "we choose to predict the state at time @xmath119 given the data described above .",
    "in other words , the prediction target is @xmath120 with @xmath121 , corresponding to the requirement to be far engouh from the excitation point .",
    "of course , this implies a distance of @xmath122 .",
    "the testing and training sets were selected by using every second point of the recorded time series .",

    "all curves have one point in common which represents the best fitting constant ( complexity 0 ) .",
    "as one would expect , the site only data do not contain enough information to detect a front .",
    "thus , even high complexity models can not reach an error below 4% and the required error of 1% is never met . in the two other datasets",

    ", the most accurate model of the mixed data set is still the most accurate model overall .    in the following",
    "we discuss the results for the best models for each feature set .    .",
    "this leads to the non - convex shape of the front based on the most information .",
    "the models are re - evaluated on the testing set . ]",
    "[ fig : ffxpareto ]    if we take the perspective of an observer sitting at @xmath125 , we see the spike passing : first the state is zero , then a slow increase is observed followed by a rapid increase and decrease around the spike maximum .",
    "eventually the state returns slowly to zero .",
    "statistically , the algorithm is trained by long quiet times and a short , complicated spike form which is hard to model by a reduced set of state variables .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffx_diffa ] where for any feature set the biggest differences occur in the spike region .",
    "apparently , the model with site - only variables shows worse results than the spatial one , and the spatio - temporal set models best the passing spike .",

    "this reflects the approximation of the incoming front by a quadratic term .",
    "if , however only spatial points are used , the dynamics far away are used to predict the incoming front . if the small terms are neglected , the model consists of the signal at the target site itself , and the previous site ( -2 ) which carries the largest weight .",
    "physically , it means that despite being far away the front is already felt at 2 sites away . since the front is stationary in a co - moving frame ,",
    "spatio - temporal embedding is best , namely sampling the spike train in space and moving in time with the train velocity .",
    "then we have a simple and compact linear dependence as seen in the last row of table  [ table : ffxeq ] .",

    "the state at @xmath133 is at the backside of the front and together the most important information , namely the increase and decrease of the incoming signal is selected by the model .",
    "alternatively , since @xmath134 the best model in table  [ table : ffxeq ] can be interpreted as the weighted average of the closest combination @xmath135 to represent the front velocity ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "this demonstrates how powerful the algorithm works in selecting important features .",

    "[ fig : gppareto ] . for each feature",
    "set we obtain a non - convex pareto front .",
    "the shape and the values of the fronts are broadly similar to the results obtained by ffx .",
    "because gp is an evolutionary method and relies on random breeding rules , we display averaged results : we initialize the algorithm with different seeds of the random number generator , calculate the pareto fronts and average the errors for the non dominated models of the same complexity .",
    "note that not all complexities occur on each particular front .",
    "this way , we obtain a generic pareto front and avoid atypical models which may occur by chance . the specific model given below in the tables",
    "is not averaged , but the best result for one specific seed ( 42 ) .",

    "[ fig : gppareto ]    the difference plots for the method are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : gp_diff ] .",
    "while the site only set is not able to give a convincing model for an incoming front , the spatially extended set gives a reasonable model with little error .",
    "the mixed model is very good with perfect coincidence of model and true dynamics .",
    "this model can not be distinguished by eye from the observed signal .",
    "+    [ fig : gp_diff ]    the models provided by the gp algorithm with seed 42 are given in table  [ table : res_gp ] .",
    "due to the very general character of gp these can be overwhelming at first glance .",

    "@xmath137 + spatially extended & @xmath138 + temporal spatial & @xmath139 +    the interpretation of the gp results requires a bit more thinking .",
    "in essence , they follow a logic similar to the ffx results .",
    "the site - only model is complicated , and instead of a square operator a trigonometric function is used to mimic the incoming pulse . since the data do not include directly all information needed , the algorithm tries to fit unphysical functions .",
    "this is clearly a non - deterministic and overfitting result , mirrored by the high complexity of the functions involved . for spatially extended models ,",
    "we obtain a linear and sinusoidal components , and the model uses only three features , namely the on - site values and the ones at two and four units left on our site under consideration . remarkably , a sinusoidal behavior detected with an exponential decrease , which is our intuition . eventually , the spatio - temporal embedding yields a very simple model which approximates the front velocity @xmath140 to be between @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the accuracy of this model is very high .",
    "summarizing , when given enough input information , both methods find a linear model for the predictor @xmath143 by finding the most suitable combination of temporal and spatial shift to mimic the constant front velocity .",
    "if this information is not available in the input data , nonlinear functions are used .      in this section ,",
    "we describe the results obtained for one - day - ahead forecasting of solar power production .",
    "the input data used for training are taken from the unisolar solar panel installation at potsdam university with about 30 kw installed .",
    "details are found at @xcite .",
    "we join the solar power data with meteorological forecast data from the freely available european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) portal @xcite as well as the actual observed weather data .",
    "these public data are of limited quality and serve for our proof of concept with real data and all their deficiencies .",
    "the solar panel data @xmath144 were recorded every five minutes , at geoposition 52.41 latitude , 12.98 longitude .",
    "the information about the weather can be split into two categories : weather observations of a station near the power source @xmath145 and the weather forecast @xmath146 , where @xmath61 is the time difference to the prediction target .",
    "we do not have weather data from the station directly , but can use data from a weather station nearby ( i d : 10379 ) .",
    "the weather forecast data are obtained every six hours at the closest location publicly accessible , 52.5 latitude and 13 longitude .",
    "typical meteorological data contain , but are not limited to , the wind speed and direction , pressure at different levels , the irradiation , cloud coverage , temperature and humidity .",
    "however , in this example , we only use temperature and cloudiness as well as their forecasts as features for our model . the latter is obtained by minimizing @xmath147 with @xmath47 the model under consideration .",
    "our prediction target is @xmath148 with @xmath149 , the one - day - ahead power production .",
    "we create our datasets with a sampling of 1h .",
    "while additional information from the solar power data remains unused , the prediction variables have to be interpolated .",
    "the quality of the forecast depends on quality of the weather measurement and weather forecast .",

    "testing is conducted for august 2014 . to obtain first impression ( assuming no prior knowledge ) , we calculate the mutual correlation of the data .",
    "the power produced the next day is heavily correlated with the predicted solar irradiation .",
    "this is a confirmation that the physics involved is mirrored in the model and that weather prediction is good in average .",

    "as above , for the coupled oscillators , we have conducted 10 runs with different seeds and display the averaged result .",
    "of course , for the training set ( filled diamonds ) , increasing complexity means decreasing error .",
    "we see a strong deviation for very complicated models of the testing data ( filled circles ) .",

    "as said in the introduction , a perfect weather prediction with high resolution would render this work useless for power production forecast ( although not for other questions ) .",

    "more precisely , we identify a system of equations yielding optimal forecasts in terms of a minimized normalized root mean squared error of the difference between model forecast and observation of the system state .",

    ". these will be subject of future investigations .",
    "such work is to be carried out carefully to find the limitations of the approach , in particular of genetic programming , which is rather uncontrolled in the way the search space is explored . on the other hand",
