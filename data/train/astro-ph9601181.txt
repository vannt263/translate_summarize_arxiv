    "early examples of gravitational lensing ( @xcite ) consisted of several compact images of quasars .",
    "when the background source is extended ( @xcite ) , the images can join in a ring of emission around the lensing galaxy , and multiply - imaged source features can provide many constraints on the lensing mass distribution . for mg1549 + 3047 , the background source is an extended radio lobe ( @xcite ) , whose unusual structure is easily explained by a simple lensing model . here",
    "we will be mostly concerned with the lensing galaxy , g1 ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) , which lies directly in front of the northwest radio lobe .",
    "assuming an isothermal mass profile for g1 , lehr(1993 ) predicted its central velocity dispersion to be @xmath3 .",
    "a measured optical velocity dispersion @xmath4 should be comparable to this value .",
    "of course , neither the mass nor the stellar profiles need be isothermal . for a hubble profile stellar population in an isothermal gravitational potential , @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this factor strongly affects the interpretation of lensing statistics ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , considering a wider range of dynamical models , and taking observational limitations into account , kochanek ( 1993 ) expects that @xmath2 in most cases .",
    "systems like mg1549 + 3047 provide a rare opportunity to test this prediction , since gravitational lensing can probe the total mass distribution .",
    "we obtained long slit spectra of g1 on the night of 1992.04.28 at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope , using the red arm of the isis spectrograph .",
    "an eev ccd detector was illuminated via the r600r grating , centered on @xmath6 , with a @xmath7 dichroic .",
    "this arrangement gave @xmath8 per pixel , or @xmath9 , and a spectral coverage of @xmath10 .",
    "the slit width was @xmath11 on the sky ( @xmath12 pixels or @xmath13 ) , and was aligned with the major axis of g1 ( pa = @xmath14 ) .",
    "the field of view along the slit was @xmath15 .",
    "six 30-minute exposures were taken . using the same instrument configuration on 1992.05.01 , we observed one radial velocity standard star of spectral type k2 ( k2.1=hd155642 ) , and two of type k5 ( k5.1=hd155581 , k5.2=hd156649 ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures , and re - sampled into @xmath16 bins .",
    "figure  1 shows the sum of all six g1 spectra ( g1.sum ) , along with a standard star spectrum .",
    "we measured the velocity dispersion in g1 using a standard cross - correlation method ( @xcite ; iraf task `` fxcor '' ) .",
    "the three radial velocity standard star spectra were used as templates .",
    "we removed 5th order spline fit baselines from the spectra and apodized by a 10% cosine bell , before fourier transforming and applying a high - pass filter of @xmath17 in wavenumber .",
    "finally , we fitted a gaussian to the maximum correlation peak to determine its width and offset .",
    "we calibrated the correlation peak width using synthetic galaxy spectra ( the template star spectra convolved with known gaussian dispersions , see figure  2 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the k2.1 template gave higher cross - correlations than the k5 stars , so it is probably a better model of the g1 absorption features .",
    "we estimated the `` random '' contribution to the measurement uncertainty by performing separate cross - correlations for each of the six g1 exposures , and taking the rms of the dispersions .",
    "the `` systematic '' uncertainty , due to template mismatch , was estimated from the range of dispersions obtained when different stellar templates were used . combining these estimates in quadrature , we found @xmath18 .",
    "our cross - correlation analysis also yields a radial velocity of @xmath19 for g1 .",
    "this result confirms a previously reported redshift of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .    since g1 is extended , we extracted spectra for seven @xmath21 apertures parallel to the galaxy trace in the co - added data .",
    "the cross - correlation results are given in table  1 , and figure  3 shows the velocity profiles .",
    "the radial velocity shows a strong linear trend , which indicates that g1 is rotating .",
    "our velocity dispersion , @xmath18 , is very close to the @xmath22 derived for an isothermal lens model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two mass estimates remain comparable for any source redshift @xmath0 , confirming the basic lensing prediction .",
    "the radio properties and optical color of the source suggest that @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , mg1549 + 3047 is a steep spectrum source drawn from a flux - limited radio source list ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming a spectral index of @xmath24 , the selection cutoff corresponds to the flux limit of the parkes 2.7ghz radio survey ( @xcite ) , for which @xmath25 has been measured .",
    "thus @xmath1 is most likely .",
    "the systematic shift in radial velocity implies that g1 is rotating .",
    "the velocity is still increasing in the outermost apertures , so the maximum @xmath26 must exceed @xmath27 .",
    "g1 can be compared to an oblate isotropic rotator using the @xmath28 factor ( @xcite ) , which exceeds 2 . from its color and radial profile",
    ", g1 appears to be an early - type galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "most ellipticals rotate more slowly , and this level of rotation is more characteristic of s0 galaxies or the bulges in disk galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical velocity dispersion can be compared with the total mass dispersion from lens models . assuming a source redshift of @xmath29 , the lens model gives an isothermal velocity dispersion @xmath30 ( @xcite ) , which is the same as @xmath4 .",
    "if the stellar tracers are assumed to have a hubble profile , the expected optical dispersion will be @xmath31 ( @xcite ) ; and the strong rotation in g1 does not affect this .",
    "our @xmath4 differs from this prediction by almost two standard deviations , and agrees with the expectation of kochanek ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , @xmath22 increases by @xmath32 if the source redshift @xmath33 .",
    "so although our observation favors @xmath2 , we can not clearly distinguish between the two dynamical models .",
    "we can also probe the dark matter distribution by comparing the lens models with the optical surface brightness profile .",
    "using the iraf task `` ellipse '' , we extracted profiles from each of the ccd images reported in lehr(1993 ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the average profile for the @xmath34  filter exposures . for sky surface brightnesses",
    "@xmath35 , we used a model of the form : @xmath36^{-p/2}~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 corresponds to an isothermal distribution , and @xmath38 yields a hubble profile .",
    "we found best fit models for each of the observed profiles , varying @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the best fit shape parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , did not vary with color . here ,",
    "the uncertainties are the rms of the parameter values , obtained from separate fits to each profile . for the mass distribution",
    ", we used a surface density model of the same form , with a quadrupole perturbation to account for the ellipticity @xmath44 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same image constraints and search method were applied as in lehr(1993 ) .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath40 , @xmath45 and @xmath41 ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "the @xmath46 values are very small , probably because the position uncertainties in lehr(1993 ) are overestimated .",
    "to estimate the parameter uncertainties , we performed monte carlo simulations , where the image positions were perturbed within their assumed @xmath47 uncertainties .",
    "when @xmath41 is close to its optical value , the best fit @xmath40 is also consistent with the optical profile , provided that @xmath48 .",
    "so although we can not uniquely determine @xmath41 , the lens constraints are consistent with the mass and light distributions being the same .",
    "we are now very close to a fully self - consistent lensing model for this system , and mg1549 + 3047 is promising for mass distribution studies .",
    "the background radio lobe has many structures , and it straddles the multiple - imaging boundary ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are best exploited by the `` lensclean '' method ( @xcite ) , which uses all of the source structure to constrain a lens model .",
    "the distance to the source is still unknown , however , and this deficiency affects many model predictions . obtaining the source redshift remains an important objective .",
