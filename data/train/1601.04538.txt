    "it is well known that our universe is now experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "several cosmological observational data defend this phenomenon as supernovae type ia , cosmic microwave background radiation , large scale structure , baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing @xcite . relying astronomical observational data , the universe",
    "is composed about 73% of dark energy and 27% of dark matter plus baryonic matter@xcite .",
    "dark energy and dark matter are thought to be respectively responsible for the current acceleration of the universe and of the dynamics of spiral galaxies .",
    "their presence in the universe is one of the puzzles of theoretical physics .",
    "thus , in this framework , there are a number of approaches dedicated to realize the effects of these mysterious components of the universe . among these approaches ,",
    "there may be mentioned the qcd dark energy what has been proposed to interpret the dark energy without any new parameter nor new degree of freedom . in this model ,",
    "the squared sound speed of the dark energy is negative , indicating an instability of the model against perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however the most famous approaches wanting demystified the effects of the black components of our universe , are those that to `` reconsider '' the cosmological constant @xmath8 in einstein s equations of general relativity ( gr ) . the energy associated with the cosmological constant represents the energy of the quantum vacuum@xcite and it is associated to negative pressure which is the parameter of equation of state @xmath9 .",
    "another popular approach is to modify the rg by replacing its geometric lagrangian density @xmath10 by algebraic function @xmath11 where @xmath10 is the variable .",
    "this approach leads to the @xmath11 gravity(see @xcite ) .",
    "gravity is one of the four natural fundamental interactions .",
    "it is inscribed in space - time by either rg or by teleparallel theory ( terg ) .",
    "general relativity can be defined as a geometric theory of gravitation , constructed from the levi - civita connection while the terg can be defined as a gauge theory of gravity , from the connection weizenbock @xcite . despite this basic difference",
    ", these two theories can be found to be equivalent  cite a.sousa , shirafuji , where the designation of teleparallel theory by teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( terg ) .",
    "thus the tegr is also seen modified by including an algebraic function @xmath12 of the torsion scalar @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the geometric lagrangian density of the terg .",
    "this gives rise to the famous @xmath0 gravity@xcite .",
    "interesting results are obtained with @xmath11 gravity@xcite , however , mathematical difficulties are more acute in this theory because its equations are four order .",
    "unlikely , the @xmath0 gravity has the advantage of producing two - order equations and it presents encouraging results ( for some recent reviw see@xcite ) .",
    "dark energy has spilled much ink in the literature , seen as cosmological constant @xcite or look in terms of fluid pressure which is related to energy density in particular form . in this vision , many models are reconstructed in the literature and they can be seen as unifying dark energy and dark matter . in this paper , we consider two of these special fluids : van der waals fluid and chaplygin gas .    the van der waals equation of state was introduced to overcome the inconsistency which may arise in a thermodynamics analysis of a system in which two phases exist simultaneously .",
    "this coexistence of phases occurred including the equivalence between the radiation dominated phase and the dust dominated phase .",
    "approaches were used by s. capozziello et al.@xcite to constrain the van der waals fluid to observational data . in these studies , it was shown that the van der waals fluid can be seen as unifying dark energy and dark matter .",
    "in addition , g. m. kremer analyzes the van der waals fluid @xcite by considering it at first as the only content of the universe and in second time as an additional component of the universe in more dark energy .",
    "analysis of chaplygin gas made by n. bilic et al .",
    "@xcite led to the conclusion on the effective unification of dark energy and dark matter with this gas , however , this unification is closely related to the geometry of space ( its inhomogeneous character ) .",
    "a study of the chaplygin gas through the setting of the state - finder parameters was discussed by v. gorini et al.@xcite .",
    "furthermore a global stability of chaplygin gas was shown by v. gorini et al.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the structural stability of chaplygin gas was analyzed by m. szydlowski and w. czaja@xcite .",
    "it is customary that by a cosmological analysis in @xmath13 gravity , one makes a choice either on the consideration of a lagrangian density @xmath0 and one sees the behavior of cosmological parameters by determining the scale factor @xmath14 , or by providing the scale factor and one determines the action @xmath0 by seeing the behavior of the cosmological parameters",
    ". our work would follow the second approach with _ particularity _ i.e the aim of this work is to reconstruct the action @xmath0 by interacting whenever two fluids that one considers as the only content of the universe .",
    "several studies taking into account the fluid interactions supposed form the contents of the world have been addressed on different theories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "_ the particularity _ that we are referring here is the fact that our approach although follows the second point , the reconstructed actions does not depend on the chosen scale factor , as it is often the case .",
    "the chosen scale factor is just a tool for the cosmological analysis .",
    "we will begin this work by the generality of @xmath0 gravity in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "then the approach of interactions will start by the interaction of dark energy and dark matter in vacuum , in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the section [ sec4 ] will be devoted to the interaction of dark energy and baryonic matter .",
    "the van der waals fluid and dark energy will be studied in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the section [ sec6 ] is reserved to the interaction of dark energy and chaplygin gas . and",
    "finally the conclusion will be given in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "the modified theory of gravity based on the torsion scalar is the one for which the geometric part of the action is an algebraic function depending on the torsion . in the same way as in the teleparallel gravity ,",
    "the geometric elements are described using orthonormal tetrads components defined in the tangent space at each point of the manifold . in general the line element",
    "can be written as @xmath15 where we define the following elements @xmath16 note that @xmath17 is the metric related to the minkowskian spacetime and the @xmath18 are the components of the tetrad which satisfy the following identities @xmath19 the connection in use in this theory is the one of weizenbock s , defined by @xmath20 once the previous connection is assumed , one can then express the main geometric objects ; the torsion tensor s components as@xmath21 which is used in the definition of the contorsion tensor as @xmath22 the above objects ( torsion and contorsion ) are used to define a new tensor @xmath23 as @xmath24 the torsion scalar is defined from the previous tensor and the torsion tensor as @xmath25 let us write the action for the modified @xmath0 theory with matter as follows @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28=\\sqrt{-g}$ ] denotes the determinant of the tetrad and @xmath29 the determinant of the space - time metric .",
    "we consider the geometric lagrangian density as @xmath30 the equations of motion in the flat frw universe are given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the energy density and pressure associated with a type of perfect fluid .",
    "for @xmath34 , the above equations can be rewritten as @xmath35 with @xcite @xmath36 here , the relations ( [ fr1 ] ) and ( [ fr2 ] ) are constraints equations .",
    "they will be used to determine the integration constants .",
    "furthermore , equation ( fr1 ) may be described as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 one poses @xmath39 for different graphs , we will use the scale factor introduced by s. nojiri et al . as unifying a dominated ordinary matter phase and dominated dark energy phase @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 being positive constants .",
    "+ now we will start our approach with the dark energy and dark matter .",
    "one looks at the interaction between dark energy and dark matter , so in this section we will ignore on all other form of energy or matter .",
    "thus , one assumes dark energy and dark matter densities and their respective pressures coming from the energy density and the pressure induced by the torsion . in other words ,",
    "one sets @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are densities of dark energy and dark matter and their respective pressures . considering that dark energy and dark matter are two perfect fluids that interact following the equations below @xcite . @xmath46",
    "these equations are more general in the sense that these two fluids may be considered as non - zero pressure .",
    "the derivation of equation ( [ dem ] ) with the decomposition ( [ det ] ) gives @xmath47 furthermore , from the combination of relations ( [ contde ] ) and ( [ contdm ] ) , and making use of the equation ( [ fr21 ] ) , one gets @xmath48 by combining the equations ( [ ddededm ] ) and ( [ ad ] ) , one obtains a differential equation on @xmath12 reporting about the interaction of dark energy and dark matter in the vacuum .",
    "@xmath49 a trivial solution can be given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 an interact constant . using equation ( [ fr1 ] )",
    "it follows @xmath52 .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 whether @xmath54 the nontrivial solutions of equation ( [ actdedm ] ) are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are integrations constants . from the equation ( [ fr1 ] )",
    ", one gets @xmath58 with @xmath57 arbitrary constant .",
    "then the effective equation of state parameter @xmath59 and the effective energy density parameter @xmath60 become @xmath61 it should be noted that the action ( [ actiondedm ] ) leads to the same expression for the effective energy density ( [ densite ] ) .",
    "thus , as can be seen with the expansions ( [ peff1 ] ) and ( [ peff2 ] ) , these actions are equivalent .",
    "this is not surprising because they come from the same source ( [ actdedm ] ) .",
    "thus , the lagrangian densities ( [ tt ] ) and ( [ actdedm ] ) can be used to make a cosmological study which we want to take into account the interaction between dark energy and dark matter in a universe dominated by these two components .",
    "the graph presents the evolution of @xmath62 versus @xmath63 for an universe devoid of common components where dark energy and dark matter interacting.,width=377,height=302 ]",
    "in this section as before we will look at two components as the only that dominate the universe , that is the case of dark energy and ordinary matter .",
    "then we will assume from now that torsion induces a single component that is dark energy , i.e @xmath64 .",
    "then the equations of interactions between dark energy and ordinary matter are given by @xcite @xmath65 our approach also takes into account of an ordinary matter non zero pressure .",
    "the derivation of equation ( [ dem ] ) gives @xmath66 by combining relations ( [ contde1 ] ) and ( [ contm ] ) and using the equation ( [ fr22 ] ) , one obtains @xmath67 by making use of the equations ( [ ddede ] ) and ( [ adem ] ) one gets the following differential equation @xmath68 equation ( [ actdem ] ) can be decomposed into two differential equations by the variables separation as follows @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a non - zero constant .",
    "the solutions of these equations are written in the form @xmath71 @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 integration constants . by setting @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the present cosmic time cosmic and @xmath77 the current energy density of dust .",
    "one obtains @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the current hubble parameter . by using equation ( [ fr1 ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath80 with @xmath81 an arbitrary constant .",
    "the solution ( [ act ] ) is the gravitational action in @xmath0 theory with the account of the interaction between dark energy and ordinary matter for cosmological studies in a universe dominated by dark energy and ordinary matter .",
    "the effective equation of state parameter @xmath59 and effective energy density @xmath60 parameter are given by @xmath82 for @xmath83@xcite and @xmath84 , one has    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     from figure [ fig4 ] , we see that the energy density of chaplygin gas @xmath85 tends to a constant which can be regarded as a cosmological constant because on the other side , the effective equation of state parameter @xmath59 approaches -1 .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of interaction of the dark energy with some fluids in the fralework of @xmath0 theory of gravity were @xmath1 denotes the torsion scalar .",
    "as fluid interacting with the dark energy , we undertake the ordinary matter fluid , the dark matter , the van der walls fluid and chaplygin gas .",
    "the each fluid , an expression of the pressure is assumed , according to the previous cosmological research , and the gravitational action is found through the reconstruction scheme , within more general consideration of the expansion .    in a first step",
    "the consider the interaction between the dark energy the dark matter where these mysterious components are assumed as governing the gravitational effect .",
    "then , from the reconstruction of the lagrangian action our result shows that the parameter of equation of state related to the energy read @xmath86 , corresponding to a universe driven by the cosmological constant @xmath9 . in the second step ,",
    "the reconstruction of lagrangian density @xmath0 in a universe dominated by dark energy and ordinary matter , where dark energy is considered to be of geometric origin , is considered .",
    "the energy density of ordinary matter obtained with this approach decreases over time ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , in perfect agreement with the observational data . moreover still in the spirit of studying the interaction ,",
    "the reconstruction of the action @xmath0 in a universe composed of dark energy and van der waals fluid is performed leading to a universe plunging into a phantom phase ( @xmath87 ) figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "finally we consider a universe dominated by dark energy and chaplygin gas and pass to the reconstruction of the associated gravitational action ; our results show that the energy density of chaplygin gas @xmath85 tends to a constant while the effective equation of state parameter @xmath59 tends to -1 .",
    "this result allows to interpret the energy density of chaplygin gas constant of being the cosmological constant for large cosmic time .",
