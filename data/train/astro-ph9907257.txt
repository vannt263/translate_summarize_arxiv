    "even before the discovery of the first gravitational lens system , a technique for using gravitational lenses to measure the distance scale of the universe had been developed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the technique requires a lens system in which multiple images of the background source are formed .",
    "a `` map '' of the geodesics along which the light travels to form the images is constructed and used to predict the differences in light travel times along the geodesics . if the background source is variable , these time delays can be measured as each image varies in turn .",
    "the ratios between the observed and predicted delays give the hubble constant in the assumed world model @xmath10 .",
    "the use of gravitational lenses for determining @xmath4 has major advantages over traditional `` distance ladder '' approaches .",
    "first , the technique gives a direct estimate of @xmath4 at cosmological distances , where the effects of peculiar velocities are minimal .",
    "second , this measurement of @xmath4 is obtained in one step , without the propagation of errors inherent in the distance ladder approach .    with the discovery that the `` double quasar '' 0957 + 561 a , b was a lens system ( @xcite ) , the effort to use lenses to measure @xmath4 began in earnest .",
    "for many years the effort was hindered by both the paucity of known lens systems and the difficulty in measuring time delays in the systems .",
    "in fact , an unambiguous time delay has only recently been measured in 0957 + 561 in spite of over ten years of intensive monitoring ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another of the earliest known lenses , pg  1115 + 080 ( @xcite ) , has also just produced measurable time delays ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we may have entered a new era for time delay measurements from gravitational lenses .",
    "one reason for this is the accelerated rate of discovery of new lenses from systematic radio surveys .",
    "the jodrell - vla astrometric survey ( jvas ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) has produced 6 new lenses , and time delays have been measured for one of them ( b0218357 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ongoing cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) has found 12 new lenses since it began in 1994 .",
    "this paper reports the first measurement of time delays from a class lens .",
    "the class project is a large search for gravitational lenses with the vla , with an explicit goal of finding lens systems which can be used to measure @xmath4 .",
    "the gravitational lens b1608 + 656 ( ra : 16 09 13.956 , dec : + 65 32 28.971 , j2000 ) was observed in the first phase of class and was immediately recognized as a lens system .",
    "the radio discovery image shows four unresolved components in a typical lens geometry ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_1608map ] for a map of the system ) .",
    "the system was also discovered in a search for gigahertz - peaked spectrum sources and was found to be the lensed core of a classical radio double source ( @xcite ) .",
    "further investigations of the system have provided data crucial for using the system for measuring @xmath4 .",
    "we have measured the lens redshift ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) and source redshift ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "optical and infrared observations taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ reveal that the background source is being lensed by a pair of possibly merging galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the positions of the lensing galaxies relative to the lensed images are important constraints on models of the lensing potential ( @xcite ; hereafter paper 2 ) .",
    "the hst images also show arcs due to the lensing of stellar emission from the background source .",
    "these arcs could be used as further constraints of the lens model .",
    "flat - spectrum cores of radio galaxies such as the lensed object in b1608 + 656 are often variable . to test for variability in the b1608 + 656 background source",
    ", we made several observations of the system with the vla , separated by time - scales of months .",
    "these data showed that the flux density of the background source varied by up to 15% .",
    "the variability makes b1608 + 656 an excellent candidate for a dedicated monitoring program to determine time delays .",
    "this paper presents the results of vla monitoring from october 1996 to may 1997 .",
    "these observations have resulted in the measurement of the three independent time delays in the b1608 + 656 system and a subsequent determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the hubble constant is expressed as @xmath13 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath14 .",
    "the effect of varying the cosmological model is treated in paper 2 .",
    "we observed b1608 + 656 between 1996 october 10 and 1997 may 09 , during which time the vla was in the a , bna , and b configurations .",
    "the 64 epochs were separated , on average , by 3.6  d. the observations were carried out at 8.5  ghz , giving angular resolutions ranging from 025 to 07 in the different array configurations .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "the typical observation is 60  min long and includes scans on b1608 + 656 , a flux calibrator ( 3c286 or 3c48 ) , a phase calibrator ( 1642 + 689 ) chosen from the vla calibrator list ( @xcite ) , and two secondary flux calibrators ( 1634 + 627 and 1633 + 741 ) .",
    "the secondary flux calibrators are nearby steep - spectrum sources that are not expected to vary over the time - scales of the observations .",
    "we observe these sources to determine corrections for errors in the absolute flux calibration from epoch to epoch .",
    "the basic observing pattern is :    * 1642 + 689 ( 1 min on source ) * 1634 + 627 ( 1 min on source ) * b1608 + 656 ( 46 min on source ) * 1633 + 741 ( 2 min on source )    a typical 60  min observation begins with a 9  10  min scan ( including slew time ) on the flux calibrator , contains three repetitions of the basic pattern on b1608 + 656 , and ends with scans on 1642 + 689 ( 1  min ) and the flux calibrator again ( @xmath03  min ) .",
    "for the few observations that are 30  min or 90  min in length , the number of repetitions of the basic pattern is altered .",

    "moore & hewitt ( 1997 ) , in their analysis of the 15  ghz light curves of the gravitational lens mg  0414 + 0534 , developed objective criteria to flag questionable data .",

    "we have noted all epochs satisfying their criteria in the `` comments '' column of table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "however , we are able to include many of these points in our analysis because observations at 8.5  ghz are less sensitive to the observing conditions than are observations taken at 15  ghz . as such , we have only excluded epochs for which the data are severely affected by the observing conditions .",
    "this assessment is made by examining the light curves of the secondary calibrator sources .",

    "+    the errors on the final flux densities in table  [ tab_complcurve ] are a combination of additive and multiplicative terms .",
    "the additive uncertainty is well - approximated by the rms noise in the residual map at the end of the model - fitting .",
    "the multiplicative term is indicative of how well the model - fitting procedure is able to find the `` true '' total flux density of a source .",
    "we estimate this error by calculating the ratio of the flux densities of 1634 + 627 and 1633 + 741 , which we expect not to vary with respect to each other .",
    "the flux density ratio is not affected by errors in the absolute flux calibration , so any scatter in the ratio can be attributed to errors in the model fitting procedure . from the scatter in the flux density ratio , we estimate the fractional error in the component flux densities to be 0.9% ; the product of the component flux densities and this value gives the multiplicative uncertainty .",
    "the final errors on the flux densities are a combination in quadrature of the additive and multiplicative terms .",
    "for the three brightest components ( a , b , and c ) , the multiplicative terms dominate ; for component d the multiplicative and additive terms are comparable .    the flux density of a lensed image of the background source is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the true flux density of the background source and @xmath32 is the magnification associated with the @xmath33 ( unresolved ) image .",
    "similarly , the lensed images will vary by @xmath34 if the flux density of the background source changes by an amount @xmath35 .",
    "hence , any variations in the b1608 + 656 component light curves that are due to variations in the background source must have the same _ fractional _ amplitudes in all four curves .",
    "for this reason , the component light curves presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_w08 ] and [ fig_wflat08 ] are divided by their mean flux densities to allow direct comparison of the fractional variations in the curves .",
    "the mean values used to normalize the light curves are 34.29 , 16.79 , 17.41 , and 5.884  mjy for components a , b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "all four light curves show variations in flux density at the @xmath05% level , and there are common features that can be seen in each .",
    "each light curve shows a rise of @xmath05% in flux density , followed by a plateau lasting @xmath020  d and then a drop of @xmath04% .",
    "models of the b1608 + 656 system predict that , if the background source is variable , the lensed images will vary in the order b @xmath15 a @xmath15 c @xmath15 d ( @xcite ; paper 2 ) .",
    "this is , in fact , the behavior seen in the b1608 + 656 light curves . in order to determine time delays between component",
    "b and the other three components , we have used three statistical methods : ( 1 ) smoothing and @xmath23 minimization , ( 2 ) smoothing and cross - correlation , and ( 3 ) dispersion analysis ( pelt et al .  1994 , 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the methods are discussed below .",
    "all of the analysis has been performed on both the `` phasecal '' and `` gscale '' data sets (  [ sec_1608maps ] ) .",
    "no significant differences in the results are seen , so we present only the results from the `` gscale '' set in the subsequent discussion .      the first two methods of determining the time delays from the b1608 + 656 light curves require that the observed data be transferred onto a regular grid .",
    "some previous determinations of time delays ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have accomplished this transfer by linear interpolation of the data .",
    "however , the flux density variations seen in the b1608 + 656 images are small compared to the noise in the curves ; therefore , linear interpolation can amplify noise spikes .",
    "in contrast , smoothing reduces the effects of noise compared to the true variations , if the variations have typical time - scales significantly longer than the sampling interval .",
    "we smooth and re - sample the data by calculating the weighted mean of points within a smoothing window that is moved from the beginning to the end of the observations in regular steps .",
    "the step size is set to one day .",
    "we smooth each light curve with several different functions to avoid biasing the results by our choice of weighting function or window size . for completeness",
    ", we also include the results obtained from interpolating the data by piecewise linear interpolation .",
    "we use the following smoothing schemes : ( 1 ) boxcar - weighted mean , ( 2 ) triangle - weighted mean , ( 3 ) gaussian - weighted mean , ( 4 ) boxcar - weighted mean with a variable - width smoothing window , and ( 5 ) triangle - weighted mean with a variable - width window . in the last two schemes ,",
    "the width of the smoothing window is varied such that the same number of points are always included in the window .",
    "we use 3 , 5 , and 7 point windows for these methods .",
    "for the fixed - width window schemes , we smooth with window widths of 5 , 10 , and 15  d. the gaussian smoothing scheme uses values of @xmath25 equal to 3 , 5 , and 7  d. in addition to multiplying by the value of the smoothing function , the data points are also variance - weighted .",
    "thus , the overall weighting on a point at @xmath36 which is being used to calculate a weighted mean at @xmath37 is : @xmath38},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the value of the smoothing function ( e.g. , g(t ) = 1 for boxcar smoothing ) , @xmath40 is the uncertainty on the flux density at @xmath36 ( calculated in  [ flat ] ) , and the sum is over the points used to calculate the mean .",
    "the variance of the weighted mean @xmath41 at @xmath37 in the smoothed curve then becomes @xmath42 \\right ) ^2 } \\sum_i \\frac{[g(t_i - t_k)]^2}{\\sigma_i^2 } , \\label{eqn_var_wmean}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 is taken as the uncertainty in the smoothed flux density at that step .      for the @xmath23 minimization technique ,",
    "we compare two light curves , one of which is designated the `` control '' curve and the other of which is designated the `` comparison '' curve .",
    "both curves are smoothed , and then the comparison curve is multiplied by a scale factor @xmath22 so that its mean flux density is comparable to that of the control curve .",
    "after this scaling , the comparison curve is shifted in time by an amount @xmath44 with respect to the control curve .",
    "we form a grid of @xmath45 pairs and calculate the @xmath23 statistic at each grid point .",
    "the step size for @xmath44 used in the grid is 1  d and the minimum and maximum shifts are set to @xmath29114  d , i.e. , half of the total length of the observations .",
    "the amplitude scale factors are set as percentages of the scale factor @xmath46 that equalizes the mean flux densities of the two curves being compared .",
    "the scale factors used in the grid range from 0.9@xmath46 to 1.1@xmath46 , in steps of 0.001@xmath46 .",
    "one result of the smoothing and interpolation performed on the input light curves is that the points in the interpolated curves are no longer independent . when computing the reduced @xmath23 statistic we estimate an effective number of independent points , @xmath47 , in the overlapping region between the shifted and unshifted curves .",
    "this quantity is set to the number of points that would have been present in the overlapping region if the original light curves had been regularly sampled at the average spacing of 3.7  d. this simplifying assumption should not significantly affect the quantity in which we are interested , which is the location of the minimum on the @xmath23 surface .",
    "in fact , the @xmath23-minimization method finds delays that match closely those found from the completely non - interpolative dispersion method (  [ dispersion ] ) , indicating the robustness of the delays determined from this method .",
    "we repeat the @xmath23 minimization three times , once for each independent pair of light curves . the component b light curve is always taken as the control curve . in the three repetitions of the @xmath23 minimization , the comparison curves are a , c , and d , respectively .",
    "the minimum delay is found by fitting a parabola to the points at the minimum of the gridded @xmath23 curve .",
