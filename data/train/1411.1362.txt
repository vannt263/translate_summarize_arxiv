    "this paper aims at the global regularity issue on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) boussinesq equations with fractional dissipation @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the 2d velocity , @xmath10 the pressure , @xmath11 the temperature , @xmath12 the unit vector in the vertical direction , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real parameters .",
    "here @xmath17 represents the zygmund operator with @xmath18 being defined through the fourier transform , @xmath19 where the fourier transform is given by @xmath20 when @xmath21 , ( [ bqe ] ) reduces to the standard 2d boussinesq equations with laplacian dissipation .",
    "the standard boussinesq equations model geophysical flows such as atmospheric fronts and oceanic circulation , and also play an important role in the study of raleigh - bernard convection ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    ".1 in although ( [ bqe ] ) with fractional dissipation appears to be a purely mathematical generalization , ( [ bqe ] ) may be physically relevant .",
    "first , closely related equations such as the surface quasi - geostrophic equation model important geophysical phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , there are geophysical circumstances in which the boussinesq equations with fractional laplacian may arise",
    ". flows in the middle atmosphere traveling upward undergo changes due to the changes of atmospheric properties , although the incompressibility and boussinesq approximations are applicable .",
    "the effect of kinematic and thermal diffusion is attenuated by the thinning of atmosphere .",
    "this anomalous attenuation can be modeled by using the space fractional laplacian ( see @xcite ) .",
    "third , it may be possible to derive the boussinesq equations with fractional dissipation from the boltzmann - type equations using suitable rescalings .",
    "a recent paper @xcite derives the fractional stokes and stokes - fourier systems as the incompressible limit of the boltzmann equation .",
    ".1 in mathematically the 2d boussinesq equations serve as a lower dimensional model of the 3d hydrodynamics equations .",
    "in fact , the 2d boussinesq equations retain some key features of the 3d navier - stokes and the euler equations such as the vortex stretching mechanism .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the inviscid boussinesq equations can be identified with the 3d euler equations for axisymmetric flows .",
    "it is hoped that the study on the 2d boussinesq equations will shed light on the mysterious global existence and smoothness problem on the 3d navier - stokes and euler equations .",
    "the generalization to include the fractional dissipation facilitates this purpose by allowing the simultaneous study of a whole parameter family of equations .",
    ".1 in one main pursuit in the study of ( [ bqe ] ) has been to obtain the global regularity of its solutions for the smallest @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively , the smaller @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , the harder the global regularity problem is .",
    "when there is no dissipation , namely @xmath24 in ( [ bqe ] ) , the global regularity problem remains open .",
    "the standard idea of proving the global _ a priori _ bounds in sobolev spaces fails .",
    "potential finite time singularities have been explored from different perspectives including boundary effects and 1d models ( @xcite ) .",
    ".1 in at the other extremum , when @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 , the global regularity can be easily obtained , in a similar fashion as for the 2d navier - stokes equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to examine ( [ bqe ] ) with intermediate dissipation , which has attracted considerable attention in the last few years ( @xcite ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that one full laplacian dissipation in ( [ bqe ] ) is sufficient for the global regularity . more precisely , ( [ bqe ] ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 or with @xmath27 and @xmath28 always possesses global classical solutions .",
    ".1 in more recent work further reduces the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 and existing research appears to indicate that one - derivative dissipation is critical . here",
    "one - derivative dissipation refers to the case when @xmath29 in ( [ bqe ] ) . for the convenience of description , @xmath30",
    "is referred to as the critical case , @xmath31 as the subcritical case while @xmath32 as the supercritical case . to position our work in a suitable context",
    ", we describe some recent results for these three cases .",
    ".1 in we start with the subcritical case .",
    "even this case is not easy .",
    "the global regularity has so far been established only for three subcritical cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "the global existence and regularity problem for the critical case is more difficult .",
    "two particular critical cases , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , were studied by @xcite and @xcite , which introduced a combined quantity of the vorticity and the riesz transform of the temperature and were able to establish the global regularity for both cases . for the more general critical case when the one derivative dissipation is split between the velocity equation and the temperature equation ,",
    "the situation becomes more complex .",
    "the general critical case was recently dealt with by jiu , miao , wu and zhang and a global regularity result was obtained @xcite . by reducing the global regularity issue on the critical boussinesq system to a parallel problem for an active scalar equation with critical dissipation or , more precisely , the critical surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation and taking advantage of the recent advances on the sqg equation , jiu , miao , wu and zhang obtained the global regularity in the critical regime : @xmath30 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "attempts have also been made to go beyond the critical case and the global regularity has been established when the dissipation is logarithmically more singular than the critical case ( @xcite ) .",
    "the global well - posedness problem for the supercritical case @xmath37 is completely open .",
    "the only result currently available is the eventual regularity of weak solutions to ( [ bqe ] ) with @xmath32 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    ".1 in this paper establishes the global existence and regularity of classical solutions to ( [ bqe ] ) when @xmath22 and @xmath23 are in the critical range : @xmath29 and @xmath38 .",
    "this result improves the work of jiu , miao , wu and zhang @xcite by allowing @xmath22 to vary in a bigger interval , by keeping the relation @xmath39 .",
    "the precise statement of our result is given in the following theorem .",
    "[ main ] consider ( [ bqe ] ) with @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "if the parameters in ( [ bqe ] ) satisfies @xmath42 then ( [ bqe ] ) has a unique global solution @xmath43 satisfying , for any @xmath44 , @xmath45 ; h^\\sigma(\\mathbb{r}^2)).\\ ] ]    .1 in we outline the main idea in the proof of this theorem and explain how we improved @xcite .",
    "a large portion of the efforts are devoted to obtaining global _ a priori _ bounds for @xmath43 .",

    "for notational convenience , we set @xmath57 in ( [ bqe ] ) throughout the rest of this paper .",

    "in fact , we are able to show the global bound for @xmath64 whenever @xmath65 and @xmath30 .",
    "the major contribution of this paper is on the global @xmath66-bound for @xmath59 .",
    "previously , for @xmath67 and @xmath30 , @xcite obtained a global bound for @xmath68 for @xmath69 in the range @xmath70 obviously @xmath71 when @xmath72 .",
    "we are able to significantly enlarge the range of @xmath69 .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following proposition .    [ prop : lq ] let @xmath73 and @xmath29 , with @xmath74 let @xmath75 be as specified in theorem [ main ] and let @xmath43 be the corresponding smooth solution of ( [ bqe ] ) .",
    "assume @xmath59 satisfies ( [ geqin ] ) .",
    "then , for any @xmath44 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant depending on @xmath79 and the initial data @xmath75 .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop : lq ] involves the decomposition of the velocity field @xmath80 commutator estimates and various functional inequalities .",
    "proposition [ prop : lq ] is crucial in further showing that @xmath59 is actually globally regular in the sense that @xmath81 and for any @xmath44 and @xmath76 , where @xmath78 is a constant depending on @xmath79 and the initial data @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath82 denotes an inhomogeneous besov space ( see section [ sec : pre ] for more details on besov spaces ) .",
    "once proposition [ prop : lq ] is established , the proof of ( [ greg ] ) is similar to proposition 7.1 in @xcite .",
    "a special consequence of ( [ greg ] ) is that @xmath83 , which in turn implies that @xmath84 defined in ( [ ugut ] ) is lipschitz , @xmath85 then ( [ ugut ] ) with the equation of @xmath86 can be treated as a generalized critical sqg equation , which leads to the global regularity of @xmath43 following a similar approach as in @xcite .",
