    "each orbit @xmath17 gives an induced representation @xmath18 of the associated transformation - group @xmath0-algebra @xmath19 which is irreducible , and the @xmath20-times convergence of @xmath15 in the orbit space to @xmath6 translates into statements about various multiplicity numbers associated to @xmath21 in the spectrum of @xmath19 , as in ( * ? ? ?",

    "upper and lower multiplicity numbers associated to irreducible representations @xmath22 of a @xmath0-algebra @xmath23 were introduced by archbold @xcite and extended to multiplicity numbers relative to a net of irreducible representations by archbold and spielberg @xcite .",
    "the upper multiplicity @xmath24 of @xmath22 , for example , counts ` the number of nets of orthogonal equivalent pure states which can converge to a common pure state associated to @xmath22 ' @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath20-times convergence and ( * ? ? ?",

    "* theorem  2.4 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem  5.8 ) ) .",
    "theorem  1.1 of @xcite shows that the topological property of a sequence @xmath15 converging @xmath20-times in the orbit space to @xmath6 is equivalent to ( 1 ) a measure theoretic accumulation along the orbits @xmath25 and ( 2 ) that the lower multiplicity of @xmath21 relative to the sequence @xmath26 is at least @xmath20 .",
    "in chapter [ chapter_strength_of_convergence ] we prove that the results of @xcite generalise to principal groupoids . in our main arguments",
    "we have tried to preserve as much as possible the structure of those in @xcite , although the arguments presented here are often more complicated in order to cope with the partially defined product in a groupoid and the set of measures that is a haar system compared to the fixed haar measure used in the transformation - group case .",
    "our theorems have led us to a new class of examples exhibiting @xmath20-times convergence in groupoids that are not based on transformation groups , thus justifying our level of generality . given a row - finite directed graph @xmath27 , kumjian , pask , raeburn and renault in @xcite used the set of all infinite paths in @xmath27 to construct an @xmath28-discrete groupoid @xmath29 , called a _",
    "path groupoid_. we prove that @xmath29 is principal if and only if @xmath27 contains no cycles ( proposition  [ prop_principal_iff_no_cycles ] ) .",
    "we then exhibit principal @xmath29 with hausdorff and non - hausdorff orbits space , respectively , both with a @xmath20-times converging sequence in the orbit space .",
    "in particular , our examples can be used to find a groupoid @xmath29 whose @xmath0-algebra has non - hausdorff spectrum and distinct upper and lower multiplicity counts among its irreducible representations .    the directed graphs demonstrating @xmath20-times convergence in the orbit space of the associated path groupoids were carefully chosen so that the path groupoids would be principal , integrable and not cartan .",
    "the search for examples of directed graphs with these properties provided the initial motivation for the research that is introduced in the following section .",
    "kumjian and pask in @xcite introduced the notion of a higher - rank graph and , for row - finite higher - rank graph @xmath30 without sources , defined the cuntz - krieger higher - rank graph @xmath0-algebra , denoted @xmath31 .",
    "these @xmath0-algebras were introduced as generalisations of the directed - graph @xmath0-algebras developed by kumjian , pask , raeburn and renault in @xcite .",
    "the class of higher - rank graph @xmath0-algebras is signifantly larger than the already large class of @xmath0-algebras associated to directed graphs ( see raeburn s",
    "book @xcite for an overview ) . as with the @xmath0-algebras associated to",
    "directed graphs , the study of the @xmath0-algebras of higher - rank graphs initially used the theory of groupoids .",
    "a more recent `` bare hands '' approach to studying higher - rank graphs has been developed that avoids the use of groupoids with the aim of simplifying arguments .",
    "these groupoid models have recently been seen to be a useful source of examples with their use to illustrate groupoid results in @xcite and in chapter [ chapter_strength_of_convergence ] .",

    "@xmath31 is postliminal , liminal and fell , and when it has bounded- and countinuous - trace .",
    "clark in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6.1 ) showed that a groupoid @xmath0-algebra is liminal if and only if the orbits in the groupoid are closed and the @xmath0-algebras of each of the stability subgroups are liminal . in section [ sec_liminal_postliminal ] we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on @xmath30 for the orbits in @xmath32 to be closed ; we use this to show exactly when @xmath31 is liminal .",
    "similarly we provide a condition on @xmath30 that is necessary and sufficient for the orbits in @xmath32 to be locally closed and use another of clark s results , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7.1 ) , to show precisely when @xmath31 is postliminal .",
    "in section [ sec_bded - trace_cts - trace_fell ] we will develop necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath30 for @xmath32 to be integrable , to be cartan and to be proper . with the assumption that @xmath32 is principal we will use results by clark and an huef in @xcite , clark in @xcite and muhly and williams in @xcite to determine exactly when @xmath31 has bounded trace , is fell , and has continuous trace . in section [ sec_boundary_paths_and_desourcification ]",
    "we introduce the desourcification construction that webster developed in @xcite based on farthing s @xcite and in section [ sec_desourcification ] we use the desourcification construction to provide similar characterisations of @xmath31 while permitting the @xmath20-graphs to have sources .",
    "finally in section [ section_directed_graphs ] it will be shown how these results can be simplified for directed graphs and how they relate to the directed graph characterisations developed by ephrem in @xcite and by deicke , hong and szymaski in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that farthing , muhly and yeend in @xcite developed groupoid models of row - finite higher - rank graphs that may have sources .",
    "developing characterisations for one of these groupoids would have made the section using the farthing - webster desourcification , section [ sec_desourcification ] , unnecessary .",
    "this extra level of groupoid generality does , however , come at a cost to their simplicity that makes them less attractive as a source of groupoid examples . by separating the groupoid arguments from the arguments dealing with row - finite higher - rank graphs that may have sources , webster s desourcification also enables us to simplify our arguments .",
    "this chapter provides a brief overview of the theory of groupoids , beginning with renault s definition of a groupoid from @xcite .",
