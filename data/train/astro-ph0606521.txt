    "in addition , the relative fraction of red and blue galaxies and the shape of the luminosity function of red galaxies over change dramatically with density _ inside _ the virial radius @xcite .",
    "these results imply that the evolution of dwarf galaxies is primarily driven by mechanisms directly related to the structure to which the galaxy is bound , such as suffocation ( whereby galaxies lose their halo gas reservoir to the host halo ) , galaxy harassment and/or ram - pressure stripping .",
    "these differences in the environmental trends and evolution of high- and low - mass galaxies are most likely related to the observed strong bimodality in the properties of galaxies around a stellar mass of , with more massive galaxies predominately passive red spheroids , and less massive galaxies tending to be blue star - forming disks ( * ? ? ?",

    "giant galaxies are on average 17gyr older than dwarfs .",
    "moreover as density decreases , the age distribution of giant galaxies _ extends _ to include ever lower ages , while that of dwarf galaxies gets younger but also _ narrows _ , so that at the lowest densities only young ( @xmath20gyr ) galaxies are found .",

    "the giant galaxy population in the centers of clusters or groups are predominantly old , whereas in regions outside of any structure , there is a complete range of galaxy ages with an equal interspersed mixture of both young and old galaxy populations , indicating that their evolution is driven primarily by their merger history rather than by direct interactions with their large - scale environment .",
    "in contrast , the mean stellar ages of dwarf galaxies are strongly correlated with environment : while the cores of the richest clusters are still dominated by old galaxies , elsewhere almost all of the dwarf galaxies are dominated by young stars , and of the few remaining old galaxies _ all _ are found in either poor groups or from an old giant galaxy .    as an independent observation of these effects , fig .",

    "[ d4000spatial ] , the spatial distributions of dwarf and giant galaxies without h@xmath1 emission are completely different : whereas the passive giant galaxies are found _ throughout _ the region covered , passive dwarf galaxies are very strongly concentrated towards the cluster environments , with located within the virial radius of one of the clusters or groups ( shown by green circles ) . in addition , as before ,",
    "_ none _ of the passive dwarf galaxies are found to be isolated : those not in one of the clusters or groups are associated with an @xmath23 galaxy , and often these neighbors are more luminous yet , having or ( shown as open black squares ) .",
    "using two independent indicators of the past and present star - formation in galaxies , we present a clear demonstration of the quite different relationships between star - formation and environment for giant and dwarf galaxies .",
    "as found in previous studies , giant galaxies show a gradual transition from being classed as old or passive in the cluster cores , to field regions beyond where still are classed as passive .",
    "these results can be understood in the context of massive galaxies becoming passive through galaxy - galaxy interactions : the finding of both passive and star - forming galaxies in all environments reflects its stochastic nature and its independence from large - scale structure .",
    "the gradual overall trend reflects the increasing probability with density for a galaxy to have undergone a major merger in its lifetime .",
    "in contrast the dwarf galaxy population ( mag ) shows a sharp transition at , from being predominantly old and passive within the cluster , to outside where virtually all galaxies are young and forming stars , and passive galaxies are _ only _ found as satellites to more massive galaxies .",
    "these findings are supported by the observed dependencies of galaxy clustering on luminosity and color , in which the galaxies associated with the most overdense regions on @xmath24mpc scales are found to be both the bright and faint red galaxies @xcite .",
    "these dependencies were successfully reproduced by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics cosmological simulations of @xcite , who identify the passive low - mass galaxies as satellites within more massive halos .",
    "the observation that no passive dwarf galaxies are found in isolated ( with respect to galaxies ) low - density regions implies that galaxy merging can not be effective in completely terminating star - formation in low - mass galaxies , particularly as in this study these regions represent the infall regions of the supercluster where low - velocity encounters should be most frequent .",
    "low - mass galaxies become passive only when they become satellites within a more massive dm halo and their halo gas reservoir is lost to that of the host , `` suffocating '' the galaxy @xcite , or through directly cluster - related mechanisms such as galaxy harassment and/or ram - pressure stripping .",
    "these differences can be understood in the context of the hot and cold gas infall @xcite or agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) models of galaxy evolution .",
    "when gas - rich galaxies merge , tidal forces trigger a starburst and fuel the rapid growth of the central black hole , until outflows from the agn drive out the remaining cold gas from the galaxy , rapidly terminating the starburst . in massive galaxies ,",
    "the gas in the halo is also heated by stable virial shocks , and is prevented from cooling by feedback from quiescent accretion of the hot gas onto the black hole , effectively shutting down star - formation @xcite . because black hole growth is strongly dependent on galaxy mass , agn feedback in low - mass galaxies is much less efficient at expelling cold gas or affecting star - formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , low - mass galaxies self - regulate their star - formation through supernova feedback , preventing starbursts that exhaust the cold gas , which in turn is constantly replenished by cold streams , so that their ability to maintain star - formation over many gyr is much less affected by their merger history .",
