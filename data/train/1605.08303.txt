    "<S> the alice collaboration has recently measured the correlations between amplitudes of anisotropic flow in different fourier harmonics , referred to as symmetric cumulants . </S>",
    "<S> we derive approximate relations between symmetric cumulants involving @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the event - plane correlations measured by atlas . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of these relations is tested using event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results are in better agreement with alice data than existing hydrodynamic predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we make quantitative predictions for three symmetric cumulants which are not yet measured .    </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic flow is the key observable showing that the matter produced in an ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collision behaves collectively as a fluid  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following the discovery of flow fluctuations  @xcite and triangular flow  @xcite , a `` flow paradigm '' has emerged , which states that particles are emitted independently ( up to short - range correlations ) but with a momentum distribution that fluctuates event to event  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal ( @xmath2 ) distribution in a given event is written as a fourier series : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( complex ) anisotropic flow coefficient in the @xmath5th harmonic , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> both the magnitude  @xcite and phase  @xcite of @xmath7 fluctuate event to event . in the last five years or so </S>",
    "<S> , an extremely rich phenomenology has emerged from this simple paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> rms values of @xmath8 have been measured up to @xmath9  @xcite , and more recently , the full probability distribution of @xmath8  @xcite . an even wider variety of new observables can be constructed by combining different fourier harmonics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this new direction was pioneered by the alice collaboration which measured the angular correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite , and then explored systematically by the atlas collaboration which analyzed fourteen mixed correlations involving relative phases between fourier harmonics , dubbed event - plane correlations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the alice collaboration has taken a new step in this direction  @xcite by measuring the correlation between the magnitudes of different fourier harmonics using a cumulant analysis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we define the normalized symmetric cumulant @xmath12   with @xmath13 by @xmath14 alice has measured @xmath15 and @xmath16 as a function of centrality . while these two quantities are formally similar , the hydrodynamic mechanisms giving rise to these correlations differ . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow , @xmath17 , and triangular flow , @xmath18 , are both determined to a good approximation by linear response to the anisotropies of the initial density profile in the corresponding harmonics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath15 directly reflects correlations present in the initial spatial density profile , which are preserved by the hydrodynamic evolution as the spatial anisotropy is converted into a momentum anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> standard models for the initial density indeed reproduce the negative sign and overall ( small ) magnitude of the measured @xmath15 for all centralities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , @xmath19 gets a significant nonlinear contribution proportional to @xmath20 generated by the hydrodynamic evolution  @xcite in addition to the linear contribution from the initial anisotropy in the fourth harmonic  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear response explains  @xcite the large event - plane correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it also explains qualitatively why @xmath16 is positive .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a proportionality relation between @xmath16 and the corresponding event - plane correlation , where the proportionality constant involves the fluctuations of @xmath17 . using this </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to relate recent alice measurements with previously measured quantities , which circumvents the most typical limitation of hydrodynamic predictions that depend on initial conditions or medium properties  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sole assumption underlying our derivation is that the linear and nonlinear contributions to @xmath19 are independent . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this assumption is tested using hydrodynamic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath16 derived using our relation and previous atlas measurements is compared with the recent direct measurement by alice . </S>",
    "<S> we make predictions along the same lines for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are not yet measured .     </S>",
    "<S> schematic picture of the relation between the event - plane angle @xmath24 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pearson ] ) and the decomposition eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ decomposition ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the legs of the triangle correspond to the rms values of the linear and nonlinear parts , and the hypothenuse is the rms @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar figure can be drawn for @xmath25 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we decompose @xmath19 and @xmath25 into linear and non - linear parts  @xcite @xmath26 we define @xmath27 and @xmath28 in such a way that the linear correlations between linear and nonlinear parts vanish , that is , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce a measure of the relative magnitude of the linear and nonlinear parts via the pearson correlation coefficients between @xmath19 , or @xmath25 , and their nonlinear parts : @xmath30 where @xmath24 and @xmath31 lie between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the first angle </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 corresponds precisely to the event - plane correlation measured by atlas  @xcite and denoted by @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> , in contrast to the results obtained using the event - plane method  @xcite . ] the second angle @xmath31 almost corresponds to the quantity denoted by @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is that the latter has @xmath36 in the denominator , instead of @xmath37  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the precise relation is @xmath38 where @xmath15 is defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defsc ] ) .    inserting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ decomposition ] ) into eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we now assume that the linear parts @xmath40 and @xmath41 are statistically independent of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a stronger statement than just assuming that the linear correlation vanishes . as will be shown below , it is a reasonable approximation in hydrodynamics </S>",
    "<S> . then , only the nonlinear response contributes to the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath17 , and eq .  ( [ decomposition ] ) gives : @xmath42 similar relations can be written for the correlations between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 or @xmath44 . substituting in @xmath27 and @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> extracted from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cos2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath47 these equations express symmetric cumulants in terms of event - plane correlations and moments of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> based on these equations , one expects symmetric cumulants involving @xmath0 or @xmath1 to increase with viscosity , in the same way as event - plane correlations  @xcite .    in order to test eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) , we carry out event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations using the same setup as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : initial conditions are given by the monte - carlo glauber model  @xcite , the shear viscosity over entropy ratio is @xmath48  @xcite within the viscous relativistic hydrodynamical model v - usphydro @xcite , and @xmath7 is calculated at freeze - out  @xcite for pions in the transverse momentum range @xmath49  gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the particular setup used , and whether or not it quantitatively reproduces experimental data , is irrelevant in this context , since the statement is that eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) should hold to a good approximation for _ any _ hydrodynamic calculation . in hydrodynamics </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 can be computed exactly from the one - particle momentum distribution for each event  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , reasonable accuracy is obtained with fewer events than in an actual experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we generate 1000 events for each 5% centrality bin . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : hydro ] displays the comparison between the left - hand side ( symbols ) and the right - hand side ( dark shaded bands ) of eqs .  ( [ exactrelations ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> agreement is good for all four quantities and all centralities , in the sense that the absolute difference is typically a few @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> has the same sign for almost all centralities . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical error bar on this difference is in the range @xmath51 , smaller than the difference itself . ] </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the magnitude of of @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) and that of @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) are not quite independent in hydrodynamics , but have a slight negative correlation </S>",
    "<S> . however , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) correctly capture the sign , magnitude and centrality dependence of symmetric cumulants .     </S>",
    "<S> open symbols : alice data for @xmath16  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> closed symbols : value obtained using the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) using atlas data for the moments of @xmath17  @xcite and the event - plane correlation  @xcite . ]    the equation for @xmath16 can also be tested against existing data . </S>",
    "<S> the left - hand side has been measured by alice  @xcite while the quantities entering the right - hand side ( moments of the @xmath17 distribution , event - plane correlation ) have been measured by atlas . </S>",
    "<S> alice and atlas have different acceptances , both in transverse momentum ( @xmath52 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath53 ) , so that the comparison is not quite apples to apples . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that the quantities entering eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) ( ratios of moments , event - plane correlations ) depend weakly on the @xmath52 range . the effect of the acceptance in @xmath53 will be discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> the moments of @xmath17 are not measured directly but can be expressed  @xcite as a function of the cumulants @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are measured  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the atlas @xmath54 is biased by nonflow correlations since no rapidity gap is implemented ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 are expected to be free of nonflow correlations whether or not there is a gap ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have compared the ratios @xmath57 from alice  @xcite ( where @xmath54 has a gap ) and atlas ( where @xmath54 has no gap ) and found that they are compatible , which suggests that the nonflow contribution to the integrated @xmath54 measured by atlas is small ( nonflow effects are known to be large at high @xmath52 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : sc42 ] displays the comparison between the left - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) measured by alice  @xcite and the right - hand side using atlas data . </S>",
    "<S> agreement is reasonable for all centralities . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , our data - driven approach gives a better result for @xmath16 than existing hydrodynamic predictions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the hydrodynamic calculation of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] , one would expect that the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) is larger than the left - hand side . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is the other way around above 30% centrality . </S>",
    "<S> one reason may be that the event - plane correlation for atlas uses a much larger pseudorapidity window ( @xmath58 ) than alice ( @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , the phase of @xmath7 depends slightly on rapidity  @xcite , which induces a decoherence of azimuthal correlations for larger @xmath60 @xcite . due to these longitudinal flow fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> the event - plane correlation measured by atlas is smaller than what alice would measure in a more central rapidity window . ideally , the comparison between the two sides of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) should be done in the exact same rapidity window .    </S>",
    "<S> we now make predictions for @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the right - hand sides involve the mixed moments @xmath61 and @xmath62 which could be measured directly  @xcite but are not yet measured . however , the alice collaboration measures @xmath63 for all centralities  @xcite , which implies @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can assume , as a first approximation , that @xmath46 and @xmath44 are independent . for consistency s sake </S>",
    "<S> , we also neglect the correlation in evaluating @xmath31 , i.e. , we make the approximation @xmath65 ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi235 ] ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] ( c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> agreement is excellent for central collisions but becomes worse as the centrality percentile increases , as expected since we have neglected @xmath15 which becomes sizable for peripheral collisions .     </S>",

    "<S> if one assumes that @xmath46 and @xmath44 are independent , the second line of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exactrelations ] ) gives @xmath67 . in order to obtain a non - trivial prediction for @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , we need to take into account the small correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by assuming that @xmath44 can be decomposed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the same for all events in a centrality class , and @xmath70 is independent of @xmath46 . using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2v3 ] ) , the correlation between an arbitrary moment of @xmath17 and @xmath44 is given in terms of moments of @xmath17 : @xmath71 the first equation relates @xmath69 with @xmath15 through eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is very close to the dark - shaded banded for all centralities , thus showing that the decomposition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v2v3 ] ) appropriately takes into account the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ approxrelations2 ] ) ( moments of @xmath17 and @xmath73 ) are interpolated from atlas data , since alice and atlas use different centrality bins .    </S>",
    "<S> we have derived proportionality relations between symmetric cumulants involving @xmath0 or @xmath1 and event - plane correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these relations link correlations of different orders ( symmetric cumulants are 4-particle correlations , while event - plane correlations are 3-particle correlations ) and are fully non trivial . </S>",
    "<S> they are satisfied to a good approximation in event - by - event hydrodynamics , and thus offer a direct test of hydrodynamic behavior , which does not rely on a specific model of initial conditions and medium properties . </S>",
    "<S> the recent measurement of @xmath16 by alice passes the test . </S>",
    "<S> we have made predictions for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 which can be measured in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> these new observables will allow to test hydrodynamic behavior directly , provided that one also measures higher - order correlations between @xmath17 and @xmath18 such as @xmath61 . </S>"
