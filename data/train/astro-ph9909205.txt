    "in the standard scenario of structure formation , a typical galaxy cluster draws its matter ( baryon + nonbaryon ) from a region of radius of @xmath20 mpc in the universe .",
    "therefore , it is widely believed that clusters should be fair samples of baryonic and nonbaryonic matter compositions , and thus their baryon fractions @xmath21 can be used to determine the average mass density of the universe , @xmath22 , in conjunction with the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( e.g. white et al .",
    "1993 ; david , jones & forman 1995 ) .",
    "however , all the x - ray measurements have so far shown an increase in the baryon fractions @xmath0 of clusters with radii and no any evidence for an asymptotic tendency towards a universal value at large radii ( white & fabian 1995 ; ettori , fabian & white 1997 ; david 1997 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ; for a recent summary see wu 1999a ) .",
    "the conflict between x - ray measurement and theoretical expectation becomes even more serious when the observed temperature profiles @xmath23 , which often exhibit a radial decline at large radii and can be well approximated by the polytropic models of @xmath24@xmath25 ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ) , instead of an isothermal gas distribution are used ( henriksen & mamon 1994 ; henriksen & white 1996 ; markevitch et al .",
    "in particular , it has been realized that the puzzle is unlikely to be associated with the conventional cluster mass estimates at least within the abell radius , which relies upon the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis for the dynamical state of clusters in the computation of their total masses .",
    "this point has been recently justified by the excellent agreement among the x - ray , optical and weak lensing determined cluster masses on scales @xmath26 mpc ( allen 1998 ; wu et al .",
    "1998 ) , where and also hereafter the hubble constant is taken to be @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "yet , we can not exclude the possibility that the regions accessible to current observations are still not large enough for the volume - averaged @xmath0 in clusters to be representative of the universe .",
    "meanwhile , it remains unclear how accurate the conventional cluster mass estimates will be on the outskirts of clusters where the infalling matter probably becomes important .",
    "a definite resolution to the puzzle may require detailed studies of these external regions .",
    "a good example of such studies has been provided in optical by geller , diaferio & kurtz ( 1999 ) for the coma cluster although their work yields no information about the baryonic mass of the cluster .    in this paper",
    "we make no attempt at resolving the puzzle .",
    "instead , we first study the necessary conditions for @xmath2 if clusters are the well dynamically - relaxed systems and share a common value of baryon fraction @xmath21 at @xmath27 .",
    "we then explore the possibility of deriving the asymptotic value @xmath12 from a local measurement @xmath0 made primarily over the central region of a cluster .",
    "finally , we apply our method to a strong lensing cluster sample and demonstrate how a useful constraint can be set on the universal value @xmath21 .",
    "since the contribution of stellar mass @xmath28 to the baryon fraction of a cluster is typically 5 times smaller than that of gas mass @xmath29 ( e.g. white et al .",
    "1993 ; ettori et al .",
    "1997 ) , we will not include @xmath28 in the estimate of the cluster baryon fraction below .",
    "following the conventional treatment ( cowie , henriksen & mushotzky 1987 ; henriksen & mamon 1994 ) , we assume a @xmath3 model for intracluster gas characterized by the electron number density profile , @xmath30^{-\\delta}$ ] , and an equation of state , @xmath31^{\\gamma-1}$ ] , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding central values and @xmath34 .",
    "the total mass in gas within a sphere of radius @xmath1 is simply @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the hydrogen mass fraction in the primordial abundances of hydrogen and helium .",
    "if the x - ray emitting gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential of the cluster , then the total dynamical mass within @xmath1 ( or @xmath39 ) is @xmath40 in which @xmath41 denotes the mean molecular weight .",
    "the volume - averaged baryon fraction within @xmath39 is then @xmath42 in which @xmath43    we now examine the dependence of baryon fraction on cluster radius . in the central region where @xmath44 , @xmath45 at large radius where @xmath46 the baryon fraction varies asymptotically as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "this disagrees with the previous result given by henriksen & mamon ( 1994 ) who claimed @xmath49}$ ] at large radius , which results in @xmath50 if @xmath12 is asymptotically constant .",
    "it is likely that they have mistaken @xmath51 for the asymptotic expansion of @xmath52 , and oversimplified the integral @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , their analysis has neglected the asymptotic behavior of @xmath54 at large radius for @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , in the single @xmath3 model with @xmath55 or @xmath56 , @xmath12 appears to be divergent .",
    "for any other @xmath57 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , if we require @xmath12 to be constant , it is easy to show that the polytropic index @xmath59 should satisfy @xmath60 this sets a stringent limit to the value of @xmath59 @xmath61 namely , the necessary condition for the baryon fraction of a cluster asymptotically approaching a universal value at large radius is that the intracluster gas has a polytropic index @xmath8 .",
    "it appears that all the observed temperature profiles of clusters so far have indeed met this simple requirement ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) . furthermore , because in the great majority of cases the observed x - ray surface brightness profiles show @xmath6 , we will only focus on the situation of where @xmath62 , for which the relationship between the volume - averaged baryon fractions measured at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , according to eqs.(6)-(9 ) , is @xmath65 nevertheless , the necessary conditions eq.(9 ) will yield an unphysical value of @xmath66 if @xmath67 , or an unusual result of @xmath68 if @xmath69 .",
    "the former may be avoided because the observationally fitted @xmath3 parameters from the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters are usually larger than @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 . in the latter case ( @xmath9 ) , the temperature profile of a cluster",
    "is required to slightly increase with outward radius in order for @xmath12 to maintain constant .",
    "this last point is indeed beyond our natural expectations .",
    "whether or not such a requirement is consistent with the spectroscopic data will be addressed in the discussion section .",
    "it deserves to examine the issue as to how fast the baryon fraction @xmath72 approaches the universal value .",
    "a relevant question is : to what radius can we take the volume - averaged baryon fraction @xmath72 as a good approximation of the universal value ?",
    "we display in fig.1 the variation of @xmath72 with radius for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , along with our asymptotic approximations from eq.(11 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the disagreement between the exact and asymptotic baryon fractions breaks down at rather larger radii , especially for clusters with large @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that one can ` directly ' measure the cosmic baryon fraction within a cluster of @xmath76 ( or @xmath10 ) , which needs the detection of x - ray emission out to a radius of @xmath77 , corresponding to @xmath78 mpc for an average x - ray core radius of @xmath79 mpc .",
    "this even does not account for the fact that hydrostatic equilibrium fails in this external region .",
    "indeed , the problem becomes much more serious for larger @xmath3 clusters because the observationally fitted @xmath3 parameter is strongly correlated with @xmath80 , with a large value of @xmath3 giving rise to a large @xmath80 value .",
    "moreover , it is apparent from fig.1 that @xmath72 increases monotonically with radius within the region accessible to current observations ( @xmath81 ) , which may provide a reasonable explanation for the present status of x - ray measurements of cluster baryon fractions mentioned at the very onset .",
    "we note , however , that it should be possible to estimate the universal baryon fraction from the small @xmath3 clusters .",
    "for example , in a @xmath82 cluster the deviations of the baryon fractions measured within @xmath83 and @xmath84 from the asymptotic value are only @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "it will be expected that a consistent baryon fraction can be obtained and applied to the determination of the cosmic density parameter @xmath22 when an ensemble of small @xmath3 clusters are used .",
    "next we compute the projected cluster baryon fraction @xmath87 within radius @xmath88 along the line of sight , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the projected gas and gravitating mass of the cluster within @xmath88 , respectively . under the same working hypothesis as in the above discussion , we have @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94\\frac{2y^2}{1+y^2}\\right ]               \\frac{y(y-\\sqrt{y^2-x^2})}{(1+y^2)^{1+\\delta(\\gamma-1 ) } } dy , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 .",
    "the projected baryon fraction within @xmath39 is then @xmath96 as @xmath39 approaches @xmath97 , we have @xmath98\\frac{2y^2}{1+y^2}\\ }               \\frac{dy}{(1+y^2)^{1+\\delta(\\gamma-1 ) } } } .\\ ] ] in particular , if we take the condition , @xmath99 , found in the above subsection for @xmath100 in order for @xmath12 to become a universal value , it can be shown that the above expression in the case of @xmath101 ( i.e. @xmath102 ) reduces to @xmath103 as a result , in the limits of @xmath104 and @xmath8 , we find according to eqs.(6 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 16 ) @xmath105",
    "in this section we demonstrate how to constrain the asymptotic baryon fraction of a cluster at large radius using the x - ray measurement made within a limiting detection radius . for this purpose , we select clusters from the strong lensing cluster sample compiled by wu et al ( 1998 ) , which contains 48 arclike images of background galaxies gravitationally lensed by 38 foreground clusters . here",
    "we exclude the clusters ( 1)whose x - ray temperatures are unknown or given by indirect methods such as the @xmath106-@xmath107 and @xmath108-@xmath107 correlations , where @xmath106 is the x - ray luminosity and @xmath108 is the velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies , or ( 2)whose x - ray surface brightness profiles are not well fitted by the @xmath3 models due to either the poor data quality ( e.g. cl2244 , etc . ) or other mechanisms intrinsic to clusters .",
    "nevertheless , we have included the well - known arc - cluster a370 but assumed a core radius @xmath109 mpc and @xmath110 although its x - ray surface brightness is not well constrained ( e.g. ota , mitsuda & fukazawa 1998 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "this results in a sample of 19 clusters , in which there are 25 strongly distorted images of distant galaxies ( table 1 ) .",
    "the projected cluster mass interior to the position ( @xmath111 ) of an arclike image can be simply estimated through @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the critical surface mass density , with @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 being the angular diameter distances to the cluster , to the background galaxy , and from the cluster to the galaxy , respectively .",
    "spectroscopic data have not been available for about half of the arcs , for which we assume a redshift of @xmath117 .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath118 due to the unknown redshifts of arcs are very minor .",
    "while the strong lensing can indeed yield the projected gravitating mass of a cluster independently of cluster matter contents and their dynamical state , eq.(18 ) may lead to an overestimate of the true cluster mass by a factor of @xmath119@xmath120 because it does not take the contribution of substructures into account .",
    "the factor of @xmath119@xmath120 comes from a statistical comparison of cluster masses determined from various methods including strong lensing , weak lensing , x - ray , optical and numerical simulations ( allen 1998 ; wu et al . 1998 ; wu 1999b ) .",
    "consequently , the ratio of the projected mass in gas @xmath121 to the strong lensing derived mass @xmath122 provides a low limit to the true baryon fraction @xmath123 within @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , since all the arclike images are detected within the central regions of the clusters , we can use @xmath124 to approximately represent the projected baryon fractions at cluster centers , @xmath125 .",
    "that is , @xmath126 the resultant values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 and their ratios within the positions of 25 arcs have been given in table 1 for a flat cosmological model @xmath127 .",
    "0.2truein    0.2truein    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,^,<,<,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +    on the other hand , we can also calculate the volume - averaged baryon fraction around @xmath63 for each lensing cluster using eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) , along with the restriction @xmath99 .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature profiles have not been obtained for these lensing clusters .",
    "instead , present x - ray observations have only provided the global emission weighted - temperatures @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the cooling function .",
    "when @xmath130 is used to calculate @xmath131 , we will either overestimate ( for @xmath10 ) or underestimate ( for @xmath132 ) the values of @xmath131 because @xmath130 are smaller ( greater ) than the central values @xmath33 in polytropic models with @xmath10 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "we have attempted to assign the upper and low limits to the central baryon fractions , respectively , for the 6 and 13 clusters with @xmath10 and @xmath132 in table 1 according to @xmath133 however , it appears that we can not make a clear distinction between the resultant upper and low limits among the 19 clusters ( see also fig.2 ) .",
    "this probably implies that the evaluation of @xmath134 is little affected by the approximation of the emission weighted temperature to the central temperature .    the low limits @xmath135 [ eq.(19 ) ] and the central baryon fractions @xmath134 approximated by eq.(21 ) can be converted into the total baryon fractions of clusters @xmath12 in terms of the relations established in the above section [ eqs.(11 ) and ( 17 ) ] , namely , @xmath136 where @xmath137 in fig.2 we plot the results of @xmath138 and @xmath139 obtained from the 25 arclike images among 19 lensing clusters listed in table 1 .",
    "note that @xmath139 is independent of arc position @xmath111 , and here we utilize @xmath111 to represent the lensing cluster only .",
    "it is apparent that the lensing and x - ray results are clearly separated except for three clusters , cl0500 , ms1358 and rxj1347 .",
    "dispersion in @xmath138 is relatively small , and averaging over the 25 data points yields @xmath140 where the error bar has not accounted for the uncertainties of @xmath3 and @xmath80 arising from the @xmath3 model fitting .",
    "the average value @xmath141 increases only slightly if the cooling flow clusters alone are considered : @xmath142 the reason why we emphasize this result is that an excellent agreement between cluster masses determined from strong lensing and x - ray measurements for cooling flow clusters has been claimed by allen ( 1998 ) .",
    "if this is true , we would expect @xmath143 .",
    "nevertheless , we will still adopt eq.(25 ) for caution s sake : first , the recent study of lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the cluster mass estimates using the cnoc cluster sample does not reveal the large discrepancy between cooling and non - cooling flow clusters ; second , the values of @xmath138 we have found for cooling and non - cooling flow clusters are essentially consistent with each other ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "a glimpse of fig.2 reveals that the three clusters ( cl0500 , ms1358 and rxj1347 ) which give smaller values of @xmath139 all have their @xmath3 values less than @xmath144 .",
    "this motivates us to examine the dependence of @xmath139 upon @xmath3 for our cluster sample ( fig.3 ) .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath139 derived from the volume - averaged baryon fractions among clusters with @xmath10 are systematically high . as has been pointed out in section 2.1 , these asymptotic values can not be used as a reliable indicator of the universal baryon fraction because the agreement between the exact and asymptotic values of the baryon fractions occurs at rather large radii @xmath77 where the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis may have already broken down . on the other hand ,",
    "there are good reasons that the asymptotic values @xmath139 obtained among cl0500 , ms1358 and rxj1347 can be considered as a good approximation of the universal baryon fraction : first , the @xmath3 parameters for these three clusters are smaller than @xmath144 , which guarantees the condition @xmath145 within @xmath146 ; second , all these three clusters are classified as the cooling flow clusters , for which the total cluster masses @xmath147 could be determined relatively accurately from eq.(3 ) ( allen 1998 ) ; third , the asymptotic values @xmath139 from the volume - averaged baryon fractions among these three clusters are essentially consistent with the asymptotic values @xmath138 , and @xmath148    as a conservative estimate , we utilize the average values @xmath141 and @xmath149 among all the clusters to be the low and upper limits to the universal baryon fraction @xmath150 which , in combination with the bbn prediction ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) , corresponds to the following constraints on the cosmological density parameter @xmath151 where the uncertainty of the bbn prediction , @xmath152 , has been included , and @xmath153 is the average baryon mass density of the universe in units of the critical density for closure . if the average value @xmath149 in the three cooling clusters with @xmath17 is adopted , we have @xmath154    finally , we investigate whether the asymptotic baryon fractions ( or limits ) @xmath138 and @xmath139 derived from the strong lensing clusters depend on x - ray temperature .",
    "this is important because variation of baryon fractions among clusters of different temperatures is not allowed in the standard models of structure formation .",
    "for the time being we can only take a less serious approach to the problem in the sense that the exact baryon fractions of these lensing clusters have remained unknown .",
    "fig.4 illustrates the dependence of @xmath138 and @xmath139 upon the emission - weighted temperature for the 19 clusters in table 1 .",
    "the best - fitted @xmath155 and @xmath156 relations are , respectively , @xmath157 where @xmath130 is in units of kev",
    ". these relations are marginally consistent with no increase of baryon fractions with @xmath130 as predicted in the standard models although they can not be used as a direct evidence .",
    "similar result has recently been reported by mohr , mathiesen & evrard ( 1999 ) .",
    "the baryon fraction @xmath0 of a cluster should be averaged over a sufficiently large cluster volume in order for @xmath0 to be representative of the universal value @xmath21 . however ,",
    "this is limited by the sensitivity of current detectors which can only probe a finite region of the x - ray cluster .",
    "we have thus studied the condition for @xmath158 and also the possibility of deriving @xmath12 from the central baryon fraction @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "it has been shown that the polytropic index of intracluster gas should satisfy @xmath159 if the baryon fraction of a cluster is required to asymptotically reach a universal value @xmath21 at large radius .",
    "it appears that all the clusters whose temperature profiles have been available thus far indeed meet this simple requirement .",
    "we have found that clusters with small @xmath3 parameters are likely to provide a better estimate of the universal baryon fraction , which arises because the exact and asymptotic forms of the baryon fractions merge at rather large radii @xmath77 for @xmath160 , where hydrostatic equilibrium becomes to be questionable .",
    "we have also demonstrated how to set useful constraints on the baryon fraction @xmath21 , and thereby the average mass density of the universe , @xmath22 , using a sample of 19 strong lensing clusters .",
    "our analysis gives support to a medium density universe , and the scatters in the present estimate of @xmath22 can be greatly reduced when a large cluster sample is employed .",
    "however , there are several factors which should be taken seriously .",
    "our major concern is the current working model for clusters , in which the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis and the conventional @xmath3 model for intracluster gas are extrapolated to sufficiently large radii .",
    "the availability of this working model to the abell radius has been demonstrated by the reasonable agreement between different mass estimators . in principle , clusters can approximately be regarded as dynamically - relaxed systems out to the falling shock radii where cluster matter is mixed with the infalling matter from background universe .",
    "presumably , our conclusion can not be applied beyond these radii , within which the volume - averaged matter composition should be of cosmological significance .",
    "even so , since these boundaries are well beyond the regions accessible to present observations , it is unclear whether the intracluster gas in the outmost regions still follows the @xmath3 and polytropic models .    to ensure the universal constancy of the cluster baryon fraction at large radius ,",
    "the intracluster gas should have a polytropic index of @xmath68 if the fitted @xmath3 parameter to the x - ray surface brightness of the cluster is in the range of from @xmath70 to @xmath161 .",
    "this requires an increasing temperature with cluster radius , in conflict with the naive speculation that the overall temperature profile of a cluster should drop with radius .",
    "the latter occurs , according to our prediction , only inside cluster with @xmath162 . at present",
    ", the spectroscopic analyses have resulted in a discrepancy in the radial temperature gradients due primarily to the problem with the sensitivities and resolutions of detectors .",
    "for instance , by contrast to the remarkably radial temperature decline claimed by markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the nearly flat temperature profiles have recently been reported by irwin , bregman & evrard ( 1999 ) based on a detailed comparison of the asca and rosat pspc determined temperature profiles of 26 clusters . in particular , the trend of an increasing temperature with radius is likely to present in a few cases ( e.g. 2a0335 , a401 , a1651 , a3571 , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , it is not impossible that the temperature profiles would have a mild increase with radii for clusters with @xmath9 . a conclusive test for this claim will be provided by the space experiments like axaf and xmm .",
    "another concern is the poorly determined @xmath3 and @xmath80 parameters used in the computations of the baryon fraction limits @xmath138 and @xmath139 , because @xmath12 depends sensitively on these two parameters . to date , the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters have not been well measured at large radii ( @xmath163 mpc ) .",
    "therefore , there may exist rather large uncertainties in the present fitting of @xmath3 models , apart from the fact that different observations at different energy bands might give very different values of @xmath3 and @xmath80 even for the same cluster .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3 model fitting is affected by the procedure of whether or not the cooling flow regions are reasonably excluded .",
    "for instance , from a detailed study of the surface brightness distributions of 25 cooling flow clusters , vikhlinin , forman & jones ( 1999 ) have shown that the @xmath3 values are systematically higher outside the cooling flow regions .",
    "alternatively , a double @xmath3 model has been often used in recent years to represent quantitatively the excess emission in the central cores of cooling flow clusters ( e.g. ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ; xu et al . 1998 ; mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ) , which also results in a larger value of @xmath3 for the extended gas component .",
    "so , it is possible to release the requirement that x - ray temperature should increase with radius in order for @xmath12 to remain constant if large @xmath3 parameter is adopted .",
    "furthermore , because our attempt to derive the universal value @xmath12 from the central baryon fractions @xmath134 depends sensitively on the central gas distributions , our current results are subject to the presence of the sharp peaks in emission concentrated in the cores of some clusters .    nevertheless , if clusters are representative of the universe , and if the entire intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential of clusters and follows the @xmath3 model , we would expect that the x - ray surface brightness and temperature profiles of clusters should satisfy the necessary condition eq.(9 ) , which reads @xmath4 for @xmath104",
    ". this will be directly testable when these two profiles are well measured ( e.g. by axaf , xmm , etc . ) .",
    "even if the temperature profile of a cluster is not available , we will still be able to obtain its baryon fraction according to eq.(11 ) or ( 17 ) by accurately measuring its x - ray surface brightness distribution and its central temperature @xmath33 , especially for a cluster with smaller @xmath3 parameter .",
    "applications to existing data and future observations will be made in our subsequent work .",

    "<S> while x - ray measurements have so far revealed an increase in the volume - averaged baryon fractions @xmath0 of galaxy clusters with cluster radii @xmath1 , @xmath0 should asymptotically reach a universal value @xmath2 , provided that clusters are representative of the universe . in the framework of hydrostatic equilibrium for intracluster gas , we have derived the necessary conditions for @xmath2 : the x - ray surface brightness profile described by the @xmath3 model and the temperature profile approximated by the polytropic model should satisfy @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , which sets a stringent limit to the polytropic index : @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a mildly increasing temperature with radius is required if the observationally fitted @xmath3 parameter is in the range @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that a reliable determination of the universal baryon fraction can be achieved in the small @xmath3 clusters because the disagreement between the exact and asymptotic baryon fractions for clusters with @xmath10 breaks down at rather large radii ( @xmath11 ) where hydrostatic equilibrium has probably become inapplicable . </S>",
    "<S> we further explore how to obtain the asymptotic value @xmath12 of baryon fraction from the x - ray measurement made primarily over the finite central region of a cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate our method using a sample of 19 strong lensing clusters , which enables us to place a useful constraint on @xmath12 : @xmath13 , corresponding to a cosmological density parameter @xmath14 for @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 . </S>",
