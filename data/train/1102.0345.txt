    "simons and altshuler calculated the universal two - point level correlation function for a disordered system under the influence of an external perturbation for instance in the form of an aharonov - bohm flux and showed that the response of the spectrum to those parameter variations was universal after a suitable scaling with two system specific parameters .",

    "the formula becomes @xmath210 with the normalization @xmath211 for the group velocity distribution .",
    "the result for the number of propagating modes also applies for these classical waves .",
    "+ to conclude , we have studied the agreement between numerical computations and a semiclassical approximation of the number of propagating modes in a diffusive periodic waveguide .",
    "we also showed the relation between @xmath12 and previously studied spectral properties of periodic systems .",
    "the semiclassical results used in our analysis is previous to the discovery of how to include non - diagonal contributions to correlation functions .",
    "nevertheless it was noted @xcite that their role in the computation of the fluctuations in velocity should be very limited .",
    "indeed , besides the average justified by the rapid phases variation , the observable amplitude ( the velocity in this case ) fluctuates around its null average , further justifying the diagonal approximation .",
