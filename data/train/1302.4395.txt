    "quarkonia of heavy quark - antiquark bound states are promising probes for the qgp created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "many studies have been carried out in recent years .",
    "these include experimental measurements of its yield in heavy ion collisions at both the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , as well as theoretical studies based on various models  @xcite .",
    "these studies have indicated that a quantitative description of quarkonium production in these collisions requires the understanding of its interactions in both the produced qgp and the initial cold nuclear matter .",
    "one of the important qgp effects is the dissociation of quarkonium by thermal patrons  @xcite .",
    "the resulting thermal dissociation width of a quarkonium is determined by its dissociation cross section and the density of partons . in both the leading order  @xcite and the next - to - leading order calculations",
    "@xcite in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , the quarkonium dissociation cross section is characterized by its dipole nature through the derivative of the quarkonium wave function with respect to the relative momentum between the heavy quark and antiquark . however , the thermal dissociation of quarkonium in qgp is relevant only after the quarkonium is completely formed from the heavy quark - antiquark pair that are produced from initial hard scatterings between colliding nucleons .",
    "while the heavy quark pair are produced during the time of @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the heavy quark mass , a quarkonium takes a longer time to be formed from the pair .",
    "this is because the typical time scale needed to separate the bound state from the continuum or the excited states are related to the inverse of their energy differences , which in the heavy quark limit of qcd scales as the bound state energy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the qcd coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to determine the formation time of quarkonium  @xcite .",
    "one of them is based on the space - time correlator of the heavy quark current operator  @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that all parameters involved in the calculation can be related to experimentally measured quantities in heavy quark production from electron - positron annihilation , @xmath4 . in the present study",
    ", we extend this method to study the quarkonium formation time in qgp by using the quarkonium in - medium mass and wave function that are determined by taking the heavy quark potential to be either the free energy or the internal energy of a heavy quark pair in qgp as extracted from lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formulas ] , we briefly review the quarkonium formation time in the approach based on the space - time correlator of the heavy quark vector current .",
    "we then describe in sec .",
    "[ results ] the quarkonium formation time in qgp by using the quarkonium in - medium mass and wave function calculated from the lattice heavy quark potentials . finally a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "for the heavy quark vector current operator @xmath5 , its space - time correlator @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 using the dispersion relation @xmath8 to relate the real part of the heavy quark correlator in energy - momentum space or pair polarization function @xmath9 to its imaginary part , one can rewrite , for @xmath10 , eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the relativistic causal propagator in the coordinate space with @xmath13 being the modified bessel function and @xmath14 being the euclidean proper time  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the heavy quark pair polarization function is related to the ratio of the cross section for heavy quark pair production to that for dimuon production in electron - positron annihilation , @xmath15 the cross section ratio @xmath16 in the above equation can be parameterized by the sum of resonances and a continuum  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the spin , mass , dielectron and total decay widths of resonance @xmath22 , respectively ; @xmath23 is the electric charge of the heavy quark and the threshold energy @xmath24 is taken to be twice the mass of open heavy flavor .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( [ imaginary ] ) and ( [ r - ratio ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ correlator2 ] ) , one obtains following contributions to the heavy quark space - time correlator from resonances and the continuum  @xcite : @xmath25 these expressions show that the contribution from the continuum dominates at earlier times and is then gradually taken over by that from resonances .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that the @xmath26 pair produced in @xmath27 annihilation is initially formed in a continuum state and then evolves into a quarkonium state .    by taking the ratio of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the heavy quark space - time correlator due to resonance @xmath22 and @xmath30 is the total heavy quark pair polarization function excluding contributions from quarkonium resonances with masses lower than the mass of quarkonian @xmath22 , one can then obtain the distribution of the formation time of quarkonium @xmath22 according to  @xcite @xmath31",
    "although the quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath24 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) are well known if one is interested in determining the formation time of a quarkonium in free space , their values in hot dense medium depends on theoretical models . in the present study",
    ", we determine them using the heavy quark potential taken from the potential energy between a heavy quark - antiquark pair that is extracted from lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "while the heavy quark potential based on their free energy is directly extracted from lattice calculations , that based on their internal energy depends also on the entropy density . as a result , the internal energy potential is stronger than the free energy potential . at present , it is still an open question as to which potential energy should be used in determining the properties of a quarkonium in qgp .",
    "we therefore use both potential energies for the present study and compare the resulting predictions .      from its wave function at the origin",
    ", the dielectron decay width of quarkonium @xmath22 can be calculated according to  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fine structure constant .",
    "( 1s ) and @xmath43 ( 2s ) for the case of free energy potential at @xmath44 and at @xmath45 , respectively.,width=9 ]    as an example , we consider the formation time of bottomonia in qgp .",
    "their in - medium masses and wave functions are obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger2 ] ) with the bottom quark mass of @xmath46 4.65 gev .",
    "figure  [ wavefts ] shows their wave functions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the free energy potential at several temperatures .",
    "it is seen that as temperature increases , the wave function of quarkonium becomes broader . as a result ,",
    "the probability for the heavy quark and antiquark in the quarkonium to annihilate and decay into dielectron becomes smaller .",
    "we note that the binding energies of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are larger and their wave functions also have larger values at the origin if the more attractive heavy quark potential based on the internal energy is used .",
    "( 1s ) formation time for the case of free energy potential at @xmath49 , and @xmath50.,width=9 ]    taking the threshold energy for the continuum contribution in eq.([pi ] ) to be @xmath51 , we have calculated the distribution of the @xmath43 ( 1s ) formation time at several temperatures for the case of free energy potential , and they are shown in fig .  [ distributions ] .",
    "the distribution peaks at small @xmath14 at @xmath52 but spreads to later times at high temperature .",
    "there are two reasons for this behavior of the @xmath43 formation time in qgp .",
    "first , the smaller @xmath20 at high temperature delays the time for the contribution of quarkonium to the heavy quark correlator @xmath53 to become dominant .",
    "secondly , the small binding energy of quarkonium at high temperature makes its formation to take longer time . in the large euclidean time",
    "@xmath14 limit , the contributions to the heavy quark correlator from a resonance @xmath22 and the continuum are proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively  @xcite . because the resonance mass @xmath19 is always smaller than the threshold for the continuum , the contribution from a resonance eventually becomes dominant .",
    "however , if the binding energy of quarkonium is very small , it takes a long time for the contribution of the quarkonium state to become much more important than that of the continuum states .",
    ", @xmath48 , and @xmath56 as functions of temperature for the cases of free energy ( upper ) and internal energy ( lower ) potentials.,width=9 ]    figure  [ formations ] shows the average formation times of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath56 as functions of temperature , @xmath57 for the two cases of free energy and internal energy potentials .",
    "it is seen that the average formation time of quarkonium increases with temperature and diverges near its dissociation temperature .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of the quarkonium radius in qgp  @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable because as the quarkonium radius increases at high temperature , it takes longer for the quarkonium to be formed  @xcite .",
    "since the quarkonium is less bound and has a larger radius in the case of the free energy potential than that of the internal energy potential , the formation time is thus longer in the former than in the latter case .",
    "compared to the formation time of 0.32 fm/@xmath58 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a @xmath47 in free space , our values of 0.44 fm/@xmath58 and 0.3 fm/@xmath58 at @xmath59 for the cases of free energy and internal energy potentials are slightly larger and similar , respectively .",
    "( 1s ) to its formation time as a function of temperature for the cases of free energy ( solid line ) and internal energy ( dashed line ) potentials .",
    "solid squares are the temperature dependence of the qcd coupling constant ( scaled by 1.1 ) at the screening distance between heavy quark and antiquark pair extracted from the lattice free energy.,width=9 ]    in fig .",
    "[ velocities ] , we show the ratio of the mean distance between bottom quark and antibottom quark in @xmath43 ( 1s ) to its formation time as a function of temperature , calculated according to @xmath60 .",
    "it can be interpreted as the average relative velocity between bottom and antibottom quarks before they form the @xmath43 ( 1s ) state .",
    "results in fig .",
    "[ velocities ] show that the relative velocity is smaller for the case of free energy potential than for that of internal energy potential , and that it decreases as temperature increases .",
    "the latter is consistent with the fact that the wave function of bottomonium in momentum space has a small relative momentum at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that only bottom quark pairs with small relative momentum contribute to bottomonium formation at high temperature , because even if a heavy quark pair initially have a large relative momentum , they can lose energy during propagation through qgp  @xcite and thus become slowly moving relative to each other .",
    "it is useful to discuss the result shown in fig .",
    "[ velocities ] using the relevant scales for the heavy quark system in qcd .",
    "the heavy quark system is characterized by three scales ; hard @xmath1 , soft @xmath61 and ultra - soft @xmath62 in terms of the heavy quark mass and velocity .",
    "the different scales are the basis for the potential non - relativistic qcd ( pnrqcd ) approach , which is an effective field theory for heavy quarks with bound states  @xcite . in the @xmath63 limit",
    ", one notes that the soft and ultra - soft scales are proportional to the inverse bohr radius @xmath64 and the binding energy of the system , which scale with the qcd coupling as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the heavy quark pair mean distance to the quarkonium formation time ratio shown in fig .  [ velocities ] should be proportional to @xmath67 or @xmath68 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath69 was extracted from the lattice free energy by estimating the nonperturbative coupling constant at the screening distance between the quark and antiquark pair , which should be the most relevant distance for the heavy bound state .",
    "it is quite interesting to see that the temperature dependence of @xmath69 , scaled by an overall factor of 1.1 , is close to the ratio in fig .",
    "[ velocities ] extracted from the free energy potential .",
    "we have studied the quarkonium formation time in qgp by using the approach based on the space - time correlator of heavy quark vector currents .",
    "the imaginary part of the resulting heavy quark pair polarization function , which is the spectral function of heavy quark pair in @xmath70 annihilation , is constructed by solving the schrdinger equation with the heavy quark potential extracted from lattice calculations .",
    "the real part of the polarization function , which is related to its imaginary part by the dispersion relation , then provides the information on how different states of the heavy quark pair evolve with time .    using bottomonia as examples",
    ", we have found that the average formation time of a quarkonium from a heavy quark - antiquark pair increases with temperature and diverges near the dissociation temperature of the quarkonium .",
    "furthermore , the quarkonium formation time is longer if the heavy quark potential is taken to be their free energy instead of their internal energy from the lattice calculations .",
    "we have also found that the average relative velocity between the heavy quark pair before they form the quarkonium , calculated via the ratio of the mean distance between the heavy quark and antiquark in a quarkonium to its formation time , decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "our results thus indicate that because of the longer formation time of quarkonium at high temperature , to fully describe quarkonium production in relativistic heavy ion collisions requires a proper treatment of the medium effects on heavy quark pairs in the qgp before they form the quarkonium bound state .",
