    "these stars formed early in galactic history when only a small number of massive stars had evolved to become type ii supernovae and added heavy elements to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "observations ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) show that there is a lack of correlation between the `` metallicity '' measured by [ fe / h ] and abundances of @xmath0-elements above @xmath3 ( e.g. , ba and eu ) for stars with @xmath4}\\lesssim -2.5 $ ] .",
    "this disagrees with the view that fe and @xmath0-elements are always coproduced by supernovae .",
    "our approach to account for this result is based on a two - component @xmath0-process model ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ; qian , vogel , & wasserburg 1998 ; qian & wasserburg 1999 , hereafter qw99 ) which attributes heavy @xmath0-nuclei to high frequency supernovae ( h events ) and light @xmath0-nuclei to less frequent ones ( l events ) .",
    "we propose that prompt production of fe with minor coproduction of heavy @xmath0-elements in the earliest era of the galaxy first enriched the ism up to [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 .",
    "subsequent production of @xmath1 nuclei with negligible coproduction of fe by h events then resulted in a wide range of abundances for heavy @xmath0-elements at @xmath4}\\lesssim -2.5 $ ] .",
    "we associate further fe enrichment of the ism for [ fe / h ]  @xmath6 with l events .",
    "addition of h and l events over a sufficiently long timescale then led to a correlation between [ fe / h ] and abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements at [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 .",
    "mathews , bazan , & cowan ( 1992 ) discussed using galactic chemical evolution to constrain the site of the @xmath0-process . a number of recent studies ( ishimaru & wanajo 1999 ; tsujimoto , shigeyama , & yoshii 1999 ; mcwilliam & searle 1999 ; see also raiteri et al .",
    "1999 ) focused on the relationships between [ fe / h ] and abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements in the early galaxy .",
    "a common consensus is that chemical enrichment of the ism at very early times was grossly inhomogeneous and diverse yields of individual supernova events had dramatic effects on abundances in very metal - poor stars .",
    "our present work differs from previous studies in that the diversity in @xmath0-process production by supernovae is introduced through the two - component @xmath0-process model based on solar system data independent of the stellar observations .",
    "further , we propose a prompt mechanism for fe production considering special conditions of the early galaxy . in  2 we describe the framework of two @xmath0-process components . in ",
    "3 we use this together with a postulated prompt fe source to explain the observational results on abundances ( especially for ba and eu ) in the early galaxy .",

    "( 1996 , 1998 ) demonstrated that abundances of @xmath0-elements in the pt peak ( @xmath8 ) and down to ba ( @xmath3 ) in cs  22892052 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 ) , hd  115444 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 ) , and hd  126238 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath11 ) are in remarkable accord with the solar system @xmath0-process abundance pattern ( the solar @xmath0-pattern ) . assuming that a single @xmath0-pattern extends from ba to the actinides above the pt peak , cowan et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) discussed using the th / eu ratio as a galactic chronometer .",
    "however , the discovery of @xmath12hf ( lifetime @xmath13  yr ) in meteorites with ( @xmath12hf/@xmath14hf)@xmath15 ( harper & jacobsen 1996 ; lee & halliday 1995 , 1997 ) at the time of solar system formation ( ssf ) provided a new twist to our understanding of the @xmath0-process . although both @xmath12hf and @xmath16i ( @xmath17  yr ) are produced essentially only by the @xmath0-process , the @xmath12hf data and abundance ratio ( @xmath16i/@xmath18i)@xmath19 ( reynolds 1960 ; see also brazzle et al .",
    "1999 ) can not be explained by a single type of @xmath0-process events .",
    "based on this , wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded that there had to be at least two distinct types of @xmath0-process events : one ( h ) occurring on a timescale @xmath20  yr , commensurate with that for replenishment of a typical molecular cloud with fresh supernova debris , and the other ( l ) occurring on a much longer timescale @xmath21  yr . they further pointed out that relative to the solar @xmath0-pattern , there should be frequent abundance excesses of @xmath0-elements in the pt peak over those in the @xmath22 peak below ba at low metallicities .",
    "qian et al . (",
    "1998 ) showed that in a two - component model to account for the solar @xmath0-pattern , the total mass yield of an l event must be @xmath23 times that of an h event .",
    "they also showed that it is not readily possible to produce the @xmath22 peak without substantially populating the region beyond this peak .",
    "they further speculated that h events might be associated with production of black holes and l events with production of neutron stars .    a preliminary report on the observed ag ( @xmath24 ) abundance in cs 22892052 by cowan & sneden ( 1999 ) appeared to support the meteoritic prediction that more than one type of @xmath0-process events may be required . based on this , qian & wasserburg ( qw99 ) sought to establish a quantitative basis for predicting the yields of @xmath0-elements in h and l events .",
    "their model uses the following assumptions : ( 1 ) each h or l event has fixed @xmath0-process yields ; ( 2 ) the products of individual h and l events are mixed with a `` standard '' mass of hydrogen in the ism ; and ( 3 ) the solar system inventory of all @xmath0-nuclei ( both stable and radioactive ) are the result of production by h and l events over a time @xmath25  yr preceding ssf .",
    "the timescales for occurrence of h and l events in a volume corresponding to the standard mixing mass of hydrogen are @xmath26 and @xmath27 . under the above assumptions , at the time of ssf , the number of nuclei for a stable nuclide @xmath28 ( e.g. , @xmath18i or @xmath12w ) mixed with a standard mass of hydrogen is @xmath29 while that for a radioactive nuclide @xmath30 with @xmath31 ( e.g. , @xmath16i or @xmath12hf ) is @xmath32 in equations ( [ ns ] ) and ( [ nr ] ) @xmath33 or @xmath34 denotes the yield in an h or l event .",
    "the yield for a radioactive species is taken to be about the same as that for the corresponding stable nuclide . in equation ( [ nr ] ) the interval between ssf and the last l event is assumed to be @xmath27 , while that between ssf and the last h event is specified by @xmath35 @xmath36 . from the meteoritic data on @xmath16i and @xmath12hf ,",
    "it was found that @xmath37  yr and @xmath38  yr for @xmath39 ( scenario a ) .",
    "further , the yields for @xmath18i and @xmath12w in an l event relative to those in an h event , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are rather strongly constrained for all cases bracketed by scenarios a and b ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "given @xmath35 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , the yields for @xmath18i and @xmath12w in an h or l event can be obtained from the relevant solar system data through equations ( [ ns ] ) and ( [ nr ] ) .    to generalize the results to other @xmath0-nuclei ,",
    "qian & wasserburg ( qw99 ) assumed that the yield template for @xmath1 nuclei associated with @xmath12w is the same as the corresponding solar @xmath0-pattern for both h and l events based on the observations by sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the yields for @xmath2 nuclei associated with @xmath18i in an h or l event were also chosen to follow the corresponding solar @xmath0-pattern .",
    "consequently , the yield for a stable nucleus @xmath28 with mass number @xmath43 in an l event relative to that in an h event is @xmath44 for @xmath2 or @xmath45 for @xmath1 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath46 nuclei contributed by h or l events to the corresponding solar @xmath0-process abundance are @xmath47 $ ] or @xmath48 . from equation ( [ ns ] )",
    "the abundance of stable @xmath28 nuclei resulting from a single h or l event contaminating a standard mass of hydrogen in the ism is @xmath49 or @xmath50 . here",
    "the spectroscopic notation @xmath51 is used ( @xmath52 being the number abundance ratio of @xmath28 to hydrogen ) .",
    "thus , given @xmath35 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , there is a quantitative prediction for the abundances resulting from a single @xmath0-process event .",
    "for example , a single h event gives rise to @xmath55 to @xmath56 and @xmath57 to @xmath58 over a wide range of model parameters .",
    "the results from a mixture of multiple events can be calculated simply by adding the number of nuclei produced in each event and then converting it to the corresponding @xmath59 value for the mixture ( see qw99 ) .",
    "observational data ( gratton & sneden 1994 ; mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ; sneden et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) on ba / eu , @xmath60 , and [ fe / h ] for low - metallicity stars are shown in figure 1 . as can be seen",
    ", there is a wide dispersion in @xmath60 at @xmath4}\\lesssim -2.5 $ ] while ba / eu is essentially constant .",
    "the @xmath0-process accounts for over 90% of the solar eu inventory but only about 20% of the solar ba inventory ( kppeler , beer , & wisshak 1989 ; arlandini et al .",
    "consequently , the clustering of ba / eu around the solar @xmath0-process value exhibited in figure 1 confirms the earlier proposal by truran ( 1981 ) that heavy elements such as ba in very metal - poor stars originated from the @xmath0-process .",
    "there are few eu data at @xmath61}\\lesssim -3 $ ] . however , sufficient ba data at these metallicities ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) are available and shown in figure 2 ( region a ) .",
    "both ba and eu data show a wide dispersion at @xmath4}\\lesssim -2.5 $ ] ( region b ) and suggest that fe and heavy @xmath0-nuclei are not coproduced by common supernovae ( h events ) .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath60 values from a single h event in our model ( qw99 ) are indicated by the zone marked `` 1 h '' in the corresponding figure .",
    "we expect that increases of @xmath62 and @xmath60 above this zone are dominantly the results of adding more h events to the standard mixing mass of hydrogen .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we take @xmath63 for hd 122563 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath64 ) as representative of a single h event , then the eu abundance in cs 22892052 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath65 ) would correspond to @xmath66 h events . as the fe abundance in cs 22892052 is smaller than that in hd 122563 , it is evident that fe can not be significantly produced by h events .",
    "thus the wide dispersion in ba and eu abundances at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 poses a conundrum of fe production in the early galaxy and suggests that [ fe / h ] is neither related to heavy @xmath0-element production nor a reliable chronometer ( see qw99 ) .",
    "we find that the fe conundrum can be resolved by postulating an initial or promptly - generated fe inventory that existed before the occurrence of h and l events . by `` initial '' we mean very early stages during which an inventory of fe was provided to the ism from which regular stars later formed with no other temporal connection .",
    "prompt fe production is considered to be associated with coevolution of all stars from an initial gas clot with no fe . in both cases",
    "the mechanism for fe production must have ceased at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 .",
    "then non - fe - producing h events and fe - producing l events ( see below ) began to occur .",
    "the frequent occurrence of h events would result in a range of abundances for heavy @xmath0-elements such as ba and eu at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 while the less frequent occurrence of l events would lead to increases in fe abundance above [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 . a correlation between [ fe / h ] and abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements",
    "would then be established when sufficient fe was produced by l events to overwhelm the inventory produced by the initial / prompt fe source which was not related to `` typical '' supernovae .",
    "the existence of some stars with @xmath61}\\lesssim -3 $ ] in region a of figure 2 indicates that the initial / prompt fe production had diverse yields and/or was sufficiently extended in time so that [ fe / h]@xmath5 represents the sum of a number of individual events .",
    "the ba abundances in region a could be attributed to production by the initial / prompt fe source which would be small compared with that by a single h event . however , these data could also be explained by a mixing scenario with no ba production by the initial / prompt fe source ( see  4 ) .",
    "the onset of the correlation between [ fe / h ] and abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements can be estimated as follows . by attributing @xmath67 of the solar fe inventory ( timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ) to the type ii supernovae associated with l events , we expect a single l event to result in @xmath68 corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath69",
    "if we take @xmath70  yr ( @xmath71 l events are then responsible for the part of the solar fe inventory contributed by type ii supernovae ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that a correlation between [ fe / h ] and abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements would be established through addition of h and l events over a few @xmath72 yr during which the ism was sufficiently enriched by l events to [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , data in figures 1 and 2 ( region c ) show that such a correlation exists at [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 .",
    "there is a basic issue of what plausible mechanism could account for the initial or promptly - generated fe inventory .",
    "the prompt fe production in a gas clot must have lasted for only a narrow time interval ( @xmath73  yr ) and then was greatly diminished .",
    "a possible mechanism would involve fe production by supermassive stars with no significant coproduction of heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "let us consider a pristine gas clot of mass @xmath74 from which two populations of stars could be made : supermassive stars with very short lifetimes ( @xmath75  yr ) and less massive stars with lifetimes longer than @xmath76  yr .",
    "so @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 represent the masses stored in supermassive ( `` fat '' ) stars , less massive ( `` petite '' ) stars , and gas at time @xmath81 .",
    "taking the birth rates of both types of stars to be proportional to @xmath80 and assuming that supermassive stars were born at about the same rate as they were destroyed , we have @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the average lifetime of supermassive stars , and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 and @xmath86 $ ] . therefore ,",
    "if the birth rate for less massive stars was sufficiently high to deplete the gas over a few @xmath87  yr , then the population of supermassive stars would decline on the same timescale .",
    "this would provide some diversity in fe abundances in stars formed at very early times but effectively truncate further addition of fe from supermassive stars .",
    "stars with masses @xmath88 are considered to become supernovae .",
    "their lifetimes range from @xmath89  yr to @xmath90  yr ( see fig",
    ". 1 of timmes et al .",
    "meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) gave a lifetime @xmath91  yr for a @xmath92 star .",
    "therefore , prompt fe production in our model must be associated with supermassive stars of at least a few @xmath93 .",
    "these stars are assumed to produce no significant amount of heavy @xmath0-nuclei but sufficient fe to give [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 over a few @xmath87  yr .",
    "as speculated above , the termination of prompt fe production was caused by rapid depletion of gas through storage in less massive stars over a few @xmath87  yr . thus the initial star formation rate in a pristine gas clot of mass @xmath94 is required to be @xmath95  yr@xmath96 . when extrapolated to the whole galaxy",
    ", this corresponds to an initial rate @xmath97  yr@xmath96 , much higher than the average value of @xmath98  yr@xmath96 over galactic history . on a longer timescale ,",
    "stars with @xmath88 became supernovae and began to enrich the ism .",
    "these supernovae are of two types : high frequency h events and low frequency l events . within a standard mass of hydrogen ,",
    "h and l events occur on timescales @xmath99  yr and @xmath100  yr , respectively . the h events produce heavy @xmath0-elements but no fe and this resulted in a wide range of abundances for heavy @xmath0-elements ( e.g. , ba and eu ) at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 .",
    "a correlation between [ fe / h ] and abundances of heavy @xmath0-elements was established later through addition of h and l events over a few @xmath72  yr when fe production by l events overwhelmed the prompt fe inventory .",
    "the observed onset of this correlation at [ fe / h ]  @xmath69 is consistent with the expected fe yield of l events .",
    "the l events also produce light @xmath0-elements such as ag .",
    "production of these elements by the hypothesized prompt fe source is unknown .",
    "it was argued that the first stars of h - he composition would be very massive ( e.g. , truran & cameron 1971 ) . these stars would provide elements heavier than he to the ism ( e.g. , ezer & cameron 1971 ) .",
    "how much fe would be produced by these stars and how this fe would be mixed with the ism require more investigation .",
    "it is likely that supermassive stars would blow up their parent gas clots , thus preventing further star formation . in this case",
    "they would provide fe to the general ism .",
    "we speculate that once [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 was reached , supermassive stars could no longer be produced and less massive stars would form instead . in this scenario an initial fe inventory could be provided without requiring a high star formation rate in the gas clots before the h and l events occurred .",
    "we note that the cut - off at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 may correspond to a condition when sufficient amount of elements heavier than he was provided by supermassive stars to permit adequate cooling of aggregating matter for less massive ( @xmath101 ) stars to form .",
    "a supermassive star of a few @xmath102 must produce a few @xmath103 of fe in order to give [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 to a clot of @xmath94 .",
    "region a of figure 2 deserves special attention .",
    "we are faced with ba abundances below the production by a single h event at @xmath104\\lesssim -3 $ ] .",
    "these ba abundances could be attributed to minor heavy @xmath0-element production by supermassive stars .",
    "however , supernova explosions could drive gas outflows from a clot .",
    "the enriched gas could then mix with the pristine gas in other clots . in this way",
    "ba abundances below the production of a single h event for [ fe / h ]  @xmath105 could be obtained .",
    "for example , the abundances in the star at the left corner of region a could be explained by a mixture of gas outflow after an h event with the gas in a pristine clot ( mixing ratio @xmath106  1:10 ) .",
    "we have avoided the complexities of mixing and exchange in our previous discussion based on a standard mixing mass .",
    "subsequent models must address these issues .",
    "the chronometric interpretation of [ fe / h ] is complex .",
    "condensation of matter to form stars during the early evolution of the galaxy is expected to have been greatly extended in space and time ( @xmath107@xmath108  yr ) .",
    "this means that clots of baryonic matter formed within the galaxy at widely disparate times .",
    "the model proposed here only requires the following sequence of events to occur within a clot : an initial fe inventory from or prompt fe enrichment by supermassive stars , enhancement in heavy @xmath0-elements by h events , and enrichment in fe and light @xmath0-elements by l events .",
    "so long as different clots of baryonic matter within the galaxy underwent the same evolution , this sequence of events can be established independent of which stars observed today represent the same initial clot . however , this same sequence of events might have started at widely different times within different clots . in this sense , until chemical enrichment became essentially uniform on the galactic scale , stellar abundances at low metallicities would only reflect relative time in the above sequence . finally , if galaxies formed @xmath109  yr after the big bang , the epoch of supermassive star formation discussed here would correspond to a redshift of at least @xmath110 [ for which the age of the universe is @xmath111  yr ] .",
    "this epoch is earlier than the one probed by recent abundance observations at `` high '' redshifts ( @xmath112 , pettini et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we thank roger blandford , wallace sargent , charles steidel , and stan woosley for helpful discussions and roberto gallino for seeking to keep us on the rich road of ba and proper mixing .",
