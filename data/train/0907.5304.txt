    "the bound - free electron - positron pair production plays an important role at modern colliders such as the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) or the large hadron colliders ( lhc ) , since it may restrict the luminosity of the ion beams that will be available . especially in peripheral collisions of the ions",
    ", it is known that a large number of lepton pairs can be produced owing to the lorentz contracted electromagnetic fields that occur in course of the collisions . in the bound - free pair production ,",
    "the electron is captured by one of the colliding ions @xmath3 and leads to the loss of the ( one - electron ) ion from the beam .",
    "the bound - free pair production ( bfpp ) will therefore be an important problem at the lhc ; in fact , this process does not only reduce the intensity of the beam but also leads to a separate beam of one - electron ions that strikes the beam - pipe about 140 meters away from the interaction point . in the worst scenario",
    ", there might be enough energy in this separated beam to quench the lhc magnets as it was first pointed out by bruce @xcite but was investigated in further detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a first computation on the bound - free pair production cross sections were performed by baltz , rhoades - brown and weneser @xcite in the mid 1990ies .",
    "these authors used large - basis coupled - channel dirac - equation of bfpp in their calculations .",
    "in particular , baltz and coworkers derived a simple formula for the bfpp cross sections at ultra - relativistic energies ( @xmath4 = 23 000 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the parameters independent of energy . in this expression for the cross section , the @xmath8 term represents the region of large impact parameters , and @xmath6 was calculated by using perturbation theory , while the parameter @xmath7 represents the contributions from small impact parameter and includes both , perturbative and non - perturbative parts .",
    "the production of bound - free electron - positron pairs was calculated also by bertulani and baur @xcite who used a semi - classical method in order to calculate the production of bound - free pairs at energies and for collision systems appropriate for the rhic facility . from these computations",
    "it was found that the bfpp cross sections for the capture of the electron into the @xmath9 excited states of the ion decreases with @xmath10 , which means a factor of 1/8 for the @xmath11-shell and to a net effect of all @xmath9 excited states of approximately 20  % in total @xcite .",
    "an alternative method was later applied by rhoades - brown and coworkers @xcite who performed an `` exact '' integration of the feynman diagrams by using monte - carlo techniques . in this work ,",
    "the cross section for the capture of an electron was obtained as the convolution of the amplitude of @xmath12 and @xmath13 feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , @xmath14 with the momentum distribution of the bound - state wave function .",
    "the results from these feynman - monte carlo computations were compared with the weizsacker - williams calculations by baur and bertulani @xcite and were found larger by about a factor of 3 , a discrepancy which was explained later in a comment by baur  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have calculated the cross section for the capture of an electron into the @xmath15-shell by applying a monte - carlo integration for the lowest - order feynman diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "this procedure is known also in the literature @xcite as the two - photon method since the colliding nuclei ( nucleus @xmath16 and nucleus @xmath17 ) exchange one photon ( total two photon ) and the two - photon - exchange diagrams are proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to our previous computations , where plane - waves were applied for both the electron and the positron @xcite , we here apply bound @xmath15-shell wave - functions for the electron as well as modified plane - waves functions for the positrons that includes a correction due to the distortion by the ` bound ' electron .",
    "in fact , this distortion of the positron wave function arises from the necessary ( re- ) normalization of the continuum waves in order to account for the reduction of the wave functions of the positron near to the nucleus to which the electron is localized @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "these ( one - particle ) functions are known as sommerfeld - maue wave functions for the positrons and darwin wave functions for the bound electrons .",
    "similar wave functions have been applied also in refs .",
    "@xcite for studying the captured electrons and free positrons .    in the next section ,",
    "we first present the formalism for evaluating the pair production cross sections with an electron bound to one of the ions .",
    "apart from the representation of the electron and positron states , this includes the analysis and a step - wise simplification of the bound - free amplitudes by using the wave functions from above . in section  iii ,",
    "then , the differential bfpp cross sections are calculated as function of the transverse and longitudinal momentum , the energy and rapidity , and especially for those collision energies of the ions that are relevant for the rhic and lhc facilities . a comparison of our monte carlo - feynman calculations with previous computations is made .",
    "finally , a few conclusions are drawn in section  iv .",
    "lowest - order perturbation theory in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has been applied to derive and calculate the cross section for generating bound - free electron - positron pairs in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . for this electron - positron bfpp process",
    ", the signature is that the electron is captured by one of the colliding ions , while the _ free _ positron leaves the collision system . in lowest qed order ,",
    "this process is described by the two feynman diagrams , the ( so - called ) _ direct _ and _ crossed _ terms , as depicted schematically in fig .",
