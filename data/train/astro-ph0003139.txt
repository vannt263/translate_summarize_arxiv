    "the steadily increasing amount of high - quality , high time - resolution x - ray data from galactic x - ray binaries , has stimulated vital interest in the characteristics of the rapid variability of these objects .",
    "the x - ray emission from both galactic black - hole candidates ( gbhcs ) and accreting neutron stars is known to vary on a wide range of time scales , sometimes showing quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in gbhcs ,",
    "such qpos have been detected at frequencies ranging from several mhz to @xmath0  hz .",
    "these qpos are most notable when the sources are in the low - hard or in the rare very high state .",
    "recently , correlations between the amplitudes and centroid frequencies of several types of qpos with the spectral characteristics of the source have been found in some objects ( @xcite , markwardt , swank , & taam 1999 , @xcite , muno , morgan & remillard 1999 ) .",
    "a general pattern emerging from these analyses is that the frequency of those types of qpos which do show a correlation with spectral properties , seems to increase with both the power - law and the disk black - body flux from the source .",
    "a surprising property of some types of qpos has recently been found in the 67 mhz qpo of grs  1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) , the 0.5  10  hz qpo of the same source ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and in the 0.3  3  hz qpo in xte  j1550 - 564 ( cui , zhang , & chen 2000 ) : while the phase lag at the qpo fundamental frequency is negative , the phase lag associated with the first harmonic was positive . in the case of the low - frequency qpo of grs  1915 + 105",
    ", even three harmonics were detected , and the phase lags were found to alternate between subsequent harmonics ( @xcite ) . the phase lag associated with the 0.5  10  hz qpo of grs  1915 + 105",
    "was found to change sign from positive to negative as the qpo frequency increases above @xmath1  hz ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these peculiar patterns are apparently completely counter - intuitive in the light of currently discussed models for the hard phase lags in x - ray binaries .",
    "models proposed to explain the hard phase lags are either based to the energy - dependent photon escape time in compton upscattering scenarios for the production of hard x - rays ( kazanas , hua & titarchuk 1997 , bttcher & liang 1998 ) , or due to intrinsic spectral hardening during x - ray flares , e.g. due to decreasing compton cooling in active regions pushed away from an underlying accretion disk in a patchy - corona model ( @xcite ) or due to density perturbations drifting inward through an adaf toward the event horizon ( bttcher & liang 1999 ) .",
    "these models dealt only with the continuum variability and did not consider the effects of qpos .",
    "in this paper we will explore the response of a two - phase accretion flow , consisting of an outer , cool , optically thick accretion disk and an inner , hot adaf ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , to a periodically varying soft photon input from the cool disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "a two - phase accretion flow with an inner adaf has been found to produce good fits to the photon spectra of , e.g. , several galactic x - ray binaries ( e.g. , narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 , @xcite , @xcite ) , low - luminosity agn ( @xcite ) and giant elliptical galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in ",
    "[ analytical ] , we describe the basic model setup according to this two - phase accretion flow , and derive an analytical estimate for the expected phase lags associated with the qpo and the first harmonic applicable in some simplified cases . a short description of the monte - carlo simulations used to solve the time - dependent radiation transport problem follows in  [ mc ] . in ",
    "[ grs1915 ] we describe a series of simulations designed specifically to explain the peculiar phase lag behavior associated with the 0.5  10  hz qpo in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "we summarize in  [ summary ] .",
    "the basic model setup , as motivated in the introduction , assumes that the inner portion of the accretion flow is described by an adaf , where the density profile is approximately given by a free - fall profile , @xmath2 , and the electron temperature is close to the virial temperature and thus scales as @xmath3 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that other hot two - temperature inner disk models would give similar results .",
    "the adaf exists out to a transition radius @xmath4 , beyond which the flow is organized in a standard optically thick , geometrically thin shakura - sunyaev disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transition radius is typically expected to be several  @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius . outside this transition radius , the disk temperature scales as @xmath7 . with the free - fall density profile given above",
    ", the radial thomson depth of the corona may be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the accretion rate through the adaf in units of @xmath10  g  s@xmath11 , @xmath12 is the mass of the central compact object in units of solar masses , and @xmath13 is the inner edge of the adaf in units of schwarzschild radii .",
    "the basic assumption of our baseline model is that the observed qpos in the x - ray variability of galactic black - hole candidates are related to small - scale oscillations of the transition radius .",
    "such oscillations in @xmath14 may be caused by variations of the accretion rate , but we defer a detailed study of possible mechanisms driving the oscillations to a later paper .",
    "we thus assume that , as a function of time @xmath15 , the transition radius oscillates as @xmath16)$ ] , where @xmath17 is the amplitude of the oscillation and @xmath18 the qpo frequency . denoting @xmath19 , the time - dependent disk flux",
    "may then be estimated as @xmath20 ^ 2 \\ ,   [ t_d ( t)]^4 \\propto ( r_{\\rm tr } \\ , \\xi)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "in the following , we are focusing on an analytical description of the x - ray signals at the qpo fundamental and first harmonic frequencies .",
    "thus , we will expand all expressions up to the 2nd order in @xmath21 .",

    "note that additional hard x - ray emission will be produced by comptonization of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung photons produced in the inner portions of the adaf .",
    "however , since we do not assume significant changes of the structure of the inner adaf in the course of the small - scale oscillations of the transition radius , this internal synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission will constitute a quasi - dc flux component which does not contribute significantly to the variability properties of the source .",
    "being mainly interested in the quasi - periodic variability , we do not consider this emission component here .",
    "the time - dependent comptonization response function to the oscillating disk flux in this geometry can be parametrized as    @xmath27    ( @xcite ) , where now @xmath15 is the observing time , @xmath28 is the time of soft photon emission at the transition radius , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the heaviside function , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are normalization factors which are generally energy and time dependent . in the general case , the indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the time `` constant '' @xmath35 also depend on photon energy and time ( @xmath35 depends on time through the time - dependence of the extent of the corona and the disk photon energy ) .    the observable energy flux at time @xmath15 at photon energy @xmath24",

    "the parameter @xmath33 is generally energy dependent .",
    "however , we find that a constant value of @xmath45 yields a reasonably good description of the multiple - scattering light curve for an adaf - like temperature and density profile . to the same degree of approximation",

    "we adopt the convention that positive phase and time lags correspond to hard photons lagging the soft ones .",
    "intuitively , phase and time lags between the disk - radiation dominated low - energy photons and the compton - upscattering dominated high - energy photons are determined by the ratio between the qpo period @xmath78 and the time required for soft photons to reach the inner adaf region and be compton upscattered to hard x - ray energies . if this light - travel and diffusion time is _ longer than half a qpo period , but less than the qpo period itself _ , the phase lag at the qpo fundamental frequency  which physically is still a hard lag  appears as a _ soft lag _ due to the periodicity of the light curves .",

    "the figure demonstrates that the two approaches are in excellent agreement , indicating that our numerical procedure reliably reproduces the time - dependent radiation transport properties of the model system .",
    "as briefly mentioned in the introduction , the variable - frequency qpo at 0.5  10  hz observed in the low - hard state of grs  1915 + 105 exhibits a very peculiar phase lag behavior ( @xcite ) : if the source has a rather hard ( photon index @xmath92 ) photon spectrum and low x - ray flux , the qpo frequency is low @xmath93  hz , and the phase lags associated with both the qpo fundamental and the first harmonic frequencies are positive .",

    "spectral fits to grs  1915 + 105 with a disk blackbody + power - law model to different spectra states along this sequence revealed that the inner disk temperature increases from @xmath96  kev to @xmath97  kev as the qpo frequency increases from 0.5 to 10  hz ( @xcite ) .    in order to model this behavior ,",
    "we parametrize the disk temperature at the transition radius , @xmath98 , and the qpo frequency as power - laws in @xmath14 . assuming @xmath99 , a simple power - law relation spanning the observed ranges of @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( @xcite ) yields a scaling @xmath102 .",
    "this scaling may indicate that the transition radius oscillations are related to a modulation of the disk evaporation process , responsible for the transition to the inner adaf , by a secular instability .",
    "the frequency of such modulations might be proportional to the inverse of the evaporation time scale , @xmath103 , which is expected to be proportional to the disk surface flux , @xmath104 .",

    "we perform a series of 6 simulations , each with different values of @xmath14 , implying different qpo frequencies and disk temperatures according to the scaling laws quoted above .",
    "two representative examples of the resulting power and phase lag spectra are shown in figs .",
    "[ 7hz ] and [ 1hz ] for a high - frequency ( 6.7  hz ) case with alternating phase lags and a low - frequency ( 1.1  hz ) case with positive phase lags at both fundamental and first harmonic frequencies , respectively .",
    "the results of the complete series of simulations are listed in table [ tab1915 ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fit1915 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fit1915 ] we see that this model reproduces the key features of the peculiar qpo phase lag behavior observed in grs  1915 + 105 , in particular the change of sign of the phase lag associated with the qpo as the qpo centroid frequency increases , and the alternating phase lags between qpo fundamental and first harmonic at high qpo frequencies .",
    "we point out that the measured values of the hard lags at the first harmonic frequency for @xmath113  hz are significantly smaller than predicted by our model .",
    "however , this is expected because , for realistic signal - to - noise ratios , the ( random - phase ) poisson noise contaminating the actual data always suppresses high phase lag values , but leaves small values of @xmath114 almost unaffected ( zhang 2000 , private communication ) .",

    "[ fit1915 ] also show the predicted phase lags at the second harmonic of the qpo , which has not been observed yet .",
    "we expect that , if a second harmonic is found in any future or archived observation of grs  1915 + 105 , it should be associated with a negative phase lag , at least for @xmath113  hz .",
    "we need to point out that the more complicated case discussed in this section is not directly comparable to the test cases illustrated in fig .",
    "[ analytic_comp ] since we are now varying the accretion disk temperature and the qpo frequency when varying the transition radius .",
    "this also changes the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath35 entering the analytical estimates as a function of @xmath14 in a non - trivial way .",
    "we have investigated the time - dependent x - ray emission from an oscillating two - phase accretion flow , consisting of an outer , cool , optically thin accretion disk , and an inner adaf . based on this model",
    ", we are proposing an explanation for the peculiar phase lag behavior associated with the variable - frequency 0.5  10  hz qpos observed in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "in particular , the changing sign of the phase lag at the qpo fundamental frequency as the qpo frequency increases , and the alternating phase lags between qpo fundamental and first harmonic frequencies in the case of a high qpo frequency are well reproduced by this model .",
    "the relation between qpo frequency , transition radius and inner disk radius can be interpreted physically , if the qpo is triggered by a modulation of the transition radius by a secular instability affecting the disk evaporation responsible for the disk / adaf transition . based on our results for grs  1915 + 105 , we predict that , if a second harmonic to the variable - frequency qpo at @xmath113  hz is detected , it should be associated with a negative phase lag .",
    "we found that oscillations at the transition radius can naturally lead to apparent soft lags associated with the qpo frequency , if the photon diffusion time related to the production of hard x - rays is longer than half a qpo period .",
    "we point out that it is very unlikely that the same mechanism is responsible for the alternating phase lags observed in the 67  mhz qpos and its harmonics since this would require a transition radius at @xmath115",
    ". this large size of the adaf is implausible for a non - quiescent state .",
    "the 67  mhz qpo alternating phase lag pattern has been observed in a high - flux state of grs  1915 + 105 , in which we would generally expect the disk to extend down to rather small radii .",
    "one caveat of the model we have proposed here is that it requires a rather large accretion rate in order to produce the observed disk luminosity from grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "this , in turn , requires either that a large fraction of the accreted mass is lost to the collimated outflow of the radio jets , or that the adaf has a very low radiative efficiency in order not to overproduce the hard power - law emission from the hot adaf .",
    "however , since grs  1915 + 105 is known to have very powerful , superluminal radio jets ( @xcite ) , it is plausible to assume that , indeed , a significant fraction of the mass accreted through the outer disk is not advected through the adaf , but is powering the radio jets .",
