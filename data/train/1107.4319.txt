    "this could be taken as another hint for physics beyond the two standard models .",
    "the planck satellite , which is already taking data , could turn the hint into a discovery .",
    "we should search for explanations from particle physics for such an increase in radiation  @xcite , especially , because other explanations are missing , if the current mean values are accurate . since tailoring an otherwise unmotivated solution to",
    "this particular problem is trivial , the origin of the additional radiation should be motivated from other problems of cosmology and the standard model .",
    "ideally a consistent cosmology is possible at the same time and without further ingredients . in this letter",
    "we propose a natural origin of the late emergence of the additional radiation of exactly this kind from supersymmetry ( susy ) that itself is well known to be motivated independently .",
    "supersymmetric theories predict the gravitino as the superpartner of the graviton . from gravity mediated susy breaking , its mass @xmath1 is expected to set the scale of the soft susy breaking masses of the superpartner in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as @xmath2 .",

    ". the spontaneous breakdown of the pq symmetry gives rise to a goldstone boson  called axion @xmath5accompanied by another scalar  called saxion and the axino @xmath6  carrying the fermionic degrees of freedom of the axion supermultiplet that has interactions suppressed by the pq scale @xmath7 .",
    "it has been recognised that an axino of mass @xmath8  @xcite as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) with a gravitino next - to - lsp of mass @xmath9 might provide a natural solution to the cosmological gravitino problem  @xcite .",
    "since any gravitino abundance decays invisibly into axino - axion pairs , reheating temperatures as high as @xmath10 were claimed to be possible .",
    "due to their suppressed couplings axion and axino are indeed decoupled from the thermal bath at such late times when the gravitino decays .",
    "the axino is light to avoid overproduction . at the same time",
    ", the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle ( losp ) can decay into axino and photon .",
    "altogether , decay problems and overproduction constraints are circumvented .",
    "recently , an extensive investigation of the phenomenological viability of the considered mass hierarchy , @xmath11 , reports on numerous restrictions of the pq and mssm parameter space  @xcite .",
    "in particular , much tighter constraints on the reheating temperature dependent on the pq scale and/or arising from the assumed bino losp were found . in this letter",
    "we point out that the reheating temperature is also constrained from the allowed amount of relativistic particles decoupled from the thermal bath .",
    "such  dark radiation  arises from the gravitino decays , because the axions and axinos with @xmath12 are emitted relativistically and thus contribute to the radiation energy density .",
    "this has not been considered so far .",
    "since the amount of dark radiation is constrained by different observations , we find a new upper bound on the reheating temperature , i.e. , @xmath13 , which is four orders of magnitude tighter than the original one .",
    "this bound is completely independent of the pq parameter space and its dependence on the mssm parameter space is quite limited .",
    "however , any conclusion in this letter relies on the prerequisite that the gravitino is lighter than the losp and the axino is the lsp .",
    "the coincidence of the required temperature for successful standard thermal leptogenesis and the new upper bound on the reheating temperature opens up the opportunity to explain the increase in the radiation energy density by the decay of the gravitino , that produces unavoidably dark radiation after bbn .",
    "we show that at the same time axion and axino can naturally form the observed dark matter .",
    "bounds on the radiation energy density are usually given in terms of the effective number of neutrino species @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 where the radiation energy density @xmath16 is given as a sum of the energy density in photons @xmath17 , the energy density in the neutrinos of the standard model with @xmath18  @xcite and @xmath19 and any departure from the standard scenario parametrised as @xmath20 . since the radiation energy density affects the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath21 can be constrained .",

    "the universe becomes transparent for photons .",
    "we observe the surface of last scattering today as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the current constraints from observations of the cmb are much stronger than previous ones  @xcite but still significantly weaker than those from bbn .",
    "measurements from the wmap satellite  @xcite using the first and third acoustic peaks and the ground - based act  @xcite using observations of the third through the seventh peaks are complementary , since they span a broad range of scales .",
    "this allows an estimate from the cmb alone  @xcite @xmath31 recently the ground - based spt published  @xcite @xmath32 combined with measurements of today s hubble expansion rate @xmath33 and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) the current constraints are  @xcite @xmath34 and  @xcite @xmath35 respectively .",
    "these limits are consistent with @xmath36 at the 2-@xmath37 level and any deviation may well be due to systematic errors . however , there is a hint of tension and the central values are off the standard value by @xmath38 .",

    "improvements in the determination of @xmath42 became crucial .",
    "to have an effect on the effective number of neutrino species measured from the cmb , it is necessary that the additional radiation is generated before the observable modes of the cmb have reentered the horizon .",
    "this requirement constrains the maximum lifetime @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "this time is before the time of matter - radiation equality , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the late emergence of visible radiation like photons is practically excluded .",
    "this would not only spoil the success of bbn , but also induce a chemical potential for the photons that is bounded by cmb observations .",
    "the observations discussed in the previous section constrain the emergence of dark radiation . not to affect bbn and to have an effect on measurements of @xmath14 from the cmb , the lifetime of a decaying matter particle is constrained to lie in the range @xmath45 or , equivalently , the cosmic temperature at the particle decay @xmath46 . since @xmath44 in standard cosmology",
    "the universe is radiation dominated at these times , so that @xmath47 .",
    "we estimate the gravitino decay width with the following considerations . in the gravitino center - of - mass frame",
    "its two - body decay width is in general given by @xmath48 if both decay products are much lighter than the gravitino , their equal with opposite sign 3-momenta , @xmath49=@xmath50 , are well approximated by the leading term in @xmath51 .",
    "the squared amplitude @xmath52 is on dimensional grounds @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the reduced planck mass .",
    "we have to sum over the outgoing axino spins and average over the incoming gravitino spins , which gives a factor @xmath55 .",
    "the rest of the squared amplitude will be a factor @xmath56 , where at the leading order the gravitino polarisation sum gives a factor @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that a detailed analysis renders the typical additional factor @xmath58 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath59 are usually @xmath60 .",
    "altogether , we estimate the gravitino decay width @xmath61 with an expected error of the order @xmath62 . as @xmath63",
    ", we obtain the gravitino lifetime @xmath64 or , equivalently , @xmath65 .",
    "we see that the gravitino decay is expected to happen within the considered range  .",
    "the mass range for the gravitino to decay within   is @xmath66 .",
    "thus most sparticle spectra expected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are allowed from this perspective and as soon as susy is discovered the gravitino next - to - lsp mass is constrained to a small window . since the axino is the lsp , the gravitino next - to - lsp decays into axino and axion .",
    "other gravitino channels emitting gluons or photons are never restrictive . due to an additional pq vertex suppressed by the pq scale ,",
    "the branching ratio of such processes is extremely small .",
    "we find the emitted energy at least twelve orders of magnitudes below current limits .",
    "qualitatively , this holds true even if @xmath67-parity were broken as long as the breaking is not too large .",
    "@xmath67-parity violating decays of the gravitino in two standard model particles were still gravitational decays and additionally suppressed by the @xmath67-parity violating coupling .",
    "therefore , the viability of the late emergence of dark radiation in this scenario does not depend on conserved @xmath67-parity .",
    "we expect the upper bound on @xmath67-parity violating couplings from leptogenesis to be more constraining .",
    "since the axion and also the axino are much lighter than the decaying gravitino , both are emitted with relativistic momenta , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the energy density in dark radiation @xmath69 consisting of the axion and the axino is given by the energy density of the gravitino at its decay .",
    "it is @xmath70 where the entropy density @xmath71 could depend on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the thermal bath @xmath72 and their corresponding temperatures .",
    "however , for the times considered in this section @xmath73 is fix .",
    "if we would not make use of the sudden - decay approximation , the resulting energy density would differ by a factor @xmath74 only  @xcite .",
    "the thermally produced gravitino yield @xmath75 is estimated as  @xcite @xmath76 where , as in the following , @xmath77 denotes the gluino mass at @xmath78 . since at times after bbn @xmath79 is fix , the energy density of dark radiation scales equal to the energy density of radiation in the thermal bath , even though dark radiation is not coupled to the bath .",
    "thus it is most easy to calculate @xmath80 at the gravitino decay .",
    "using   and   the change of the effective number of neutrino species by the gravitino decay at any time after bbn is given by @xmath81 this is a number of @xmath82 and could have been a priori anything .",
    "this coincidence for parameter values motivated by completely disconnected reasons is the key observation of the present work .",
    "we remind that the gluino is expected to be among the heaviest sparticles and the gravitino next - to - lsp with @xmath83 is not only motivated from susy breaking , but is part of the solution of the gravitino problem as described in the introduction .",
    "this opens up the opportunity for thermal leptogenesis that requires a reheating temperature sufficiently larger than @xmath84 .",
    "the crucial experimental input to determine the minimal temperature are future measurements of the light neutrino masses .    using   and  as function of the gravitino mass @xmath1 for three different values of the gluino mass @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we restrict @xmath87 .",
    "the shaded regions show the corresponding parameter space consistent with our scenario . indicated are bounds from late and early enough gravitino decay  .",
    "as discussed successful thermal leptogenesis requires @xmath88 sufficiently larger than @xmath84 .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to values of @xmath89 .",
    "this is the possible planck 2-@xmath37 exclusion limit , if the observed central value coincides with the standard model expectation .",
    "the star corresponds to parameter values as appearing in  . ]    for the approximations made and fixed sparticle masses as in   we could state that @xmath90 is excluded at the 5-@xmath37 level referring to the bound   on the effective number of neutrino species . for a fixed reheating temperature the gravitino can not be much lighter , since its mass has the largest exponent in   and the gluino mass is bounded from below by experiments . the other way around , for a fixed mass ratio a heavier gravitino does not allow for much higher reheating temperatures .",
    "thus we find an upper bound , @xmath0 , four orders of magnitude tighter than in the original work  @xcite .",
    "different upper bounds on the reheating temperature depending on the gravitino mass are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : m32-tr ] for different values of the gluino mass .",
    "the upper bound does not depend at all on the parameters describing the axion multiplet .",
    "even if the axino were allowed to be heavy , such that it would not be emitted relativistically , the emitted radiation energy would reduce by a factor of 2 only .",
    "this is due to the axion that still carries half of the energy . in this sense ,",
    "the upper bound does not rely on the very light axino .",
    "a dependence on the mssm parameters enters through the gravitino yield   only . since a certain , finite mass gap between gluino and gravitino next -",
    "to - lsp is well - motivated , we find this dependence quite limited . that @xmath80 in   is of order one opens up another possibility .",
    "an increase in @xmath14 as discussed in the previous section might be predicted by the scenario of successful thermal leptogenesis where a light axino solves the gravitino problem , because the , in general unknown , reheating temperature becomes practically fixed . for temperatures required by thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "larger @xmath3 were allowed while the predicted increase in @xmath80 were unchanged . ]",
    "this is especially appealing in a time where current ( on - going ) experiments might measure two of the unknowns in  .",
    "as mentioned above the planck satellite mission might reveal a @xmath91 and the lhc as collider experiment might measure the gaugino masses , in particular the gluino mass . furthermore",
    ", as soon as susy is discovered this sheds light on the mass of a gravitino assumed lighter than the lightest superpartner in the mssm .",
    "the collider phenomenology is not distinguishable from the axino lsp case without gravitino , which could itself be mistaken as the neutralino lsp case .",
    "however , in contrast to give an example heavy charged losps may leave the detector .",
    "this would immediately imply that dark matter is not formed by neutralinos .",
    "interestingly , the reheating temperature in an axino lsp scenario might be probed at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "it is important to know at what time the emitted particles become nonrelativistic . in general , particles become nonrelativistic at the temperature when their momenta become equal to their mass , i.e. ,  @xmath92 . in the rest frame of a particle decaying into two much lighter particles",
    "the decay products carry a momentum @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denotes the mass of the decaying particle . after the decay these momenta decrease due to the expansion of the universe . in our scenario",
    "this yields for the axino @xmath95 assuming @xmath96 we obtain @xmath97 since this temperature is much smaller than the temperature of the universe today @xmath98 , axinos of mass @xmath99 were surely still relativistic today and thus contribute as radiation to today s energy budget of the universe . for larger axino masses",
    "@xmath100 these axinos would become nonrelativistic today and for even larger masses @xmath101 these axinos became nonrelativistic in between .",
    "they were relativistic at photon decoupling and nonrelativistic today .",
    "however , the contribution of these axinos as dark matter is suppressed by the small mass ratio @xmath62 .",
    "since the axion is much lighter than the axino , as @xmath102 , the emitted axions are still relativistic today for all possible parameter values .",
    "if we require the gravitino to never dominate the energy density of the universe , we find a constraint on @xmath3 similar to the one found above .",
    "this is expected , because the universe is dominated by radiation around the gravitino decay and the decay emits a substantial amount of radiation energy . however , there is no significant amount of entropy produced in the gravitino decay even if it dominates at its decay , because the decay products do not thermalise .",
    "thus cosmological abundances are not diluted and a period of matter domination after nucleosynthesis and before matter - radiation equality is not excluded by these considerations . instead , a long period of matter domination is excluded by measurements of the radiation energy density as  ,  ,   and  .",
    "the situation seems more involved for the time window between @xmath103 and @xmath30 .",
    "it seems reasonable that the release of a huge amount of dark radiation from a dominating matter particle at these times affects the cmb in an observable way even though maybe only at lower multipoles .",
    "an analysis of this situation is beyond the scope of this letter and proposed as future research .",
    "in the considered scenario neither the gravitino nor the losp can account for the observed dark matter , but the axion and the axino might be natural candidates . as their production depends on the peccei - quinn scale @xmath104 , we need to consider constraints on it from losp decay . is called peccei - quinn scale with @xmath105 denoting the scale of pq symmetry breaking if @xmath106 denotes the number of different vacua . for the ksvz ( dfsz ) model @xmath107 . ]",
    "the losp has to decay early enough not to spoil the success of bbn .",
    "we remind that the constraints on the losp are greatly relaxed compared to the gravitino lsp case , because it decays much faster , since @xmath108 .    since the lightest neutralino is likely one of the lightest superparticles , we consider the case of the neutralino being the losp and thus its decay into axino and photon . in general",
    ", the decay width depends on the bino component , the phase space , the axion model and its implementation  @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath109 with @xmath110 . using @xmath111",
    "we obtain the upper bound @xmath112 where we demand the bino lifetime @xmath113 to be at most @xmath114 , which is supposed to be conservative .",
    "if also the decay into @xmath6  and z boson is kinematically unsuppressed , the bound is additionally relaxed by a factor of two . note",
    "that a substantial wino or higgsino component lowers the relic density of the neutralino , such that a much later decay becomes allowed with @xmath115  @xcite .",
    "thus a mixed bino - wino or bino - higgsino state may allow for @xmath104 even larger than @xmath116 already for neutralino masses close to @xmath117 .",
    "the dfsz  @xcite axino couples to higgsino - higgs and sfermion - fermion via dimension-4 operators . thus higgsino and stau can be the losp .",
    "these channels easily allow for @xmath104 even larger than @xmath116 as soon as they are kinematically open .",
    "estimates for any losp candidate can be taken from  @xcite and references therein , respectively . has been considered .",
    "thus losp and axino need to be interchanged in the process .",
    "a recent comprehensive study of stau losp constraints is found in  @xcite . ] for losp masses as large as the upper bound on the gravitino mass , @xmath118 as following from  , peccei - quinn scales as large as @xmath119 become allowed already for a bino losp and other losp candidates might even allow for @xmath120 .",
    "axino and axion are produced in the early universe .",
    "the axino is produced in thermal scatterings after inflation , while the axion is dominantly produced nonthermally from the vacuum misalignment mechanism  @xcite or possible topological defects  @xcite .",
    "due to its tiny mass the thermally produced axion density is negligible . in the ksvz  @xcite model with heavy exotic quarks the relic axino energy density in units of today",
    "s critical energy density @xmath121 with @xmath122 has been calculated in  @xcite to @xmath123 this is already close to its density if the axino enters thermal equilibrium @xmath124 .",
    "a recent study  @xcite reports that this abundance can be suppressed , if the ksvz quarks are lighter than the scale of pq symmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore , the axino yield is reported to become independent of the reheating temperature in the dfsz model , @xmath125 for @xmath126 , where we also indicate that the dfsz axino is in addition produced via `` freeze - in '' from heavy higgsino and/or higgs decays  @xcite .",
    "the yield from freeze - in is again proportional to @xmath127 and independent of the reheating temperature , but dependent on the higgsino and higgs masses . in the following three paragraphs we sketch different example scenarios to account for the observed dark matter in the considered setting .",

    "we mention that an admixture of such light axinos could be favoured from problems of small scale structure formation  @xcite .",
    "the dfsz axino might be allowed heavier , @xmath134 , but this depends on the relative contributions from the different production mechanisms .",

    "the dfsz axino , however , could constitute warm dark matter with @xmath138 in this case .",
    "thereby it could even be dominantly produced by freeze - in .",
    "altogether , for @xmath136 the dark matter could be formed by warm dfsz axinos .",
    "much smaller peccei - quinn scales are disfavoured for both axion models , because the reheating temperature would need to be lowered , so that standard thermal leptogenesis were excluded .",
    "_ iii beyond lhc : _ from the above discussion we have seen , that pq scales as large as @xmath139 with correspondingly heavier sparticles are not forbidden for many losp candidates .",
    "surely , @xmath140 needs to be suppressed by a vanishing misalignment angle in this case and such heavy sparticles are disfavoured in order to stabilise the higgs mass .",
    "the ksvz as well as the dfsz axino could form cold dark matter in this scenario with a much smaller mass gap to the gravitino . in this case , the axino is considerably produced from losp decays  , such that a losp with a small freeze - out abundance is required , and also the gravitino produces a substantial amount of cold axinos .",
    "anyway , it is possible  but not arbitrarily  to have the desired dark radiation in form of axions , a consistent cosmology and no signal at colliders , because all detectable particles are beyond the discovery range of the lhc .    besides the production from the discussed mechanisms ,",

    "the saxion yield @xmath171 can not be smaller than the equilibrium value @xmath172 .",
    "the appearing saxion mass @xmath173 in   is chosen to show the worst situation in the considered scenario . like",
    "a smaller @xmath104 or a larger @xmath174 , also a larger @xmath165 leads to an earlier decay , which corresponds to a smaller @xmath175 at its decay .",
    "thus there is a self - curing effect for large @xmath165  @xcite .",
    "the bound   represents an implicit equation for the self - coupling @xmath165 . evaluating it for @xmath165 with parameters fixed as appearing in",
    "it turns out that there is , indeed , no constraint on @xmath165 , because branching ratios are by definition smaller than one .    for larger @xmath176 and fixed @xmath88",
    "the saxion does no longer enter thermal equilibrium .",
    "if we assume its yield equals the axino yield as in  , we can insert @xmath177 into  . evaluating again for @xmath165",
    "we find , that any constraint on @xmath165 disappears in the same sense as before , if @xmath178 .",
    "considering @xmath179 and larger @xmath174 we see from inserting   into  , that both parameters , if raised like that , lead to a vanishing bound on @xmath165 .",
    "even though @xmath180 from saxion decay is consistent with all existing measurements , for deviations of the effective number of neutrino species @xmath181 it would be an unfortunate case considering the discovery potential of planck .",
    "a 3-@xmath37 detection would become impossible . from the discussion above we see that @xmath80 from saxion decay can well be small for natural parameter values .",
    "for @xmath182 it is expected small in any case and especially for @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "how to achieve a desired value of it , is described in  @xcite .",
    "one can consider cases with a significant deviation from the standard model expectation during bbn and an even larger deviation at photon decoupling , i.e. , @xmath185 .",
    "we do not comment further on this possibility .",
    "note that if the dfsz saxion can decay into a higgs pair , this decay might become stronger than the gluon decay channel .",
    "this reduces the amount of emitted axions .",
    "altogether , we see that we have to consider the saxion decay into two axions , especially for the considered scenario .",
    "however , depending on the actually measured value from planck this leads to acceptable or mild constraints on the saxion mass . in general ,",
    "the emergence of dark radiation before bbn would be constrained by a better determination of the effective number of neutrino species during bbn .",
    "note that bounds on the initial oscillation amplitude are not affected by the absence of the nlsp problem .",
    "practically , we assume a mechanism that sets the initial amplitude @xmath157 .",
    "the key observation of the present work is : the increase in the effective number of neutrino species in   by the invisible gravitino decay after bbn but before photon decoupling is of @xmath164 for expected ( natural ) masses and a reheating temperature motivated by successful standard thermal leptogenesis , which is a completely disconnected notion .",
    "thereby the presupposed mass hierarchy , @xmath11 , was motivated to solve the cosmological gravitino problem by in some sense  the cosmological axino problem .",
    "indeed , we have found a new upper bound on the reheating temperature  @xmath0 in this scenario .",
    "since the decay is gravitational , it occurs generically late and the bound does not at all depend on the peccei - quinn parameter space .",
    "the only requirement on the mssm parameter space stems from thermal gravitino production .",
    "it is a large enough but finite mass gap between gluino and gravitino next - to - lsp .",
    "since neither losp nor gravitino are dark matter candidates in the considered scenario , it is not granted that there are natural dark matter candidates at all .",
    "we have found that the axion may naturally form the observed amount of cold dark matter without any conflict with bbn from late losp decay . to this end , we commented on the bbn constraints from different losp candidates extending previous analyses .",
    "estimates can be made for any mssm sparticle using  @xcite .",
    "we mentioned that an admixture of thermally produced , light axinos may be favoured from small scale problems of structure formation .",
    "it seems that the dfsz axino can form warm dark matter for smaller @xmath170 .",
    "the identification of consistent cosmologies and their corresponding parameter space with the desired increase in radiation calls for more comprehensive studies .",
    "we have checked that the scenario is save against other gravitino decay channels and radiation from losp decay .",
    "constraints from and on the saxion are absent or moderate ( with the exception of the bound on its initial oscillation amplitude @xmath157 ) , because it is allowed to produce losps at any time before bbn as in  @xcite .",
    "the most severe lower bound on the saxion mass can arise from its decay into an axion pair .",
    "we find these bounds in the worst scenario still acceptable .",
    "the collider phenomenology is not distinguishable from the axino lsp case without gravitino . even though we have also shown that the lhc can not rule out the scenario , we want to point out its surprisingly high testability considering that gravitino and axino are generally elusive particles and the reheating temperature is not an experimentally accessible quantity . combining the new opportunity to measure the effective number of neutrino species from the cmb alone and the potential discovery of supersymmetry at the lhc , two of the unknowns in   can be determined and within the scenario the gravitino mass would be constrained to a small window as , therefore , the reheating temperature as well .",
    "the viability of thermal leptogenesis in this scenario were tested and the cosmological gravitino problem would turn out as a fortune when the planck mission indeed discovers an increased radiation energy density . in turn , that discovery would provide indirect evidence for this particular scenario .",
    "i am deeply grateful to jrn kersten for his support and encouragement .",
