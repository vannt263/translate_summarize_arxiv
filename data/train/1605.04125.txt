    "the  affine \" algebras controlling the jucys  murphy elements of the symmetric group and of the finite hecke algebra of type a are actually particular examples of affine hecke algebras ( degenerate , or graded , for the symmetric group ) .",
    "they are affine hecke algebras associated to @xmath0 . in general , affine",
    "hecke algebras are associated to root data coming from algebraic reductive groups , and a well - known motivation is that their representation theory forms a part of the representation theory of reductive groups defined over @xmath1-adic fields .",
    "an affine hecke algebra comes equipped with a distinguished commutative subalgebra . in the case of @xmath0 , the jucys",
    "murphy elements of the symmetric group and of the finite hecke algebra of type a are obtained as images ( in a well - chosen quotient ) of well - chosen generators of this commutative subalgebra .",
    "this is the reason for the fact that representations of affine hecke algebras of @xmath0 appear in the study of these jucys ",
    "murphy elements .",
    "in fact , in this setting , only a part of the representation theory of affine hecke algebras is used .",
    "namely , the representations involved are the ones in which the elements of the distinguished commutative subalgebra act semisimply . such representations are called _ calibrated _ ( sometimes also completely splittable @xcite , or in another context , homogeneous @xcite ) .    for the affine hecke algebras of gl , the irreducible calibrated representations are classified and described combinatorially in terms of skew partitions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the degenerate case , by restriction to the symmetric group ,",
    "one recovers the so - called  skew \" representations .",
    "they were introduced and studied for example in @xcite , originally in connections with the littlewood ",
    "richardson rule . in the non - degenerate case ,",
    "one obtains by restriction the analogues of skew representations for the finite hecke algebra of type a , whose decompositions into irreducibles also involve littlewood  richardson coefficients @xcite .",
    "calibrated representations were classified in @xcite for affine hecke algebras associated to the weight lattice of a root system of arbitrary type . here , we will follow a different line of generalisation by considering different affine hecke algebras .",
    "as far as affine hecke algebras are concerned , we generalise the construction for the affine hecke algebra of gl in terms of skew partitions . besides , our point of view on the affine hecke algebras considered here is also that , in the spirit explained above , they are algebraic structures controlling some sort of combinatorics , that we apply to representations , in this case , of finite hecke algebras and weyl groups of type ade .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ] * 3 . * + + + +    one goal of this paper is to provide a whole class of combinatorial models for representations of finite hecke algebras and weyl groups of type ade .",
    "we will mostly work at the level of some affine hecke algebras of type ade and actually construct irreducible ( calibrated ) representations of these affine hecke algebras .",
    "representations of finite hecke algebras are then obtained simply by restriction , and representations of weyl groups are obtained by a limiting procedure .",
    "main ingredients in the construction are new sets of combinatorial objects equipped with actions of the corresponding weyl groups . these combinatorial objects are built from and generalise the usual young tableaux associated to ( skew ) partitions .",
    "representations are constructed by explicit formulas , generalising the seminormal representations of the symmetric group associated to ( skew ) partitions .",
    "another goal of this paper is to introduce and study some affine hecke algebras ( of type ade ) .",
    "the combinatorial constructions evoked above are controlled by those affine hecke algebras .",
    "we emphasize their fundamental role by introducing them as the starting point of our study .",
    "they generalise in a natural sense the affine hecke algebra of gl . as for gl",
    ", they are associated to reductive groups ( of type ade ) which are not semisimple .",
    "however , as an independent motivation to consider them , they admit certain quotients by a distinguished central element which are isomorphic to affine hecke algebras associated to semisimple groups ( the most studied cases ) .",
    "this will be more detailed below .    for each type ( a , d or e )",
    ", our construction depends on a chosen vertex of the corresponding dynkin diagram .",
    "the classical construction for the symmetric group with the usual partitions then corresponds to type a with the chosen vertex being an extremity of the dynkin diagram .",
    "so , already for the symmetric group , we obtain new combinatorial constructions : those associated to a vertex which is not one of the two extremities of the dynkin diagram .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ] * 4 . *",
    "+ + + +    we will now describe in more details the main objects and the organisation of the paper .",
    "we first introduce some affine hecke algebra of type ade ( section [ sec - def ] ) . given an irreducible root system @xmath2 of type ade , we take an arbitrary vertex @xmath3 of the dynkin diagram of @xmath2 , and construct an affine hecke algebra @xmath4 .",
    "the algebra @xmath4 is associated to a free @xmath5-module , denote @xmath6 , obtained by extending the root lattice of @xmath2 by one dimension ; the action of the weyl group on it depends on the choice of @xmath3 .    an important step is the choice of a basis of @xmath6",
    ". this will be the key to the combinatorial approach , as explained later .",
    "we also use this basis to work out explicitly a finite presentation by generators and relations of the algebra @xmath4 .",
    "this presentation helps to see that the algebra @xmath4 contains several ( up to 3 ) distinguished subalgebras isomorphic to affine hecke algebras of gl , and further how they are  glued \" together .",
    "it reflects a certain covering , depending on @xmath3 , of the dynkin diagram of @xmath2 by several ( up to 3 ) subdiagrams of type a.    it turns out that the free @xmath5-module @xmath6 contains an distinguished element , denoted @xmath7 , invariant under the action of the weyl group .",
    "furthermore , the quotient module @xmath8 turns out to coincide with the following one : the root lattice of @xmath2 extended by adding the fundamental weight corresponding to the vertex @xmath3 .",
    "this @xmath5-module , included between the root lattice and the weight lattice , automatically gives rise to an affine hecke algebra , that we denote @xmath9 , which now corresponds to a semisimple group , unlike @xmath4 .",
    "it follows from our construction that this algebra @xmath9 is isomorphic to the quotient of @xmath4 over a relation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a central element of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we will obtain informations on the representation theory of @xmath9 immediately from our results on @xmath4 .",
    "this could be an independent motivation for considering the algebras @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath3 varies among the set of vertices of the dynkin diagram of @xmath2 , we obtain different @xmath5-modules included between the root lattice of @xmath2 and the weight lattice of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that all such @xmath5-modules ( for types ade ) are obtained this way with the following exceptions : the root lattice of type @xmath12 and the weight lattice of type @xmath13 with @xmath14 even . to sum up , the algebras @xmath9 , when @xmath2 and @xmath3 vary , exhaust the set of affine hecke algebra of type ade associated with semisimple root data , with these two exceptions .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ] * 5 . *",
    "+ + + +    a crucial notion in our study is that of an action and a truncated action of the weyl group on sequences of numbers ( section [ sec - act ] ) .",
    "these sequences are identified with characters of the commutative subalgebra of @xmath4 , and this is done using the basis of @xmath6 chosen earlier .",
    "one goal will be to determine the characters appearing in calibrated representations ( _ i.e. _ the calibrated spectrum ) and to interpret them as combinatorial objects .",
    "the sequences form the intermediary step between characters and combinatorial objects .",
    "the action of the weyl group of @xmath2 is explicitly calculated on the chosen basis and is then translated as an action of the weyl group on sequences ( and later on tableaux ) .",
    "this action generalises the permutation action of the symmetric group .",
    "roughly speaking , the truncated action on a given sequence consists in  killing \" the action of some simple reflections .",
    "it is not an action of the weyl group anymore , however the important property is that the braid relations are still satisfied .",
    "this allows us to define a notion of orbits under this truncated action .",
    "some of these truncated orbits will parametrise the representations constructed later .",
    "the new combinatorial objects , the tableaux of type @xmath15 , are defined in section [ sec - tab ] .",
    "the action of the weyl group is described explicitly , in a combinatorial way .",
    "a new feature of the action of the weyl group , compared to the usual action of the symmetric group on tableaux , is that not only boxes are exchanged , but some of them sometimes also move to a different position .",
    "this results in the possibility that , starting from a tableau of type @xmath15 , one obtains , after applying an element of the weyl group , something which is not a tableau of type @xmath15 .",
    "this leads us to the notion of admissibility for a standard tableau of type @xmath15 , the precise definition being that its truncated orbit must contain only standard tableaux of type @xmath15 .",
    "examples are given for several choices of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "representations of @xmath4 are constructed in section [ sec - rep ] with the help of standard tableaux of type @xmath15 .",
    "the representations are parametrised by admissible truncated orbits and the representation spaces have a basis indexed by the elements of a given admissible truncated orbits ( by admissibility , these are standard tableaux of type @xmath15 ) .",
    "the action of the generators is given explicitly ( in a ",
    "seminormal \" form ) and the representations are irreducible and calibrated .    as a corollary of the construction of representations associated to admissible truncated orbits , we obtain a complete description of the calibrated spectrum of @xmath4 . roughly speaking",
    ", the calibrated spectrum is the set of characters of the commutative subalgebra of @xmath4 which support a calibrated representation .",
    "the result is that the calibrated spectrum of type @xmath15 is in bijection with the set of admissible standard tableaux of type @xmath15 . in a sense , this sums up the interpretation of these combinatorial objects in terms of representation theory .",
    "it is immediate to determine which representations pass to the quotient and become irreducible calibrated representations of @xmath9 .",
    "this property is seen directly on the standard tableaux .",
    "a description of the calibrated spectrum of the quotient algebra @xmath9 also follows immediately from its description as a quotient of @xmath4 by a central element , together with general considerations on the calibrated spectrum of a quotient affine hecke algebra .",
    "it is described as a subset of the set of admissible standard tableaux of type @xmath15 , namely those satisfying a condition on their contents given explicitly , and related to the expression of the fundamental weight corresponding to @xmath3 in terms of simple roots .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ] * 6 . *",
    "+ + + +    let us make connections with the classical situation of @xmath0 . among the algebras @xmath4 ,",
    "the affine hecke algebra of @xmath0 appears when one takes @xmath16 and @xmath3 an extremity of the dynkin diagram . in this case",
    ", the @xmath5-module @xmath6 is the usual free @xmath5-module with basis @xmath17 equipped with the permutation action of the symmetric group ( the simple roots are @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the basis vector added to the root lattice ) .",
    "the distinguished invariant is @xmath20 and the quotient algebra @xmath9 is the affine hecke algebra associated to the weight lattice ( that is , associated to @xmath21 ) .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "our notion of tableaux of type @xmath15 coincides evidently with the usual notion of young tableaux associated to skew shapes .",
    "the truncated action in this case is defined as follows .",
    "consider the simple transposition exchanging @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then its action on a given standard tableau is  killed \" if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are adjacent .",
    "a fact underlying the representation theory of the symmetric group is that this process respects the braid relations , a result that we generalise to any type @xmath15 .",
    "we check that , with our definitions , a truncated orbit for @xmath0 contains all standard tableaux of a given skew shape .",
    "moreover , here any standard tableau is obviously admissible . to sum up , our construction recovers , for @xmath0 , the constructions of @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the general result concerning the quotients @xmath9 becomes that the representations passing to the affine hecke algebra of @xmath21 are those corresponding to shapes such that the product of the contents of all boxes is equal to 1 .    from the point of view of representation theory , the notion of being of the same shape for two standard tableaux is replaced , for a general type @xmath15 , by the notion of belonging to the same truncated orbit . in this sense ,",
    "the ( admissible ) truncated orbits replace the usual skew shapes .",
    "we note that the notion of shape is not relevant anymore since the boxes can move under the action of the weyl group .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of the truncated action which was used to define the truncated orbits , and whose properties ultimately rely on the fact that the braid relations are preserved .",
    "furthermore , the truncated action is necessary to define the notion of admissibility which could not have been defined using the full action of the weyl group .",
    "we note that the notion of admissibility was not present ( or , more precisely , is trivial ) in the classical @xmath0 situation .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ] * 7 . *",
    "+ + + +    finally , in a last part ( section [ sec - res - lim ] ) , the restriction to finite hecke algebras ( of type ade ) is considered .",
    "the representations , indexed by admissible truncated orbits , are already constructed .",
    "we also obtain representations of weyl groups ( of type ade ) by a limiting procedure in the formulas for the action of the generators .",
    "we consider the obtained representations as analogues of the skew representations of the symmetric group and of the finite hecke algebra of type a. we note that , corresponding to a given type @xmath2 , we obtain several different families of combinatorial constructions ( depending of the vertex @xmath3 ) .",
    "the obtained representations of finite hecke algebras and weyl groups are not irreducible in general .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain a sufficient condition for these representations to be irreducible , which is expressed combinatorially in terms of tableaux .",
    "we name this property as  to be of level 1 \" since it corresponds to considering representations which pass to a certain  cyclotomic \" quotient of level 1 .",
    "the term cyclotomic for these quotients , and the ones of higher levels , is motivated by the remark below .    again to clarify the connections with the @xmath0 situation , we note that the cyclotomic quotients ( of any level ) exactly coincide , in the @xmath0 situation , with the well - studied ariki  koike algebras @xcite , also called cyclotomic hecke algebras .",
    "then the property of being of level 1 for a classical tableau is simply that its shape must be a usual partition ( not skew ) .",
    "it is well - known that in this case , the corresponding representations of the finite hecke algebra of type a ( or of the symmetric group ) are irreducible .",
    "this is the property we generalise to any type @xmath15 .",
    "we note that a further property in the @xmath0 situation is that all irreducible representations of the finite hecke algebra are obtained as such level 1 representations , or equivalently , the cyclotomic quotients of level 1 are isomorphic to the finite hecke algebra .",
