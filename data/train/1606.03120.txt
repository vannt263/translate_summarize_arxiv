    "ultracold heteronuclear molecules have attracted considerable attention because of the prospects for utilizing their rich internal structure as a platform for emulating various many - body hamiltonians , conducting fundamental studies in quantum chemistry , and performing precision tests of fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "many of these proposals require the availability of trapped , high phase space density samples of deeply bound ground state molecules .",
    "a successful route to such molecules has been demonstrated by first simultaneously cooling two atomic species to high phase space density , subsequently associating free atom pairs into dimers using heteronuclear field - induced feshbach resonances , and finally de - exciting the resultant molecule using coherent optical multi - photon transitions . to date these methods",
    "have been successfully applied to produce trapped samples of four bi - alkali molecules : @xmath7k@xmath8rb @xcite , @xmath8rb@xmath9cs @xcite , @xmath10na@xmath7k @xcite , and @xmath10na@xmath8rb @xcite .",
    "while the bialkali systems promise to be a fruitful testbed for exploring dipolar quantum phenomena , it is important to expand the field of ultracold diatomic molecules to different classes of heteronuclear species . combining alkali and alkaline - earth - like atomic species offers the new property that the @xmath11 absolute ground state possesses both electric and magnetic permanent dipole moments , which is attractive for applications in quantum simulation and information @xcite .",
    "while cooling to simultaneous quantum degeneracy has been demonstrated in such systems ( yb - li @xcite , sr - rb @xcite , and yb - rb @xcite ) , they inherently suffer from the absence of broad magnetically tunable feshbach resonances in the ground - state @xcite .",
    "such resonances have been verified in an ultracold mixture of ground state alkali li and excited metastable - state alkaline - earth - like yb @xcite , but the inelastic losses appear too large to efficiently utilize them for molecule production .",
    "a viable alternative to the magnetic feshbach resonance has recently been demonstrated using coherent optical raman transfer from free atoms to molecules confined in a three dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the first step towards realizing this approach in the yb - li system is performing spectroscopy of the excited molecular potentials using photoassociation ( pa ) to determine a suitable intermediate state for the raman process .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate and characterize interspecies collisions in a dual - species yb - li magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , and carry out pa spectroscopy of molecular potentials below the yb(@xmath1 ) + li(@xmath2 ) asymptote .",
    "we observe 4 rovibrational states in a comprehensive search from 0 to 250 ghz binding energy and measure pa lineshifts for @xmath3li with different isotopes of yb .",
    "we also describe theoretical ab - initio calculations of the relevant ground and excited state potentials . by using these potentials to analyze our experimental observations ,",
    "we identify the quantum states of the ybli * molecules produced .",
    "several challenges were overcome to demonstrate pa spectroscopy in a dual - species yb - li mot .",
    "first , it is not possible to utilize a dark - spot mot @xcite for either species , a technique that has been very important in earlier mot fluorescence - based heteronuclear pa experiments @xcite . for yb ,",
    "this results from the lack of hyperfine structure in the electronic ground state . in the case of @xmath3li , unlike other alkali atoms , the small ground state hyperfine splitting renders the lower hyperfine state unusable as a true dark state due to off - resonant excitation from the mot cooling light .",
    "second , the large transition linewidth mismatch ( @xmath12 ) complicates simultaneous mot operation with a common magnetic field gradient .",
    "finally , the small reduced mass of ybli results in a large vibrational spacing near dissociation , reducing the number of states with suitably large franck - condon factors .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : experimental - setup ] describes the parameters used in our dual - species mot setup , and characterizes the interspecies interactions in the absence of photoassociation light . in section",
    "[ sec : li2pa ] we discuss the response of our dual yb - li mot system in the vicinity of li@xmath13 photoassociation resonances .",
    "we present our measurements of photoassociative production of ybli * molecules in section [ sec : liybpa ] including isotope shifts of pa lines . in section",
    "v , we discuss the theoretical ab - initio calculations and use it to identify the molecular states observed . we summarize and conclude the paper in section vi .",
    "our dual - species yb - li experimental apparatus is described in @xcite .",
    "since neither species can be operated in a dark mot configuration , we must choose mot parameters for both li and yb that enhance our sensitivity to heteronuclear pa loss , despite the relatively low bright mot densities . towards this end , we choose parameters that create a probe and bath situation for yb and li , respectively .",
    "evolution of yb mot number with ( open triangles ) and without ( inset , open circles ) li mot present ( note different time axes ) .",
    "the solid red lines are fits to the data with the solution to equation ( [ eqn : rateequation1 ] ) with constant li density , as discussed in the text . ]",
    "specifically , the shared magnetic field gradient of @xmath14 g / cm is chosen to optimize li number and density .",
    "for li , the cooling ( repumping ) light parameters for the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) transition are chosen as @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) per beam , where @xmath21 mhz and @xmath22 mw/@xmath23 . to extract the li cloud density using absorption imaging",
    ", we note that the observed in - trap distribution is well fit by a gaussian .",
    "typical atom numbers and cloud sizes are @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 m , and @xmath27 @xmath26 m , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the axial and radial @xmath30 cloud radii , respectively .",
    "the corresponding peak li cloud density is @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "the mot temperature was measured using time - of - flight absorption imaging and found to be @xmath33 mk .    since we operate our yb mot on the relatively narrow ( @xmath34 khz ) @xmath1",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 transition at 556 nm , the yb cloud size at the chosen gradient is considerably smaller than that of li .",
    "furthermore , the loading rate at a gradient of @xmath14 g / cm is much lower than that at our usual operating gradient for yb of 3 g / cm , resulting in a reduced steady state mot number .",
    "the mot light parameters used for yb are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 mw/@xmath23 , yielding typical numbers and sizes of @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath26 m , and @xmath42 @xmath26 m .",
    "the resulting peak yb density is @xmath43 @xmath32 and temperature @xmath44 @xmath26k .",
    "the procedure for ensuring optimal overlap of the cloud centers is discussed in section [ sec : li2pa ] .",
    "the large mismatch in size and number between the two mots allows us to view yb as a small probe inside of a larger li bath .",
    "in fact , when operating the dual - species mot , the li cloud number and size is unchanged , while the steady state yb number falls by roughly a factor of 3 due to inelastic li - yb collisions in the trap . in order to quantify the interspecies collisions , we examine the following rate equations @xmath45 where @xmath46 = yb(li ) and @xmath47 = li(yb ) for the yb(li ) rate equation , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are homonuclear and heteronuclear two - body inelastic loss rate coefficients , respectively , and @xmath50 is the spatially dependent loading rate .",
    "the dual - species mot inelastic dynamics measurements are presented in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . to extract the interspecies loss rate coefficient , @xmath49 , we map the density evolution from equilibrium of yb with and without li present after a quench of the yb mot loading rate , @xmath51 , where we block the yb atomic beam with a mechanical shutter at time @xmath52 .",
    "we continuously measure the density of yb by collecting the mot fluorescence on a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and assuming a constant density profile over the full timescale of decay .",
    "this assumption is justified as the yb cloud widths do not change when the atom number falls by a factor of 3 due to the presence li .",
    "the conversion of pmt voltage to atom number is calibrated using absorption imaging . by integrating equation ( [ eqn : rateequation1 ] ) for @xmath53 over space",
    "we can relate our measurement of atom number decay @xmath54 to density evolution .",
    "we first extract the single species coefficients for yb in equation ( [ eqn : rateequation1 ] ) from the decay in the absence of li , and then fix these parameters in the fit with li .",
    "the red solid line in figure [ fig : fig1 ] is a fit to the solution of equation ( [ eqn : rateequation1 ] ) , yielding the values @xmath55 s@xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58s@xmath56 , where all quoted errors are statistical .",
    "we note that the large initial cloud density and long single body lifetime of @xmath59 seconds allow us to identify both one body and two body loss dominated regimes .    because of the probe - bath nature of our system",
    ", we can replace @xmath60 in the equation for @xmath53 by the time - independent peak li density @xmath61 .",
    "for the data in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , the peak li density is @xmath62 @xmath32 . performing the same functional fit to the data with li ( open triangles in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) with the previously determined parameters fixed",
    ", we obtain an interspecies loss rate coefficient of @xmath63 @xmath58s@xmath56 . because of the large separation of scale between the interspecies and intraspecies inelastic rates for yb ( see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) in equation [ eqn : rateequation1 ] ,",
    "the dynamics in the presence of li become those of one - body loss with time constant @xmath64 , and are thus independent of the yb cloud shape . indeed ,",
    "if we fit the data in figure [ fig : fig1 ] to the equation @xmath65 , we find the same value for @xmath49 as quoted above .",
    "the above value for @xmath49 is an order of magnitude larger than that measured in other bright - bright dual - species mots @xcite . as we will see in sections",
    "[ sec : li2pa ] and [ sec : liybpa ] , this has important consequences for our measurements at both li@xmath13 and ybli pa resonances .",
    "we perform pa spectroscopy on the dual - species mot by detuning a laser to the red of the li @xmath66",
    "@xmath35 @xmath2 transition at 671 nm .",
    "we are thus sensitive to molecular states in potentials asymptoting to both yb(@xmath67s)+li(@xmath68p ) and li(@xmath68s)+li(@xmath68p ) .",
    "since the homonuclear li(@xmath68s)+li(@xmath68p ) interatomic potential falls off as @xmath69 at large separation , the background from li@xmath13 pa consists of strong , closely spaced resonances @xcite . to combat this background , as well as to mitigate the problems of low densities in the bright - bright dual mot and low franck - condon factors due to the @xmath70 shorter range potential of yb and li",
    ", we use a pa beam with very high intensity .",
    "we derive our pa laser beam from a tapered amplifier ( ta ) system , seeded by a toptica dl100 external cavity diode laser .",
    "the ta output is passed through two identical @xmath71 nm band pass filters with a full width at half maximum of 10 nm in order to eliminate frequency components at the @xmath72 @xmath36 @xmath35 @xmath73 @xmath74 transition in yb at 680 nm . after coupling into a single mode fiber ,",
    "the pa beam has a power of 100 mw before focusing onto the dual mot .",
    "we leverage the small size of the yb cloud inside of the li bath and pass the pa beam through the region of li - yb overlap 8 times at an average waist of 80 @xmath26 m , with a total peak intensity of 6 kw/@xmath23 .",
    "to optimize overlap of the two clouds , we fix the yb mot position and vary the li mot position by slight pointing adjustments to the cooling and repumping beams , while monitoring the fluorescence of the yb mot .",
    "the cloud center can be easily translated across the extent of the yb cloud , and we find that this has no noticeable effect on li density .",
    "we choose the li cloud position that maximizes inelastic collisions in the mot and thus minimizes the yb fluorescence .",
    "this method was checked by monitoring the spatial overlap in fluorescence imaging on 2 independent axes .    for acquisition of pa spectra in the dual - species mot ,",
    "we record fluorescence from the li and yb mots on a photodiode and pmt , respectively , and simultaneously measure the pa laser frequency on a high finesse ws7/1275 wavemeter . for each scan",
    "we sweep the pa laser frequency over a 500 mhz range at 3 mhz , and average over 2 periods .",
    "dual li - yb mot fluorescence spectra near pa resonances in li corresponding to the @xmath75 and @xmath76 vibrational states of the @xmath77 potential .",
    "loss of li ( red ) due to pa is accompanied by reduction of background inelastic loss for yb ( blue ) , leading to strong enhancement of the yb signal . ]    a typical pa spectrum in the vicinity of li@xmath13 pa resonances is shown in figure [ fig : lipalines ] , where we reference the laser frequency to the @xmath78 @xmath35 @xmath2 transition .",
    "the two broad li pa features correspond to the @xmath75 and @xmath76 vibrational states of the @xmath77 excited state potential @xcite . to understand the striking response of the yb mot fluorescence around li pa features , it is useful to examine the spatially integrated rate equation for yb , @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the loading rate in atoms / sec , @xmath81 is the one - body loss term , which now includes loss due to scattering of pa light on the @xmath72 @xmath36 @xmath35 @xmath73 @xmath74 transition , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is written explicitly as a function of pa laser detuning @xmath84 due to li@xmath13 pa resonances . in equation ( [ eqn : rateequation2 ] )",
    "we can neglect the term for two - body yb - yb collisions because the density in the presence of li is much reduced , and the one - body loss term now dominates in the presence of pa light .    in the steady state we have @xmath85 , where we find that away from li@xmath13 pa resonances @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the yb mot number is inversely proportional to the li number , and only begins to saturate to its one - body limited value of @xmath87 for large li loss .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : lipalines ] , a unique feature of this probe - bath system is that the yb signal is greatly enhanced at the positions of li@xmath13 resonances , leading to a detection channel for li@xmath13 pa which increases in signal - to - noise at the location of a resonance .",
    "photoassociation spectra of ybli*. ( a ) dual mot fluorescence spectra of li ( red ) and yb ( blue ) revealing 2 ybli * pa resonances ( positions highlighted in green ) , the stronger of which lies near the center of a broad li@xmath13 pa resonance .",
    "( b ) extracted inelastic loss rate coefficient for pa vs. laser detuning , where peaks correspond to ybli * resonances . ]",
    "we now present our measurements of ybli * pa resonances in the dual - species mot .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3](a ) shows dual mot fluorescence spectra , with 2 ybli * pa resonances visible on top of a broad li@xmath13 pa resonance .",
    "remarkably , even with a 75% reduction of the li bath we achieve a contrast of 40% for the strong resonance at 15.70 ghz detuning .    in order to extract quantitative information about ybli * resonances independent of the pa frequency - dependent li number ,",
    "we express the steady state solution to equation ( [ eqn : rateequation2 ] ) as @xmath88 where we have written @xmath49 as the sum of a constant background inelastic component , @xmath89 , and a pa frequency dependent component , @xmath90",
    ". since we can measure the factor @xmath91 from the equilibrium yb mot number in the absence of li , and because we already know the value of @xmath89 from section [ sec : experimental - setup ] , equation ( [ eqn : betaeqn ] ) gives us a simple method for producing a spectrum of @xmath90 in absolute units ( figure [ fig : fig3](b ) ) .",
    "each of the 4 ybli * pa lines shown in the spectrum in figure [ fig : fig3](b ) has a double peak substructure due to the ground state hyperfine splitting in @xmath3li of 228 mhz .",
    "the peak ybli * molecule production rate observed in our experiment is @xmath92 s@xmath56 , which is comparable to pa experiments in a dark - bright rb - yb dual mot @xcite .",
    "any higher - lying ( more weakly bound ) states are not observed as the fluorescence signal is strongly affected by the proximity to the li atomic resonances .",
    "as these are the only ybli * structures we see in our scan down to 250 ghz detuning , we can conclude that lower - lying ( more deeply bound ) vibrational states have franck - condon factors that are below our experimental sensitivity .",
    "for the two strongest pa lines at 15.70 ghz and 22.39 ghz , we performed a separate test @xcite to verify that our observations correspond to formation of ybli * and not yb*li*. we removed the excited state yb atoms during pa exposure by pulsing the yb mot and pa light 180@xmath93 out of phase with a @xmath94khz square wave . since the yb excited state lifetime is @xmath95s , the observed persistence of the pa features in this situation confirms the production of ybli*.    in order to obtain more information for state assignment to the observed ybli * lines , we change the yb isotope in our dual - species mot and observe the shift in resonance position with changing reduced mass .",
    "the measured spectra at the 15.70 ghz pa line for @xmath5yb , @xmath4yb , and @xmath6yb are shown in figure [ fig : isotopedependence ] .",
    "we find a symmetric shift from the position of the @xmath4ybli * resonance of @xmath96510 mhz for the @xmath5ybli*@xmath97ybli * resonances , respectively .",
    "similarly , at the 22.39 and 20.89 ghz resonances , we find a shift between the different isotopes of 405 and 390 mhz respectively .",
    "the direction of the shift with reduced mass is consistent with an accumulated shift from the most deeply bound to near dissociation molecular states .",
    "ybli * photoassociation for different isotopes of yb .",
    "the line shift is due to the changing reduced mass , while the double peak reflects the ground state hyperfine structure in @xmath3li ( 228 mhz splitting ) . ]",
    "the main purpose of our theoretical study is to provide reliable information about the interaction potentials between yb and li atoms in order to identify and analyze the experimentally - observed photoassociation spectrum of the excited ybli molecule , presented in the previous section .",
    "we are interested in all potentials that dissociate to the limits where both atoms are in their electronic ground state and those where the li atom is in its first - excited @xmath98 state .      despite",
    "the fact that spin - orbit splitting @xmath99 of the @xmath100 states of li is small ( here @xmath101ghz @xcite , where @xmath102 is planck s constant ) a precise description of the binding energy of highly - excited vibrational levels near these dissociation limits ( with an accuracy @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a few mhz ) requires a relativistic hund s case ( c ) description of the long - range excited potentials .",
    "there exist two relativistic potentials with @xmath105 symmetry and one with @xmath106 that dissociate to the li @xmath107 limits .",
    "the quantum number @xmath108 is the absolute value of the projection of the total electron angular momentum @xmath109 along the interatomic axis .",

    "we presented its long - range van der waals coefficient separately in @xcite . here , we will slightly modify the short - range form of the ground - state potential to fit to the experimentally measured scattering length @xcite ( see the discussion at the end of this section ) .    in the valence - bond method electronic wavefunctions @xmath113 , which are the eigenstates of the relativistic many - electron hamiltonian @xmath114 at interatomic separation @xmath115 , are constructed from atomic orbitals of the constituent atoms @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "in essence , the electronic wavefunction is given by @xmath118 , where each @xmath119 is an anti - symmetrized product of atomic determinants @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "the sums @xmath46 and @xmath47 are over all included atomic determinants . the variational ci coefficients @xmath123 are obtained by solving a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem as the basis @xmath119 is not orthogonal .",
    "we use atomic dirac - fock orbitals that are optimized iteratively to accelerate the ci convergence .",
    "this includes alternating between the determination of ci coefficients and the improvement of the atomic orbitals .",
    "our rci - vb method is an _ all - electron _ calculation in which no pseudopotentials are used .",
    "instead the orbitals ( or electrons ) of each atom are divided into two groups : core and valence electrons . here",
    "core electrons occupy the 1@xmath124 , 4@xmath125 closed shells of the yb atom , where the superscript denotes the number of electrons in orbital @xmath126 .",
    "core orbitals do not contribute significantly to the formation of the molecule and excitations out of these shells are not considered .",
    "valence electrons occupy the 5@xmath127 , 5@xmath128 , 5@xmath129 , 4@xmath130 , 4@xmath131 , and 6@xmath127 orbitals for the yb atom and the 1@xmath127 and 2@xmath132 orbitals for li .",
    "the convergence of the ci expansion can only be determined by increasing the number of configurations .",
    "we achieved this by systematically adding atomic orbitals out of which the atomic and thus molecular determinants are constructed .",
    "in particular , we allow single and double excitations from valence shells into virtual , unoccupied orbitals with principal quantum numbers up to @xmath133 for li and @xmath134 for yb , and orbital quantum numbers @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "our observed photoassociation spectrum is localized within 250 ghz of the @xmath2 or d@xmath137 dissociation limit of li .",
    "consequently , we need to pay particular attention to the long - range molecular dispersion potentials . we have performed a separate calculation of the dispersion interaction potential for this excited ybli molecule and have connected it smoothly to the electronic calculations discussed above .",
    "we use degenerate second - order perturbation theory in the anisotropic electric dipole - dipole interaction similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "we start by defining basis states for the two atoms . for li we can first ignore the weak spin - orbit interactions and define non - relativistic states @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are its electron orbital angular momentum and spin , respectively .",
