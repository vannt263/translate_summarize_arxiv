    "lead magnesium niobate pbmg@xmath1nb@xmath2o@xmath3  ( pmn ) is an abo@xmath3-perovskite that exhibits relaxor ferroelectric ( rfe ) properties , such as a broad , frequency sensitive , dielectric permittivity peak at @xmath4 near room temperature.@xcite it was originally suggested that rfe properties are associated with a ",
    "diffuse phase transition \" that reflects a _",
    "random _ spatial distribution of curie temperatures , @xcite originating from chemical inhomogeneities ; however , the implied chemical segregation of mg@xmath5   and nb@xmath6   ions on perovskite b - sites has not been observed .",
    "rather , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) indicates chemical short - range order ( sro ) such that 1:1 ordered domains , 20 - 50   across , are embedded in a disordered matrix .",
    "@xcite thus , the microstructure is characterized by fluctuations of a 1:1 chemical order parameter on the 20 - 50    length scale , and not by compositional fluctuations about mg : nb=1:2 , as previously suggested.@xcite    the  random site model ( rsm ) \" for the ordered domains , @xcite has nacl - type mg / nb ordering with one b - site occupied by nb@xmath6 , and the other by a random mixture of 1/3  nb@xmath6 + 2/3  mg@xmath5 .",
    "note that the phrase  random - site model \" is only used for an idealized model . the phrase ",
    "1:1 phase \" is used for real crystals that presumably have some sro chemical correlations which are deviations from @xmath7   on the mg@xmath5-rich sites .",
    "burns and dacol @xcite observed that the refractive index of pmn departs significantly from a linear temperature dependence below a characteristic temperature , @xmath8   ( burns temperature ) .",
    "they interpreted these data as indicating that polar nanoclusters ( pnc ) condense at @xmath9 ; and @xmath10   is now generally accepted as the crossover between rfe and paraelectric ( pe ) states .",
    "recent tem studies @xcite have attempted to correlate chemical sro with pnc .",
    "chemical sro makes pmn inhomogeneous at a length - scale that affects vibrational mode activities .",
    "mode activities in inhomogeneous media are determined by the range of interatomic forces , typically a few lattice parameters , and they do not depend on the wavelength of the probing radiation . however , the probing radiation wavelength does determine the volume in which the spectroscopic response is averaged .",
    "if , as in pmn , the inhomogeneities are smaller than the wavelength , an effective medium approach is justified .",
    "room - temperature ir reflectivity spectra of pmn single crystals were first published in the 1970s .",
    "@xcite karamyan reported three polar modes , characteristic of cubic perovskites .",
    "burns and dacol , however , reported many more modes , which they explained as  two - mode behavior\".@xcite subsequent studies of pmn ceramics@xcite agreed with karamyan s spectrum , but the resolution was poor .",
    "the interpretation of raman spectra from pmn is also controversial ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the raman spectra of pmn and pst are similar , @xcite and it was assumed that the main features of both reflect @xmath11   symmetry ( locally for pmn ) as in the 1:1 phase . in @xmath11 ,",
    "the raman active modes are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and 2@xmath14 : @xmath12   and @xmath13   modes are observable in parallel ( vv ) geometry ; 2@xmath14   modes are observable in crossed - polarized ( vh ) geometry . polarized raman studies and raman spectral intensities support tem results in suggesting that pmn has 1:1 chemical sro in a disordered matrix .",
    "the objectives of this study are : ( 1 ) to perform a comparative supercell stability analyses in pmn , including symmetry - breaking relaxations [ _ i.e. _ finding ground states ( gs ) with symmetries that are lower than those dictated by chemical ordering ] .",
    "( 2 ) to compute the lattice dynamics for the same set of ordered pmn supercells , and to compare the results with experimental data , _",
    "e.g. _ by comparing simulated ir reflectivity spectra with the experimental one .",
    "the goal is to find which ordered supercell most closely approximates the experimental case of local 1:1 order .",
    "ir and thz measurements were performed on a pmn single crystal , down to liquid helium temperatures , where all polar modes are well distinguished .",
    "a disk of 9  mm diameter and 3  mm thickness was cut from a pmn single crystal , and polished for specular ir reflectivity measurements .",
    "a time - domain thz spectrometer was used to determine the complex dielectric response @xmath15 in the submillimeter and near - millimeter ranges .",
    "this spectrometer uses femtosecond laser pulses to generate thz radiation via optical rectification on a znte single crystal , with an electro - optic sampling detection technique .",
    "low - temperature spectra were taken in transmission configuration from 100 - 900 ghz , where the thin ( 100 @xmath16 m thick ) plane - parallel plate was semi - transparent . room temperature dielectric response up to 2.5 thz was calculated from the thz reflectance data .",
    "@xcite the unpolarized near - normal reflectivity spectra were taken with a fourier transform ir ( ftir ) spectrometer bruker ifs 113v at @xmath17   in the spectral range 20 - 650 @xmath18 ; room - temperature spectra were measured up to 4000 @xmath18 .",
    "ir reflectivity spectra were fitted together with complex dielectric thz spectra using a generalized - oscillator model with the factorized form of the complex dielectric function :    @xmath19    where the dielectric function is related to reflectivity r(@xmath20 ) by @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the transverse optic and longitudinal optic ( lo ) frequency of the _ j_-th mode , respectively ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 the corresponding damping constants .",
    "the high - frequency ( electronic ) permittivity @xmath26 was obtained from the frequency - independent 300k reflectivity above the phonon frequencies . the temperature dependence of @xmath26 is usually very small and was neglected in our fits .",
    "the to1 mode was fit to the more accurate ftir reflectivity .",
    "below 30  @xmath18 , the thz data are more accurate than the ftir data , so it was given greater weight in the fit .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ irmodes ] .",
    "in particular , the to1 phonon frequency shifts from 88  @xmath18   at 20  k down to 54 @xmath18   at 300 k. therefore we can call it soft mode ( sm ) .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ poscar30 ]      the ir reflectivity spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ reflectivity ] , and compared with our experiment .",
    "it is seen that the best agreement between the theory and experiment is for [ 111]@xmath27   structure .",
    "the complex dielectric spectra in the phonon frequency range are plotted in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] together with experimental data obtained .",
    "we have qualitative agreement for high frequencies . at low frequencies",
    ", experiment shows very high values of permittivity connected with relaxations of pnc .",
    "these frequencies are below phonon s .",
    "relaxation contributions to dielectric permittivity were not included into our theoretical consideration ( we discussed these problems in a previous publication @xcite ) .",
    "notice different scales in the experimental and theoretical plots .",
    "the total zone - center phonon density of states of the [ 111]@xmath28 and [ 111]@xmath27 structures are shown in fig",
    ".  [ density ] .",
    "it is seen from this plot that the high energy phonon band is not very dispersive compared to the low frequency bands and compared to the bands known for abo@xmath3   perovskites .",
    "this can be explained by folding the bands due to ordering of mg and nb .",
    "mode assignments were then made at several levels of approximation by averaging the [ 111]@xmath27 dm.@xcite the lowest - frequency modes of the supercell are related to the folded acoustic modes of the parent 5-atom cell : excluding zero frequency zone center acoustic modes , eigenvectors of the low - frequency modes in the frequency interval 19 - 100 @xmath18   are significant only on pb .",
    "this corresponds to extremely low - frequency acoustic antiphase pb displacements , which arise due to a very small diagonal element of dm for pb .",
    "next , to understand how local 1:1 order may affect the phonon properties , the [ 111]@xmath27   dynamical matrix was averaged with respect to a 1:1 ordered structure . the [ 111]@xmath27 structure is the only one studied which is commensurate with such averaging . effectively , the [ 111]@xmath29 layers were treated as though they contained only one average t - cation , t=(mg@xmath2nb@xmath1 ) .",
    "symmetry analysis of [ 111]@xmath27   in @xmath11 , yields the following modes : @xmath30 . here ,",
    "@xmath31   and @xmath32   indicate ir- and raman - active modes respectively , and @xmath33   indicates silent . computed eigenvectors of the [ 111]@xmath27 @xmath34 structure were projected onto vectors of the averaged computation to obtain the modes expected to have the highest infrared and raman activity .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , and compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering,@xcite raman scattering and fir reflectivity measurements ( this study ) .",
    "polar to modes [ @xmath35 are labeled to1 , to2 , to3 , and to4 .",
    "the relative contributions from pb , t , nb , o@xmath36 , and o@xmath37   in the to1 mode ( 100 @xmath18 ) are : -0.16 , 0.21 , 0.27 , 0.32 , and 0.41  ; where : o@xmath38   is displaced along b - o bonds ; o@xmath39   is displaced perpendicular to b - o bonds .",
    "the to2 mode at 270 @xmath18 , is predominately of the slater type .",
    "neutron @xcite and our ir measurements ( table i ) exhibit bands near this frequency .",
    "the to3 mode near 340 @xmath18   is from nb moving opposite to t. experimental evidences for this band is not definitive , although a mode is found near this frequency in the fit to room - temperature ir data .",
    "the to4 mode near 580 @xmath18   originates from o@xmath38-(t , nb ) stretching , and it is clearly observed in the ir and neutron data .    in first - order raman scattering from @xmath11 crystals , @xmath12 and @xmath13 modes should be visible in vv geometry , while @xmath14 modes should be visible in vh geometry .",
    "the calculated @xmath12   raman active mode at 810 @xmath18   matches quite well the intense peak that is observed experimentally at 780 @xmath18 in vv spectra . in [ 111]@xmath27   @xmath11",
    ", this mode corresponds to a fully symmetrical , ir inactive , o - breathing mode .",
    "the calculated raman active @xmath13 asymmetrical breathing mode near 590 @xmath18 is broadened due to local symmetry breaking , and corresponds with experimentally observed bands at 500 and 600 @xmath18 . in all cases",
    ", we had some frequency intervals ( and even a multipeak structures ) when projecting the modes obtained for gss onto the modes derived from symmetrized dm .",
    "the calculated raman active @xmath40   mode near 360 @xmath18   involves mostly symmetrical o@xmath39   displacements .",
    "a wide envelope of the bands is seen in our raman experiment at this frequency .",
    "the calculated low - frequency @xmath14 raman mode near 80 @xmath18 is mostly from pb - displacements . in the vh spectrum ,",
    "the low - frequency band is a doublet ( 45 and 62 @xmath18 ) .",
    "both components are close to the zone - boundary frequency of the ta branch ( 50 @xmath18 ) according to neutron scattering data @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ comparison ] ) .    experimentally , there are strong raman peaks near 150 @xmath18 and 250 @xmath18 .",
    "these peaks probably arise from local symmetry breaking ( octahedral tilting and/or polar distortions ) , and not from nb - t ordering .",
    "all the pmn supercells studied here ( fig . [ structures ] ) are unstable with respect to lower energy structurally stable states , i.e @xmath41 .",
    "relaxation energies , @xmath42 , are large relative to the thermal vibrational energy , which suggests that local @xmath43   symmetry breaking should persist to high temperatures , generating local strain fields .",
    "some instabilities , however , have barriers of the order of thermal energy , especially last - type modes corresponding to pb - bo@xmath44   stretching vibrations in finite - size chemically ordered regions .",
    "the softest vibrations are exhibited by pb - ions that are coordinated by a highly symmetric array of mg- and nb - ions , or pb - ions surrounded by nb - ions only .",
    "such pb - ions have diagonal pb - frequencies ( the ratio of the spring constant and mass ) of only @xmath45 @xmath18 .    of the supercells studied here , [ 111]@xmath27 , in @xmath46 ,",
    "has the lowest energy , and with respect to chemical sro , it is the best approximate of the rsm .",
    "this suggests that it is also a good approximate for chemically ordered domains in a pmn crystal with @xmath47   global symmetry .",
    "egami@xcite and naberezhnov _ et al _ @xcite reported that the local ferroelectric instability in pmn below burns temperature is associated with pb - displacements in opposition to the other ions and this is essentially what occurs in the [ 111]@xmath27   last - mode dominated fe instability , @xmath48 .",
    "note , however , that last - type instabilities occur in all five supercells . computed distributions of the interatomic distances in the 30-ion supercells",
    "show that pb - o distances split into two main groups at 2.5   and 3.2   , in agreement with experiment.@xcite    computed dynamical charges in pmn are not as large as is typical for simple abo@xmath3 perovskites@xcite : the nb charge varies from 6.0 to 9.1 .",
    "an fe - active ion that is surrounded by less fe - active ions , e.g. nb surrounded by mg , typically has a reduced dynamical charge , e.g. relative to nb surrounded by nb ; and the dynamical charge of the less fe - active ion increases ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this happens because charge transfer is reduced when an ion of relatively low electronegativity is surrounded by ions with higher electronegativities .",
    "@xcite    computed phonons for all the structures shown in fig .",
    "[ reflectivity ] exhibit three similar features : ( 1 ) b - o - b stretching modes at 500 - 900  @xmath18 ; ( 2 ) mixed b - o - b bending and o - b - o stretching modes at 150 - 500  @xmath18 ; ( 3 ) pb - bo@xmath44   stretching modes at @xmath49  150  @xmath18 .",
    "differences between the computed ir spectra for different supercells ( fig .",
    "[ reflectivity ] ) are purely quantitative , not qualitative .",
    "the [ 111]@xmath27   spectrum is most similar to the experimental one : the 500 - 900  @xmath18   band is relatively narrow , as in the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ reflectivity ] ) ; but the other computed bands are less intense than their experimental counterparts .",
    "this is an artifact of using the same damping constant for all computed modes ( 60 @xmath18   is an average of the experimental values ) .",
    "the 60 @xmath18   damping constant , which we used in our computation , is significantly larger than the usual value for pure perovskites , @xmath5020 @xmath18 .",
    "a large value for disordered pmn is expected because the random fields caused by chemical disorder broaden the phonon density of states .",
    "experimentally , however ( c.f . sec .",
    "[ ir ] ) , some modes exhibited extremely small damping constants , which implies sharper features in the reflectivity spectrum .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] that the number and distribution of the modes in @xmath51   group over frequencies are much richer than in @xmath52   geometry .",
    "for example , the single @xmath12   peak in @xmath52   group can be connected with three @xmath53   modes in @xmath51   group ( 857 , 800 , and 759 @xmath18 ) , in agreement with raman spectra .",
    "the distribution of the frequencies of these peaks in @xmath51   group is due to differences in frequencies for oxygen ions in different wyckoff positions : the stretching vibrations of the oxygen ions in nb - o - nb- chains are harder than other oxygen stretching vibrations , due to ferroelectric instability in these chains ( combined with nearest pb ions ) and a large shift of oxygen ions in the equilibrium state ( see table [ diag30 ] ) .",
    "there is also a difference between ionic vibrations in mg - o - nb bridges and in nb@xmath54o@xmath54   squares in @xmath55   plane .",
    "ideally , @xmath56   modes should be seen only in vv geometry .",
    "the presence of some intensity in vh geometry can be regarded to local fields and distortions .",
    "notice the existence of an ir active mode ( 704 @xmath18 ) in the same frequency interval which is due to a large ( minimal ) size of the supercell in comparison with the unit cell at @xmath52   symmetry .    at the frequency of @xmath13   mode of @xmath52   group",
    ", there are several raman active symmetrical breathing @xmath53   ( 663 , 601 , and 534 @xmath18 ) and one antisymmetrical breathing ( 599 @xmath18 ) modes .",
    "the splitting and the absence of large intensity in vh geometry in experimentally measured spectra in this frequency interval testifies against @xmath13   mode in @xmath52   group but agrees quite well with the computed splitting in @xmath51   group and with @xmath53   symmetry of three of the four modes . in the same frequency interval",
    "there is a wide distribution of ir active modes that well corresponds to the wide peak in the fir spectrum ( to4 mode in terms of @xmath52   symmetry ) .",
    "the @xmath11   group assignment can hardly explain the presence of a peak in raman and ir spectra at a frequency a little bit higher than 400 @xmath18 .",
    "the computation within @xmath51   symmetry does give both raman active ( @xmath53 , 443 , and @xmath57 , 423 @xmath18 ) modes as well as ir active modes ( 412 , 418 @xmath18 ) .",
    "the position of @xmath40   mode in @xmath52   group is noticeably higher than the position of the intensive peak in raman spectrum in vh geometry .",
    "the @xmath51   group gives a few suitable modes in the right place and gives a wide distribution of these modes over frequencies that corresponds to a large width of the raman lines observed .",
    "however , at the present time , we can not prove that the peak of the raman intensity in the computation corresponds to the peak in the experiment , because we did not compute the intensities .",
    "finally , we want to notice that there are a few low frequency modes spread over the frequency interval 25 - 96  @xmath18 ( below the frequency of the soft mode ) which are raman and ir active .",
    "these modes appear because of comparatively low symmetry of the supercell .",
    "all they are in the range of the acoustic modes in the reduced ( 5-ions ) unit cell and are connected with antiphase pb displacements .",
    "taken together , the first principles results , and experimental data from neutron scattering,@xcite raman , and ir reflectivity enables assignments of specific vibrational modes to experimental phonon peaks .",
    "following akbas and davies @xcite pmn is approximated as the rsm .",
    "positions of ir - active , raman - active and silent modes , were calculated , and distribution functions for all these modes have finite width , and some are split .",
    "there are a few low frequency modes in the range 25 - 96  @xmath18 ( below the frequency of the soft mode ) which are both raman and ir active .",
    "they reflect antiphase pb - displacements @xcite that are allowed by the low supercell symmetry , and are all in the acoustic - mode range for the reduced ( 5-ion ) unit cell .",
    "we studied five ordered supercells of pmn .",
    "instabilities involving pb off - centering are observed in all supercells and instabilities involving the tilting of o octahedra centered on mg ions are observed in most .",
    "when fully relaxed , the [ 111]@xmath27   structure described here has the lowest known first - principles energy for an ordered pmn structure .",
    "it is commensurate with the random site model ( rsm ) of pmn@xcite , and has short - range mg - nb correlations that are most comparable to the rsm .",
    "its raman and ir spectra and pair distribution functions are in qualitative agreement with experiment , allowing mode assignment of the dominant features of the spectra . in its lowest - energy state ,",
    "it is polarized in approximately along an @xmath58 $ ] type direction , yielding pseudomonoclinic symmetry .",
    "unphysical aspects of this perfectly ordered [ 111]@xmath27   supercell as an approximant for the 1:1 ordered regions in experimental pmn , include the lack of a disordered matrix , the fact that there is no experimental evidence for ordering on the mg@xmath2nb@xmath1 sublattice , and the presence of infinite nb - o - nb ... chains ( which influence the lattice dynamics ) .",
