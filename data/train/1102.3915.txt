    "molecular transitions in the millimeter and submillimeter bands are well suited to characterize the physical conditions of dense gas in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or starburst ( sb ) regions .",
    "starburst regions are associated with far - uv emission from o and b stars and corresponding photon - dominated regions ( pdrs , @xcite , which characterize cloud surfaces ) , while accretion onto an agn creates an x - ray dominated region ( xdr , @xcite , which characterize cloud volumes ) .",
    "these two different types of regions can be distinguished by the signatures of the molecular gas chemistry ; making such a distinction has been the focus of recent research in many ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies or ( u)lirgs . however , we often must understand the physical environment of the dense gas before we can properly diagnose the xdr or pdr nature of it .",
    "for example , the predicted line ratios for xdr or pdr scenarios vary with density .",
    "therefore it is important to understand the physical conditions of the gas before using ( sub)millimeter lines to provide key information about the dominant energy source heating the gas .",
    "ngc 1068 ( m77 ) is often cited as the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ; it is a barred spiral hosting an agn that has been extensively studied at many wavelengths . at a redshift of 1137 @xmath5  @xcite , 1@xmath6  @xmath7 78 pc assuming h@xmath8 @xmath5  mpc@xmath9 . with an infrared luminosity of @xmath10 l@xmath11 ,",
    "it is classified as a lirg @xcite .",
    "the major features of ngc 1068 are the large star - forming arms , a central circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) , and a jet emerging in the northeast direction from the cnd .",
    "the star - forming arms , seen most prominently in co line emission , essentially form a large ring of 30@xmath6  diameter ( about 2.3 kpc , figure 2 of @xcite , figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the cnd is approximately 4@xmath6  diameter ( 312 pc ) , from which arises emission of molecular high - density gas tracers ( e.g. , cs , hco@xmath0 , hcn , hnc ) , as can be seen in many maps ( such as @xcite and the 1 mm and 3 mm continuum maps of @xcite ) .",
    "the cnd itself can be resolved into two knots ( east and west ) with different velocity profiles @xcite .",
    "the geometry of ngc 1068 is a significant consideration for single - dish observations , because the two very different regions ( the cnd and sf ring ) are blended by most ( sub)millimeter telescope beams .",
    "for example , for our @xmath12 30@xmath6  beam , we are measuring some emission from the sf ring on the outer edges of our beam , and also emission from the central cnd concentrated in the middle . in the case of co ( and the continuum )",
    "we are measuring both components .",
    "for the high - density tracing molecules , however , the emission is concentrated only in the center of our beam ( from the cnd ) , as can be seen in the aforementioned interferometric maps .",
    "the physical area that we are modeling for this paper is the cnd only ; we address how we correct for possible contamination from the starburst ring in  [ sec : fsb ] .",
    "the black hole mass at the center of the cnd , as inferred from water maser emission , is @xmath13 m@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy ( ring + cnd , @xmath14 l@xmath11 ) is determined mainly by the mid - ir ; about half of this emission comes from the starforming ring , so the bolometric luminosity of the central 4@xmath6  in diameter has been estimated as @xmath15 l@xmath11@xcite . though this is the luminosity visible to us from the cnd , the agn itself has a higher intrinsic luminosity that is well shielded by its obscuring torus . using [ oiv ] 26 @xmath16 m as a calibrator , @xcite",
    "infer an intrinsic ( but highly obscured ) agn luminosity of @xmath17 l@xmath11 , consistent with the estimation of @xcite ( @xmath18 l@xmath11 ) based on l@xmath19 l@xmath20 .",
    "the high amount of the agn s luminosity that is absorbed indicates that the agn can be extremely important in powering the cnd emission .",
    "several recent studies indicate that the cnd of ngc 1068 is an xdr @xcite .",
    "there are a variety of diagnostics of xdr / pdr environments that can be utilized with millimeter - range molecular transitions .",
    "agn tend to have lower intensity ratios of hco@xmath0/hcn ( @xmath21 ) and higher ratios of hcn / co ( @xmath21 , @xcite ) .",
    "hco@xmath0  [ ( @xmath22)/(@xmath21 ) ] , hcn [ ( @xmath23)/(@xmath21 ) ] , and hcn [ ( @xmath22)/(@xmath21 ) ] intensity ratios also appear lower in agn than in sb .",
    "in krips study of 12 nearby galaxies with varying degrees of agn / starburst activity , ngc 1068 was the most characteristic of agn line ratios ( and generally appearing completely opposite from m82 , a prototypical starburst galaxy ) .",
    "furthermore , it is predicted that cn is more abundant than hcn in xdr scenarios due to dissociation ( hcn @xmath24 h + cn , but then cn is particularly robust to further dissociation , @xcite ) .    by observing ngc 1068 with z - spec , a broadband millimeter - wave spectrometer , we are able to measure the continuum simultaneously with multiple molecular transitions .",
    "we present observations of hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc which complement the current literature as well as new transitions of cs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the z - spec instrument , our observing procedure , and the spectrum are described in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "we use the measurements in our spectrum in conjunction with data from the literature to model first the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the cnd of ngc 1068 using radex @xcite .",
    "the modeling procedure is described in  [ sec : analysis ] , with discussion of the results beginning in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we next use the derived molecular abundances and the line ratios within z - spec s band to demonstrate the xdr nature of the cnd in  [ sec : diagnostics ] , followed by conclusions in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we first describe the z - spec instrument and observations of ngc 1068 .",
    "we then present our spectrum along with a description of our spectral fitting procedure and a short discussion of the fit results .",
    "z - spec is a broadband ( 190 - 307 ghz ) millimeter - wave grating spectrometer which we have used at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "its large bandwidth allows simultaneous observations of multiple molecular rotational transitions along with the underlying continuum .",
    "the detector array is composed of 160 silicon - nitride micromesh bolometers cooled to 60 mk by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( adr ) and a closed - cycle @xmath25he refrigerator .",
    "z - spec s compact design is acheived via a wafirs ( waveguide far ir spectrometer ) design utilizing a parallel - plate waveguide and curved rowland diffraction grating @xcite .",
    "z - spec s spectral resolution is approximately 900 mhz at the band center , but varies from 500 mhz ( 700 @xmath5 ) at the low frequency end to 1300 mhz ( 1200 @xmath5 ) at the high frequency end of the band . to minimize susceptibility to atmospheric fluctuations and to subtract sky background emission , we use a chop - and - nod mode . for ngc",
    "1068 observations , our nod interval was 20 seconds , and the chop frequency was 0.95 hz with a throw of 90@xmath6 .",
    "more details about the instrument can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc 1068 over three nights in late january 2007 for a total of 4.21 hours of integration time ( including chopping / nodding , meaning one half of this time was on source ) . on january 24 and 28 , the optical depth at 225 ghz , @xmath26 was steadily @xmath12 0.05 , while on january 27 it was slightly worse at @xmath26  @xmath27 0.070 - 0.086 .",
    "the median sensitivity ( channel uncertainty times square root of integration time ) was 1.13 jy s@xmath28 , some two to three times greater than we typically achieve in observations of faint sources .",
    "we attribute the excess to systematic effects due to the bright source .",
    "z - spec s calibration relies on using a set of planetary observations with varying observing conditions ( bolometer loading and bath temperature ) and fitting the dependence of each individual bolometer s response on its operating voltage , as described in @xcite .",
    "because our observations of ngc 1068 were conducted before the calibration curves described in the aforementioned paper , it was more appropriate to calibrate these observations with local - time observations of uranus . the total integrated continuum flux measured with the bradford and uranus calibrations",

    "@xcite measured the continuum emission from the core and jet of ngc 1068 ; at 230 ghz , the measured continuum flux from this region is only @xmath39 of our measured continuum .",
    "therefore , the continuum measured by our beam is dominated by the starburst ring , but a small contribution is also present from the central disk and jet .",
    "we add their  core + jet \" model ( their figure 3 , top panel ) to the ( beam - scaled ) 34 k greybody of the starburst ring measured by @xcite , so that our continuum fit becomes :    @xmath40    the first term is the beam - scaled greybody , and @xmath41 is the source size in steradians ; we estimate @xmath41 to be approximately @xmath42 sr , based on the 30@xmath6  diameter of the starburst ring . since the emission from the ring actually only occupies a portion of this total area , this is likely an overestimation that can be accounted for with the free parameter a. @xmath43 is a blackbody of dust temperature @xmath44 k , and we take @xmath45 ghz ( which corresponds to @xmath46 m ) and @xmath47 for the dust emissivity spectral index @xcite .",
    "the second term is the power - law contribution from the disk and jet , where @xmath48 is the measured flux at 230 ghz and @xmath49 is the measured power - law scaling .",
    "we use @xmath50 jy and @xmath51 from @xcite .",
    "a and b are the free parameters in our fit ; b is meant to represent the beam - scaling , because our beamsize changes with frequency and thus our coupling with the starburst ring will also change .",
    "b would be expected to be 0 for a beam - filling source and 2 for a point - source .",
    "we note that at these frequencies , the beam - scaled greybody ( first term ) approximates to a powerlaw , where    @xmath52    this means that our best - fit a value is really degenerate with @xmath41 and @xmath53 , and b is degenerate with @xmath54 .",
    "our best - fit model yields @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "our goal with this model is to determine the best - fit continuum in order to measure the line fluxes accurately , not necessarily to properly model the physical conditions of the continuum .",

    "for example , if we were to assume @xmath57 , the difference would be made up in the parameter b. a is much less than 1 likely because the dust continuum emission does not entirely fill the beam ( geometrically ) , and the gas emitting the continuum likely has some filling factor less than 1 .",
    "we would still expect @xmath58 because the changing size of the beam does encompass a varying amount of the starburst ring with frequency ( i.e. we expect a frequency dependence for the relative fraction of coupling to the ring ) .",
    "finally , we note that the core / jet emission makes only a small contribution to the overall continuum , but it does affect the shape of the continuum and especially improves our fit at the higher end of our band ; without it , we would likely overestimate the cs @xmath59  flux by over 10% . in summary",
    ", this model adequately fits our continuum spectrum with reasonable physical parameters .",
    "the resulting measurements are given in table [ table : fit ] .",
    "this fit had a reduced @xmath60 of 5.1 with 140 degrees of freedom .",
    "as can be seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : spectrum ] , a large percentage of the total @xmath60 comes from the co line , which is not well fit by a single - component gaussian .",
    "we do not have the resolution to be able to better model this line , whether its assymetry is due to kinematic structure or blending of other lines .",
    "if we exclude the bins containing the co line , the total @xmath60 is @xmath61 3 .",
    "however , we do not use co in our radiative transfer analysis , so its poor fit is not problematic for the rest of our results .",
    "our fit includes one unidentified spectral feature at a rest frequency of approximately 290 ghz .",
    "this frequency may correspond to ch@xmath62cch @xmath63  or h@xmath2co @xmath64 , but we can not identify other features of these molecules that might be in our band .",
    "likely , this feature is a combination of emission features that we can not resolve , and is therefore left as unidentified .",
    "though other features may be present at the upper end of the spectrum , the channel - to - channel variation increases significantly above the cs @xmath59  transition due to imperfect atmospheric subtraction , so we do not attempt to define spectral features above this frequency .",
    "sio @xmath65  could possibly be identified in this range , but because we can not identify the two lower - j transitions in our band , we do not fit this feature either . below this frequency range , there are a few other features of note that are not fitted .",
    "the first is a possible 3-sigma feature at approximately 284 ghz ; given our inability to know the exact line center and no particularly strong transition expected that at wavelength ( though there are a few transitions of methanol , ch@xmath62oh , around that frequency ) , we do not fit this line . though the same difficulties apply to the unidentified line at 290 ghz , its significance was twice that of this line , and warranted inclusion in the fit .",
    "the apparent features at 200 and 260 ghz are not lines , but part of the continuum model , having been passed through our measured line profiles which included the instrumental sidelobes of the co @xmath23  transition .",
    "future use of z - spec will include modification of the line profiles to exclude these artifacts .",
    "when comparing our fluxes to those previously published , care must be taken to account for different beam sizes because of beam dilution . throughout this paper , we correct for beam dilution by dividing all rayleigh - jeans velocity integrated temperatures by    @xmath66    [ eqn : sizecorr ]    where @xmath67 is the full - width at half maximum of the beam profile and @xmath68 is the fwhm of the source . for all high density tracers ,",
    "we assume a source size of 4@xmath6  ( see discussion on the geometry of ngc 1068 in  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "others have been assuming smaller source sizes such as 1.5@xmath6  @xcite , but we have found that a smaller source size does not significantly change our results for the physical conditions of the cnd .    for the rest of this paper , we will be focusing on high - density tracer emission from the cnd , but first we find it appropriate to comment on the most prominent feature of our spectrum , @xmath69co @xmath23 , mostly from the starburst ring . a source size of",
    "30@xmath6  has been estimated from maps of co emission ( representing the diameter of the starburst ring , see  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "after correction for source size and comparing to the one reported @xmath23  transition from @xcite and three reported @xmath23  transitions from @xcite , z - spec s measured flux is slightly higher than all four others .",
    "however , after adding in a 15% calibration uncertainty to each measurement , they agree within the uncertainties .",
    "this gives us an indication that our calibration is consistent with others .",
    "the transitions useful to the study of the dense nuclear core of ngc 1068 , the subject of the remainder of this paper , are those of hco@xmath38 , hcn , hnc , cn , and cs .",
    "the cs @xmath70  and cs @xmath59  measurements are new , and when combined with previous cs @xmath22 , cs @xmath71 , and cs @xmath65  measurements , provide a well - sampled ladder for radiative transfer modeling .",

    "we sought to estimate the most probable physical conditions of ngc 1068 s dense core by simultaneously modeling a number of molecular lines . rather than just find the single most probable set of conditions , we examined a large parameter space and determined the most probable set of conditions by marginalizing over all possibilites . to do so , we used bayes theorem to describe the likelihood of a particular set of model parameters given our observational measurements , as described in @xcite .",
    "we have extended this analysis to examine multiple molecules at once , as in @xcite . here",
    ", we first describe radex , which is used to create a grid of expected line fluxes for a range of physical parameters , then we detail the likelihood analysis and the specific considerations for ngc 1068 .      to investigate the physical parameters , such as temperature and density , that produced our measured line fluxes , we used radex , a non - lte code freely available from the leiden atomic and molecular database @xcite .",
    "we used the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model to perform statistical equilibrium calculations using the escape probability in an expanding spherical cloud , but the results are insensitive to the precise form of the escape probability . when provided with the proper input data",
    ", radex calculates the level populations in the optically thin limit considering the background radiation field and then calculates the optical depths for the lines .",
    "the code continues calculating new level populations using new optical depth values until the two converge on a consistent solution .",
    "the program then outputs the resulting line intensities as background - subtracted rayleigh - jeans equivalent radiation temperatures",
    ".    the background radiation field can be as simple as a 2.73 k blackbody to represent the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "however , the continuum emission from the cnd should be used as the background if it dominates over the cmb ; using the following procedure , we determined that this is not the case and that the cmb is an adequate background radiation field .",
    "we compared the core continuum measurements of @xcite to the cmb in our frequency range ( 88 to 363 ghz ) .",
    "they measure the continuum emission as a power - law with frequency due to optically thin synchrotron radiation from the central jet source , which is embedded within the cnd but smaller than the full 4@xmath6  diameter .",
    "we use their measured emission sizes at 1 mm and 3 mm to estimate a power - law relating source size to frequency to convert from flux density to specific intensity . however , the property which truly matters to the background radiation field is the mean intensity , which is not equivalent to the specific intensity because the size of the continuum emission is smaller than the full extent of the 4@xmath6  cnd .",
    "therefore , the mean intensity is dependent upon the angular extent of the central source , which is a function of the frequency - dependent size of the source and the distance in the cnd from it .",
    "we use the same relationship between source size and frequency as mentioned above and determine an average angular size of emission throughout the cnd , which we use to calculate the mean intensity .",
    "we find that the mean intensity of the cmb radiation is comparable to that of our core + cmb model , and the difference in the predicted line intensities using either background model ( cmb alone or core + cmb ) is apparent in the radex results only at the lowest temperatures and densities ; the overall likelihood results using grids with or without this background intensity added to the cmb are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "however , we note that future studies using higher - j transition lines may still need to consider this background , which dominates over the cmb above 500 ghz . in summary ,",
    "the cmb + continuum emission is for the most part indistinguishable from the cmb alone , and so we use just the cmb for our background radiation field",

    "such high velocity gradients have been found in studies of the gas in the ngc 253 starburst nucleus @xcite and can arise naturally due to the geometry and kinematics in compact circumnuclear environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in our preferred model , we have only corrected hco@xmath0",

    "the effects of the assumed @xmath147 values are further discussed in the next section .",
    "it is important to note a few systematic effects that exist within our likelihood analysis .",
    "we have assumed that the measurements all have independent gaussian uncertainties .",
    "such a treatment would only be completely valid in the case that the calibrations for each line measurement were independent ; however , the z - spec line fluxes have correlated calibration uncertainties .",
    "additionally , multiple lines come from the iram 30-meter telescope and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , and the lines from each individual telescope have correlated calibration uncertainties . because it would be difficult to assign relative calibration errors to the various line measurements ( they are not reported uniformly ) , we do not attempt to treat the calibration errors as a separate systematic error .",
    "rather , we simply assess the impact of the inclusion of the assumed relative calibration errors in quadrature with the random errors .",
    "doubling the calibration errors results in likelihood distributions that widen ( e.g. by a factor of 1.4 for pressure at the 1-sigma range ) , but the median values change insignificantly .",
    "this indicates that line fluxes determine the molecular level populations and the sizes of the assumed relative calibration errors contribute to the likelihood widths .",
    "( of note , larger calibration errors reduce the jaggedness of the temperature likelihood distribution in figure [ fig : like1 ] .",
    "this implies that the grid point spacing is slightly sparse relative to the measurement uncertainties , but since the mean and overall shape do not change , there are no major consequences for our conclusions . )",
    "we use the linewidth to scale the intensities by first dividing each velocity - integrated intensity by the assumed linewidth to compare directly to the radex predictions of raleigh - jeans temperature for a given column density per unit linewidth .",
    "then , in order to plot the likelihood for the total column density , we multiply column density per unit linewidth by the linewidth .",
    "we assumed the same linewidth ( 240 @xmath5 ) for each molecular line transition based on the co @xmath23  line of @xcite , though there are slight variations by molecular species .",
    "for example , tables 3 of @xcite and 2 of @xcite illustrate the linewidth for some of the molecular transitions used here ; many are broken in multiple components , and some single - component measurements have linewidths as high as 275 @xmath5  ( hcn @xmath22 ) and as low as 166 @xmath5  ( hco@xmath0  @xmath70 ) .",
    "changing the assumed linewidth modifies the likelihood results for the column density .",
    "using a linewidth of 166 instead of 240 @xmath5  reduces median cs column density by 25% , and using a linewidth of 270 instead of 240 @xmath5  increased the median cs column density by less than 1% ( the distributions for the area filling factor shift in the opposite manner from column density in similar proportions ) .",
    "additionally , the supplemental parameter of velocity gradient would be affected by using a different linewidth ( in proportion with that linewidth , i.e. dv / dr would be 30% smaller if the linewidth were 30% smaller ) .",
    "thus , given this range of possible values , the systematic errors due to linewidth assumptions are less than 30% .",
    "the cs abundance was assumed ; this does not affect the relative abundances of the secondary to the primary species , but would affect the conversion to molecular hydrogen . both the total mass in the beam and the velocity gradient depend ( in inverse ways ) on x@xmath250 .",
    "the fact that our estimate for the gas mass agrees with @xcite suggests that the value we have adopted for x@xmath250 is about right .",
    "finally , x@xmath250 is used in the prior probabilities to determine if individual grid points violate the maximum dynamical mass , length , or velocity gradient criteria .",
    "if x@xmath250 is too high / low then more / fewer grid points are allowed .",
    "the main effect of the prior probability is to cut the lowest density and highest column density points from consideration in our analysis .",
    "this analysis necessarily assumes that all the molecular lines trace the same gas .",
    "detailed line profiles indicate that not all lines necessarily trace the same kinematic structures ( i.e. @xcite ) ; however , this analysis is an attempt to examine the bulk properties of the cnd .",
    "we investigated this claim by also examining the likelihood distributions created by modeling individual molecules one at a time .",

    "hcn and cs show similar profiles , and though their best - fit solution requires temperatures of @xmath12 160 and 80 k , respectively , the marginalized distribution also shows a pronounced peak at lower ( @xmath12 10 k ) temperatures . because of these allowed lower - temperature solutions , the density distribution for these two molecules peaks slightly higher than the multi - species model and",
    "is less constrained at the high - density end , though their uncertainties are quite large ; the 1@xmath157 uncertainties for density of hcn and cs span 1.5 and 2.4 orders of magnitude , respectively .",

    "when we model only hnc , hcn , and cs ( excluding hco@xmath0 ) , the results do not change significantly compared to when we include hco@xmath0 , indicating that is not dominating the multi - species likelihood results , but may be tracing a separate component of gas .    though we acknowledge that our treatment of the cnd as one chemical / physical component is a simplifying assumption that is likely not strictly correct",

    "alma will be key to resolving individual components within the cnd .",
    "finally , we note that there are admitted uncertainties in the starburst contribution factors ( @xmath147 ) for our preferred model , which we have only corrected for hco@xmath0  @xmath21 , using @xmath251% .",
    "this correction serves to slightly increase the density while decreasing the temperature and filling factor , though the column density is not significantly changed .",
    "the pressure distribution is only slightly increased ( our model peaks at @xmath252 k @xmath130 , though it would peak at @xmath253 k @xmath130 without the correction ) .",
    "the mass distribution is slightly changed as well , as without the correction it would peak at @xmath254 m@xmath11 , a factor of 2 higher than our model . in total , the hco@xmath0  @xmath21  correction changes the distribution only a small amount relative to the uncertainties . for the other models , we first note that the current values of @xmath147 used are subject to systematic errors in their derivation , because the model is sensitive to both the beam profiles , which may not be purely axisymmetric gaussians , and also to the relative calibration between the telescopes ( which is notoriously difficult ) . for any individual molecule ,",
    "as we increase @xmath147 ( reducing the @xmath21  intensity for hcn , hnc , and hco@xmath0 ) , the best - fit solution s density increases and is less constrained , and the relative likelihood of higher temperature decreases . in general , the filling factor also decreases .",
    "higher @xmath147 scenarios require solutions which peak at the @xmath23  line instead of @xmath21  ( see the middle column of figure [ fig : seds ] ) , which we can not constrain given no @xmath23  measurements .",
    "our slightly lower - density solutions may be a result of uncertainties in @xmath147 , though we have attempted to model the cnd given all the currently available information that we have . in the future ,",
    "when @xmath147 is better constrained through interferometric measurements , our models may require modification that will result in slightly higher - density solutions .",
    "the results of our radiative transfer analysis provide diagnostic information about the energetics of the cnd .",
    "we first present a discussion of our derived relative molecular abundances and how they fit into the context of previous studies of the cnd , especially its xdr nature .",
    "we next present a separate analysis of line ratios specific to the z - spec band , which also supports the xdr scenario .",
    "finally , we speculate on the lifetime of the cnd as determined by the black hole accretion rate and inferred molecular gas reservoir .",
    "some relative abundances of interest are presented in table [ table : abundances ] .",
    "we particularly note the high relative abundance of hcn to hco@xmath0 .",
    "the median values from table [ table : likeresults ] yield [ hcn]/[hco@xmath0 ] of @xmath7 16 .",
    "this is higher than @xcite ( with ratios of 1.3 and 0.6 for the east and west knots , respectively ) but more consistent with @xcite , who required [ hcn]/[hco@xmath0 ] of at least 10 in order to find a solution that matched measured values .",
    "there are three ways to produce such a high abundance .",
    "hcn could be enhanced in a pdr by far - uv radiation from massive star formation .",
    "however , there is no evidence for significant current star formation in the cnd of ngc 1068 . the starburst activity detected by pah emission",
    "likely contributes only 1%  of the total infrared luminosity @xcite and the nuclear starburst is likely 200 - 300 myr old @xcite .",
    "oxygen depletion could also be responsible for decreasing the abundance of hco@xmath0 , hence increasing the hcn / hco@xmath0  ratio .",
    "oxygen underabundance would reduce the formation of co , leaving more carbon for other carbonated species ( e.g. hcn and hnc , @xcite ) . since hco@xmath0  includes both carbon and oxygen , the effects of more available carbon but less available oxygen mean no net change in its abundance .",
    "therefore , this scenario would predict higher hcn / co and hcn / hco@xmath0  ratios .",
    "this scenario was ruled out by @xcite because it predicted a higher ratio of hcn / hco@xmath0  than they found ; however , our ratio ( which agrees with @xcite ) matches better with the prediction from the cited @xcite oxygen depletion model than their cited xdr model .",
    "the same is true for the hcn / co abundance ratio . because their oxygen depletion model is based on different physical conditions than we find here ( @xmath256 @xmath4 , @xmath257 k , @xcite ) , we do not comment on the oxygen depletion scenario based on their models .",
    "the final possibily is an xdr , which at lower densities ( such as those inferred from our analysis , median of @xmath258 ) can explain the hcn / hco@xmath0  ratio .",
    "in addition to the modeled molecular abundances , the measured line intensity ratios also lend evidence towards the xdr scenario , as shown in the following section .",
    "we also found a ratio of column densities n(hnc)/n(hcn ) @xmath259 (   @xmath260 ) , which can be found in xdr environments if the total column density is lower than @xmath261 @xmath130 @xcite , which we infer through our likelihoods that it is .",
    "some other possibilites for the energetics of ngc 1068 have also been considered .",
    "the first two have been ruled out ; @xcite pointed out that cosmic rays accelerated in supernova remnants are generally thought to increase hco@xmath0  and decrease hcn abundances , which is the opposite of what we observe .",
    "ir pumping affects both hco@xmath0  and hcn , which would not explain the high hcn / hco@xmath0  ratio .",
    "however , @xcite found that some xdr results can be explained also by a weak pdr with mechanical heating , and the high abundance of sio may indicate the influence of shocks @xcite .",
    "in addition to radiative transfer and non - lte excitation modeling , the line ratios of high density tracers can themselves be used as diagnostics for xdr environments .",
    "lines within the z - spec band benefit from our common calibration , making the ratios within our band ideal for these diagnostics .",
    "futhermore , even if the lines suffer from contamination from the starburst ring , if that contamination is of a similar amount for the lines we are comparing ( i.e. they have similar values of @xmath147 ) , then their ratio is unaffected .",
    "some of the intensity ratios constructed using z - spec only are shown in table [ table : ratios ] .",
    "though our hco@xmath0/hcn @xmath22  ratio is higher than @xcite ( @xmath262 ) and our hcn / hnc slightly lower than @xcite ( @xmath263 ) , the ratios can not be concluded to be incompatible given the error bars .",

    "intensities for various j lines for these molecules are calculated at each grid point and contours of some line ratios are presented assuming cloud sizes of 1 pc ( see figures 14 - 17 in @xcite ) .",
    "assuming this fixed cloud size means that the column density varies as a function of the density .",
    "the line ratios within the z - spec band are not plotted explicitly in their publication , but the grids are available online such that we could make our own diagnostic plotsmeijerink / grid/ ] .",
    "we constructed 8 line ratios that are unique to z - spec s band , as presented in table [ table : ratios ] , and created contour plots for the xdr and pdr models for each ratio .",
    "we then constructed a chi - squared statistic comparing our ratio to each grid point ; the resulting 2-sigma confidence intervals ( smoothed ) for each of the 8 ratios are presented in figure [ fig : xdrpdr ] .",
    "of the 8 line ratios we present , 6 are consistent with the xdr model at the lower densities inferred by our radiative transfer modeling ( between @xmath269 and @xmath270 @xmath4 ) .",
    "we note that the models do not go below @xmath269 cm@xmath9 , so for those molecules which favor solutions at this density , the parameters should be considered upper limits .",
    "the remaining 2 ratios are either consistent with xdr ( hco@xmath0/hnc @xmath22 ) or pdr ( hco@xmath0/hcn @xmath22 ) at higher densities .",
    "the fact that the two ratios in disagreement with the others contain hco@xmath0  may indicate something about the physical state of this particular molecule ; for example , it may be tracing shock - excited material .",
    "@xcite have found previous evidence of shocks in ngc 1068 using sio , hnco , and methanol ( ch@xmath62oh ) .",
    "our conclusions are similar to the aforementioned paper ; we find some evidence of xdr influence , but also some possible influence of shocks .",
    "the discrepancy of hco@xmath0  may also lend support to the oxygen depletion scenario , because in order to match the xdr models at lower densities , both of these ratios would need to be significantly higher than we measure . if hcn and hnc are being selectively enhanced over hco@xmath0 , that could drive down these ratios , and",
    "hence explain why we see lower values than those predicted by the xdr models at densities of @xmath272 @xmath4 .",
    "if hco@xmath0  is in fact also tracing gas undergoing a different excitation mechanism , we again consider the possibility that it should not be included in the radiative transfer analysis ( as in  [ sec : sys ] ) .",
    "when we exclude this molecule , the density peaks at @xmath273 instead of @xmath258 @xmath4 . even with the slightly larger density , there is no additional support for the pdr model , given the arguments already presented that remain the same even when hco@xmath0  is excluded from the analysis .",
    "however , this is now a second , independent line of evidence ( in addition to the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : sys ] ) that suggests that hco@xmath0  may be tracing a different gas component than other tracers .",
    "this analysis adds support to previous studies that have demonstrated the xdr nature of the cnd of ngc 1068 .",
    "for example , @xcite found support for the xdr model based on relative molecular abundances derived from lvg simulations ( hcn / co , cs / co , hco / hco@xmath0,cn / hcn ) .",
    "@xcite came to the same conclusion based on line ratios of hco@xmath0  @xmath70  with lower j lines and hcn @xmath70 , and by the n(cn)/n(hcn ) @xmath12 1 - 4 column density ratio .",
    "these studies are in addition to the @xcite conclusions in the previous paragraph .",
    "also , @xcite demonstrated that the x - ray irradation in the cnd is adequate for creating an xdr .",
    "the agreement of the majority of our line intensity ratios with the xdr scenario at densities consistent with our radiative transfer modeling results provides strong support for an xdr and also demonstrates the utility of z - spec s broad bandpass and self - consistent line calibration across the band .",
    "we used our derived total gas mass ( @xmath274 m@xmath11 ) to estimate the timescale for accretion onto the central black hole , based on the accretion rate inferred from the agn luminosity .",
    "we use the simple equation    @xmath275    where @xmath276 is the efficiency . using an accretion luminosity of @xmath277 l@xmath11@xcite ( based on [ oiv ] as a calibrator ) ,",
    "the accretion rate is 0.2 m@xmath11  year@xmath9 assuming 10%  efficiency . estimating a timescale for accretion by @xmath278 yields @xmath12 500 myr .",
    "this is only a few times the 200 - 300 myr estimated age of the nuclear stellar core ( the innermost 70 pc ) . by this estimate , the most recent star formation activity has only taken place for a portion of the agn s depletion timescale .",
    "we note that the timescale of accretion is proportional to efficiency , which is not well known , but most likely we are underestimating the timescale rather than overestimating , considering that the efficiency is likely between 10 - 100% @xcite but not significantly lower than 10% .",
    "there are also uncertainties in the total gas mass , leaving it difficult to precisely compare the timescales .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the age of nuclear starburst and agn luminosity ; of their sample of 8 galaxies , ngc 1068 had one of the oldest starbursts and also is one of the most luminous agn , accreting at a significant fraction of its eddington luminosity .",
    "it is interesting that the cnd hosts a significant amount of dense gas that could be used for star formation , yet no significant star formation is currently happening .",
    "@xcite theorize that there is a delay between a starburst and agn activity and that the starburst activity can help power the agn . though the nuclear starburst began 200 - 300 myr ago and has since effectively ended ,",
    "its influence is still significant because it likely contributed to making ngc 1068 such a strong agn , which now is the primary influence of the dense molecular gas as we saw in the xdr analysis of the previous section .",
    "confidence intervals for z - spec line ratios .",

    "we have presented a new broadband spectrum of ngc 1068 obtained with z - spec , complementing the current literature with a set of common - calibration measurements of co , its isotopes , and other high - density tracing molecules . after extending the modeling procedure of @xcite to include multiple species as in @xcite",

    "radiative transfer analysis can not substantially constrain the temperature of the cnd , but we argue there is evidence for a warm component , so future models should reflect higher gas temperatures . though the temperature and density are degenerate",

    "are also well constrained .",
    "we also presented models assuming greater contributions to the flux by the starburst ring , and found that these scenarios are difficult to reproduce with well - constrained models .",
    "however , one of the models may represent a separate , cooler component that could be distinct from warmer gas .",
    "should future studies indicate that our preferred model underestimates the contribution of the starburst ring , the results would change systematically as described in  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "in addition to the radiative transfer analysis , we compared the z - spec measured line ratios to those predicted by xdr and pdr models .",
    "our line ratios , measured using a consistent calibration scheme , match extremely well with xdr models at the densities found in our radiative transfer models .",
    "these provide strong independent support of the xdr nature of ngc 1068 s cnd .",
    "both the pdr / xdr ratio analysis and the radiative transfer modeling of hco@xmath0  alone indicate that hco@xmath0  may be tracing a different component of gas than the other molecules used in this work ( hcn , hnc , cs ) .",
    "future studies of ngc 1068 by the spire instrument on the herschel space observatory will shed further light on the conditions of the cnd .",
    "the fourier transform spectrometer should be able to fill out the co ladder from @xmath70  to @xmath279 which will better constrain the temperature of the molecular gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectroscopic imaging capability will offer the opportunity to compare the conditions of the cnd vs. the starburst ring .",
    "we predict that even some of the higher - j transitions of the high - density tracers from the cnd will be measureable with herschel s hifi instrument .",
    "alma will also be crucial in the further study of ngc 1068 , especially to resolve the separate components within the cnd .",
