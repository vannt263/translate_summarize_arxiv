    "lack of a long - lived internal state in our particle , such as those employed in sideband resolved manipulation of trapped atomic ions , means that many techniques for engineering fock states in ion traps  @xcite can not be applied here .",
    "instead we appeal to optomechanics : inspired by cantilever experiments  @xcite , where a microfabricated cantilever provides one mirror of a high - finesse cavity , we use the levitated metallic superconducting particle of sufficient reflectivity as one mirror in a tightly focused , plano - concave , high optical q cavity .",
    "cantilever position can be monitored at the shot - noise limit  @xcite , and protocols have been proposed to prepare  @xcite and reconstruct  @xcite fock states in these systems .",
    "there are experiments with levitated hybrid nanoparticle ion - optomechanical systems , albeit with sub - wavelength particles  @xcite .",
    "creation of fock states of mechanical motion or phonon number states for @xmath63 particles has previously been proposed for a magnetically - levitated superconducting microsphere coupled to a quantum circuit  @xcite , while its experimental demonstration is yet to be shown .",
    "we predict a new self - gravity effect to shift the energy states of a massive mechanical oscillator .",
    "we propose an experimental scenario which makes use of the best parts of the mature technology of levitation of ions in paul traps , the cavity enhanced optical position readout and the use of superconducting materials to avoid competing heating effects for instance by black body radiation . our proposal is based on technology available today .",
    "however , the different techniques have to be combined",
    ". it does not require the preparation and tomography of squeezed states of the mechanical harmonic oscillator .",
    "mechanical fock states need to be prepared and read out , which is technology under intense development as of today and has yet to be achieved .",
    "the self - gravity induced energy level splitting effect survives also for states above the mechanical vacuum state , and hence particularly for thermal states , which means cooling to the ground state is not required as such .",
