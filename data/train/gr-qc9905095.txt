    "we solve for the fluctuation field @xmath5 also , and find that we have resonant tunneling and particle production . to solve for the fields under the barrier we use neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the particle production rate was calculated by analytically continuing the @xmath5-solution from under the barrier , through the turning point ( at @xmath11 ) and comparing it with what should have been a positive frequency wave in the true vacuum region .",
    "the parameter `` @xmath8 '' played the role of a time - variable under the barrier and letting it run from 0 to @xmath12 was equivalent to summing up over all instantons in the dilute gas approximation @xmath13 .",
    "thus the `` time - evolution '' of the field is equivalent to the trajectory over the ensemble of paths ( dep s ) in configuration space .",

    "+   + the fluctuation field @xmath14 around the dep , i.e. around the field @xmath15 , gives rise to particle production .",

    "+   + it is well known that the qualitative behavior of a qfth is not determined by the fundamental lagrangian but rather by the nature of the renormalization group flow and its fixed points[1 ] . these , in turn , depend only on the basic symmetries that are imposed on the family of `` @xmath26 '' that flow into one - another . exploiting the analogy between statistical mechanics and qfth ,",
    "it has been shown that there is a strong relation between critical exponents of statistical mechanics and the running of coupling constants to their fixed points in qfth .",

    "thus the two pictures are revealing that they are , in fact , equivalent .",
    "namely the application of the lee - yang theorem and finding the poles of the @xmath119-matrix .",
    "a pole of the @xmath119-matrix in the imaginary momentum ( the euclidean region ) is equivalent to the partition function becoming zero , since the latter goes as the exponential of the negative 2-point function ( in our wkb approximation ) .",

    "this connection is very useful since we can find the phase structure of tunneling in real time by studying the poles and phase shifts of the @xmath119-matrix through scattering theory . as",
    "a simple application of this method we can make use of the result ( 1.2 ) found in a previous paper [ 3 ] .",
    "there , in order to calculate the particle production number @xmath17 , we needed to solve a schrodinger equation under the barrier , i.e. in the euclidean region .",

    "those two coefficients were the reflection and transmission coefficients respectively , in the language of quantum scattering theory ( see eq .",
    "( 3.17 - 3.19 ) of paper[3 ] for the details ) .",
    "thus a pole in the @xmath119- matrix element corresponds to the reflection coefficient @xmath22 becoming zero .",
    "but this coefficient @xmath22 becomes zero at values of the momentum p which are also the resonant peaks of @xmath17 ( fig.1.2 ) i.e. at @xmath120 .",

    "they dominate over other fluctuations and there is no tunneling or resonance .",

    "as in the peirles model [ 2 ] , of liquid - gas transition , bubbles below critical size shrink gradually to zero , while above the critical size they grow by condensing with the other bubbles until they reach complete condensation where there is one giant bubble that covers the whole space .",

    "+   + it is important to note that once we increase the temperature , the particle creation number is exponentially suppressed by @xmath146 , despite that the prefactor increases with temperature ; thus , it is consistent to neglect in the equations of motion for the tunneling field @xmath4 , the coupling of the @xmath4 field to the fluctuatuion field @xmath5 , even at finite temperatures up to @xmath56 .",
    "the reason , as given by the above argument , is that the fluctuation field @xmath147 remains small even at finite temperature due to the exponential suppression @xmath148 .",

    "* tunneling is a first order phase transition . *",
    "thus , it is always accompanied by particle creation , as the first order transitions are always associated with a mass gap ( defined as the inverse of the correlation length @xmath73 as in eqn ( 2.14 ) ) , while in the second order transitions the mass gap vanishes(see theorem ii ) . since the mass gap decreases with the increase of temperature while approaching the critical point ( from below ) , the particle production number due to tunneling ( i.e. the one that arises as a result of quantum fluctuations around the dep s ) should also decrease .",
    "quantitatively this result is clear from formula 1.2 for @xmath134 with the temperature dependence of the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath139,@xmath126 and @xmath4 given in ( 4.1 ) below .",
    "* lee - yang theorem for phase transitions is equivalent to finding the poles of the scattering matrix element in the sense that the corresponding partition function always becomes zero when the 2-point function of qfth ( s - matrix element ) , calculated in the imaginary values of momentum , becomes divergent .",

    "the instanton - antiinstanton pairs of the tunneling field @xmath4 form metastable bound states which give rise to resonant particle production , and thus the phase transition .",
    "the usefulness of this realization stands in the fact that we can study the phase structure of finite temperature tunneling in real time by finding the poles in the @xmath119-matrix.(of course , having the poles and subsequently the phase shifts , one could calculate the scattering cross - section from the optical theorem.as an aside , often the method of poles in the s - matrix is useful when one has little knowledge about the potential term in the lagrangian ) .",
    "* we obtained the temperature dependence of the coefficients in the lagrangian ( 1.1 ) by the analogy with ( 2.5 ) .",

    "@xmath149 where @xmath150 ( critical temperature and crossover temperature ) .",
    "in principle one could calculate ( 4.1 ) by using the rge .",
    "that would be quite an elaborate and long calculation .",
    "thanks to the analogy between the two models described above , ( respectively the semiclassical qfth model of vacuum decay and the ferromagnet ) , we can instead use these results from the landau theory of critical exponents in this case . * finally , despite that the wall thickness of each bubble increases with temperature , their number is suppressed .",
    "thus , the dilute gas approximation remains valid below and up to @xmath71 , until at the critical temperature there is only one bubble left with an infinite wall thickness .",
    "this is the point where 1st order phase transition ends and the two phases have meshed together in a disoriented phase . during this process , bubbles with radius larger than critical , continued growing and blending together into yet larger bubbles thus their number is decreasing until there is one very large ( infinitely thick wall ) bubble left .",
