    "_ introduction - _ [ intro ] short - pulsed x - ray photons , e.g. , from the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) have begun to provide data in hitherto inaccessible regimes of matter  @xcite .",
    "such information is of interest in understanding normal matter under extreme conditions  @xcite , as well as at new frontiers in high - energy - density matter , astrophysics , fusion physics etc .",
    "such non - equilibrium systems are also produced in semiconductor devices  @xcite .",
    "the theory involves complicated many - body effects and the quantum mechanics of finite - temperature non - equilibrium systems . standard _",
    "ab - initio _ methods are inapplicable or computationally prohibitive for this ultra - fast matter ( ufm ) regime .",
    "extensions of elementary plasma models or thomas - fermi models fail badly .",
    "hence computationally simple realistic theories of these systems are essential in the interpretation of experiments on ufm which is a sub - class of warm - dense - matter ( wdm )  @xcite . here",
    "we use a finite-@xmath0 density - functional theory ( dft ) calculation of the electronic charge distribution @xmath1 and the ion charge distribution @xmath2 around an al ion in the system as the basic ingredient of such a theory .",
    "the neutral pseudoatom ( npa ) model of perrot and dharma - wardana  @xcite is used in this study .",
    "the lcls results  @xcite of the plasmon feature and the dynamic and static conductivities @xmath3 of al up to 6 ev , isochorically held at solid density dramatically improves on the accuracy of the earlier ufm experiments  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly low static conductivities @xmath4 of ufm aluminum are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , even at 0.2 ev .",
    "we present two - temperature ( 2@xmath0 ) calculations for isochoric aluminum .",
    "atomic units ( a.u . , @xmath5 ) are used , and the temperature is in energy units .",
    "the ion temperature @xmath6 is the initial ` room ' temperature , while only the electron temperature @xmath7 is raised to 6 ev by the 50 femto - second x - ray pulse .",
    "we do not get the gradual decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath0 found for equilibrium non - isochoric aluminum .",
    "instead , we reproduce the low static conductivities reported in the experiment",
    ". the high conductivities of the normal solid and the molten metal ( @xmath8 ) at low @xmath0 are partly attributed to the position of the scattering momentum @xmath9 _ falling within the second minimum _ in the ion - ion structure factor @xmath10 . in an isochoric ufm",
    "solid , the ions have no time to adjust to the rapidly heated electrons . the ions ( and their bound electrons )",
    "remain frozen at their lattice sites , and at @xmath6 .",
    "hence @xmath10 , and the bare electron - ion pseudopotential @xmath11 remain essentially unchanged , even up to @xmath12 ev . the thermal smearing of the fermi sphere is set by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electron fermi function .",
    "it s overlap with the ion - ion @xmath10 , and the electron - ion scattering cross section determine the conductivity @xmath4 as well as @xmath15 .",
    "the new experiment provides the profile of the plasmon resonance .",
    "we present a simple theory of the momentum relaxation and energy dephasing frequency @xmath16 ( also known as the ` collision frequency ' ) , using a born approximation constructed to match the @xmath17 conductivity obtained from the npa phase shifts .",
    "the calculated plasmon profile is in good accord with experiment .    _ the dft - npa model for isochoric ufm aluminum - _",
    "an aluminum nucleus is placed in an electron subsystem and an ion subsystem , within a large sphere ( @xmath18 30 au . ) where all particle correlations reach bulk values as @xmath19 .",
    "hence this ` neutral - pseudo - atom ' ( npa ) is not an ` average - atom cell - model ' similar to the inferno model of lieberman or its improvements  @xcite . the electron density in the bulk , viz .",
    ", @xmath20 is 1.81@xmath21 electrons/@xmath22 , has an electron - sphere radius @xmath23 au .",
    "the free - electron pile up @xmath24 and the scattering phase shifts @xmath25 around the al nucleus are calculated via the kohn - sham equations , using a step - function to mimic the ion - ion pair distribution function @xmath26 .",
    "this is known to work well for al  @xcite .",
    "the phase - shifts satisfy the friedel sum rule , and the dft uses a finite-@xmath0 exchange - correlation contribution  @xcite .",
    "all the results in this study follow from the npa output .",
    "the many - ion system is built up via the @xmath10 as a superposition of npas , using the @xmath10 derived within the theory . at room temperature ,",
    "this calculation yields an ionization @xmath27 and an ion wigner - seitz radius @xmath28 2.99 au .",
    "the @xmath29 is held constant while @xmath7 is increased , to mimic the isochoric ufm , where as normal solid or liquid al expands ( i.e , @xmath29 increases ) with temperature .",
    "a static electron response function @xmath30 is constructed , with its local field correction ( lfc ) satisfying the compressibility sumrule at each temperature .",
    "this defines a fully local pseudopotential @xmath31 , and an ion - ion pair potential @xmath32 .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath33 is fitted to a heine - abarenkov form for convenience .",

    "@xmath36 is the linear - response charge pileup .",
    "this approach is capable of milli - volt accuracy and reproduces even the high - temperature phonons  @xcite discussed by , e.g. , recoules et al  @xcite ( but phonons do not form during ufm timescales ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath37 is used in the modified hyper - netted - chain equation ( mhnc ) yielding the @xmath10 at the ion temperature @xmath6 ( which is the initial temperature of the system at the arrival of the x - ray pulse ) .",
    "since the initial al - crystal has an fcc structure , it is sufficient to use the spherically averaged @xmath10 taken as a ` frozen fluid ' , say , at 0.06 ev .",
    "the latter is the lowest temperature at which the hnc could be converged , since the melting point is @xmath38 0.082 ev .",
    "the results are insensitive to the use of an @xmath10 at 0.06 ev or , say , 0.082 ev . our mhnc procedure is accurate enough to closely reproduce the experimental @xmath10 of normal liquid aluminum  @xcite .",
    "_ the complex conductivity @xmath15 - _ the drude theory with a static @xmath43 is known to be inadequate for @xmath15 except at small and high @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "sperling et al  @xcite have used a mermin model ( diffusion pole )  @xcite augmented by plasma many - body theory  @xcite where they combine components of born ( b ) , lenard - balescu ( lb ) and gould - dewitt ( gdw)-mermin ( m ) approaches in their analysis where @xmath45 .",
    "the real part of the complex conductivity @xmath46 , obtained via b - lb - gdw - m is two orders of magnitude too large compared to experiment , although the imaginary part @xmath47 as well as the plasmon profile are in much better accord .",
    "they use several models of @xmath10 , point - ion coulomb potentials as well as pseudopotentials .",

    ", the ion-@xmath42 at @xmath6 remains intact for all @xmath7 .",
    "we first calculate @xmath4 using the electron phase shifts obtained from the npa and obtain good agreement with experiment .",
    "the calculation of @xmath15 via the phase shifts is more demanding . instead",
    ", since al is a `` simple metal '' , an ashcroft pseudopotential @xmath48 specified only by the core radius @xmath49 that reproduces the @xmath4 could be found .",
    "this @xmath49 is consistent with the npa value .",
    "this is used in calculating @xmath15 .",
    "there is no low - frequency ` diffusion pole ' in the experimental spectra as expected from mermin theory .",
    "mermin assumes that the ions respond perfectly to the electron - density fluctuations and maintain local charge neutrality .",
    "this holds for timescales @xmath50 much larger than the electron - ion temperature relaxation time @xmath51 which is many pico - seconds  @xcite if @xmath52 , or for timescales significantly larger than phonon timescales if @xmath45 .",
    "thus the mermin model is largely inappropriate for most ufm - wdm systems .",
    "hence we examine a simple rpa - like model where the ions are mere immobile scatterers during the 50 fs signal , and obtain good overall agreement with experiment .",
    "the conductivity @xmath15 can be expressed via the force - force correlation function as given in standard texts  ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite sec .",
    "if plane waves are used for the free electrons , the limit @xmath17 recovers the ziman formula .",
    "however , if the electron - ion interactions are strong , then the electron response @xmath53 and the dynamic conductivity @xmath15 should be expressed via the electron eigenstates @xmath54 of the system  @xcite .",
    "the npa provides these , with @xmath55 for core - states , and @xmath56 for continuum states , with the @xmath57 quantum number and spin summed over  @xcite .",
    "the core states give bound - bound transitions , while the bound - continuum and continuum - continuum transitions are also included . if numerical eigenstates @xmath58 are not available , hydrogenic functions can be used within a many - body theory as in ref .",
    "such `` green - kubo '' formulae for @xmath15 usually need heavy numerical codes .",
