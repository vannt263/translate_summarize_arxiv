    "the presence of symmetries in physical laws in most cases greatly enhances our understanding of their nature and consequences .",
    "symmetries , either exact or only approximate , have a particular importance in the fields of elementary particle and nuclear physics .",
    "the approximate charge independence of nuclear forces , ultimately related to the near degeneracy of up and down quarks @xcite , permits to treat protons and neutrons as different states of the same particle ( the nucleon ) and to classify nuclear states according to the different representation of a symmetry group , the isospin su(2 ) . in this scheme , protons and neutrons are characterised by the isospin quantum number @xmath1 , with third component @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "states of nuclei with the same mass number @xmath4 can be grouped , according to the value of the isospin @xmath5 , in isospin multiplets of @xmath6 states belonging to the different nuclei , distinguished by the value of @xmath7 isospin symmetry is violated by the electromagnetic interaction ( mostly due to coulomb forces among protons ) and , to a lesser extent , also by nuclear forces . however , the most important part of the coulomb interactions is diagonal with respect to @xmath8 and mainly contributes to the mass difference between various members of the isospin multiplet .",
    "finer effects of the symmetry - breaking forces can be investigated by measuring the so - called mirror energy differences @xcite or , more generally , differences in excitation energies among members of a multiplet . in recent years , this field has become the object of a considerable number of experimental and theoretical studies , as the level schemes of nuclei with @xmath2 ( i.e. z = n+1 ) could be measured for increasingly larger values of a. furthermore , when transition probabilities could be determined , their comparison between mirror nuclei opened an important window to investigate the amount and the origin of isospin violation .    here",
    ", we limit our discussion to the relatively simple case of e1 transitions @xcite . the e1 transition operator is expected to be pure isovector , at least in the limit of long wavelengths , where siegert s theorem  @xcite holds .",
    "this fact implies that ( 1 ) e1 transitions with @xmath9 in nuclei with @xmath10 are forbidden , and that ( 2 ) corresponding e1 transitions in mirror nuclei have equal reduced strength .",
    "both rules are to some extent violated by isospin - non - conserving ( mainly , coulomb ) interactions . in the z",
    "= n case , these violations appear as second order effects , while in mirror nuclei the effect is of first order .",
    "the difference is due to the interference between the _ irregular _ amplitude ( symmetric with respect to the exchange of the two nuclei in the doublet ) with the regular amplitude ( which is isovector , antisymmetric with respect to the exchange ) .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the relative importance of different possible sources of asymmetry in mirror e1 transitions . as a simple example",
    ", we consider in particular those nuclei which can be described by the nuclear shell model in a limited hilbert space , containing a full major shell and the unique - parity intruder from the next major shell . although the particle - hole excitations involving all states of the higher shell must be considered for a reliable description of the e1 transitions , we assume that the largest part of the e1 amplitudes only involves the intruder orbital @xmath11 and , as a consequence , only the largest - j orbital , @xmath12 , of the lower major shell .",
    "it is important to note that the inclusion of more orbitals in the calculation , briefly discussed in appendix [ s : a3 ] , does not change substantially most of the results .",
    "actually , strong asymmetries in b(e1 ) values have been observed in several mirror transitions , e.g. pairs of mirror nuclei of the sd and pf major shells @xcite .",
    "the clearest examples , however , were found in light @xmath13 nuclei , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "such nuclei often exhibit large differences in the neutron and proton binding energies , and coupling to the continuum needs to be taken into account .",
    "the present discussion is limited instead to heavier mirror nuclei , in which the smaller binding energy of the proton is compensated by the larger coulomb barrier .    as a typical example ( `` benchmark '' in this work )",
    ", we consider the mirror pair @xmath0as - @xmath0se , whose structure involves the pf shell plus the @xmath16 intruder orbital .",
    "this doublet has been investigated in a recent experiment at gammasphere @xcite .",
    "two pairs of mirror transitions with a sizable e1 component have been observed , connecting the lowest @xmath17 state to lower lying @xmath18 levels ( fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] ) .",
    "the measured e1 strengths and the absolute value of the corresponding e1 matrix elements are reported in table  [ t:1 ] .",
    "the @xmath17 state has presumably a rather pure @xmath16 character , while the daughter states have a complex structure and contain only a small component that can be reached by the e1 transition . as a consequence , the observed values of b(e1 )",
    "are very small .",
    "all numerical results reported in the following will refer to this particular pair of nuclei .",
    "the radial integrals have been obtained with single - particle wavefunctions in a woods - saxon potential with spin - orbit interaction , as specified in @xcite .",
    "these integrals change slowly with the atomic number , and for the @xmath19 transitions in the middle of the @xmath20 shell they would give results very close to those of the @xmath21 transitions in mass a=67 .     in section [ s:1 ]",
    ", we derive the expression of the e1 transition amplitude from the intruder state @xmath22 to one of the normal - parity states @xmath23 .",
    "no specific assumptions are made on the structure of these states , apart from the fact that orbits of the higher major shell , different from the intruder , give negligible contribution .    in the following sections , we discuss the different processes that can lead to the presence of an ( induced ) isoscalar e1 transition amplitude , in addition to the main isovector term . in section [ s:2 ]",
    "we consider the effect of higher order terms in the nucleonic current , in addition to those considered in the siegert theorem , which are increasingly important when the long - wavelength assumption fails .    in section [ s:3 ]",
    "we discuss several simple effects related to the mixing of wavefunctions : the coulomb mixing between neighboring states ( [ s:4.1 ] ) and between states of very similar structure , such as the analogue  antianalogue mixing ( [ s:4.2 ] ) .",
    "none of the processes considered up to this point seems able to justify the observed asymmetry .",
    "we can conclude that the difference in the wavefunctions of the two mirror nuclei involves many ( weak ) mixing with a large number of states , possibly lying rather far in energy from the levels considered .",
    "there are two different approaches to consider this situation . in the most direct treatment ,",
    "the residual interactions in the two mirror nuclei are assumed from the start to be different and to include the coulomb interaction ( as well as other possible isospin violating terms ) .",
    "it is well known that most of the e1 strength is shifted to higher - lying _ collective _ states , while the low - lying e1 transitions remain substantially hindered , due to the destructive interference among the individual contributions .",
    "if the residual interactions are not identical in the two mirror nuclei , the negative interference can amplify substantially these differences in the resulting b(e1 ) .",
    "this mechanism is easy to understand , but even if a shell model calculation in this necessarily huge hilbert space were to become possible , the results would scarcely be    transparent with respect to the nature of the processes involved .",
    "one could consider , however , the _ same _ problem from a different point of view .",
    "namely , let one suppose that a zeroth - order calculation were performed with isospin - conserving residual interaction .",
    "as a next approximation , coulomb interactions could be included to evaluate , to first order , the mixing among zeroth - order states . as in the former approach",
    ", one should expect that coherent contributions from collective states play an significant role in producing the e1 asymmetry , as well as the concentration of the e1 strength in the collective states has a role in depleting the e1 strengths of low - lying transitions .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it can give semi - quantitative predictions on the b(e1 ) asymmetries , even without knowledge of their absolute value .",
    "furthermore , it would elucidate the principal process ( or processes ) responsible for the largest part of the observed effects .    a process of such kind , which could in principle account for the magnitude of the observed effects ( namely , the coherent contribution of states belonging to the giant isovector monopole resonance ) is discussed in detail in section [ s:4.3 ] .",

    "the mirror asymmetry in the e1 strength is therefore , approximately , @xmath209 and the ratio @xmath210 .",
    "we note , however , that such a large asymmetry has been obtained for a pure configuration of the analogue and antianalogue states , while the antianalogue strength is usually spread over a number of final states  @xcite , a situation which will strongly reduce the mirror asymmetry in the e1 strength .",
    "a detailed shell - model investigation would possibly elucidate the role of the analogue - antianalogue mixing in the e1 asymmetry between mirror nuclei , as the analogue and the antianalogue states can be described in the same shell - model space .      the coulomb mixing discussed in the previous subsections involves states belonging to the same set of shell - model orbits necessary for the ( unperturbed ) parent and daughter state of the e1 transitions ( presumably limited to two major shells ) .",
    "however , it is well known that a comparatively large contribution to the isospin mixing comes from states outside this model space , as those belonging to the giant isovector monopole resonance  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the mixing with any of these higher - lying states , induced by the isovector part of the coulomb interaction , is expected to be very small .",
    "the combined effect of many higher - lying states on the e1 transition amplitude can however become appreciable if their individual contributions combine coherently .",
    "we shall see how this can be the case .",
    "we have seen ( eqs .",
    "[ e:35],[e:35b ] ) that the non - diagonal isovector part of the coulomb interaction @xmath110 can be approximated with a one - body operator @xmath172 , having the same form of the isovector monopole operator @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , it is a sensible approximation  @xcite to consider in the ensemble of states @xmath212 , @xmath213 ( with @xmath214 ) of eqs .",
