    "only armchair swnts were believed to be truly metallic . indeed , because of the curvature , zigzag and chiral swnts with @xmath8 multiple of 3 , present a small band gap of few tens of mev @xcite , and for this reason are called quasi - metallic ( qm )  @xcite .",
    "however , recent transport measurements on chirality - identified tubes showed that also armchair tubes are qm with @xmath10 to @xmath11  mev , likely because of electrons correlation @xcite .    the description and interpretation of the transport properties of swnt devices ,",
    "are often based on a semi - classical approach such as the boltzmann transport equation ( bte )  @xcite .",
    "however , the bte can not describe some cases such us strong localization regimes  @xcite .",
    "another effect that can not be described by the boltzmann transport approach is the zener tunneling ( zt ) @xcite , which is the electric - field - induced tunneling of carriers from one band to another through the forbidden energy gap @xmath9 . in absence of zt ,",
    "if the temperature is smaller than the gap ( @xmath12 ) , only one type of carrier is responsible for charge transport : when the fermi level , @xmath13 , is in the conduction ( valence ) band , the current is carried by electrons ( holes ) .",

    "the current is carried simultaneously by both electrons and holes and a non - zero current exists even if @xmath13 is in the gap region .",
    "the critical electric field @xmath14 for which the zt affects transport properties , can be estimated considering the inter - band tunneling probability across the gap of the swnt hyperbolic bands . in absence of scattering ,",

    "electric field is a super - linear curve for @xmath210 .",
    "such a behavior was observed in graphene @xcite and in large diameter nanotubes @xcite , and identified as due to zener tunneling .",
    "let us compare the results for the different scattering lengths @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ mcur5 ] ) .",
    "zener tunneling should be more visible for @xmath211 50  nm , than for @xmath211 300  nm , for two reasons .",
    "first , for @xmath211 50  nm , the zener current is already relevant for electric fields smaller than @xmath14 ( this is explained in the discussion related to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "second , for @xmath211 50  nm @xmath212 , while for @xmath211 300  nm @xmath213 .",
    "now , the scattering with optical phonons is associated to a sub - linear current which tend to mask the presence of the super - linear zener current . for @xmath211 50  nm",
    ", @xmath214 means that this `` masking '' does not occur in the region of interest . for @xmath211 300  nm",
    ", @xmath213 means that this `` masking '' is already active in the region where zener is active . beside this",
    ", one should also consider that in the present simulations we are not including the possibility of hot phonons .",
    "the inclusion of this effect would decrease the differential conductance for @xmath215 .",
    "this should not change the @xmath211 50  nm curves but should further mask the zener current in the @xmath211 300  nm case .",
    "finally , in by fig.[map3 ] and [ map5 ] we present the two - dimensional maps of the current as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath13 . in one of the panels",
    ", we also report the difference between the current obtained within the quantum approach and that of the semi - classical calculation .",
    "this difference is higher where the zener tunneling is more important . for metallic tubes ,",
    "the current does not depend on the fermi level because , within the linear band approximation , the electronic density of states is a constant . note that for sufficiently high @xmath13 values the semi - classical and the quantum results for the qm tubes are almost indistinguishable and approach the results for the metallic tubes .",
    "it is instructive to compare the steady - state distribution functions of the electronic populations associated with the semi - classical or quantum approaches .",
    "[ disthlf ] reports the distribution functions obtained for @xmath190  nm and the fermi level @xmath216  ev , that is for conditions in which the quantum effects are relevant . in qm tubes ,",
    "when the quantum approach is used both electron and hole contribute to the current , whereas in the semiclassical approach only electrons carry a current since the valence band is filled .",
    "interestingly , at high field the population of qm tubes tends to that of metallic tubes only when the quantum approach is used .",
    "indeed , in the metallic tube ( which corresponds to the limit @xmath217 ) the tunneling between valence and conduction band is total .",
    "the metallic limit can be reached only when one includes interband transitions .",
    "[ disthlf ] also shows the imaginary part of the off - diagonal element of the density matrix @xmath218 .",
    "this quantity is different from zero when quantum effects are relevant .",
    "one can remark that zener tunneling turns on near @xmath219 ( with a maximum at @xmath219 ) and decays after few oscillations for @xmath220 .",
    "the typical wave vector associated with these oscillations is @xmath221 , @xmath9 being the electronic gap .",
    "we have presented a theoretical model based on the master equation to explore the quantum effects ( inter - band transitions induced by electric field or zener tunneling ) on the transport properties of homogeneous quasi - metallic carbon nanotubes ( qm ) .",
    "the presence and relevance of the zener tunneling has been highlighted by comparing with a semi - classical boltzmann transport approach , in which the inter - band transitions are neglected .",
    "we studied qm tube with an electronic gap @xmath222  mev in the presence of impurities or defects which influence the transport by providing an elastic scattering channel for the carriers .",
    "zener tunneling is relevant for small doping , when the fermi energy lies in or close to the forbidden gap @xmath9 . in absence of elastic scattering ( in high quality samples ) , the small size of the band gap of qm tubes enables zener tunnelling for realistic values of the the electric field ( above @xmath0 1 v/@xmath1 m ) .",
    "however , for such electric fields the scattering with the optical phonons ( whose effect is underestimated in the present approach ) tends to mask the zener current . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of a strong elastic scattering ( in low quality samples ) further decreases the values of the field required to observe zener tunnelling .",
    "indeed , for elastic - scattering lengths of the order of 50 nm , zener tunnelling affects the current / voltage characteristic already in the linear regime . in other words ,",
    "zener tunneling is made visible by defects in qm tubes .",
    "this result is similar to what has been recently shown for graphene @xcite .",
