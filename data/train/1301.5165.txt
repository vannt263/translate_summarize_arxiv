    "one of the most striking properties of elliptical galaxies is the remarkable quasi - homology of their surface brightness profiles , described by the so called srsic model , a generalization of the de vaucouleurs @xmath7 model ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) . albeit minor ( but important ) departures from the srsic model are common , overall the profiles on large scale are very well represented by the srsic law .",
    "what is the origin of such regularity ?",
    "@xmath8-body numerical simulations revealed that cold dissipationless and collisionless collapses lead to virialized end - states described almost perfectly by @xmath7 profiles ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently it has been shown that collapses in pre - existing dark matter halos are also well described by the srsic profile , with a wide range of values of the srsic index ( nipoti et al .",
    "2006ab , hereafter n06ab ) .",
    "in addition , it is also known that the srsic family is characterized by an exponential differential energy distribution , over a large range of accessible energies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results can be understood in terms of the physics of violent relaxation in collisionless collapses ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it has been proved analytically that in newtonian gravity a large class of spherically symmetric equilibrium systems are characterized by the so - called global density slope - anisotropy inequality ( hereafter gdsai , see ciotti & morganti 2010ab ; @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , a constraint between their anisotropy and density profiles .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the gdsai may be a much more general result , holding true also for the final states of dissipationless collapses ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ due to the relevance of these results for the understanding of the process of collisionless relaxation , a natural question arises about their apparent universality .",
    "in particular , are the srsic law , the associated differential exponential energy distribution and the gdsai peculiar features of newtonian gravity or are they more general properties of the virialized final states of @xmath8-body collapses in which the particles interact with long - range forces ?",
    "preliminary results seem to support the second possibility .",
    "for example , it is known that the end - products of cold collapses in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond , @xcite ) also produce final systems described remarkably well by the srsic law ( @xcite , hereafter n07a ; and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the @xmath0body mond simulations have also shown that the oscillations leading to relaxation last more ( in units of the dynamical time of the system ) than in the equivalent newtonian system ( see e.g. n07a ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover @xcite found indications that the gdsai may be a common property of mondian virialized systems .",
    "we recall that the force law in the mond weak field limit ( or deep - mond , hereafter dmond ) regime is qualitatively similar to a force decreasing with distance as @xmath9 .",
    "additional indications in this direction come from the preliminary analysis of di cintio ( 2009 , hereafter dc09 ) and di cintio & ciotti ( 2011 , hereafter dcc11 ) , who investigated the relaxation of a system of spherical shells interacting via a long - range @xmath1 force law , in analogy with similar studies performed in newtonian gravity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and mond ( sanders 1998 , 2008 ; malekjani et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "in dcc11 we focused on the time evolution of the virial ratio and of the differential energy distribution . among the main results",
    ", we confirmed the expectation that the process of relaxation , independently of the value of @xmath4 ( with the exception of @xmath5 ) , consists in a first phase of violent collapse , followed by a longer , gentle phase of dynamical mixing .",
    "remarkably , small values of @xmath4 correspond to larger and long - lasting virial oscillations , confirming the dmond results ( n07a ) .",
    "however , the final states of shell systems are only poorly described by an exponential differential energy distribution .",
    "this is not surprising since the enforced spherical symmetry reduces the number of degrees of freedom available for energy exchanges during virialization .",
    "+ prompted by these preliminary results , here we explore further the problem following the collapse and virialization of fully three - dimensional @xmath8-body systems of particles interacting with radial forces proportional to a power - law of the mutual separation , @xmath1 .",
    "this approach is not new , and here we recall the study of quasistationary states ( @xcite , @xcite ) and of yukawa - like gravity ( @xcite and references therein ; see also @xcite ) . for the simulations we developed a direct @xmath8-body code , exploiting the force additivity .",
    "note that for general forces , more sophisticated methods , based on the expansion in orthogonal functions of the potential , are not available , as the analogue of the poisson equation does not exist . in our case ,",
    "the considered forces even though additive , are described by _ non - local _ operators , i.e. the density at a given point can not be expressed as a simple differential operator of the potential at that point .",
    "in fact , the potentials associated with @xmath1 forces are the well known _",
    "riesz potentials _ , and the analogue of the poisson equation involves the so called fractional laplacian ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , for this specific cases , the potential can be expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials in turn expressible with an addition theorem on spherical harmonics , so that in principle a multipole based treecode can be realized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that mond is a non - linear but _ local _ theory .",

    "the structure and the dynamical properties of the virialized final states are presented and discussed as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the main results are finally summarized in section 5 .",

    "analogue of the dmond regime in which the mond force behaves qualitatively as @xmath9 .",
    "some authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) introduce the nomenclature of _ weak _ long - range interactions and _ strong _ long - range interactions depending on whether the force vanishes or diverges for @xmath20 ; here we label them as _ gravity - like _ ( @xmath21 ) or _ harmonic oscillator - like _ ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "@xmath41 i.e. @xmath32 remains constant during the virialization .",
    "remarkably , it can be shown analytically that the virial function is time - independent also in dmond , even though the field equation is not linear and the force is in general neither radial nor strictly proportional to @xmath9 , ( n07a ; for the special case of spherical systems see @xcite ) . as the total energy @xmath42 is conserved for all values of @xmath4 , oscillations in @xmath43",

    "only the kinetic energy changes during the virialization .",

    "remarkably , slightly bimodal final differential energy distributions characterize the systems starting from hotter initial conditions ( fig .",

    "one of the motivations of this study is to elucidate the reason of the long relaxation time ( in units of their dynamical time ) of dmond systems when compared to the same quantity for newtonian systems .",

    "the top panel illustrates the evolution for the family of gravity - like forces .",
    "the similarity with the results obtained with the shell models ( fig.1 in dcc11 ) is remarkable : a decrease of @xmath4 leads to a higher value of @xmath94 at the first peak , and to a longer series of virial oscillations of decreasing amplitude .",
    "curiously , for @xmath6 the amplitude of the virial oscillations increases again at large times , similarly to dmond collapses ( n07a , @xcite ) , confirming that dmond behaves qualitatively as the @xmath9 force when considering a system not deviating too much from spherical shape , reinforcing the previous result of the long relaxation times of @xmath0body systems governed by the non - linear field equation of mond .",
    "we interpret the large peak values of @xmath94 for small @xmath4 as due to the fact that the force is stronger on large scales , and that the systems with low @xmath4 collapse more as a whole , consistently with the force being more similar to the harmonic oscillator case .",
    "it is important to recall that in the newtonian case a spherical homogeneous shell does not exert any force inside , while inside a shell the force is directed outwards for @xmath134 , and the opposite happens for @xmath135 ( e.g. dcc11 ) .",
    "therefore , when @xmath134",
    "the external regions act _ against _ the collapse , while for @xmath135 also the external regions of the system contribute more and more to the collapse .",

    "[ virialeg ] .",
    "note how the virial ratio oscillates with peak values of @xmath94 significantly larger , and more regular oscillations than in the gravity - like cases .",
    "as expected , in the @xmath5 case no relaxation takes place , since the whole system behaves as a single harmonic oscillator ( e.g. @xcite , see also eq .",
    "( [ eqadim ] ) ) .",

    "in general , large values of @xmath53        correspond to small amplitudes of the first peak of @xmath94 .",
    "+ the long lasting virial oscillations for forces close to the harmonic oscillator are associated with a poorer mixing in phase space .",

    "consistently with the findings of dcc11 ( where the narrower interval of @xmath141 was studied ) , larger values of @xmath4 show a more efficient phase mixing with respect to systems with @xmath22 .",
    "again , the similarity with the plots in n07a ( their figure 4 ) and ciotti et al .",
    "( 2007 , their figures 2 and 3 ) is remarkable .",
    "one may speculate that the coherent structures in phase space that persist at large times ( in units of @xmath54 ) are akin to the so - called _ phase - space holes _ reported by some authors ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) in the context of the one dimensional infinite sheet model , where the mixing is quite poor .",
    "it must be pointed out that the poorer mixing in newtonian gravity in lower dimensions is essentially due to the smaller number of degrees of freedom that are involved in the relaxation rather than a different exponent in the force law ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as already remarked , the efficiency of phase mixing is non monotonic with @xmath4 , with no mixing for @xmath5 .",

    "the systems with @xmath6 show an intermediate behavior , with a trend similar to dmond collapses , ( see n07a , fig . 5 therein ) .",
    "for this latter case it is apparent how decreasing values of @xmath53 tend to populate the external regions of the final systems . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "a specific feature of the @xmath120 obtained in newtonian collapses is the exponential shape over some energy range . here , due to the energy sign associated with the value of @xmath4",
    "( see discussion in sect .",
    "2 ) we consider the function @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath109 are an inverse ( positive ) temperature and a normalization factor respectively .",
    "it is apparent that for @xmath23 the shape of @xmath120 can not be described by a single - temperature exponential distribution , independently of the hotness of the initial conditions .",
    "instead , for gravity - like forces with @xmath3 a larger energy range exists over which @xmath120 can be qualitatively described with an exponential function as in eq .",
    "( [ expdist ] ) .",
    "the main difference in the gravity - like forces is between @xmath6 case and the other case with @xmath24 ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) : while in the forces allowing for escape @xmath156 the exponential region is peaked towards high energies , in the @xmath6 case the peak is at low energies , corresponding to the central regions . interestingly , for @xmath3 the trend between the srsic index @xmath10 and the inverse temperature @xmath155 of the best fit @xmath120 , is qualitatively similar to what found by @xcite in the analysis of the newtonian srsic models .",
    "we finally note how the current @xmath0body simulations produced final @xmath120 much better described by an exponential distribution than in the shell model ( dcc11 ) , a natural consequence of a better energy exchange among the components of the system .",
    "for the final states of the systems with @xmath24 we also considered the fraction of escapers ( i.e. particles having positive energy , see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as expected , at fixed @xmath4 and for given initial density profile , with low values of @xmath53 ( i.e. , cold initial conditions ) there is a larger number of escapers .",
    "also , for fixed density profile and @xmath53 , the fraction of escapers is found to be weakly dependent on the value of @xmath4 , with values @xmath157% for most cases and with the maximum value of @xmath158% for perfectly cold plummer model with @xmath159 .",
    "+ another property of interest , recently focus of several investigations , is the so - called pseudo phase space density ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) defined as @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the angle - averaged density and velocity dispersion at radius @xmath163 . for newtonian collapses ,",
    "the numerical simulations have unequivocally shown that @xmath164 is described quite well by a power - law @xmath165 neither the origin of this relationship nor the dependence of this property on the initial conditions are yet fully understood despite the numerous efforts . on one side , the results of numerical simulations seem to point out to a remarkable robustness of eq.([qpowrlaw ] ) : even though the power - law trend of @xmath164 was initially considered a peculiarity of the nfw profiles ( @xcite ) , it is known that other profiles share this property ( e.g. the family of self - consistent @xmath166 models , see @xcite , @xcite ) . however , there are self - consistent equilibrium systems where @xmath164 is not a power - law ( e.g. the plummer sphere ) .",
    "therefore it is natural to ask wether the power - law is a specific feature of violent relaxation in newtonian gravity or its origin should be searched more in the physics of dissipationless collapse , independently of the force law involved .",
    "here we are in the ideal position to address this question , and in fact the obtained results are quite significant .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ beta0 ] ( right panel ) a power - law trend for @xmath164 is reproduced surprisingly well also in the case of non - newtonian forces .",
    "for all the considered case ( with the exception of @xmath167 ) , and independently of the initial density profile , at fixed @xmath53 the exponent @xmath168 increases for decreasing @xmath4 and the function @xmath164 steepens .",
    "we also found that at fixed @xmath4 , @xmath164 steepens for decreasing @xmath53 .",
    "these findings lead to conclude that a power - law radial dependence of @xmath164 is more a consequence of violent relaxation than of the newton gravity law . +",
    "finally , we check if the ( angle - averaged ) global density slope anisotropy inequality ( gdsai ) is obeyed by the end products for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "ciotti & morganti ( 2010ab ) , prompted by the important asymptotic result of @xcite , proved that a very large class of newtonian stellar systems with positive phase - space distribution function , necessarily obey the inequality @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the logarithmic density slope and        @xmath171    is the usual anisotropy parameter ( @xcite ) . in the formula above @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the radial and tangential component of the velocity dispersion tensor respectively . in particular , @xcite speculated about a possible universality the gdsai , even though their analytical methods where unable to treat the cases with @xmath174 .",
    "significant progress and clarification has been made in the subject ( @xcite , @xcite ) and now the case of systems with _",
    "separable augmented density _ is well understood : the gdsai is obeyed by all separable systems with @xmath175 , while counterexamples exist for systems with @xmath174 .",
    "much less is known about systems with non - separable augmented density , but numerical simulations in newtonian gravity seem to suggest that also in general systems the gdsai is usually satisfied .",
    "here we analyzed the results of the simulations for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath53 .",
    "the trends of @xmath176 and @xmath177 , obtained using spherical averages and excluding the innermost regions ( where discreteness effects dominate ) , revealed that the final states obey the gdsai ( with the obvious exception of the harmonic oscillator force ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ gammas ] where , even in presence of numerical noise , it is apparent that overall @xmath178 , reinforcing the idea that the physical process leading to the establishment of the gdsai may be independent of the specific force law considered . finally , from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ gammas ] , it is also interesting to note how the final systems are significantly radially anisotropic in their outer regions , and become more and more isotropic near the centre , as also commonly found in newtonian simulations .",
    "the @xmath148 case stands out as the less anisotropic and it is curious to recall that these systems are also those for which the srsic law provides the less satisfactory description ( fig .",
    "[ nesersic2 ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , several theoretical arguments point toward the importance of elucidating the process of dissipationless collapse and virialization of @xmath0body systems with additive interparticle forces proportional to @xmath1 , a generalization of the newtonian force . for this task we built a direct @xmath0body code : preliminary results obtained with a shell model in spherical symmetry ( @xcite , @xcite ) appear to be confirmed by the present simulations .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "+ the relaxation process , independently of the initial density profile ( hernquist or plummer ) , is characterized by a first phase of strong oscillations of the virial ratio , followed by a gentler phase of relaxation . for decreasing @xmath4 , the peak value of the virial ratio increases reaching a value formally infinite in the case of a perfectly cold collapse with @xmath5 ( i.e. a system of harmonic oscillators ) , and then decreases again .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is a consequence of the different degrees of phase mixing as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "qualitatively , this effect can be understood by considering the force field inside a shell of matter for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "as expected , systems with @xmath5 do not relax due to their extraordinary orbital structure in which each particle behaves as an isolated harmonic oscillator ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ with the obvious exception of the @xmath5 force , when the systems retain their initial spherical shape , the final states are triaxial . as a rule triaxiality increases for colder initial conditions , similarly to what happens in newtonian collapses .",
    "however , for fixed initial virial ratio @xmath53 , triaxiality is not a monotonic function of @xmath4 : for decreasing @xmath4 the flattening increases , reaches a maximum and then decreases again .",
    "the value of @xmath4 for which the triaxiality is maximum depends on @xmath53 , but it is almost independent on the initial density profile .",
    "remarkably , no models are found to be flatter than an elliptical galaxy of type e7 , independently of @xmath4 and @xmath53 .",
    "+ in general the srsic law provides a good description of most of the final states , with large srsic index @xmath10 associated with large values of @xmath4 ( i.e. for gravity - like forces ) , and with cold initial conditions .",
    "hotter initial conditions and harmonic - like forces produce density profiles characterized by smaller @xmath10 .",
    "moreover the quality of the srsic fit deteriorates for low values of @xmath4 .",
    "+ the differential energy distribution @xmath120 of the final states shows two distinct behaviors , separated by the case @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath120 is well described over a large range of energies by an exponential function peaked at high energies for gravity - like forces with @xmath24 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the final @xmath120 is also exponential , but now the distribution is peaked at low energies ( as in mond simulations , n07a ) . finally , when @xmath23 , very little evolution is found , and @xmath120 remains peaked at low energies .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath3 the trend of the inverse temperature @xmath155 with the srsic index @xmath10 is similar to what found for the newtonian srsic models , with @xmath155 increasing for decreasing @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ we found that the pseudo phase - space density @xmath179 of the ( angle - averaged ) final states is described very well by a power law of radius @xmath180 , over a large radial range .",
    "in general , @xmath164 steepens for decreasing @xmath4 , while at fixed @xmath4 it flattens for increasing values of @xmath53 .",
    "in addition we also found that the gdsai holds ( well within numerical uncertainties ) for all the virialized end - states , and the amount of radial anisotropy tends to be higher for @xmath21 ( i.e. for gravity - like force ) than for @xmath181 .",
    "+ overall the main conclusion of the present study are that several structural and dynamical features of the virialized states of cold and dissipationless collapses are not restricted to the special nature of the newton law , but they appear to be more a property of the long range forces . among the radial @xmath1 forces , however , the gravity - like forces ( @xmath21 ) are those with the results more similar to the @xmath182 force . in addition , we found that the systems with interparticle force proportional to @xmath9 behave in many respects as dmond systems .",
    "in particular , we confirmed that the relaxation time ( in units of the internal dynamical time ) is longer for @xmath6 than for @xmath19 , and this is due to the force becoming more similar to the harmonic oscillator case ( @xmath5 ) when the system oscillates forever .",
    "future explorations , exploiting the similarity between @xmath9 and dmond forces , will be focused on the study of radial orbit instability for @xmath183 forces , in the line of the mond study of @xcite .",
