    "the set of all rotations in @xmath5 forms a group denoted by @xmath1",
    ". we may think of it as the group of @xmath6 orthogonal matrices with unit determinant . as a topological space it has the structure of a smooth @xmath7-dimensional submanifold of @xmath8 .",
    "the group structure is compatible with the smooth one in the sense that the group operations are smooth maps , so it is a lie group .",
    "the space @xmath1 when @xmath9 has a fascinating topological property  there exist closed paths in it ( starting and ending at the identity ) that can not be continuously deformed to the trivial ( constant ) path , but going twice along such a path gives another path , which is deformable to the trivial one .",
    "for example , if you rotate an object in @xmath10 by @xmath11 along some axis , you get a motion that is not deformable to the trivial motion ( i.e. , no motion at all ) , but a rotation by @xmath12 is deformable to the trivial motion .",
    "further , a rotation by @xmath11 along any axis can be deformed to a rotation by @xmath11 along any other axis .",
    "we shall call a _ full rotation _ in @xmath5 any motion that corresponds to a closed path in @xmath1 , starting and ending at the identity .",
    "thus , it turns out that there are two classes of full rotations : topologically trivial , i.e. , deformable to the trivial motion , and topologically nontrivial .",
    "every nontrivial full rotation can be deformed to any other nontrivial full rotation .",
    "two consecutive nontrivial full rotations produce a trivial one .    for any topological space",
    ", one can consider the set of closed paths starting and ending at some fixed point , called _ base - point_. two closed paths that can be continuously deformed to each other , keeping the base - point fixed , are called _",
    "homotopic_. one can multiply closed paths by _ concatenation _ , i.e. , take the path obtained ( after appropriate reparametrization ) by traveling along the first and then along the second .",
    "there is also an inverse for each path  the path traveled in reverse direction .",
    "these operations turn the set of homotopy classes of closed paths ( with a given base - point ) into a group and it is an important topological invariant of any topological space .",
    "it was introduced by poincar and is called the _ first homotopy group _ or the _ fundamental group _ of the space , denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the property of @xmath1 stated above is written concisely as @xmath14 .",
    "this specific topological property in the case @xmath15 plays a fundamental role in our physical world . to the two homotopy classes of closed paths in @xmath16",
    "correspond precisely two principally different types of elementary particles : bosons , with integer spin , and fermions , with half - integer spin , having very distinct physical properties .",
    "the difference can be traced to the fact that the complex ( possibly multicomponent ) wave function determining the quantum state of a boson is left unchanged by a rotation by @xmath11 of the coordinate system while the same transformation multiplies the wave function of a fermion by @xmath17 .",
    "this is possible since only the modulus of the wave function has a direct physical meaning , so measurable quantities are left invariant under a full rotation by @xmath11 .",
    "however , as discovered by pauli and dirac , one needs to use wave functions having this ( unexpected ) transformation property for the correct description of particles with half - integer spin , such as the electron .",
    "the careful analysis showed ( @xcite ) that the wave function has to transform properly only under transformations which are in a small neighborhood of the identity .",
    "a `` large '' transformation such as a rotation by @xmath11 can be obtained as a product of small transformations , but the transformed wave function need not come back to itself  there may be a complex phase multiplying it . from continuity requirements",
    "it follows that if one takes a closed path in @xmath16 which is contractible , the end - point wave function must coincide with the initial one .",
    "therefore , a rotation by @xmath12 should bring back the wave function to its initial value and so the phase factor corresponding to a @xmath11-rotation can only be @xmath17 .",
    "what we have just described is the idea of the so - called _ projective _ representations of a lie group , which we have to use in quantum physics .",
    "as we see on the example of @xmath16 , they exist because the latter is not simply - connected , i.e. , @xmath18 is not trivial .",
    "projective representations of a non - simply - connected lie group are in fact representations of its covering group . in the case of @xmath16",
    "this is the group @xmath19 of @xmath20 unitary matrices with unit determinant .",
    "topologically , this is the three - dimensional sphere @xmath21 ; it is a double cover of @xmath16 and the two groups are locally isomorphic and have the same lie algebra .    the standard proof that @xmath0 when @xmath15 uses substantially lie theory .",
    "a @xmath22 homomorphism @xmath23 is exhibited , which is a local isomorphism of lie groups .",
    "this is the double covering map in question , sending any two antipodal points of @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) to one point in @xmath16 .",
    "the case @xmath24 reduces to the above result by applying powerful techniques from homotopy theory .",
    "there are several more or less easy geometric methods to unveil the nontrivial topology of @xmath16 . among them , a well - known demonstration is the so - called `` dirac s belt trick '' in which one end of a belt is fastened , the other ( the buckle ) is rotated by @xmath12 . then without changing the orientation of the buckle , the belt is untwisted by passing it around the buckle ( see , e.g. , @xcite for nice java applets and explanations ) .",
    "a refinement of `` dirac s belt trick '' was proposed in @xcite where an isomorphism was constructed between homotopy classes of closed paths in @xmath16 and a certain factor group of the group @xmath25 of pure braids with three strands .",
    "this factor group turns out to be isomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "the idea is fairly simple and is based on the following experiment : attach the ends of three strands to a ball , attach their other ends to the desk , perform an arbitrary number of full rotations of the ball to obtain a plaited braid .",
    "then try to unplait it without further rotating the ball .",
    "as expected , braids that correspond to contractible paths in @xmath16 are trivial , while those corresponding to noncontractible paths form a single nontrivial class .",
    "while the method of @xcite is simple and easy to visualize , it has the disadvantage that it does not lend itself to a generalization to higher dimensions .",
    "( a geometric braid in @xmath5 is always trivial when @xmath24 . )",
    "the present paper takes a different , more algebraic approach .",
    "we study a certain discrete ( in fact finite ) group of homotopy classes of paths in @xmath1 , starting at the identity and ending at points which are elements of some fixed finite subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that it is convenient to use the finite group of rotational symmetries of the hyperoctahedron ( the polytope in dimension @xmath4 with vertices @xmath26 ) .",
    "each homotopy class contains an element consisting of a chain of rotations by @xmath27 in different coordinate planes .",
    "these simple motions play the role of generators of our group .",
    "certain closed paths obtained in this way remain in a small neighborhood of the identity ( in an appropriate sense , explained later ) and can be shown explicitly to be contractible .",
    "thus , certain products among the generators must be set to the identity and we get a group defined by a set of generators and relations .",
    "interestingly , the number of ( independent ) generators is @xmath28 and the relations , apart from one of them , are exactly artin s relations for the braid group @xmath2 . in this way we obtain for each @xmath4 a finite group , which is the quotient of @xmath2 by the normal closure of the group generated by the additional relation . when @xmath15 the order of the group turns out to be 48 and it is the so - called _ binary octahedral group _ which is a nontrivial extension by @xmath3 of the group of rotational symmetries of the octahedron .",
    "we may think of the former as a double cover of the latter and this is a finite version of the double cover @xmath23 .",
    "the next groups in the series have orders 384 , 3840 , 46080 , etc . ; in fact the order is given by @xmath29 .",
    "note that these groups have the same orders as the coxeter groups of all symmetries ( including reflections as well as rotations ) of the respective hyperoctahedra , but they are different .",
    "this is analogous to the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath1 on the one hand , and @xmath31 and @xmath1 on the other .",
    "it turns out that the subgroup of homotopy classes of closed paths , i.e. @xmath32 , in each case either coincides or lies in the center of the respective group and is isomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "factoring by it , the respective rotational hyperoctahedral groups are obtained .",
    "we believe that these are new presentations of all rotational hyperoctahedral groups and their double covers .",
    "we will consider paths in @xmath1 starting at the identity .",
    "in other words , we have continuous functions @xmath33\\rightarrow so(n)$ ] , subject to the restriction @xmath34 . because the target space is a group",
    ", there is a natural product of such paths , i.e. if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are paths of this type , we first translate @xmath35 by the constant element @xmath37 to the path @xmath38",
    ". then we concatenate @xmath36 with @xmath38 .",
    "thus , by @xmath39 we mean the path : + @xmath40 for each @xmath41 we denote by @xmath42 the path given by @xmath43 the set formed by continuous paths in @xmath1 obviously contains an identity , which is the constant path .",
    "the product in this set is not associative since @xmath44 and @xmath45 are different paths ( due to the way we parametrize them ) , even though they trace the same curve . also , @xmath42 is by no means the inverse of @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , there are no inverses in this set . however , the set of homotopy classes of such paths ( with fixed ends ) is a group with respect to the induced operations .",
    "further , we will use @xmath41 to denote the homotopy class of @xmath41 .",
    "now @xmath42 is the inverse of @xmath41 . recall that in algebraic topology one constructs the universal covering space of a non - simply connected space by taking the homotopy classes of paths starting at some fixed point ( base - point ) . within a given homotopy class",
    ", what is important is just the end - point and so the covering space is locally homeomorphic to the initial one .",
    "however , paths with the same end - point belonging to different classes are different points in the covering space .",
    "thus , one effectively `` unwraps '' the initial space .",
    "we see that the group we have defined is none other than the universal covering group of @xmath1 . in the case",
    "@xmath15 this is the group @xmath19 ; in general it is the group denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "our aim is of course to show that the subgroup corresponding to closed paths is @xmath46 or equivalently that the covering map , which is obtained by taking the end - point of a representative path , is @xmath47 .",
    "since the full group of homotopy classes of paths starting at the identity is uncountable and difficult to handle , the main idea of this paper is to study a suitable discrete , in fact finite , subgroup by limiting the end - points to be elements of the group of rotational symmetries of the hyperoctahedron in dimension @xmath4 . in what follows",
    "we denote this group by @xmath48 .",
    "( one could perhaps take any large enough finite subgroup of @xmath1 , but using the hyperoctahedral group seems the simplest . )    the further study of @xmath48 requires algebra and just a couple of easy results from analysis and geometry .",
    "we state these here and leave the proofs for the appendix .    by a _ generating path _ @xmath49 we will mean a rotation from @xmath50 to @xmath27 in the coordinate plane @xmath51 .",
    "every homotopy class of paths in @xmath1 starting at the identity and ending at an element of the rotational hyperoctahedral group contains a representative which is a product of generating paths .",
    "each vertex of the hyperoctahedron lies on a coordinate axis  either in the positive or negative direction  and determines a closed half - space ( of all points having the respective coordinate nonnegative or nonpositive ) to which it belongs .",
    "let us call _ local closed paths _ those closed paths in @xmath1 for which no vertex of the hyperoctahedron leaves the closed half - space to which it belongs initially .",
    "local closed paths are contractible",
    ". a closed path consisting of generating paths is contractible if and only if the word representing it can be reduced to the identity by inserting expressions describing local closed paths .",
    "we consider three - dimensional rotations separately since the essential algebraic properties of @xmath48 are present already here and in a sense the higher - dimensional cases are a straightforward generalization .",
    "it is worth recalling some facts about the group of rotational symmetries of the octahedron in three - dimensions .",
    "the octahedron is one of the five regular convex polyhedra , known as platonic solids .",
    "it has six vertices and eight faces which are identical equilateral triangles .",
    "each vertex is connected by an edge to all other vertices except the opposite one .",
    "we may assume that the vertices lie two by two on the three coordinate axes .",
    "we will enumerate the vertices from 1 to 6 as follows : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the octahedron is the dual polyhedron of the cube and so they have the same symmetry group .",
    "the analogous statement is true in any dimension .",
    "we find it convenient to think of a spherical model of the octahedron  the edges connecting the vertices are parts of large circles on the unit sphere ( figure [ octah ] ) .",
    "+    -10 mm     the octahedron has three types of rotational symmetries belonging to cyclic subgroups of different orders : + _ type 1 _ : three cyclic subgroups of order @xmath59 generated by rotations by @xmath27 around the three coordinate axes .",
    "each such symmetry preserves the two vertices lying on that axis while permuting the rest .",
    "+ _ type 2 _ : six cyclic subgroups of order @xmath60 , generated by rotations by @xmath61 around axes connecting the centers of six pairs of opposite edges .",
    "+ _ type 3 _ : four cyclic subgroups of order @xmath62 generated by rotations by @xmath63 around axes connecting the centers of four pairs of opposite faces . + counting the number of nontrivial elements in each subgroup and adding @xmath64 shows that the group of rotational symmetries of the octahedron has order @xmath65 .",
    "as each symmetry permutes the six vertices , it is obviously a subgroup of the symmetric group @xmath66 .",
    "it is well - known and easy to see experimentally that the group of rotational symmetries of the octahedron is faithfully represented as the group of permutations of the four pairs of opposite faces .",
    "therefore , it is isomorphic to @xmath67 .",
    "all symmetric groups can be realized as finite reflection groups and thus finite coxeter groups of type @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath69 and in the case at hand the group is @xmath70  the full symmetry group ( including reflections ) of the tetrahedron .",
    "the case @xmath15 is an exception . when @xmath24 the respective rotational hyperoctahedral group is not a coxeter group . for any @xmath4 however , it is a normal subgroup of index @xmath60 of the respective full hyperoctahedral group which is a coxeter group of type @xmath2 ( not to be confused with the braid group on @xmath4 strands , for which the same notation is used ) .",
    "-10 mm , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] -10 mm    for pedagogical purposes we choose to make a short description of the full hyperoctahedral group as a symmetry group of the hyperoctahedron , which is generated by reflections .",
    "starting with the octahedron in dimension 3 , we see that it is preserved by reflections with respect to planes perpendicular to the vectors @xmath71 ( the six vertices ) and @xmath72 ( the middles of the twelve edges ) .",
    "the vectors just listed are called _ roots _ and they satisfy two essential properties which are axioms for a _ root system _ : 1 ) each reflection determined by a root maps the root system onto itself , and 2 ) the root system contains together with each root its negative but no other multiples of that root . among the 18 roots , we can choose ( not uniquely ) 3 roots , called _ simple roots _ with the following properties : 3 ) they span the whole space in which the root system lives , and 4 ) each root is either entirely positive linear combination of the simple ones or is entirely negative linear combination of those . one possible choice of simple roots is ( see figure [ roots ] ) @xmath73 one can check that indeed every root is a linear combination of these three with either entirely positive or entirely negative coefficients . for example",
    "notice that the angle between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is @xmath77 or @xmath78 , the angle between @xmath76 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 or @xmath63 , while the angle between @xmath75 and @xmath79 is @xmath81 or @xmath27 .",
    "this is always the case  any two simple roots form either obtuse angle or are orthogonal .",
    "the angle between two roots is further restricted by the fact that the product of two reflections corresponding to two different roots is a rotation at an angle linked to the angle between the roots .",
    "more precisely , if the angle between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is @xmath84 and the corresponding reflections are denoted as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , then @xmath87 is a rotation by @xmath88 . since this rotation must have some finite order @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 .",
    "the whole finite reflection group is determined by the positive integers @xmath91 for each pair of simple roots . note that because all @xmath82 are reflections and thus have order two , the diagonal entries @xmath92 always . for the octahedron from the angles between simple roots we get @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . the information is traditionally encoded in the so - called _ coxeter  dynkin diagram _ where each simple root is represented by a node , two nodes are connected by an edge if @xmath96 and @xmath89 is written as a label below the corresponding edge if @xmath97 .",
    "the coxeter ",
    "dynkin diagram for the octahedral group is shown on figure [ dynkin ] .     and @xmath2,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ] and @xmath2,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]    the generalization to higher",
    "@xmath4 is pretty straightforward .",
    "the roots will be all @xmath98 vertices and the middles of all @xmath99 edges of the respective hyperoctahedron .",
    "it is easy to figure out that one can choose the following @xmath4 simple roots : @xmath100 , and calculating the integers @xmath89 , we see that the group has a coxeter ",
    "dynkin diagram as in figure [ dynkin ] .",
    "the groups of this type are denoted by @xmath2 , where @xmath4 is the number of simple roots and is called the _",
    "rank_.    alternatively , the full hyperoctahedral group can be thought of as the _ wreath product _ @xmath101 .",
    "the wreath product in this special case is the semidirect product of the product of @xmath4 copies of @xmath102 with @xmath103 , where @xmath103 acts on the first factor by permuting its components .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath104 and let @xmath105 .",
    "the symmetric group @xmath103 , considered as a permutation group of @xmath106 , acts naturally by automorphisms on @xmath107 , namely , if @xmath108 @xmath109 now , the wreath product @xmath101 is just the semidirect product @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath4 pairs of opposite vertices determine @xmath4 mutually orthogonal ( non - oriented ) lines in @xmath5 .",
    "a rotation in the @xmath51th plane by @xmath27 permutes the @xmath111th and @xmath112th lines",
    ". an arbitrary symmetry can be realized by an arbitrary permutation of the lines plus possible reflections with respect to the hyperplanes perpendicular to the @xmath4 lines .",
    "this explains the structure of the full hyperoctahedral group as a wreath product .",
    "one advantage is that it is easy to see that the order of the group is @xmath29 .",
    "the rotational hyperoctahedral group forms a normal subgroup of index 2 in the full hyperoctahedral group . in terms of orthogonal matrices ,",
    "this is the subgroup of matrices with unit determinant .",
    "note that each rotation is a product of two reflections .",
    "coming back to the rotational octahedral group ( i.e. the case @xmath15 ) , we observe that it is generated by three elements , denoted by @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , of _ type 1 _  rotations by @xmath27 around the three coordinate axes .",
    "they permute the vertices of the octahedron and using standard notations for permutations in terms of cycles ( omitting the trivial 1-cycles ) we can write : @xmath116 obviously , these three elements have order 4 , and generate the respective cyclic groups of _ type 1 _ but they also generate all symmetries of _ type 2 _ and _ type 3 _ :    the six rotations by @xmath61 around the respective rotational axis ( as described above ) in terms of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122",
    ".    the eight rotations by @xmath123 around the respective rotational axis ( as described above ) in terms of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and their inverses .",
    "we consider the discrete group @xmath48 generated by the generating paths @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , treated as homotopy classes .",
    "( we have @xmath131 . ) local closed paths built out of the generators @xmath132 and their inverses must be set to identity . apart from trivial cases where an @xmath132 is followed by its inverse , we have a family of paths for which each vertex either goes around the edges of a single triangular face of the octahedron or moves along an edge and comes back . inspecting all possible ways in which such `` triangular '' closed paths can be built , we see that each one is represented by a word of four letters .",
    "each word contains either @xmath132 or @xmath133 for each @xmath111 .",
    "no word contains twice a given letter but it may contain a letter together with its inverse . in that case this letter and its inverse conjugate one of the other two letters . here is a list of all identities that follow : @xmath134     ( the path traced by vertex @xmath64),width=302 ]    very few of these 24 identities are actually independent .",
    "first , we notice that one of the generators , e.g. @xmath135 can be expressed as a combination of the other two and their inverses , in several different ways .",
    "for example , if we use the first identities in the last two rows we get @xmath136 , from which follows @xmath137    while if we use @xmath138 , and also @xmath139 , we obtain : @xmath140 all other identities are consequences of these three .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 is presented as a group generated by two generators and a set of relations , one of which ( equation [ artin ] ) is precisely artin s braid relation for the braid group with three strands @xmath141 . in other words",
    "@xmath48 is the quotient of @xmath141 by the normal closure of the subgroup generated by the additional relations ( [ add ] ) .",
    "actually , only one of the identities ( [ add ] ) is independent :    [ second]the second identity in ( [ add ] ) follows from the first one and artin s braid relation ( [ artin ] ) .    using artin s relation",
    "twice it is almost immediate that @xmath142 now using the first of the identities ( [ add ] ) inside the expression above we get @xmath143    -10 mm   that @xmath144 follows from @xmath145,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    * note : * as shown by artin @xcite , the braid group @xmath2 can be thought as a group of isotopy classes of geometric braids with @xmath4 strands or as a group generated by @xmath28 generators satisfying what came to be called artin s braid relations .",
    "when @xmath15 there is just one relation ( [ artin ] ) between the two generators .",
    "the geometric picture has the advantage of being more intuitive and providing us with ways to see identities , which can then be shown algebraically .",
    "thus , for example , the proof above has a geometric version which is easy to visualize ( figure [ braiding ] ) .",
    "the same situation will be in place when we consider @xmath24 .",
    "our group @xmath48 will be generated by @xmath28 generators satisfying the standard braid relations plus some additional ones .",
    "using the geometric picture will allow us to arrive at conclusions which are difficult to see algebraically .",
    "* corollary : * _ the group @xmath48 has a presentation _ @xmath146    [ r4 ] the order of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath48 is eight .    using relations ( [ add ] ) we conclude that @xmath147 and similarly @xmath148 .",
    "therefore @xmath149 next , one can write @xmath150 putting together the results in the last two equations we see that @xmath151 and similarly @xmath152 , which imply @xmath153 .",
    "from this we can tell that the order of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is at most 8 . to conclude that it is exactly",
    "8 ( and not for example 4 ) is not a trivial problem .",
    "one way to do this is to perform the todd ",
    "coxeter algorithm ( see e.g. ken brown s short description @xcite ) . if the group defined by a finite set of generators and relations is finite , the algorithm will ( in theory ) close and stop and will produce the order of the group and a table for the action of the generators on all elements .",
    "we used the simple computer program graciously made available by ken brown on his site .",
    "the resulting table showed that the order of @xmath48 is 48 and the central element @xmath154 is not trivial . the results are represented graphically in the so - called cayley graph ( figure [ cayley ] ) where dotted lines represent multiplication by @xmath35 and solid lines  by @xmath36 ( the dotted lines wrap around horizontally ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    we know that taking the end - point of any element @xmath155 gives a homomorphism from @xmath48 onto the group of rotational symmetries of the octahedron and the latter can be considered as a subgroup of the symmetric group @xmath66 .",
    "so we have a homomorphism @xmath156 .",
    "in particular , @xmath157 and @xmath158 . to prove that the fundamental group of @xmath16 is @xmath159 , we need to show that the kernel of the homomorphism described above is @xmath159 , because the kernel consists of those elements of @xmath48 which are classes of closed paths in @xmath16 . in other words , these are the motions that bring the octahedron back to its original position .",
    "it will be helpful to come up with a way to list all elements of @xmath48 as words in the generators @xmath35 , @xmath36 and their inverses , i.e. , find a _",
    "canonical form _ for the elements of @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath161 ( 32 elements ) , + 2 .",
    "@xmath162 ( 8 elements ) , + 3 .",
    "@xmath163 ( 8 elements ) , + where @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "any element of @xmath48 can be obtained by multiplying the identity by a sequence of the generators and their inverses either on the right or on the left .",
    "we are using right multiplication .",
    "the idea is to show that when multiplying an element @xmath160 , which is written in the form 1 , 2 or 3 by any of the two generators of @xmath48 or their inverses , we get again an expression of these three types .",
    "since @xmath166 it is enough to check the above for positive powers .    the proof is a direct verification using artin s braid relation and the identity @xmath167 ( and the symmetric one with @xmath35 and @xmath36 interchanged ) .",
    "thus , e.g. , multiplying the first expression by @xmath35 we get @xmath168 , if @xmath4 is even and either expression 2 or 3 , if @xmath4 is odd .    similarly , multiplying expression 3 by @xmath35 we get    @xmath169 while multiplying it by @xmath36 gives @xmath170    uniqueness is proven by inspection .",
    "let us show as an example that @xmath171 .",
    "indeed , the assumption that the two are equal leads to the following sequence of equivalent statements : @xmath172 the last identity is apparently wrong since no power of @xmath35 can be equal to @xmath36 .",

    "it turns out that all such closed paths are words that are cyclic permutations of the following four expressions : @xmath406 notice that setting these expressions to one gives conjugation identities , e.g. @xmath407 + @xmath408 , etc .",
    "suppose now that the statement we want to prove is valid for all words with length @xmath98 and consider a word of @xmath409 letters .",
    "suppose that the first letter on the right is @xmath49 .",
    "we can move @xmath49 to the left across any @xmath252 with @xmath226 , @xmath410 different from @xmath111 and @xmath112 , as rotations in two such planes commute .",
    "if @xmath49 gets next to a word @xmath411 we are allowed to cancel the two and obtain a word of length @xmath98 and we are done . the possibility to obtain @xmath412",
    "is excluded by locality since anything to the right leaves vertex @xmath111 invariant and @xmath413 sends @xmath111 to @xmath405 .",
    "there are four additional possibilities in which @xmath49 gets next to a letter with which it does not commute .",
    "these are @xmath414 , @xmath415 , @xmath416 and @xmath417 . using the identities following from setting the expressions in equation ( [ triang ] ) to one ,",
    "we replace the above combinations by products of two letters in which the index @xmath111 appears only in the letter on the left . here",
    "are the actual identities that can be used : @xmath418 next , we continue moving the letter involving @xmath111 to the left .",
    "notice that the index @xmath111 may now appear as the second index , so we may need to use the additional identities @xmath419 eventually the letter involving the index @xmath111 will reach the left end of the word and there will be no letters involving @xmath111 to its right .",
    "such a path can not be closed as it does not leave vertex @xmath111 in place . therefore , the only possibility is that the letter involving @xmath111 gets canceled in the process and the length of the word becomes @xmath98 .",
    "now consider a general closed path @xmath41 consisting of generating paths and homotopic to the identity .",
    "in general the homotopy from the identity to @xmath41 need not pass through paths consisting of generating paths but we can modify it so that it does . indeed , if @xmath420 is the homotopy from the identity to @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath421 , @xmath422 , for each @xmath423 we can homotope @xmath420 to the nearest closed path consisting of generating paths , as described earlier in this section .",
    "for @xmath423 small enough the nearest will be @xmath375 .",
    "for some @xmath424 the construction will yield a path @xmath399 consisting of generating paths , such that @xmath399 is homotopic to @xmath425 .",
    "furthermore , the construction is such that @xmath399 is local closed path as any vertex remains in some @xmath381-cell without leaving it .",
    "then for some @xmath426 we will get @xmath398 which is nearest to @xmath427 .",
    "the path @xmath398 is not local but @xmath428 ( usual product of paths by concatenation ) is local . since the words giving @xmath399 and @xmath428",
    "can be reduced to the identity by inserting words giving triangular closed paths , the same will be true for @xmath398 .",
    "proceeding in this way , after a finite number of steps we show that the word for the closed path @xmath41 has the same property .",
