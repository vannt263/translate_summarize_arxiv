    "with continuing advances in instrumentation now enabling detailed studies of very faint and distant galaxies , it is useful to seek efficient methods to find galaxies and clusters at @xmath61 .",
    "one such possible method is to look for galaxies associated with quasars , specifically the radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) which comprise @xmath1810% of the quasar population .",
    "radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) are rarely found in clusters at any redshift , but @xmath735% of intrinsically luminous ( m@xmath19@xmath4@xmath925 ) rlqs are located in clusters of abell richness class 01 ( and occasionally 2 ) at @xmath2=0.50.7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these quasar host clusters typically have anomalously low x - ray luminosities @xmath20 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and velocity dispersions @xmath21 for their richnesses , and thus may be younger and less virialized than optically - selected clusters ( @xcite ; hereafter egy91 ) . in addition",
    ", rlq environments are known to evolve rapidly and differentially . at @xmath2@xmath40.5",
    "only low luminosity rlqs are seen in richness 1 clusters , whereas at @xmath2=0.50.7 both high and low luminosity rlqs can be found in such environments .",
    "a similar effect is seen for fr  ii radio galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "egy91 model this evolution by postulating that galaxy interactions ( more frequent in young , low-@xmath21 clusters ) are largely responsible for creating and fueling rlqs , which then fade as the interaction rate decreases in their evolving , virializing host clusters .",
    "yee & ellingson ( 1993 ) suggested that if the cluster formation rate dropped at @xmath2@xmath70.7 , most quasars we see in rich clusters at @xmath2@xmath40.7 would be old ones fading on the host cluster s dynamical timescale , and that luminous rlqs might be found in rich clusters at @xmath2@xmath60.7 . the outstanding feature of quasar evolution is the sharp peak in space density and/or luminosity at @xmath2@xmath723 ( @xcite ) , but little work has previously been done on quasar environments at z@xmath60.7 .",
    "some rlqs show possible additional evidence for being located in rich environments , in the form of an excess number of `` associated ''  ( @xcite ) or 2  ( @xcite ) absorption systems within @xmath225000  km  s@xmath23 of the quasar redshift .",
    "there is a tendency for associated absorption to be preferentially found in steep spectrum sources .",
    "anderson  ( 1987 ) quote a 2@xmath24 preference for associated  in the unpublished radio - loud survey of foltz .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  3 of foltz  ( 1988 )",
    ": 16 of 22 rlqs with strong associated  absorption have steep radio spectra , whereas only @xmath710 would be expected . as discussed in aldcroft , bechtold & elvis ( 1994 ) , this dependence",
    "is also suggested by the studies of foltz  ( 1986 ) and sargent , boksenberg & steidel ( 1988 ) .",
    "associated absorption systems may arise in gas expelled at high velocity from the quasars or in galaxies in clusters at or near the quasar redshifts . in the last few years",
    "detailed spectroscopy has shown that some associated  systems are almost certainly intrinsic to the quasars , as discussed in the introduction to paper 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it remains possible that a substantial fraction of such quasars reside in clusters which produce associated absorption .",
    "spectroscopic and imaging approaches are complementary ways to investigate this question .",
    "in 1994 we embarked upon a project to study the environments of rlqs to @xmath2=2.0 , to study any correlations between rlq environment and quasar properties such as associated absorption , and to study any examples of high - redshift galaxies and/or clusters found in rlq fields .",
    "paper 1 ( @xcite ) describes our sample and observations as well as our data reduction and cataloguing techniques .",
    "we observed @xmath183@xmath25@xmath263@xmath25 fields around 33 rlqs with = 12 and two control fields with typical 3@xmath24 limits of @xmath8=25.5 , = 20.5 for @xmath2@xmath41.4 , and = 21 for @xmath2@xmath61.4 .",
    "an unusual aspect of our data reduction procedure is the creation of images with constant rms noise from mosaiced images with exposure times that vary from pixel to pixel .",
    "a 3@xmath24 detection thus represents a brighter galaxy at the edge of an image than in the center , but as long as the exposure time is everywhere @xmath2736% of the maximum , the average 5@xmath24 magnitude limit will be greater than the 3@xmath24 detection limit across the entire field .",
    "object detection was done on rms - weighted sums of the @xmath8 , , and @xmath28 data ( where available ) .",
    "photometry was done in all filters using the detection aperture from the summed image .",
    "we use focas total magnitudes and colors determined from focas isophotal magnitudes .",
    "the useful area surveyed consists of 221  arcmin@xmath29 of rlq fields and 19  arcmin@xmath29 of control fields .",
    "our control field galaxy counts ( and color distribution ; see appendix  [ litcf ] ) are consistent with the literature average , but the statistical uncertainties are unacceptably large for our purposes , so we also assembled a comprehensive set of random - field galaxy surveys from the literature for comparison .",
    "one complication arises from comparison with this literature sample : our 1994 and 1995 photometric solutions produce a @xmath0-band galaxy number - magnitude relation n(m ) slightly higher than the literature at bright magnitudes .",
    "given the possible systematic differences between the various @xmath0-band surveys , we conduct some of our analyses using a _ conservative _ magnitude scale ( defined so that our number counts exactly match the literature around = 17 ) as well as our original _",
    "liberal _ magnitude scale .",
    "both scales use ukirt @xmath0 magnitudes ; the only differences between them are systematic offsets : on the conservative scale the 1994 magnitudes ( mostly @xmath61.4 objects ) are 006 fainter than the liberal scale , and the 1995 magnitudes ( mostly @xmath41.4 ) are 012 fainter , for an average difference of @xmath7008 given the numbers of galaxies in each subsample . as seen in figure  [ fig_nmsys2vslit ] , even under our conservative magnitude",
    "scaling the galaxy counts at @xmath119 in 31 rlq fields with good data are higher than those of field surveys ; i.e. , _ there is an excess of galaxies in our combined rlq fields . _",
    "this paper analyzes the excess galaxy population found in paper 1 . in ",
    "[ assoc ? ] we show that there is an excess of galaxies spatially concentrated around the quasars themselves ( see figure [ fig_rpall1 ] ) . in ",
    "[ cmdiag ] we show that the excess does not have the same  color distribution as the field population described in appendix  [ litcf ] ( see figure [ fig_bin1darea_alllibvscfs ] ) . in ",
    "[ richness ] we quantify the strength of the clustering under the assumption it is associated with the quasars and look for correlations between clustering strength and various quasar properties . in  [ klf ]",
    "we estimate the amount of luminosity evolution bright galaxies have undergone in the @xmath0-band since = 12 . in  [ seds ] we compare the spectral energy distributions of galaxies in several fields with the predictions of various galaxy spectral evolution models .",
    "we summarize our major results in  [ conclude2 ] .",
    "some additional details are found in hall ( 1998 ) .",
    "we consider whether the excess galaxies are plausibly physically associated with the quasars by examining the projected radial distribution of galaxies around the quasars and the galaxies distribution in color - magnitude space .",
    "an alternate possibility is that they are intervening galaxies present because they trace large - scale matter fluctuations which weakly lens the quasars , resulting in quasars from radio catalogs with bright flux limits preferentially having galaxy excesses around them (  magnification bias \" ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we observe 134 galaxies in the magnitude range = 14.517 under our conservative magnitude scaling , and 150 under our liberal magnitude scaling .",
    "the average literature counts compiled in  4 of paper 1 predict 120.3@xmath2222.6 galaxies in our survey area , where the uncertainty is the rms scatter among the different surveys in the literature .",
    "thus the excess of bright @xmath417 galaxies in our fields is not statistically significant , and magnification bias is unlikely to be a significant effect in our sample .      if the faint excess galaxies in our fields are physically associated with the quasars , they are likely to lie preferentially near the quasars on the sky . to test this we examine the projected radial distribution of galaxies around the quasars , despite its insensitivity to clusters or groups at the quasar redshift but",
    "not centered on the quasars .",
    "a matched filter ( @xcite ) or cell count ( @xcite ) technique could be used to search for off - center clusters , but would be difficult given the small size of our fields .",
    "however , the galaxy excess over each entire field should still reflect the presence of off - center clusters .    for this analysis we excluded the fields of q  0736@xmath9063 ( uncertain stellar contamination ) and q  1508@xmath9055 ( no @xmath8 data ) .",
    "we took all galaxies detected at @xmath273@xmath24 down to the average 5@xmath24 @xmath0 magnitude limit in the 31 other fields , above which essentially no spurious detections are expected ( see  3.6.7 of paper 1 ) .",
    "we binned the galaxies in 10@xmath5 annuli centered on the quasar and divided by the area imaged within each annulus .",
    "no correction was made for loss of objects due to crowding or incompleteness or for stars fainter than our star - galaxy classification limits , and we do not count the quasar host galaxy . none of these effects should significantly bias the radial galaxy distribution . the results ( figure [ fig_rpall1 ] ) show a clear excess of galaxies within 40@xmath5 of the quasars .",
    "the data at @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 deviates from the level determined from the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 data at the 99.999% significance level ( 4.5@xmath24 , assuming a gaussian probability distribution ) .",
    "we use the reduced chi - squared @xmath30 to quantify the deviation from a uniform radial distribution . here",
    "@xmath31 is the number of radial bins used minus the number of parameters determined from the data .",
    "we use @xmath30 both for the deviation from the literature across the entire field and for the deviation of the @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 data from the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 data .",
    "since the @xmath30 test requires binning and does not distinguish over- and under - densities in individual bins , we also use the kolmogorov - smirnov test , which requires no binning but is less sensitive to differences in the tails of the distributions ( small or large radii ) than in the middle .    to investigate the magnitudes of the galaxies producing the observed excess at @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 , we take all galaxies with @xmath417 and repeat our analysis .",
    "the results are consistent with a uniform distribution .",
    "this is a strong indication that at least some of the faint excess galaxies in these fields are associated with the quasars , since both bright ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) and faint galaxies should be involved if intervening lensing galaxies caused the excess at @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 .      to search for any dependence of the galaxy excess on the quasar redshifts",
    ", we split the quasar sample into @xmath41.4 and @xmath61.4 subsamples .",
    "this is a natural division since the two subsamples were observed almost entirely in different observing runs , and so any systematic magnitude scale offsets will not affect comparisons within them . also , the @xmath61.4 imaging reaches deeper than the @xmath41.4 imaging in an absolute sense as well as relative to the estimated brightest cluster galaxy magnitude at the average subsample . repeating our analysis for low- and high - redshift subsamples with equal numbers of quasars does not change our results in either a qualititative or a significant quantitative sense .",
    "figure [ fig_rphiz_3sigcon ] shows the ensemble radial profile for the high - redshift subsample , which deviates from the uniform level of the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 bins at 99.83% ( 3.15@xmath24 ) significance ( from the k - s test ) .",
    "the data at @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 deviates from the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 prediction at the 99.99% ( 3.9@xmath24 ) level .",
    "the amplitude and spatial profile of the central excess are both consistent with it being composed of galaxy clusters at the quasar redshifts . for the @xmath2@xmath41.4 rlq fields , we plot only objects brighter than 045 above the average 5@xmath24 @xmath0 limit , equivalent to 7.5@xmath24 detections , to ensure uniform detection sensitivity at all radii in spite of different exposure times .",
    "figure [ fig_rpmidz_7.5sig ] shows a possible overall excess within 30@xmath5 , but no excess in the innermost 10@xmath5 .",
    "the overall dataset deviates from the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 prediction at only 65% significance ( 1@xmath24 ) and the @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 data at only the 97% ( 2.2@xmath24 ) level , due to the large uncertainties ( our @xmath41.4 field data is shallower than our @xmath61.4 field data ) .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath410@xmath5 deficit persists even in the complete catalog of 3@xmath24 detections in either @xmath8 or  and is not caused by incompleteness due to seeing or inappropriate dithering .",
    "this deficit may indicate that the @xmath2@xmath41.4 quasars are not centered in any putative host clusters , but excluding the innermost point does not raise the significance of the @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess above 3@xmath24 .",
    "if the @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess is real , the @xmath3@xmath410@xmath5 deficit argues against it being due to foreground lensing galaxies .",
    "the excess galaxies in the central @xmath740@xmath5 radius region can not explain the entire excess observed in our fields . in figure [ fig_rpall_k19.5 ]",
    "we plot the radial distribution of galaxies to a fixed limit of = 19.5 along with the surface density and @xmath221@xmath24 rms dispersion derived from the average published literature counts . despite the large uncertainties ,",
    "there are apparently two components to the excess galaxies : the central component ( @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 ) and a large - scale component extending to @xmath3@xmath7100@xmath5 .",
    "( at @xmath71.5 in our = 75 , = 0.1 cosmology , 40@xmath5 is @xmath70.31  mpc and 100@xmath5 is @xmath70.751  mpc . ) could this large - scale component be spurious ?",
    "the rms uncertainties on the combined literature counts are in good agreement with galaxy clustering predictions based on single surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , so the range shown for the literature should be accurate .",
    "we do not expect many spurious objects above the 5@xmath24 limits in our fields .",
    "we have neglected contamination by stars fainter than our star - galaxy classification limits , but also incompleteness corrections to our fields ( though not to the literature data ) .",
    "if we include both effects , the galaxy surface density is essentially unchanged to = 20 and actually increases ( by @xmath183% ) to = 20.5 .",
    "a simple check of the need for a large - scale excess can be made : from figure [ fig_rpall1 ] , the central excess at @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 above the surface density defined by the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 points is only @xmath710% of the total counts , or 0.04  dex , but figure  [ fig_nmsys2vslit ] shows that our excess counts are @xmath70.1  dex ( 25% ) above the literature average at 19@xmath4@xmath421.5 .",
    "thus a large - scale excess of amplitude roughly equal to the central excess must exist in our fields . supporting evidence for the reality of the large - scale excess",
    "can be found in its  color distribution ( figure  [ fig_bin1dnorm_alllt40libvsgt40 ] ) , which is indistinguishable from that of the excess at @xmath440 .",
    "we consider various subsamples of our data to see how common the excess galaxies are .",
    "we plot the radial distribution of galaxies in our @xmath61.4 fields to various limits in figure [ fig_rphiz_new ] . using the average surface density from the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 data ,",
    "the @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess has significance 99.7% ( 3@xmath24 ) at @xmath420.5 , and @xmath3285% ( @xmath321@xmath24 ) at @xmath420 or brighter . using the average literature surface density and rms , the overall excess ( central and large - scale )",
    "has significance 99.9% ( 3.3@xmath24 ) at @xmath420.5 or @xmath420 and @xmath495% ( 2@xmath24 ) at @xmath419.5 or @xmath419 .",
    "using our conservative magnitude scale effectively moves the literature surface density upward slightly .",
    "the overall excess then has significance of only 9697% ( 22.2@xmath24 ) at @xmath420.5 or @xmath420 .",
    "thus for our @xmath61.4 fields alone , the central excess is only significant if the magnitude limit reaches @xmath3320.5 , while the large - scale excess is only significant if the magnitude limit is @xmath3320 or fainter , and then only under our liberal magnitude scale . due to shallower magnitude limits and fewer fields , the uncertainties are larger at @xmath41.4 ( figure [ fig_rpmidz_new ] ) .",
    "the overall excess compared to the average surface density from the literature is only significant at the 95% ( 2@xmath24 ) level at best , and even less under our conservative magnitude scaling .",
    "we have confidence in the reality of this large - scale excess despite these low formal significances , since the limiting factor in determining the significance is the intrinsically large field - to - field rms of @xmath0-band galaxy counts .",
    "the central excess may be produced by only a few of the fields , but the large - scale excess is not . if we exclude the 5 ( out of 20 ) @xmath61.4 fields with highest @xmath34 , the central excess drops below 3@xmath24  significance .",
    "thus it may be produced by as few as @xmath725% of the fields ( a @xmath35 uncertain fraction ) . however ,",
    "if we take the 15 @xmath61.4 fields which reach = 20 and remove the 5 fields with highest @xmath34 , the resulting overall excess is still significant at the 99.7% ( 3@xmath24 ) level , as measured by both the @xmath34 and k - s tests .",
    "thus the large - scale galaxy excess is not produced solely by the same fields which may contribute most of the central galaxy excess .",
    "at least @xmath750% of our rlq fields contribute to the large - scale galaxy excess .",
    "both fractions may be higher since removing fields will reduce the s / n and significance ( to @xmath43@xmath24 ) even when all fields contribute to the large - scale excess .    only three of our fields might have a large - scale excess produced by very low redshift galaxy associations listed in ned within 18@xmath25 : q  1018 + 348 , 74 from abell 982 ( no published redshift0 ; q  1221 + 113 , 17 from the center of the virgo cluster and 74 from ngc  4352 , and q  2230 + 114 , 55 from ngc  7305 . excluding them",
    "does not significantly reduce the @xmath30 of any fit .",
    "another remote possibility is that faint galaxies associated with the supergalactic plane ( @xcite ) might affect our counts . using ned",
    ", we found the average absolute supergalactic latitudes to be 31@xmath2217@xmath36 for our = 11.4 rlq subsample , 27@xmath2216@xmath36 for our = 1.42 rlq subsample , and 23@xmath2214@xmath36 for published random - field @xmath0-band surveys .",
    "thus even if faint galaxy counts do correlate with supergalactic latitude , there should be no systematic offset between our counts and those of the published literature data due to such an effect .",
    "finally , we examine the dependence of the central excess on various quasar properties using the @xmath34 test . ordering our sample on absolute @xmath37 magnitude and",
    "splitting it in half , we find a 4@xmath24 @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess for the more luminous rlqs ( @xmath38=27.21@xmath220.61 ) but only a 2@xmath24 excess for the fainter rlqs ( @xmath38=25.31@xmath220.77 )",
    ". however , these subsamples have average redshifts @xmath13=1.64@xmath220.27 and 1.32@xmath220.28 respectively .",
    "the central excess is more significant in our @xmath61.4 subsample than in our @xmath41.4 subsample .",
    "thus we can not say whether the primary dependence is on @xmath38 or redshift .",
    "in fact , the apparent redshift dependence may be due to the fact that our @xmath61.4 data reaches an average of 24 below @xmath39 ( @xmath39 is the estimated brightest cluster galaxy magnitude at the quasar redshifts ) , as opposed to 21 below @xmath39 for our @xmath41.4 data ( see  [ calcn05 ] ) .",
    "this is in turn because our 1995 irim data ( mostly @xmath41.4 objects ) has higher backgrounds and poorer seeing than our 1994 irim data ( mostly @xmath61.4 objects ) .    similarly splitting the sample in half at radio power log  @xmath40=27.5  w / hz",
    ", we find a @xmath64@xmath24 @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess for more powerful rlqs ( log  @xmath40=27.79@xmath220.21 ) but only 2@xmath24 for less powerful ones ( log  @xmath40=27.14@xmath220.37 ) .",
    "the average redshifts of these subsamples are 1.46@xmath220.32 and 1.49@xmath220.32 respectively , and the average @xmath38 are 26.20@xmath221.40 and 26.26@xmath220.95 , so this does seem to be a dependence on radio power .    if we compare the 11 flat - radio - spectrum and 19 steep - radio - spectrum objects , we find a 3.6@xmath24 @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess around the steep - spectrum objects but only a 1.65@xmath24 excess around the flat - spectrum ones .",
    "these two subsamples have very well - matched redshift , , and  distributions , so again the dependence seems to be on radio spectrum .",
    "this is supported by the results of splitting the sample between sources with and without strong radio lobes ( types frii or t and types c or ce , respectively , in table 1 of paper 1 ) , subsamples which are 84% and 25% steep - spectrum objects respectively . for strong - lobed sources",
    "we see a 3.4@xmath24 @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess , while for weak - lobed sources the excess is only 2.6@xmath24 .    splitting our sample according to the quasars associated absorption properties ,",
    "we find a 2.8@xmath24 @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess in 13 objects with associated absorption and a 2.4@xmath24 excess in 9 objects with no associated absorption .",
    "these subsamples are slightly mismatched in @xmath38 , but well matched in  and .",
    "detecting excesses around steep - spectrum rlqs but not ones with associated absorption may be surprising in light of the @xmath12@xmath24 tendency for steep - spectrum rlqs to preferentially show associated absorption ( see the introduction to paper 1 ) . however , this tendency is not strong enough and our subsamples are not large enough to show a significant contradiction .",
    "we see an excess of galaxies at @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 from these 31 rlqs compared to the @xmath3@xmath640@xmath5 background level .",
    "this central excess is significant at the @xmath799.995% ( @xmath74@xmath24 ) level and consists of @xmath0@xmath617 galaxies .",
    "it is seen at 34@xmath24 significance in the @xmath61.4 fields , but only at @xmath72@xmath24 significance in the @xmath41.4 fields which are shallower and fewer in number .",
    "the central excess at @xmath61.4 may be produced by as few as 5 of the 20 fields , but it is not due to one or two extreme outliers .",
    "there is an additional large - scale galaxy excess extending to @xmath3@xmath7100@xmath5 detectable in our @xmath61.4 fields with 3.3@xmath24 significance at @xmath0@xmath420 or @xmath0@xmath420.5",
    ". it may also be present in our @xmath41.4 fields , but the larger uncertainties there preclude a detection above 2@xmath24 .",
    "we consider various possible errors and conclude that the large - scale excess is real at the given significance levels , and that it is not produced solely by the same fields which may contribute most of the central galaxy excess .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 excess does not depend on the presence of associated absorption , but seems to be stronger ( 4@xmath24 vs. 2@xmath24 ) for the more radio - powerful rlqs , and may be stronger ( 3.6@xmath24 vs. 1.65@xmath24 ) for steep - radio - spectrum ( @xmath41@xmath270.5 ) rlqs than for flat - spectrum ones .",
    "could the excess galaxies be associated with intervening 2  absorption - line systems ?",
    "this is difficult to quantify this using radial profiles due to the variation in limiting magnitude between fields and the low formal significances of the excesses at all but the faintest magnitudes .",
    "however , we show in  [ n05_summary ] that the 8 @xmath61.4 rlqs with known intervening absorption and the 8 @xmath61.4 rlqs without it show no differences in their inferred richnesses . thus there is no evidence that galaxies associated with intervening 2  systems contribute significantly to the observed galaxy excess .",

    "thus if all this excess was at the quasar redshifts , it would consitute a typical galaxy number overdensity of @xmath714@xmath2210 compared to the model redshift distribution .",

    "we have seen that there is a significant faint galaxy excess in our rlq fields with a color distribution redder than that of the field population . while only spectroscopy can determine the redshift distribution of the galaxy excess for certain , its magnitude , color , and spatial distributions are consistent with it being composed of clusters or other large structures at the quasar redshifts .",

    "thus we use the alternate richness measurement @xmath17 .",
    "hill & lilly ( 1991 ) defined the quantity @xmath17 to be the number of galaxies above background located within 0.5  mpc radius of the quasar and with magnitudes between @xmath52 and @xmath52 + 3 , where @xmath52 is the brightest cluster galaxy magnitude .",

    ", we need to know @xmath53 . also , for valid comparison with results at low , we must account for redshift - dependent changes in the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function ( between @xmath52 and @xmath52 + 3 ) .",
    "hill & lilly ( 1991 ) were studying the environments of radio galaxies at @xmath70.5 , and so originally defined @xmath53 to be the magnitude of the radio galaxy in each field .",

    "in addition , the hzprg population at = 12 does not show much more scatter in the  relation than reasonably expected from studies of dozens of bcgs in clusters at @xmath320.05 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one concern with estimating the bcg  relation from that of hzprgs is contamination of the @xmath0-band light either through scattered or direct agn light or through agn - induced star formation or line emission .",
    "roche , eales & rawling ( 1997 ) examined 10 = 11.4 6c radio galaxies ( rgs ) , and found they have significantly smaller @xmath55-band half - light radii than 3c rgs at similar @xmath2 .",
    "thus the brighter @xmath0 magnitudes of the 3c galaxies are due , at least in part , to their larger sizes rather than an increased contribution by agn - related flux .",

    "a similar excess of @xmath0-band emission at large radii in 3c rgs relative to a sample of mg radio galaxies was found by mcleod ( 1994 ) , who however suggested it may be due to very nearby ( i.e. interacting ) galaxies .",
    "there is also some direct evidence that at least some 3c rgs at @xmath61 lie in clusters , as expected for bcgs .",
    "dickinson ( 1997 ) has spectroscopically confirmed a cluster around 3c  324 at z=1.206 from which x - ray emission has also been detected ( @xcite ) , and deltorn  ( 1997 ) have spectroscopically confirmed a cluster around 3cr  184 at z=0.996 .",
    "extended cluster - scale x - ray emission has also been detected around several 3c rgs by crawford & fabian ( 1996a ; 1996b ) .",
