    "the type - ii outbursts are produced during the episodes of large mass outflow from the be star .",
    "transient x - ray pulsars are excellent candidates to investigate properties of the accretion process that are intensity dependent .    the recurrent high mass x - ray binary pulsar 4u 1901 + 03 was discovered by _ uhuru _ and _ vela 5b _ satellite in 1970 - 1971 which was the first detection of an outburst from this source . a second outburst in 2003 was reported by _ rossi x - ray timing explorer - all sky monitor _",

    "@xcite carried out a pulse profile analysis of this source and found that the pulse profile is luminosity dependent .",
    "a phase resolved spectroscopic study revealed a strong pulse phase dependence of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "in the following sections we present a detailed timing analysis of rxte / pca archival data of 4u 1901 + 03 and report the discovery of several interesting features including flares , a broadening of the spin frequency peak , and a qpo at @xmath00.135 hz .",
    "the hmxb pulsar 4u 1901 + 03 was observed with the rxte in 2003 during an outburst after a long interval of quiescence .",
    "the rxte / pca observations started on 2003 february 10 and lasted for around 5 months .",

    "detailed timing and spectral studies of 4u 1901 + 03 using this set of rxte - pca observations have been reported earlier .",
    "this includes timing and spectral evolution studies over the duration of the outburst , pulse frequency evolution ( galloway et al . 2005 ) , energy and luminosity dependence of the pulse profile ( chen et al . 2008 ) and pulse phase dependence of the energy spectrum ( lei et al . 2009 ) . in the previous section",
    "we have reported some additional temporal studies , including the detection of an intensity dependence of the pulse profile at very short time scales ; probably for the first time in any short period pulsar .",
    "x - ray flares of different duration , occurrence and flux enhancement have been reported in many accretion powered pulsars like gro j1744 - 28 @xcite , smc x-1 @xcite , exo 2030 + 375 @xcite , lmc x-4 @xcite , 4u 1907 + 09 @xcite , vela x-1 @xcite , swift j1626.6 - 5156 @xcite , her x-1 @xcite and 4u 1626 - 67 @xcite .",
    "the extremely large flux enhancements seen in gro j1744 - 28 and the large flares in smc x-1 are probably due to accretion disk instability similar to the bursts in the rapid burster .",
    "the large flares in exo 2030 + 375 and lmc x-4 are similar , and can be caused by rayleigh - taylor instability at the magnetosphere or variable mass accretion from a clumpy stellar wind .",

    "the 1000 s flares from 4u 1626 - 67 are caused by carbon burning under the neutron star surface .",
    "the flares in 4u 1901 + 03 show a spectral hardening , while a spectral softening is expected if these flares had been of thermonuclear origin .",
    "somewhat smaller amplitude flares are seen in 4u 1907 + 09 , vela x-1 and swift j1626.6 - 5156 which are most likely caused by variable wind accretion .",
    "overall , the flares in 4u 1901 + 03 closely resemble the flares in swift j1626.6 - 5156 in their duration , flux enhancement , and spectral variation .",
    "it is therefore quite likely that the flares in 4u 1901 + 03 are also caused by variable accretion , either due to inhomogeneities in the accretion disk or small scale clumping in the stellar wind as is seen in some supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sidoli et al . 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "a significant broadening of the pulse frequency was discovered in sources like cen x3 , 4u 114562 and vela x-1 using exosat observations .",
    "it was proposed that the coupling between the periodic and aperiodic variability appears as broadening in the wings of the spin frequency peak @xcite .",
    "multiple couplings were discovered in her x-1 from rxte - pca observations @xcite .",
    "recently , using _",
    "rxte_-pca observations of several sources , a broadening of the pulse frequency peak has been shown : cen x-3 , 4u 162667 @xcite and ks 1947 + 30 @xcite . for most of the outburst period of 4u 1901 + 03",
    ", we have found a broadening of the pulse frequency peak that we attribute to a change in the pulse shape at a short time scale of a few tens to a few hundreds of seconds .",
    "interestingly , the broadening of the pulse frequency peak and the pulse shape change are absent in the low state when the qpos appear .    over the entire outburst period",
    ", 4u 1901 + 03 showed a variety of pulse profiles @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that some of the pulse profile changes reported in galloway et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at different intensity levels are similar to the profiles shown here , though the former were obtained at different overall intensity level with time difference of several days / weeks and the latter are acquired within a timespan of less than one hour .",
    "this indicates that the pulsar beaming pattern changes from pulse to pulse , depending on the instantaneous mass accretion rate .",
    "quasi periodic oscillations from accretion powered pulsars have thus far been reported from 17 sources including the recent discovery from the transient pulsar ks 1947 + 300 ( james et al .",
    "the first discovery of a qpo in an accretion powered pulsar was made in 1989 , in the source exo 2030 + 375 @xcite .",
    "all types of accretion powered pulsars , i.e persistent and transient lmxb @xmath7 hmxb pulsars have shown low frequency qpo features .",
    "4u 1901 + 03 is the tenth high magnetic field transient pulsar in which qpos have been detected .",
    "in accretion powered pulsars , qpos seem to occur more in transient sources compared to the persistent ones . in most of these cases",
    ", the qpo shows a transient nature . in ks 1947",
    "+ 300 and 4u 1901 + 03 , the qpos are detected during the end of the outburst only while a persistent qpo feature was seen in the transient pulsar xte j1858 + 034 .",
    "persistent pulsars like cen x-3 do not show qpos all the time except for 4u 1626 + 67 @xcite in which qpos are detected in most of the observations .",
    "there are many models that have been proposed to explain the quasi periodic oscillations in x - ray binaries .",
    "beat frequency model is generally considered as the most plausible model for qpos in x - ray pulsars . in this model ,",
    "blobs of matter entrained in the neutron star magnetic field which orbit with the keplerian frequency of the inner edge of the accretion disk are accreted at a rate that is modulated by the rotating magnetic field .",
    "it produces an aperiodic variability at the beat frequency between the pulsar spin frequency and the keplerian frequency ; @xmath8 .",
    "another possible model is the keplerian frequency model in which the accretion disk contains structures that persists for a few cycles around the neutron star and modulate the x - ray flux by obscuration .",
    "i.e @xmath9 @xcite .    in the present source and in some other sources like cen x-3 , 4u 0115 + 63 , 4u 1626 - 67 , her x1 , lmc x-4 , v 0332 + 52 , smc x1 and ks 1947 + 300 , the pulsar frequency is higher than the qpo frequency hence the keplerian frequency model is inapplicable .",
    "it is expected that centrifugal forces inhibit mass accretion if the keplerian frequency at the inner disk radius is less than the spin frequency of the pulsar .",
    "the x - ray flux is proportional to the mass accretion rate , and the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk is related to the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "so in both kfm and bfm we expect a positive correlation between qpo frequency and the luminosity which was however , not seen in two of the sources v 0332 + 53 @xcite and gro j1744 - 28 @xcite    .",
    "so neither of these models are applicable in these sources .",
    "but in sources like a0535 + 262 , ex0 2030 + 375 and xte j1858 + 034 @xcite the qpo frequency depends on the x - ray intensity .    in the 2.7 s pulsar 4u 1901 + 03",
    ", the qpo is detected at @xmath00.135 hz during decline phase of the 2003 outburst .",
    "the same kind of qpo feature was also discovered in ks 1947 + 300 , during its 2001 outburst .",
    "ks 1947 + 300 source has the smallest qpo frequency among all the transient pulsars @xcite . in 4u 1901 + 03 ,",
    "the qpo frequency is less than the spin frequency of the pulsar , so it can be explained by the beat frequency model .",
    "radius of the qpo production region can be estimated as    @xmath10    for the beat frequency model , the keplerian frequency is @xmath11 hz . assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 @xmath12 , the inner radius of the accretion disk is obtained as @xmath13 km .",
    "the 2 - 20 kev x - ray flux during the time of qpo detection is 1.3@xmath210@xmath14 erg @xmath15 sec @xmath16 .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity for the source is calculated to be about @xmath17 erg s@xmath16 at 10 kpc .",
    "the magnetospheric radius of a neutron star can be expressed in terms of the luminosity and magnetic moment as ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the x - ray luminosity in units of 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath16 and @xmath21 is the magnetic moment in units of 10@xmath22 @xmath23 gauss .",
    "equating @xmath24 with @xmath25 we estimate the magnetic field as 0.31@xmath210@xmath3 g. this is consistent with the value inferred by galloway et al .",
    "( 2005 ) by estimating magnetic field strength from spin equilibrium ( 0.3@xmath210@xmath3 g ) .",
    "this is also within the bounds for the magnetic field derived from the upper and lower flux levels within which the source behaved as an x - ray pulsar . in the beat frequency model ,",
    "the expected qpo frequency range , for source luminosity between 5.8 @xmath2 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath16 at the peak of the outburst and 0.16@xmath210@xmath20 erg s@xmath16 when the qpos are detected , is 2.05 to 0.135 hz .",
