    "coherent manipulations of electron spin in nanoscale devices have made it promising to realize spintronics as well as quantum information processing and computation @xcite . in 1990 ,",
    "especially , datta and das proposed a spin transistor in which electron spin can be manipulated by varying electric fields via spin - orbit couplings ( socs ) @xcite .",
    "spin transport have been intensively investigated in various types of such spin field - effect transistors ( sfets ) in associations with spin filters or polarizers , spin currents , spin valves , and so on .",
    "however , the device working performances have not been studied yet much .",
    "even the device performance rates in sfets seem to be much lower than in charge field - effect transistors ( fets ) . actually , for instance , the on / off current ratio is smaller than @xmath0 in a sfet with @xmath1-shaped structure @xcite as well as that in a dual - gate sfet @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "charge field - effect transistors have reached a higher performance rate .",
    "indeed , recent high - mobility fets using zno nanorods @xcite , poly(3-hexylthiophene ) thin film @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , and p - gan / u-@xmath2n / u - gan junction heterostructure @xcite have been demonstrated with @xmath3 on / off current ratios . since spin coherence",
    "can be more fragile than charge decoherence , device disorders may also spoil the performance rate more significantly in sfets than in charge field - effect transistors .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a sfet with high performance rate . to do this ,",
    "we introduce a quantum wire with rashba soc modulations @xcite .",
    "a local rashba soc in a quantum wire gives rise to a spin - dependent fano effect that is the quantum interference of electron propagating through both the continuum energy channel and a localized electronic state resulting from the soc .",
    "due to the rashba - fano effect , electron transmission has asymmetric antiresonance dips @xcite .",
    "further , the periodic soc modulation makes the energy range of vanishingly small electron transmission broader .",
    "this allows us a large on / off current ratio by tuning the soc modulations . even for a strong device disorder ,",
    "the proposed sfet is shown to have higher performance rate with larger on / off current ratio than about @xmath4 .     and",

    "a quantum wire under consideration is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the wire of length @xmath5 is connected to two ideal leads .",
    "its width is @xmath9 , which determines the transverse propagating channels .",
    "the rashba soc is controlled in the gray regions with its length @xmath6 , while the normal regions without the soc has their size @xmath7 .",
    "the number of rashba regions is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "we apply a weak uniform perpendicular magnetic field , which guarantees that landau levels are neglected , in the whole device including the leads .",
    "the zeeman effect splits the on - site electronic energy into @xmath10 with @xmath11 for spin - up @xmath12 and -down @xmath13 . to describe the quantum wire ,",
    "then we introduce a tight - binding hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor hopping : @xmath14 where @xmath15 represent the site in the space representation of @xmath16",

    "it is shown that the gap where the vanishingly small transmission happens becomes wider and deeper as the number of rashba soc regions increases . also , inside the gap",
    ", fano - rashba antiresonances appear to give a much smaller transmission through the quantum wire , which can provide smaller off currents .",
    "further , as the soc strength decreases , one find a high transmission within the gap . in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) , the high transmission for @xmath52 is shown in the energy range of low transmission for @xmath53 .",
    "the high transmission in the gap does not change very much as the number of soc regions increases . then",
