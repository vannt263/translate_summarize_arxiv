    "our main result for amoebas of hypersurfaces is roughly the following .",
    "the precise version is stated and proved in section  [ subsec : hypersurface ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ] ( rough version ) as @xmath46 , the family @xmath47 converges uniformly to @xmath11 .",
    "there exists an integer @xmath48 such that to compute @xmath11 to within @xmath49 , it suffices to compute @xmath47 for any @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 depends only on @xmath49 and the newton polytope ( or degree ) of @xmath10 , and can be computed explicitly from these data .",

    "a point @xmath13 is in the amoeba @xmath8 if and only if @xmath52 is not lopsided for every @xmath53 .",
    "phrased another way , if a point @xmath54 is outside the amoeba @xmath8 , a polynomial @xmath55 may witness this fact by being lopsided at @xmath54 .",

    "if @xmath61 , we will simply say the list is superlopsided .",
    "as before , we also define @xmath62    if a list of positive numbers is superlopsided , it is certainly lopsided ; hence @xmath63 ( see figure [ fig : la ] ) .",
    "david speyer observed that each component of the complement of @xmath64 is given by a system of _ linear _ inequalities , making it easier than @xmath30 to compute explicitly . hence theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ]",

    "similar ideas lead to a method for approximating the _ spine _ of a hypersurface amoeba .",
    "we discuss these constructions in section  [ sec : approx ] .",

    "this a semiring whose underlying set is @xmath66 , but whose operations are given by    * @xmath67 * @xmath68 .",
    "the operations @xmath69 and @xmath70 are known as tropical addition and tropical multiplication .",
    "one can easily check that they satisfy the usual commutative , associative , and distributive laws ; however there are no additive inverses .",
    "a polynomial @xmath71 $ ] is therefore a piecewise linear function on @xmath72 : if @xmath73 then , translated into the usual operations on @xmath66 , @xmath74 the tropical variety associated to @xmath75 is then defined to be the singular locus of this piecewise linear function . a tropical variety associated to a single polynomial @xmath75 in this way",
    "is called a * tropical hypersurface*.    thus there is a simple nullstellensatz for tropical hypersurfaces .",
    "a point @xmath76 is outside the tropical variety of @xmath75 , if there is a single monomial term of @xmath75 which is strictly larger than each of the others when evaluated at the point @xmath76 . in terms of the tropical operations",
    "this term is strictly greater than the tropical sum of the other terms ( c.f . definition  [ def : lopsided ] ) .",
    "more generally the principal results in this paper can be seen of as an analytic analogue of a theorem of speyer and sturmfels @xcite for tropical varieties of arbitrary codimension , also known as non - archimedian amoebas .",
    "we discuss this connection in section  [ sec : tropical ] .",
    "i am deeply grateful to david speyer , for providing a number of useful insights , and in particular for drawing my attention to the existence of lemma  [ lem : averaging ] .",
    "i would also like to thank allen knutson providing feedback on early drafts , matthias beck for answering my questions on ehrhart polynomials , and bernd sturmfels for being particularly supportive of this project and for suggesting the title .",
    "this research was partially supported by nserc .",
    "the idea of the one variable case is simple enough .",
    "suppose that @xmath78 , and for sake of argument , assume that the absolute values of the @xmath79 are all distinct , say @xmath80 .",
    "then    @xmath81    for @xmath42 large , the terms @xmath82 are small in comparison with the other terms and so this is approximately @xmath83 suppose @xmath84 .",
    "consider @xmath85 : as @xmath46 , every term tends to @xmath29 except for the constant term which is @xmath86 .",
    "thus for @xmath42 large , there is a single term in @xmath87 and likewise in @xmath44 which is much bigger in absolute value than all the others .",
    "we now formalise this heuristic argument in a way that will be useful in proving theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ] . at the crux of the heuristic argument",
    "are the following three key facts about @xmath44 :    1 .",

    "this is precisely captured by the next two lemmas . by applying lemma  [ lem : onevariable ] directly to the family of functions @xmath90",

    "the failure is that lemma  [ lem : uniformtransform ] does not hold : the map @xmath615 is not uniformly continuous , and so the uniform convergence does not carry over .",
    "it is most unfortunate that proposition  [ prop : lintransform ] does not easily carry over to the compact case .",
    "the use of elimination theory appears only to be well suited to the study of @xmath51 with its particular standard symplectic form .",
    "in this section we show that theorem  [ thm : generalamoeba ] is the analytic counterpart to a theorem for tropical varieties .",
    "we have already seen examples of tropical hypersurfaces .",
    "tropical varieties in general , can be thought of as a generalisation of amoebas , where one replaces the norm @xmath616 by a valuation in some non - archimedian field . for this reason ,",
    "tropical varieties are also known as non - archimedian amoebas .",
    "let @xmath99 be an algebraically closed field , with valuation @xmath617 . for our purposes ,",
    "a valuation on @xmath99 is a map @xmath618 , which satisfies the following conditions :    * @xmath619 * @xmath620 .",
    "this differs from the usual definition of a valuation in two purely cosmetic ways .",
    "first , a valuation is traditionally given as a map to @xmath621 ; we have simply translated into the operations of @xmath622 .",
    "second , this is @xmath623 times the usual notion of a valuation .",
    "our reasons for making these cosmetic changes will become abundantly clear by the end of this section .    to every @xmath624}$ ] we can associate a tropical polynomial as follows . if @xmath625 , write @xmath626 and call it the * tropicalisation * of @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the tropical hypersurface associated to @xmath627 by @xmath628 .",
    "if @xmath629 , we can assign a weight to every monomial @xmath630}$ ] : define the weight of @xmath631 at @xmath54 to be @xmath632 if @xmath633 where @xmath17 are monomials , let @xmath634 recall that in @xmath622 , a list of numbers @xmath635 is ( tropically ) lopsided if the maximum of element of this list does not occur twice ( in which case the maximum element is greater than the tropical sum of all the other elements ) .",
    "thus @xmath636 is lopsided if and only if @xmath637 .",
    "let @xmath3}$ ] be an ideal , and @xmath638 be its affine variety .",
    "let @xmath639 be the map @xmath640    the following theorem , as stated , most closely resembles the formulation in @xcite , though variants of it have also appeared in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : tropical ] the following subsets of @xmath641 coincide :    1 .   the closure of the set @xmath642 .",
    "the intersection of all tropical hypersurfaces @xmath643 3 .",
    "the set of points @xmath644 , such that @xmath636 is not lopsided for all @xmath55 .",
    "this set is called the * tropical variety * of the ideal @xmath451 .    in fact a stronger result than theorem  [ thm : tropical ] ( as stated here )",
    "is shown in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath106 denote the residue field of @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath645 $ ] , then one can construct an initial ideal of i , in @xmath646 $ ] , corresponding to any weight @xmath647 .",
    "one can equivalently describe the tropical variety of @xmath451 as the set of points @xmath647 such that the associated initial ideal contains no monomial .",
    "thus it is possible to determine membership in a tropical variety using grbner basis techniques .",
    "one can easily see that theorem  [ thm : tropical ] is precisely analogous to the summary given in remark  [ rmk : summary ] .",
    "the proofs of these results , however , are extremely different . an obvious question , therefore , is whether analogous statements can be made in other contexts .",
    "the following is a general context in which one might hope for such a theorem to be true .",
    "suppose that @xmath99 is an algebraically closed field , and let @xmath648 be a totally ordered semiring .",
    "suppose @xmath649 satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath650 for all @xmath651 .",
    "2 .   for all",
    "@xmath652 we have @xmath653    in particular condition 2 implies that @xmath654 for all @xmath655 .",
    "thus @xmath656 is an @xmath657-valued norm .",
    "let @xmath658}$ ] , and write @xmath659 as a sum of monomials . for any point @xmath660 , let @xmath256 be such that @xmath661 .",
    "we define @xmath662 as @xmath656 is multiplicative , this is independent of the choice of @xmath256 .",
    "since @xmath657 is totally ordered , we can define a list to of elements of @xmath657 to be _ lopsided _ if and only if one number is greater than the sum of all the others .",
    "let @xmath663 be a variety defined by an ideal @xmath664}$ ] .",
    "we can consider the following sets :    * the closure of @xmath665 * @xmath666 is not lopsided @xmath667    the question is whether these two sets are equal for a particular @xmath668 . in this paper",
    ", we primarily discussed the example in which @xmath669 , @xmath670 , and @xmath671 , and showed that they are equal .",
    "we have also just seen that this is true if @xmath99 is a non - archimedian field , with @xmath656 as its valuation and @xmath672 .    many ( though not quite all ) of the elements of the proof of theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ] are valid in a more general context .",
    "suppose that in addition to being a totally ordered semiring , @xmath657 is a @xmath673-module ( i.e. we can make sense of such things as @xmath674 for @xmath675 ) ; for example @xmath622 is a @xmath673-module with the trivial @xmath673-action .    define a binary operation @xmath676 on @xmath657 by @xmath677 whenever this set is nonempty .",
    "( we need not overly concern ourselves with the fact that a precise minimum may not exist : one can always get around this by treating this set as a dedekind cut . )",
    "then the triangle inequality @xmath678 is valid ( assuming @xmath679 ) . to see this note that @xmath680 implies @xmath681",
    "; thus @xmath682 clearly @xmath683 which implies that @xmath684    a closer examination of the proofs of lemma  [ lem : goodestimate ] and calculation  [ cal : expderiv ] now reveal that they are also valid ( almost word for word ) for a general @xmath685 .",
    "we can also prove lemma  [ lem : averaging ] in general , by replacing the integral over the torus @xmath686 by a discrete average over a finite subgroup of the torus @xmath687 if @xmath48 is suitably large this discrete average will have the same effect as the integral ( i.e. picking out a single term from the polynomial ) .",
    "in fact we can follow the proof statement 1 of theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ] , up to and including the inequality .",
    "all that remains to show that the right hand side of becomes sufficiently small as @xmath42 gets large . unfortunately",
    ", in general , this is not always true for all @xmath688 ( e.g. if @xmath689 $ ] with @xmath690 if the leading coefficient of @xmath691 is positive , this fails for @xmath692 ) .",
    "it is true , however , for @xmath693 , so our proof of theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ] actually works in the tropical setting as well .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to prove a more general statement , with perhaps some additional restrictions on @xmath657 .    on the other hand ,",
    "our proof of corollary  [ cor : intersection ] , which is the key to theorem  [ thm : generalamoeba ] , is very highly dependent on the fact that our underlying field is the complex numbers .",
    "a very different proof is required in the tropical setting , and it would be interesting to try and unite these two .",
    "in this appendix we give the mundane , technical calculations which are used in the proofs of lemma  [ lem : onevariable ] and theorem  [ thm : hypersurface ] ."
