    "the ut dates of observation are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "nine @xmath9-band orders , with a central wavelength of @xmath01.555 @xmath7 m in the middle order , were obtained using the facility near - infrared , cross - dispersed , cryogenic spectrograph nirspec @xcite .",

    "the keck adaptive optics ( ao ) system effectively reimages the optics , reducing the plate scale by a factor of @xmath011 , producing slit dimensions of 2.3@xmath5 @xmath10 0.027@xmath5 . three ir observations utilized ao in front of nirspec . on all three ao nights",

    "we used the central order , 49 , found at our setting .",
    "this order has three advantages : ( 1 ) it is rich in both atomic and molecular lines and is therefore suitable for identifying spectra of both warm and cool stars , ( 2 ) the oh night sky emission lines across order 49 are numerous and well - distributed , yielding accurate dispersion solutions , ( 3 ) this order has the advantage of lacking prominent telluric absorption lines .",
    "consequently , we did not have to divide our target spectra by telluric star spectra . because the ao reimaged slit width is so narrow , it was not possible to use oh night sky emission for wavelength calibration on the ao nights . on these occasions",
    "we took comparison lamp exposures at the beginning and/or end of the night to determine the dispersion solution and zero point .",
    "based on the expectation that the secondary would be too weak to detect in our spectra , and that only the primary and tertiary components would be visible , we initially derived radial velocities for only these two components of the  system using todcor , a two - dimensional cross - correlation technique @xcite .",
    "the same synthetic template was used for the primary and tertiary stars , based on kurucz model atmospheres @xcite , with a temperature of 3750  k selected in accordance with the late spectral type of the unresolved system , m3 , and zero rotational broadening , vsin@xmath12 = 0 .",
    "the large scatter in the tertiary velocities suggested possible contamination either from moonlight in a few exposures , or more likely by the secondary component .",
    "a reanalysis using an extension of todcor to three dimensions @xcite showed that the lines of the secondary are indeed visible in most of our visible light spectra , and radial velocities were derived using a template for the secondary identical to that of the primary and tertiary .",
    "the moonlight contamination was removed from seven of the exposures using a four - dimensional version of todcor @xcite and the addition of a fourth template appropriate for the sun .",
    "the radial velocities are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] , and have typical uncertainties of 1.7  for the primary , 4.4  for the secondary , and about 3.5  for the tertiary .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of the cfa velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small systematic run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite , already included in the velocities described above . in the case that either the secondary or the tertiary radial velocity was impossible to determine , only the primary star velocity was used .",
    "this resulted in 37 primary , 33 secondary , and 33 tertiary velocities .",
    "the light ratios among the three stars determined from our spectra are @xmath13 and @xmath14 at the mean wavelength of our observations .",
    "the tertiary companion is thus brighter than the sb secondary .",
    "comparison of the visible light spectra to gl 752a , a main sequence star with vsin@xmath12  @xmath15  2.5  @xcite , implies a low , @xmath15  10  , rotational velocity for all components of .",
    "stellar radial velocities were also measured for the ir spectra using a similar multi - dimensional cross - correlation analysis following the approach of @xcite . to optimize the correlation , and thus obtain the most precise radial velocities , the best matching synthetic or observed templates must be used for cross - correlation with the target observation . in our analysis of the ir data we tested three sets of templates : ( 1 ) the  tertiary spectrum , ( 2 ) synthetic spectra , and ( 3 ) observed spectra of radial velocity standards .",
    "the tertiary spectra isolated in the ao observations on ut 2000 jun 11 and 2003 apr 20 provided an excellent template because this bound companion likely shares the same age , metallicity , and surface gravity with the close sb components . assuming a distance of 145  pc to the region , the @xmath00@xmath1621 angular separation of the tertiary implies a projected physical separation of @xmath030  au .",
    "this ability to angularly resolve the subarcsecond , visual companion illustrates a unique advantage of ir observations .",
    "cross - correlation of the ao tertiary spectra against one another revealed no significant change in radial velocity , within the @xmath01  uncertainty @xcite .",
    "thus the tertiary spectra were combined to use as a cross - correlation template with the highest possible snr .    the observed template that best matches the  tertiary ir spectrum is the main - sequence star gl 752a . in a comparison of a sequence of high - resolution ,",
    "near - ir spectra , @xcite found a spectral type of m2 for gl 752a , similar to the m2.5 type of @xcite based on visible light observations ; simbad lists a type of m3 .",
    "we adopt m2 throughout our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the gl 752a spectrum together with the best matching synthetic template and the average of the two  tertiary spectra taken on ao nights .",
    "our synthetic spectral library was generated from atmospheric structures calculated with the phoenix model atmosphere code @xcite and kindly provided by t. barman .",
    "synthetic templates were compared to observed templates by cross - correlation .",
    "@xcite determined the spectral types of a subset of our observed templates ; the corresponding effective temperatures ( t@xmath17 ) were estimated from @xcite . for the observed templates ,",

    "because we derive the radial velocity from the cross - correlation , this t@xmath17 discrepancy does nt impact the radial velocities measured with the synthetic templates .",
    "four synthetic templates were ultimately used , t@xmath18 3645 , 3883 , 4209 , and 4831 k , corresponding to 1 gyr old models of 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , and 0.8 m@xmath19 stars with log@xmath20 of @xmath04.7 @xcite . the t@xmath21 k synthetic spectrum yielded the highest correlation with the   tertiary .",
    "the gl 752a spectrum was convolved with a series of kernels to mimic a range of rotational velocities , as described in @xcite .",
    "the highest correlation with the  tertiary was obtained for @xmath22sin@xmath23 km / s .",
    "however , radial velocities derived with the gl 752a template rotated to other values of @xmath22sin@xmath12 vary by a few km / s .",
    "cross - correlation of the t@xmath21 k synthetic template against the tertiary resulted in correlation coefficients that are @xmath05% lower than for the observed gl 752a template , but yielded radial velocities consistent over a wide range of rotational velocities .",
    "the highest correlation was obtained with the t@xmath21 k spectrum rotated to 24 km / s .",
    "all three types of templates were used to analyze the 2003 april 20 and 2004 may 24 sb spectra , for which the component radial velocity separation was maximum and the sb isolated . using the averaged tertiary spectrum as a template for both",
    "the primary and secondary resulted in the highest correlation .",
    "gl 752a as a template for the primary and secondary produced nearly the same correlation as the tertiary as the template .",
    "however , for a range in vsin@xmath12 s , the most consistent velocities were again found using the synthetic templates . when the various templates were applied to the sb+t spectra",
    ", only the synthetic templates produce reliable radial velocities , similar flux ratios to the sb - only analysis , and high correlations .",
    "testing different synthetic templates to find the maximum correlation confirmed that the t@xmath17 = 4209  k spectrum produced the best match to the primary and tertiary , while the secondary was best fit by the t@xmath17 = 3883  k synthetic spectrum .",
    "@xmath24sin@xmath12 values of 20 @xmath1 1  , 24 @xmath1 4  , and 24 @xmath1 3  for the primary , secondary , and tertiary , respectively , yielded the highest correlations .",
    "vsin@xmath12 uncertainties are the standard deviation of the highest correlated templates for all ir epochs .",
    "our visible light cross - correlation analysis yielded vsin@xmath12 values of @xmath15  10  . because the visible light synthetic templates used in this analysis were created with inherent rotation , rather than through convolution with a kernel function after the spectra were synthesized , we suspect that the lower vsin@xmath12 values are likely more accurate .",
    "we therefore adopt vsin@xmath12=10 km / s for all three components of .",

    "was determined as a function of the fwhm of the correlation peak , and the ratio of the correlation peak height to the amplitude of the antisymmetric noise , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "ideally we would use a three dimensional cross - correlation for all sb+t spectra but the large flux ratios and similar spectral types prevented convergence on a solution . in these cases",
    "we used a two dimensional cross - correlation to fit the primary and tertiary components , then identified the secondary radial velocity as a residual peak in the cross - correlation function .",
    "the three pure sb spectra observed with nirspec+ao yielded an h - band light ratio of the secondary / primary , @xmath25 .",
    "for the four sb+t spectra , @xmath6 was held at 0.55 during cross - correlation .",
    "the 2002 july 18 and 2004 january 27 sb+t spectra were used to determine the tertiary / primary light ratio , @xmath26 , and for cross - correlation of the four sb+t spectra @xmath27 was held at 0.81 .",

    "the template analysis in  3.2 revealed that the observed gl 752a template generally produced the highest correlation for all three components and is best matched to the primary , which we classify as an m2@xmath11 .",
    "cross - correlation using gl 436 ( m3 ) as the secondary template resulted in a higher correlation than gl 752a for the 2003 april 20 sb spectrum .",
    "the secondary was also fit better by a lower temperature synthetic template , resulting in our classification of the secondary as an m3@xmath11 . although the gl 752a and t@xmath17 = 4209  k templates provided the highest correlation coefficients for the tertiary , the t@xmath17 = 3883  k and gl 436 templates were similar to within a few percent .",
