    "linear lepton colliders of the nearest future provide the possibility of investigation of photons collisions at energies and luminosities the same to those in @xmath1 collisions @xcite .",
    "the photon linear colliders have the great physical potential ( higgs ans susy particles searching , study of anomalous gauge boson couplings and hadronic structure of photons etc . , @xcite ) .",
    "and performing of this set of investigations requires the of photon beam calibration as well . for this purpose one",
    "traditionally use some of the well - known and precisely calculated reactions ( see , for example , @xmath2 , @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulties appear in the calibration of photon beams of similar helicity due to the small magnitude of cross sections of the most qed processes .    for this purpose",
    "we consider the exclusive reaction @xmath3 as the possible candidate for a calibration channel on a linear photon collider .",
    "the two various helicity configuration of the @xmath4-system leads to the different spectra of final particles and requires the two mechanisms of beam calibration .",
    "we have analysed the behaviour of the @xmath5 reaction on beams with different helicities as a function of the parameters of detectors .",
    "we have performed the detail comparison of it s cross sections on @xmath6- ( total helicity @xmath7 ) and @xmath8-beams ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the question to be answered is does the process on `` @xmath10 '' beams can have the same cross section as one on `` @xmath11 '' beams .",
    "we have outlined the conditions that greatly restrict the observation of the process on `` @xmath9 '' beams , remaining the `` @xmath7 '' cross section almost unchanged .",
