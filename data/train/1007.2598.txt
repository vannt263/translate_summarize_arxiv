    "indeed the key idea in the proof of theorem c is to show that no homomorphism can restrict to an injection on both of these subgroups . in order to establish this",

    "moreover , dawid kielak @xcite has recently extended our methods to improve the bound @xmath90 .",
    "thus , at the time of writing , we have no good reason to suppose that the lower bound that theorem [ t : nomaps ] imposes on the least @xmath14 with @xmath9 is any closer to the truth that the exponential upper bound provided by theorem [ t : main ] .",
