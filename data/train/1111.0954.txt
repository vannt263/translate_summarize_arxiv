    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are bright x - ray emitters ; their luminosities ( below 10 kev ) range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 that exceed their spin - down luminosity .",

    "their observational properties are explained either with a fallback disk @xcite or by the decay of their strong magnetic field ( magnetar model ) @xcite .    until the discovery of hard x - ray emission from axps @xcite , @xcite and @xcite they were known to be emitting soft x - rays only ( @xmath6 10 kev ) .",
    "the origin of hard x - ray emission is still not well understood .",
    "emission from corona @xcite , breakdown of fast - modes via quantum electrodynamics effects @xcite and resonant compton upscattering of soft photons @xcite are proposed to explain the hard - x ray emission .",
    "construction of spectral behaviors of these sources in a broad energy band is important for understanding the origin of the hard x - ray emission . here",

    "the lat observations between 2008 august 4 to 2010 april 29 with an exposure time of @xmath931.7 ms were used to investigate the persistent emission from . we obtained and analyzed the data from @xmath10 radius around the source and also ,",
