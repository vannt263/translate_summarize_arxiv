    "unlike common engineering materials , living matter can adapt to environmental changes by growing and by actively modifying its structure . when trying to accommodate these features in the infrastructure of continuum mechanics , a key issue is to distinguish growth from strain . beginning with @xcite",
    ", this issue has been addressed through the multiplicative decomposition @xmath0 of the _ deformation gradient _",
    "@xmath1 into a part @xmath2 accounting for mechanically - induced strain , and a part @xmath3 accounting for growth .",
    "the multiplicative decomposition plays a central role in several mechanical theories , such as finite - deformation thermoplasticity and elastoplasticity @xcite . in all these theories ,",
    "@xmath3 yields the local _ zero - stress state _ , and its value at a given point of the reference configuration indicates how the neighborhood of that point would deform if isolated from the rest of the body .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom brought in by the _ growth tensor _",
    "@xmath3 demand additional evolution laws whose choice and interpretation set a formidable challenge . in the format set forth in @xcite the laws governing the evolution of @xmath3 are obtained by combining suitable constitutive prescriptions with the balance equation @xmath4 which involves an _ inner remodeling couple _ @xmath5 and an _ outer remodeling couple _ @xmath6 .",
    "remodeling couples are work conjugates of the _ accretion velocity _ : @xmath7 ( the superimposed dot denotes partial derivative with respect to time ) , and cooperate with standard stress and standard forces to the total power expenditure .",
    "the balance statement , obtained from the principle of virtual powers along the guidelines set forth by germain @xcite , is accompanied by a carefully - tailored version of the dissipation inequality . if the stress respose of the material is elastic , the dissipation inequality is satisfied during whatever evolution process if and only if the self - remodeling couple has the form : @xmath8 where the dissipative response @xmath9 expends non - negative power , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 the _ free energy per unit relaxed volume _ and @xmath12 the _ energetic stress_.    remarkably , the expression of the _ energetic self - remodeling couple _ @xmath13 coincides , _ mutatis mutandis _ , with that of the _ eshelby stress _ , a tensorial quantity involved in eshelby s notion of a force acting on a defect in an elastic body @xcite .",
    "eshelby s original derivation was based on variational arguments , and it took quite a while to reckon as a constitutive statement for a non - standard dynamical decriptor @xcite . yet",
    ", several researchers still contend the mechanical relevance of the eshelby stress , regarding it as a derived object . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is not necessary to invoke the theory of configurational forces to argue that the eshelby tensor has a mechanical significance of its own : genuine variational arguments can be adduced to show that if material structure is allowed to change then standard and configurational balances can not be deduced from each other @xcite .    the literature on three - dimensional continuous bodies which can change their relaxed shape by growth and remodeling is extremely developed , as evident from recent surveys on the subject @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for _ morphoelastic structures _ that is to say , thin bodies , such as rod and shells , which can change their relaxed shape @xcite .",
    "this , despite the fact that models of thin structures , being more accessible to analytical investigation because of their simplicity , seem to be better suited to explain certain qualitative feature of several biological systems @xcite .",
    "when considering a rod , one may ask : 1 ) what decomposition should replace ; what balance statement should take the place of ; 3 ) what mechanical construct would substitute the eshelby stress . when looking for an answer to these questions , one must recall that a rod is a one - dimensional oriented continuum ; as such , its configuration consists of a pair @xmath14 of a vector field @xmath15 and a rotation field @xmath16 defined in one - dimensional domain ( the axis of the rod in the reference configuration ) .",
    "the vector @xmath17 delivers the placement of the centroid of the typical section @xmath18 , whereas the rotation @xmath19 yields the orientation of the same section ( see fig . 1 and eq . below ) . for an _ unshearable rod _ , the case we consider in this paper , @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are related by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant unit vector orthogonal to the section in the reference configuration ( see fig . 2 below ) .",
    "then , one is led to mimick by decomposing the _ visible stretch _",
    "@xmath22 into a _ mechanical stretch _",
    "@xmath23 and , using the terminology of @xcite , a _ growth stretch _",
    "@xmath24 : @xmath25 in order to provide the theory with a non - trivial range of application , we can not content ourselves with . in actual biological systems , not only length , but also spontaneous curvature and torsion evolve with time .",
    "for instance , the change of spontaneous curvature is the mechanism at the basis of gravitropism @xcite , namely , the ability of certain plant organs to attain and keep their vertical posture . in the so - called _ geometrically - exact rod model _",
    "@xcite , curvature and torsion are accounted for through the skew - symmetric tensor @xmath26 where the prime sign denotes differentiation along the axis in the relaxed configuration : @xmath27 observe that , for a standard elastic rod , @xmath28 so that @xmath29 becomes the conventional derivative along the axis in the reference configuration ( which in this case coincides with the relaxed configuration ) .",
    "in order to allow the curvature of the relaxed configuration to change with time , we decompose the strain measure @xmath30 into a mechanical part @xmath31 and a distortion part @xmath32 : @xmath33 and we assume that the free energy per unit relaxed length depends only on the mechanical part of @xmath30 : @xmath34 when comparing with the decompositions and , one can not but notice the addition operation in place of composition .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that the strain measure @xmath30 should be thought as an element of a linear space , rather than of a group . indeed , if we think of @xmath16 as an element of a differentiable manifold ( namely , the _ lie group _",
    "@xmath35 ) , then by a glance at see that @xmath30 is an element of the tangent space at the identity @xmath36 ( precisely , the _ lie algebra _",
    "@xmath37 ) .",
    "we remark that decomposition such as and are standard in structural theories that incorporate anelastic effects .",
    "however , what distinguishes growth stretch from thermal or plastic stretch is its use as renomalization factor to define energy and work densities ( see for instance , , and in section 2.2 of this paper ) .    with and at our disposal",
    ", we recognize the scalar field @xmath38 and the tensor field @xmath32 as the additional degrees of freedom brought in by growth and remodeling .",
    "accordingly , we introduce an _ internal accretion force _ @xmath39 , work conjugate of the _ axial accretion velocity _ @xmath40 and a _ remodeling moment _ @xmath41 , work conjugate to the _ remodeling velocity _ @xmath42 . in order to make our treatment as simple as possible , we neglect elastic stretch by setting @xmath43 so that @xmath30 is the only visible strain .",
    "the evolution of @xmath30 is accompanied by internal power expended by a skew symmetric _ bending - torsion moment _",
    "@xmath44 ( see fig . 3 below ) .",
    "thus the internal power per unit content is : @xmath45 virtual variations of the growth stretch @xmath38 and of the distortion field @xmath32 generate the balance laws ( see and below ) :    [ eq:82 ] @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the ( reactive ) work - conjugate of the vectorial strain measure @xmath48 ( see fig . 2 and eq . below )",
    "associated to shear and extension , which in the present case coincides with the unit vector @xmath21 ( see below ) . in our case , the energetic part the internal accretion force coincides with the free energy per unit relaxed length : @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the balance equation ( [ eq:82]a ) takes the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 , the dissipative part of the internal accretion force , enters a reduced dissipation inequality ( see below ) , and where @xmath52 is the _ eshelbian accretion force_.    the theory we propose should be suitable to model biological system whose geometrical features resemble those of a rod , such as for example plant organs .",
    "in particular , the external forces @xmath53 and @xmath54 may be used to account for physical and chemical stimuli from the environment , which drive growth and remodeling .",
    "their choice depends on the particular application one is being after , and is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "rather , our aim is to emphasize that a state of stress alone may induce growth and remodeling , even in the absence of chemical actions . in order to illustrate this point",
    ", we provide two examples in section 3 . in example 1",
    ", growth takes place at the expense of external work performed by an applied load . in example 2",
    ", growth is induced by relaxation of elastic energy . in both cases , an important role",
    "is played by the _ cost of axial accretion _ : @xmath55 namely , the energetic cost associated to a unit increase of the growth stretch @xmath38 . in particular , it is seen that if this cost is positive , then the structure has a tendency to shrink , unless other material forces prevent it from doing so .",
    "what distinguishes our approach from other treatments of morphoelastic rods is that in our model the laws governing the evolution of the spontaneous curvature and growth stretch are a consequence of a constitutively - augmented non - standard force balances . in particular ,",
    "the eshelbian accretion force defined in provides a possible mechanism for the interaction between growth and stress descriptors . as a matter of fact the notion of material force in structural theories",
    "is not new @xcite . in the small - strain setting ,",
    "the configurational balance equation has already been deduced in @xcite by extending previous work in @xcite . very recently , theoretical insight and experimental evidence has shown the relevance of material forces in rods @xcite .",
    "we identify the reference configuration of the rod with the cylinder @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a plane region .",
    "thus , we think the typical material point of @xmath58 as a pair @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . as in standard rod theory , we assume that the place @xmath62 occupied by this point at time @xmath63 has the following representation : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a vector and @xmath66 is a rotation tensor .",

    "hence , the description @xmath94 of any time dependent field @xmath91 may be provided in terms of @xmath92 through the function @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "] likewise , when computing certain derivatives holding @xmath18 fixed to obtain rate - like quantities , we make use of the operator : @xmath97    there are several reasons for introducing the operator @xmath86 .",
    "one , purely technical , is that when performing integration with respect to the parameter @xmath92 , integration - by - parts formulas hold true if we differentiate with respect to the same parameter .",
    "the other , in our opinion more fundamental , is that it seems to us appropriate to compute derivatives with respect to the content measure when introducing the strain measures : @xmath98 the skew - symmetric valued tensor field @xmath99 accounts for torsion and bending , the vector field @xmath100 for extension and shear .    in order to make our developments as simple as possible , we rule out extension and shear by enforcing the _ internal constraint _ : @xmath101 where @xmath21 is a fixed unit vector orthogonal to @xmath57 . in view of",

    "this result is not surprising : taking into account the _ ansatz _ , and recalling , it is immedately seen that the amount of energy stored in the ring is @xmath238 during the first stage of the evolution process , @xmath239 is small , and hence @xmath240 the _ addenda _ appearing on the right - hand side of are in competition : if @xmath241 , that is to say , @xmath242 , then the _ addendum _ @xmath243 is dominant and energy minimization will drive @xmath244 towards @xmath236 , so that the length ( and hence the total content ) tends to null . if @xmath245 , that is , @xmath246 , then the bending energy is dominant and , in order to reduce the total energy , the curvature of the ring must decrease .    at subsequent stages of the evolution process ,",
    "the spontaneous curvature @xmath239 approaches @xmath244 , so that bending energy is negligible . in this case ,",
    "@xmath247 and energy minimization drives @xmath244 towards @xmath236 , so that the length of the ring tends to null .",
    "in this subsection we expound the main traits of the theory proposed in @xcite .",
    "our treatment slightly departs from @xcite , both in notation and in method , and is more close to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pt . xvi ) , where the large - deformation theory of isotropic plasticity is discussed .",
    "this is not a coincidence , since this large - deformation plasticity has many points in common with the theory of bulk growth .",
    "the point of view guiding the development of the theory is that a continuum theory that aims at describing a certain class of bodies should be based on a _ minimal set of balance principles _ capturing the relevant physics , and valid for all instances of that class .",
    "the difference between material response within the same class should be incorporated into constitutive prescriptions .",
    "this point of view allows a systematic derivation of theories describing the behavior of solids whose material structure may evolve , such as for instance plastic flow , phase transformation in shape - memory alloys and ferromagnetic materials .",
    "due to lack of intuition , it is not always clear what are the appropriate balance principles to be adopted . to this aim , the _ method of virtual powers _",
    "has proven to be extremely useful , as illustrated to a considerable extent in the recent monographs @xcite and @xcite . in order to be applied , this method requires , for each degree of freedom , a specification of power expenditure associated to its evolution . in particular , for a body undergoing bulk growth , it seems appropriate to assume that the external and internal powers have the form : @xmath248 here , as usual in continuum mechanics , we describe the visible motion ( _ i.e. _ , the motion that may be observed at the macroscopic level ) of a body by fixing once and for all a _ referential region _",
    "@xmath249 and by considering a placement map @xmath250 which associates to each @xmath251 its position at time @xmath63 .",
    "the domain of integration in is the typical _ referential body part _ @xmath252 .",
    "a double dot denotes standard contraction between tensors , that is , @xmath253 .    the dot products between the fields @xmath254 and @xmath255 with the _ visible velocity _ @xmath256 yield power densities per unit reference volume and per unit reference area , respectively .",
    "since there is substantial agreement on notions such as velocity and mechanical power , one readily interprets @xmath257 and @xmath255 , respectively , as the _ referential body force density _ and the _ referential traction density_. the latter accounts for contact inteactions between parts of the body , and between the body and its exterior ; as such , is assumed to depend only on the _ outward unit vector _",
    "@xmath258 to @xmath259 , as usual in continuum mechanics .",
    "likewise , one easily identifies the tensor field @xmath260 with the _ piola stress _",
    "@xcite , since this field expends power on the _ referential gradient _",
    "@xmath261 of the visible velocity .",
    "the interpretation of the _ inner remodeling couple _ @xmath262 and the _ outer remodeling couple _",
    "@xmath263 is an issue , since the notion of bulk growth as a _",
    "microscopic process _ is not part of common intuition . yet , their introduction is mandatory if we are to account for power expenditure associated to the _ accretion rate _ : @xmath264 a power whose density we renormalize with respect to the _ relaxed jacobian _ : @xmath265 which delivers volume change associated to accretion .",
    "a link between accretive forces and homeostatic stress has been established in @xcite ; however , this interpretation can be given only _",
    "a posteriori _ , once a model has been assembled and its predictions have been compared with physical observation . at this stage",
    ", we content ourselves with regarding accretion stresses as _ primitive objects _ , just as standard forces .",
    "let us assume that _ external and internal powers be balanced _ : @xmath266 for every pair @xmath267 , regarded as _",
    "arbitrary test functions _ , and for each part @xmath268 . by the application of the divergence theorem , becomes : @xmath269 by choosing virtual velocities that vanish on @xmath259 , and such that @xmath270 , and by a localization argument ( see @xcite ) , we obtain the _ standard - force balance _ : @xmath271 with at hand , taking velocities that do not necessarily vanish on @xmath259 , and using again a localization argument we obtain the _ cauchy relation _ : @xmath272 between piola stress and referential traction .",
    "the other consequence of the principle of virtual powers , namely the _ balance of accretion forces _ : of the spring is the _ force balance _ : @xmath273 involving the _ external force _ @xmath274 and the _ internal restoration force _",
    "@xmath275 exerted by the spring . at this stage , we are anticipating that @xmath18 will be determined through an identity involving two new objects that are not defined .",
    "yet , nobody would reject , being used to forces as _ primitive _ construct , and to force balance as a postulate of mechanics .",
    "the elongation @xmath18 would then appear in the model once we augment the balance equation with appropriate constitutive prescriptions .",
    "for instance : @xmath276 with @xmath277 the _ stiffness _ of the spring , @xmath278 the _ mass _ , and @xmath279 the _ gravitational acceleration constant_. ] @xmath280 is arrived at by localization , on letting @xmath281 be arbitrary .    when looking at and , one can not but notice that there is no coupling between the balance laws governing visible motion and material remodeling .",
    "such coupling is indeed _ constitutive _ : it appears when and are augmented with suitable constitutive specifications relating stress and remodeling couples to the actual motion of the body .",
    "although there is a great deal of freedom in the choice these specifications , they must be consistent with the following dissipation principle : _ the rate of change of free - energy @xmath282 stored in a part @xmath268 must not exceed the power supplied on that part by its exterior . _",
    "since external and internal power expenditures are equal , this statement is equivalent to : @xmath283 what distinguishes bulk growth from standard elasticity is that the free energy density per unit referential volume , besides depending on the mechanical distortion @xmath284 , is proportional to the relaxed jacobian @xmath157 defined in .",
    "accordingly , the free energy stored in @xmath268 is : @xmath285 from , using the identity @xmath286 and a localization argument , we obtain the inequality : @xmath287 then , on introducing the new stresses : @xmath288 and dividing both sides of by @xmath157 , we obtain : @xmath289 on setting : @xmath290 the dissipation inequality takes the form : @xmath291 assume a constitutive dependence of @xmath292 and @xmath293 on the list @xmath294 through functions @xmath295 and @xmath296 , namely , @xmath297 granted that these functions are _ smooth _ , an argument in the appendix of @xcite yields : @xmath298 indeed , let us fix @xmath299 and @xmath300 , and let us assume that for every triplet @xmath301 of a scalar @xmath302 and tensors @xmath303 and @xmath304 , it is possible to realize a process @xmath305 such that , at a certain time @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 substituting into  , and dividing by @xmath310 , we obtain : @xmath311 on letting @xmath312 , we get : @xmath313 since must hold for whatever choice of @xmath303 and @xmath304 , we arrive at .",
    "now , a consequence of is that : @xmath314 where @xmath315 stands for a linear map which transforms linearly tensors into tensors .",
    "consistency with the dissipation principle requires that the block matrix : @xmath316 be non - negative ; the simplest , yet nontrivial choice consistent with such requirement is : @xmath317 with @xmath164 .",
    "then , piola stress and inner accretive remodeling couple are given , respectively , by @xmath318 where@xmath319 by combining the balance of accretion forces with the constitutive prescription @xmath320 we obtain the following evolution equation : @xmath321 as also discussed in @xcite , the main point with is that it identifies a key coupling mechanism between stress and growth irrespective of the choice of free - energy and dissipation .",
    "of course , _ additional coupling mechanisms _ may be introduced in the model : for instance , through the outer remodeling couple @xmath263 .",
    "indeed the modifier _",
    "`` outer '' _ , for the remodeling couple @xmath263 refers to the fact that its working is not accounted for in the dissipation principle and hence stands outside the thermodynamic structure of the theory .",
    "yet , @xmath263 needs not be ascribed solely to agents outside the body , and may well depend on processes that take place _ within the body_.    the theory of bulk growth and the theory of plastic solids undergoing large deformations have many common traits .",
    "both are based on the decomposition .",
    "however , in the latter theory @xmath322 is interpreted as the _ plastic - distortion tensor _ .. ] since plastic flow is not accompanied by appreciable volume changes , plastic distortion is _ isochoric _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 91.1 ) ) : @xmath323 as a consequence @xmath324 is _ deviatoric _ : @xmath325 and a balance similar to that of accretion forces holds , but only for the deviatoric parts ( here denoted with a subscript @xmath326 as in @xcite ) of the relevant microscopic stresses : @xmath327 more importantly , because of , the term @xmath328 disappears from the dissipation inequality , which then reads : @xmath329 in particular , is replaced by @xmath330 thus , the balance equation can be written as : @xmath331 notice that , on denoting by @xmath332 the cauchy stress , we have @xmath333 , whence : , we have also @xmath334 , whence @xmath335 ] @xmath336 thus , by a comparison with eq .",
    "( 94.12 ) of @xcite , we see that @xmath337 becomes the _",
    "mandel stress _ , a tensorial quantity that , in finite plasticity , conveys the interaction between stress and plastic flow .",
    "the analogy between bulk growth and plastic distortion suggests two ways of modifying the thery of three - dimensional bulk growth presented in this section .",
    "first , one may replace the smooth constitutive equation for @xmath293 with an inclusion of the form : @xmath338 where @xmath339 is a possibly _ nonsmooth _ dissipation potential such that @xmath340 , and @xmath341 is its subdifferential set at @xmath324 .",
    "non - smooth dissipation potentials are customary in the mathematical modeling of materials that display hysteresis @xcite , for instance , in the modeling of shape memory alloys @xcite and ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "of course , the argument following would not apply in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the dissipation inequality would still hold .",
    "such modification would likely introduce hysteresis effects and , moreover , would provide a remedy to a limitation pointed out in @xcite .",
    "namely , that a growing body under constant external load never reaches a stationary configuration .",
    "second , it is known that the inclusion of the gradient of plastic strain in the internal power expenditure @xcite leads to models that can replicate size dependent resistance to plastic flow observed for instance in torsion experiments @xcite as confirmed by recent analytical results @xcite .",
    "we therefore argue that the inclusion , in the expression of the internal power , of a term accounting for power expenditure associated the gradient of the accretion velocity would lead to interesting size - dependent interaction between stress and growth .",
    "the application of the principle of virtual powers to derive balance equations appropriate to rod theories is substantially simplified by using machinery and concepts from the theory of lie groups , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "as explained in section 2.1 , a rod is regared as a one - dimensional collection of sections , labeled through a parameter @xmath18 in an open interval which , for lack of a better choice , we take to be @xmath342 . accordingly",
    ", the motion of a rod may be represented through a function @xmath343 where @xmath344 is the lie group ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) ) of _ rigid - body motions _ ,",
    "i.e. , orientation - preserving isometries of the three - dimensional euclidean point space . on choosing a pole @xmath124 and on orthonormal basis , one may think of any such isometry as a rotation keeping @xmath124 fixed , represented through a rotation matrix @xmath66 , followed by a translation @xmath65 , in the manner prescribed by .",
    "when doing calculations on the group @xmath344 , it is useful to identify its typical element @xmath345 with a @xmath346 matrix , which in block - matrix notation can be rendered as : @xmath347 so that composition between rigid - body motions can be computed by performing matrix multiplication . by doing so , one easily finds that the inverse of @xmath345 has the representation : @xmath348    the velocity of a particular section @xmath18 at a given time @xmath63 : @xmath349 is an element of @xmath350 , the tangent space at @xmath351 .",
    "consider now two sections , say @xmath352 and @xmath353 . in general , we shall have @xmath354 , thus the velocities of section @xmath352 and section @xmath353 are elements of distinct tangent spaces . in order to compare these velocities , we need to transport the corresponding tangent vectors in the tangent space of the same point .",
    "it is then natural to choose this point as the identity @xmath355 .",
    "one method to pull the velocity vector @xmath356 back to the identity is by _ right - composition _ with @xmath357 . in order to define this operation ,",
    "we consider the curve @xmath358 at @xmath359 this curve goes through @xmath360 . accordingly , its derivative at @xmath359 , which we refer to as the _ right velocity _ : @xmath361 is an element of @xmath362 , the tangent space at @xmath360 .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath83 is a skew - symmetric tensor ( as can be verified by differentiating the identity @xmath363 ) .",
    "consequently , there exists a unique vector @xmath364 , the _ axial vector of @xmath83 _ , such that @xmath365 for every vector @xmath21 .",

    "let us consider the curve : @xmath371 again , this curve goes through @xmath360 at @xmath372 .",
    "hence , its derivative at @xmath372 , namely , @xmath373 is a tangent vector at @xmath360 .",
    "if we replace differentiation with respect to @xmath18 with differentiation with respect to the content measure @xmath92 , defined in , then we obtain the _ right strain _ : @xmath374    another way to pull tangent vectors back to the identity is by _",

    "its derivative at @xmath372 : @xmath376 is a tangent vector at @xmath360 .",

    "it is exactly because of this term that the balance equation governing accretion contains contributions from the standard internal forces .",
    "the power expended by the applied loads on a part @xmath388 has the representation : @xmath389 , where @xmath390 with @xmath78 a skew - symmetric tensor and @xmath79 a vector .",
    "the axial vector of @xmath391 represents the external moment per unit content applied at @xmath18 at time @xmath63 , resolved with respect to the fixed pole @xmath124 . for this , reason",
    ", we can refer to @xmath78 as a couple .",
    "the vector @xmath392 is the external force per unit content applied at @xmath18 at time @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to the external couple @xmath78 and the external force @xmath79 , the part @xmath76 experiences an internal couple and an internal force transmitted by the rest of the body .",
    "we assume that these mechanical actions are conveyed by a pair of fields @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "the values of @xmath395 and @xmath396 at @xmath397 yield , respectively , the internal couple and the internal force exerted by @xmath398 on @xmath76 . likewise ,",
    "the values of @xmath399 and @xmath400 at @xmath401 yield , respectively , the internal couple and the internal force exerted by @xmath402 on @xmath76 .",
    "we therefore write the external power expended on @xmath76 as : @xmath403=\\int_a^b \\big({\\bm{\\mathsf{b}}}\\cdot{\\bm{\\mathsf{w}}}+{{\\mathbf b_{\\rm d}}}\\cdot{\\dot{\\mathbf u}_{\\rm d}}+b\\mathring\\lambda\\big)\\,{\\rm d}s+{\\bm{\\mathsf{t}}}^+(b)\\cdot{\\bm{\\mathsf{w}}}(b)+{\\bm{\\mathsf{t}}}^-(a)\\cdot{\\bm{\\mathsf{w}}}(a)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the dot product between skew tensors is defined by @xmath404 where @xmath405 is the standard scalar product between second - order tensors .",
