    "significant improvements in the understanding of the decay and interaction of charged kaons are expected from the approved experiments @xcite @xcite at the frascati @xmath0 factory @xcite .    in this context , a measurement of muon polarization in the semileptonic decay @xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) would be very interesting .",
    "in fact , the component of the muon polarization transverse to the decay plane is sensitive to possible violation of time reversal ( t ) invariance , as first noticed by sakurai @xcite .",
    "the transverse muon polarization @xmath10 in which @xmath11 is the muon spin vector , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the muon and neutral pion momenta , changes sign under the t - reversal operation .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath14 would evidentiate a t violation .    in the standard model , where cp violation is introduced with an imaginary phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements @xcite",
    ", @xmath14 is expected to be very small ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "also , the presence of electromagnetic interaction ( even if t invariant ) in the final state can produce a non - zero @xmath14 , estimated to be @xmath16 for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , the measurement of a non - zero value ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath14 would be a definite sign of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "on the other hand , there are several models @xcite @xcite containing charged higgs particles or other non - standard scalar interactions like lepto - quarks that do not violate existing experimental constraints from the neutron dipole moment and @xmath18 and allow a transverse muon polarization as large as @xmath19 .",
    "the magnitude of the other two components of the muon polarization is determined by the form factors describing the decay @xmath1 .",
    "a precise measurement of the total muon polarization would allow the verification of predictions of the modern chiral symmetry theory @xcite .    in this paper , the feasibility of an experiment for t invariance in kaon decay ( etika ) at a @xmath0 factory is analysed .",
    "section [ theor ] is devoted to the description of the theoretical framework of the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the achievable accuracy of the muon polarization measurement at a @xmath0 factory is analysed in section [ stat ] . in section [ phifact ]",
    "the essential properties and requirements of the etika experiment are discussed .",
    "other physics topics are presented in section [ phtpo ] .",
    "lastly , the conclusions are given .",
    "in the usual v - a theory of the @xmath9 decay , the matrix element governing the decay is proportional to @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 is the strangeness - changing hadronic current .",
    "the hadronic vertex associated to the current is a function of three four - vectors , only two of which are independent by energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the combinations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are usually chosen as basis vectors , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the kaon and pion four - vectors , respectively .",
    "also , there is only one independent scalar , apart from the kaon and pion masses , which can be formed from the basis vectors .",
    "it is usually chosen to be @xmath26 .",
    "being @xmath20 a four - vector which represents the hadronic vertex , it must be expressible as a linear combination of the basis vectors , with coefficients at most depending on @xmath27 .",
    "the standard expression is @xmath28 in this formalism , all experimental quantities except absolute rates can be written as a function of only one complex parameter @xmath29 given by the ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath31 . the dalitz plot density in the kaon rest frame and @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "will be used in the following . ]",
    "is then given by @xcite @xmath35 in which @xmath36 in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the energy and mass of particle @xmath39 .",
    "the dalitz plot density of the @xmath1 decay , corresponding to equation ( [ for : dalitz ] ) and the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite values @xmath40 and @xmath41 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitz ] .",
    "expressions for the muon polarization in @xmath9 decays have been given by several authors @xcite .",
    "since the neutrino from the decay has unit elicity , the muon moving with a given angle and momentum relative to the neutrino has a unique spin orientation . in the k rest frame , the muon polarization is then a unit vector whose components are uniquely specified by the decay kinematics . the expression given by cabibbo and maksymowics @xcite for the muon polarization in the kaon rest frame is @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 + \\vec{p_\\pi } \\right]+m_k im\\xi ( \\vec{p_\\pi}\\times\\vec{p_\\mu } ) , \\label{eq : pol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 \\nonumber \\\\ a_2(\\xi ) & = & m_k^2 + 2reb(q^2)m_ke_\\mu+|b(q^2)|^2 m_\\mu^2 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b(q^2 ) & = & \\frac{\\xi(q^2)-1}{2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the momenta of the muon and pion , respectively , in the kaon rest frame .",
    "notice that @xmath47 .",
    "having measured the kinematics of an event ( _ i.e. _ the four - vectors @xmath48 and @xmath25 ) , the actual value of @xmath49 is determined by @xmath50 . in particular",
    ", for each event a reference frame can be defined having axes @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the longitudinal component of the muon polarization in this reference frame is then @xmath53 , the perpendicular component is @xmath54 and the transverse component is @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath14 component is exactly the t - odd observable identified in equation ( [ eq : pt ] ) . according to equation ( [ eq : pol ] ) ,",
    "@xmath14 is proportional to @xmath56 , and if t invariance is conserved one expects @xmath14 to be zero . on the other hand , the @xmath57 and @xmath14 components are sensitive to @xmath4 .",
    "the values averaged over the dalitz plot are @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    from the experimental point of view , it is important to identify the regions of the dalitz plot where the best sensitivity to @xmath50 is obtained from the measurement of the muon polarization .",
    "for example , one can use the variation of the polarization @xmath61 in a given point of the dalitz plot ( @xmath62 ) for a fixed change of @xmath4 or @xmath56 . since the error on the measurement of a polarization scales as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of events in the point ( @xmath62 ) of the dalitz plot , the ratio @xmath65 is a good estimator of the sensitivity .",
    "a measure of the sensitivity to @xmath56 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "a measure of the sensitivity to @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the component of the muon polarization lying on the decay plane .",
    "the sensitivity over the dalitz plot is almost identical for the two cases , and contour lines corresponding to this estimator are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : senspolt ] .",
    "it is clear that the best sensitivity to both @xmath70 and @xmath67 is obtained in the region of low @xmath34 energy and high @xmath71 energy .",
    "however , the sensitivity to @xmath50 is still significant over most of the dalitz plot area , allowing a non - critical definition of the experimental acceptance .",
    "the da@xmath72ne @xmath0 factory is expected to collide @xmath73 beams with a luminosity of , which corresponds to @xmath74 produced in a year of @xmath75 seconds .",
    "thus , @xmath76 from the @xmath0 decay will be produced in one year of running . assuming a branching ratio of @xmath77 @xcite for @xmath9 , a number @xmath78 of @xmath1 will be available . in order to measure the muon polarization ,",
    "the subsequent spin analysing decay @xmath79 must be used .",
    "after integration over the positron energy spectrum , the decay angular distribution in the muon rest frame is : @xmath80 in which @xmath81 is the muon polarization , and @xmath82 is the cosinus of the angle between the polarization unit vector @xmath83 and the unit vector along the positron momentum .",
    "an estimate of the error on the muon polarization obtained using the polarization sensitivity of equation ( [ eq : mudec ] ) is given by @xcite : @xmath84^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } =   \\frac{1}{s\\sqrt{n}}.   \\label{eq : sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example , in the case of the t violating polarization @xmath14 , which is @xmath85 , @xmath86 and the expected error is : @xmath87 similar errors are also expected for the @xmath57 and @xmath88 components",
    ".    it should be noticed that an improved sensitivity is obtained if the full @xmath89 distribution is used , once appropriate cuts on the positron energy @xmath90 and angle are applied . in fact , it can be shown @xcite that @xmath91 can be as large as 0.26 , thus reducing the error quoted in equation ( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) to @xmath92 .",
    "the best existing measurement of @xmath14 @xcite is consistent with zero with an error of @xmath93 .",
    "measurement of @xmath57 and @xmath88 are quite old @xcite and have large errors .",
    "an error @xmath94 would represent a factor ten improvement on the sensitivity to t violating effect in @xmath9 .",
    "also , it corresponds to a precise measurement of @xmath4 , with an error @xmath95 , through the @xmath57 and @xmath88 components . in order to reach such precision ,",
    "the overall acceptance of the etika experiment at the @xmath0 factory should be in the range of @xmath96 ( depending on the actual value of @xmath91 ) , which includes the fraction of accepted @xmath97 from the @xmath0 decay , the efficiency of reconstructing the @xmath1 decay , and the acceptance over the spin analysing decay @xmath79 .",
    "if a luminosity of @xmath98@xmath99sec@xmath100 should be reached , the quoted errors will improve by a factor @xmath101 .",
    "alternatively , the overall acceptance needed to reach a precision of @xmath102 would reduce to @xmath103 .",
    "the measurement of the muon polarization is performed with the standard technique of stopping the positive muons in a non - depolarizing material , like carbon or aluminium , and then observing the asymmetry in the angular distribution of the positrons from the @xmath104 decay .",
    "it should be noted that the decay @xmath105 allows in principle also the study of @xmath106 , when the @xmath107 decay is observed in flight . however , stopped negative muons are rapidly captured in atomic orbits and almost completely depolarized .",
    "thus , the @xmath106 decay can not be used for the measurement of the muon polarization in charged kaon semileptonic decays , and the etika experiment must be able to distinguish between @xmath97 and @xmath107 decay products .    a possible solution is the kaon charge identification by tracking particles curvature in a magnetic field . on the other hand , the presence of a magnetic field will cause the spin of stopped muons to precess .",
    "the net effect will be a significant reduction of the sensitivity , with a corresponding increase by a factor of three of the expected error @xmath108 given by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of radial components of the field which are typically at the level of a few gauss can introduce systematic effects which are difficult to control .",
    "the polarization analyser could be placed in a magnetic shield , but , due to the high value of the magnetic field ( 0.5 - 1 tesla ) , the level of 0.1 gauss inside the shield needed to reduce the systematic uncertainties would be hardly reachable @xcite . in conclusion , this approach looks very difficult and , even if feasible , complicated and costly .",
    "a different experimental method is proposed , based on stopping charged kaons in a target surrounding the @xmath109 interaction point , which provides a good acceptance with detectors of reasonable dimensions and the separation of @xmath97 and @xmath107 without a magnetic field .",
    "charged kaon pairs produced at the da@xmath72ne @xmath0 factory will have @xmath11016 mev kinetic energy , and stop in about 0.5 g/@xmath111 thickness of material . as a matter of fact",
    ", a carbon target surrounding the da@xmath72ne beam pipe is the key element for the study of hypernuclear states proposed by the finuda @xcite experiment . a schematic picture of the etika experiment is shown in fig .",
    "the beryllium beam pipe is surrounded by @xmath0 segmented scintillators which represent the active target . a positively charged kaon stops into the scintillator target , and its subsequent decays can then be observed . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath107 brought to rest into the target suffers nuclear capture , giving rise to characteristic `` stars '' from nuclear evaporation .",
    "low energy heavy fragments , @xmath112 and @xmath113 particles emitted in the process of @xmath107 absorption give distinct signals in scintillators and tracking detectors placed around the target , when compared with the single muon track coming from the @xmath97 decay . also , the prompt signal ( @xmath114 lifetime ) from the products of @xmath107 absorption can be used to efficiently tag the @xmath97 decay having a 12 ns lifetime . the energy deposited in the target scintillators by the charged kaons and the back to back topology of the @xmath8 events",
    "is used for the first level trigger of the experiment .",
    "also , a tracking detector is placed between the scintillator target and the beam pipe , in order to precisely determine the @xmath97 stopping point into the target .",
    "low mass tracking chambers are placed between the target scintillators and the polarization analyser in order to measure precisely the @xmath71 direction of flight .",
    "the polarization analyser detector , in its simplest configuration , is composed by layers of non - depolarysing absorber , interleaved by tracking detector planes , which track the muon and determine its range and also measure the positron from the @xmath2 decay .",
    "a resolution of @xmath115 mev on the muon energy is obtained on the basis of the stopping layer by using thin absorbers ( for example 5 mm thick carbon layers ) .",
    "photons from the @xmath34 decay are reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( not shown in fig .",
    "3 ) placed around the polarization analyser detector . the etika detector would fit in a cylinder of @xmath115 m diameter and @xmath115 m length .",
    "a simulation @xcite , in which the polarization analyser is formed by 70 carbon layers with 5 mm thickness , showed that an overall acceptance @xmath116 can be obtained .",
    "it is clear that this value for the efficiency @xmath117 is only a reasonable estimate , and a detailed monte carlo simulation of the individual detectors is needed in order to be more precise .",
    "nevertherless , this estimate of the acceptance is well within the range quoted in section  [ stat ] ( @xmath118 ) , and it shows that an error @xmath94 on the t violating muon polarization is achievable with the experimental method proposed .",
    "the effect of detectors resolutions was estimated by a monte carlo simulation .",
    "energy and angular resolutions were chosen on the basis of the performances of available detector techniques .",
    "in particular , a resolution of 10 mrad was assumed for both the polar ( @xmath119 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath0 ) angle reconstruction of positive muons , together with 3 mev resolution in energy . @xmath120 and",
    "a granularity corresponding to 20 mrad angular resolution in @xmath119 and @xmath0 was taken for the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the direction of photons interacting in the polarization analyser was assumed to be reconstructed with 70 mrad precision on both angles .",
    "the resolution on the positron direction was taken to be 120 mrad in @xmath119 and @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation showed that detector resolutions and the procedure of reconstruction of the @xmath1 kinematics do not spoil the sensitivity to the polarization measurement and do not introduce significant systematic effects .",
    "a large part of the systematic uncertainties on the muon polarization measurement can be estimated from the data themselves .",
    "for example , the decay @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) provides a copious source of monoenergetic muons , which will be univoquely identified by their long range into the polarization analyser .",
    "the characteristics of @xmath107 interaction into the target will be precisely determined looking at the detector signals in events tagged by a decay .",
    "also , these events allow a calibration of the muon polarization measurement , since muons from the @xmath122 decay have @xmath123 and zero transverse components , and any systematic effect will show up in the polarization sensitive positron angular distribution .",
    "the identification and kinematics recontruction of the @xmath34 from the @xmath1 decay can be studied with the two - body decay @xmath124 , which features a monoenergetic @xmath125 and two photons reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter or polarization analyser .",
    "the energies of the photons can be predicted by applying momentum conservation , the photons directions being measured by the detectors .",
    "this will allow a calibration of the detectors energy response to photons .",
    "also , the procedure of kinematics reconstruction of events in which one photon is measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the other photon is measured in the polarization analyser will be tested .",
    "background events in the sample of @xmath1 candidates come mainly from other @xmath97 decays .",
    "in fact , a pion stopping in the range detector will decay into a muon of 4 mev kinetic energy , which will stop typically in the same layer where the originating pion stopped , and then decay through @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath124 or ( in which two of the photons coming from the decays of the neutral pions are not reconstructed ) will mimic a @xmath1 event",
    ". however , these events can be in large part rejected by kinematics constraints and requirements on the momentum of the observed particles . in any case ,",
    "expected backgrounds will at most reduce the sensitivity to the muon polarization measurement , but they do not produce any significant spurious component of the polarization .    the presence of a magnetic field can introduce systematic effects in the polarization measurement .",
    "in fact , the muon polarization will precess around the field , generating spurious components of the polarization .",
    "the expected effects in the case of the etika experiment are small , since , given the presence of a magnetic field along a fixed direction , the muon polarization of muons from the @xmath1 decay will be isotropically distributed around this direction , and any spurious component will tend to cancel .",
    "this statement was checked with a monte carlo simulation , which showed that enclosing the etika detector in a magnetic shield in order to reduce the earth magnetic field ( typically a few tenths of gauss ) and any other spurious field to less than 0.1 gauss , will bring the systematic uncertainty to a negligible level .",
    "the specificity of the etika experiment can be used to measure the muon polarization in the @xmath126 decay .",
    "also in this case the transverse component of the muon polarization , proportional to @xmath127 , can reveal a possible violation of the t invariance .",
    "the transverse muon polarization in @xmath126 is negligible within the standard model , but the electromagnetic final state interaction can mimic t violation effects as large as @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "however , the contributions from final state interaction can in principle be precisely calculated , thus leaving the possibility of searching for t violation below the @xmath128 level .",
    "also , the knowledge of the expected value of the transverse polarization in the @xmath126 decay can be used to calibrate the polarization measurement .",
    "the expected sensitivity of the etika experiment for the @xmath126 decay mode is similar to that of the @xmath1 mode .",
    "apart from the specific capability of measuring the muon polarization , the detector is able to recontruct the kinematics of the kaon decay .",
    "for example , the dalitz plot density of @xmath1 given in equation ( 3 ) can be studied , which will provide an independent measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "precise measurements of the branching ratios and dalitz plot densities of the kaon decay modes will be performed , as well as a determination of the charged kaon lifetime .",
    "the potentiality of an experiment measuring the muon polarization in @xmath1 at a @xmath0 factory was discussed .",
    "particular attention was paid to the possibility of revealing unexpected violation of time reversal invariance through the transverse polarization component .",
    "an experimental method is proposed which is based on the reconstruction the @xmath1 decay products after stopping the charged kaons in a target placed around the beam pipe .",
    "the muon polarization is measured by observing the asymmetry in the angular distribution of positrons from the @xmath2 decay of muons stopped in in a polarization analyser .",
    "the experiment does not use a magnetic field , which limits the cost and dimensions of the detector .",
    "it was shown that an error @xmath3 on each muon polarization component can be obtained , which represents a factor ten improvement with respect to current limits on t invariance violation in the @xmath1 decay and a precise measurement of the @xmath4 parameter at the level of @xmath5 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are expected to be negligible .",
    "the detector is well suited to perform also other precise measurements , like the muon polarization in @xmath126 and the study of the charged kaon decay modes .",
    "the etika experiment could be a very interesting option for the long term physics program at a @xmath0 factory .",
