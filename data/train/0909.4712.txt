    "differently from the galaxy , the low - density environment of the magellanic clouds favors the gravitational interaction of single clusters , which form binary ( or multiple ) groupings and eventually will merge or disrupt .",
    "pieces of evidence on this subject are : ( i )  many binary clusters in the magellanic clouds have been identified and recognized as true physical systems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bhatia & hatzidimitriou 1988 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bhatia et al . 1991 ) ) ; ( ii )  deep and precise colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for isolated clusters in the large magellanic cloud revealed multi - population sequences ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mackey et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "if these facts are connected their results indicate that we are witnessing different stages of cluster evolution in a scenario where cluster groupings and mergers are not uncommon .",
    "evidence of cluster binarity and mergers has been reported for both clouds which are very rich in cluster pairs and multiplets ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we determine astrophysical and structural parameters of smc binary clusters by fitting isochrones to the cmds and king functions to the radial density profiles with the purpose of providing constraints on the evolution of such systems .",
    "the soar optical imager ( soi ) mounted in a bent - cassegrain configuration to the 4.1-m soar telescope ( cerro pachn , chile ) was employed to observe a sample of 7 merger candidates .",
    "images in bessel _ bv _ filters were obtained on photometric nights ( nov / oct 2007 ) , using the soi mini - mosaic of two e2v 2x4k ccds ( 1 pixel = 15@xmath1 m ) to cover a 5.2x5.2(@xmath2)@xmath3 field of view .",
    "the ccds were binned to 2x2 pixels yielding a scale of 0.154/pixel .",
    "the average seeing was @xmath40.95   in _ b _ and @xmath40.8   in _ v_. two images in each filter were obtained , with single exposure times of 480s in _ b _ and 195s in _",

    "we built the radial density profile ( rdp ) for each merger candidate component by employing star counts in circular rings around the cluster center . for the sake of uniformity , all rdps",
    "are based on rings 5  wide . in order to get an optimized rdp , we limit the data to a threshold magnitude for which the difference between the cluster central density and the adjacent field density is maximum .",
    "the cluster center is tweaked in the process .",
    "all stars fainter than this threshold are then disregarded in the analysis .",
    "we employed two - parameter ( central density @xmath5 , core radius @xmath6 ) king profiles ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the background was determined by fitting a constant to the outermost 4 rings , which was then subtracted from the overall stellar density before the king profile fitting was performed .",

    "we have obtained astrophysical parameters by fitting padova isochrones ( ( * ? ? ? * girardi et al . 2002 ) ) to the _ v _ @xmath7 ( _ b  v _ ) cmds . in order to minimize the contamination of background stellar fields , a circular region defined by a limiting radius ( @xmath8 ) covering the cluster central area was selected .",
    "@xmath8 is defined as the radius where the cluster stellar density begins to stand out from the background one .",

    "in general , our age estimates agree with cmd based age determinations in the literature ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the ages of l51/b78 and ngc422/ic1641 have been determined using isochrone fittings for the first time .",
    "because of a disturbed surface brightness profile and isophotal features , ( * ? ? ? * carvalho  ( 2008 ) ) classified k50 and ngc376 as mergers and the pairs ic1612e / w and ngc241/242 as true binary clusters .",
    "except for ngc422/ic1641 and ic1612e / w , all cluster pairings in our sample are nearly coeval and have ages close to @xmath10yr , consistent with the time scales of dynamical models . ngc422/ic1641 and ic1612e / w have ages that differ by 390myr and 60myr respectively , implying that , if they are interacting , a capture process may have occurred .",
    "another possibility is that the oldest cluster in the pair triggered the star formation that originated the youngest one via supernovae explosions and shell expansion .",
    "such mechanism has also been proposed as a plausible explanation by ( * ? ? ? * vallenari  ( 1998 ) ) for the lmc pair ngc1903/sl357 , although their age difference is 550myr .    concerning the time scales involved",
    ", the expected effect of the gravitational interaction for clusters having a mass of @xmath11m@xmath12 and half mass radius of 10pc , is that they will merge in @xmath10yr if their separation is @xmath425pc ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sugimoto & makino 1989 ) ) .",
    "models for less massive clusters in the lmc tidal field give a few @xmath10yr for the pair lifetime , with separations varying from @xmath46pc for cluster masses @xmath13m@xmath12 and @xmath414pc for @xmath14m@xmath12 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bhatia 1990 ) ) . according to these models , after this time scale either the cluster pair merges due to mutual gravitational interaction or disrupts by the galactic tidal field and , in a less probable event , by passing giant molecular clouds",
    ".    clusters resulting from pairs that have merged are expected to show structural properties which differ from those of single clusters .",
    "the plot of @xmath8 against age indicates that k50 , ngc376 and ic1611 have a larger @xmath8 than the mean locus of single clusters , which may be an additional evidence for their merger status ( ( * ? ? ?",
