    "the understanding of the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fascinating and challenging tasks .",
    "general features of hot and dense matter are summarized in the qcd phase diagram which can be probed by ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments such as the rhic ( bnl ) , lhc ( cern ) and the planned future cbm experiment at the fair facility in darmstadt .",
    "theoretical considerations indicate that at high temperature and high baryon densities there should be a phase transition from ordinary hadronic matter to a chirally symmetric plasma of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "several issues concerning this transition are not yet clarified @xcite .",
    "qcd in this temperature and density regime is a strongly coupled theory and hence perturbation theory can not be used . in the absence of a systematically improvable and converging method to approach qcd at finite density one often turns to model investigations",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these models incorporate the important chiral symmetry breaking mechanism of qcd but neglect any effects of confinement . only recently",
    ", certain aspects of confinement based on the polyakov loop have been incorporated in chiral effective models in a systematic fashion @xcite and interesting conclusions could be drawn ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the most prominent finding from low - energy chiral effective models is the qcd critical end point ( cep ) @xcite .",
    "common to almost all effective model calculations is that the chiral phase transition is continuous in the low density region and discontinuous in the high density regime .",
    "consequently , the endpoint where the phase transition ceases to be discontinuous is the qcd critical end point .",
    "unfortunately , several obvious and related features such as the exact location of this point in the qcd phase diagram can not be predicted by these models .    on the other side ,",
    "lattice qcd simulations are important alternatives to effective models calculations and can gain much insights in the qcd phase structure @xcite . due to the notorious sign problem emerging at finite baryon density reliable predictions for qcd are still not conclusive .",
    "even worse , recently different lattice methods that circumvent the sign problem are in conflict to each other . for example , using the imaginary chemical potential method for three physical quark masses no critical endpoint in the phase diagram is found @xcite .",

    "the restoration of the chiral @xmath7 and axial @xmath5 symmetries with temperature and quark chemical potentials are investigated .",
    "the axial @xmath5 anomaly is considered via an effective t  hooft determinant in the lagrangian which breaks the @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the restoration of the @xmath5 symmetry is linked to a vanishing of the topological susceptibility which can further be related to the @xmath2 mass via the witten - veneziano relation @xcite .",
    "some results depend sensitively on the model parameters which are tuned to reproduce the vacuum phenomenology .",
    "there are model - input parameters such as the @xmath6 meson mass which are poorly known experimentally .",

    "besides the explicit symmetry breaking terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 the model has five more parameters : the squared tree - level mass of the meson fields @xmath53 , two possible quartic coupling constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 , a yukawa coupling @xmath14 and a cubic coupling constant @xmath56 which models the axial @xmath5 anomaly of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry of the classical qcd lagrangian is anomalous @xcite , i.e.  broken by quantum effects . without the anomaly a ninth pseudoscalar goldstone boson corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral @xmath57 symmetry should emerge .",

    "in this section , the derivation of the grand thermodynamic potential for the three - flavor model is given .",
    "we will use a mean - field approximation similar to the one for the two - flavor model in @xcite .",
    "the mean - field approximation is simple in its application , in particular at finite temperature and quark densities .",
    "low - energy theorems , such as e.g. the goldstone theorem or the ward identities are also fulfilled at finite temperatures and densities . in this way we can circumvent more",
    "advanced many - body resummation techniques which are usually necessary to cure the breakdown of naive perturbation theory due to infrared divergences .",
    "for example , it is well - known that the standard loop expansion or related expansion methods of the @xmath35 version of the l@xmath6mwith or without quarks break down at finite temperature and imaginary meson masses are generated in the spontaneously broken phase @xcite .",
    "contributions of thermal excitations to the meson masses are neglected in these approximation schemes which result in a too rapid decrease of the meson masses and the e.g.  squared pion mass becomes negative for temperatures much below the phase transition .",
    "this deficiency can be cured by self - consistent resummation schemes such as e.g.  the hartree approximation in the cjt formalism @xcite or the so - called optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) e.g.  @xcite and variants thereof .",
    "recently , the opt method has been frequently applied to the three flavor l@xmath6mwith and without quarks at finite temperature and baryon densities @xcite . however , the predictive power of the opt method depends on how it is implemented and approximations thereof are made .",
    "for instance , when the external momentum of the self - energy are taken on - shell a solution of the corresponding gap equation and also of the equation of state cease to exist above a certain temperature , particularly below the critical one .",
    "details and some improvements of certain approximations in the opt framework can be found in @xcite .",
    "all these problems do not emerge in the mean - field approximation used here .",
    "this enables us to study the phase structure of the more involved three flavor model in great detail and in a rather simple framework .    in order to calculate the grand potential in mean - field approximation we start from the partition function . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the grand partition function is defined by a path integral over the quark / antiquark and meson fields @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the temperature and @xmath75 the three - dimensional volume of the system . for three quark flavors",

    "we denote the degenerated light quark quantities by an index @xmath81 , i.e.  the light quark chemical potential by @xmath82 , and the strange quark quantities by an index @xmath50 .",
    "the calculation of the partition function in the mean - field approximation is performed similar to refs .",
    "@xcite for the two - flavor case .",
    "the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the mesons are neglected and the quarks / antiquarks are retained as quantum fields .",
    "this means that the integration over the mesonic fields in is dropped and the fields are replaced by their non - vanishing vacuum expectation values @xmath83 .",
    "the remaining integration over the grassmann fields yields a determinant which can be rewritten as a trace over a logarithm .",
    "evaluating the trace within the matsubara formalism , the quark contribution @xmath84 of the grand potential is obtained @xcite . the ultraviolet divergent vacuum contribution to @xmath84",
    "which results from the negative energy states of the dirac sea has been neglected here ( cf .  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "finally , the total grand potential is obtained as a sum of the quark contribution and meson contribution @xmath85 as    @xmath86    explicitly , the quark contribution reads @xmath87 with the usual fermionic occupation numbers for the quarks @xmath88 and antiquarks @xmath89 respectively . the number of internal quark degrees of freedom is denoted by @xmath90 .",
    "the flavor - dependent single - particle energies are @xmath91 with the flavor - dependent quark masses @xmath92 which are also functions of the expectation values @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "the vacuum condensates @xmath43 and @xmath45 are members of the scalar ( @xmath93 ) nonet and both contain strange and non - strange components . for the further analysis it is more convenient to convert the condensates into a pure non - strange and strange part .",
    "this is achieved by an orthogonal basis transformation from the original octet - singlet basis ( @xmath94 ) to the non - strange ( @xmath95 ) and strange ( @xmath96 ) quark flavor basis @xmath97    as a consequence , the light quark sector decouples from the strange quark sector ( cf .",

    "the order parameters for the chiral phase transition are identified here with the expectation value @xmath100 for the non - strange and with @xmath101 for the strange sector .",
    "they are obtained by minimizing the total thermodynamic potential ( [ eq : grand_pot ] ) in the non - strange and strange directions @xmath102 the solutions of these coupled equations determine the behavior of the chiral order parameters as a function of @xmath74 and chemical potentials , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "note , that the in - medium condensates are also labeled with a bar over the corresponding fields .",
    "the l@xmath6mwith three quark flavors has altogether seven parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath14 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and two unknown condensates @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "the various transition lines in the phase diagram shrink towards the origin of the phase diagram for smaller pion and kaon masses because the condensates decrease more rapidly as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials . if one rescales the temperature with the critical temperature at @xmath146 and the chemical potential with the critical chemical potential at @xmath133 then all the transition lines in the phase diagram lie on top of each other for different pion masses .    in connection with the existence of the cep in the phase diagram",
    "it is interesting to analyze its mass sensitivity . for this purpose",
    "the critical surface for the chiral phase transition is evaluated in as a function of the pion and the kaon masses with ( left panel ) and without ( right panel ) the @xmath5 symmetry breaking .",
    "again the masses are tuned by variation of only the explicit symmetry breaking parameters ( see ) while keeping all other model parameters fixed similar to ref .",

    "the explicit symmetry breaking parameter for the strange direction @xmath106 in can become negative .",
    "the corresponding kaon mass , where this happens , is given by @xmath256 and is shown in both panels as a solid line .",
    "the critical surface is defined by the value of the critical chemical potential @xmath141 of the cep for a given mass pair @xmath257 .",
    "it is the surface of the second - order phase transition points displayed in a three - dimensional @xmath258-space .",
    "for values of the chemical potential above the chiral phase transition is of first - order while for values below the surface the transition lies in the crossover region . with or without anomaly the critical surface grows out perpendicular from the @xmath257-mass plane at @xmath259 .",
    "the tangent plane to the critical surface has a decreasing slope for larger masses as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag_mub ] or fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag_mub_mpik ] .",
    "thus , this model study excludes the so - called nonstandard scenario , found in a recent lattice analysis with imaginary chemical potentials , where the first - order region shrinks as the chemical potential is turned on @xcite . in the nonstandard scenario",
    "the bending of the critical surface has the opposite sign and the physical realistic mass point remains in the crossover region for any @xmath131 . in the figure the physical mass point is denoted by an arrow .",
    "since the critical chemical potential @xmath141 can not grow arbitrarily the surface must have a boundary and hence stops to exist for larger @xmath257-masses which are not shown in the figure .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the l@xmath6mwith quarks in an one - loop approximation , based on optimized perturbation theory , was evaluated and an bending of the critical surface away from the @xmath260-axis at @xmath261 for a kaon masses greater than @xmath262 mev was observed .",
    "the precise value of @xmath260 for the onset of the bending depends on the order of the used chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath263pt ) for the baryon mass extrapolations .",
    "thus , the unphysical bending indicates that the validity range of the @xmath263pt for the baryons , used for the model parameter extrapolation away from the physical point , was exceeded . as a consequence ,",
    "no ( tri)critical point on the @xmath260-axis for @xmath146 where the boundary of the first - order transition region terminates , can be located .    in this work",
    "no strong bending of the surface away from the @xmath260-axis is seen for kaon masses not larger than @xmath232 mev but it also seems that it never approaches the @xmath260-axis at least for @xmath170 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "including the anomaly we find a critical @xmath264 mev where the critical surface intersects the solid line in the left panel of . on this line and for @xmath265",
    "the transition turns into a smooth crossover . on the contrary , without anomaly",
    "( right panel in the figure ) , no critical pion mass is found at @xmath146 at least for values below @xmath266 mev .",
    "this means that the phase transition on the solid line is still of first - order similar to the findings of @xcite where the influence of the anomaly on the phase transition for vanishing chemical potentials within a @xmath7 l@xmath6mwithout fermions in hartree approximation has been investigated .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the @xmath5 anomaly on the shape of the surface is rather marginal for a kaon mass greater than @xmath262 mev ( cf .  both panels in ) .",
    "for larger kaon masses the strange sector decouples from the light sector and the chiral phase transition is basically driven by the ( light ) nonstrange particles .",
    "on the other hand , for a kaon masses smaller than @xmath262 mev we see a considerable influence of the anomaly on the shape of the critical surface . without anomaly the region of first - order phase transitions at @xmath146",
    "is reduced which is in contrast to the results obtained with a l@xmath6mwithout quarks @xcite . in this reference , it is found that the first - order transition region at @xmath146 grows with and without anomaly for increasing sigma masses . for sigma masses greater than @xmath232 mev and without anomaly the physical point",
    "is well located within the first - order region while it is always in the crossover region with anomaly .    including quarks we obtain an opposite tendency : the physical point is always in the crossover region and for larger sigma masses the size of the first - order transition region at @xmath146 decreases as can be seen from . in this figure",
    "five crosssections , for @xmath267 mev of the chiral critical surface with ( left ) and without anomaly ( right panel ) are shown as a function of the pion mass . as a trajectory in the @xmath268-plane",
    "a path through the physical point towards the chiral limit has been chosen for these figures .",
    "this path is given by fixing the pion over kaon mass ratio to the physical one , i.e. setting @xmath269 where the star denotes the corresponding physical masses .",
    "for larger @xmath8 values the chiral critical surface with anomaly moves to smaller pion masses .",
    "this effect is less pronounced if the anomaly is neglected ( right panel ) . in accordance with the chiral critical surface line for @xmath270 mev terminates before the physical point ( @xmath271 ) . due to the positive @xmath53 parameter we can not evaluate the chiral critical surface for arbitrary pion and kaon masses for smaller values of @xmath8 as already mentioned .",
    "nevertheless , the results for smaller sigma masses are shown as dashed light curves in both panels and stop at certain pion mass ratios .",
    "it is instructive to replace in the last the critical chemical potential with the critical temperature and investigate its mass sensitivity .",
    "this leads to where the critical temperatures of the cep s as a function of the pion mass similar to are plotted for five different @xmath6 meson masses with ( left panel ) and without anomaly ( right panel ) . in general , the curves start at zero temperature and grow to a certain finite value for decreasing pion masses . for the parameter sets without spontaneous symmetry breaking the curves with anomaly for @xmath272 and @xmath232 mev , and without anomaly for @xmath272 mev , show the opposite behavior . in this case ,",
    "i.e.  for smaller values of @xmath8 , and large unphysical pion masses @xmath273 , which is realized in lattice simulations , the location of the cep moves towards the @xmath74-axis . for decreasing pion masses",
    "the critical temperatures decrease meaning that the cep moves towards the @xmath131-axis in the chiral limit .",
    "consequently , for these parameter sets no first - order transition occurs in the chiral limit as already mentioned .",
    "nevertheless , all of curves intersect roughly at the physical point ( @xmath274 ) . only the extrapolation towards the chiral limit is questionable as can be seen by the positive slope of these curves for decreasing pion masses .",
    "in the present work chiral symmetry restoration in hot and dense hadronic matter is analyzed . as an effective realization of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum , the @xmath275 symmetric l@xmath6mwith quarks has been used . within this model ,",
    "the grand thermodynamic potential was evaluated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "six of the seven model parameters are fixed to the low - lying pseudoscalar mass spectrum , which is experimentally well - known and to the scalar sigma meson mass . since the experimental situation in the scalar sector is not very certain we have varied the value of the sigma mass over a wide range and have investigated its consequences for the physics .",
    "the remaining model parameter , the yukawa coupling , is determined by the non - strange constituent quark mass while the condensates are governed by the pcac relation .    at the physical mass point for various sigma masses a smooth finite temperature chiral crossover at zero density and a first - order transition for finite chemical potential at zero temperature",
    "the @xmath5 anomaly has only little influence on the strange condensate while no modification of the light condensate at the physical point is observed .",
    "the pseudocritical crossover temperature depends on the choice of the sigma meson mass and coincides with recent lattice simulations for mass values in between @xmath276 mev .    in our approximation",
    "no negative squared meson masses are generated in the medium as is the case for the l@xmath6mwithout quarks .",
    "low - energy theorems like the goldstone theorem or the ward identities are not only fulfilled in the vacuum but also in the medium .",
    "this enables a careful analysis of the chiral symmetry restoration pattern of the meson nonets with and without axial anomaly .",
    "an anticrossing of the scalar @xmath6-@xmath4 masses at higher temperature is seen which is reflected in the corresponding mixing angle investigation .",
    "for a sigma masses below @xmath277 mev a cep is found in the phase diagram .",
    "in contrast to a similar calculation in the njl model at this point the sigma meson mass drops below the pion mass .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the findings in the two flavor case .",
    "the chiral critical surface in the @xmath278-plane always has a positive slope such that the so - called non - standard scenario can be excluded . in the chiral",
    "limit the expected first - order transition at @xmath146 is found . a large modification caused by the anomaly",
    "is visible . with anomaly the first - order region in the @xmath146 plane",
    "is enlarged for smaller masses . for larger kaon masses",
    "the shape of the critical surface becomes independent of the anomaly .",
    "furthermore , for increasing @xmath8 the surface becomes steeper .",
    "one drawback of the effective model used here is the lack of confinement properties which certainly modify the thermodynamics in the broken phase .",
