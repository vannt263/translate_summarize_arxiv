    "young supernova remnants are in a period of transition to the sedov - taylor phase , sweeping up several times their original ejected mass as they expand into a circumstellar medium .",
    "the shocked gas at temperatures of 10@xmath1 k emits a thermal spectrum ( bremsstrahlung and lines ) through interactions of electrons with ions .",
    "however , the synchrotron emission , which produces the radio spectrum , persists through the x - ray regime ( and in some case dominates the thermal x - rays @xcite ) .    in order to study the energetics of the accelerated electrons and protons in the shock , as well as to obtain accurate abundances from thermal models ,",
    "it is imperative to understand this synchrotron spectrum .",
    "snr observations show that the synchrotron emission drops _ significantly _ below a powerlaw at x - ray frequencies , implying a curved synchrotron spectrum . to accurately describe the synchrotron spectrum we have developed the following models :    * * srcut * a homogeneous population of electrons , with an exponentially cut off power - law energy distribution , radiating in a constant magnetic field , produces the sharpest physically plausible cutoff in the emitted spectrum . given a radio flux and spectral index ,",
    "the models depend on a single parameter : the frequency at which the spectrum has dropped by a factor of 10 below the power - law extrapolation .",
    "if a remnant emits primarily thermal x - rays , _ srcut _ will give the maximum nonthermal - electron energies allowed , so as not to exceed observed x - ray fluxes .",
    "_ srcut _ fits to 14 galactic snrs give electron upper limits of 100 tev or less , well below the 1000 tev `` knee '' in the cosmic - ray ( ion ) spectrum.@xcite * * sresc * in some remnants the energy of the most energetic electrons will be limited because the shock can not effectively scatter particles above a certain gyroradius .",
    "the _ sresc _ model describes sedov expansion into a uniform magnetic field , appropriate for type ia and late core - collapse snr .",
    "details are discussed in reynolds ( 1998).@xcite    these models are currently available and will be distributed in the next release of xspec .",
    "the xspec model formats should also be compatible with cxc , the chandra software .",
    "more sophisticated models , as described in reynolds ( 1998)@xcite , will be released in the future .",
    "the electron scattering required for acceleration to high enough energies to produce synchrotron radiation may become less efficient above some energy . or , in the limiting case , electrons above some energy may freely escape the snr . in the escape model",
    "we assume that magnetohydrodynamic scattering waves are much weaker above some wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "since electrons with gyroradius @xmath3 scatter resonantly with waves of wavelengths @xmath4 , electrons will escape once their energy reaches @xmath5 given by :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the upstream magnetic field strength .",
    "reynolds ( 1998 ) produced a detailed model for snr emission with electron energies limited by escape , which includes correct accounting for variation of shock - acceleration efficiency and post - shock radiative and adiabatic losses , assuming sedov dynamics .",
    "the model has three parameters : 1 ) the radio flux measurement at 1 ghz , 2 ) @xmath8 , the radio spectral index ( flux density @xmath9 ) , 3 ) a characteristic rolloff frequency , the frequency at which the spectrum has dropped by approximately 10 below a straight powerlaw .",
    "the spectral index and 1 ghz flux for snr are fixed by observations . for galactic snrs",
    ", they can be found at green s website.@xcite",
    "sn 1006 ad is an example of a young remnant where the synchrotron emission dominates in the x - ray regime@xcite .",
    "early observations , with low signal to noise , could be adequately fit by curved synchrotron models @xcite .",
    "observations from rxte are a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity and provide a more sensitive test .",
    "asca and rxte observations of sn 1006 ad can be adequately fit with two components : the escape model and a thermal plane - parallel nonequilibrium - ionization shock model ( _ vshock _ ) with variable abundances ( borkowski et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the model fit depends relatively weakly on the flux at 1 ghz . for sn 1006 ad",
    "the flux was fixed at the observed value of 19 jy@xcite .",
    "the column density was fixed at @xmath10 @xmath11 , a value consistent with optical and rosat pspc observations .",
    "the best fit , shown in figure 1 , has a @xmath8=0.58 and the rolloff frequency of 1.7@xmath12 hz with a @xmath13 of 665 for 376 degrees of freedom .",
    "the _ vshock _ obtains abundances ( relative to solar ) of o 0.27 , ne 0.16 , mg 1.56 , si 6.43 and s 8.16 , compared in figure 2 to predictions for type ia supernova by nomoto et al.(1984).@xcite from the synchrotron formula , @xmath14 , and equation 1 , assuming a magnetic field of 3@xmath15 g , we calculate a @xmath2 of 1.2@xmath12 cm .",
    "x - ray emission from sn1006 ad is well fit by synchrotron models with electron energies limited by escape . comparing the escape model to future models that are limited by radiation losses or snr age will give us a better understanding of synchrotron emission at x - ray energies . our future work",
    "involves applying these models to snrs and making them widely available to the community by distribution through xspec .",

    "<S> galactic cosmic rays up to energies of around 10@xmath0  ev are assumed to originate in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . the shock wave of a young snr like sn 1006 ad can accelerate electrons to energies greater than 1 tev , where they can produce synchrotron radiation in the x - ray band . a new model ( _ sresc _ ) designed to model synchrotron x - rays from type ia supernovae can constrain values for the magnetic - field strength and electron scattering properties , with implications for the acceleration of the unseen ions which dominate the cosmic - ray energetics . </S>",
    "<S> new observations by asca , rosat , and rxte have provided enormously improved data , which now extend to higher x - ray energies . </S>",
    "<S> these data allow much firmer constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we will describe model fits to these new data on sn 1006 ad , emphasizing the physical constraints that can be placed on snrs and on the cosmic - ray acceleration process . </S>"
