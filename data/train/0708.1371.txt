    "strongly correlated electron systems show many interesting physical properties due to their complicated electronic structures .",
    "particularly , ce based compounds have been extensively studied by both experimental and theoretical approaches because they show variety of @xmath1 states due to different hybridization strength between the ce @xmath1 and valence electrons .",

    "therefore , complete study of the electronic states of ceru@xmath3 is essential for understanding physics of the strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "so far , ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 has eagerly been studied in order to elucidate the mechanism of the metamagnetic transition which occurs at @xmath13 7.7 t.@xcite according to the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) studies,@xcite the fermi surface ( fs ) of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 approaches to that of laru@xmath0si@xmath0 above @xmath14 due to the localization of the @xmath1 electrons .",
    "however , the dhva results of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 can not fully be explained by the band structure calculations under @xmath15.@xcite for example , the heaviest effective mass fs or the smallest fs signals have not been observed along the magnetic field direction of @xmath16 .",
    "recently , another experimental method named `` soft x - ray @xmath2-dependent angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) '' has been established to determine three - dimensional ( 3d ) fss by using energy tunable soft x rays from third - generation high brilliance synchrotron radiation light sources.@xcite in the arpes studies , we can observe electronic structures in solids at various temperatures and determine the shapes of fss which can be compared with the results from dhva measurements .",
    "dhva measurements can be performed under magnetic fields and high pressures but are confined to low temperatures . while dhva measurements probe genuine bulk electronic states , conventional photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements have been believed as a rather surface sensitive technique as far as the photoelectron kinetic energies are in the range of 20 - 200 ev .",
    "however , the bulk sensitivity of the soft x - ray ( @xmath17 800 ev ) pes was confirmed by the observation of the @xmath1 pes for ce compounds.@xcite soft x - ray pes is currently an essential approach to reveal electronic states of transition metal compounds@xcite and rare earth compounds.@xcite    in addition , more bulk - sensitive pes by using hard x rays ( haxpes ) has become feasible.@xcite the probing depth of pes depends on the kinetic energy of the photoelectron . according to tpp-2 m formula,@xcite a photoelectron inelastic",
    "mean free path @xmath18 can be estimated as a function of the electron kinetic energy ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath20 19   at @xmath19 = 800 ev and @xmath20 115   at @xmath19 = 7000 ev for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "haxpes is also useful in order to obtain bulk - sensitive core - level spectra with negligible surface contribution .",
    "for example , the surface spectral weight of the ce @xmath5 level located at the binding energy ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath8 900 ev can be significantly reduced by haxpes .    by virtue of the soft x - ray arpes experiments ,",
    "we have so far clarified 3d fss of ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the results of the arpes measurements were compared with the lda calculation for laru@xmath0ge@xmath0 performed on the ce @xmath1 electron localized model.@xcite the difference between the arpes results and the calculation for laru@xmath0ge@xmath0 or dhva results for ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 in the ferromagnetic phase@xcite can be explained by non - negligible small hybridization between its ce @xmath1 and valence electrons.@xcite we have extended the study to @xmath2-dependent soft x - ray arpes , haxpes and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) for ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 and a heavy fermion system ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 in order to reveal their electronic structures .",

    "apart from the band 4 , most of the band structures of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 revealed by the soft x - ray arpes results resemble those obtained by the lda calculation for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0@xcite which treats @xmath1 electrons as itinerant . the band calculation for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0@xcite",

    "the approach of the four bands 2 to 5 toward the x point is remarkably similar to the calculation which predicts the approach of the bands 3 to 5 at the x point .",
    "however , it was experimentally found that the band 1 does not cross @xmath27 as shown in fig .",

    "the peak position of the band 1 at the z point for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 is located at higher - binding energies than that of ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 .",
    "the band 1 s peak position of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 at the z point is 0.27 ev , whereas that of ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 is about 0.14 ev .",
    "additionally , figs .",
    "[ detail ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the difference between the bottom positions of the band 4 and the band 3 in ceru@xmath3 .",
    "the position of each band of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 lies in higher binding energies than those of ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 near the x point .",
    "the prominent difference of the band structures between ceru@xmath3 appears for the band 5 as shown in figs .",
    "[ detail ] ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "this difference of the band 5 obtained from arpes is in good agreement with the difference of the band calculations between laru@xmath0ge@xmath0 and ceru@xmath0si@xmath0.@xcite the band 5 of laru@xmath0ge@xmath0 crosses @xmath27 three times in the region along the @xmath44-x direction , while that of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 crosses only once in the same region .",
    "when we take a different perspective , it is possible to think that @xmath27 of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 is shifted to lower binding energies or to the unoccupied side compared to ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 along the @xmath44-x direction .",
    "these differences of the band position in ceru@xmath3 is roughly understood if @xmath27 of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 is energetically higher than that of ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the @xmath27 shift of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 from ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 in the paramagnetic phase is caused by the increased number of electrons contributing to the bands forming the fss in ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 due to the hybridization with the @xmath1 electrons . as confirmed by the siam calculation of the @xmath5 pes and xas spectra , and by the @xmath65 resonance pes ,",
    "the hybridization is stronger for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 than for ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 indicating the @xmath27 shift mentioned above .    for more precise understanding of the difference in the electronic structures between ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 and ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 ,",
    "this  rigid - band - like \" energy shift is not sufficient because the band structures themselves can be modified due to the different hybridization strength at different @xmath87 values .",
    "indeed , such a modification can be seen in figs .",
    "[ detail ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , ( d ) .",
    "for instance , the bands 3 to 5 are nearly degenerated at the x point in ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 , whereas these are energetically separated in ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 . the band 5-dispersion along the @xmath44-x direction shown in figs .",
    "[ detail ] ( e ) and ( f ) , especially near the @xmath44 point , is also essentially modified because the simple @xmath27 shift would lead to the shift of @xmath45 due to the band 5 indicated by the bold dotted line in figs .",
    "[ detail](e ) and [ detail](f ) toward the @xmath44 point for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 , which is inconsistent with the experimental results . in this way ,",
    "the essential differences in the band structures between ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 and ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 are experimentally clarified .",
    "we have performed bulk - sensitive 3d arpes ce @xmath5 core - level haxpes and xas for a heavy fermion system ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 and a @xmath1-localized system ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 by using soft and hard x rays .",
    "the detailed band structures and the shapes of the fss of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 are revealed and they are found to be different from those of ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0 .",
    "the differences between them are consistent with the differences between the calculation for @xmath1 electron itinerant model and localized one .",
    "the fs shapes of ceru@xmath3 are consistently understood as the reflection of the hybridization strength between the ce @xmath1 and valence electrons , which is revealed by the analysis based on siam for the ce @xmath5 haxpes and @xmath65 xas spectra .",
