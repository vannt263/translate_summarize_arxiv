    "observations of many star - forming galaxies show that a common mode of star formation involves the production of young massive star clusters ( or  super star clusters \" ) , which might have masses @xmath1few@xmath2 with half - mass radii of @xmath1few  pc ( e.g. , van den bergh 1971 and numerous subsequent papers ; see maz - appellniz 2001 for a review of the structural parameters of such clusters ) .",
    "according to recent n - body simulations ( ebisuzaki et al . 2001 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) , monte carlo simulations ( grkan , freitag , & rasio 2004 ) , and semi - analytic treatments ( mouri & taniguchi 2002b ) , when such a cluster is compact enough it can evolve dynamically in such as way as to produce runaway collisions in its center in the few million years before the most massive stars explode .",
    "such collisions could produce a black hole of several hundred solar masses , and subsequent dynamical processes could add additional mass to the black hole ( miller & hamilton 2002a , b ; mouri & taniguchi 2002a ; gltekin , miller , & hamilton 2004 ) . as suggested by ebisuzaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , clusters of this type that start close enough to the center of their host galaxy will sink to the center within a few billion years , where they will eventually release their black hole .",
    "rough estimates ( see   3 ) suggest that a few times per year , a merger of such an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) with the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) will be detected by space - based gravitational wave detectors such as the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) .    if these mergers occur , they will be ideal sources with which to probe the spacetime geometry around rotating black holes ( see the discussion in cutler & thorne 2002 ) .",
    "the mass ratio ( typically @xmath3 ) is large enough that the imbh acts almost as a test particle , but the signal strength is much larger than it is for mergers of stellar - mass black holes with smbh ( hughes 2001 ; cutler & thorne 2002 ; glampedakis , hughes , & kennefick 2002 ) . as a result , although there is much greater uncertainty about the event rate for imbh - smbh mergers than for mergers of stellar - mass and supermassive black holes ( thus design considerations for _ lisa _ should focus on the latter ) , if even a single imbh - smbh merger is detected , then high - precision constraints on gravitational radiation and the kerr spacetime will be possible with greatly simplified data analysis .    here",
    "we discuss the dynamics and implications of such imbh - smbh mergers . in ",
    "2 we describe the astrophysical scenario of an influx of imbhs into the center of a galaxy . in ",
    "3 we make estimates of the strength of the signal , and discuss data analysis in the _ lisa _ context .",
    "we summarize in   4 .",
    "throughout this paper , we consider interactions of a supermassive black hole of mass @xmath4 with one or more intermediate - mass black holes of mass @xmath5 .",
    "we scale these masses by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "if a super star cluster of mass @xmath8 is embedded in a much lower density stellar environment , it will act dynamically as a single object . adapting equation ( 7 - 26 ) of binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) and equation ( 2 ) of ebisuzaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the dynamical friction time for such a cluster to sink from a distance @xmath9 to the center of a galaxy with three - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "therefore , a cluster will be able to sink to the center within much less than a hubble time if it starts anywhere within the inner few hundred parsecs of its host galaxy .    from this point",
    ", we expect the following sequence : ( 1 )  the cluster sinks until it is stripped or tidally disrupted , thus releasing its imbh , ( 2 )  the imbh sinks rapidly until the stellar mass interior to it is less than the mass of the imbh , ( 3 )  the orbital radius of the imbh around the smbh shrinks via interactions with stars , as long as the relaxation time for the surrounding stars is less than a hubble time , and ( 4 )  the imbh either merges with the smbh due to interactions with stars followed by inspiral caused by gravitational radiation , or one or more additional imbhs settle to the center and interact dynamically , causing mergers .",
    "we now discuss each of these steps .",
    "_ cluster mass loss._as the cluster sinks , it can lose stars in several ways ( a similar discussion in the context of stars at the galactic center is in hansen & milosavljevic 2003 ) .",
    "the first is tidal stripping .",
    "that is , if the cluster mass and radius are @xmath8 and @xmath13 , respectively , then the outer portions of the cluster will be stripped away when the cluster is a distance @xmath14 from the center of the galaxy , where the tidal radius @xmath15 is given by @xmath16^{1/3}r_{\\rm cl}\\ ; .\\ ] ] observations of the central regions of many galaxies suggest that the velocity dispersion is relatively constant ( k. gebhardt , personal communication ) .",
    "this is therefore consistent with an isothermal density profile , in which @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion ( see equation 4 - 123 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "rewriting , we find that the tidal radius is @xmath19^{1/2}r_{\\rm cl}\\ ; , \\ ] ] or about @xmath20 for @xmath21 and a half - mass radius @xmath22  pc .",
    "this will typically allow the cluster to sink in to @xmath23  pc , which it does within @xmath24  yr if it started at @xmath25  pc .",
    "if we assume that the cluster itself has mass distributed roughly as an isothermal sphere , then @xmath26 and therefore the relaxation time scales as @xmath27 because the tidal radius scales as @xmath13 .",
    "however , the cluster itself will also evolve dynamically . from the pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) catalog of galactic globular clusters ,",
    "the typical half - mass relaxation time for a globular is @xmath28  yr . for a cluster with @xmath29 stars and a crossing time of @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion of the cluster ) , the cluster relaxation time is @xmath32 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for an isothermal sphere , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 .",
    "once tidal stripping of the cluster begins , therefore , the cluster relaxation time will decrease faster than the dynamical friction time .",
    "when @xmath36 , the cluster will disperse and the imbh will be on its own . for typical masses and radii of clusters , the above simplified treatment would suggest that this will happen when @xmath37  pc . given that clusters that form imbhs tend to have short relaxation times",
    ", there could be a concern that these clusters would disrupt earlier .",
    "however , simulations by kim , figer , & morris ( 2004 ) and by a. grkan & f. rasio ( in preparation ) support the suggestion of hansen & milosavljevic ( 2003 ) that the presence of an imbh in the center of a cluster increases the velocity dispersion of the stars and hence their relaxation time . therefore",
    ", it is found numerically that in fact the imbh is released at @xmath1few  pc .",
    "thus equation ( 1 ) suggests that the imbh will take @xmath38 to sink to the center .",
    "clusters that start within @xmath25  pc of the center will be able to deliver their central intermediate - mass black holes to the center within a few hundred million years .    for completeness",
    ", we now discuss another way in which a cluster could theoretically be dispersed .",
    "given that the velocity dispersion of stars in a galactic bulge is much greater than the velocity dispersion of stars in a cluster , passage of bulge stars through the cluster will soften the cluster somewhat , and will eventually cause it to evaporate .",
    "one can show , however , that this effect is unimportant . from binney & tremaine ( 1987 , equation 4 - 6a ) ,",
    "the typical change in squared transverse velocity of a particle of mass @xmath39 going at speed @xmath40 through a cluster of @xmath29 particles of mass @xmath39 within a radius @xmath41 is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a coulomb logarithm .",
    "if we use @xmath44 and assume a cluster velocity dispersion of @xmath45 , then this becomes @xmath46 because these are softening interactions , we will assume that the energy of the cluster is always _ increased _ by @xmath47 .",
    "as these are fast interactions , there is little gravitational focusing and hence the mass per time interacting with the cluster is simply @xmath48 . for an isothermal sphere , @xmath49 at distance @xmath9 from the center .",
    "the change in energy per time is then @xmath50 the total binding energy of a singular isothermal sphere is @xmath51 therefore , the softening time is @xmath52 the coulomb logarithms for @xmath53 and for @xmath54 will be different in general , but probably not by more than a factor of a few ( @xmath12 for softening is likely to be of order 10 - 15 , but for dynamical friction is probably 3 - 5 ; see spinnato et al .",
    "therefore , as an approximation we can effectively cancel the coulomb logarithms when we take the ratio : @xmath55 for example , if @xmath56 , @xmath57  km  s@xmath58 , and @xmath59  km  s@xmath58 , then @xmath60 .",
    "softening by interactions with bulge stars can always be neglected in comparison with other effects .",
    "_ initial inspiral of the imbh._after the cluster disrupts , the imbh itself will spiral in independently . as a first stage , it will spiral in to where the mass interior to it is not much less than the mass of the imbh itself . for a stellar number density of @xmath61  pc@xmath62",
    ", this implies a distance of @xmath63  pc , but for a higher density it will be less .",
    "for example , hansen & milosavljevic quote the genzel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) density profile of the central cusp of the galaxy as implying @xmath64 , where 1\"=0.04  pc at 8  kpc .",
    "this implies a higher density , so that the rapid inspiral of a @xmath7 imbh will occur down to a separation of @xmath65  pc . from above , the inspiral of the imbh will start from a few parsecs , hence it will come in on a timescale of @xmath66  yr for typical densities and velocity dispersions .    _",
    "long - term inspiral of the imbh._further settling of the imbh requires that it interact with a significant mass in stars .",
    "if the stars have fully isotropized orbits , this is easy : for a strongly gravitationally focused encounter with a binary of total mass @xmath4 and semimajor axis @xmath67 the cross section is @xmath68 and the timescale of interaction is @xmath69 , which is much less than a year for typical masses , velocities , and densities .",
    "however , stars that interact with the imbh - smbh binary are eventually thrown out of the system , so the bottleneck is the time needed for other stars to diffuse into the required orbital phase space .",
    "this  loss cone \" of stars could cause supermassive black hole binaries to stall in their inspiral , before they get close enough for gravitational radiation to be significant ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ; see sigurdsson & rees 1997 , milosavljevic & merritt 2003 , sigurdsson 2003 , and makino & funato 2004 for recent discussions ) . for imbhs ,",
    "this is not likely to be a problem . as discussed by yu & tremaine ( 2003 ) , once the original contingent of stars",
    "is ejected from the loss cone , the system will settle into a state in which the rate of diffusion of stars into the loss cone is balanced by the rate at which they are ejected by interaction with the imbh - smbh binary . from equation ( 38 ) of yu &",
    "tremaine ( 2003 ) , the hardening timescale for a black hole binary of total mass @xmath4 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the typical stellar mass in the central regions and @xmath72 is a characteristic value for the diffusion rate @xmath73 into the loss cone .",
    "therefore , depending on the details of the stellar distribution , the orbital radius of the imbh could be reduced by several e - foldings in a hubble time , especially if the smbh has @xmath74 .",
    "this process could be enhanced slightly because stars that interact with the imbh will typically not be ejected entirely from the core , hence they will return for several interactions ( milosavljevic & merritt 2003 ) . in addition , gas dynamical friction from molecular clouds ( see , e.g. , ostriker 1999 ) can shrink the orbit further .",
    "_ final merger with the smbh._by the time @xmath75  pc , gravitational radiation can be important for an imbh - smbh binary .",
    "the timescale to merger is @xmath76 ( from , e.g. , peters 1964 ) where @xmath77 is the orbital eccentricity .",
    "thus , if @xmath78  pc or the eccentricity is high , merger can happen within a hubble time .",
    "therefore , in contrast what might be the case for two supermassive black holes in a binary ( begelman et al . 1980 ) , it is unlikely that there is a hang - up problem for an imbh - smbh binary .",
    "the difference is that an imbh - smbh binary at a given separation has a much smaller binding energy than a binary with two supermassive black holes .",
    "hence , the stars that are ejected or displaced in the process of hardening the binary come from a relatively smaller volume , in which the relaxation time is short enough to repopulate the loss cone .",
    "given that each imbh by assumption brings with it several hundred thousand new stars , there will always be a fresh set of stars to supply dynamical friction .",
    "it is therefore possible that tens or even hundreds of imbhs could be brought in sequentially , each merging with the smbh before the next imbh arrives .",
    "note that this situation is dramatically different from the processes for mergers of stellar - mass black holes with supermassive black holes . in that case , the dynamical friction time for stellar - mass black holes is much too long to get to the center in a hubble time . as a result",
    ", only rare scatters of stellar - mass black holes into extremely high eccentricity orbits , followed by capture onto the smbh by release of energy in gravitational radiation , can lead to a merger ( e.g. , freitag 2003 ; sigurdsson 2003 ) .",
    "in contrast , the scenario we describe for imbhs leads to sinking of the imbh towards the center on a relatively short timescale .",
    "gravitational radiation capture of black holes on hyperbolic orbits is not necessary .",
    "if the timescale for dynamical friction and merger is longer than the timescale for the next imbh to sink in ( e.g. , because the stellar number density at the center is much less than we have assumed ) , then a few imbhs will interact with each other as they orbit the smbh .",
    "this will lead to instabilities in the orbits .",
    "the exact criterion for instability depends on mass ratios and eccentricities ( e.g. , see mardling & aarseth 2001 for a comparable - mass binary orbited by a tertiary of arbitrary mass ) , but if orbits of particles approach each other within a few tens of percent of their orbital radii then instability usually results .",
    "once this occurs , the orbiting imbhs will interact with each other until either ( 1 )  secular resonances drive the inner imbh close enough to the smbh that the pair merges because of gravitational radiation ( a situation that preliminary simulations suggest may be surprisingly common ) , or ( 2 )  one or several imbhs are ejected , implying by energy conservation that the inner one or several imbhs are driven closer to the smbh . in the latter case , simulations must be performed to determine the efficiency of this process , that is , the average number of imbhs ejected for each one that merges . if simulations of stellar - mass black holes around an imbh are a guide , then ejections may be dominant ( see , e.g. , baumgardt , makino , & ebisuzaki 2004 ) .",
    "however , the dynamics of smbh - imbh systems could be different in several important ways .",
    "for example , if an imbh is ejected from the core but not the entire bulge , its periapse is still of order the imbh - smbh binary semimajor axis , so barring significant deflection during its orbit it could interact again on the next pass . in addition , although the imbh - smbh mass ratio is small enough to prevent ejection of the binary , if the inner region has been evacuated of stars because of prior interactions then the small binary kick due to imbh ejection will cause the binary to move significantly , to where it can interact with more stars and harden further .",
    "numerical details of the interactions also need to be computed to estimate quantities such as the eccentricity in the sensitivity band of a particular gravitational radiation detector , and to determine whether two imbhs might pass close enough to each other to form bound pairs by the loss of energy to gravitational radiation , leading to imbh - imbh mergers ( d. hamilton , personal communication ) .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "however , the main point is that the imbhs are expected to merge with the central smbh eventually , rather than stalling or being ejected . as we now discuss , this is a high mass ratio merger ( and hence comparatively easy to calculate ) with a large enough signal to noise ratio that it will be possible to detect it near the end of inspiral in just a few cycles , requiring very few templates .",
    "the information content of the signal from an imbh - smbh binary depends on the signal to noise ratio . to compute the signal strength , we assume for simplicity that the binary is nearly circular by the time it enters the sensitivity band of an instrument such as _ lisa _ ; we will discuss the possibility of an eccentric binary in ",
    "the rest - frame frequency of gravitational radiation from a nearly circular binary a time @xmath79 from merger is ( see peters & mathews 1963 ; peters 1964 for the basic equations ) @xmath80 at which point the orbital semimajor axis in units of the gravitational radius @xmath81 is @xmath82 if the source is at a redshift @xmath83 then the observed frequency is @xmath84 . from , e.g. , schutz ( 1997 ) , the dimensionless amplitude of a circular binary at a line of sight comoving distance @xmath85",
    ", averaged over all observer angles , is @xmath86 at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a nonrotating smbh , @xmath87 , the amplitude and rest - frame frequency are @xmath88 note that the amplitude at the isco is independent of @xmath4 , because @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the effective _ lisa _ noise includes contributions from the instrument and from unresolved binaries ( e.g. , see larson , hiscock , & hellings 2000 and http://www.srl.caltech.edu/@xmath1shane/sensitivity/makecurve.html ) . from @xmath91",
    "hz , unresolved galactic double white dwarf binaries exceed the instrumental noise ( e.g. , farmer & phinney 2003 ) ; from @xmath92  hz , in contrast , there will typically be one or zero double white dwarf binaries in a @xmath93  hz bin , hence after several years of operation , it will be possible to model individual binaries and subtract them from the data stream .",
    "unresolved extragalactic double white dwarf binaries will , however , continue to make a contribution .",
    "the minimum total noise is in the few mhz range , where the total one - sided spectral noise density at a signal to noise @xmath94 is @xmath95    the time necessary to detect an smbh - imbh binary at s / n=10 is @xmath96 ^ 2 $ ] . if @xmath97 , then @xmath98 multiplying @xmath99 by @xmath100 gives the number of cycles in the time @xmath100 : @xmath101 the minimum observational time and number of cycles are obtained when the source is near the isco , which occurs in the most favorable frequency band @xmath97 when the redshifted mass @xmath102 is between @xmath103 and @xmath104 . at this point , @xmath105 more generally , as in figure  1 , one can compute the minimum observation time and number of cycles for s / n=10 , @xmath106 , and any @xmath4 , based on the frequency at the isco and the projected total noise curve . a prograde encounter with a rapidly rotating smbh",
    "will go to higher frequencies during its inspiral than will an encounter with a nonrotating smbh .",
    "this increases the energy released in gravitational radiation and , importantly , increases the mass threshold at which the observed signal is in the most sensitive frequency range of the _ lisa _ band .",
    "the numbers in figure  1 are therefore conservative .",
    "the expected rate of such events depends on a number of uncertain astrophysical parameters .",
    "in particular , it is clear that the low mass end of smbh ( say @xmath107 ) is of great importance .",
    "yu & lu ( 2004 ) use the velocity dispersion data of sheth et al . ( 2003 ) to estimate that the comoving number density of black holes in this mass range is @xmath1few@xmath108  mpc@xmath62 .",
    "out to @xmath109  gpc ( where @xmath110 so redshift corrections are moderate ) , the volume of the universe is @xmath111  mpc@xmath112 , implying @xmath113 black holes in the required mass range . if on average @xmath114 imbh - smbh mergers per galaxy happen in @xmath115  yr , this implies an overall rate of a few percent of @xmath116 per year .",
    "the value of @xmath114 is highly uncertain .",
    "the @xmath117 relation ( e.g.,ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a , b ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) implies that the smbh typically contains @xmath118 of the mass of the central bulge , which means that @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath121% of this mass was originally in the form of young massive clusters ( which later merged with the bulge ) , and if a few tens of percent of such clusters form imbhs , this suggests @xmath122 over the lifetime of the galaxy . this is consistent with observations of actively interacting galaxies such as m82 , which have hundreds of super star clusters younger than @xmath123  yr and",
    "presumably have had many times that number over their lifetimes .",
    "note that the total mass added by such mergers is much less than the mass of an smbh , hence this number of mergers is not in conflict with limits based on the integrated light from quasars ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable that there will be several imbh - smbh mergers detectable with _",
    "lisa _ during its few year lifetime .",
    "the observable number and precision of inferences could change depending on the astrophysics involved .",
    "for example , if most massive clusters are formed at @xmath124 in accordance with the peak in the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. , madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1997 ) and their imbhs merge in @xmath1251  gyr with the smbh , then most mergers are at a high enough redshift that the frequencies are low and hence the s / n values are decreased . even in this case , the signal strength could be large enough that elaborate templates are unnecessary for detection ( see   4 ) .",
    "if in contrast the process of spiraling in and merging typically takes a few billion years , mergers will be distributed over time and a significant number of them will take place at low redshift when the s / n is high in just a few cycles .",
    "the maximum distance at which an imbh - smbh binary could be detected at @xmath126 ( with perfect signal processing ) can be estimated from equation ( 15 ) .",
    "the line of sight comoving distance saturates at high redshift ( see , e.g. , peebles 1993 , chapter 13 ) , to @xmath121  gpc for cosmological parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129  km  s@xmath58  mpc@xmath58 ( e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 ) . from equation ( 15 ) , the amplitude and observed frequency near the isco are then @xmath130 and @xmath131 , where @xmath132 and @xmath4 are measured in the rest frame . from larson et al .",

    "the scenario discussed in this paper relies on still uncertain details of the production and distribution of intermediate - mass black holes ( see miller & colbert 2004 for a discussion of formation mechanisms , and of issues such as wind losses in the formation of high mass stars ) .",
    "here we have focused on the particular idea that imbhs are formed in runaway collisions in clusters .",
    "other formation mechanisms have different implications .",
    "for example , madau & rees ( 2001 ) propose that imbhs form from the evolution of solitary nearly zero metallicity ( population iii ) stars in the early universe .",
    "in such a case , hierarchical merging of minihalos could produce multiple imbh - smbh mergers in the high redshift universe .",
    "however , at this point too little is known about such scenarios to make informed estimates of rates .",
    "our main point is that if even a few imbh - smbh mergers are detected they will be useful as uniquely precise tests of strong gravity .    to see this ,",
    "consider first the inspirals of stellar - mass black holes into supermassive black holes .",
    "these are promising as probes of the kerr spacetime , but a difficulty is that the waves are expected to be weak enough that thousands of orbits are required to achieve a reasonable signal to noise ( e.g. , barack & cutler 2004 ) . as a result , a very large number of templates are required to detect the signal , which could make analysis difficult . in contrast , if imbh - smbh mergers occur a few times per year , their signal strengths will lead to detections within just a few orbits , near the end of inspiral . as a result , as we now show , only standard fourier transforms are needed rather than any elaborate templates .",
    "consider the time for a nearly circular orbit to merge ( peters & mathews 1963 ; peters 1964 ) : @xmath137 for observation times @xmath138 , the change in gravitational wave frequency is @xmath139 .",
    "the frequency resolution is @xmath140 , so if @xmath141 the signal shows up as a single peak in a power density spectrum .",
    "therefore , if one observes for a coherence time @xmath142 ( such that @xmath143 ) , one has the maximum possible power in a single peak in a power density spectrum . in figure",
    "2 we show the signal to noise ratio for circular orbits over a coherence time for different unredshifted smbh masses ( assuming in each case @xmath106 ) , for observed frequencies from @xmath144  hz to @xmath145 , where we assume @xmath146  gpc and therefore @xmath147 . from this figure",
    "we see that if @xmath148 then a circular signal will be detectable with s / n@xmath14910 in a coherence time near the end of inspiral . if there are closer mergers , say with @xmath150  gpc , the signal to noise could be as large as hundreds .    as a result ,",
    "if imbh - smbh mergers occur , then during the end of inspiral they are detectable without modeling . at earlier times",
    "this is not the case , but it will be possible to use the late - time detections to work backwards and determine the full set of orbital parameters by connecting the phases of the individual segments",
    ". it will also be possible to establish very precise initial conditions for numerical modeling of the merger phase .",
    "some idea of the precision with which parameters will be estimated for such a merger ( after fitting a year - long wave train ) can be obtained from tables ii and iii of barack & cutler ( 2004 ) .",
    "linear scaling from these results is not appropriate , given correlations between parameters , but the much greater signal to noise ratio of imbh - smbh mergers ( thousands instead of tens ) suggests that , for example , the redshifted masses and the dimensionless angular momentum of the smbh will be estimated to fractional precisions of better than @xmath151 .    if the orbit is eccentric , or if other effects ( e.g. , pericenter precession or lense - thirring precession ) produce peaks separated in frequency by more than @xmath152 from the main peak , then the analysis is complicated somewhat .",
    "however , these frequencies will also remain stable over @xmath153 , so with high signal to noise one will be able to detect each of these peaks independently and model the changes in eccentricity , orbital inclination , and so on by building up the full wave train .",
    "as with mergers of stellar - mass with supermassive black holes , the orbits of imbhs into smbhs will map out the kerr spacetime and test the no - hair theorem ( e.g. , ryan 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , we point out that the rate of inspiral ( and decay of eccentricity if this is nonnegligible ) will provide a strict testbed for theoretical predictions of the flux and angular momentum functions in strong gravity . for example , for a @xmath154 binary , the total s / n is @xmath155 for the portion of the orbit inside of @xmath156 , so high - order contributions can be inferred empirically .    in future work",
    "we will proceed in two directions .",
    "first , we will explore the quantitative constraints on current post - newtonian models that are possible from detection of an imbh - smbh merger .",
    "second , we will investigate astrophysical scenarios in which the orbit would have significant eccentricity when the source is in the detectability band of _ lisa_. such eccentric orbits could arise from the scenario we discuss here , or from plunge orbits as in stellar - mass / supermassive mergers , or possibly from other mechanisms . if such scenarios are plausible , there is substantial extra information to be gleaned .",
    "virtually all templates constructed so far are specialized for ground - based detections of high - frequency waves , and hence assume that the orbits would have nearly circularized by the time the gravitational waves entered instrumental bands ( see , e.g. , damour , iyer , & sathyaprakash 2002 for an update to 3.5pn order ) .",

    "<S> recent observations and stellar dynamics simulations suggest that @xmath0 black holes can form in compact massive young star clusters . </S>",

    "<S> if such mergers are common , then future space - based gravitational wave detectors such as the laser interferometer space antenna will detect them with such a high signal to noise ratio that towards the end of the inspiral the orbits will be visible in a simple power density spectrum , without the need for matched filtering . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the astrophysics of the inspiral of clusters in the nuclear region of a galaxy and the subsequent merger of intermediate - mass with supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the prospects for understanding the spacetime geometry of rotating black holes , based on phase connection of the strong signals visible near the end of these extreme mass ratio inspirals . </S>"
