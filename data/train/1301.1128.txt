    "in classical constituent quark models , baryons are ascribed as three - quark ( @xmath0 ) states and mesons are ascribed as quark - anti - quark ( @xmath1 ) states .",
    "this picture is very successful in explaining properties of the spatial ground states of the flavor su(3 ) vector meson nonet , baryon octet and decuplet .",
    "its predicted @xmath2 baryon with mass around 1670 mev was discovered by later experiments . however even for the lowest spatial excited states , this picture failed badly in both meson and baryon sectors .    in the meson sector ,",
    "the lowest spatial excited su(3 ) nonet is the scalar nonet composed of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the classical constituent quark models ,",
    "these scalars should be @xmath7 states with @xmath3 as @xmath8 state , @xmath9 as @xmath10 state and @xmath6 as mainly @xmath11 state . then in this picture",
    ", it can not explain why the mass of @xmath5 is degenerate with @xmath6 instead of close to @xmath3 as in the @xmath12-@xmath13 case in the vector nonet .",
    "this made r.j.jaffe  @xcite proposing these scalars are @xmath14 states instead of @xmath1 states . in the new picture , the @xmath3",
    "is ascribed as @xmath15\\overline{[ud]}$ ] state , @xmath9 as @xmath16\\overline{[us]}-[ds]\\overline{[ds]})/\\sqrt{2}$ ] state and @xmath6 as @xmath16\\overline{[us]}+[ds]\\overline{[ds]})/\\sqrt{2}$ ] state .",
    "this gives a natural explanation of the degeneracy of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "$ ] means a good diquark with configuration of flavor representation @xmath18 , spin 0 and color @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively , these scalars are also proposed to be meson - meson dynamically generated states  @xcite .    in the baryon sector",
    ", the similar thing seems also happening  @xcite . in the classical quark models ,",
    "the excited baryon states are described as excitation of individual constituent quarks , similar to the cases for atomic and nuclear excitations .",
    "the lowest spatial excited baryon is expected to be a ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 state with one quark in orbital angular momentum @xmath22 state , and spin - parity @xmath23 .",
    "however , experimentally , the lowest negative parity @xmath21 resonance is found to be @xmath24 , which is heavier than two other spatial excited baryons : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this is the long - standing mass reverse problem for the lowest spatial excited baryons .    in the simple 3q constituent quark models ,",
    "it is also difficult to understand the strange decay properties of the @xmath24 , which seems to couple strongly to the final states with strangeness . besides a large coupling to @xmath27 , a large value of @xmath28",
    "is deduced  @xcite by a simultaneous fit to bes data on @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and cosy data on @xmath31 .",
    "there is also evidence for large @xmath32 coupling from @xmath33 reaction at clas  @xcite and @xmath34 reaction  @xcite , and large @xmath35 coupling from @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 reactions  @xcite .",
    "the third difficulty is the strange decay pattern of another member of the @xmath23-nonet , @xmath39 , which has its coupling to @xmath40 much larger than @xmath41 and @xmath42 according to its branching ratios listed in pdg  @xcite .",
    "all these difficulties can be easily understood by considering large 5-quark components in them  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 could be the lowest @xmath22 orbital excited @xmath43 state with a large admixture of @xmath44[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component having @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 in the ground state .",
    "the @xmath26 could be the lowest radial excited @xmath43 state with a large admixture of @xmath44[ud]\\bar d>$ ] pentaquark component having two @xmath15 $ ] diquarks in the relative p - wave . while the lowest @xmath22 orbital excited @xmath43 state should have a mass lower than the lowest radial excited @xmath43 state , the @xmath44[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component",
    "has a higher mass than @xmath44[ud]\\bar d>$ ] pentaquark component .",
    "the lighter @xmath47 is also understandable in this picture .",
    "its main 5-quark configuration is @xmath44[qs]\\bar q>$ ] which is lighter than the corresponding 5-quark configuration @xmath44[us]\\bar s>$ ] in the @xmath48 .",
    "the large mixture of the @xmath44[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component in the @xmath24 naturally results in its large couplings to the @xmath27 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the main 5-quark configuration for the @xmath39 is @xmath52[ds]\\bar s>$ ] which makes it heavier than other @xmath23 states and larger coupling to @xmath40 .    besides the penta - quark configurations with the diquark correlation",
    ", the penta - quark system may also be in the form of meson - baryon states .",
    "the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and some other baryon resonances are proposed to be meson - baryon dynamically generated states  @xcite .",
    "however , a challenge for this meson - baryon dynamical picture is to explain the mass and decay pattern of the @xmath39 .    from above facts and discussion for both meson and baryon sectors , one can see that unlike atomic and nuclear excitations where the number of constituent particles are fixed , the favorable hadronic excitation mechanism for the lowest spatial excited states in light quark sector seems to be dragging out a light @xmath1 pair from gluon field rather than to excite a constituent quark to be @xmath22 state .",
    "a breathing mode of @xmath53 is proposed  @xcite for the lowest @xmath23 baryon nonet .",
    "each baryon is a mixture of the three - quark and five - quark components .",
    "while the new picture gives a nice account of properties of scalar meson nonet and well - established members of the lowest @xmath23 baryon nonet , it is necessary to check its distinguishable predictions of other members in the @xmath23 baryon nonet .",
    "while the classical quenched quark models  @xcite predict the @xmath23 @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be around 1650 mev and 1760 mev , respectively , the unquenched quark models  @xcite expect them to be around 1400 mev and 1550 mev , respectively , and meson - baryon dynamical models  @xcite predict them to be around 1450 mev and 1620 mev , respectively .    for @xmath56 resonance with @xmath57 ,",
    "the pdg  @xcite lists a two - star @xmath58 resonance , which seems to support the quenched quark models .",
    "however , only four references listed in pdg show weak evidence for its existence . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the total cross sections for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are analyzed , which indicates some @xmath56 resonance around 1600 mev without @xmath61 quantum number .",
    "@xcite are based on multichannel analysis of the @xmath62 reactions .",
    "both claim evidence for a @xmath63 resonance with mass around 1620 mev but give contradicted coupling properties to @xmath64 and to @xmath65 .",
    "other later multichannel analyses of the @xmath62 reactions support the existence of an @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzes the reaction @xmath67 and gives two comparable solutions with and without @xmath68 .    on the other hand , there are also some supports of the unquenched 5-quark models with @xmath69 of much lower masses",
    ". the re - analysis of old data on @xmath70 finds hidden @xmath69 with mass around 1380 mev under the @xmath71 peak  @xcite . from an analysis of the recent leps data on @xmath72",
    "@xcite , there is also a possibility for the existence of such low mass @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of cebaf data on @xmath73 also suggests a possible @xmath69 around 1400 mev  @xcite .",
    "to clarify the situation for @xmath56 resonances , recently , a combined fit for the new cb data  @xcite on @xmath74 together with the old data  @xcite on @xmath75 for the energies from 1569 to 1676 mev was performed  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath76 reaction is the best channel available for the study of the @xmath56 resonances because the @xmath64 is a pure isospin 1 channel .",
    "the high precision crystal ball @xmath77 polarization data  @xcite are crucial for discriminating @xmath68 from @xmath78 .",
    "it shows that the @xmath79 is definitely needed , while @xmath68 is not needed at all .",
    "although @xmath80 is not demanded in this analysis , it can not be excluded .",
    "therefore , no evidence to support the classical quenched quark models at all from the @xmath23 baryons .",
    "additional @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 may exist .",
    "the @xmath81 is consistent with the resonance structure @xmath84 or @xmath85 in pdg  @xcite and seems a good isospin partner of @xmath86 .",
    "recently a very interesting narrow @xmath87 with a width about 1.5 mev was claimed from an analysis of @xmath88 data  @xcite .",
    "together with @xmath89 and either @xmath90 or @xmath91 , they fit in a nice @xmath92 baryon nonet with large penta - quark configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath93 as @xmath44\\{uq\\}\\bar q>$ ] state , @xmath94 as @xmath44\\{sq\\}\\bar q>$ ] state , @xmath95 as @xmath44\\{ss\\}\\bar s>$ ] state , and @xmath96 as @xmath44\\{ss\\}\\bar q>$ ] state",
    ". here @xmath97 means a diquark with configuration of flavor representation @xmath98 , spin 1 and color @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath95 as @xmath44\\{ss\\}\\bar s>$ ] state gives a natural explanation for its dominant @xmath99 decay mode with a very narrow width due to its very small phase space meanwhile a d - wave decay .",
    "the available information on the hadron spectroscopy with strangeness strongly indicates that @xmath100 in s - state is more favorable than @xmath0 state with @xmath22 and @xmath101 in s - state is more favorable than @xmath1 state with @xmath22 .",
    "the multi - quark components are very substantial and important for hadronic excited states .",
    "even @xmath102 configuration may play dominant role for some baryon resonances  @xcite .    to further establish the multi - quark picture for hadronic excited states ,",
    "it is very important to complete the low - lying hyperon spectrum , especially the @xmath23 and @xmath92 @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath103 .",
    "here the @xmath103 spectrum has a unique advantage that the favorable @xmath1 excitations from quark sea have different flavor from the valence strange quarks  @xcite .",
    "kaon beam experiment at jparc and hyperon production from charmonium decays at besiii may play very important role in this aspect .",
    "it is also important to check the cases with @xmath104 quarks replaced by @xmath105 or @xmath106 quarks .",
    "various pictures and dynamics for the spectroscopy with strangeness can be extended to and checked by its charm and beauty partners .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 is a @xmath107 molecule mainly due to light vector meson exchange force  @xcite , then with the same mechanism there should also exist @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 molecules  @xcite .",
    "the newly established @xmath112 is regarded as a @xmath108 molecule or tetra - quark state by many people  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath113 was proposed to be a @xmath114 molecule  @xcite ; now the newly established @xmath115 is regarded as its @xmath116 partner  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath117 was proposed  @xcite to be @xmath118 molecule as the charm partner of @xmath119 .",
    "although many hadron resonances were proposed to be hadron - hadron dynamically generated states or multi - quark states , most of them can not be clearly distinguished from classical quark model states due to tunable ingredients and possible large mixing of various configurations in these models . even in 2010 ,",
    "the pdg  @xcite still claimed that ",
    "the clean @xmath120 spectrum has in fact been taken to settle the decades - long discussion about the nature of the @xmath119  true 3-quark state or mere @xmath121 threshold effect ?",
    " unambiguously in favor of the first interpretation .",
    "\" a possible solution to this problem is to extend the penta - quark study to the hidden charm and hidden beauty sectors . if the @xmath24 is the @xmath122 quasi - bound state with hidden strangeness , then naturally by replacing @xmath123 by @xmath124 or @xmath125 one would expect super - heavy @xmath21 states with hidden charm and hidden beauty just below @xmath126 and @xmath127 thresholds , respectively .",
    "following the valencia approach of ref.@xcite and extending it to the hidden charm sector , the interaction between various charmed mesons and charmed baryons were studied with the local hidden gauge formalism in refs.@xcite .",
    "several meson - baryon dynamically generated narrow @xmath21 and @xmath128 resonances with hidden charm are predicted with mass around 4.3 gev and width smaller than 100 mev .",
    "the s - wave @xmath129 and @xmath130 states with isospin i=1/2 and spin s=1/2 were also investigated by various other approaches  @xcite .",
    "they confirm that the interaction between @xmath131 and @xmath132 is attractive and results in a @xmath129 bound state not far below threshold .",
    "the low - lying energy spectra of five quark systems @xmath133 ( @xmath134=@xmath135 , @xmath136=@xmath137 ) and @xmath138 ( @xmath134=@xmath137 , @xmath136=@xmath139 ) are also investigated with three kinds of schematic interactions : the chromomagnetic interaction , the flavor - spin dependent interaction and the instanton - induced interaction  @xcite . in all the three models , the lowest five quark state ( @xmath133 or @xmath138 )",
    "has an orbital angular momentum @xmath140 and the spin - parity @xmath141 ; the mass of the lowest @xmath138 state is heavier than the lowest @xmath133 state , which is different from the prediction of meson - baryon dynamical model  @xcite .",
    "the predicted new resonances definitely can not be accommodated by quark models with three constituent quarks . because these predicted states have masses above @xmath142 and @xmath143 thresholds , they can be looked for at the forthcoming panda / fair and jlab 12-gev upgrade experiments .",
    "this is an advantage for their experimental searches , compared with those baryons with hidden charms below the @xmath142 threshold proposed by other earlier approaches  @xcite .",
    "the same meson - baryon coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge formalism was extended to the hidden beauty sector in ref.@xcite .",
    "two @xmath144 states and four @xmath145 states were predicted to be dynamically generated .",
    "because of the hidden @xmath146 components involved in these states , the masses of these states are all above 11 gev while their widths are of only a few mev , which should form part of the heaviest island for the quite stable @xmath21 and @xmath128 baryons . for the valencia approach",
    ", the static limit is assumed for the t - channel exchange of light vector mesons by neglecting momentum dependent terms . in order to investigate the possible influence of the momentum dependent terms ,",
    "the conventional schrodinger equation approach was also used to study possible bound states for the @xmath127 channel by keeping the momentum dependent terms in the t - channel meson exchange potential .",
    "it was found that within the reasonable model parameter range the two approaches give consistent predictions about possible bound states .",
    "this gives some justification of the simple valencia approach although there could be an uncertainty of 10 - 20 mev for the binding energies .",
    "production cross sections of the predicted @xmath147 resonances in @xmath148 and @xmath149 collisions were estimated as a guide for the possible experimental search at relevant facilities in the future . for the @xmath150 reaction , the best center - of - mass energy for observing the predicted @xmath147 is @xmath151 gev , where the production cross section is about 0.01 nb . for the @xmath152 reaction ,",
    "when the center - of - mass energy is larger than 14 gev , the production cross section should be larger than 0.1 nb .",
    "nowadays , the luminosity for pp or ep collisions can reach @xmath153 , this will produce more than 1000 events per day for the @xmath147 production .",
    "it is expected that future facilities , such as proposed electron - ion collider ( eic ) , may discover these very interesting super - heavy @xmath21 and @xmath128 with hidden beauty .",
    "very recently , the observation of the iso - vector meson partners of the predicted @xmath147 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , were reported by belle collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this gives us stronger confidence on the existence of the super - heavy island for the @xmath147 and @xmath156 resonances .",
    "available information on hadron spectroscopy with strangeness and charm reveals unquenched quark picture . dragging out a @xmath1 from gluon field is a very important excitation mechanism for hadrons . to correctly describe the hadron spectrum ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the classical quenched quark models which assuming a fixed number of constituent quarks .",
    "distinguishable prediction for hyperon spectroscopy from the new picture is yelling for experimental confirmation .",
    "kaon beam experiments at jparc and hyperon production data from charmonium decays at besiii can play very important role here .",
    "super - heavy narrow @xmath21 and @xmath128 resonances are predicted by various models to exist around 4.3 gev and 11 gev for hidden charm and beauty , respectively .",
    "their iso - vector meson partners @xmath154 and @xmath155 have recently been observed .",
    "experimental confirmation of them will unambiguously establish multi - quark dynamics .",
    "they can be looked for at cebaf-12gev - upgrade at jlab and panda at fair , maybe also at jparc , super - b , rhic , eic .",
