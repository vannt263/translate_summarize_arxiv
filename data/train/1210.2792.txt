    "the main tool is theorem [ generalresult ] which gives a sufficient condition for multipliers associated with difference schemes approximating the fractional derivative to lead to stable schemes with desirable smoothing . in particular , we show in proposition [ thm : spg ] that stability for a numerical scheme using to solve the cauchy problem @xmath17 with @xmath18 can only be achieved for a unique shift @xmath19 ; i.e. it is necessary that @xmath20 for @xmath21 to generate bounded semigroups on @xmath5 where the bound is uniform in @xmath22 .",
