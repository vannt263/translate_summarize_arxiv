    "quantization of charge is a very basic feature in the description of the physical world .",
    "therefore , fractionally charged excitations came as a surprise to physicists . already back in the year 1979 , su , schrieffer , and heeger @xcite showed that a model describing the one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain molecule trans  polyacetylene @xmath1 supports excitations with spin  charge separation .",
    "this is not yet charge fractionalization , but when the model is considered at different electron densities ( corresponding to extremely high doping ) , it turns out that at certain filling factors elementary excitations with fractional charge exist [ in the simplest case @xmath2and @xmath3 .",
    "a few years later , laughlin @xcite interpreted the much celebrated fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in terms of fractionally charged ( quasi- ) particles ( fcp ) and fractionally charged ( quasi- ) holes ( fch ) .",
    "thereby , he firmly established the idea of fractional charges in our understanding of solid  state physics .",
    "direct electron ",
    "electron interactions are crucial in the fqhe : correlations become strong in an applied magnetic field because the kinetic energy of the electrons is quenched . of course",
    ", no one will ever extract a fraction of an electron from an fqhe sample .",
    "but thinking of an extra electron or an extra hole near fill factor @xmath4 as decaying into three separate entities of charge @xmath2each proved enormously helpful for a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the fqhe  and was rewarded by the nobel prize in physics 1998 .",
    "the question was left open whether or not fractionally charged excitations exist in 2d or 3d systems without a magnetic field . in 2002 ,",
    "it was suggested by one of us @xcite that excitations with charge @xmath0 do exist in certain 2d and 3d lattices , e.g. , the pyrochlore lattice , which is a prototype 3d structure with geometrical frustration .",
    "the original work was motivated by the transition metal compound @xmath5 , which surprisingly shows heavy ",
    "fermion behavior with , e.g. , a large @xmath6  coefficient in the low - temperature specific heat @xmath7.@xcite however , we will not address the issue whether the models discussed here apply to any particular material or artifical systems such as optical lattices , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and citations therein . instead",
    ", we try to contribute to the very general question whether or not fractional charges can exist at all in truly 2d or 3d systems in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "we would like to argue that general prerequisites for fractional charges are  as in the fqhe case ",
    "strong short  range correlations and certain band fillings .",
    "furthermore , the short  range correlations should be somehow incompatible with the lattice structure in order to prevent the development of long  range order .",
    "following the general usage , we will simply call the lattice `` frustrated '' even though calling the interaction `` frustrated by the lattice '' would be the more accurate terminology .    in this contribution , we study the charge degrees of freedom on such lattices systematically and consider a class of models of strongly correlated spinless fermions .",
    "most of our numerical calculations were done for the 2d checkerboard lattice , which is easier to deal with than the even more interesting 3d cases . for future work",
    ", one can hope to learn from comparison with spin systems where numerous studies exist for the pyrochlore lattice and its 2d relatives , the crisscrossed checkerboard lattice and the kagome lattice.@xcite",

    "a lorentzian broadening @xmath15 is used.[cap : spectral - density_gg ]    we checked numerically that in the limit of large @xmath16 , it is sufficient to calculate the spectral functions within the minimal hilbert space .",
    "this enables us to study rather large systems and to address the question whether or not the two defects created by injecting one particle are closely bound to one another or not .",
    "the concept of a spatial separation of fcp s can be confirmed by comparing results within the minimal hilbert space with those from an artificially restricted calculation in which a particle is prevented from decaying into two defects with charge @xmath17 each . in our finite ",
    "cluster calculations , a broad low  energy continuum is seen in the spectral functions for the unrestricted case , which is missing when the restriction is imposed.@xcite the respective bandwidths are about @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests a simple interpretation : the dynamics of two separated fcp s having a bandwidth of @xmath20 each due to six nearest neighbors would explain the calculated @xmath18 , while a confined added particle has a much smaller bandwidth @xmath19 , which is close to @xmath21 .",
    "further insight can be obtained if the amplitude of the ring exchange @xmath12=@xmath22 in the effective hamiltonian is considered an independent parameter which is no longer restricted to the regime @xmath12@xmath23@xmath11 as enforced by @xmath11@xmath23@xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ cap : spectral - density_gg ] compares results for the `` physical '' regime corresponding to the previously considered parameters @xmath24 with those for @xmath25 . in the latter case",
    ", the broad continuum at the bottom of the spectral density vanishes and a sharp @xmath26peak evolves instead .",
    "the latter should be viewed as a landau quasi - particle peak .",
    "this suggests the following interpretation : the ring exchange term leads for the undoped case to charge order , which in finite ",
    "cluster calculations is destroyed when a particle is added by the separation of the two fcp s .",
    "these are weakly bound to each other . if @xmath12@xmath23@xmath11 , the distance of the two fcp s is larger than the system size considered and thus the excitations seem to be deconfined .",
    "an artificially increased @xmath12 leads to much stronger confinement and the diameter of the bounded pair becomes smaller or comparable to the system size .",
    "the pair acts at low energies as one entity .",
    "the electron as a ( however strongly modified ) `` particle '' is recovered and a finite weight of the quasi - particle peak results .",
    "these findings suggest that for the physical regime @xmath27 quasi - particles with a spatial extent over more than hundred lattice sites are formed .",
    "the huge spatial extent is expected to lead to interesting effect .",
    "e.g. , one may find with increasing doping concentration a transition from a `` confined '' phase to an `` fcp plasma '' phase with yet unknown properties when the average distance of bound fcp ",
    "fcp pairs falls below the diameter of a single bound fcp pair .",
    "other open questions for future research include a thorough investigation of the 3d pyrochlore lattice .",
    "even though the checkerboard lattice and pyrochlore lattice show many similarities , there exist certain differences between them , e.g. , due to the higher spatial dimensionality.@xcite here , differences of the two lattices arise in the u(1 ) gauge theory which describes the low energy excitations of the considered systems .",
    "the related compact electrodynamic is always confining in 2 + 1 dimensions while it allows for the existence of a deconfined phase in 3 + 1 dimension.@xcite systematic exact diagonalization studies as well as the application of monte carlo techniques will provide a deeper insight and we hope to confirm the expected existence of a deconfined phase in a 3d pyrochlore lattice .",
    "in addition , a natural extension of the model considered in this paper is the inclusion of spin .",
    "this leads to a more realistic model and could provide a better link to experiments .",
