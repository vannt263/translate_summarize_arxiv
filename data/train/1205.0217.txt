    "achieving high - precision control over quantum dynamics in the presence of decoherence and operational errors is a fundamental goal across coherence - enabled quantum sciences and technologies . in particular , realizing a universal set of quantum gates with sufficiently low error rate is a prerequisite for fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "open - loop control based on time - dependent modulation of the system dynamics has been extensively explored as a physical - layer error - control strategy to meet this challenge .",
    "two main approaches have been pursued to date : on the one hand , if the underlying open - system relaxation dynamics is fully known , powerful variational techniques and/or numerical algorithms from optimal quantum control theory ( oct ) may be invoked to optimize the target gate fidelity , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for representative contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamically corrected gates ( dcgs ) @xcite have been introduced having maximum design simplicity and _ portability _ in mind : close in spirit to well - established dynamical decoupling techniques for quantum state preservation in non - markovian environments @xcite , dcg sequences can achieve a substantially smaller net decoherence error than individual `` primitive '' gates by making minimal reference to the details of the system and control specifications . in principle",
    ", the use of recursive control design makes it possible for the final accuracy to be solely limited by the shortest achievable control time scale @xcite .",
    "remarkably , simple dcg constructions underly the fidelity improvement reported for spin - motional entangling gates in recent trapped - ion experiments @xcite .",
    "while obtaining a detailed quantitative characterization of the noise mechanisms to overcome is imperative to guarantee truly _ optimal _ control performance , this remains practically challenging for many open quantum systems of interest .",
    "in addition , current approaches for applying oct methods to _ non - markovian _ environments rely on obtaining suitable simplifications of the open - system equations of motion ( e.g. , via identification of a finite - dimensional markovian embedding @xcite or approximation through time - local coupled linear equations @xcite )  which may be technically challenging and/or involve non - generic assumptions . since in dcg schemes the error cancellation is engineered at the level of the _ full _ system - plus - environment hamiltonian evolution , two significant advantages arise : environment operators may be treated _ symbolically _ , avoiding the need for an explicit equation of motion for the reduced dynamics to be derived ; in contrast to error - control approaches designed in terms of gate propagators ( notably , fully compensating composite pulses for systematic control errors @xcite ) , working at the hamiltonian level allows to more directly relate to physical error mechanisms and operational constraints . despite incorporating realistic requirements of finite maximum control rates and amplitudes ,",
    "analytic dcg constructions nonetheless rely on the assumption that complete control over the target system can be afforded through a universal set of _ stretchable _ control hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "this requirement is typically too strong for laboratory settings where only a _ limited _ set of control hamiltonians can be turned on / off with sufficient precision and speed , and universality also relies on internal always - on hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore , portability comes at the expenses of longer sequence durations , making dcgs more vulnerable to uncompensated markovian decoherence mechanisms .    in this work",
    ", we introduce a control methodology that results in an _ automated _ recipe for synthesizing dcgs via numerical search .",
    "this is accomplished by relaxing the portability requirement and utilizing the full details of the control .",
    "while the resulting `` automated dcgs '' ( adcgs ) are still synthesized without _ quantitative _ knowledge of the underlying error sources , they overcome the restrictive assumptions of analytical schemes and lead to drastically shorter sequences . as an additional key advantage ,",
    "our hamiltonian - engineering formulation lends itself naturally to incorporating robustness against multiple error sources , that can enter the controlled open - system hamiltonian in either additive or multiplicative fashion .",
    "this allows for adcgs to _ simultaneously _ cancel non - markovian decoherence _ and _ control errors , as long as the combined effects remain perturbatively small .",
    "we quantitatively demonstrate these advantages by focusing on a highly constrained control scenario  the two - electron singlet - triplet ( s - t@xmath0 ) spin qubit in gaas quantum dots ( qds)@xcite . in spite of ground - breaking experimental advances @xcite , boosting single - qubit gate fidelities is imperative for further progress towards scalable quantum computation and is attracting intense theoretical effort @xcite .",
    "recently introduced supcode composite - pulse sequences @xcite , for instance , are ( analytically ) designed to achieve insensitivity against decoherence induced by coupling to the surrounding nuclear - spin bath , however they do not incorporate robustness against voltage noise , which is an important limitation in experiments @xcite . here , we provide explicit adcg sequences for high - fidelity universal control in s - t@xmath0 qubits , which cancel the dominant decoherence and exchange - control errors , while respecting the stringent timing and pulsing constraints of realistic s - t@xmath0 devices .",
    "the resulting sequences use a very _ small _ number of control variables and a _ fixed _ base pulse profile , which streamlines their experimental implementation .",
    "up to two orders of magnitude improvement in gate fidelities are predicted for parameter regimes appropriate for current experimental conditions .",
    "we consider in general a @xmath1-dimensional target quantum system @xmath2 coupled to an environment ( bath ) @xmath3 , whose total hamiltonian @xmath4 on @xmath5 reads @xmath6\\otimes { \\mathbb i}_b + h_e ,   \\label{ham0 } \\\\",

    "the total `` error hamiltonian '' @xmath10 encompasses the bath hamiltonian , unwanted interactions with the bath , as well as deviations of the applied control hamiltonian from @xmath9 , subject to the requirement that the underlying correlation times are sufficiently long .",

    "similarly , we characterize the independent error sources in @xmath9 by letting @xmath25 where @xmath26 are known system operators , while the parameters @xmath27 remain unspecified . for notational convenience , we shall label all the unknown parameters symbolically and collectively by @xmath28 .    in an ideal error - free scenario , @xmath29",
    ", the system evolves directly under the action of the control , in the presence of its internal drift hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that in this limit , @xmath2 is _ completely controllable _ , that is , arbitrary unitary transformations on @xmath2 can be synthesized as `` primitive gates '' by suitably designing @xmath9 in conjunction with @xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned , we are particularly interested in the situation where the latter is essential for controllability to be achieved @xcite . the available control resources may be specified by describing @xmath30 in terms of the admissible ( nominal ) control inputs and hamiltonians . beside restrictions on the set of tunable hamiltonians",
    "@xmath31 , limited `` pulse - shaping '' capabilities will typically constrain the control inputs @xmath32 as system - dependent features of the control hardware . for concreteness",
    ", we assume here that @xmath9 is decomposed as a sequence of shape - constrained pulses applied back to back and also constrain pulse amplitudes @xmath33 and durations @xmath34 to technological limitations such as @xmath35 .    ideally , if the target unitary gate is @xmath36 , the objective for gate synthesis is to devise a control hamiltonian @xmath9 such that ( up to a phase ) , @xmath37 , \\label{psynthesis}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 denotes time ordering and @xmath39 is the running time of the control .",

    "the epg in turn upper - bounds the fidelity loss between the ideal and actual evolution on @xmath2 once its `` pure - bath '' components are removed .",
    "more concretely , define @xmath49 that is , a projector that removes the pure - bath terms in @xmath50 ( note that mod@xmath51 if @xmath50 is a pure - system operator of the form @xmath52 , as for a classical bath ) .",
    "then the following ( not tight ) upper bound for the ( uhlman ) fidelity loss holds _ independently _ of the initial states",
    "@xcite : @xmath53}^{(\\delta ) } \\vert .\\ ] ] thus , reducing the epg can be used as a proxy for reducing gate fidelity loss . while for a primitive gate implementation",

    "recall that two main requirements are required in first - order analytical dcg constructions @xcite : ( i ) primitive gate implementations of the generators of a `` decoupling group '' associated with the algebraic structure of epgs and ( ii ) particular implementations of the target gate @xmath36 ( as @xmath55 ) and the identity gate ( as @xmath56 ) as sequences of primitive gates such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 share the _ same _ first - order epg , making them a `` balance pair '' .",
    "while ( i ) is provided by controllability and leads directly to a constructive procedure for correcting to the first - order the identity evolution , ( ii ) is essential for modifying this procedure in such a way that the net first - order error cancellation is maintained , but @xmath36 is effected instead .",
    "generating balance pairs require further adjustment of gate control parameters to form a _ controllable relationship _ between epgs of gate implementations , holding as an identity regardless of the value of @xmath48 ( or @xmath20 ) .",
    "for example , in the absence of drift dynamics and control errors , such a controllable relationship can be engineered by `` stretching '' pulse profiles in time while the amplitudes are reduced proportionally , resulting in different realizations of the _ same _ target , with epgs that scale linearly with the gate duration .",
    "similarly , in the presence of a multiplicative control error , primitive gates with physically equivalent ( modulo @xmath57 ) angles of rotation result in different epgs ( note that similar geometric ideas are used in designing composite pulses @xcite ) .",
    "we argue next that knowing the control description and marking the error sources @xmath58 does still lead to ( ii ) as long as control constraints allow us to tap into a continuum of different gate implementations .    the multitude of pathways for realizing a primitive gate @xmath36 increases with gate duration / subsegments as a result of availability of more control choices and ultimately a simpler control landscape @xcite .",
    "assume that ( a1 ) such primitive implementations may be parametrized as @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "we aim to show that a balance pair or , alternatively , a direct cancellation of the epg of @xmath36 may be found . the gist of our argument is most easily given for a single qubit , with the pauli operators chosen as the operator basis @xmath60 for error expansion .",
    "using the fact that the interactions among different error sources can be ignored up to the first order , the basic idea is to start with the first error source , @xmath61 , and then use the resulting gates recursively for the next error source until all error sources are exhausted . ignoring error sources other than @xmath61 ,",

    "we remark that assumption ( a2 ) essentially implies that the domain of the errors as a function of implementation parameters for a fixed unitary gate is not compact , so that arbitrary magnitudes of each error component can be sampled by appropriately choosing the implementation parameters .",
    "such arbitrary large domains need not not exist in the primitive gate implementations ( naturally or due to constraints ) , or only discrete error values may be reachable .",

    "the epg associated with @xmath79 has then a continuos domain .",
    "clearly , applying @xmath78 followed by the target gate @xmath36 still realizes the gate @xmath36 but the resulting epg is now given by @xmath80 , which is parametrized by @xmath76 . by applying sufficiently many copies of @xmath78 before applying @xmath36 ,",
    "the error can be extended to arbitrary large domains as desired .",
    "the adcg sequences generated by following the above existential argument tend to be far too long and complex to be useful in realistic control scenarios . also note that in principle , the construction of single- or two - qubit dcgs in @xmath81-qubit registers may be handled similarly by using multi - qubit pauli operators as a basis for epg expansion and for building projection blocks .",

    "<S> dynamically corrected gates are extended to non - markovian open quantum systems where limitations on the available controls and/or the presence of control noise make existing analytical approaches unfeasible . </S>",
    "<S> a computational framework for the synthesis of dynamically corrected gates is formalized that allows sensitivity against non - markovian decoherence and control errors to be perturbatively minimized via numerical search , resulting in robust gate implementations . </S>",
    "<S> explicit sequences for achieving universal high - fidelity control in a singlet - triplet spin qubit subject to realistic system and control constraint are provided , which simultaneously cancel to the leading order the dephasing due to non - markovian nuclear - bath dynamics and voltage noise affecting the control fields . </S>",
    "<S> substantially improved gate fidelities are predicted for current laboratory devices . </S>"
