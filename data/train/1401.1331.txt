    "usually the evaluation points @xmath3 are chosen from the whole field @xmath6 .",
    "however , here , motivated by the links and possible applications to the recently introduced himmo key distribution scheme  @xcite , we concentrate on a very different case , which has never been discussed in the literature .",
    "namely , in the settings relevant to himmo , the values of @xmath3 are taken from a short interval rather than from the whole field @xmath6 .",
    "this case requires a careful adaptation of existing algorithms of  @xcite and also establishing new number theoretic results about the frequency of small residues of polynomial values evaluated at a small argument , which are based on some ideas from  @xcite .",
    "we remark the polynomial recovery problem as studied in this paper arises in a collusion attack on a single node in the himmo system .",
    "collusion attacks on the complete himmo system lead to recovery problems involving several polynomials reduced modulo several distinct unknown integers , which we believe to be much more difficult .      for a prime @xmath2",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the field of @xmath2 elements .",
    "we identify the elements of @xmath6 with the set @xmath7 , so we can talk about their bits ( for example most and least significant bits ) and also approximations .",
    "we consider the _ noisy polynomial interpolation problem _ of finding an unknown polynomial @xmath8,\\ ] ] of degree @xmath9 from approximations to values of @xmath1 ( treated as elements of the set @xmath7 ) at polynomially many points @xmath10 selected uniformly at random .",
    "more precisely , for integers @xmath11 and @xmath12 we denote by @xmath13 the distance between @xmath11 and the closest multiple of @xmath14 , that is , @xmath15 then , these approximations can , for example , be given as integers @xmath16 with @xmath17 for some `` precision '' @xmath18 for values of @xmath3 that are chosen uniformly at random from a certain set @xmath19 of `` samples '' .    in cryptographic applications ,",
    "the approximations are usually given by strings of @xmath11 most or least significant bits of @xmath1 , where , if necessary , some leading zeros are added to make sure that @xmath1 is represented by @xmath20 bits , where @xmath20 is the bit length of @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that giving the most significant bits is essentially equivalent to giving approximations of the type   with an appropriate @xmath18 .",
    "we now observe that giving the least significant bits can be recast as a question of this type as well . indeed , assume we are given some @xmath11-bit integer @xmath21 so that @xmath22 for some ( unknown ) integer @xmath23 .",
    "we now have @xmath24 so , if @xmath25 is the multiplicative inverse of @xmath26 in @xmath6 then , setting @xmath27 , we obtain an inequality of the type   with the polynomial @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "so from now on we concentrate on the case where the approximations to @xmath1 are given in the form of  .",
    "the case of linear polynomials corresponds to the hidden number problem introduced by boneh and venkatesan  @xcite .",
    "the case of general polynomials , including sparse polynomials of very large degree , has been studied in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a survey of several other problems of similar types ) .",
    "we note that if the polynomial @xmath5 belongs to some family @xmath31 of polynomials ( such as polynomials of degree @xmath32 or sparse polynomials with @xmath32 monomials ) , it is crucial for the algorithms of  @xcite to have some uniformity results for every non - zero polynomial of @xmath31 on the values of @xmath3 chosen uniformly at random from @xmath19 .",
    "we also note that a multiplicative analogue of this problem has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the settings of all previous works , typically the set @xmath19 is the whole field @xmath6 . in turn , this enables the use of such a powerful number theoretic technique as the method of exponential sums and thus the use of the weil bound ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.38 ) ) for dense polynomials and the bound of cochrane , pinner and rosenhouse  @xcite for sparse polynomials .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite a polynomial time algorithm is designed that works with very large values of @xmath18 , namely , up to @xmath33 , provided that @xmath5 is a sparse polynomial of degree @xmath34 and with @xmath35 monomials ( of known degrees ) , where @xmath36 is some absolute constant .",
    "the analysis of the algorithm of  @xcite is based on the method of exponential sums , the bound of  @xcite and some ideas related to the waring problem .",
    "we also note that if @xmath19 is an interval of length at least @xmath37 for some fixed @xmath38 , where , as before @xmath39 , then one can use the method of  @xcite augmented with the bounds of exponential sums obtained via the method of vinogradov , see the striking results of wooley  @xcite",
    ". however , here we are interested in shorter intervals of the form @xmath40,\\ ] ] which appear naturally in the construction of  @xcite .",
    "thus instead of the method of exponential sums , we use some ideas from  @xcite .",
    "we remark that for the noisy interpolation to succeed , we always assume that some low order the coefficients @xmath41 of @xmath5 are known , where @xmath42 is such that @xmath43 for some fixed @xmath38 .",
    "clearly such a condition is necessary as if @xmath44 then the approximations of the type   are not likely to be sufficient to distinguish between @xmath45 from approximations   at random @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that without loss of generality we can always assume that @xmath47 note that in the case when the test set @xmath19 is the whole field @xmath6 we only need to request that the constant coefficient @xmath48 of @xmath5 is known ( which is also , always assumed to be zero , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the above example , which shows the limits of _ interpolation _ of @xmath5 from the information given by  , motivates the following question of _ approximation _ to @xmath5 , which is also more relevant to attacking himmo .",
    "namely , instead of finding a polynomial @xmath5 we ask whether we can find a polynomial @xmath49 , such that @xmath1 and @xmath50 are close to each other for all @xmath46 $ ] so the approximations   do not allow to distinguish between @xmath5 and @xmath49 . in the terminology of  @xcite both @xmath5 and @xmath49 lead to the same keys and thus the attacker can use @xmath49 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that the algorithmic problems considered in this paper have led us to some new problems which are of intrinsic number theoretic interest .",
    "generally , our approach follows that of  @xcite which in turn is based on the idea of boneh and venkatesan  @xcite .",
    "thus lattice algorithms , namely the algorithm for the closest vector problem , see section  [ sec : lat cvp ] , and a link between this problem and polynomial approximations , see section  [ sec : lap poly ] , play a crucial role in our approach .",
    "however , the analysis of our algorithm requires very different tools compared with those used in  @xcite . namely we need to establish some results about the frequency of small polynomial values at small arguments , which we derive in section  [ sec : polyval ] , closely following some ideas from  @xcite .",
    "it also clear that there is a natural limit for such estimates on the frequency of small values as any polynomial with small coefficients takes small values at small arguments ( it is certainly easy to quantify the notion of `` small '' in this statement ) .",
    "in fact our bound of lemma  [ lem : nfij-1 ] is nontrivial up to exactly this limit .",
    "rather unexpectently , in section  [ sec : except poly ] we show that there are several other types of polynomials which satisfy this property : that is , they take small values at small arguments even if the coefficients are quite large ( certainly this may only happen beyond the range of the bound of lemma  [ lem : nfij-1 ] which applies to all polynomials ) .",
    "we call such polynomials _ exceptional_. then , after recalling in section  [ sec : prep ] some result from analytic number theory , in section  [ sec : coeff except ] we give some results describing the structure of the coefficients of exceptional polynomials . note the presence of exceptional polynomials makes noisy polynomial interpolation impossible for a wide class of instances ( which is actually good news for the security of himmo )",
    ". so it is important to understand the structure and the frequency of exceptional polynomials .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : coeff except ] provide some partial progress toward this goal , yet many important questions are still widely open .",
    "our main results are presented in sections  [ sec : poly int ] and  [ sec : poly app ] . in section  [ sec : poly int ] we treat the noisy polynomial interpolation problem , where we actually want to recover the hidden polynomial @xmath5 .",
    "however , from the cryptographic point of view it is enough to recover another polynomial @xmath51 which for all or most of small arguments takes values close to those taken by @xmath5 . here",
    "the existence of exceptional polynomials becomes of primal importance .",
    "we use the results of section  [ sec : coeff except ] to obtain an upper bound on the number of such polynomials @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , in sections  [ sec : flat poly ] and  [ sec : oscill poly ] we also give two interesting explicit constructions of such exceptional polynomials , which we illustrate by some concrete numerical examples .    in section  [ sec : poly app ] we treat the approximate recovery problem and give a formula that predicts whether an approximate recovery is likely to be successful , depending on the number of randomly chosen observation points .",
    "we compare its predictions with numerical experiments for parameter values suitable for himmo .      throughout the paper , the implied constants in the symbols ` @xmath52 ' , ` @xmath53 ' and ` @xmath54 ' may occasionally , where obvious , depend on the degrees of the polynomials involved and on the real parameter @xmath55 and are absolute , otherwise .",
    "we recall that the notations @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are all equivalent to the assertion that the inequality @xmath59 holds for some constant @xmath36 .",
    "the letter @xmath2 always denotes a prime number , while the letters @xmath60 , @xmath42 , @xmath61 , @xmath14 and @xmath9 ( in lower and upper cases ) always denote positive integer numbers .",
    "for a polynomial @xmath62\\ ] ] and two intervals @xmath63 of @xmath64 and @xmath65 consecutive integers , respectively , we denote by @xmath66 the number of values @xmath67 for which @xmath68 ( where the elements of the intervals @xmath69 and @xmath70 are embedded into @xmath6 under the natural reduction modulo @xmath2 ) .    for two intervals @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the same length ,",
    "various bounds on @xmath66 are given in  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the argument of the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) allows us to estimate @xmath66 for intervals of @xmath69 and @xmath70 of different lengths as well .    to present this result , for positive integers @xmath42 , @xmath61 and @xmath64 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath71 the number of solutions to the system of equations @xmath72 with @xmath73 next , we define @xmath74 as the smallest integer @xmath75 such that for @xmath76 there exists a constant @xmath77 depending only on @xmath42 and @xmath61 and such that @xmath78 holds as @xmath79 . presently , the strongest available upper bound @xmath80 is due to wooley  @xcite , see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.1 ) and  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1.1 ) ; note that , in particular , these bounds also imply the existence of @xmath74 which is a very nontrivial fact .",
    "it is now easy to see that the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) can be generalised to lead to the following bound .",
    "[ lem : nfij-1 ] let @xmath81 $ ] be a polynomial of degree @xmath61 . then for intervals @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 we have @xmath85 as @xmath86",
    "note that kerr  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) gives a more general form of lemma  [ lem : nfij-1 ] that applies to multivariate polynomials and also to congruences modulo a composite number .",
    "we also note , that several other results from  @xcite can be extended from the case @xmath87 to the general case as well , but this does not affect our main result .",
    "clearly the bound of lemma  [ lem : nfij-1 ] is nontrivial provided that @xmath88 and also @xmath89 for a fixed @xmath38 and a sufficiently large @xmath64 .",
    "it is easy to see that this conditions can not be substantially improved as it is clear that if @xmath90 then @xmath91 for any polynomial @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "also , if @xmath92 then @xmath91 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the above example may suggest that unless the coefficients of @xmath96 are small , the value of @xmath97 can be nontrivially estimated even for @xmath98 .",
    "we now show that this is false and in fact there are many other polynomials , which we call _ exceptional _ , which have the same property .",
    "let us fix integers @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "taking @xmath11 to be small , we see that @xmath96 has quite large coefficients , however no nontrivial bound on @xmath97 is possible for @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , in sections  [ sec : flat poly ] and  [ sec : oscill poly ] we give examples of polynomials with large coefficients that remain small for all small values of the arguments , that is , polynomials for which @xmath91 , for some rather short intervals @xmath70 compared with the length of @xmath69 .    in the above examples ,",
    "the ratios of the coefficients and @xmath2 are chosen to be very close to rational numbers with small numerators and denominators .",
    "alternatively , this can be written as the condition that the coefficients of @xmath96 satisfy @xmath112 for some small integers @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "below we present several results that demonstrate that this property indeed captures the class of exceptional polynomials @xmath96 with large values of @xmath97 adequately , at least in the qualitative sense .",
