    "the statistical theory of spectra @xcite provides an appropriate method for examining the symmetry properties of quantum systems .",
    "level statistics such as the nearest - neighbour spacing ( nns ) distribution and the spectral rigidity @xmath0 are defined for a pure sequence of levels that have same quantum numbers .",
    "usually , it is taken as granted that in a classically integrable system , which has as many integrals of motion ( or quantum numbers ) as the number of degrees of freedom , the levels are uncorrelated and so have a poissonian nns distribution .  the pure level sequence in a time - reversal - invariant quantum system whose classical counterpart is chaotic , is successfully represented by a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices .",
    "a deviation of level statistics from the predictions of the goe may be taken as an evidence that the sequence is not pure because of the existence of a hidden symmetry .",
    "the statistical theory of spectra has also been extensively used in the investigation of symmetry breaking because the destruction of a quantum number has a dramatic effect on the spectral fluctuations .",
    "impressive are the studies of isospin mixing in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "et al_.@xcite measured a ",
    "complete  spectrum of low - lying states of @xmath1al involving states with isospins @xmath2 and 1 throughout the energy range covered by the data .",
    "these data offered a testing ground for studying the influence of isospin - symmetry breaking on the fluctuation properties of energy spectra ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the limited data available in @xmath1al ( 142 levels ) precluded a definite conclusion .  in a recent experiment with monocrystalline quartz blocks , ellegaard _",
    "@xcite measured about 1400 well - resolved acoustic resonances .",
    "the properties of quartz allowed these authors to measure the gradual break - up of a point - group symmetry , which is statistically fully equivalent to the breaking of a quantum number like isospin .",
    "the spectra are obtained by externally tuning the symmetry breaking @xcite , allowing a statistically significant investigation of the whole transition .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the effect of gradual symmetry breaking on the fluctuation properties of energy levels .",
    "when the symmetry is full the spectrum is divided into independent sequences , each corresponding to one of the eigenvalues of the symmetry operator .",
    "we consider two possible scenarios for breaking the symmetry .",
    "the first is provided by the guhr - weidenmller model @xcite , which assumes that the perturbation acts equally on all states and that the matrix elements between states of different symmetry eigenvalues are random numbers of equal variances .  in the second scenario , the perturbation acts differently on the unperturbed states and the symmetry breaking interaction  mixes a limited number of the degenerate eigenstates that belong to different symmetry representations , and this number grows as we increase symmetry breaking .",
    "we are thus creating a new sequence of levels corresponding to states with no symmetry at the expense of the initial sequences .",
    "consequently , as the fractional density of the no - symmetry sequence increases , the @xmath0 statistics of the total spectrum first increases , moving in the direction of the prediction of the poisson statistics until the densities of all the sequences become equal , and then decreases to reach asymptotically the value given by the goe .",
    "section 3 shows that the behaviour described by the second scenario is indeed present in the data of ellegaard _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "the summary and conclusions of this work are given in sect .",
    "we consider a chaotic system that conserves a given symmetry .  in such a system ,",
    "the hamiltonian assumes a block - diagonal form @xcite : @xmath3  where each sub - block corresponds to states of certain quantum numbers .",
    "thus , when the symmetry is conserved , the levels are divided into a number of  pure  sequences , each described by a pure goe .  however , the statistical properties of the total spectrum that combines these sequences are no longer of the goe type .  in the limit of infinite number of sequences combined ,",
    "the spectrum obeys the poisson statistics .  for a finite number of sequences , the fluctuation properties are intermediate between the poisson and goe statistics .  in the following",
    ", we shall restrict our consideration to the case when the symmetry under investigation is represented by an operator that has two possible eigenvalues , such as parity , or isospin 0 and 1 as considered in refs @xcite .",
    "the nns distribution of a spectrum resulting from a random superposition of @xmath4 independent sequences is calculated , e.g. , by berry and robnik @xcite and in mehta s book @xcite .",
    "if the level density of the @xmath5th sequence is @xmath6 , and if the nns distribution of levels of this sequence is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the nns normalised to a unit mean , then the nns distribution of the mixed sequence is given by @xmath11 ^{2}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\sum_{i}\\left [ f_{i}\\frac{1-w_{i}(f_{i}s)}{e_{i}(f_{i}s)}\\right ] ^{2}\\right\\ } , \\label{mixedseq}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 @xmath13 dx$ ] , and @xmath14  in particular , if all the @xmath4 individual sequences have the same level densities , so that @xmath15 , and if the nns distribution in each is a wigner distribution @xmath16 which is a good approximation for the nns distribution of a goe , then ( 2 ) becomes @xcite @xmath17 ^{n}q_{n}(s)\\left [ \\frac{\\pi } { 2n}s+(n-1)q_{n}(s)\\right ] , \\label{nwigner}\\ ] ] where @xmath18erfc@xmath19 and erfc@xmath20 is the complementary error function .",
    "this distribution has a shape intermediate between those of the wigner and the poisson distributions .",
    "the brody distribution @xcite , @xmath21 accurately reproduces the spectra of many two - dimensional systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics . as we vary the parameter @xmath22 from 0 to 1 the statistics changes from poissonian to goe .",
    "the nns distribution contains information about the spectrum in a short range , not exceeding a maximum of three mean level spacings .",

    "the monotonous nature of the curves clearly shows that the transition from symmetry to no - symmetry in the guhr - weidenmller model is gradual and one - directional .",
    "the opposite extreme of the guhr - weidenmller model is the case when the eigenfunctions will become either very weakly or very strongly perturbed . for those states in which the perturbation is weak enough , the wave function can in principle be characterised by one of the two symmetry eigenvalues",
    ". these will be the states for which the splitting of two degenerate levels belonging to the two symmetry representations can be neglected .",
    "the corresponding energy levels will again form two independent sequences with fractional level densities @xmath56 while the levels of the strongly perturbed eigenstates will form a new sequence with density @xmath57 which will grow at the expense of the other two as the symmetry - breaking perturbation increases .",

    "the distribution will look more regular when we decrease @xmath61 until the level densities of the three sequences become equal .",

    "in this section , we show that the proposed application of the berry - robnik theory to symmetry breaking leads to a satisfactory description of the acoustic resonance spectra of monocrystalline quartz blocks , measured byellegaard et al .",
    "crystalline quartz exhibits @xmath67 point - group symmetry about the crystal s @xmath68 ( optical ) axis , and three two - fold rotation symmetries about the three @xmath69 ( piezoelectric ) axes ; the latter three axes lie in a plane orthogonal to the @xmath68 axis and sustain angles of 120 degrees with respect to each other .",
    "ellegaard et al . used rectangular blocks of dimensions @xmath70 mm@xmath71 cut in such a way that all symmetries are fully broken except a two - fold  flip  symmetry about one of the three @xmath69 axes .",
    "a gradual breaking of this symmetry is then achieved by removing successively bigger octants of a sphere from one corner , thereby creating a three - dimensional sinai billiard .",
    "the acoustic spectrum is measured for 8 radii of the removed octant , providing data of high statistical significance for the study of the gradual breaking of a point - group symmetry .",

    "the straight line labelled p is for an integrable system .",
    "we note that data for the case of tiny symmetry violation are systematically higher than the ones for the case of conserved symmetry .",
    "this agrees with the prediction of the second scenario proposed above , in which the system that undergoes a gradual symmetry breaking looks as if it has become more regular in the early stages of the transition .",
    "et al_. @xcite concluded from the rise of @xmath0 over the theoretical prediction for a superposition of two goe sequences that the quartz block with conserved flip symmetry has much in common with a pseudo - integrable system .",

    "pseudo - integrable ( pi ) systems are non - integrable systems , yet non - chaotic .",
    "two - dimensional pi systems , exemplified by particles moving in a planar polygonal enclosure with rational angles @xcite , share with the integrable system that the motion of trajectories in the phase space is restricted to two - dimensional compact surfaces .",
    "but these invariant surfaces are multi - connected and not tori as in the case of integrable systems .",
    "numerical studies of the @xmath73 rhombus billiard @xcite show that the spectral fluctuation properties are intermediate between those of a poisson ensemble and a goe .",
    "bogomolny _ et al_. @xcite studied the level statistics of pi systems using a modified version of dyson s stochastic coulomb gas model @xcite , in which the interaction between particles is restricted only to the nearest neighbours .  the nns distribution obtained in  @xcite is given by @xmath74 this distribution is in agreement with the numerical calculation for the rational billiards @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the formula obtained by these authors for the two - point correlation function @xmath75 leads to an expression for the @xmath0 statistics that asymptotically increases as @xmath76 , which is not consistent with the results of the numerical experiments .",
    "following several authors , e.g. @xcite , we shall represent the @xmath0 statistics by seligman - verbaarschot @xcite formula ( [ delta3sv ] ) ,  obtained for a superposition of poisson and goe level sequences , @xmath77 , \\label{delta3pi}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is a fitting parameter .  biswas and",

    "the only disagreement is between the calculated and measured values of @xmath44 at small values of @xmath10 as we have already expected .",
    "the symmetry breaking decreases the probability of finding degenerate levels sharply leading to the observed dip at small @xmath10 in the spacing distributions @xcite .",
    "this dip is followed by an overshoot to restore normalisation .",
    "the width of this dip , which is about 1/10 of the mean level spacing , provides an estimate for the minimum level - splitting below which two levels can be regarded as approximately degenerate .",
    "conventional models for symmetry breaking in chaotic systems assume that the non - diagonal matrix elements of the symmetry breaking perturbation are statistically equivalent .",

    "we propose another scenario for symmetry breaking in which the levels are approximately separated into two groups , one with and one without symmetry .",
    "this happens when the expansion of any of the wavefunctions in terms of the eigenfunctions of the symmetry operator is either dominated by a single term or composed of statistically equivalent contributions from all its component .",
    "considering a system in which a symmetry that has two representations is conserved , we represent the spectrum as a superposition of two independent sequences , one for each symmetry representation .",
    "now , as we switch on the symmetry breaking perturbation , we remove a number of levels from these two level sequences into a third sequence .",
    "the latter corresponds to the strongly perturbed states in which the symmetry has virtually disappeared .  because we have increased the number of spectral partitions , the spectrum will look as if it became more regular by the small violation of the symmetry .",
