    "photonic quantum memories @xcite are essential elements for quantum information networks @xcite , providing efficient and on - demand interfacing between single photons and stationary qubits , e.g. atomic gases @xcite , electronic spins in diamonds @xcite or phonons @xcite . besides featuring efficiencies and storage times which compare or even overcome those of atomic gases @xcite , solid state photonic memories based on rare earth doped crystals are becoming increasingly important as they offer prospects for scalability and integrability @xcite .",
    "most protocols for long distance quantum communication require quantum memories connected to communication channels through fibers . one possible direction to achieve this goal is to use telecom quantum memories , e.g. based on erbium doped solids @xcite or optomechanical systems @xcite . however , the most efficient and long lived storage systems up to date are working at wavelengths far from the telecom window , leading to large loss in optical fibres .",
    "possible solutions to overcome this problem include quantum frequency conversion @xcite or non - degenerate photon pair sources to establish entanglement between quantum memories and telecom photons @xcite .",
    "the latter approach has been demonstrated using the atomic frequency comb scheme @xcite in rare earth doped single crystals or waveguides @xcite , but the storage of photonic entanglement was performed so far only in the excited state for short and pre - determined storage times .",
    "longer and programmable storage times can be obtained by transferring the optical atomic excitations to long lived spin collective excitations ( spin waves ) thanks to control laser pulses @xcite .",
    "recently , spin wave storage of weak coherent states at the single photon level @xcite , including qubit storage @xcite , has been demonstrated with rare - earth doped crystals .",
    "the generation and storage of continuous variable entanglement between a multimode solid - state quantum memory and a light field have also been reported recently @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "light - matter entanglement is created within the memory between spontaneously emitted light and spin waves , the matter part then being converted into a light field .",
    "this is a read - only quantum memory @xcite with the generated light fields being resonant and , for this demonstration , outside the telecommunication band .",
    "this motivates the need for a write - read quantum memory that can store an externally prepared quantum optical state that shares a quantum correlation with a telecom band photon . to date",
    ", this has not been achieved with an on - demand spin - wave solid - state quantum memory .",
    "its successful realization with single photons requires an efficient quantum light source matching the spectral properties of the quantum memory @xcite , and the quasi - suppression of the noise generated by the strong control pulses .",
    "these tasks are challenging due to the small spectral separation between the hyperfine states of the optically active ions ( a few mhz in our system ) .        here",
    ", we demonstrate the spin - wave ( sw ) storage with on - demand retrieval of heralded single photons in a pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystal using the full atomic frequency comb ( afc ) scheme .",
    "this is achieved by generating pairs of non - degenerate single photons where one photon is resonant with the optical transition of pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 while the other photon is at telecom wavelength .",
    "the telecom photon is used to herald the presence of the other photon , which is stored as a sw in the crystal and retrieved on demand after a controllable time .",
    "we measure second order cross correlation values between the heralding and the retrieved photons which exceed the classical bound fixed by the cauchy - schwarz inequality for storage times longer than @xmath3 , effectively demonstrating quantum correlations between telecom photons and single spin waves in a solid .",

    "the narrow - band spectral filtering of the noise resulting from the control pulses is accomplished with a second pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystal , where a narrow transparency window ( around @xmath7 ) is burnt at the frequency of the afc @xcite .",

    "the probability to obtain a single signal photon in front of the quantum memory conditioned on a detection in the idler spd ( i.e. the heralding efficiency ) is @xmath12 .",

    "this result represents an improvement in terms of @xmath39 by more than one order of magnitude compared to the state of the art in the same system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 value increases after the afc storage due to the fact that the stored photons are transferred to a temporal mode free of noise @xcite .",
    "after the retrieval , we measure @xmath41 , larger than the value measured before storage .",

    "we then perform spin wave storage experiments by sending pairs of strong control pulses after the detection of each heralding photon . the first control pulse with wave vector @xmath44 transfers the collective optical excitation @xmath45 into a collective spin excitation ( a spin wave ) , which can be written as @xmath46 for a storage time in the ground state of @xmath47 ( thus a total storage time @xmath48 ) , we detect the retrieved photons , i.e. the spin - wave echo ( @xmath49 ) , with an efficiency @xmath50 .",

    "the measured noise floor ( @xmath64 photons per storage trial ) is lower than with the conditional one ( section [ sws ] ) .",
    "we attribute this result to the fact that the number of control pulse pairs per comb is larger in the unconditional sequence .",

    "if a larger integration window is considered , @xmath71 , the @xmath72 value is reduced to @xmath73 due to a bigger contribution of noise in the @xmath53 . on the other hand , due to a reduction of the statistical error",

    "the main advantage of the full afc protocol is the possibility to store multiple distinguishable temporal modes , while maintaining their coherence and quantum correlation @xcite .",
    "this ability is crucial for applications in quantum information protocols , e.g. to enable temporally multiplexed quantum repeater protocols with high communication speed @xcite and storage of time - bin qubits robust against decoherence in optical fibers . to test this aspect , we perform experiments with detection gates much longer than the photons duration .",

    "we measure non - classical correlations between the idler and the retrieved signal photons up to a total storage time @xmath89 . note that , while we measure the cauchy - schwarz parameter @xmath72 for @xmath90 , to assess the non - classicality for longer storage times we make the assumption that the retrieved signal autocorrelation does not change with the storage time .",

    "the demonstrated quantum correlation between a telecom photon and a spin wave in a solid is an essential resource to generate entanglement between remote solid state quantum memories @xcite . the measured value of @xmath53 after spin wave storage is currently limited by the signal - to - noise ratio of the retrieved photon , which is in turn mostly limited by the low storage and retrieval efficiency .",
