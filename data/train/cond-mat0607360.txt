    "in 1958 , huffaker @xcite , in a pioneering experiment , has been able to maintain in the laboratory a population of prey and predators coexisting and presenting self - sustained coupled time oscillations .",
    "he has verified that persistence of species was only possible in a large and heterogeneous space . since then",
    "different models have been proposed to explain the rle of space in determining the species coexistence @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these models is that they are based either on interacting particle systems @xcite , also called stochastic lattice models @xcite , or on probabilistic cellular automata .",
    "these descriptions are appropriate and relevant when considering predator - prey systems which are under conditions of very low species population densities and/or when their habitat is spatially heterogeneous @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we study a stochastic model that takes into account the spatial structure explicitly to describe two population biology issues : the threshold of species coexistence in a predator - prey system and the spreading of an infectious disease in a population .",
    "the individuals of each population are treated as discrete and they are supposed to occupy the sites of a two - dimensional lattice . the interactions between individuals are included in the local stochastic rules which take into account the lotka - volterra mechanisms of interaction @xcite .",
    "the dynamics associated to the system is a markovian discrete time process defined by a probabilistic cellular automaton , having three states per site , which we call predator - prey cellular automaton .",
    "the connection between pattern formation and species coexistence in this model was recently analyzed @xcite .",
    "results from steady - state simulations have shown that , depending on the set of the parameters of the model , the following steady states can be attained @xcite : a prey absorbing state , where predators have been extinct and the lattice is full of prey , and an active state where both species coexist with constant time densities . for finite systems , it was also detected an active state where both population densities oscillate in time with the same characteristic frequency @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to determine with precision the threshold of stable coexistence of species in the predator - prey cellular automaton . to this end",
    "we perform time - dependent simulations @xcite which allow us to obtain the phase boundaries together with the critical exponents .",
    "the scaling analysis of the time - dependent simulations yields a set of dynamic critical exponents and thus the possibility of classification of the models with absorbing states in universality classes . here",
    ", we have found that the automaton exhibits a line of continuous phase transition which belongs to the universality class of directed percolation , for all sets of parameters such that the prey birth probability is different from zero .",
    "when this probability vanishes there occurs a crossover to the universality class of dynamic isotropic percolation . in this limit",
    "the predator - prey cellular automaton is mapped into a model for the spreading of an epidemic with immunization , a general epidemic process @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the predator - prey cellular automaton and the time - dependent simulations .",
    "critical properties and pictures of growing clusters generated by the simulations are shown in the same section . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the critical behavior of a model for an epidemic spreading .",
    "we briefly discuss and summarize our results in sec .",
    "we assume that each individual of each species population can reside on the sites of a regular square lattice which represents their habitat .",
    "a site in the lattice can be in one of three states : occupied by a prey individual ( @xmath0 ) ; occupied by a predator individual ( @xmath1 ) or empty ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the predator - prey probabilistic cellular automaton comprehends the following processes : @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 the transitions between states obey probabilistic rules which depend on the state of the given site and on the states of its four nearest neighbors at the north , east , south and west ( which defines the neighborhood ) .",
    "the update is synchronous and the rules are :    \\(i ) a prey individual can be born in an empty site with a probability @xmath6 times the number of sites occupied by prey in the neighborhood , process ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) a predator individual can be born in a site occupied by a prey if there are predators in its neighborhood .",
    "prey disappear instantaneously and give place to a new predator .",
    "the probability of this process is @xmath7 times the number of sites occupied by predators in the neighborhood , process ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the death of predators is spontaneous : a site occupied by a predator can be evacuated with a probability @xmath8 .",
    "this process reintegrates to the system the resources for prey proliferation , process ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the model has three parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , we assume that @xmath14 , thus just two parameters are independent .",
    "we consider the parametrization @xcite : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is such that @xmath18 and parameter @xmath8 denotes the death probability of predators , @xmath13 .",
    "this parametrization allows us to analyze the model in a triangular phase diagram @xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] .",
    "the system evolves in time and can eventually reach stationary states characterized by constant time densities of prey , predators , and empty sites .",
    "these can be either active states where prey and predators have stable coexistence or absorbing states .",
    "we note that finite systems also exhibit local oscillatory behavior of the densities of prey and predators @xcite . a transition line @xmath20 crosses the entire @xmath19 diagram represented in fig .",
    "it starts from the left corner of the triangle and ends on the opposite side .",
    "the densities of prey , predators and empty sites change continuously at @xmath20 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the transition is from the active state to the prey absorbing state and the transition line was estimated firstly in reference @xcite . in the limiting case corresponding to @xmath22 , the point where @xmath20 meets the right side of triangle of fig .",
    "[ diag ] , the transition is from one of the infinitely many absorbing states to the prey absorbing state . in order to determine the critical line @xmath20 , with precision , and the dynamic critical exponents , we perform time - dependent simulations .      to carry out a time - dependent simulation analysis for the predator - prey cellular automaton we follow the time evolution of states very close to the prey absorbing state .",
    "we depart from an initial condition ( @xmath23 ) with a single predator at the origin of a lattice covered by prey .",
    "once the system is placed in the initial condition we apply the local rules ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , described in sec .",
    "ii a , and let it evolves in time .",
    "we have considered @xmath24 samples ( independent runs ) all starting with this same condition . for each fixed value of @xmath17",
    "we vary @xmath8 near its transition value .",
    "the simulations were performed in systems sufficiently large so that predators do not reach the borders of the lattice .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the following quantities : the survival probability of predators @xmath25 , that is , the probability that predators have not been extinct until time @xmath26 ; the mean - number of predators @xmath27 at time @xmath26 , whose average is calculated over all the samples , including those where predators have been extinct before time @xmath26 ; and the average mean - square distance of spreading of predators from the origin , @xmath28 .",
    "this average is calculated by taking into account only the samples that survived until time @xmath26 .    according to the scaling laws for time - dependent simulations @xcite , for large values of @xmath26",
    ", we expect , at the critical point , the following power laws , @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the critical exponents associated to the mean - number of predators , the survival probability , and the mean - square distance of spreading , respectively .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ exponents ] , the log - log plot of the mean - number of predators , as well as of the survival probability , show very well defined critical and off - critical asymptotic behaviors . for a fixed value of @xmath35 and values of @xmath8 below , but close to the critical value ( supercritical regime ) , these quantities present a positive curvature , which indicates the presence of activity in the system ; and for values of @xmath8 greater than the critical value ( subcritical regime ) they present a negative curvature . at criticality ,",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath25 exhibit a very clear asymptotic power law behavior .",
    "therefore , it is possible to obtain , with precision , the phase boundaries together with the critical exponents . from fig .",
    "[ exponents ] we get the following estimates for the critical exponents @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( that is , for @xmath39 ) . as reported in table i , the same values for the exponents , with the error bars , were obtained ( using the same procedure ) for different values of @xmath17 along the critical line @xmath20 ( excluding the critical point for which @xmath22 ) . the errors of the exponents were estimated by dividing @xmath24 samples in bins of @xmath40 runs , and calculating the fluctuation of the averages obtained for each bin .",

    "the critical behavior of this model has been extensively studied and it belongs to the directed percolation class @xcite .",
    "other examples are the domany - kinzel cellular automaton @xcite and the spreading of damage transitions @xcite . among the models with more then one absorbing state ,",
    "perhaps the most known is the ziff - gullari - barshad model @xcite for the reaction of oxidation of carbon monoxide over a catalytic surface ; it also has dynamic critical exponents @xcite consistent with the ones associated to the directed percolation class",
    ".    the critical exponent associated to the time correlation length @xmath47 can be obtained from the time - dependent simulations . here , the estimation was accomplished by studying the time behavior of the derivative @xmath48 of the mean - value of predators @xmath36 . from the scaling laws",
    "it can be shown that @xcite , @xmath49 at the critical value of @xmath8 .",

    "consequently , just a few number of empty sites are present in the steady state and also in the growing clusters .",
    "this behavior suggests that the present three state process , in the limit @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath59 finite , can be replaced by a two state process , similar to the contact process , involving predators and prey , as pointed out in reference @xcite .    the growing cluster of the upper panel of fig .",

    "we remark that these critical clusters are still related to transitions belonging to the directed percolation class .",
    "a qualitative similar behavior of critical clusters was obtained by dammer and hinrichsen @xcite for an epidemic spreading model which also presents a crossover from the directed percolation critical behavior to the dynamic percolation critical behavior .",
    "for @xmath22  the predator - prey probabilistic cellular automaton can be interpreted as a model for the propagation of an epidemic with immunization .",
