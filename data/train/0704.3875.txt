    "the method of controlled lagrangians for stabilization of relative equilibria ( steady state motions ) originated in bloch , leonard , and marsden @xcite and was then developed in auckly  @xcite , bloch , leonard , and marsden @xcite , bloch , chang , leonard , and marsden @xcite , and hamberg  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach for hamiltonian controlled systems was introduced and further studied in the work of blankenstein , ortega , van der schaft , maschke , spong , and their collaborators ( see , e.g. , @xcite and related references ) .",
    "the two methods were shown to be equivalent in @xcite and a nonholonomic version was developed in @xcite , and @xcite .    in the controlled lagrangian approach ,",
    "one considers a mechanical system with an uncontrolled ( free ) lagrangian equal to kinetic energy minus potential energy . to start with",
    ", one considers the case in which the lagrangian is invariant with respect to the action of a lie group @xmath0 on the configuration space . to stabilize a relative equilibrium of interest",
    ", the kinetic energy is modified to produce a _ controlled lagrangian _ which describes the dynamics of the controlled closed - loop system .",
    "the equations corresponding to this controlled lagrangian are the closed - loop equations and the new terms appearing in those equations corresponding to the directly controlled variables correspond to control inputs .",
    "the modifications to the lagrangian are chosen so that no new terms appear in the equations corresponding to the variables that are not directly controlled .",
    "this process of obtaining controlled euler  lagrange equations by modifying the original lagrangian is referred to as _",
    "kinetic matching_.    one advantage of this approach is that once the form of the control law is derived using the controlled lagrangian , the stability of a relative equilibrium of the closed - loop system can be determined by energy methods , using any available freedom in the choice of the parameters of the controlled lagrangian . to obtain asymptotic stabilization , dissipation - emulating terms",
    "are added to the control input .",
    "the method is extended in @xcite to the class of lagrangian mechanical systems with potential energy that may break symmetry , _ i.e. _ , there is still a symmetry group @xmath0 for the kinetic energy of the system but one may now have a potential energy that need not be @xmath0-invariant .",
    "further , in order to define the controlled lagrangian , a modification to the potential energy is introduced that also breaks symmetry in the group variables . after adding the dissipation - emulating terms to the control input",
    ", this procedure allows one to achieve complete state - space asymptotic stabilization of an equilibrium of interest .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to develop the method of controlled lagrangians for discrete mechanical systems .",
    "the discretization is done in the spirit of discrete variational mechanics , as in @xcite . in particular , as the closed loop dynamics of a controlled lagrangian system is itself lagrangian , it is natural to adopt a variational discretization that exhibits good long - time numerical stability .",
    "this study is also motivated by the recent development of structure - preserving algorithms for the numerical simulation of discrete controlled systems , such as recent work on discrete optimization , such as in @xcite .",
    "the matching procedure is carried out explicitly for discrete systems with one shape and one group degree of freedom to avoid technical issues and to concentrate on the new phenomena that emerge in the discrete setting that have not been observed in the continuous - time theory . in particular",
    ", it leads one to either carefully select the momentum levels or introduce a new term in the controlled lagrangian to perform the discrete kinetic matching .",
    "further , when the potential shaping is carried out , it is necessary to introduce non - conservative forcing in the shape equation associated with the controlled lagrangian .",
    "it is also shown that once energetically stabilized , the ( relative ) equilibria of interest can be asymptotically stabilized by adding dissipation emulating terms .",
    "the separation of controlled dissipation from physical dissipation remains an interesting topic for future research ; even in the continuous theory there are interesting questions remaining , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis is validated by simulating the discrete cart - pendulum system on an incline . when dissipation is added , the inverted pendulum configuration is seen to be asymptotically stabilized , as predicted .",
    "the discrete controlled dynamics is used to construct a real - time model predictive controller with piecewise constant control inputs .",
    "this serves to illustrate how discrete mechanics can be naturally applied to yield digital controllers for mechanical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ discrete_mech.sec ] and [ matching.sec ] we review discrete mechanics and the method of controlled lagrangians for stabilization of equilibria of mechanical systems . the discrete version of the potential shaping procedure and related stability analysis are discussed in section  [ discrete_matching.sec ] .",
    "the theory is illustrated with the discrete cart - pendulum system in section [ disc_cart_pendulum.sec ] .",
    "simulations and the construction of the digital controller are presented in sections [ simulations.sec ] and [ digital.sec ] .    in a future publication",
    "we intend to treat discrete systems with nonabelian symmetries as well as systems with nonholonomic constraints .",
    "a discrete analogue of lagrangian mechanics can be obtained by considering a discretization of hamilton s principle ; this approach underlies the construction of variational integrators . see marsden and west  @xcite , and",
