    "strong and ultra - strong qubit - cavity interactions have been achieved in both cavity qed and circuit qed systems ( see , e.g. , phys - today , nature-458 - 178,nature-2 - 81,add1 ) .",
    "this opens up many new possible applications .",
    "for example , one could use the cavity as a quantum bus to couple widely - separated qubits in a quantum computer @xcite , as a quantum memory to store quantum information , or as a generator and detector of single microwave photons for quantum communications @xcite .    as a demonstration of strong interaction in cavity qed and circuit qed systems , the vacuum rabi splitting has been an exciting subfield of optics and solid - state physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , after its observation in atomic systems @xcite . in 2004 , two groups @xcite  reported the experimental realization of vacuum rabi splitting  in semiconductor systems : a single quantum dot in a spacer of photonic crystal nanocavity and in semiconductor microcavity , respectively . in the same year , the experiment nature-431 - 162 showed that the vacuum rabi splitting can also been obtained in a superconducting two - level system , playing the role of an artificial atom , coupled to an on - chip cavity consisting of a superconducting transmission line resonator . when the qubit was resonantly coupled to the cavity mode ,",
    "it was observed @xcite that two well - resolved spectral lines were separated by a vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 except for the asymmetry in the height of the two split energy - peaks ( e.g. , ref .  [ ] ) , the data is in agreement with the transmission spectrum numerically calculated using the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . when considering the vacuum rabi splitting behavior for strong qubit - cavity coupling , the anti - rotating terms should be taken into account , and this might explain the observed _ asymmetric _ spontaneous emission ( se ) spectrum .",
    "it is obvious that the anti - rotating terms are not important when the coupling between a qubit and the cavity field is sufficiently weak , and when the energy spacing of the qubit is resonant with the central frequency of the cavity .",
    "however , in the _ ultra - strong coupling _ regime , the anti - rotating terms of the intrinsic bath of the qubit coupling play an important role @xcite . as a consequence of the anti - rotating terms in the hamiltonian of cavity qed and circuit qed ,",
    "even the ground state of the system contains a finite number of virtual photons .",
    "theoretical research @xcite reveal that these virtual photons can be released by a non - adiabatic manipulation , where the rabi frequency @xmath1 is modulated in time at frequencies comparable or higher than the qubit transition frequency .",
    "this phenomenon , called emission of the quantum vacuum radiation , would be completely absent if these anti - rotating terms are neglected .",
    "the energy shift of the qubit in its intrinsic bath has been studied in @xcite using the full description , ( i.e. , non - markov and without rwa ) and found that the deviations from the previous approximation result already amount to @xmath2 for @xmath3    in doped semiconductor quantum wells embedded in a microcavity ( e.g. , pra-74 - 033811 ) , considering the anti - rotating coupling of the intracavity photonic mode and the electronic polarization mode , but using rwa in the coupling to their respective environments , it was found @xcite that for a coherent photonic input , signatures of the ultra - strong coupling have been identified in the asymmetric and peculiar anticrossing of the polaritonic eigenmodes . from the descriptions given above",
    ", it can be seen that , as @xmath4 increases to the ultra - strong coupling case , the anti - rotating terms that are otherwise negligible become more relevant and will lead to a profound modification in the nature of the quantum state of the qubit system .      in this paper , we study the se spectrum of a qubit in a cavity .",
    "our calculations include _ two kinds of anti - rotating terms _ : one from the intrinsic qubit environment and the other one from the cavity environment .",
    "this method is a powerful tool to investigate various kinds of qubit - environment interaction with anti - rotating terms and without using the markov approximation .",
    "because in this method , the qubit - environment coupling terms higher than the two - order are droped , it constricts that this method is unavailable in the case when the qubit - environment coupling strength is larger than the energy spacing of the qubit @xcite . comparing the cases of a qubit in an ohmic bath with the case of a qubit in a low - frequency bath",
    ", we find that for the case of a qubit in a low - frequency bath , as the qubit - cavity coupling strength increases , the height asymmetry of two splitting peaks is enhanced .",
    "however , for the case of a qubit in an ohmic bath , the height asymmetry of the spectral peaks are inverted from the same case of the low - frequency bath , when the qubit is strongly coupled to the cavity .",
    "increasing the qubit - cavity coupling to ultra - strong regime , the height asymmetry of the left and right peaks are inverted , which is consistent with the same case of low - frequency bath , only relatively weak . since experiments reported that _ a superconducting qubit intrinsic bath is mainly due to low - frequency noise , our results are consistent with experimental data _ using a superconducting qubit in ref .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the se spectrum on the strength of the qubit - cavity coupling and the quality factor @xmath5 of the cavity in either an ohmic or in a low - frequency intrinsic qubit bath .",
    "furthermore , we distinguish the contributions to the asymmetry from each bath : the intrinsic qubit bath and the cavity bath , and clarify the reason for the different kinds of peaks asymmetry .",
    "all of these results directly indicate that in the strong coupling regime , the se spectrum is deeply influenced by the anti - rotating terms and the type of intrinsic noise experienced by the qubit .",
    "by using a cavity to confine the electromagnetic field , the strength of the qubit - cavity interaction can be increased by several orders of magnitude to the regime of strong or even ultra - strong coupling @xcite .",
    "the strong - coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics has been reached for natural atoms in optical cavities , superconducting qubits in circuit resonators ( i.e. , on - chip cavities ) , and quantum dots in photonic - crystal nanocavities .",
    "recently , the ultra - strong coupling regime has be achieved for a superconducting qubit in an on - chip cavity @xcite .",
    "although the coupling of the qubit to the cavity is much stronger than the coupling of the qubit to its intrinsic environment , the parameters in ref .",
    "[ ] show that both the decay rate of the cavity photon ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) and the qubit decoherence rate ( @xmath8 @xmath7 ) are comparable .",
    "therefore , we model the environment of the qubit in a cavity using two bosonic baths : one , called the intrinsic bath of the qubit and represented by operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is related to the relaxation of the qubit induced by its intrinsic environment ; and the other , denoted as cavity bath of qubit and represented by the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 involves the relaxation of the qubit caused by photons in the cavity .",
    "figure 1 schematically shows the model considered here . for the intrinsic qubit bath ,",
    "a broad frequency spectrum ( e.g. , either an ohmic or a low - frequency spectrum ) can be used to characterize it . for the cavity bath , because of the cavity leakage , it can be described by a lorentzian spectrum with a central frequency , i.e. , a single - mode cavity with its frequency broadened by the cavity leakage .     which is coupled to a cavity with loss rate @xmath13 by the qubit - cavity coupling strength @xmath14,width=302 ]",
    "the hamiltonian can be written ( throughout this paper , we choose @xmath15 ) @xcite as@xmath16where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , denote the intrinsic and cavity baths of the qubit , respectively .",

    "a qubit can experience different types of intrinsic baths .",
    "the most commonly - used bath is the photon or phonon bath , which can be described by an ohmic spectrum .",
    "however , for many solid - state qubits ( e.g. , superconducting qubits ) , the dominant dissipation can be due to two - level fluctuators , which behave like a low - frequency bath @xcite .",
