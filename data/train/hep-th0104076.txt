    "recent progress in theories over noncommutative spaces ( for a review see e.g. @xcite@xcite and references therein ) , is stimulated by their importance for the nonperturbative dynamics of string theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "the noncommutative models share some common features with their commutative counterparts , however , there is a striking dissimilarity between them in some other aspects .",
    "one particular feature of noncommutative field theories discovered recently and which attracted a considerable interest is that in noncommutative models there exists a kind of localised solutions nonexistent in the models on commutative spaces .",
    "although they are different from what is a _",
    "soliton _ in usual sense , these solutions are conventionally called `` noncommutative solitons '' . in actual work",
    "we consider a subclass of such configurations .",
    "as it appears that the `` noncommutative solitons '' in actual work even do not carry energy ( at rest ) more adequate would be the term of `` vacuum '' or `` lump '' solution , throughout this paper we will keep the last name for them .",
    "noncommutative lumps , in a scalar model with a potential having nontrivial local minima were first discovered in @xcite , in the limit of strong noncommutativity .",
    "these solutions were interpreted as condensed lower dimensional branes living on a noncommutative brane @xcite .",
    "they were further generalised to the case of a mild noncommutativity by allowing the presence of the nontrivial gauge field backgrounds @xcite@xcite .",
    "this solutions correspond to nontrivial gauge field fluxes @xcite@xcite .",
    "the particular property of lump solutions we are considering in the actual paper is that they are `` made '' purely of the gauge fields . however using the equivalence between different noncommutative yang",
    " mills  higgs models @xcite , these configurations can be mapped into noncommutative solitons in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite or others .",
    "the general multi - lump solutions look like sums of projectors to mutually orthogonal finite - dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space . if subspaces are not orthogonal the configuration fails to be a static solution and lumps start to interact .    an approach to describe interacting lumps were proposed in @xcite by using the substitution of the configuration of shifted lumps by a close one but being a static solution . in this approach",
    "the interaction of the lumps is described by the motion in the curved moduli space of static solutions .",
    "this approach , however , would be valid only provided that the motion is confined to the moduli space of the static solution which requires it to be stable .",
    "there are , however , indications that the noncommutative lumps are not stable dynamically @xcite which leads also to the instability of the motion around the moduli space .",
    "our approach is free of these drawbacks since we do not make any assumptions about the stability .",
    "as the analysis shows the dynamics of the system does not look as a stable one , moreover , it appears to be stochastic !",
    "the regular motion occurs only when the distance between lumps is exactly @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for some natural initial conditions the dynamics of noncommutative lumps is described by finite dimensional matrix model .",
    "the plan of the actual paper is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the reader to the noncommutative lumps in yang  mills ",
    "higgs model .",
    "after that we analyse the lump dynamics in both naive approach when we treat lumps as rigid particles and neglect the dynamics of the `` shapes '' of the lumps and in an exact approach when all possible deformations are taken into account .",
    "the comparison reveals unexpected features in the behaviour of the interacting lumps .",
    "we also give directions to generalise the description to the case of lumps with arbitrary polarisations .",

    "the operators of the heisenberg algebra @xmath4 can be represented through ordinary functions given by their weyl symbols .",

    "since there is one - to - one correspondence between operators and their weyl symbols we will not distinguish between them , i.e. keep the same character for both , unless in the danger of confusion .",

    "it is given by commutative matrices of finite ranks @xcite .",
    "although these lumps carry no energy ,  they are geometrically nontrivial vacua , we will call them noncommutative lumps due to their close relation to ones discussed in the literature @xcite@xcite .    up to a gauge transformation the @xmath46-lump solution is given by , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is @xmath49-th eigenvalue of the ( finite rank ) operator @xmath2 .",
    "due to the finiteness of the rank the weyl symbol of @xmath2 vanishes at infinity as quick as gaussian factor times a polynomial .",

    "@xmath59 which shifts the lump back to the centre , but produce a kinetic term for @xmath60 .",
    "thus a single noncommutative lump moves freely like a _ non - relativistic _ particle .",
    "it is also stable since its energy at rest is zero .    in what follows we are going to analyse the situation when there is a couple of lumps separated by a distance @xmath56",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , a single noncommutative lump can be always rotated to have the polarisation @xmath54 and orientation along @xmath61 . when there are just two lumps one can choose _ without loss of generality _ the configuration to involve nontrivially only two matrices e.g. @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "consider two lumps which are obtained from @xmath64 by shifts along the noncommutative plane by respectively @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "since the dynamics of the centre is free and can be decoupled by a time - dependent gauge transformation similar to , where @xmath67 is the coordinate of the centre .",
    "thus , the configuration we consider looks like ,    [ 2solit ] @xmath68    where we introduced the shorthand notations , @xmath69 the quotient @xmath26 can be absorbed by the rescaling of the coupling and the time , therefore we can put it generically to unity @xmath70 .    in what follows",
    "also @xmath61 @xmath71 will enter trivially in the equations , so in the remaining part of the paper for the simplicity of notations the index @xmath72 will run the range @xmath73 .",
    "if we were considering more than two noncommutative lumps we would have to keep more matrices .",
    "consider first a naive approach where we are dealing with rigid interacting lumps which means that we are neglecting the deformations in their shapes . in this case",
    "the only parameter which is dynamical is the separation distance @xmath56 .",
    "although , this approximation sounds reasonable , later we will consider the exact description which shows that this approach is not justified .",
    "however , we decided to keep this naive analysis for illustrative purposes .    to obtain the action describing the dynamics",
    "let us insert the ansatz into the classical action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the computation of derivatives and traces gives for the following @xmath56-dependence of the action , @xmath74=\\int { \\mathrm{d}}t\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\theta}|\\dot{u}|^2 - 2{\\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{|u|^2}{2\\theta } }    ( 1-{\\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{|u|^2}{2\\theta}})\\right),\\ ] ] where we restored the explicit @xmath75 dependence .",
    "the potential is depicted on the fig.[pot ] . according to it sufficiently close lumps",
    "attract while distant ones repel . at the critical distance @xmath76",
    "they will stay in unstable equilibrium .",
    "the above conclusions concerning the lump dynamics would be valid , however , only in the case when one can neglect the involvement of the lump shape in the dynamics . to evaluate the importance of the shape dynamics one should consider arbitrary deformations of the shape of lumps and separate them from the motion of the lump as a whole .    in the next subsection",
    "we analyse the dynamics from the point of view of exact field equations of motion .",
    "the lump configuration is taken to be the initial condition for the field equations .",
    "the result we obtain in the next section will invalidate the results of the actual naive approach , however , the critical distance @xmath77 will correspond to a special case .",
    "the exact description of the lump dynamics is given by the field equations of motion for @xmath61 , @xmath78=0\\ ] ] corresponding to the action ( [ action ] ) , supplied with initial conditions given by the lump background .",
    "since the equations are second order , in addition to this one has to consider the initial values for the time derivatives of @xmath61 .",
    "the simplest choice is when the configuration at @xmath79 is static .",
    "thus , the initial conditions we impose are as follows ,    [ ic_true_no_speed ] @xmath80    considering the lumps in the initial moment as being at rest , produces a considerable simplification to the equations of motion .",
    "indeed , the initial data imply that the operators @xmath61 are nonzero only on the two - dimensional subspace @xmath81 of the hilbert space which is the linear span of vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 . since , in virtue of equations of motion , the second time derivative is proportional to commutators of @xmath61 then it also vanishes outside the two - dimensional subspace @xmath81 .",
    "due to zero initial conditions for the first derivatives operators @xmath61 will remain all the time in the same two - dimensional subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "let us consider only those components of @xmath61 which are nonzero .",
    "this reduces the hilbert space operators to ones acting on the two - dimensional subspace @xmath81 of the hilbert space spanned by @xmath84 .",
    "let us introduce an orthonormal basis on @xmath81 .",

    "our problem is reformulated in terms of the @xmath90 matrix model with equations of motion superficially looking the same as ( [ em ] ) , @xmath91=0,\\ ] ] but now @xmath92 are finite dimensional @xmath93 matrices .",
    "the initial conditions in the basis are rewritten as follows ,    [ ic2x2 ] @xmath94    ( it is worthwhile to note that the description in terms of 2@xmath952 matrices is valid only for the situation where the lumps were initially at rest . beyond this the conditions @xmath96 is an additional specification and it says that also the shapes of the lumps are not changing at the initial moment .",
    "one may try , however relax the last condition and consider more general initial configurations including lumps with rising / decreasing height for @xmath97 .",
    "one can consider more general initial condition @xmath98 for which the same description in terms of 2@xmath952 matrices remains valid .",
    "solutions of this type for @xmath99 were considered in @xcite . )    similar equations as ones given by ( [ em2x2 ] ) although in a different context of the one - dimensional ordinary yang  mills model were under study for a long time and were initiated by @xcite@xcite . in the modern context of the application to the finite @xmath46 matrix model they appear in @xcite@xcite . the system described by such equations",
    "was shown to exhibit a stochastic behaviour .",
    "let us describe it in more details to the application to the present case .",
    "in order to rewrite the equations in the scalar form let us expand the matrices @xmath61 in terms of the two - dimensional pauli matrices @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and the two - dimensional unity matrix @xmath102 ( which in fact is the projector to @xmath81 ) satisfying , @xmath103=    { \\mathrm{i}}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\sigma_\\gamma,\\qquad [ \\sigma_\\alpha,{\\mathbb{i}}_2]=0,\\ ] ] the expansion is as follows , @xmath104    in terms of this expansion the equations of motion look as follows ,    [ pa_matr ] @xmath105 where @xmath106 . for the initial conditions one also has",

    "the remaining parts are subjects to more complicate nonlinear dynamics .    before analysing the solutions for @xmath111 , @xmath101",
    "let us consider their interpretation in terms of the lump dynamics over noncommutative space in the star - product representation .",
    "the noncommutative function which corresponds to a particular solution @xmath112 will be given by @xmath113 where @xmath112 are the solutions of to and @xmath114 with @xmath115 are the weyl symbols corresponding to the pauli matrices .",
    "the respective weyl symbols are computed in the appendix .",
    "they are given by ,    [ sigmas ] @xmath116    as it can be seen from the eqs .",
    ", irrelevant to the particular form of the solution @xmath117 , at any time fields @xmath118 are nonzero only in the small vicinities ( of the size of the order of @xmath119 ) of of points @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this means that irrespective to the initial distance between the lumps once left with zero initial velocities they will not try to leave their places , the dynamics instead will concern only their heights and creation of a `` baby - lump '' in the middle point between them .",
    "let us note that this should be surprising as it is in total disagreement with the naive approach drawn in the previous subsection , since there is no regime when the lumps would behave like rigid particles .",
    "let us consider now the the time - dependent functions @xmath122 in more details .",
    "the equations are too complicate to find the general solution , however , for our particular initial data one can use the rich symmetry of the model and find a simplifying ansatz .    assuming that the magnitudes of @xmath123 and @xmath124 are equal @xmath125 also for nonzero times",
    ", we can check this assumption later as a consistency condition for the ansatz , but also prove it independently of the ansatz using conservation laws , one can split @xmath123 and @xmath124 into two orthogonal components @xmath126 and @xmath127 as follows ,    [ ans_1 ] @xmath128    the equality of the square modules @xmath125 implies that @xmath129 and @xmath130 remain orthogonal .",

    "the initial conditions are respectively , @xmath134    from eqs .",
    "one can see that the directions of @xmath126 and @xmath127 do not change .",
    "the fact that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are always mutually orthogonal makes the assumption @xmath125 for the ansatz consistent .    splitting the vectors",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 in the dynamical magnitude and the static direction , given by the constant unimodular vectors    @xmath135    one has the equations for the magnitudes @xmath129 and @xmath130 ,    [ 2d ] @xmath136 which are supplied by the initial data , @xmath137    as we mentioned earlier , the system exhibits a stochastic behaviour which has been studied both numerically and analytically @xcite@xcite .",
    "the system is equivalent to one of a two - dimensional particle in the potential @xmath138 .",
    "the allowed by energy conservation region of the configuration space is divided into so called stadium @xmath139 where the motion is almost free and four channels along the axes .",
    "the motion in channels can be described by the asymptotic formula , in the limit when one coordinate is much smaller than another , say @xmath140 @xcite ,    [ asy ] @xmath141,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath144 being the time of entrance into the channel .    in the channel",
    "the particle reach the maximal value of @xmath145 after which it is reflected back to the stadium .",
    "the instability arises when the particle passes through the stadium and enters a new channel .",
    "so , generally the motion of the particle is stochastic .",
    "also there is a discrete set of trajectories which are closed .",
    "thus , depending on initial conditions the system can move in a regular periodic way , although this motion is unstable as arbitrary small perturbation can push the system to the stochastic regime .",
    "the asymptotic formulae , can provide a reliable description of the system for a certain period of time for extremal cases when the lump centre separation distance is either large ( @xmath146 ) or small ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) then for times less than @xmath150 , one has the asymptotic solution ,    @xmath151.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the opposite case when the lumps are close one can again give a reliable description for of the dynamics by the asymptotic formula ,    @xmath152,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    valid for times up to of order @xmath153 after which the system approaches the stadium where we can not control it .",
    "there is also one particular separation distance which corresponds to periodic motion .",
    "this happens for the initial conditions @xmath154 or @xmath155 . in this case",
    "the motion is periodic and is given by @xmath156 where for @xmath157 we have the ( implicit ) formula , @xmath158    now , let us recall that in terms of @xmath159 and @xmath160 the dynamical field @xmath161 describing the lumps takes according to eq . the following form ,    [ sol ] @xmath162 and , @xmath163    where the functions @xmath164 are given by the eqs . .",
    "let us note that the function @xmath165 is localised in the points where the lumps are i.e. at @xmath121 while the function @xmath166 is localised at both lump positions as well as at the origin where is the middle of the lump centres connecting line .",
    "the analysis of the solution reveals that once left at their positions the lumps will not tend to move away from them but engage in a stochastic change of their heights as well as creation of a `` baby '' lump in the middle point between them which is the origin of the noncommutative plane .",
    "this process can be reliably described for a while of time in the limits when the lumps are placed very close or very far , each case degenerating to stochastic , although correlated variation in the heights of the lumps .",
    "the difference arising when considering moving lumps consists in the initial values for the velocities .",
    "since a generic initial condition for the velocities can complicate the system making it back infinite dimensional we confine ourselves to such initial configurations which correspond to rigid motion of the lumps .",
    "thus , one has to replace the initial values for the velocities by the following , @xmath167 or , explicitly , using ,    [ speeds ] @xmath168    where @xmath169 , and solve the infinite dimensional operator equation .    applying the same strategy as in the case of lumps at rest",
    "we see that the initial data are given by operators which are nonzero only in a four - dimensional subspace @xmath170 of the infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 , which is spanned by our two old vectors @xmath84 together with other two newcomers @xmath171 .",
    "let us note that they are all linear independent for @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , the system is reduced to the four - dimensional matrix model .",
    "the treatment of this model differs from what we had with lumps at rest only in technical details , therefore we will not discuss it more .    the qualitative picture one has in this situation does not change much in comparison to the case of lumps a rest . just as in the previous case",
    "there is a stochastic dynamics of the heights of the lumps and creation of `` baby''-lumps while the centres of the lumps will keep moving with the constant velocities .",
    "indeed , for accelerating lump operators @xmath61 are nonzero out of the subspace @xmath170 , which , as we know , does not happen .",
    "in general , the solution is given by a linear combination with time dependent coefficients of functions , their first derivatives @xmath173 , @xmath174 and some of their second derivatives like @xmath175 .",
    "once we want to relate our system to the the yang  mills / bfss model we have to care about the gauss law constraint , which is obtained from the variation of the @xmath176 component of the original gauge invariant noncommutative yang ",
    "mills or bfss action .",
    "this constraint looks like follows , @xmath177=0.\\ ] ]    as we discussed at the beginning of this section the equations of motion imply that the quantity is at least conserved .",
    "indeed , using the equations of motion one has @xmath178=0.\\ ] ]    therefore to get a self - consistent solution for the yang  mills / m(atrix ) theory one has to verify that @xmath179 . for zero velocity initial conditions this",
    "is implied automatically , while for the moving lumps one has , @xmath180|_{t=0}={\\mathrm{i}}v\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{2}-    \\bar{a}\\right)x_1+\\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{2}+    \\bar{a}\\right)x_2\\right]+\\text{h.c.},\\ ] ] where `` h.c . ''",
    "stands for the hermitian conjugate .",
    "the equation requires velocities @xmath181 and @xmath182 to vanish .",
    "however , the violation of the gauss law for nonzero velocities may be interpreted as the presence of nontrivial electric charge . indeed , in the presence of external sources the gauss law becomes , @xmath183+\\rho=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is some electric charge density which appears in the action as a term @xmath185 and which is chosen to cancel exactly .",
    "( here we are not going to analyse in which conditions such charge density can be created . )    as a result we have that the gauss low is satisfied automatically in the case of the lumps at rest , while moving lumps generate some background charge distribution .",
    "one can do analogous analysis in more than @xmath186 dimensions .",
    "the only difference which appear in @xmath187 dimensions is that one has to compute the weyl symbols of sigma matrices with respect to a different background e.g. one given by . as a result one has equations similar to ,    [ sigmas - multi ] @xmath188    where we introduced the notation , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and squares are computed with the metric @xmath191 . in the basis",
    "for which the non - commutativity matrix @xmath192 takes the canonical form , @xmath193 the metric @xmath194 is diagonal , @xmath195 where @xmath196    then the solution is given by equation similar to but with @xmath197 and @xmath198 instead of respective two - dimensional symbols .",
    "in this paper we considered the dynamics of interacting noncommutative lumps .",
    "the naive approach for the dynamics is obtained when one considers the motion of the lumps as rigid structures and not their deformations .",
    "the action in this approach is given by initial classical action of the noncommutative model computed when all `` degrees of freedom '' except the positions of the lumps are frozen . in this approximation one obtains that the lump pair dynamics is described by a cup - shaped potential having minimum at the origin , gaussian decay at the infinity and an unstable equilibrium at the distance @xmath199 .",
    "the exact analysis of the interacting lump dynamics in the the framework of the original noncommutative theory , however , refute above approximation since it appears that in fact it is the shape which is affected by the dynamics , while the motion of the centres of the lumps is not .",
    "it is interesting to note that the problem formulated in noncommutative yang  mills model is reduced to one in finite dimensional matrix model .",
    "thus , in the case of two lumps starting at the rest the exact description reduces to a @xmath200 matrix model .",
    "in particular we have that the u(1 ) part of these model has trivial dynamics , while the remaining su(n ) parts generally exhibits stochastic behaviour .",
    "the property of this dynamics that it does not affect the motion along the line connecting the lumps appears to be anti - intuitive to what one could expect from interaction of ( quasi)particle objects .",
    "let us note that an analogous situation can be met in the analysis of the vortex interaction in the applications to solid state physics , @xcite , where a behaviour similar to one of noncommutative lumps was observed long ago .",
    "it seems that these results can be easily generalised to the case of lumps with arbitrary mutual hilbert space polarisations not related to the shifts along noncommutative space .",
    "the dynamics of such lumps or branes does not differ qualitatively from the case shifted ones , however , in this case we do not have simple physical picture we can observe .",
    "however , from the point of view of mathematical completeness this would be worthy to be considered , and probably will be done in future research .",
    "it seems that the interpretation in terms of branes when the heights of the lumps have the meaning of coordinates of the 0-brane in the direction transversal to the noncommutative brane is the most natural . in this context",
    "it appears that the dynamics of interacting branes affects only the motion in the transversal directions in which d0-branes are stochastically `` bouncing '' around the noncommutative brane .",
    "translating the above said about lumps to the branes , we have learnt that the dynamics of two interacting 0-branes is described by u(2 ) m(atrix ) model in the case when the branes do not move or do not change their polarisations .",
    "if the branes are affected by motion one needs a matrix model of higher dimension to describe it .",
    "so far we considered only the pair interaction of the lumps .",
    "it also would be of interest to extend the analysis of the actual paper to a greater number of the lumps , eventually to consider the gas of lumps .",
