    "the concept that astrophyscal shock waves are efficient accelerators of cosmic rays have widely been accepted for a long time @xcite . due to the supernova energetics and rates",
    ", it seems reasonable that most of galactic cosmic rays up to 10@xmath4 ev originate from supernova remnants ( snrs ) shocks accelerating particles ( protons and electrons ) in the interstellar ( ism ) and circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "an efficiency of order 10@xmath5 of the mechanical energy in the shocks must go into accelerating protons and nuclei to explain the observed intensity of cosmic rays .",
    "however , the relative efficiency of acceleration of protons vs. electrons as well as the maximum energies obtained are not well understood , but are all fundamental to the study of cosmic rays and their effects on the ism .",
    "recently x - ray and @xmath3-ray observations to snrs , e.g. sn1006 , rx j1713.7 - 3946 and vela junior ( rx j0852.0 - 4622 etc ) have revealed that snr shocks are able to accelerate particles to tev energies @xcite .",
    "the high energy particles responsible for emitting tev photons can be either hadrons or leptons , which are produced in astrophysical accelerators as in snrs .",
    "two primary tev photon emission processes are the decay of neutral pions produced by interactions of hadronic particles ( mostly protons ) with ambient matter and the inverse - compton scattering of electrons on ambient photons ( mostly the micro - wave background radiation in the typical ism ) .",
    "the particles , which undergo such energy losses , do not escape the acceleration and emission sites due to the presence of magnetic fields",
    ". however , the tev photons escape directly , allowing us to explore the sites of these processes .    the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) , with its excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution in the standard of @xmath3-ray astronomy , greatly stimulates studies of very high energy astrophysics in recent years .",
    "a multi - wavelength approach has proven to be robust in shedding light on the nature of tev sources . among well - identified radio / x - ray counterparts of about 30 galactic tev sources , young shell - type snrs and pulsar wind nebulae",
    "are thought to be two major @xmath3-ray generators @xcite .",
    "other candidates have also been proposed as counterparts of some unidentified tev sources , e.g. , old snrs @xcite , hypernova and @xmath3-ray burst remnants @xcite , giant molecular clouds @xcite , and young stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "recently , the extended tev source hess j1731 - 347 is found to almost entirely overlap an old radio / x - ray snr candidate g353.6 - 0.7 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t08 ) .",
    "the association between hess j1731 - 347 and g353.6 - 0.7 , as suggested by t08 , makes this system a favorable laboratory for studying the generation of @xmath3-rays in evolved snrs .",
    "t08 considered the case of hadronic particle acceleration in an snr shock encountering a dense molecular cloud , based on the theoretical model @xcite , but conclusion remained to be drawn due to limitation of the data explored in their paper , i.e. , low counting statistics of the _ rosat _ observation and the lack of high - resolution @xmath6co maps . in this paper , we report new results obtained from _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ x - ray observations and co spectral - line data from delinha 13.7 m radio telescope , and examine the theoretical model .",
    "hess j1731 - 347 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ on march 21 , 2007 ( obsid 0405680201 ; pi : g. puehlhofer ) , with a 25 ksec exposure .",
    "we reduced the data obtained from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) , version 8.0 .",
    "we selected epic - mos and epic - pn events with pattens 0 - 12 and 0 - 4 , respectively .",
    "an examination of the light curve indicated that the observation was contaminated by background flares .",
    "cleaning of the high particle background results in effective exposure of 15.9 , 11.8 and 6.2 ks for the mos1 , mos2 and pn detectors , respectively .",
    "moreover , the observation was also contaminated by straylight , presumably from a bright source , 1rxs j173157.7 - 335007 @xcite , located at @xmath050@xmath7 off axis to the north and outside the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "consequently , a substantial portion of the upper ( northern ) fov of the mos1 and pn detectors was contaminated ( contamination in the mos2 fov is apparently minimal ) and thus masked out from subsequent analysis .",
    "we produced counts and exposure maps for the three detectors , in the 0.8 - 1.5 , 1.5 - 2.2 and 2.2 - 7 kev bands .",
    "the low energy cutoff is justified by the relatively high foreground absorption near the galactic plane .",
    "we then merged the counts and exposure maps , accounting for the difference in the effective area among the three detectors .",
    "we also produced corresponding background maps , using the filter wheel closed data that characterizes the quiescent particle background .",
    "hess j1731 - 347 was observed by suzaku on feb .",
    "23 , 2007 ( obsid 401099010 ; pi : g. puehlhofer ) , with both x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ) @xcite and hard x - ray detector @xcite .",
    "the net exposure time is about 33 ks . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the xis front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds that have very high efficiency and low background especially around 5 kev .",
    "since the xis2 became inoperable since november 2002 , only data from xis0 is used here .",
    "we used cleaned version 2.0 data ( reduction by headas software version 6.5 ) .",
    "the suzaku fov is 18@xmath818 arcmin@xmath9 , centered at a bright compact source [ 17@xmath1032@xmath1110@xmath12 , -34@xmath1346@xmath14 .",
    "the suzaku spectra were extracted from a circular - source region with off - source annulus background region in the same observation so that possible contamination by snr emission is reduced to the minimum . in order to increase the statistics , the spectra from xis0 and xis3",
    "were jointly fitted for subsequent analysis .",
    "we observe the g353.6 - 0.7/hess j1731 - 347 system by employing the 13.7 meter delinha millimeter telescope at the purple mountain observatory in march 2008 .",
    "the telescope has an angular resolution of 55@xmath15 at the observing frequencies .",
    "simultaneously the three j=1 - 0 co isotopic lines ( i.e. , @xmath6co , @xmath16co , and @xmath17co ) were observed by using a cryogenic superconducting sis receiver and a multi - line backend spectroscopic system @xcite , but only the @xmath6co was bright enough for significant detection .",
    "the system provides a velocity coverage from v@xmath18= -150 to 60 km s@xmath2 and velocity resolution of 0.37 km@xmath2 in @xmath6co .",
    "three target spots ( see fig.1b ) , each with a size of 5@xmath19 , were selected over the g353.6 - 0.7 area , which includes the center position at the tev @xmath3-ray peak ( s1:[ra=17:32:00 , dec=-34:42:00 ] ) , and the _ rosat _ x - ray peak sites ( s2 : [ 173220 , -345400 ] , s3:[173250 , -344600 ] ) , respectively .",
    "these regions were mapped with a grid size of @xmath20 .",
    "each point was integrated up to 6 minutes , resulting an average rms noise level in the spectra to be 0.2 - 0.3  k. spectral line data were processed by the class package of gildas software developed by iram .",
    "fig .  1 shows the overall x - ray morphology revealed by _ xmm - newton _ , along with the radio continuum emission of g353.6 - 0.7 ( fig .",
    "1a ) and the @xmath3-ray emission of hess j1731 - 347 ( fig .",
    "the radio snr has a shell - like morphology and an extent of @xmath030@xmath7 in diameter , largely overlapping the extended hess source .",
    "on the eastern half of the snr , x - ray emission coincident with the radio emission was detected in an early _ rosat _ observation ( t08 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the present _ xmm - newton _ observation , although the lower ( southern ) part of the radio shell falls outside the _ xmm - newton _ fov .",
    "it is also evident that x - ray emission is present along the western half of the radio shell , which was not detected in the _ rosat _ observation albeit its larger fov .",
    "this can be understood , as the emission is detected only in the 2.2 - 7 kev band that is almost entirely beyond the _ rosat _ energy coverage .",
    "a number of x - ray substructures are revealed under the moderate spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton_. in particular , a prominent filament is present within the shell , passing through the brightest ( inner ) part of the hess source ( fig .",
    "1b ) and partially coincident with radio continuum emission ( fig .",
    "1a ) . with comparable widths of @xmath0@xmath21 ,",
    "the filament and the eastern x - ray shell together define a ring - like feature ( enclosed by the two dotted circles in fig .",
    "1a ; hereafter referred to as the ring ) , along which there are several bright knots ( highlighted by the small ellipses in fig .",
    "several plumes are present northwest of the ring , where the radio shell apparently breaks . from their projected positions ,",
    "it is not clear whether the plumes are the natural extent of the shell or the filament .",
    "furthermore , there is a bright compact source centering at ( r.a .",
    "= ( 17@xmath1032@xmath1103@xmath12 , -34@xmath1345@xmath718@xmath22 ) , showing no counterpart on the radio image .",
    "this source is named xmms j173203 - 344518 hereafter .",
    "the ring is not necessarily a coherent feature .",
    "nevertheless , subsequent analysis is focused on the x - ray emission along the ring , as it occupies the central portion of the _ xmm - newton _ fov that is not subject to the straylight contamination .",
    "2 shows the azimuthal distribution of the x - ray emission along the ring .",
    "individual peaks , e.g. , at position angles of @xmath0120@xmath13 , 190@xmath13 and 230@xmath13 , arise from the bright knots ( hereafter referred to as k1 , k2 and k3 ) . the ring appears harder on its western half ( i.e. , the filament , in angular range of 0@xmath13 - 180@xmath13 ) than on its eastern half ( i.e. , the shell ) .",
    "we will focus on the _ xmm - newton _ data because suzaku xis has a smaller fov and a lower spatial resolution ( @xmath0 1.8 arcmin ) than that of the _ xmm - newton_. we extract spectra , based on the mos1 , mos2 and pn data , from various regions along the ring , including the three knots , the eastern half of the ring ( k2 and k3 excluded ) , and the western half of the ring ( i.e. , the filament , k1 excluded ) . as the snr fills almost the entire fov ,",
    "an ideal selection of local background is not possible . we choose to adopt a background spectrum from a 25-radius concentric circle within the ring , where the intensity appears to be among the lowest values across the fov . given the high intensities along the ring , our background adoption is not expected to introduce significant bias to the spectral fit .",
    "an absorbed power - law model is found to be an acceptable characterization for almost all the spectra , resulting in absorption column densities of @xmath0@xmath23 and photon - index of @xmath02 , typical of non - thermal emission .",
    "the only exception is the spectrum of the eastern ring ( i.e. , the shell ) , for which the power - law model , with a steeper photon - index of @xmath02.7 , is not satisfactory fit .",
    "fitting the er spectra with a thermal or thermal+pl model does not lead to a better fit , hence we present the pl model fit for consistency with other spectra .",
    "the mos2 spectrum of the plumes northwest to the ring ( fig .",
    "1a ; the mos1 and pn data at this region are contaminated by straylight ) can also be fitted by an power - law with the index of about 2.2 , but subject to large uncertainty due to the limited counts .",
    "the fit results are summarized in table 1 . selected spectra and the best - fit models",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "all the spectra are binned to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 4 ( and a minimum of 30 counts per bin ) , ranging from about 50 to 350 bins .",
    "we also extract spectra for xmms j173203 - 344518 from both the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ xis data .",
    "the simple pure absorbed power - law model gives a steep photon index , i.e. @xmath05.1 for the _ xmm - newton _ spectra and @xmath04.7 for the suzaku spectra .",
    "however , the compact source spectra from both the _ xmm - newton _ and suzaku are better fitted by a combined model ( i.e. , blackbody plus power - law or two blackbodies ) . when the _ xmm - newton _ and suzaku data were fitted independently , the temperatures were found to be consistent with being equal ( @xmath0 0.5 kev ) . to better constrain spectral parameters we jointly fit the _ xmm - newton _ and suzaku spectra . for this joint - fit",
    "the column density and temperature were set equal for the _ xmm - newton _ and suzaku spectra ( the power - law photon - index is tied for both spectra also ) ; all other parameters were independent .",
    "both the blackbody plus power - law fit ( @xmath24/d.o.f.=252/260 ) and the two blackbodies fit ( @xmath24/d.o.f.=249/260 ) are good fits .",
    "we show the spectra and the blackbody plus powler - law best - fit model in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the fit parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "the compact source shows intrinsic flux in the suzaku observation a little higher than in the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "we discuss the nature of this source in   4 .",
    "the three co spectra ( s1 : j173200 - 344200 : s2 : j173220 - 345400 ; s3 : j173250 - 344600 ) all show several bright cloud components ( fig .",
    "4 ) . given a near kinematic distance of @xmath03.2 kpc for g353.6 - 0.7 , as inferred from the highest hi absorption feature at a velocity of @xmath0 -20@xmath14 km s@xmath2 ( t08 ) , these co spectra reveal increasing h@xmath25 column density ( @xmath0 2 , 3 and 6 @xmath810@xmath26 @xmath27 for s2 , s3 and s1 , respectively ; see discussion section ) towards the galactic plane .",
    "a bright cloud component at -20@xmath14 km s@xmath2 appears in the direction of s1 ( i.e. near the intensity peak of the hess source ) .",
    "this cloud is likely in front of the snr and extends to the nearby bright hii region g353.42 - 0.37 to produces the deep hi absorption feature at -20@xmath14 km s@xmath2 seen in the hi absorption spectrum from g353.42 - 0.37 .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the extended co cloud is associated with the remnant and locates at same distance of @xmath0 3.2 kpc as the hii region .",
    "a number of galactic tev objects are suggested to be pwne @xcite . in view of the proximity between xmms j173203 - 344518 and the projected centers of hess j1731 - 347 and snr g353.6 - 0.7",
    ", it is worth considering a pwn origin for the @xmath3-ray emission . in ",
    "3 we described that the spectra of xmms j173203 - 344518 can be approximated by a power - law model with a photon index of 4 - 5 , which is much steeper than the typical values of pwne @xmath0 1.5 - 2.1 @xcite .",
    "neither is this index reminiscent of background active galactic nuclei or galactic x - ray binaries , whose spectra , when fitted with a power - law model , show typical photon - index of @xmath0 1.5 - 2 .",
    "in addition , xmms j173203 - 344518 has no radio counterpart and no extended morphology .",
    "the above facts strongly argue against a possible pwn origin for the hess source .",
    "the source s spectra show a harder x - ray tail in the suzaku observation than in the _ xmm - newton _ observation ( fig .",
    "3 ) , so the source is a little brighter in the suzaku image than in the _ xmm - newton_. we have excluded the possible contamination by the snr emission , so the flux variability seems be real ( the suzaku observation is 26 days later than the _ xmm - newton _",
    "this x - ray variability is possibly consistent with that of a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) @xcite .",
    "we have examined the intra - observation ( tens of ks in duration ) light curves of the source but found no evidence for a flux variation , although we note that cvs do show x - ray variability on longer timescales .",
    "xmms j173203 - 344518 does not appear in the cvs catalog .    on the other hand , it is not implausible that xmms j173203 - 344518 is the central compact obejct ( cco ) associated with snr g353.6 - 0.7",
    ". typically found in young snrs , ccos are characterized by blackbody - like soft x - ray emission with temperatures of 0.2 - 0.5 kev @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that ccos are neutron stars born in supernova explosions with properties different from those of classical rotation - powered pulsars @xcite .",
    "xmms j173203 - 344518 shows a blackbody temperature ( @xmath00.5 kev ) higher than most ccos .",
    "we think that it is possibly a magnetar ( i.e. axps and sgrs ) , because magnetars have soft spectra , a typical blackbody temperature of @xmath00.5 kev and a typical luminosity of 10@xmath28 erg s@xmath2 @xcite , also see a magnetar catalogue .",
    "given a distance of @xmath0 3.2 kpc , if xmms j173203 - 344518 is associated with the snr , it will have a 1 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath0 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this perhaps means it is like axps more than sgrs , because sgrs usually have luminosities higher than axps , and this source so far shows no repeated soft @xmath3-ray emission .",
    "we examine the _ xmm - newton _ and suzuka light curves of xmms j173203 - 344518 and find no evidence for pulsations at frequencies between 0.05 - 1 hz , a range typical of magnetars .",
    "although magnetars often show a hard x - ray ( tens of kev ) tail that can be fitted by a shallow power law model , no counterpart of xmms j173203 - 344518 is found in the integral / isgri map ( in the energy range of 20 - 40 kev ) and integral / jemx map ( 3 - 15 kev ) .",
    "in addition , we notice that there is a little higher column density in the direction of xmms j173203 - 344518 than from other regions of snr g353.6 - 0.7(see table 1 ) .",
    "this may be caused by a local dense cloud .",
    "future x - ray observations are needed to test the magnetar scenario for xmms j173203 - 344518 .",
    "based on a statistics of 5 young snrs , the typical photon index of @xmath0 2.1 - 3.7 for non - thermal snrs has been suggested @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the hard x - ray emission of the ring in the hess j1731 - 347/snr g353.6 - 0.7 has similar photon index of @xmath0 2.2 .",
    "but the snr is old due to its extended ( @xmath0 30 arcmin in diameter ) and faint radio emission ( t08 ) so it should have a different high - energy mechanism .",
    "old snrs have quite different characteristics for the expected broad - band energy spectrum of accelerated electrons and protons than young snrs @xcite . as an snr ages , the acceleration time increases , allowing higher maximum energy of accelerated particles",
    ". however the losses also increase with time .",
    "the net result is that the electron spectrum is loss - limited when the snr is older than @xmath30 yr , but the proton spectrum only becomes loss - limited when the snr is older than @xmath31 yr .",
    "therefore , in an old snr , the @xmath3- and x - ray emissions are expected to be dominated respectively by decay of neutral pions and by synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons from charged pion decay , respectively .",
    "these pions all result from collisions of primary protons and the ism .",
    "one diagnostic is the ratio of tev to x - ray synchrotron fluxes .",
    "if the protons are accelerated at the shock running into a gmc , for example , the ratio should then be @xmath3210 , consistent with the value obtained for hess j1834 - 087 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the cloud is only illuminated by the particles , the predicted ratio should then be greater than 100 , due to the lack of magnetic field enhancement which would occur in the shock case ( hence greatly enhancing the x - ray synchrotron emission ) .    based on the best - fit models ( table 1 ) , the 2 - 10 kev unabsorbed flux from the ring ( including the three knots ) is found to be @xmath33 6.9 @xmath810@xmath34 ergs @xmath27 s@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3-ray flux is f@xmath35 @xmath33 1.7@xmath8 10@xmath36 ergs @xmath27 s@xmath2 in the 1 - 10 tev band ,",
    "so the ratio @xmath37 = f@xmath38/f@xmath39 is @xmath02.5 .",
    "a slightly lower value of @xmath37 is expected if the x - ray emission from the heavily absorbed western - shell is also considered .    for an old snr ( @xmath0 10@xmath40 yrs for snr g353.6 - 0.7 )",
    ", a theoretical model shows that the flux in the 1 - 10 tev band is a few times higher than that in 2 - 10 kev band if the tev emission is from pion - decays , the x - rays are from synchrotron emissions of secondary electron ( in the case of a shocked gmc ) .",
    "synchrotron emissions from secondary electrons are about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that from primary electrons .",
    "thermal x - ray emission is not considered in this model . however , there is little thermal emission originating from an old snr .",
    "the new fermi large area telescope survey released a strong @xmath3-ray source table in the range of 100 mev - 100 gev @xcite .",
    "there is no strong gev source within hess j1731 - 347 . for a case that tev",
    "@xmath3-ray and x - ray emissions originate from a shocked gmc , the gev emission flux is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that the tev flux ( fig . 5 of yamazaki et al . ) which is much low comparing with other cases ( figs . 2 - 6 of yamazaki et al .",
    ") , consistent with the explanation above .",
    "new co observations support such an snr scenario : an extended co cloud at @xmath0 20 km s@xmath2 is associated with the snr . from the spectrum of s1",
    ", we estimate an approximate h@xmath25 column density of @xmath0 4@xmath810@xmath26 @xmath27 within the cloud , taking x factor of @xmath0 2.5 @xmath810@xmath41 @xmath27 k@xmath2 km@xmath2s @xcite . assuming the molecular cloud completely covers the snr ( at least over the extended hess source region )",
    ", then it has a mass of @xmath42 = @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45(2m@xmath46/@xmath47 @xmath335@xmath8@xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "this is a gmc .",
    "s1 is located at the peak area of tev source , and has a higher local h@xmath25 column density than s2 and s3 .",
    "this is consistent with the model of a shocked gmc .",
    "the evidence of increasing column density from lower - latitude region to higher - latitude region of the snr revealed by the co spectra give a plausible reason on the x - rays distribution .",
    "the rosat x - ray image of snr g353.6 - 0.7 in the soft band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) appears only within the lower - latitude half of the radio remnant where the n@xmath46 is less than 10@xmath50 @xmath27 ( e.g. s3 and s2 ) because absorption blocks soft x - rays but not hard x - rays from the upper half where the n@xmath46 is larger than 10@xmath50 @xmath27 . from the viewing - angle of observers , this gives a physical image that the gmc covers the snr , so the tev emissions cover the x - ray and radio emission regions .",
    "the coincidence of the x - ray morphology with both the radio and tev @xmath3-ray morphologies suggests that they are physically associated .",

    "<S> we find that spatially - resolved x - ray spectra can generally be characterized by an absorbed power - law model , with photon - index of @xmath02 , typical of non - thermal emission . </S>",
    "<S> a bright x - ray compact source , xmms j173203 - 344518 , is also detected near the center of the snr . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence of a radio counterpart or an extended x - ray morphology for this source , making it unlikely to be a pulsar wind nebular ( pwn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the source can be well fitted by an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of @xmath00.5 kev plus a power - law tail with a photon - index of @xmath05 , reminiscent of the x - ray emission of a magnetar . </S>",
    "<S> co observations toward the inner part of the hess source reveal a bright cloud component at -20@xmath14 km s@xmath2 , which is likely located at the same distance of @xmath0 3.2 kpc as the snr . based on the probable association between the x - ray and @xmath3-ray emissions and likely association between the co cloud and the snr </S>",
