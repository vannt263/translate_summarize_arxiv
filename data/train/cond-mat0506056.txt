    "haldane integer - spin chains with antiferromagnetic coupling have been extensively studied experimentally as well as theoretically in the last two decades .",
    "this is due to their fascinating property conjectured by haldane @xcite .",
    "namely , in contrast to half - integer - spin chains , in integer - spin chains a quantum disordered singlet ground state with correlations decaying exponentially is separated from the lowest excited state ( spin gap ) . such character of the haldane chains with only the nearest - neighbor ( _ nn _ ) isotropic antiferromagnetic exchange coupling was satisfactory accounted for by the valence - bond - solid model @xcite , which introduced valence bonds emerging and terminating at neighboring sites .",
    "the validity of this model was experimentally confirmed for the first time in the spin @xmath3 compound nenp by observing @xmath4 liberated end - chain spins when a portion of the valence bonds was intentionally broken by introducing impurities to partially replace the @xmath3 spins @xcite .    in general ,",
    "impurities have been in the past often deliberately introduced to host materials and thus employed to reveal the magnetic character of the host .",
    "the instructive examples cover a variety of different low - dimensional quantum spin systems including high-_t_@xmath5 superconductors @xcite .",
    "moreover , the impurities can dramatically affect the ground state of the host material leading to unexpected magnetic phenomena .",
    "one of their most astonishing consequences is the induction of long - range magnetic ordering upon doping , an effect known as `` order - by - disorder effect '' @xcite , where disorder in a form of random doping causes magnetic ordering in the host material .",
    "this mechanism is known to set - in in different spin - gap systems including the spin - peierls compound cugeo@xmath6 substitutionally doped with different nonmagnetic @xcite or magnetic ions @xcite , the vacancy doped two - leg spin - ladder compound srcuo@xmath6 @xcite and the three - dimensional coupled - spin - dimer system tlcucl@xmath6 doped with nonmagnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "recently , also the first haldane - chain compound pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 that undergoes a transition to a magnetically ordered ground state at low temperatures when doped with either nonmagnetic @xcite mg@xmath0 or magnetic @xcite co@xmath0 , cu@xmath0 and mn@xmath0 ions on ni@xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) sites , was reported .",
    "there are several common features of the phase transitions in the above - mentioned systems , the first one being that already a very small amount of impurities induces long - range ordering .",
    "second , it appears universal that the phase - transition temperature increases as a function of the doping level at low concentrations and decreases at higher concentrations @xcite .",
    "therefore , a quest to find a unified pictures , which would satisfactory explain the impurity - induced long - range ordering in spin - gap systems , is currently underway .",
    "the way to magnetic ordering in the spin - gap systems is paved by clusters of exponentially decaying staggered moments induced next to the impurity sites @xcite , which are magnetically coupled through the gaped medium .",
    "weak coupling results in in - gap energy states , which dominate the low - temperature magnetic character of the doped systems .",
    "however , the picture of the impurity - induced magnetic ordering in spin - gap systems still remains rather unclear .",
    "in particular , the mechanisms leading to the development of three - dimensional intercluster spin correlations are particularly elusive . in order to elucidate this intriguing phenomenon",
    "it is crucial to develop a deeper understanding of the magnetic interactions within the pockets of the impurity - induced staggered moments as well as between them .",
    "therefore , we decided to act upon a comprehensive magnetic investigation of the haldane chain compound pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 doped with nonmagnetic mg@xmath0 and magnetic co@xmath0 impurities",
    ". the study incorporates macroscopic dc susceptibility measurements and local - scale magnetic resonance techniques , which already proved to yield invaluable information on the impurity - induced magnetism in mg - doped compounds @xcite .",
    "the results of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) are displayed in the present paper while the findings of the complementary nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements on ^51^v nuclei weakly coupled to electronic moments , are presented elsewhere @xcite . combining the results of the dc susceptibility measurements and the esr technique , we are able to evaluate the magnetic coupling within the impurity - induced pockets of staggered moments as well as to highlight the role of the intercluster coupling on the long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "polycrystalline samples were prepared by a solid - state reaction with the details of the procedure already been published @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the mg@xmath0 and co@xmath0 cations replacements for ni@xmath0 ions was experimentally verified by powder x - ray and neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "the presence of any impurity phases was limited below the sensitivity level of the x - ray diffractometer .",
    "dc magnetization measurements were performed on a quantum design squid magnetometer in a magnetic field of 100  mt down to 2  k. for esr measurement a bruker e580 ft / cw spectrometer was used .",
    "these measurements were conducted between room temperature and 5  k at a larmor frequency of @xmath7 ghz ( x - band ) .",

    "this experimental finding seems unusual in the light of the neutron diffraction performed on both compounds in the magnetically ordered state , suggesting a magnetic ordering of similar character .",
    "more specifically , purely magnetic neutron diffraction patterns indicate that the average magnetic moment per ni site pointing along the direction of the ni chains ( _ c _ axis ) is in both compounds close to @xmath17 @xcite . these measurements , however , can not yield information on the components of the magnetic moments perpendicular to the chains due to the uniaxial symmetry of the lattice and the powder nature of the samples",
    ". it has been recently argued by imai et al .",
    "@xcite that the observed irreversibility between the zfc and fc measurements is not a signature of a spin - glass behavior but should rather be due to the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism in co - doped samples , attributed to the presence of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "such antisymmetric anisotropic interaction is indeed present between ni spins @xcite , however , the general anisotropic exchange between impurity and host spins should be involved in the zfc / fc irreversibility .",
    "although the nominal concentrations of impurities in both samples are similar , the low - temperature peak in the magnetic susceptibility is much more pronounced in the mg - doped sample despite the fact that mg dopants are nonmagnetic .",
    "the uniform static spin susceptibility can be obtained from the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath18 , reflecting the distribution of the spectral weight of spin excitations ( the brackets @xmath19 denote statistical averaging ) .",

    "inset shown a linear dependence of the impurity - induced line broadening at 5  k and 10  k.,width=272 ]    where @xmath21 stands for the cauchy principle value .",
    "bering in mind that the static susceptibility is dominated by low - energy spin excitations , the intensities of the low - temperature magnetic susceptibility give a clear signal that the in - gap impurity - induced density of states is peaked at much lower frequencies when magnesium impurities are present .",
    "this is not surprising , as stronger magnetic coupling is expected in the case of cobalt impurities , which shifts the in - gap states to higher energies .",
    "moreover , our analysis based on the parameters obtained from the esr results , gives also a quantitative agreement , as demonstrated in the subsection [ xref - section-52103829 ] .",
    "as previously reported , x - band esr absorption spectra of the pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 are fairly broad at room temperature and further broaden with lowering the temperature @xcite .",
    "partial substitution of the magnetic ni@xmath0 ions with nonmagnetic mg@xmath0 ions results in additional broadening of the resonance lines , which moderately increases with the level of doping as clearly observed in fig .",
    "[ xref - figure-427115449]a . on the other hand , the case of co - doping results in extreme broadening of the esr spectra ( fig .",

    "all the spectra can be satisfactory fitted with a broad lorentzian function taking into account the resonant absorption at positive as well as negative resonant field . in addition , some samples require an extra narrow component , whose intensity proves to be sample dependent even within the same nominal stoichiometry .",
    "this fact allows us to attribute this additional signal to impurity phases present in the sample .",

    ", we were previously able to attribute the additional low - temperature signal in vacancy - doped samples to impurity - liberated end - chain degrees of freedom , which are delocalized on the scale of the correlation length @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it was further argued that these end - chain spins at both sides of a particular impurity were ferromagnetically coupled through interchain exchange providing a mechanism for three - dimensional magnetic ordering .",
    "such ferromagnetic coupling was indeed later experimentally confirmed by specific heat measurements reported by masuda et al . @xcite . the exact origin of the rather broad low - temperature esr signals still , however , remains to be revealed .",
    "the esr linewidth reflects the strength of the magnetic coupling between liberated spins , which makes its analysis invaluable for the understanding of the impurity - induced magnetism .    in co - doped samples we were able to follow the temperature evolution of the spectra below room temperature only in the case of the sample with the lowest doping level , i.e. , in pbni@xmath24co@xmath22v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "[ xref - figure-427125441 ] .",
    "it exhibits a rather different behavior from the case of the mg - doped materials as the linewidths of the two samples are clearly converging towards the same values when decreasing the temperature . to explain the extreme broadening of the esr spectra due to co@xmath0 ions and a bottleneck - type of the impurity - induced contribution to the esr linewidth , the spin nature of the dopants is successfully incorporated into the analysis in the next section .",
    "to rationalize the observed broadening of the esr spectra at room temperature due to doping ( fig .",
    "[ xref - figure-427115449 ] ) , we presume that the impurities do not have any noticeable effect on the crystal structure of the materials @xcite . since the dominant spin anisotropy contributions in the investigated materials are of single - ion anisotropy type @xcite and dm type @xcite , it can be assumed that they do not change appreciably at ni sites when dopants are introduced .",

    "in fact , the spin correlations can be significantly affected by impurities @xcite in low - dimensional systems , where the exchange pathways are severely limited and the diffusional decay of spin correlations at longer times becomes important @xcite .",
    "the rate of spin diffusion across the impurity site depends on the size of the impurity spin and the impurity - host exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "nonmagnetic impurities act as reflecting agents , disabling the spin polarization to diffuse away and thus effectively diminishing the exchange - narrowing mechanism .",
    "a significant impurity - induced broadening of the esr absorption lines is thus expected @xcite . however , the observed broadening , presented in fig .",
    "[ xref - figure-4271361]a , is not that prominent .",

    "hence the spin system behaves as three - dimensional on the x - band esr time - scale since the out - of - chain diffusion rate , given by @xmath40 , is larger than the esr frequency .",

    "the agreement with the experiment is rather good , especially if we recall that the impurity - induced susceptibility is given by @xmath112    although the experiment nicely follows the theoretical predictions , it should be noted that close to the phase - transition temperature the static spin - correlations effect makes the simple model picture unsuited .",
    "nevertheless , the puzzle of the size of the low - temperature spin susceptibility in co- and mg - doped pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 samples can be unambiguously unraveled . in the case of the vacancy doping ,",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling between the liberated end - chain spins is responsible for the upturn in the magnetic susceptibility . here",
    ", it should be stressed that the size of the coupling constant does not have any impact on the temperature dependence of the susceptibility .",
    "on the other hand , antiferromagnetic coupling in the case of the co - doped sample is responsible for the substantial suppression of the susceptibility in comparison to the mg - doped compound , as it shifts the weight of the in - gap states towards higher energies .",
    "an anisotropic exchange is expected in the case of the co@xmath0 ions , which further broadens the calculated peak in magnetic susceptibility .    at the end",
    ", a short comment on cu - doping is given .",
    "it was shown experimentally that the susceptibility curves of cu - doped pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 were virtually indistinguishable from curves corresponding to mg - doped compounds above the phase - transition temperature when the doping level of cu@xmath0 ions was twice the doping level of mg@xmath0 ions @xcite .",
    "this finding is in line with our results .",
    "namely , the antiferromagnetic exchange of cu@xmath0 impurities to ni@xmath0 spins is expected to have a high value , so that the low - energy excitations are solely given by the ferromagnetic coupling of the impurity - liberated spins .",
    "the ratio of the susceptibilities thus reflects the ratio of the effective spins @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper an explanation of the low - temperature magnetic properties in magnetically and nonmagnetically doped haldane compound pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 has been presented .",
    "the results of the dc magnetization and the electron spin resonance measurements were efficiently associated to provide an insight into the problem of the impurity - induced long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "the esr approach revealed the strength of the ferromagnetic coupling between spin degrees of freedom liberated at both sites of the vacancies in the case of nonmagnetic mg - doping , as well as the importance of the magnetic interactions between these delocalized spin clusters . on the other hand , we were also able to evaluate the impurity - host exchange in compounds doped with magnetic co@xmath0 impurities through the bottleneck - type of the impurity - induced broadening of the esr spectra .",
    "this coupling proved essential for the appearance of the in - gap magnetic excitations .",
    "it allowed a rather accurate prediction of the suppression of the low - temperature magnetic susceptibility in co - doped compounds through a simplified effective exchange model . additionally , the esr measurements revealed information about the thermal vibrations in the investigated system through the determination of the debye temperature .",
