    "according to one point of view , particles are an `` epiphenomenon '' and the fundamental theory is one of fields .",
    "others think that the foundations of physics are discrete , and that the continuous description is just a useful tool at some level .",
    "the former approach is fairly standard in theoretical physics , where one works out the `` quantization '' of classical fields . on the other hand ,",
    "various proposals going in the latter direction have appeared even recently and are actively researched . for a sample of some of the threads",
    "see e.g. : + e.p .",
    "verlinde , ` on the origin of gravity and the laws of newton ' , arxiv:1001.0785v1 ; + c.  rovelli , ` loop quantum gravity : the first twenty five years ' , arxiv:1012.4707v3 ; + r.d .",
    "sorkin , ` causal sets : discrete gravity ' , arxiv : gr - qc/0309009v1 .",
    "] so , the issue niels bohr thought he settled with his complementarity principle actually continues to stir debates .",
    "now the discrete aspects in the physics of quantum particles are evident , so a theory founded on continuous concepts has the problem of explaining how discreteness actually arises ; tentative arguments take a hint from the `` vibration modes '' of a bounded system ( e.g.  a string ) , but , as far as i know , no definitely convincing results have been obtained .",
    "furthermore , we may note that saying that the foundations of physics are continuous implies seeing the real numbers as a primitive concept . to me , this seems disputable .",
    "the field @xmath0 of reals is a highly abstract construction .",
    "its elements are defined to be certain equivalence classes of infinite sequences , and have many non - intuitive properties .",
    "most reals can not be characterized by finite information ( the real numbers we deal with in practice constitute a very small subset ) .",
    "the reason why they are so important is that in @xmath0 we can introduce a suitable notion of limit , and prove all those theorems which make calculus consistent .",
    "in other terms , the reals provide us with a powerful and sound context for calculations .",
    "this is not the same as saying that they are to be included into the fundamental notions of physics .",
    "i d rather say that taking the reals for granted , and including differentiable manifolds in the basic setting of a theory , amounts to starting from strong , involved assumptions .",
    "i m not convinced by the contrary argument that the real numbers are essential for calculations , and so should be included in the fundamental assumptions .",
    "this idea , that calculability ca nt be separated from the basic assumptions , is actually widespread in theoretical physics ; on the other hand one may contend that a conceptually clearer theory , based on simpler assumptions , may well require harder calculations ( this point was explicitly brought forward by einstein himself ) .",
    "several discussions of basic aspects of quantum mechanics concern experiments in which a particle source and a screen ( the detector ) are separated by polarizing filters , or by a wall with slits , or whatever . in young s experiment",
    "the wall has two slits , and in a classical context one would say that each particle passes through one slit . adjusting the source to be dimmer and dimmer ,",
    "the screen detects single particles ; the time separation between two conscutive flashes can be rendered large at will , but eventually the distribution of the flashes sums up to the same interference pattern determined by the bright source ( that pattern is destroyed if one tries to detect the particles at the slits ) .",
    "so we detect certain quantum events , the absorption of single particles , and we have good reasons to assume that each event is correlated to an event occuring at the source , the emission of one particle .",
    "it s then natural to view the particle _ exactly _ as this correlation between two observed events .",
    "though our ( classical ) mental habits would suggest that ` something ' has traveled from the first event to the second , this is not the right description at a more fundamental level .",
    "the two events and their ( abstract ) correlation are just everything that can be regarded as `` real '' .",
    "now suppose that some external observer looks at our universe , not being subjected to our universe s time , and sees the whole spacetime at one glance ( the kosmos from the beginning to the end ) .",
    "this object looks to the observer as a ( for us , huge and extremely complex ) network of correlated events . considering a particular photon",
    ", the observer might see that a certain event , occured at recombination era 400,000 years after the big bang , is correlated with an event occured at a radiotelescope on earth 14 billion years after the big bang .",
    "he might say that a photon was emitted at the recombination era and detected 14 billion years later , but _ not _ that something was wandering all this time through the cosmos , waiting to be detected . for the observer , only events and their correlations exist .",
    "we humans ca nt observe the kosmos in the same way but may have , at some given time , an incomplete knowledge .",
    "we may have detected an emission event , or know that it has occurred , but could not spot ( at least , not yet ) the correlated absorption event , which however _ must _ occur somewhere , at some time .",
    "this does not mean that we can say nothing about it , actually we can calculate _ quantum probabilities _ : knowing about the emission event allows one to calculate the probability that the absorption event takes place in a certain position at a given time .",
    "the network of correlated events , where each correlation is called a `` particle '' , constitutes a discrete structure ; now , rather than assume that it is contained in something else , we could view it as the fundamental reality , at least as far as our investigation can go .",
    "perhaps there exists no underlying continuum , and spacetime and its metric arise as mathematical notions which are suitable for describing the universe on macroscopic scales",
    ". they might be of a statistical nature , analogous to thermodynamical functions .",
    "thus a consistent formulation of the fundations of physics could be achieved not requiring a unification in the usual sense that all interactions should be on the same footing . in particular , gravitation could be seen as a kind of `` residual '' force , emerging in the macroscopic description and not mediated by any particle . though this sounds similar to verlinde s ideas , .",
    "] actually i see it as a more radical ansatz , involving the complete elimination of the geometry from fundamental notions .",
    "it s also , in my opinion , the most possible _ relational _ ansatz .",
    "as far as i know , the closest ideas to what i m trying to convey , in the literature , have been expressed by penrose .",
    "let me quote a few sentences of his :     the idea is to concentrate only on things which _ are _ discrete in existing theory and try and use them as _",
    "primary concepts_then to build up other things using these primary concepts as the basic building blocks .",
    "continuous concepts could emerge in a limit , when we take more and more complicate systems .",
    "...    the central idea is that _ the system defines the geometry _ ... the notion of space comes out as a _ convenience _ at the end .",
    "    though several developments  regge calculus , the theory of spin networks , loop gravity  are in some way related to those ideas , i m not aware that that program has been carried on to the point of obtaining definite results supporting such clear - cut positions .",
    "thus i d like to speculate a little about how one could try and exploit the above arguments in order to construct a true theory .",
    "l3.7 cm    ( 100,80 ) ( 0,-15 )    consider a chunk of the network of events , and draw the correlations as lines of various types .",
    "well , i know that this resembles a feynman diagram , and that such diagrams are to be considered just helps for calculations , having nothing to do with reality ; however i m not going to treat it really as a feynman diagram , and certainly i m not saying that the lines represent paths in some space , so please follow me for the moment .",
    "the lines here bear various types of labels , but none is related to spacetime in any way .",
    "let s say that the labels refer to an `` internal '' structure .",
    "since this diagram is only a piece of the big structure , it has `` external legs '' .",
    "our fundamental problem could then be formulated as follows : given a large such network , find out how the internal structure may yield some kind of geometric relations among the external legs .",
    "these relations wo nt be exact , but only determined up to some degree of precision , which we expect to be bigger the larger the considered network . in practice",
    "we ll have to study possible ways , compatible with the internal structure , of immersing the network into some hypothetic geometry ; note that this immersion can be ( partially ) determined only up to certain transformations of the geometry ( only the geometrical relations among the external legs have physical meaning ) .",
    "furthermore , note that we do nt need to leave this hypothetic large scale geometry completely undetermined ; actually we may choose one as part of our theoretical assumptions , then one task of our study will be to understand how reasonable our choice was ( by the way , this point is deeply related to the philosphical question of the modalities of knowledge , which i wo nt examine here ) .",
    "now let me quote penrose again :    `` the most obvious physical concept that one has to start with , where quantum mechanics says something is discrete , and which is connected to the structure of space - time in a very intimate way , is in _",
    "angular momentum_. ''    actually spin , or `` intrinsic angular momentum '' , is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of the internal structure of particles ; its intimate and subtle relation to spacetime geometry must have a deep explanation .",
    "now i suggest that , rather than dealing with arbitrary spin networks , we could get to the core of the question by restricting our attention to a simplified situation in which spin can only take the values @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; this encompasses electrodynamics , which is essentially the source of almost all everyday physics , classical and quantum ( excluding gravity , which we aim at treating on a different footing , and nuclear physics ) .",
    "l3.7 cm    ( 100,80 ) ( 0,-15 )    a chunk of the network of events , with the lines indicating correlation stripped of all the internal structure except what is needed for the present argument , could appear as illustrated here .",
    "wavy lines and straight lines represent ( as in usual feynman diagrams ) photons ( spin @xmath2 ) and fermions ( spin @xmath1 ) , respectively ; the arrows indicate the fermions charge sign ; different fermion masses may be allowed .",
    "then , armed with one s knowledge of the mathematical relation between spin and the lorentz metric of classical spacetime , one can study possible correspondences of the legs with vectors in minkowski space ; possibly we might eventually find that a curved structure is needed for better fitting .",
    "this aspect could be related to regge calculus , but note that i propose that the particles themselves be the network s edges .    as for the calculation of quantum probabilities",
    ", at least one basic question could be formulated not so differently from standard perturbative high energy physics : given a set of `` external legs '' , try to associate a probability to it by taking into account ( at least in principle ) all possible networks having those external legs .",
    "i know no details of how the above cues could be followed in practice , of course ( otherwise i d have already published them ) .",
    "let s suppose , however , that the scheme works more or less as imagined , and that , quoting penrose a further time , we succeeded in `` building up both space - time and quantum mechanics simultaneously  from combinatorial principles '' ; then we d have reached the goal of a peaceful cohabitation of quantum and gravitational physics .",
    "note , however , that neither is actually a fundamental theory in this ansatz .",
    "perhaps , rather than going on by building on existing theories by adding more and more complicate features , we could try and change our point of view of what is really fundamental .    by the way",
    ", i see this attitude as an expression of ockham s principle , `` entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity '' , which today seems to be more often forgotten than not .",
    "imagine a very powerful computer , where a simulation of some virtual world was implemented from basic entities",
    ". certain rules of behaviour ( call them `` physical laws '' ) have been assigned to these entities ( `` elementary particles '' ) .",
    "eventually the simulation grows so complex that intelligent beings are born in this world , and begin to wonder about the ultimate nature of it .",
    "how far can they reach in their quest ?",
    "they could be so smart as to guess the `` physical laws '' , namely to understand the _ software _ of the simulation ; but the knowledge of the hardware and of the programmer will be forever unattainable for them ( unless the programmer decides to insert some special communication ) .",
    "well , this is utter speculation , hardly bearing any scientific weight ; but should we find that the foundations of physics are actually discrete , then we d be quite naturally led to see them as some kind of software ."
