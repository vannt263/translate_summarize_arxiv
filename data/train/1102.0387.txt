    "coherent control of electronic , photonic or matter wave transport in driven semiconductor superlattices , quantum dots , waveguide arrays and optical lattices has received a great and continuous interest over the past two decades @xcite , stimulating a wide number of experimental and theoretical investigations in different physical systems @xcite .",
    "examples of coherent control by the application of ac fields include , among others , the coherent destruction of tunneling between two wells in a bistable potential @xcite and the suppression of quantum diffusion and dynamic localization in tight - binding lattices @xcite .",
    "such phenomena have been demonstrated in a series of recent experiments @xcite , mainly based on transport of light waves or cold atoms in waveguide arrays or optical lattices , where dephasing and many - body effects can be neglected .",
    "other interesting phenomena occur in the tunneling and scattering processes of ac - driven free particles across potential wells or barriers @xcite .",
    "in particular , a freely - moving quantum particle can be resonantly transmitted across a periodically - driven rectangular potential barrier , in spite the probability of tunneling through the static potential barrier is almost zero @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , originally predicted for quantum tunneling and referred to as field - induced barrier transparency @xcite , is rather generic and can be similarly observed for optical tunneling at modulated dielectric interfaces @xcite . in the accelerated ( kramers - henneberger ) reference frame , the ac - driven barrier behaves like a periodically - shaken potential barrier @xcite . at high oscillation frequencies , the oscillating rectangular barrier can be replaced at leading order by its cycle - averaged ( static ) barrier , whose profile shows a characteristic double - hump shape that sustains metastable states .",
    "thus resonant transmission of the incident particles across the ac - driven barrier observed at certain below - barrier energies can be simply explained as a resonant tunneling process , similar to e.g. the ramsauer - townsend effect , the resonant electronic tunneling across a double - barrier structure , or the resonant light transmission of light in a fabry - perot optical cavity . in this work",
    "we consider the coherent motion of a bloch particle in a tight - binding lattice with a strong impenetrable rectangular potential barrier , and demonstrate that the application of an ac field with appropriate amplitude and frequency can make the potential barrier fully transparent .",
    "this phenomenon , which can be again referred to as field - induced barrier transparency for bloch particles in analogy to its counterpart for free particles , has however a very different origin .",
    "in particular , barrier transparency is observed for incident bloch waves at _ any _ allowed energy in the band , i.e. it is not related to resonant tunneling of the cycled - averaged potential as in the free particle case .",
    "here we investigate the phenomenon of field - induced barrier transparency of bloch waves by considering photonic transport in periodically - curved waveguide lattices @xcite , however the present analysis is rather generic to coherent transport in driven tight - binding lattices and could be therefore of interest to other physical set ups , such as to cold atoms or bose - einstein condensates in accelerated optical lattices @xcite . + the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the basic model is described with specific reference to light transport in photonic lattices , and a theoretical analysis of field - induced barrier transparency in ac - driven tight - binding lattices is presented . in sec.iii the theoretical predictions obtained in the high - frequency regime",
    "are confirmed by direct numerical simulations , based on both the time - periodic coupled - mode equations of the driven tight - binding lattice and the schrdinger wave equation with a one - dimensional potential .",
    "deviations from the predictions based on the averaged lattice model in the high frequency modulation limit , such as a shift of the resonant curves , are briefly discussed .",
    "finally , in sec.iv the main conclusions are outlined .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is provided by a standard model of light transport in a one - dimensional array of tunneling - coupled optical waveguides with a periodically - curved optical axis @xcite . in the waveguide reference frame ,",
    "light transport is described by the following schrdinger - type wave equation for the electric field envelope @xmath0 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath1     ( solid curve ) of a one - dimensional lattice with a barrier , composed by the superposition of the periodic optical potential ( lattice period @xmath2 ) and of the rectangular barrier potential ( height @xmath3 , width @xmath4 , represented by the dashed curve in the figure ) .",
    "the dotted curve in the figure is the intensity profile of the incident gaussian wave packet in the numerical simulations of sec.iii.b .",
    "( b ) band diagram ( three lower - order bands ) of the periodic optical potential .",
    "the energy in the vertical axis is defined as the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath5 of the periodic potential entering in eq.(1 ) .",
    "( c ) space - energy band diagram of the lattice with the rectangular barrier .",
    "the height @xmath3 of the barrier is larger than the bandwidth @xmath6 of the lowest lattice band , but smaller than the gap separating the first two bands .",

    "is a fictitious refractive index gradient arising from axis bending and with a @xmath12-varying slope given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the axis bending profile and the dot indicates the derivatives with respect to @xmath12 @xcite . in its present form ,",
    "the paraxial wave equation ( 1 ) is formally equivalent to the schrdinger equation describing the dynamics of a quantum particle of mass @xmath10 in the potential @xmath13 driven by a time - dependent external force @xmath17 , provided that the spatial @xmath12 variable in the optical system is replaced by the temporal variable in the quantum problem , and the photon wavelength @xmath18 is replaced by the panck s constant .",
    "the potential @xmath19 is given by the superposition of the periodic and barrier potentials , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the periodic potential describing a homogeneous array of equally - spaced wells , and @xmath22 is the barrier potential , which is assumed to describe a rectangular barrier of height @xmath3 and width @xmath23 [ see fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "the role of the barrier potential is to introduce a step , of height @xmath3 , into a finite number of wells in the lattice , say from the waveguide @xmath24 to the waveguide @xmath25 , as shown in fig.1(a ) . the potential height @xmath3 is typically assumed to be much larger than the width of the lowest energy band of the array , yet smaller than the gap between the first and second lattice bands , as shown as an example in fig.1(c ) . in this way , in the absence of the ac driving force any bloch wave packet , belonging to the lowest band of the lattice and traveling along the lattice , is reflected from the potential barrier [ see fig.1(c ) ] . to study the role of the ac driving force and the possibility to make the barrier transparent ,",
    "let us introduce the nearest - neighboring tight - binding approximation and let us assume that the lattice is mostly excited in its lowest - order bloch band .",
    "such conditions are satisfied , for example , by considering an array of weakly - coupled waveguides which is initially excited by a broad beam tilted at an angle smaller than the bragg angle @xmath8 @xcite . under such assumptions , from eq .",
    "( 1 ) the following coupled - mode equations can be derived @xcite @xmath26 for the amplitudes @xmath27 of the field trapped in the individual waveguides , where @xmath28 is the coupling constant between adjacent waveguides , @xmath29 is the normalized forcing , @xmath30 and @xmath31 to study field - induced barrier transparency , it is worth introducing , in place of @xmath27 , the amplitudes @xmath32 defined by the relations @xmath33,\\ ] ] so that eqs.(2 ) take the form @xmath34 where we have set @xmath35.\\ ] ] let us now assume a sinusoidal bending of waveguide axis with spatial frequency @xmath36 and amplitude @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 so that @xmath39 where @xmath40 let us also assume that : + ( i ) the barrier height @xmath3 and the quanta of modulation @xmath41 are much larger than the width @xmath42 of the tight - binding energy band ; + ( ii ) the modulation frequency is chosen such that the resonant condition @xmath43 is satisfied for some ( small ) integer @xmath44 ( typically @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) . in the high - modulation frequency limit [ assumption ( i ) ] , at first order in a multiple - scale asymptotic analysis of eqs.(7 ) the spatial evolution of the amplitudes @xmath32 is dominated by the cycle - average coupling rates @xmath47 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , i.e. one has @xmath48 taking into account that @xmath49=\\sum_n j_n(\\gamma ) \\exp(i",

    "however , if the amplitude @xmath37 of modulation is tuned such that @xmath53 the effective lattice is homogeneous ( i.e. defect - free ) , and thus any bloch wave packet propagates in the lattice without being reflected @xcite .",
    "that is , if the modulation frequency and amplitude are tuned to satisfy the conditions ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) , the effect of the ac driving is to make the barrier @xmath54 fully transparent for bloch wave packets belonging to the lowest energy band .        ) and transmission ( @xmath55 ) coefficients of a gaussian wave packet at the first barrier discontinuity near the first transparency resonance @xmath56 numerically computed ( a ) using the tight - binding model ( 2 ) , and ( b ) the full wave equation ( 1 ) .",
    "parameter values in the two cases are given in the text . ]",
    "in this section we confirm , by direct numerical simulations of both the tight - binding equations ( 2 ) and the full wave equation ( 1 ) , the field - induced barrier transparency phenomenon predicted in the previous section in the high - frequency modulation regime .",
    "let us first consider beam reflection and transmission in the tight - binding lattice model described by the coupled - mode equations ( 2 ) with periodic coefficients",
    ". equations ( 2 ) have been numerically integrated using an accurate fourth - order variable - step runge - kutta methods with absorbing boundary conditions . as an example , figs.2(a - d ) ( upper panels ) show the numerically - computed evolution of lattice site occupation probabilities @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath56 and for a few increasing values of the modulation amplitude , measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 . for comparison ,",
    "the lower panels in figs.2(a - d ) show the corresponding evolution of occupation probabilities as obtained by integration of the averaged effective lattice equations [ eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) ] , valid in the high modulation frequency limit .",
    "the array is initially excited by a gaussian distribution @xmath61 \\exp(iqn)$ ] with mean position @xmath62 , width @xmath63 and momentum @xmath64 ( corresponding to the largest cycle - averaged group velocity far from the barrier ) .",
    "note that at @xmath65 , at which the condition ( 16 ) is satisfied for @xmath45 , the wave packet is not reflected , and the barrier appears to be fully transparent [ see fig.2(c ) ] . in the simulations shown in fig.2 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath66 is large enough to ensure the validity of the averaged equations ( 13 ) , at least at first - order approximation .",
    "in fact , a more careful comparison of the results obtained from the original coupled - mode equations with periodic coefficients [ eqs.(2 ) or ( 7 ) ] and the averaged equations ( 13 ) shows some slight discrepancies , which basically arise from neglecting higher - order terms in the asymptotic analysis of eqs.(7 ) ( for more details see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular , according to the average model ( 13 ) , transparency should be observed regardless of the initial value of wave packet momentum @xmath67 , i.e. of its mean energy ; however , numerical simulations of the original ( periodic ) coupled - mode equations ( 2 ) show that some reflected light is observed at the barrier when the initial wave packet momentum @xmath67 ( i.e. , its mean group group velocity ) is reduced .",
    "this is shown , as an example , in figs.2(e ) and ( f ) , where the evolution of lattice site occupation probabilities are depicted for the same initial gaussian wave packet of fig.2(c ) ( i.e. at the transparency condition ) , but with an initial momentum lowered to @xmath68 [ fig.2(e ) ] and @xmath69 [ fig.2(f ) ] .",
    "another difference between the average and periodic coupled - mode equations can be seen by computing the first resonance curve of the transparency process , depicted in fig.3(a ) .",
    "the figure shows the behavior of the power reflection @xmath70 and transmission @xmath55 coefficients versus @xmath71 ( near the first resonance @xmath72 ) for the same initial gaussian wave packet with momentum @xmath64 , as obtained by numerical integration of eqs.(2 ) . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath55 have been computed by considering the first potential step solely of the barrier , so that multiple reflections that would arise in the presence of the two potential discontinuities of the rectangular barrier [ see , for example , fig.2(b ) ] are avoided . for each modulation frequency @xmath71 ,",
    "the modulation amplitude @xmath37 was correspondingly varied such that the ratio @xmath60 [ see eq.(15 ) ] remains constant and equal to 1.435 , at which the condition ( 16 ) is satisfied .",
    "note that , the condition of exact transparency ( @xmath73 ) is attained at the ratio @xmath74 , which is slightly smaller than @xmath75 , as expected from the averaged model [ eq.(12 ) with @xmath45 ] . as discussed above",

    ", @xmath92 m the diffusion length , and @xmath93 the peak index change .",
    "the waveguide spacing ( lattice period ) is @xmath94 m , and the substrate refractive index at the probing wavelength is @xmath95 .",
    "the band structure of the lattice , numerically computed by a standard plane - wave expansion method , is shown in fig.1(b ) . from the width of the lowest order ( tight - binding ) lattice band",
    ", a coupling rate @xmath96 can be estimated between adjacent waveguides .",
    "when the lattice is excited by a broad wave packet , tilted at an angle @xmath7 , it generally breaks up into the superposition of different wave packets , belonging to the various lattice bands and refracting at different angles ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the fractional excitations of the different lattice bands are given by the bloch - wave excitation coefficients @xmath97 , defined as in ref.@xcite .",
    "figure 1(d ) shows the numerically - computed behavior of @xmath98 for the various lattice bands of the periodic part of the optical potential of fig.1(a ) versus the tilt angle @xmath7 of the incident beam , in units of the bragg angle @xmath8 .",
    "as one can see , for broad input beams tilted at an angle @xmath7 smaller than half of the bragg angle , the lowest - order lattice band is mainly excited , which indicates that in this case the tight - binding model of sec.ii can be safely applied .",
    "the barrier height used in the numerical simulations is @xmath99 , whereas its width is @xmath100 m .",
    "a schematic of the space - dependent band diagram of the lattice , shown in fig.1(c ) , clearly indicates that , in the absence of the external ac field , the barrier is impenetrable and any bloch wave packet , incident onto the barrier , is reflected .",
    "this is shown , as an example , in fig.4(a ) , where the numerically - computed evolution of the field intensity @xmath101 along the non - modulated lattice is depicted by assuming , as an initial condition , the tilted gaussian beam @xmath102 \\exp(2 \\pi i   \\theta x /\\lambda)$ ] with spot size @xmath103 m , offset @xmath104 m [ see the dotted curve in fig.1(a ) ] and tilt angle @xmath105 .",
    "let us now introduce a sinusoidal modulation of the axis bending @xmath16 at a spatial frequency @xmath106 close to the first resonance [ @xmath45 in eq.(12 ) ] , which corresponds to a spatial modulation period @xmath107 mm .",
    "note that the ratio between modulation frequency @xmath71 and coupling rate @xmath108 of waveguides turns out to be @xmath109 , i.e. the high frequency modulation condition is well satisfied .",
    "figures 4(b - d ) show the evolution of the same gaussian wave packet as in fig.4(a ) but in the periodically - curved waveguide array for increasing values of the modulation amplitude @xmath37 , measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath78 given by eq.(15 ) .",
    "note that the cycle - averaged transverse group velocity of the wave packet , far from the barrier region and at the tilting angle @xmath83 , is equal to @xmath110 , and thus decreases as @xmath78 is increased from zero [ fig.4(a ) ] to @xmath82 [ fig.4(d ) ] . as the modulation is increased ,",
    "the gaussian wave packet is less and less reflected from the barrier , till a nearly reflectionless regime , corresponding to full barrier transparency , is attained when the transparency condition ( 16 ) is reached [ see fig.4(c ) ] .",
    "barrier transparency is observed at different values of the initial tilt angle @xmath7 ( i.e. initial wave packet momentum ) , expect for small tilt angles at which the wave packet shows a more complex dynamics at the barrier crossing ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "this behavior , already noticed in sec.ii in the framework of the tight - binding analysis , is mainly ascribable to a discrepancy between the average model [ eq.(13 ) ] and the original coupled - mode equations with periodic coefficients [ eqs.(2 ) or ( 7 ) ] .",
    "a slight discrepancy can be also seen when computing the resonance curve of the field - induced barrier transparency process using the full wave equation ( 1 ) , similarly to what already noticed within the tight - binding model [ see fig.3(a ) ] . in fig.3(b ) , the numerically - computed power reflection ( @xmath70 ) and transmission ( @xmath55 ) coefficients versus @xmath71 ( near the first resonance @xmath72 ) are depicted for the gaussian wave packet of fig.4 . like for the resonance curve computed using the tight - binding model [ fig.3(a ) ] , the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath55 have been calculated by considering the first potential step solely of the barrier , and for each modulation frequency @xmath71 the modulation amplitude @xmath37 was correspondingly varied such that @xmath111 .",
    "note that , as in fig.3(a ) , the resonance frequency turns out to be slightly smaller than the theoretical value @xmath112 predicted by the averaged model .",
    "+ as a concluding remark , it is important to stress that , as compared to the phenomenon of field - induced barrier transparency for a freely - moving quantum particle @xcite in which particle transmission occurs solely at special values of initial momentum ( energy ) that match the metastable states of the cycle - average potential barrier , the phenomenon of barrier transparency for bloch wave packets predicted in this work is relatively insensitive to the initial wave packet momentum and can not thus be ascribed to a resonant tunneling phenomenon as for the free particle .",
    "however , as opposed to the case of ref.@xcite , where the frequency and amplitude of the ac field may take relatively arbitrary values @xcite , in our system the modulation frequency as well as the modulation amplitude should satisfy certain resonance conditions , namely eqs.(12 ) and ( 16 ) .",
    "in this work it has been theoretically shown that a rectangular potential barrier for a bloch particle in a tight - binding lattice can be made fully transparent by the application of a strong ac field with appropriate amplitude and frequency . as this phenomenon bears some connection with the field - induced barrier transparency phenomenon previously predicted for freely - moving quantum particles scattered by an ac - driven potential barrier @xcite , the transparency effect for the bloch particle has a rather different physical origin , as discussed in this work .",
    "in particular , in the high - frequency limit transparency is attained independently of the energy of the bloch wave packet , and therefore particle transmission across the barrier can not be explained as a resonant tunneling process across the cycle - averaged potential , as for a freely moving particle @xcite . this phenomenon could be experimentally observed in periodically - curved waveguide arrays , where light transport along the lattice mimics the coherent temporal evolution of a bloch particle with an external ac driving field @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations based on the paraxial ( schrdinger ) wave equation have also shown that the phenomenon of field - induced barrier transparency persists beyond the tight - binding approximation , provided that the lattice is initially excited by a broad beam tilted at an angle smaller than the bragg angle .",

    "<S> a rectangular potential barrier for a bloch particle in a tight - binding lattice is shown to become fully transparent by the application of a strong ac field with appropriate amplitude and frequency . </S>",
    "<S> such a curious phenomenon bears some connection with the field - induced barrier transparency effect known for freely - moving particles scattered by an ac - driven rectangular barrier ; however , for a bloch particle transparency is not related to a resonant tunnneling process across the cycle - averaged oscillating potential barrier , as for the freely - moving quantum particle . the phenomenon of field - induced transparency is specifically discussed here for photonic transport in waveguide arrays and demonstrated by full numerical simulations of the paraxial ( schrdinger ) wave equation beyond the tight - binding approximation . </S>"
