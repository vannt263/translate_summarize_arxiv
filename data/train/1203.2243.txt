    "euclid s fifth postulate ( called also the eleventh or twelfth axiom ) states : `` if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles , the two straight lines if produced indefinitely meet on that side on which are the angles less than two right angles . ''",
    "the earliest commentators found fault with this statement as being not self - evident [ 1 ] .",
    "euclid uses terms such as `` indefinitely '' and makes logical assumptions that had not been proven or stated .",
    "thus the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others .    for two thousand years",
    ", many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using euclid s first four postulates .",
    "finally the mathematical society have proven the consistency of non - euclidean plane geometry and the independence of the euclidean parallel postulate ; and extend that in stating that it would be impossible to prove euclid s parallel postulate from the other assumptions made by him , since this would involve the denial of the parallel postulate of bolyai and lobatschewsky [ 2 ] .",
    "this conclusions mainly derived from beltrami s ( 1868 ) seminal papers concerning the existence of non - euclidean objects and by the arguments offered by jules houel in 1860 - 1870 for the unprovability of the parallel postulate and for the existence of non - euclidean geometries .",
    "the final step towards rigorous consistency proofs is taken in the 1880s by henri poincare .",
    "what houel sees in beltrami s putative demonstration that regions of pseudospheres are complete bolyai - lobatschewsky planes is the presentation of an instance in which all of the properties of the euclidean plane are present except for the property of unique parallelism [ 3 ] .",
    "a trivial example will make the principle evident . if we wish to show that the property of upright posture in mammals does not imply intelligence ( in this sense of implication ) , it is sufficient to show that there are some mammals in which upright posture is present without intelligence ( kangaroos ) , even though there may be others in which upright posture occurs together with intelligence ( humans ) .",
    "the application of the result here to the human case , e.g. if we want to say that upright posture in humans does not imply their intelligence , turns on referring to the same properties in the case of both humans and kangaroos ( scanlan 1988 ) .",
    "it s obvious that the independence of the euclidean parallel postulate is well formed , but a detailed looked at the writings will show that some claims may are overstated or misinterpreted .",
    "the most striking example of a non - logical use of the word ",
    "independent  is in bolyai s title of his famous appendix , one of the founding texts of hyperbolic geometry , absolute geometry : independent of the truth or falsity of euclid s axiom xi ( which can never be decided a priori ) .",
    "bolyai does not , of course , claim that the parallel postulate is independent from the rest of euclidean geometry in the sense required to show that the parallel postulate is unprovable ( though he does claim that it can not be proven ) .",
    "he means simply that he can prove some theorems of geometry without relying on either the parallel postulate or its negation [ 4 ] .",
    "sometimes , it was simply stated that the attempt to prove the parallel postulate had gone on too long and that repeated lack of success shows that it is impossible to prove the parallel postulate . on the other hand",
    "the geometers working in order to support the existence of non - euclidean objects were in the pursue of some very impressive results .",
    "that s why beltrami s work had a profound impact on houel .",
    "houel immediately after he saw it , announced that beltrami had shown that it is impossible to prove the parallel postulate .",
    "strikingly , he made this announcement in eight different journals .",
    "in reality they wanted to strongly support and consolidate the initial hypothesis of the acute angle .",
    "the geometers had made just another logical assumption , believing that by finding a contradiction to saccheri s quadrilateral would weaken the foundations of non - euclidean geometries .",
    "we can also realize that some statements was nt very well formed or may were just some logical assumptions and we have to treat them with the same way we did with the logical assumptions that euclid did .",
    "h. s. carslaw ( 1909 ) states :  how ever far the hyperbolic geometry were developed , no contradictory results could be obtained `` .",
    "stating ' ' how ever far  is nt it equivalent with the term  indefinitely  that euclid uses ?",
    "finally , let us consider the following : `` for every diameter of @xmath0 let us imagine another point at infinity such that all the euclidean lines parallel in the euclidean sense to this diameter meet in this point at infinity , just as railroad tracks appear to meet at horizon .",
    "these points at infinity will also be called ultra ideal''[5 ] . by imagining that the euclidean lines meet to a point at infinity we managed to show that these lines are parallel to the diameter @xmath0 , but are not parallel to each other .",
    "nevertheless , in a specific area , by construction , we have lines that are parallel to each other due to the fact that they are parallel to a third line , something that we can not succeed without using the euclidean sense of parallelism .",
    "finding a contradiction on the three hypotheses made by saccheri does not mean that the non - euclidean geometries are nt consistent .",
    "it means that we can apply euclid s proposition at these geometries without deconstruct them , because the independence of the euclidean parallel postulate is bidirectional .",
    "it means that non - euclidean geometries are independent from the euclidean parallel postulate and that the postulate , it self , is also independent from the geometries that exist in the euclidean field .",
    "this concludes , that we can build relations without using it , but in the same time we can apply it anywhere we choose , without deconstructing our work . in reality",
    "euclid did exactly the same thing , using the parallel axiom after the first 28 propositions .",
    "thus was euclid `` vindicated '' in an unexpected manner .",
    "knowingly or not , the wise greek had stated the case correctly , and only his followers had been at fault in their efforts for improvement [ 1 ] .",

    "[ [ section ] ]    the angles adjacent to the opposite sides of a quadrilateral , which are perpendicular to the base , are shorter or greater , if they are adjacent , respectively , to the greater or shorter sides . and they are equal if they adjacent to equal sides ( corresponds to the lemma i of g. saccheri ) .    [ [ proof ] ] proof : + + + + + +    in quadrilateral ab@xmath1@xmath2 ( figure 1 ) we are given that angles a@xmath2@xmath1 and b@xmath1@xmath2 are right angles and sides a@xmath2 and b@xmath1 are equal . drawing the diagonals a@xmath1 and b@xmath2 two congruent triangles a@xmath2@xmath1 and b@xmath1@xmath2 are formed , we prove this equality easily using the side , angle , side ( sas ) postulate .",

    "this new quadrilateral has as above , the angles a@xmath2@xmath1 and e@xmath1@xmath2 right angles , but its opposite sides a@xmath2 and e@xmath1 are not equal now , that is , a@xmath2 @xmath3 e@xmath1 .",
    "since the angle ae@xmath1 , as an exterior angle of the triangle abe , is greater in measure than the interior remote angle abe , the angles abe and @xmath2ab are equal , and the angle @xmath2ab is greater in measure than the angle @xmath2ae , it follows that the angle ae@xmath1 @xmath3 @xmath2ae .",

    "[ [ proof-2 ] ] proof : + + + + + +    since the side ab of the triangle ab@xmath1 is now base for the isosceles triangle a@xmath2b , it will be that the line segment e@xmath2 , which joins the midpoint of the line segment ab and the vertex @xmath2 of the isosceles triangle a@xmath2b , must be perpendicular bisector to the side ab .

[ [ proof-3 ] ] proof : + + + + + +    since the side a@xmath2 of the right triangle ab@xmath2 , is shorter in length than the side b@xmath2 , it results that the angle @xmath2ab is greater in measure than the angle ab@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore by the equivalence of the plane separation postulate and paschs postulate [ 6 ] it follows that the perpendicular bisector @xmath5 t except with the side ab has to intersect and an other side of the triangle ab@xmath2 . we suppose that the perpendicular bisector @xmath5 t to the side ab of the triangle ab@xmath2 also intersects and the side a@xmath2 of the above triangle at a point m , since every point on the perpendicular bisector @xmath5 t is equidistant from the endpoints of the line segment ab , it must be that the sides am = mb and the angles bam and abm are equal , but this is impossible since the angle bam = ba@xmath2 is greater in measure than the angle ab@xmath2 and angle ab@xmath2 is greater in measure than the angle abm .",
