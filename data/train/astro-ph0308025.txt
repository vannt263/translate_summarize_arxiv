    "the interpretation of blazars tev spectra is at present affected by a fundamental ambiguity , due to the absorption of high energy photons by the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) through @xmath0-@xmath0   collision and pair production .",
    "the still large uncertainties on ebl knowledge prevent a reliable reconstruction of the intrinsic source spectrum , while conversely data from the synchrotron peak alone are not sufficient to univocally constrain the high energy peak of the blazars spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , thus hindering the possibility to disentangle absorption from intrinsic features . until more and better data are available , two possible lines of study are : 1 ) to assume a  best estimate \" for the ebl and then to study the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum in the context of blazars emission models ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; or 2 ) to make simple ,  reasonable \" assumptions on the shapes of the intrinsic tev spectra ( according to our present blazar knowledge ) , and then to limit the range of possible ebl fluxes ( and spectral shapes ) compatible with them .",
    "this second approach becomes more constraining as more sources are available , since the ebl must be the same for all and how much an incident spectrum is deformed depends strongly on redshift .",
    "with the recent results on 1es 1426 + 428 @xcite and 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite , we have now 4 objects with measured tev spectra ( see fig . 1 ) and at 3 very different redshifts ( @xmath10.03 , 0.047 , 0.129 ) , thus allowing to draw multiple constraints . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on this second approach , and present the first preliminary results on the ebl sed obtained considering the effects on all 4 tev sources at the same time .",
    "fig . 1 and 2 show different ebl shapes ( obtained simply by connecting flux values at fixed frequencies ) and the corresponding effects on the absorption  corrected tev spectra .",
    "the compilation of measurements and lower limits have been taken from @xcite , updated with the most recent publications ( ref . in @xcite ) .",
    "for the blazar spectra , we have used the hegra data @xcite completed at low energy by the cat and whipple results for 1es 1426 + 428 @xcite and 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite . in calculating the optical depths , we have assumed no model for ebl evolution , but only the changes in energy and photon density due to cosmology . for the latter , we adopted the recent w - map results , namely : h@xmath2 km / s / mpc , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our main assumptions for a  reasonable \" blazar tev spectrum have been : a smooth ( power - law or curved ) continuum , with no sharp features as up - turns or strong breaks , and a spectral index @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) not too hard , i.e. possibly @xmath7 , which is the hardest value expected from an electron distribution cooled by synchrotron or inverse compton mechanisms .",
    "1 ( left ) show the results with an ebl shape designed to match the reported ebl measurements , in particular the high points at 1 - 3 @xmath8 m @xcite , and the first estimates at 60 @xmath8 m @xcite .",
    "this gives origin to a sharp up - turn in the mkn 501 and mkn 421 spectra , and to an extremely hard spectrum up to @xmath11 tev for 1es 1959 + 650 and 1es 1426 + 428 ( @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 ) , with a sharp break for the latter . to avoid these effects",
    ", it is necessary to lower the ebl flux in the range 30 - 80 @xmath8 m ( to avoid the up - turns in the two markarians , fig . 1 right ) and in the range 1 - 3 @xmath8 m ( to reduce the hardening of the low energy spectra , fig .",
    "note also that the slope between 2 and 10 @xmath8 m should be around ( or steeper than ) @xmath11 , otherwise the flattening of the observed 1es 1426 + 428 spectrum above 2 tev would imply again a sharp up - turn and very hard slope for the intrinsic one @xcite .    with an ebl sed given in fig .",
    "2 ( left ) , which is similar to some model predictions @xcite , one can avoid strange shapes for the blazar intrinsic spectra , but still has to face two uncommon features : a very hard spectrum for 1es 1959 + 650 ( @xmath12 between 0.5 and @xmath12 tev ) and the overall sed of 1es 1426 + 428 , whose tev spectrum would imply a high energy peak at or above @xmath18 tev with a compton dominance @xmath13 , unexpected in this class of objects @xcite . to avoid this ,",
    "the ebl fluxes should be of even lower intensity below @xmath13 @xmath8 m , approaching the lower limits given by the hst counts @xcite . with a shape as given in fig .",
    "2 ( right ) , the intrinsic 1es 1959 + 650 spectrum would have a low energy slope around @xmath140.5 , and 1es 1426 + 428 would be characterized by a lower ( more usual ) compton dominance ( @xmath15@xmath1@xmath16 ) with a tev spectral slope similar to the x - ray one ( @xmath5@xmath10.9 , @xcite ) .",
    "these limits can be loosened a bit taking into account the residual uncertainty on the absolute flux and energy calibration of erenkov telescopes , estimated in @xmath120% and @xmath115% respectively ( i.e. systematically decreasing energy and normalization of the data points of all the 4 tev sources ) .",
    "to avoid  unreasonable \" shapes for the blazar intrinsic spectra , at least according to our present knowledge of the blazar phenomenon , the data of the 4 tev bl lacs considered together put some limits to the ebl fluxes and spectral shape , which can be roughly given as : @xmath1715 nw / m@xmath18/sr in the range 0.8 - 3 @xmath8 m , @xmath176 nw / m@xmath18/sr at 60@xmath8 m ( these values become @xmath1720 and @xmath1710 nw / m@xmath18/sr , respectively , including the systematic error ) , and with a slope around or steeper than @xmath11 between 2 and 10 @xmath8 m .",
    "conversely , if higher values or different shapes should be confirmed by more constraining data or models , this would require a deep revision of our understanding of the blazars emission mechanisms and physical conditions .",
