    "if the galaxy formed primarily through continuous merging of small dwarf systems as demanded by cold dark matter scenarios ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; klypin et al.1999 ; moore et al.1999 ; bullock , kravstov , & weinberg 2001 ; boily et al.2004 ) , possibly even until @xmath3 , then we ought to be able to trace this assembly through the ratio of the elemental abundances in stars .",
    "this is because the color - magnitude diagrams of dwarf galaxies in the local group have shown a wide variety of star formation histories and physical properties ( e.g. , grebel 1997 ; mateo 1998 ; tolstoy et al.1998 ; dolphin et al.2003 , skillman et al.2003 ) , which are expected to lead to differences in chemical evolution , as predicted by many evolution scenarios ( e.g. , lanfranchi & matteucci 2004 ; pagel & tautvaisien 1998 ) . a variety of element ratios are expected in the stars of different ages and dwarf galaxy origin .",
    "therefore , `` chemical - tagging '' ( a term from freeman & bland - hawthorn , 2002 ) of stellar populations in the galaxy should be possible if significant formation occurred through hierarchical merging .",
    "the detailed and recent stellar abundances in the smallest , dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ; shetrone et al.2001 , 2003 ; tolstoy et al.2003 ; geisler et al.2005 ) , have shown their stars tend to have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratios than similar metallicity galactic field stars .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratio is an important tracer of the relative contributions of sne ii / ia since only sne ii contribute to the production of the @xmath0 elements , whereas both contribute to iron .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is particularly sensitive to this difference at higher metallicities , when sne ia have begun to make a significant contribution to the chemical evolution of the system ; the sgr dwarf galaxy remnant is an excellent example of this , where the [ @xmath0/fe ] trend is similar to that of galactic halo stars , however offset such that it appears that sne ia have contributed significant amounts of iron at lower metallicities and [ @xmath0/fe ] is significantly subsolar by [ fe / h]=0 ( bonifacio et al.2004 ) .",
    "however some galaxies , e.g. , draco , show low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios even at the lowest metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ; shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) , which may suggest that metal - dependent outflows of sne ii ejecta are also important .",
    "many metal - poor dsph stars also show low [ y / eu ] abundance ratios , which depends on the r- and s - process contributions from sne ii and agb stars . because of the slower chemical evolution in the small dwarf galaxies , s - process enrichments from _ metal - poor _ agb stars are important and these stars have lower yields of light s - process elements , such as y ( travaglio et al.2004 ) . in dsph stars , the low y",
    "is not mimiced by low ba ( as predicted ) , which results in high [ ba / y ] ratios compared to the galactic field stars ( venn et al.2004 ) .",
    "this is most evident around metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath5 , before the more metal - rich agb stars can also contribute to the s - process yields , even dominate the total contribution which can bring the [ ba / y ] ratio , and others , into agreement with the galactic comparison stars ( e.g. , one metal - rich rgb / agb star in fornax has lower [ ba / y ] than the metal - poor rgb stars in fornax , in excellent agreement with galactic comparison field stars ) .",
    "the chemical comparisons of a large sample of galactic field stars were compared to those in the small dsph galaxies by venn et al.(2004 ) .",
    "there the stars were divided into galactic components based on their kinematics . while there is some marginal evidence that galactic halo stars with extreme retrograde orbits overlap in [ @xmath0/fe ] with the stars in dsphs , this was not evident in the [ ba / y ] ratios .",
    "thus , it appears that no significant component of the galactic halo , nor the galactic thick disk which was also examined , could have formed from the mergers of these small dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , these comparisons were based on the available detailed abundances in seven dsph galaxies , and primarily from stars in their central fields .",
    "early results from the much broader cat survey in three dsphs ( sculptor , fornax , and sextans from the dart survey ; e.g. , see tolstoy et al.2004 for sculptor ) shows that the stars in their central fields tend to have higher metallicities than most of the stars out near their tidal radii .",
    "it is possible then that these outer dsph field stars have different chemical abundance ratios , which may be more similar to the metal - poor stars in the galactic halo ; detailed abundance ratios for these outer metal - poor dsph stars are pending . aside from the selection of stars in the dsphs , the comparisons examined by venn et al.(2004 ) also did not rule out early merging , before the dwarf galaxies had a chance to have a significant and unique chemical evolution history ; merging with larger dwarf galaxies was also not ruled out .",
    "it is also interesting to note that another important physical difference between the large and small dsphs galaxies is that the larger dwarf galaxies have higher masses and contain globular clusters ( gcs ; van den bergh 2000 ) .    in this paper , we ask how do the gcs fit into this scheme ? can the gcs be used as a test of the merging history of large dwarf galaxies in the formation of our galaxy ?",
    "if some of the galactic gcs have extragalactic origins , then we may assume that they trace the merging history of the _ large _ dwarf galaxies , given that gcs are only found in the larger milky way dwarf galaxies of the magellanic clouds , sagittarius ( sgr ) , fornax , and canis major ( cma ) .",
    "we caution that the opposite is not true ; not all massive dwarf galaxies have gcs .",
    "therefore we can only say that if we find an extragalactic gc that it must have come from a more massive dwarf galaxy . presumably , differences in star formation histories , chemical evolution , and/or the initial conditions ( mass , pre - enrichment , or environmental factors ) between the various dwarf galaxies could also leave discernable chemical imprints on their gcs that might be chemically tagged when merged into our galaxy .",
    "it has been shown that the sgr gcs terzan  7 ( ter  7 ) and palomar  12 ( pal  12 ) follow the abundance trends of the sgr field stars ( e.g. , cohen 2004 ; tautvaisien et al.2004 ) .",
    "in addition , the gcs and field stars analyzed in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; hill et al.2000 ; hill 2004 ) follow the same abundance trends that have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( o , ca , and ti ; with the possible exception of mg ) than similar metallicity field stars in the galaxy , which is similar to the field stars in the small dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , the question is whether there is a population of gcs in the galaxy that have low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( and possibly other chemical signatures ) that could be interpreted as these clusters having formed in dwarf galaxies and later were captured through merging .",
    "there have been many papers that present and/or review the abundances in gcs , or compare a subset of gcs to one another and/or to galactic field stars ( most recently sneden , ivans , & fulbright 2004 ; gratton , sneden , & carretta 2004 ) . in general , the galactic gcs show amazing uniformity in their [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( plateau levels @xmath6dex ) , and they follow the abundance trends seen in the galactic field stars when plotted as a function of the [ fe / h ] values .",
    "this seems incredible in terms of understanding hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "carney ( 1996 ) showed that there is little or no relationship between [ @xmath0/fe ] and age for the gcs .",
    "given sne ia contributions lead to a decrease in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios with increasing metallicity as seen in the galactic field stars , carney argued that the lack of a similar turn - down for the gcs implies a lack of sne ia contributions to the gcs . therefore ,",
    "if the timescale of when the type  ia supernovae significantly contribute to the interstellar medium is short , the `` old '' halo and disk gcs could not share a common chemical history and one of the populations must have been later accreted .",
    "the exceptions include gcs associated with the sgr dwarf galaxy , e.g. , ter  7 and pal  12 , which have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than comparison galactic stars ( cohen 2004 ; sbordone et al.2005 ; tautvaisien et al.2004 ) , and both have younger ages than typical galatic halo gcs . also , @xmath1  centauri ( pancino et al.2002 ) and ruprecht  106 ( rup  106 ; lin & richer 1992 ; brown , wallerstein , & zucker 1997 ) show peculiar chemical abundances and are thought to be captured clusters .",
    "but when it comes to gcs , the more common questions have been related to the internal variations in cno and namgal observed in their red giant stars .",
    "these variations are attributed to a combination of initial composition differences coupled with internal mixing mechanisms ( gratton et al.2004 ) , though others have been exploring the possibilities and predictions of enrichments from early agb stars during the cluster formation process ( cottrell & da  costa 1981 ) . because these abundance anomalies are seen only in gcs and never in field stars , including in dwarf galaxy field stars , shetrone et al.(1998 , 2001 , 2003 ) concluded that the gcs can not have formed from the small dwarf galaxies , e.g. , during the merging event .",
    "however , gcs formed in large dwarf galaxies that later merged into the galactic halo and survived has not been ruled out .    in this paper , we re - examine the element ratios in as many galactic gcs as available in the literature to compare with the galactic field stars and stars in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "the goal is to indentify candidate gcs that show signatures of extragalactic origins either chemically or ideally both chemically and kinematically .",
    "while it has been found that smaller dwarf galaxies ( such as the present - day milky way dsph satellites ) have contributed little or nothing to the galactic halo ( at least from those stars as summarized in venn et al.2004 ) , the gcs should examine the contributions of larger dwarf galaxies .",
    "the field stars with detailed abundance ratios include only stars that are currently in the solar neighborhood , while the gcs sample all parts of the galaxy , including the bulge .",
    "of particular interest are the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , as well as the light r - process ratios which have been successful in separating the galactic field stars from stars in the dsphs .",
    "we study the gc abundance ratios with regards to their kinematic populations having adopted the galactocentric velocities ( @xmath7 ) from dinescu et al.(1999a , b , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 , and private communications for updates ) to separate the gcs into standard galactic components ( as discussed in  3 ) . by noting which component of the galaxy the clusters belong to",
    ", we also try to identify clusters that may have unusual abundance signatures for their kinematically assigned galactic component .",
    "detailed elemental abundances are available for 45 gcs ; 32 clusters with @xmath83 stars analyzed .",
    "these clusters are listed in table  1 , along with the number of stars analysed in each cluster and references .",
    "the literature was searched for high - resolution abundances determined within the past 20 years .",
    "the oldest analysis included here is by gratton , quarta , & ortolani ( 1986 ) for three gcs .",
    "a majority of the analyses are from the past five years .",
    "we have found that studies from older than 1990 used lower resolution spectra ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "more modern studies that use lower resolution ( 18000 or less ) include mcwilliam , geisler , & rich ( 1992 ) , mishenina , panchuck , & samus ( 2003 ) , cavallo , suntzeff , & pilachowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "we consider the abundance ratios coming from these studies as being less reliable . in most cases when abundance ratios based on higher resolution spectra are available , those from lower resolution spectra are not included in the final mean ratios .",
    "table  2 lists the elemental abundances and their standard error of the mean for select elements from mg to eu for each of the gcs in table  1 .",
    "we adopted the solar abundances and @xmath10 values used by the lick - texas group as the standard values ( solar abundances , grevesse & sauval 1998 ; @xmath10 , see table  3 in fulbright 2000 for example ) .",
    "all abundance ratios were corrected to these values ( observed - adopted ) in an effort to standardize the different datasets values were given in the published article . ] .",
    "details on the adjustments are given in  4 . in table  2",
    ", the final individual abundance ratios relative to fe ( shown in bold ) were averaged together by weighted averages according to the number of stars that were used in each study .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] and comparison ratios , e.g. [ ba / y ] , were calculated using the final weighted - mean ratios .",
    "the italicized ratios were not used in calculating the final weighted mean abundance ratios .",
    "the gcs in table  2 span a range of @xmath11 ( m15 ) @xmath12 [ fe / h ] @xmath13 ( ngc 6528 ) . in a majority of the cases , the [ fei /",
    "h ] and [ feii / h ] ratios were averaged when both were available .",
    "similarly , the [ ti / fe ] ratio is the average of the [ tii / fe ] and [ tiii / fe ] ratios when both were given for the cluster , otherwise it is the [ tii / fe ] ratio .",
    "ideally , it would be best to match ionization states when determining the ti ratios , e.g. , [ tii / fei ] and [ tiii / feii ] .",
    "however , in most cases not enough information was presented to determine these values .",
    "many papers give the final abundances [ tii / fe ] and [ tiii / fe ] with no clear explanation how [ fei / h ] and [ feii / h ] were averaged together to determine [ fe / h ] . as a result",
    ", we used the mean [ fe / h ] ratio when determining the ti ratios .",
    "our selection of elements was based on those determined regularly in gc stars , and those that have been useful in the analysis of stars in dsph galaxies .",
    "variations in cno , na , mg , and al are regularly found in clusters from star - to - star , and are usually attributed to mixing with cno - cycled gas ( e.g. , kraft 1994 ; sneden 2000 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ; sneden et al.2004 ; gratton et al.2004 ) .",
    "we have avoided these elements in this paper ( with the exception of magnesiummg@xmath14  dex ( see discussion in  5.1 ) ] given its relevance as a true @xmath0 element indicator ) because we are primarily concerned with global signatures of galaxy formation and not stellar or chemical evolution within gcs .    for abundances in galactic field stars",
    ", we have adopted those in table  2 in venn et al.(2004 ; see references therein ) .",
    "the abundances in seven dsph galaxies are from shetrone et al.(2001 , 2003 ) and geisler et al.(2005 ) .",
    "stellar abundances for 26 stars in the sgr dwarf galaxy remnant have also been added from bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2000 ; 2004 ) and smecker - hane & mcwilliam ( 2005 ) .",
    "we have determined the galactic stellar population component for 29 gcs based on a calculation of their phase space .",
    "phase space distribution functions have been determined using the galactocentric velocity vector components ( v(@xmath7 ) in kms@xmath15 ) from dinescu et al.(1999ab , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 , and private communications for updates ) and the galactocentric positional vector components ( r(x , y , z ) in kpc ; harris 1996 ) .",
    "firstly , we computed the probability for a gc to be associated with the galactic thin disk , thick disk , or halo from its velocity vector using a standard bayesian classification scheme and galactic gaussian velocity ellipsoid components from dehnen & binney ( 1998 ; thin disk ) , soubiran , bienaym , & siebert ( 2003 ; thick disk ) , and chiba & beers ( 2000 ; halo ) .",
    "this method is the same as was used for the galactic field stars by venn et al.(2004 ) .",
    "secondly , the probability for a gcs to be associated with these galactic components was determined from its positional vector . for this , a standard galactic model ( robin , reyle , derrire , & picaud 2003 ) was chosen with a maximum halo extent of r = 150 kpc , a softening parameter @xmath16=1.0 ( which is used to stop the density of the halo from going to infinite at the galactic center ) , and adopting an asympotitic r@xmath17 halo profile .",
    "this was not necessary for the galactic field stars studied by venn et al.(2004 ) since it is a good assumption that those stars are in the solar neighbourhood quadrant .",
    "the kinematic and positional probabilities were combined for a phase space determination of the final probabilities for each gc to be associated with each galactic component .",
    "finally , we allocated any gcs within r = 2.7 kpc of the galactic center to a bulge component unless the kinematics placed it in another component , and did not probe more deeply into variations between bulge gcs and/or those associated with a bar ( e.g. , dinescu et al.2003 ) .    table  3 lists the velocity and positional vector components for each gc , as well as which galactic component they belong to .",
    "we have also added kinematic information for m54 and ter  7 which are embedded in the sgr dwarf galaxy remnant ; thus , on the assumption that these clusters are associated with the sgr remnant , then we have adopted the known kinematics for sgr ( ibata et al.1997 ) as a reasonable approximation to their @xmath7 velocities .",
    "this allows us to highlight these clusters in our abundance ratios and kinematic analyses .",
    "rup  106 is another cluster that does not have kinematic information , however it has a large galactocentric radial velocity ( @xmath18 kms@xmath15 ; harris 1996 ) . adopting a plausible range of proper motions ( 0``,@xmath191 '' in ra and dec )",
    ", we investigate its potential space velocities ( @xmath20 and @xmath7 ) . in all cases , the galactocentric radial velocity , @xmath21 , is quite large ( @xmath22 to @xmath23 kms@xmath15 ; see table  4 ) implying rup  106 is a member of the galactic halo , possibly on a plunging orbit that would be consistent with a captured cluster . the final column in table  3 lists the gc classifications from ( mackey & gilmore 2004 ) which are based on the physical properties of gcs . while overall there is good agreement between the two classifications ,",
    "there are some key differences especially for the clusters which have thick disk kinematics , while according to mackey & gilmore they have halo - like properties .",
    "a toomre diagram for the gcs is shown in figure  1 , where the galactocentric rotational velocity @xmath24 is plotted against @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . to be consistent with the field stars examined by venn et al.(2004 ) , we plot the gcs as colored points according to the assigned galactic component ( e.g. , cyan = halo , green = thick disk , red = thin disk ) .",
    "gcs assigned to the bulge are not shown in fig .  1 .",
    "only three clusters stand out in this diagram ; pal  12 has thin disk kinematics however its positional vector places it in the halo ( thus cyan colored gc amongst the thin disk field stars ) , m68 which has an unusually high galactocentric rotational velocity ( @xmath27 kms@xmath15 ) , and m22 is a thick disk cluster with an unusually high @xmath25 component ( + 212 kms@xmath15 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the distribution in [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.  @xmath24 for the gcs compared with the field stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "venn et al.(2004 ) commented on the large and overlapping distribution in these abundances for the field stars in each of the galactic components .",
    "for the [ @xmath0/fe ] plot , we have averaged the mean abundances of ca and ti per gc ( note that this differs slightly from the field star analysis by venn et al.2004 where [ @xmath0/fe ] represented an average of mg , ca , and ti ) .",
    "the most outstanding gcs are pal  12 and rup  106 , with very low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios .",
    "of course , pal  12 is associated with the sgr dwarf galaxy remnant and rup  106 is thought to have been captured possibly from the magellanic clouds ( lin & richer 1992 ) . for the thick disk clusters ,",
    "it is interesting to see that they are clustered both toward lower [ fe / h ] and higher [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "although they are within the range of the thick disk field stars , the thick disk gcs do not show as wide of a spread in metallicity . in any case , we conclude that the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios from the gcs in each kinematic component are in good to excellent agreement with those of the field stars in the same galactic component .",
    "most of the data on gc stellar abundances comes from the lick - texas group .",
    "therefore we have adopted the solar abundances they used ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , along with their @xmath10 values ( see table  3 of fulbright 2000 for references ) , as the fiducial standards on which all abundances are adjusted .",
    "differences in solar abundances and @xmath10 are in the sense of the value from the reference paper minus our adopted values .",
    "a number of clusters were not corrected because either their solar abundances and @xmath10 values matched the adopted ones ( no adjustments were made for differences of less than about 0.04  dex ) or no values were given .",
    "these gcs were noted in table  1 . in the following",
    "we note each cluster where adjustments were made to the abundance ratios .",

    "the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio for pal  12 have been discussed ( cohen 2004 ) ; combined with its kinematics ( dinescu et al.2000 ) , this provides compelling evidence that this cluster was formed in the sgr dwarf galaxy before merging with the galaxy .",

    "the lower star formation efficiencies in dwarf galaxies ( tolstoy et al.2003 ; lanfranchi & matteucci 2004 ; pagel & tautvaisiene 1998 ) mean that metals build up more slowly _ with time _ than in the galaxy ,",
    "and thus we might expect more contributions from metal - poor stars ( e.g. , metal - poor agb stars ) at a given time or metallicity .",
    "coupled with the fact that stellar yields are thought to be metallicity dependent , then the s- and r - process ratios in stars in dwarf galaxies may be different from comparable metallicity stars in the galaxy .",
    "venn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that metal - poor stars in dsph galaxies often have lower [ y / eu ] and higher [ ba / y ] ratios than similar stars in the galaxy , consistent with metallicity dependent yields by travaglio et al.(2004 ) .",
    "thus , the neutron capture element ratios offer another tool to distinguish variations in the dsph abundance ratios compared with the field star population and possibly the gcs .    in figure  5 ,",
    "the ratios of [ eu / fe ] , [ y / eu ] , and [ laba / eu ] ( an average of la and ba , which have similar nucleosynthetic histories and s - process contributions in the solar system ) are shown .",
    "the eu abundance primarily samples the pure r - process contributions at all metallicities ( its r - process in the sun is 97% ; burris et al.2000 ) . comparing the [ eu / fe ] ratios ( fig",
    ".  5 , upper panel ) to the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( fig .  4 , upper panel )",
    ", they follow similar trends as the field stars as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "this agrees with the idea that @xmath0-elements and eu derive from the same environment ( sne  ii s ) . to examine the s - process and r - process contributions separately , we examine y ( its s - process in the sun is 74% ; travaglio et al.2004 ) , la ( its s - process in the sun is 75% ; burris et al.2000 ) and ba ( its s - process in the sun is 81% ; arlandini et al.1999 ) relative to eu .",
    "y versus la and ba are important because they sample different peaks in the neutron magic numbers .",
    "y ( z=39 ) belongs to the first peak that builds through rapid captures around neutron magic number n=50 .",
    "la ( z=57 ) and ba ( z=56 ) belong to the second peak that builds around n=82 .    in the most metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath76 ) , the observed variations in [ eu / fe ] in both the galactic field stars and gcs has been interpreted as variations in the r - process contributions , probably due to inhomogeneous mixing due to the location of the forming gc relative to a sne ii event ( possibly even a sne ii event from the formation of the gc itself ) in the early chemical evolution of the galaxy ( mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "the [ y / eu ] and [ laba / eu ] ratios are in excellent agreement with the galactic field stars , suggesting similar r - process contributions of these elements to gcs and field stars at low metallicities plus no s - process contributions . around",
    "[ fe / h]@xmath77 , the [ laba / eu ] ratio are noticably above the pure @xmath78-process level ( [ ba / eu]@xmath79 ; burris et al.2000 ) .",
    "johnson & bolte ( 2001 ) argued that this rise may be due to problems with the analysis of the strong ba ii 4554  line and not due to @xmath80-process contributions .",
    "at intermediate metallicities , @xmath81 [ fe / h ] @xmath82 , m80 has a slightly high value of [ eu / fe ] , and rup  106 has a slightly low ratio , though rup  106 is within the range of the halo field stars .",
    "given that the m80 data comes from a large sample of stars from a recent study , this result likely means m80 was contaminated by higher mass sne ii events .",
    "m4 has a slightly elevated [ laba / eu ] ratio .",
    "this is likely to be related to a slightly larger agb s - process contribution than the other gcs , however it is not outside the range of the galactic field stars .",
    "ivans et al.(1999 ) also noted that m4 has slightly higher [ ba / fe ] and [ la / fe ] ratios compared to other galactic gcs , and commented `` that the high ba and la properties of m4 stars is surely a primordial , not an evolutionary , effect . ''    among the metal - rich stars and clusters , [ fe / h ] @xmath83 , the two gcs associated with the sgr remnant , pal  12 and ter  7 , stand out with slightly high values of [ eu / fe ] relative to thick and thin disk stars .",
    "the [ y / eu ] ratio in pal  12 is very low though ; this may suggest a lack of s - process contributions from agb stars , however [ laba / eu ] is not lacking , and therefore the [ ba / y ] ratio in pal  12 is remarkably high in figure  6 , where we compare the gcs , field stars , and dsph field stars .",
    "this is consistent with the [ y / eu ] and [ ba / y ] ratios seen in the dsph field stars ( shetrone et al.2003 ; venn et al.2004 ) , and interpreted in terms of more significant contributions from _ metal - poor _ agb stars in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "metallicity dependent yields from agb stars ( travaglio et al . 1999 , 2004 ) suggest that the first - peak r - process elements ( including y , sr , and zr ) are by - passed in favor of second - peak elements ( including ba and la ; and third peak elements as well , but these are not observable in red giant spectra ) in metal - poor stars , due to an excess of neutrons available for capture per seed nucleus .",
    "finally , we noted that in the dsph galaxies , a third of the dsph field stars with @xmath72 } < -1.8 $ ] show a clear offset in the [ ba / y ] ratios relative to the galactic field stars ( venn et al.2004 ) .",
    "the metal - poor galactic gcs do not clearly show the same neutron capture element ratios as in the low mass dsph field stars ( see middle panel of fig .",
    "it is interesting that comparing the halo and thick disk clusters , the halo gcs are offset more toward higher [ ba / y ] similar to dsph field stars .",
    "given that gcs are thought to be the first objects to form in a galaxy , it is very important to determine their true ages .",
    "however , this has been a very challenging task ( see review by sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ) .",
    "while the relative ages between gcs is an easier property to measure , different methods have yielded different absolute ages for the gcs ( e.g. , salaris & weiss 2002 ) .    for our purposes , we do not need the absolute ages of the gcs in our sample to be the true ages of the gcs .",
    "given that the wmap results ( spergel et al . 2003 ) find the age of the universe as @xmath84  gyr , most of the absolute gc ages in the literature are too old .",
    "here , we only investigate whether the gcs show any interesting properties or trends in relative age . in figure  7 , we show age as a function of [ fe / h ] , where the ages have been determined by vandenberg ( 2000 ) and salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) .",
    "although rosenberg et al.(1999 ) have a sample of relative gc ages , we chose to use the more recent results of salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) which also includes a larger number of gcs .",
    "vandenberg used stellar evolution models which take into account the @xmath0 element abundance to measure the @xmath85 magnitude difference between the horizontal branch and the main - sequence turn - off ( @xmath86 ) for the gcs .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio was assumed to either be 0.3 or 0.0 .",
    "we contrast these `` @xmath0 enhanced '' isochrone ages with those from salaris & weiss , who divide the gcs into four groups according to their metallicities then assign ages for a reference cluster within each group using @xmath87 .",
    "the ages for the remaining gcs in each group are then found using isochrones ( assuming [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath88 ) to determine the color difference between the main sequence turn - off and the red giant branch .",
    "of the 45 gcs in our database , 17 and 32 have ages from the vandenberg and salaris & weiss studies , respectively .",
    "we have not searched the literature to find absolute ages for the remaining gcs in our sample because of the difficulties in normalizing those ages to these two studies .    comparing the age vs.  metallicity diagrams in fig .  7",
    ", both studies show a trend of decreasing age with increasing metallicity .",
    "the most metal - poor thick disk gcs have ages similar to those found in the halo .",
    "the thin disk clusters show a younger age consistent with the idea that the thin disk formed after the halo .",
    "both methods yield the same ( old ) age for the more metal - poor gcs .",
    "the metal - rich gcs associated with the sgr remnant , pal  12 and ter  7 , are significantly younger than the galactic gcs , regardless of the differences in [ @xmath0/fe ] adopted between the two studies ; i.e. , vandenberg ( 2000 ) adopted [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath89 and salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) used [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath88 .",
    "we note that m68 , which is amongst the most metal - poor gcs , appears to be slightly younger ( 0.5 to 1 gyr ) than the others .",
    "whether or not this difference is significant will be discussed in  7.6 .",
    "thus , both methods yield broadly similar results for the relative ages of the gcs , however rup  106 is a good example of the difference between the two methods ; salaris & weiss find that it is younger than the majority of galactic gcs , whereas vandenberg finds that it is not much different in age than the other intermediate metallicity gcs .",
    "an updated study of relative gc ages by de  angeli et al.(2005 ) has also found there there is a trend of decreasing age with increasing metallicity .",
    "the metal - poor gcs ( [ fe / h]@xmath90 ) are shown to be old and coeval with the exceptions of m68 and m15 .",
    "de  angeli et al.found that intermediate metallicity gcs are typically younger than the metal - poor clusters , but there is a significant spread in the ages for these clusters . while there does appear to be a metallicity - age trend , there does not appear to be a @xmath0-age trend as first noted by carney ( 1996 ) . if we exclude the extragalactic gcs rup  106 , pal  12 , and ter  7 from fig .",
    "4 , there is very little scatter among the gcs in [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that there is no trend of [ @xmath0/fe ] with age from the existing data .",
    "given the relatively small numbers of metal - rich gcs with abundance ratios , more observations of these types of clusters should be done before firm conclusions can be drawn about any possible @xmath0-age relation .",
    "ngc  362 is shown to have a younger age than typical halo gc by salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) .",
    "this reaffirms the previous finding that ngc  362 is younger than its second - parameter pair cluster ngc  288 ( catelan et al.2001 ) .",
    "when the horizontal branch of a gc is redder or bluer than expected for its metallicity , a `` second - parameter '' is thought to be affecting its morphology . while it is now thought that there are many different parameters that may affect the horizontal branch morphology , age is considered the most common parameter ( e.g. , fusi pecci & bellazzini 1997 ) , as appears to be the case for ngc  362 .",
    "we make note of this because even though it has a younger age , we see no peculiarities in the abundance ratios of this gc .",
    "we want to clarify that although we discuss the difference in ages between the clusters , we do not attempt to break the gcs into `` old '' or `` young '' halo groups . zinn ( 1993 , 1996 ) looked at the properties of globular clusters and separated them into `` young '' and `` old '' halo and thick disk components based on the metallicity of the cluster and its horizontal branch morphology .",
    "mackey & gilmore ( 2004 ) have updated zinn s study to include the most recent measurements for galactic gcs and their own measurements of extragalactic gcs , separating them into bulge / disk , `` young '' halo , and `` old '' halo components . in column ( 9 ) of table  3 we list the mackey & gilmore classifications for the gcs in our sample .",
    "mackey & gilmore also used the salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) ages to discuss which gcs are truly young or old .",
    "although some of their `` young '' gcs have similar ages to the oldest clusters and some `` old '' gcs have relatively young ages , mackey & gilmore classified the gcs solely on their [ fe / h ] values and horizontal branch morphologies .",
    "we chose not to use this classification scheme because there may be other parameters beyond metallicity and age affecting a cluster s horizontal branch morphology and as a result its classification in zinn s scheme .",
    "several gcs have been associated kinematically with the sgr dwarf galaxy merger remnant , including ter  7 , ter  8 , m54 , and arp  2 ( ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1994 ) , and pal  12 ( irwin 1999 ; dinescu et al.2000 ) .",

    "m54 and ngc  2419 show no distinctive abundance ratios from the galactic field stars , with the possible exception that ngc  2419 has a slightly lower [ ca / fe ] than seen in the field . however , that is based on only one star ( shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) .",
    "smecker - hane & mcwilliam ( 2005 ) found that their three metal - poor sgr field stars have similar [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratios as stars in the galactic halo , although bonifacio et al.(2004 ) suggest that their metal - poor stars may belong to m54 .",
    "unfortunately , the m54 analysis is based on only five stars studied by brown , wallerstein , & gonzalez ( 1999 ) and at least one of the smecker - hane & mcwilliam ( 2005 ) sgr stars does have the same metallicity and [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio as m54 .",
    "furthermore , layden & sarajedini ( 1995 ) suggest that m54 may have a significant metallicity spread due to the dispersion in the red giant branch .",

    "both clusters have noticably younger ages than other galactic gc . if these clusters were not already associated with the sgr remnant , their properties ( abundance ratios , kinematics , and ages ) would set them apart from the other galactic gcs as other studies have found ( e.g. , tautvaisien et al.2004 ; cohen 2004 ; sbordone et al.2005 ) .",

    "neither of these gcs stands out in a significant way in fig .  3 and fig .  4 , although , as seen in table  1 , the data for these two clusters is sparce and from older studies .",
    "m79 does have a slightly lower [ si / fe ] ratio , but the remaining @xmath0-element ratios are consistent with field stars of similar metallicity .",

    "of the gcs associated with a prograde orbit , only ngc  6205 ( m13 ) , ngc  7078 ( m15 ) , ngc  6341 ( m92 ) , ngc  4590 ( m68 ) , and rup  106 are included in our survey . of these gcs , only m68 and rup  106 stand out .",
    "rup  106 is discussed in  7.3 , since it is thought to actually have been captured from the magellanic clouds .",
    "the properties of m68 and its possible membership to the cma dwarf are discussed further in  7.6 .",
    "rup  106 has long been noted as an interesting cluster given that the metallicity from its red giant branch does not match the metallicity from the stellar abundances .",
    "for example , brown , wallerstein , & zucker ( 1997 ) found [ fe / h]=@xmath910.10 ( for our study we use [ fe / h]@xmath92 , which is an average of [ fei / h ] and [ feii / h ] ) from spectra of two stars , while buonanno et al.(1990 ) found @xmath72}=-1.9\\pm0.2 $ ] from the red giant branch .",
    "buonanno et al . also found that rup  106 has a younger age than the typical halo gc ( see fig .",
    "lin & richer ( 1992 ) speculated that rup  106 was acquired by our galaxy from the magellanic clouds based on its position and assorted other odd properties for an outer halo cluster ( young age , high number of blue stragglers , and horizontal branch morphology ) rup  106 has a radial velocity of @xmath93 kms@xmath15(harris 1996 ) , but no other kinematics exist .",
    "as discussed in  3 , we examine potential orbits for rup  106 from reasonable limits on its ( undetected ) proper motion to find that it has either a typical halo orbit or a plunging orbit .",
    "the @xmath0-element ratios for rup  106 are significantly lower than the galactic field stars of similar metallicity , which is similar to the stars in the dsph galaxies ( see figs .  3 and 4 ) .",
    "we also notice that [ eu / fe ] is lower than in most of the gcs and galactic field stars ( see fig .  5 ) , also suggesting that rup  106 has had less sne  ii r - process contributions .",
    "if rup  106 had its origin in the magellanic clouds , then we can compare its abundance ratios with other lmc gcs .",
    "hill et al.(2000 ) and hill ( 2004 ) found that the lmc gcs have [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ratios below what is seen in the galactic halo stars at all metallicities .",
    "rup  106 falls near these lmc gcs abundances , but typically with abundance ratios about 0.1  dex lower .",
    "johnson et al.(2004 ) also determined the abundance ratios for three old lmc gcs .",
    "they find the [ ca / fe ] ratio for hodge  11 to be similar to the galactic field stars , which is much higher than the other two lmc gcs in their sample and those in the hill study .",
    "the [ ti / fe ] ratios are similar in both studies . while the abundance ratios in rup  106 do not match precisely with the analysed gcs , the tendancy towards lower [ @xmath0/fe ] is more consistent with the lmc clusters and dsph field stars .",
    "as noted in  3 , we classified anything within @xmath94  kpc to be within the bulge , unless the kinematics associate the gc with a different galactic component .",
    "for example , dinescu et al.(2003 ) noted that ngc  6528 and ngc  6553 are confined to the bulge region , and suggest that ngc  6528 is actually a `` genuine milky way bar cluster . ''",
    "although ngc  6553 is within our bulge limit , its kinematics show it has a circular orbit and therefore it is classified as a thin disk cluster .    from our model ,",
    "we classify nine clusters as belonging to the bulge .",
    "however , only one of these clusters ( ngc  6528 ) has known phase space velocities .",
    "the bulge stars have been shown to be mostly metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath95 ; mcwilliam & rich 2004 ) . using this limit , six of the nine gcs fall in this range with ter  4 being right at this limit .",
    "the three clusters ngc  6287 , ngc  6293 , and ngc  6541 are more metal - poor than this ( [ fe / h]@xmath96 ) and may not be truly associated with the bulge .",
    "the bulge stars are known to show elevated [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios compared to the metal - rich thin disk stars ( mcwilliam & rich 2004 ; fulbright , rich , & mcwilliam 2004 ) . in general , the bulge gcs show a similar trend , but not as clear as seen in the bulge field stars .",
    "of the @xmath0 elements , [ ca / fe ] shows the clearest difference between the bulge gcs and the thin disk stars .",
    "this is somewhat contrary to the bulge field stars .",
    "they have been found to be more enhanced compared to metal - rich thin disk stars in [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] than [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ( mcwilliam & rich 2004 ) .",
    "mcwilliam & rich suggested that this implied sne ii played a greater role in the bulge than in the thin disk .",
    "as noted in  3 , it is interesting to see the majority of thick disk gcs clustered toward the metal - poor range of the thick disk field stars .",
    "of the ten thick disk clusters , seven have @xmath7 velocities , which makes their classifications more certain since it is based on phase space sampling ( not just physical location ) .",
    "as discussed in  6 , the metal - poor thick disk gcs have similar ages to halo clusters , while the two metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath97 ) gcs show a younger age ( see fig .",
    "the implication is that when discussing the formation of the thick disk , it must be taken into account that the metal - poor thick disk gcs formed early on and with similar abundance ratios as the metal - poor thick disk field stars .",
    "thus , the metal - poor thick disk represents the transitional phase between the halo and thick disk formation as the galaxy collapsed according to the eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ) model of galaxy formation . examining the m31 gcs , morrison et al.(2004 )",
    "found that 40% have disk kinematics and are metal - poor ( with no age estimates ) , which is similar to our findings .",
    "contrary to this , a recent study by mould ( 2005 ) found that the thick disks in four edge - on galaxies are old and relatively _ metal - rich_. this suggests that thick disks form relatively early on and from gas - rich mergers ( dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ; brook et al.2005 ) .",
    "further studies of the galactic thick disk field stars and gcs need to be done in order to resolve the formation of the thick disk .",
    "_ ngc  4590 ( m68 ) : _",
    "m68 stands out from the majority of the galactic gcs , primarily due to its high galactocentric rotational velocity ( @xmath98 kms@xmath15 ) . as noted by lee , carney , & habgood ( 2004 )",
    ", m68 also has some interesting abundance ratios . as seen in fig .  3 , the [ ti / fe ] ratio is lower than other gcs and field stars of similar metallicites . on the other hand , the [ si / fe ]",
    "ratio in m68 is unusually high .",
    "m68 is also interesting because its horizontal branch is notably redder than expected for a gc of its metallicity ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "this is an example of the second - parameter effect as discussed in  6 . as shown in fig .",
    "7 , m68 is thought to have a slightly younger age ( @xmath99 gyr , vandenberg 2000 ; see also de  angeli et al.2005 ) compared to the typical halo gc ( @xmath100 gyr ) .",
    "this age difference is not large enough to seriously affect the horizontal branch morpology though according to theoretical models ( e.g. , catelan & de freitas pacheco 1993 ; lee , lee , & gibson 2002 ) , and argues that age alone can not be the sole parameter affecting the horizontal branch in m68 .",
    "given the slightly younger age of m68 , its high rotational velocity , and its unique [ si / ti ] ratio , we argue that it is a candidate extragalactic gc .",
    "martin et al.(2004 ) included m68 as a possible cma dwarf cluster .",

    "in addition , pancino ( 2004 ) presented the preliminary [ ca / fe ] results of about 700 red giants in @xmath1  cen which illustrated the  turn \" toward lower [ ca / fe ] for the metal - rich stars .",

    "the detection of extragalactic metal - rich gcs seems relatively easy ( e.g. , pal  12 and ter  7 ) because the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios are clearly distinctive .",
    "the influence of type ia sn occuring ( presumably ) at a lower metallicity in the chemical evolution of a dwarf galaxy causes the  turn \" towards lower [ @xmath0/fe ] at lower metallicities than in the galactic field stars leading to clear differences between their stellar populations .",
    "mackey & gilmore ( 2004 ) analyzed the physical properties of gcs in the milky way and its dwarf companions to allow a comparison between their gc systems .",
    "they divided up the galactic gcs according to their metallicities and horizontal branch morphologies into bulge / disk , `` young '' halo , and `` old '' halo components , which we list in column ( 9 ) of table  3 .",
    "overall , our classifications match up well with those from mackey & gilmore with the exception of a few cases where the kinematics tend to place a cluster in the thick disk while they classify it as belonging to the halo .",
    "mackey & gilmore concluded that all of the `` young '' halo clusters and a small fraction ( 15 - 17% ) of `` old '' halo clusters have been captured from merged dwarf galaxies , which does not include the sgr gcs .",

    ", we compare the [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ ba / y ] ratios for the `` old '' and `` young '' halo gcs as classified by mackey & gilmore .",
    "although the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in `` young '' halo gcs are marginally lower than the `` old '' halo gcs , the offset is not significant , with the exception of rup  106 which is thought to be a captured gc .    as noted above , the lack of noticable variations between the galactic gcs and field stars in our sample argues against a large number of accretions by dwarf galaxies with gcs . because of the noticable offsets between the dsph and galactic field stars at metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath103 and higher , for example in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( see fig .  4 ) , it should be relatively easy to pick out metal - rich extragalactic gcs .",
    "however , what about metal - poor extragalactic gcs ?",
    "can we rule out early accretions by dwarf galaxies before major chemical evolution has occured ? are there any abundance indicators , such as [ ba / y ] ( venn et al.2004 ) , that show differences for the metal - poor stars in dwarf galaxies and the galactic field stars ?",

    "however , a comparison between the thick disk and halo gcs at intermediate metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath104 ) shows that the halo clusters are more like the dsphs stars than the thick disk clusters in that the halo gcs are shifted toward higher [ ba / y ] values than the thick disk ones .    one way to resolve",
    "this problem is to examine the abundances in known extragalactic clusters such as those in the lmc , fornax , and sgr .",
    "many of these clusters have been shown to have ages similar to the galactic gcs ( e.g. , buonanno et al.1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be key to determine what similarities and , more importantly , what differences there are between metal - poor clusters and galactic field stars of similar metallicities .",
    "for example , as noted in  7.3 , hill ( 2004 ) found that the lmc gcs tend to have [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ratios that are below those of the galactic halo stars even for the metal - poor ones .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in rup  106 . for more metal - poor gcs ,",
    "the picture is less clear .",
    "before firm conclusions can be drawn , more work will need to be done on the metal - poor dwarf galaxy stars and their gcs to help determine what kind of impact early mergers may have had in the formation of our galaxy .",
    "lee & carney ( 2002 ) discussed a trend of decreasing [ si / ti ] ratios with increasing galactocentric radius ( @xmath105 ) for the `` old '' halo gcs as classified by zinn ( 1993 ) .",
    "they argued that this gradient could be explained by differences in sne ii contributions by stellar progenitors with different masses according to models by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "the models suggest that more massive stars ( @xmath106 ) yield higher amounts of silicon relative to calcium and titanium .",
    "therefore , lee & carney reasoned that the central regions of the galaxy , with a deeper gravitational potential , retained a higher amount of the more massive sne ii ejecta than the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "given our larger sample of gcs , we plot [ si / ti ] against @xmath107 in figure  9 , where the larger symbols are for gcs plotted at their apogalactic distance ( dinescu 2004 , private communications ) and the smaller ones are those at their galactocentric distance .",
    "to be consistent with the lee & carney analysis , we have plotted the clusters according to their classification in mackey & gilmore ( 2004 ) .",
    "mean errors are adopted for [ si / ti ] and @xmath107 ( the true erros for some of the individual gcs may be smaller than these ) .",
    "excluding m79 whose ratios come from an older study ( gratton & ortolani 1989 ) , there is no apparent trend of decreasing [ si / ti ] with increasing @xmath108 .    in investigating [ si / ti ]",

    "[ si / ti ] and [ si / ca ] are scattered over a wide range of values , but [ ti / ca ] remains relatively flat across all metallicities .",
    "this suggests spatial inhomogeneities where the oldest stars were likely polluted by individual sne ii events from progenitors of varying progenitor stellar masses ( a majority with @xmath106 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "those forming from the ejecta of more massive sne ii events are predicted to have higher amounts of silicon than calcium or titanium , while the calcium and titanium yields are similar over all stellar masses .",
    "shetrone ( 2004 ) found a similar trend in the dsph stars , where the [ o / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios tended to be higher than [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] for the more metal - poor dsph stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath90 ) .",
    "between [ fe / h]@xmath112 to @xmath104 , there appears to be a trend of decreasing [ si / ti ] and [ si / ca ] .",
    "this is consistent with a decrease in the ejecta of the most massive stars .",
    "all of the different populations , galactic field stars , gcs , and dsph stars , show this same effect . above [ fe / h]@xmath104 ,",
    "the relations of [ si / ti ] and [ si / ca ] are relatively flat for galactic field stars and gcs , which suggests that the galactic interstellar medium has become fully mixed in ejecta from all sne ii masses .",
    "the two gcs with clearly lower [ si / ti ] and [ si / ca ] ratios come from an older study ( ngc  4833 and m79 ; gratton & ortolani 1989 ) and should be reinvestigated .",
    "it is interesting to see that as many as one third of the stars in the dsph galaxies fall below the majority of the galactic field stars in both [ si / ti ] and [ si / ca ] .",
    "given that these same stars show no differences to the galactic field stars in [ ti / ca ] , something must be reducing the silicon abundances .",
    "that the dsph stars in the range @xmath113}<-1.6 $ ] are similar to the galactic field star and the gc abundance ratios argues against the possibility of a truncated initial mass function in the dsph galaxies ( discussed by tolstoy et al.2003 ) because the initially higher silicon yields presumably came from more massive stars as discussed above .",
    "however , a preferential outflow of ejecta from the most massive stars could lead to a reduced amount of silicon in the dsph interstellar medium .",
    "we have produced a standardized dataset of select abundance ratios for the galactic gcs .",
    "we also divided up the gcs into their respective galactic components to better compare them to the galactic field stars .",
    "in general , the galactic gcs follow the trends seen in the field stars for both the @xmath0 and neutron capture elements .",
    "therefore , the similarity in the abundance ratios over a wide range of metallicities seems to indicate that the chemical evolution of the galaxy has been similar throughout .",
    "we also find that gcs assigned to the thick disk tend to be found at the metal - poor end of the thick disk field star distribution .",
    "given the similar ages of these gcs with the metal - poor halo gcs , this seems to indicate that the metal - poor population of the thick disk formed in a manner similar to the halo , although some differences were seen in [ ba / y ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulge is a distinct component ; mcwilliam & rich ( 2004 ) and fulbright , rich , & mcwilliam ( 2004 ) found that the bulge stars tend to have enhanced @xmath0 elements compared to field stars and we confirm this tendancy for the bulge gcs as well .    from our sample ,",
    "we have found four extragalactic gc candidates : ter  7 , pal  12 , rup  106 , and m68 .",

    "m68 is interesting because of its high galactocentric rotational velocity , its slightly younger age , and its low [ ti / fe ] and high [ si / fe ] ratios .",
    "there is an interesting trend of decreasing [ si / ti ] with increasing [ fe / h ] for galactic field stars and gcs in the approximate range of @xmath113}<-1.6 $ ] .",
    "this implies that the most massive stars ( @xmath114 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) played a larger role during the initial chemical evolution of the galaxy that lead to higher yields of silicon .",
    "the dsph stars also follow this trend , yet the [ si / ti ] ratios in about one - third of the sample appear lower than in the galactic field stars .",
    "this implies that silicon has been lost in dsph galaxies , presumably by a preferential outflow of the ejecta from massive sne ii events",
