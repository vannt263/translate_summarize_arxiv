    "<S> inspired by the theory of quantum information , i use two non - hermitian random matrix models  a weighted sum of circular unitary ensembles and a product of rectangular ginibre unitary ensembles  as building blocks of three new products of random matrices which are generalizations of the bures model . </S>",
    "<S> i apply the tools of both hermitian and non - hermitian free probability to calculate the mean densities of their eigenvalues and singular values in the thermodynamic limit , along with their divergences at zero ; the results are supported by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> i pose and test conjectures concerning the relationship between the two densities ( exploiting the notion of the @xmath0-transform ) , the shape of the mean domain of the eigenvalues ( an extension of the single ring theorem ) , and the universal behavior of the mean spectral density close to the domain s borderline ( using the complementary error function ) . </S>"
