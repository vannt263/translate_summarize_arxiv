    "in @xcite it was shown that within the standard model ( sm ) complimented with three right - handed neutrinos @xmath3 with the masses smaller than the electroweak scale one can simultaneously explain both the dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite . this model dubbed as @xmath0msm represents a particular realization of the seesaw extension of the sm and is fully consistent with the current experimental data from the light neutrino sector . however , generation of the proper dark matter abundance of the sterile neutrino is not simple during the thermal evolution of the universe , and requires some amount of fine - tuning @xcite .",

    "it was advocated that the resulting lower bound is @xmath24 .",
    "below we will argue that the lower bound is quite a bit stronger which leads to a narrow window for the inflaton mass .",
    "reheating after inflation proceeds through a regime of the parametric resonance .",
    "the dynamics of the models with potentials similar to ( [ pot ] ) in the parametric resonance regime was studied _ via _ analytic methods in , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "in particular , the _ preheating _ in the model with the potential which contains only first two terms in ( [ pot ] ) have been studied in @xcite .",

    "the energy is stored in the zero ( or homogeneous ) mode of the inflaton @xmath26 , and all other modes are absent .",

    "since the amount of the energy transferred into the higgs field is practically negligible the dynamics of the inflaton field is very close to that of the pure quartic inflaton model which was analyzed numerically in @xcite . in brief , the inflaton zero mode keeps driving the exponential grows of the nonzero modes until roughly half of its energy is transferred into the inflaton particles .",

    "this introduces slight growth of @xmath18 with @xmath91 , and thus increases all bounds simultaneously , which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "in fig .  [ fig6 ] we combined the bounds on the inflaton mass we have found so far .",

    "these bounds could be evaded in models with arbitrary scalar field potentials , but the fact of the strong lower bound from reheating on the coupling between the inflaton and the higgs should remain rather universal .",
    "values of @xmath91 larger then @xmath118 ( and , therefore larger lower and upper bounds on the inflaton mass ) are also allowed as well . however , since the dynamics of the model at preheating may be strongly modified from the one we have studied in this letter it is hard for us to make any statements in that case , and we leave this for future analysis .",
