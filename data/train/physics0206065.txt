    "the most interesting aspect of this solution is the oscillatory behaviour which is strongly controlled by the non - dissipative part of the equation ( _ i.e. _ terms not depending on @xmath47 ) .",
    "the dynamic is very clear : just at @xmath2 the ions acquire a high _ time derivative _ of their poloidal velocity , imposed by @xmath72 .",
    "the velocity @xmath73 starts from zero and grows very fast to values which can be higher than those required to cancel the non - ambipolar current @xmath74",
    ". then they _ reverse _ the current and since the electrons are constrained to follow the external drive ( magnetic radial perturbation ) , the tendency of rotation reverses and so on .",
    "the decay due to the magnetic pumping appears on longer time scales and this indeed reduces the plasma rotation , without completely eliminating the oscillations . a plot , fig .",
    "( [ figguerre ] ) of this evolution is shown , on very large time scale ( useful to see the atenuation ) .",
    "the asymptotic value of the poloidal velocity is ( with our choices of initial conditions ) @xmath75 we can see that the nature of these oscillations is similar to that caused by a deviation form electric neutrality , when the frequency is the _ plasma frequency _ @xmath76 .",
    "the important effect of the of these oscillation is in the energy balance .",
    "the plasma rotation takes energy from the source of the initial magnetic perturbation and from the electron kinetic energy , since both support the radial electron current .",
    "this energy is dissipated via the collisional ion viscosity represented by the magnetic dumping .",
    "a more complex treatment of this problem should include a detailed electron dynamics , under the effect of the external magnetic perturbation ( which must be quantified ) .",
    "however , the presence of an oscillatory behaviour is still expected and suggests to take this into account when the efficiency of magnetic stochasticity - induced transport is considered ."

    "<S> if the turbulent diffusion of the electrons and ions are different one can expect that a radial electric field develops ( such that the ambipolarity is reinstored ) and that poloidal plasma spin - up can occur . </S>",
    "<S> however it has been shown that the diffusion of particles in turbulent fields is ambipolar . in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the radial fluxes generated by fluctuating fields has been considered and the rle of the ion polarization drift has been underlined . </S>",
    "<S> the radial ion flux partially cancels the radial electron flux and the ambipolarity is reestablished approximately , to the order @xmath0 , which is a very small quantity ( @xmath1 is the plasma transversal permitivity constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem has been examined in detail for instabilities having a substantial magnetic component in ref.@xcite . when the unstable modes that drive the radial transport are bounded inside plasma ( _ i.e. _ it can be assumed that there is no exchange of momentum with the region outside plasma ) the fluxes are ambipolar in average over a spatial region including several mode - resonance surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> pointwise non - zero radial currents , even reduced by the fraction @xmath0 , are able to build up charge filaments and can cause the plasma to be kelvin helmholtz unstable .    </S>",
    "<S> we return to this problem to examine a situation where the non - ambipolarity is switched on by an external source acting on the electron component . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the electrons are radially driven by a magnetic perturbation which imposes a constant radial flux starting at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ion polarization drift re - establishes the equality of the fluxes ( to order @xmath3 ) but in this particular case a stationary equilibrium can not be reached . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a radial non - zero current yields a non - zero time derivative of the radial electric field , _ i.e. _ a non - zero time derivative of the poloidal velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma would be accelerated without limit in the poloidal direction , but the torque competes with the magnetic pumping , a very effective damping mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we draw attention to the oscillatory variation of the velocity , which occurs an a scale much faster than the dissipative decay .    </S>",
    "<S> such `` events '' , consisting of sudden creation of non - ambipolar fluxes , followed by a fast plasma response in view of reinstoring the ambipolarity , can appear in a random space and time sequence and on the average can affect the plasma dynamics . to look in detail to only one event we shall adopt an `` _ _ initial value _ _ '' point of view . </S>",

    "<S> the radial electric current is switched on at @xmath2 , @xmath7 ( we note @xmath8 ) and for simplicity we shall assume that @xmath9 is constant in time and uniform in space during this single event . from the momentum conservation we find ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively the light speed and the alfven speed ) , @xmath12 </S>",

    "<S> since the time - derivative of the poloidal velocity is constant , the plasma rotates indefinitely in the poloidal direction with higher and higher velocity . </S>",
    "<S> naturally this requires the consideration of saturation mechanisms and makes desirable a time - depending investigation . </S>",
    "<S> we write in more detail the ion momentum equations on @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath15 @xmath16 ^{-1 }   \\label{vx1}\\ ] ] @xmath17 the charge conservation gives @xmath18 where @xmath19 from these relations and using eqs.([vyex]-[exvy ] ) and ( [ jxex1]-[jx1 ] ) we obtain a single equation for the poloidal ion velocity . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum permitivity , @xmath22 is the heaviside function and @xmath23    this equation contains higher time and space @xmath24 derivatives . in order to simplify the problem we assume that the externally imposed electron flux is uniform on the radial direction ( for the region of interest ) and this renders the entire model invariant to translation in @xmath4 coordinate . </S>",
