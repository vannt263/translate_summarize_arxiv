    "at present , there are only about a half - dozen o - rich supernova remnants ( snrs ) known .",
    "they represent the remains of high - mass stars ( m @xmath7 15 m@xmath8 ) and thus are especially useful for studying the elemental abundances of explosive nucleosynthesis processes in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the younger the remnant is , the more likely its properties accurately reflect true sn ejecta abundances unaffected by dilution from swept - up circumstellar and interstellar material .    currently , the youngest galactic remnant is the @xmath9 320 yr old o - rich snr cassiopeia a ( cas  a ) .",
    "however , with an estimated age of around 100 yr ( @xcite ) , the o - rich snr located in the magellanic type irregular galaxy ngc 4449 represents the youngest example of this type of remnant and is therefore an object of particular interest .",
    "the ngc 4449 snr was first identified by @xcite , who found a strong and point - like , non - thermal radio source approximately 1  north of the nucleus of this galaxy coincident with an region cataloged by @xcite .",
    "optical spectrophotometry of this source by @xcite showed two components : ( 1 ) narrow lines belonging to a conventional region , and ( 2 ) broad [ ] @xmath104959,5007 and [ ] @xmath106300,6363 line emissions which they attributed to a young snr similar to cas a.    optical and uv spectra taken by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite confirmed and extended this interpretation and yielded a rough analysis of the physical conditions in the snr and the associated region .",
    "they found optical line widths implying an expansion velocity of 3500 km s@xmath11 and emphasized the extremely low abundance of hydrogen in the ejecta .",
    "furthermore , they estimated that the total mass of oxygen in the optical was 10@xmath12 @xmath13 , some 50 times higher than the value derived for cas a @xcite , and estimate a progenitor mass @xmath5 30 @xmath13 .    using data from the _ einstein x - ray observatory _ high resolution imager",
    ", @xcite found the snr to also be highly luminous in x - rays , with l@xmath14 @xmath5 10@xmath15 erg s@xmath11 assuming a distance of 5.0 mpc . even at a smaller estimated distance of 3.9 mpc @xcite ,",
    "this snr is nearly 10 times more luminous in x - rays than cas a , the most luminous young snr in our galaxy , and several times more luminous than the bright o - rich snr n132d in the large magellanic cloud ( l@xmath14 @xmath5 6 @xmath2 10@xmath16 erg s@xmath11 ; @xcite ) .",

    "for comparison , we also show the einstein hri and rosat hri images . in previous observations ,",
    "it is clear that there is source confusion with two x - ray sources located @xmath5 10   to the southwest .",
    "however , the chandra observation does not suffer from this source confusion , and we can separate the snr from surrounding sources .",
    "we note that the position of the snr is coincident with the radio source as identified by @xcite .",
    "the data were calibrated and background subtracted using the _ chandra interactive analysis of observations _ ( ciao ) software ( version 2.2 ) along with the version 2.15 of the calibration database .",
    "a spectrum was extracted from a circle of 10 pixel radius ( @xmath5 5 ) centered on the source .",

    "a background spectrum located @xmath5 15   to the northeast of the snr was also extracted .    to help identify potential line features in the low s / n spectrum , we compared the ngc 4449 snr spectrum to those of other o - rich snrs . using the archival _ chandra _ observation ( obsid no .",

    "one can see that there is a general resemblance of the ngc 4449 snr spectrum to that of g292.0 + 1.8 in that several emission features seem to be present in both and with similar strength ( e.g. , for example , , , and emission features . ) because of this resemblance , we have used the _",

    "that is , the ngc 4449 snr spectrum hints at weaker emission relative to than that seen in g292.0 + 1.8 .      because of the spectral similarity of the ngc 4449 snr with g292.0 + 1.8 , we have employed the results of an _",
    "analysis of g292.0 + 1.8 @xcite as a starting point for estimating the x - ray emission temperature and elemental abundances for the ngc 4449 snr .",
    "the acis spectrum of the ngc 4449 snr was fit to a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model with variable abundances , corrected for galactic absorption . due to the low quality of the data ,",
    "the spectral fits were overparametrized ( @xmath30 0.6 ) .",
    "however , a weighting scheme developed by @xcite , whereby the weight for a given data channel is estimated by averaging the counts in surrounding channels , significantly improved the quality of the model fits ( @xmath30 1.1 ) .",

    "hri measurement was based on data covering a wider energy band ( @xmath36 kev ) and was modeled with a raymond - smith plasma assuming solar abundances .",
    "although the acis spectrum of the ngc 4449 snr is of low s / n , it is still possible to estimate some physical parameters of the remnant s x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "we first estimated the mass of ejecta which is currently emitting in x - rays .",
    "we began by assuming a simple geometry for the remnant s x - ray emission structure and then use a spectral model , such as our nei model , to relate the observed x - ray emissivity to the volume emission measure .",
    "given that the source is unresolved , we assumed a spherical geometry .",
    "then , adopting a remnant radius of 0.3 pc @xcite , the total volume of the emitting region is v = 3.1 @xmath2 10@xmath37 _ f _ d@xmath38 @xmath39 , where d@xmath40 is the distance to the remnant , normalized to 3.9 mpc and _ f _ is the volume filling factor .",

    "the high overabundance of oxygen is consistent with the remnant s uv and optical spectrum which is dominated by strong oxygen line emissions @xcite .",
    "x - ray and optical properties for five of the seven currently known o - rich snrs are listed in table  [ tab : orich ] . for each remnant other than the one in ngc 4449 ,",
    "unabsorbed fluxes and luminosities are listed for the energy range 0.3  2.1 kev .",
    "these values were obtained by fitting a two component thermal plasma with variable abundances to the total snr spectra @xcite .    with an x - ray luminosity of 2.4 @xmath2 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath11 ,",
    "the ngc 4449 snr is clearly the most luminous o - rich snr relative to the the four other o - rich snrs listed in table  [ tab : orich ] , which includes cas a. the origin of this high luminosity is most likely a strong shock interaction with dense local interstellar and/or circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "however , the young age of the ngc 4449 snr may also be an important factor .",
    "similar and even much higher x - ray luminosities have been seen in some historic extragalactic sne having strong csm interactions some 10 to 30 years after outburst ( e.g. , sn 1979c : 14 @xmath2 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath11 ; sn 1995n : 175 @xmath2 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath11 ; for 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "recent optical spectral line data suggest expansion velocities in the remnant as high as 6000 km s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "such velocities , when combined with an upper limit for the angular diameter of 0.6 pc from hst observations , imply an age of the snr is @xmath5 100 yr .",
    "this makes the ngc 4449 snr only about one tenth as old as g292.0 + 1.8 , n132d , or 1e 0102 - 7219 , and about a third as old as cas a , the youngest currently known galactic snr .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : orich ] the extracted ngc 4449 snr spectra compared to the o - rich snrs cas a , 1e  0102 - 7219 , and g292.0 + 1.8 .",
    "significant differences can be seen among these four snr spectra .",
    "for example , while g292.0 + 1.8 , 1e 0102 - 7219 , and the ngc 4449 snr all show emission around the 900 ev resonance forest ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4449 ] ) , this emission is nearly absent in cas a. also , 1e 0102 - 7219 is the only snr shown which exhibits obvious emission at the 574 ev line .",
    "therefore , while there is clearly a range of x - ray spectral properties within the o - rich subclass of snrs , the x - ray spectrum of the ngc 4449 snr fits within this range .    except for g292.0 + 1.8",
    ", there are large differences in the expansion velocity derived from x - rays and that derived from optical emission lines , as shown in table  [ tab : orich ] . the shock velocity estimate for the x - ray emitting gas in ngc 4449",
    "snr is 830 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this is @xmath5 15% higher than that estimated from the spectral fit of @xcite ( @xmath5 700 km s@xmath11 ) , but still many times lower than the 3500  6000 km s@xmath11 velocity measured from optical line emission @xcite .",
    "similar differences between x - ray and optical expansion velocities have been seen in other o - rich snr .",
    "optical studies of cas a indicate that the ejecta is moving at 4000  6000 km s@xmath11 .",
    "however , x - ray analyses suggest that the x - ray emitting gas has a temperature of @xmath23 3.0 @xmath2 10@xmath53 k , corresponding to a velocity of @xmath5 1900 km s@xmath11 . similarly , in n132d and 1e 0102 - 7219 the x - ray shock velocity is only about 20% that of the velocity seen from optical emission studies .",
    "the fact that the x - ray emitting gas exhibits a lower shock velocity than the optically emitting gas is not unexpected .",
    "both optical and x - ray emissions largely arise from sn ejecta interacting with the remnant s reverse shock that is generated as the snr forward shock moves through local ism / csm material .",
    "the reverse shock , traveling back toward the snr center , will naturally drive a lower velocity shock into the denser optically bright ejecta compared to the lower density , x - ray gas . the higher reverse shock velocity in the x - ray bright gas will lead to greater deceleration of the outward expanding ejecta .",
    "thus , the remnant s x - ray derived expansion will be corresponding less than that seen in the optical .",
    "an additional factor for explaining the difference between the optically derived expansion velocity and the x - ray gas velocity is that in all cases , equipartition between ion and electron temperatures has been assumed in the x - ray spectral model fits . in general",
    "the ions should have a higher temperature , since they carry the bulk of the energy in the shock .",
    "if the electrons and ions are not equilibrated , which is possible in collisionless shocks like those found in snr where equilibrium is reached via coulomb collisions , then the mean gas temperature should be more heavily weighted toward the ion temperature , implying a x - ray shock velocity closer to the shock velocity seen in optical emissions .",
    "recently , @xcite have found a very low degree of electron - ion equilibration ( @xmath54 @xmath55 0.07 ) in the sn 1006 remnant .",
    "if this sort of non - equilibrium state existed in the ngc 4449 snr , as well as many of the the other o - rich snr listed , then that might help to explain the relatively low derived x - ray shock velocities .",
    "@xcite suggested that because of its young age and prodigious luminosity , significant changes in the x - ray and optical output of the ngc 4449 sn might be observed on the timescale of just a few years .",
    "the 2001 _ chandra _ flux reported here may lend support to growing evidence for relatively rapid changes in the remnant s properties and luminosities .    for example , @xcite and @xcite observed a nearly 50% drop in the 6 cm radio flux density between 1973 and 1982 . in the optical , whereas 1978  1980 spectra taken by @xcite and @xcite found only narrow [ ] @xmath106716,6731 associated with emission from the surrounding region , recent spectra obtained in 1995 and 2002 indicate the emergence of broad [ ] @xmath106716,6731 from the sn ejecta @xcite .    in light of these results ,",
    "our x - ray flux measurement may likewise indicate changes in the remnant s x - ray flux over the last 20 years . both our 2001 _ chandra _ and the 1994 _ rosat _ estimated @xmath0 kev x - ray luminosity values are only about half of the 1979 _ einstein _",
    "@xmath56 kev measurements reported by @xcite .",
    "although the energy ranges for these flux measurements are different , the observed _ chandra _ spectrum does not suggest a significant amount of flux below 0.5 kev or above 2.1 kev . thus , while there is some uncertainty in the accuracy of comparing _",
    "einstein _ and _",
    "chandra _ derived fluxes for such a metal - rich snr , the overall percentage decrease observed is not out of line with reported changes seen in other wavelength regions .    in order to investigate further the reality of these flux changes , we have convolved our ngc 4449 snr x - ray spectrum model with the telescope response for both the _ einstein _ hri and _ rosat _ hri .",
    "this resulted in a predicted count rate which then could be directly compared to the observed _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ count rates for the snr reported in the literature .",
    "the reported _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ count rates are most likely overestimated due to source confusion from two nearby x - ray sources ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] ) . to account for this",
    ", we assumed that the two nearby sources were stable over the time period 1979  2001 .",
    "we calculated the ratio of the _ chandra _ count rates for the two sources to the _ chandra _ count rate for the snr plus the contaminating sources .",
    "this percentage was then subtracted from the observed _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ count rates to get an adjusted rate .",
    "this method assumes that the snr count rate was also stable between the different observations .",
    "finally , in order to remove telescope dependent effects , we adopted the ratio of the source - adjusted observed rate to the predicted rate .",
    "the ratio of source - adjusted observed to predicted count rate is shown in figure  [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "in essence , this plot shows the ratio of the observed count rate versus what would be observed by the same telescope in 2001 .",
    "this figure suggests that the count rate , and thus the remnant s x - ray luminosity , has dropped nearly 50% over the past 1520 years",
    ". it will be interesting to follow the remnant s x - ray evolution over the next few decades to see if this trend continues .",

    "such a decrease would not be unexpected given recent measurements made in the radio and optical suggesting that the remnant continues to undergo significant changes since it discovery in 1978 .",
