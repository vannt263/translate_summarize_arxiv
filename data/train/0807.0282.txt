    "recently we showed that large scale structure formation in the universe would be suppressed by the plasma collective effect@xcite . indeed",
    ", observational data seem to indicate that the conventional theoretical formula tends to overestimate@xcite the matter power spectrum at scales @xmath0 .",
    "it is implied that the underlying theory may have to be modified .",
    "moreover , our work@xcite is performed in the regime of newtonian limit and we expect to generalize the plasma collective effect in the general relativistic regime .    on the other hand , the cosmological perturbation theory(cpt ) is not complete in the sense that the electromagnetic interaction is absent .",
    "einstein - boltzmann equations accounting for evolution of cosmological perturbations have been explored for decades@xcite . concerning anisotropies ,",
    "the sachs - wolfe effect@xcite and silk damping@xcite were predicted just after the discovery of cmb@xcite and the approach of tightly coupled limit@xcite was perfected@xcite in 1990 s to account for the cmb spectrum .",
    "neither these studies include em fields even though tightly coupled limit approach combines photons and baryons as a cosmic plasma , nor have investigations been performed on the likeliness of plasma effects in cmb study . in parallel , the efforts on matter inhomogeneities including study on the growth and transfer functions@xcite comprise the evolution under only gravity .",
    "later modification@xcite taking baryons into account neither addressed em interactions , though it derived more accurate fitting formula to replace the pure cold dark matter bbks fitting@xcite .",
    "though the cpt as well as its predictions and description of cmb and mps do not take the em interaction into account , we expect plasma collective effects for the universe was in plasma state before decoupling and after reionization .    in the paper",
    ", we generalize the einstein - boltzmann(eb ) equations in the cpt to our maxwell - einstein - boltzmann(meb ) equations , which describe the perturbation evolution under both the gravity and em interaction . with the inclusion of plasma effects",
    "we derive not only cmb ion - acoustic oscillations but also baryon ion - acoustic oscillations .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "ii , we justify that the plasma conditions apply in the universe during pre - decoupling and post - reionization era . based on this justification ,",
    "we generalize the eb equation to the meb equation in sec.iii .",
    "the cmb and baryon ion - acoustic wave equations are then derived , respectively , in sec.iv and v. finally , we discuss the significance of plasma effects on cosmological perturbation .",
    "by saying `` the universe is in plasma state '' , we mean that relevant entities in the universe satisfy plasma conditions and hence the universe can be modelled as a plasma .",
    "as is said that a plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior@xcite , two criteria  quasineutrality and collectiveness must be fulfilled for the universe . as a perfectly uniform plasma is charge neutral and",
    "has no net electrostatic potential due to the perfect debye shielding , the inevitable thermal fluctuations of its electron density at finite temperature would , however , induce a non - vanishing residual electrostatic potential of the ion that defies the debye shielding .",
    "such a residual electric force exerts an additional pressure on ions ( baryons ) which will be incorperated into the cpt to display the ion - acoustic behavior in the meb equation in the following sections .",
    "the quasineutrality now means that the scale of interests ( i.e. the size of the universe ) is much larger than than the debye length : @xmath1 this makes the system is neutral enough so that one can take @xmath2 and not so neutral that all interesting em interactions vanish . in addition ,",
    "collective behaviors require enough particles inside the debye sphere : @xmath3    before decoupling ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the present photon temperature and number density @xmath7 and @xmath8 and redshift @xmath9 .",
    "these information renders @xmath10    after reionization , @xmath11 .",
    "as indicated observationally , the redshift of reionization @xmath12 ranges as @xmath13 @xcite and the reionization temperature @xmath14 is at least higher than @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , @xmath16    the plasma conditions are apparently satified in both pre - decoupling and post - reionization era and , therefore , our plasma treatment is applicable .",
    "before decoupling , the eb equations can be derived systematically@xcite to account for the couplings between cosmological components . the equation displaying the acoustic feature on cmb spectrum",
    "is then rendered from these coupled equation . following this systematical way ,",
    "our meb equation is deduced by introducing the em force appropriately and combining it with gravity for the boltzmann equation of baryons .",
    "the most general form of boltzmann equation is @xmath17 , \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the distribution function and @xmath19 $ ] characterizes the collision terms . in cpt , the distribution function @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath20 with energy @xmath21 and momentum @xmath22 , moving in direction @xmath23 at @xmath24 . for radiations ( relativistic species ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for matter with mass @xmath27 .",
    "since the collective behavior emerges in the eb equation for baryons and photon eb equations remain unchanged , we present only the derivation of modification for baryons . following the convention as in ref . , the lhs of the boltzmann equation is written as @xmath28 in equilibrium , the distribution function depends only on the length of the momentum , i.e. the energy @xmath29 and not on its direction @xmath30 , so its dependence on @xmath30 should emerge from perturbations and be of the order .",
    "therefore @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both first oorder terms and the last term in eq.([bol ] ) is negligible in the linear theory .",
    "choosing the conformal newtonian gauge , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the scale factor , @xmath35 the newtonian gravity and @xmath36 the space curvature , the constraint @xmath37 renders the four - momentum for baryons @xmath38   \\label{4-momen}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , with @xmath40 parametrizing the particle s path .",
    "this definition renders directly @xmath41    @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) is deduced from the geodesic equation @xmath44 this geodesic can be regarded as a variation of newton s second law describing the motion under the gravity in the form of metric perturbation . since baryons feel not only gravity but also em interaction , the geodesic equation should be modified to address the em field as well .",
    "the equation of motion under lorentz force reads@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the charge of the baryon(proton ) and @xmath47 is the em tensor with four - potential @xmath48 . + here",
    "@xmath49 , the proper time , is related to @xmath40 via the constraint of @xmath50 as @xmath51 therefore @xmath52 .",
    "+ by superposition principle , the geodesic equation is modified to address both gravity and em force @xmath53    as the christoffel symbol @xmath54 is expressed in terms of @xmath55 @xmath56 the em tensor @xmath57 , in terms of @xmath48 , is derived from the electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are electric and magnetic fields induced from the charge density fluctuation , and related with electric and magnetic potentials @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with the gradient operator @xmath65 .    evaluating eq.([lem ] ) renders the four - potential @xmath66.\\ ] ] as @xmath67 designated and @xmath68 replaced by @xmath69 , expanding eq.([geo0 ] ) renders , with eq.([10 ] ) , @xmath70 the lhs of eq.([boltzmann ] ) .",
    "the last term inside the bracket describes the new effect from perturbed electric fields ensured by the total neutrality of the universe while all others are conventional terms .",
    "@xmath61 , like @xmath35 , is of the first order itself since only its gradient counts .",
    "the absence of vector potentials results straightly from the fact that they change the momentum but the energy of charged particles .",
    "because of the @xmath30 dependence , the extra em - term makes no contribution in the zeroth moment equation , like the curvature term .",
    "it contributes in the first moment equation and renders the meb equation for baryons @xmath71 where `` @xmath72 '' denotes derivatives with respect to the conformal time and @xmath73 is the baryon - photon energy density ratio , @xmath74 the first moment of the temperature perturbation @xmath75 , and @xmath76 the optical depth .    since the perturbed electric field @xmath61 arises from the density perturbation , @xmath77 where the last equality is enforced by the adiabatic condition .",

    "the contribution to the sound speed from the em induced pressure relative to the photon pressure is easily estimated @xmath88 accordingly , the sound horizon is changed to the same order .",
    "the plasma contribution should therefore occur at scales much larger than the silk damping and is observationally negligible .",
    "after reionization , the universe is transferred to another plasma state and em interactions influence the evolution of the baryon density perturbation again . in this epoch , we study the evolution of perturbations , using newtonian gravity , as in ref . .",
    "since photons were decoupled long ago , boltzmann equation in the integral form , the fluid equation is appropriate to describe the density pertubation . with em forces included , our evolution equation for baryon perturbation is derived from plasma equations in the expanding universe @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the mass density and velocity of the baryon and @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the gravity , pressure and em - potentials the baryon suffers .",
    "the gravitational potential should account for total mass @xmath95 including baryons and the dark matter via poisson equation @xmath96 the universe is charge neutral in total so the electric field arises from the density fluctuation and is perturbative , @xmath97 .",
    "the expansion is defined by the local hubble parameter as @xmath98 perturbing and linearizing these equations render , to first order , @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes partial differentiation with respect to time @xmath101 . instead of @xmath102 ,",
    "the density contrast @xmath103 is more useful to work with .",
    "the meb equation is then extracted from these coupled equations @xmath104 under fourier transformation , our meb equation for baryons in reionization era is @xmath105 where thermodynamics leads the @xmath106-term to @xmath107    we therefore deliver the origin of our meb equation , according to which our investigation of plasma suppression was performed in ref . .",
    "the acoustic behavior is an impressive feature in the cmb spectrum and matter power spectrum .",
    "our study shows manifestly the em fields also contribute to this acoustic oscillation collectively . though the whole system is neutral in total , the nonzero temperature induced charge density fluctuations form a collective electric field which turns to be an extra portion of pressure exerting on the densithy perturbations in both cases . however , the contribution on the cmb is too small to be observed .",
    "both the order of magnitude estimation and the ion fluid equation analysis tell that the em contribution is of the same order as of the pressure from charged particles .",
    "as the adiabatic condition indicates baryon and photon density contrasts being parallel , the baryon to photon number ratio @xmath108 states that the em effect on the sound speed is @xmath109 smaller than ordinary cmb fluctuation .",
    "our generalization of the boltzmann equation proves this number by incorporating the lorentz force into the ordinary geodesic equation for baryons .",
    "though the plasma collective effect is negligibly small in cmb spectrum , it should has sizable imprints in the matter power spectrum as discussed in our work@xcite .",
