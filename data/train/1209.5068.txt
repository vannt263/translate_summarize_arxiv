    "vigorous study of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has revealed its strongly coupled nature @xcite .",
    "this novel state of matter , composed of deconfined light quarks ( up , down , and strange quarks ) and gluons , which once existed around @xmath0 to @xmath1 second after the big bang , is expected to be recreated at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been used to describe the space - time dynamics of the bulk matter in such collisions @xcite , which when compared to elliptic flow data from rhic revealed a very small shear viscosity ( @xmath2 ) to entropy density ( @xmath3 ) ratio @xmath4 - @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath6 has since become one of the most sensitive measures of strongly coupled nature of qgp .",
    "in addition to the elliptic flow of light hadrons , which is sensitive to the collective behavior and the initial geometry , other observables such as electromagnetic radiation , jets , and heavy quarks also provide valuable insights to the property of qgp . among these probes , we concentrate on the heavy quark probe of qgp .    in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , heavy quarks ( charm and bottom quarks ) are produced in initial hard partonic processes and are expected to probe the properties of qgp through their subsequent evolution in the medium .",
    "better theoretical understanding of how the interaction of heavy quarks and medium particles modifies the kinematics and dynamics of the heavy quarks inside the strongly coupled qgp fireball will allow us to utilize them as well controlled hard probes @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks have been considered to probe transport and static screening properties of the medium .",
    "momentum spectra of heavy quarks are modified due to energy loss and diffusion processes in the medium @xcite .",
    "survival of heavy quark - antiquark bound states ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , or heavy quarkonia , is expected to be sensitive to how the potential is altered by the debye screening of the color charges @xcite , although the recombination of heavy quarks into bound states might compensate the possible suppression of heavy quarkonia @xcite .",
    "experimental data suggest that all of these phenomena actually take place in heavy - ion collisions at lhc and rhic . the suppression of the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of open heavy quark observables , namely single electrons , single muons , and @xmath9 mesons , indicates a strong drag force acting on the heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "sequential suppression of @xmath10 is observed @xcite , while the recombination processes may be important for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this suggests the usefulness of the @xmath8 family as a clean thermometer of the qgp and also the necessity of knowing wave functions of charm quarks at hadronization .",
    "motivated by these phenomenological interests , theoretical computations have been performed and are under active development for the diffusion constant @xcite , heavy quark - antiquark free energy @xcite , spectral function for current correlator @xcite , and complex potential @xcite . of these , some @xcite are based on perturbation theory , some @xcite on potential non - relativistic qcd ( pnrqcd ) approach , some @xcite on lattice qcd simulation , and others @xcite on the conjecture underlying the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "recent developments in the study of these topics can be found in several review articles @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a new derivation of the dynamical _ description _ of heavy quarkonia in a thermal medium , which might also lead to a better description of the recombination process of heavy quarks . to discuss the dynamics of heavy quarkonia in the medium and recombination of heavy quarks into bound states ,",
    "a quantum description is indispensable .",
    "the most convenient framework to study such problems , namely the real - time dynamics of a quantum system interacting with a thermal environment , is that of open quantum system @xcite .",
    "presently , there exist a few publications based on this approach in similar contexts @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , analyses using a qcd version of the quantum optical master equation are presented .",
    "it is important to note that the quantum optical master equation is derived under the rotating wave approximation , which assumes the following separation of time scales @xmath11 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the correlation time for the environment , @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the typical frequencies or energy levels of the open quantum system , and @xmath16 the relaxation time for the open quantum system .",
    "since the relaxation time of the system scales as @xmath17 , this approach should be ideal in studying the real - time dynamics involving transitions among well - separated bound states .",
    "on the other hand , quantum brownian motion , which is studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , is derived by assuming a different time scale separation @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the spacing of energy levels of the system is expected to get smaller when the heavy quarks are almost liberated from bound states , be it in a heavy - light meson or heavy quarkonium , where thus this approach will become suitable .",
    "note that quantum brownian motion of heavy quarks should not necessarily be described by the caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "we will follow and extend the philosophy of the stochastic potential @xcite , which has several appealing features .",
    "the imaginary part of the complex heavy quark - antiquark potential @xcite can be naturally interpreted as damping due to wave function decoherence between different realizations of the stochastic potential .",
    "it models the random microscopic collisions between heavy quarks and medium particles and thus makes the energy of the heavy quark system fluctuate . in each realization of the stochastic potential ,",
    "the particle number of heavy quarks and that of heavy antiquarks are explicitly conserved separately , as they should be in the non - relativistic limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it is pointed out that when @xmath19 the energy increases linearly without bound in the stochastic description and thus the system does not get thermalized .",
    "what is missing in the stochastic description @xcite is an irreversible process , namely friction , which prevents the energy to rise forever .",
    "remember that not all the forces are described by potentials in the hamiltonian and a typical counterexample is the drag force .",
    "therefore when the heavy quark mass is finite @xmath19 , the proper quantum description of heavy quark systems must incorporate this friction process as well as the screened potential and thermal fluctuations , which are already properly modeled by the stochastic potential in the @xmath20 limit .",
    "interestingly , even though a classical description is mostly sufficient and consistent in describing energy loss and diffusion processes of single heavy quarks , its quantum description becomes a requisite in describing the quantum dynamics of heavy quarkonia .",
    "a similar argument but in a different context is found in ref .",
    "@xcite    the main purpose of this paper is to study how the in - medium qcd forces , here namely the screened potential , drag force , and their thermal fluctuations , should be incorporated in the quantum description of heavy quark systems from first principle on the basis of the closed - time path ( ctp ) formalism of non - equilibrium quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we apply the ctp formalism to qcd and derive the real - time dynamics of heavy quarks as open quantum systems , in leading - order perturbation theory and in the non - relativistic limit . in this approximation",
    ", the effect of the medium enters into the real - time dynamics of heavy quarks through the screening and scattering by the hard medium particles . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : rtd ] , the essence of the real - time dynamics is encapsulated in a renormalized effective hamiltonian for the doubled degrees of freedom on each time path , which provides all the time - evolution equations of interest : the master equation of the reduced density matrix and the time - evolution equation of the forward correlator for an arbitrary number of heavy quarks and heavy antiquarks . it is found that thermal fluctuation ( friction ) derives from the two - point functions of gluon fields in leading order ( next - to - leading order ) in the low frequency limit and that the order in the low - frequency expansion of the two - point functions directly translates into the order in the non - relativistic expansion of heavy quark interaction terms . by analyzing these time - evolution equations , the drag force @xcite and the complex potential @xcite in leading - order perturbation are reproduced simultaneously .",
    "concentrating on around the diagonal parts of the reduced density matrix in the position representation , the master equation is reduced to that of the caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "we will then show how friction can be incorporated in the stochastic time evolution .",
    "we will see that complex noise as well as real noise are necessary in the stochastic description . the stochastic evolution of the wave function and that of its _ conjugate _ , or in other words the forward and backward propagation of the wave function , turn out to be independent , which is convincing because friction processes are irreversible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : if ] , we will introduce the close - time path formalism of non - equilibrium quantum field theory and derive both the influence functional and the effective action in leading - order perturbation theory and in the non - relativistic limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : reh ] , we will derive an effective hamiltonian corresponding to the effective action .",
    "the normal - ordered renormalized effective hamiltonian is also calculated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rtd ] , various real - time dynamical equations , namely the master equation for the reduced density matrix , the time - evolution equation of the forward correlator , and a stochastic schrdinger equation , are derived from the renormalized effective hamiltonian . in sec .",

    "one of the processes ( 1 ) is the so - called gluo - dissociation @xcite , by which heavy quarkonium bound states can be excited to the unbound continuum states .",
    "the processes ( 2 ) include transitions between color - singlet heavy quarkonium states , which are important at low temperature , in particular in the confined phase , because only the color - singlet states are relevant there .",
    "therefore the renormalized effective hamiltonian at the next - to - leading order will also give us an important insight on how to model these processes in the phenomenological and effective description in the non - perturbative region .",
    "first of all , i would like to thank alexander rothkopf and chiho nonaka for carefully reading the manuscript .",
    "i would like to thank mikko laine , alexander rothkopf , and yannis burnier for their kind hospitality at university of bern and for fruitful discussions .",

    "here we derive some of the relations among the gluonic two - point functions in the instantaneous approximation . from the definition",
    ", it follows that @xmath340 using the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition @xmath341 , analyticity of the forward correlator @xmath342 in a stripe @xmath343 in the complex time plane and assuming that the damping of the correlation at @xmath344 , the instantaneous approximation of the retarded propagator yields an euclidean correlator : @xmath345\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau\\langle { \\bm a}^{a}_{0}(t =- i\\tau,\\vec x){\\bm a}^{b}_{0}(t=0,\\vec y)\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously @xmath109 is real . using the kms condition , we can derive @xmath346 and thus @xmath347 is also real .",
    "the above results give the relations among @xmath348s .",
    "the spectral function of gluon fields , which is a real and odd function of @xmath14 , is expressed in terms of the forward correlator and retarded propagator : @xmath349\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( 1-e^{-\\beta\\omega})g^>_{ab,00}(\\omega,\\vec x-\\vec y)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( e^{\\beta\\omega}-1)g^<_{ab,00}(\\omega,\\vec x-\\vec y)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 2{\\rm im}\\left[g^{\\rm r}_{ab,00}(\\omega,\\vec x-\\vec y)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the fact that @xmath350 is purely imaginary , which derives from the definition of @xmath351 , we obtain @xmath352 which completes the derivation of all the relations among two - point functions .",
    "we show here how the classical langevin equation is derived from the stochastic description . for simplicity , we derive the langevin equation for muons in a qed plasma composed of photons and electrons .",
    "let us start from the stochastic representation of the master equation eq .   adapted to qed : @xmath353 using the stochastic evolution operators : @xmath354,\\\\",
