    "exploring possible evidence of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium is one of the most important and challenging problems in hadron physics .",
    "experimental studies along this line have been carried out by the spectroscopy of deeply bound pionic atoms @xcite , by low energy pion - nucleus scatterings @xcite , and by the production of di - pions in hadron - nucleus and photon - nucleus reactions @xcite .",
    "important experimental observations are ( i ) a _ repulsive enhancement _ of the in - medium @xmath6-nucleon interaction in the pionic atoms and pion - nucleus scattering , and ( ii ) an _ attractive enhancement _ of the scalar - isoscalar @xmath7-@xmath7 interaction in nuclei . in the theoretical side , it was suggested that the reduction of the temporal part of the pion decay constant in the nuclear medium @xmath2 is intimately related to the phenomenon ( i ) @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that the reduction of @xmath2 is responsible for the phenomenon ( ii ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present theoretical basis of the direct connection between @xmath2 and the in - medium quark condensate @xmath1 ( the order parameter of the chiral phase transition ) only by using the current commutation relations , spectral decomposition and the linear density approximation .",
    "we derive an exact sum rule relating the in - medium quark condensate and hadronic matrix elements valid for all density in the chiral limit .",

    "gives a new way to estimate @xmath1 from the experimental data of the pionic atoms and the pion - nucleus and pion - nucleon scatterings without recourse to the information of @xmath5 as will be shown in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : exact ] , we derive the exact sum rule for the quark condensate valid for all density in the chiral limit . in section [ sec : gw ] , we show that the exact sum rule leads to the in - medium gw relation and the in - medium gor relation which are valid at low density . in section [ sec : wf ] , we evaluate the reduction of @xmath12 by relating it to the isoscalar @xmath7n scattering amplitude . in section",
    "[ sec : tw ] , we derive the in - medium tw relation in the chiral limit . in section [ sec : qc ] , utilizing all the results derived , the in - medium quark condensate is related to the observables in @xmath7-nucleus and @xmath7n scattering data . in section [ sec : offcl ] , we discuss how the exact sum rule is expressed off the chiral limit , based on the pcac relation . in section [ sec : chpt ] the relation of the present argument to the in - medium chiral perturbation theory is discussed .",

    "the expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath88 in nuclear matter up to the linear term in density reads @xmath89 for @xmath32 in eq.([eq : aphicorr ] ) , the first term in the right hand side of eq.([eq : linear - density ] ) is dominated by the massless pion in the chiral limit .",
    "the second term corresponds to the forward scattering amplitude of the external fields ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) with the nucleon multiplied by @xmath92 .    as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , there are four different contributions to the forward amplitude ; ( a ) the term with double @xmath7 pole where both @xmath90 and @xmath91 couple directly to the pion , ( b , c ) the term with single @xmath7 pole where either @xmath90 or @xmath91 couples directly to the pion , and ( d ) the term without @xmath7 pole where the external fields couple directly to the nucleon .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath93-wave coupling of the pion or the external fields to the nucleon gives vanishing contribution to the forward amplitude in ( a - d ) . on the other hand , the @xmath94-wave coupling in ( a , b",

    "in particular , particle - hole excitations do not contribute to the sum rule in the linear - density approximation .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that only the pionic mode with possible medium modification contributes to the sum rule in the previous section at low density : @xmath95 note that eq.([eq : pifzqq ] ) is only valid if both sides are expanded up to @xmath96 .    taking the ratio of eq . and its counterpart at zero density",
