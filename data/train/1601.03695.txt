    "vortices and solitons are among the most striking features of superfluids and superconductors .",
    "recent experimental advances in cold atomic gases have made it possible to study multi - component systems with a vector order parameter @xcite .",
    "the nature of vortices and solitons in such systems is far from being a trivial extension of the single component case . in the context of bose - einstein condensates ( becs )",
    "the situation is very rich .",
    "not only it is possible to have condensates with two or more components , but it is also feasible to tune the interaction strengths , which allows to explore the nature of vortices in different phases ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , if the components correspond to different spin states of the same atom , it is possible to produce coherent rabi coupling between the components using _ rf _ transitions , yielding novel topological features in the structure of vortices and solitons .    in this work",
    "we consider a mixture of two coherently coupled becs .",
    "some properties of these systems like coherent rabi oscillations , internal self - trapping effects , and the ferromagnetic classical bifurcation have already been addressed experimentally  @xcite . in the absence of rabi coupling",
    ", a two - component bose gas has a @xmath0 gauge symmetry , which is broken in the condensed , superfluid phase . in this case vortices behave similarly to the single component case as long as the inter - component interaction is small enough and the mixture is miscible . in the presence of rabi coupling , which produces coherent transitions between the spin components ,",
    "the situation drastically changes .",
    "the gas has only a single @xmath1 symmetry related to the conservation of the total particle number , and a gap opens in the spin channel , since the coupling locks the relative phase of the order parameter of different spin components .",
    "as pointed out in the seminal paper by son and stephanov  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , in coherently coupled uniform two - component superfluids , vortex lines in a single component can not exist as single objects , but only in pairs of different spin components ( the so called _",
    "half - vortices _ ) , which are connected by a domain wall .",
    "the domain wall can be interpreted as a sine - gordon soliton and is characterized by a @xmath2 jump in the relative phase of the two spin components .",
    "vortices can exist only in pairs because a single vortex would be attached to a domain wall of infinite area , with an infinite energy cost .",
    "stationary configurations of vortex pairs ( also known as _ merons _",
    "@xcite ) have already been investigated by solving the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in the presence of a rotating trapped two - component gas  @xcite . in the same spirit ,",
    "numerical extensions to more than two coherently coupled becs have been produced in recent years  @xcite .",
    "pairs of half - vortices connected by a domain wall share many features with quark confinement in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in particular , the surface energy related to the domain wall is proportional to its length and creates a distance - independent force that attracts vortices to each other . if the surface tension of the wall is large enough , it can break , creating new pairs of vortices similar to string breaking in qcd .    in the present work",
    ", we provide an explicit investigation of the precession of vortex pairs emphasizing , in particular , the competitive role played by the the magnus force acting on a moving vortex , and the attractive force due to the surface tension of the domain wall .",
    "furthermore , we show explicitly that the domain wall connecting the vortex pair breaks for large values of the rabi coupling . our analysis is based on the 2d gp equations @xmath3 for the order parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the two components respectively .",
    "the two equations are coupled not only by the inter - component interaction term proportional to @xmath6 , but also by the rabi coupling @xmath7 between the two spin states . in the above equations @xmath8 is the single - particle hamiltonian , and",
    "@xmath9 is the radial coordinate measuring the distance from the trap s center ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the presence of the rabi coupling implies that , at equilibrium , the phases of the two components are equal : @xmath11 . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath12 and consider the miscible ( paramagnetic ) case , ensured by the inequality @xmath13 .",
    "then the rabi coupling implies that the equilibrium densities are equal : @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "a simple macroscopic description of the dynamics of these novel configurations is obtained by considering a vortex pair located symmetrically with respect to the center of the harmonic potential and by writing the excess energy per particle with respect to the ground state in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance of each vortex from the center ( and hence @xmath20 is the distance separating the two vortices ) . in the above equation @xmath21",
    "is the energy of a single vortex , for which one can use the macroscopic estimate @xmath22 $ ] @xcite ; @xmath23 is the thomas - fermi radius of the trapped atomic cloud , @xmath24 is the number of atoms and @xmath25 is the healing length , while    @xmath26    [ eq.tension ]    is the surface energy associated with the domain wall connecting the two vortices . in the above equations @xmath27 is the surface tension  @xcite of the wall and @xmath28 is the density of the gas . in a uniform medium",
    "the energy @xmath29 increases linearly with the distance @xmath19 . finally , @xmath30 is the energy of the repulsive interaction between the two vortices fixed by the inter - species coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "this interaction energy was calculated analytically in @xcite in the absence of a coherent coupling ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "starting with the above equations , one can calculate the precession frequency characterizing the rotation of the vortex pair as @xmath32 where the angular momentum @xmath33 of the vortical configuration is calculated in terms of the distance @xmath19 of each vortex from the center using the relation  @xcite @xmath34 , holding for 2d harmonically trapped condensates .    for",
    "a fixed value of the interaction parameters and the rabi coupling @xmath35 , the precession angular velocity will depend on the distance @xmath20 .",
    "the above formalism is immediately generalized to the case of a trap rotating with angular velocity @xmath36 by adding the term @xmath37 to the expression for the total energy .    in principle the same formalism would also allow for the determination of the size of the pair at equilibrium ( vortex molecule ) .",
    "the corresponding condition is fixed by the equation @xmath38 .",
    "notice that this condition implies the absence of precession , as immediately follows from ( [ precession ] ) .",
    "the occurrence of a stable vortex molecule with @xmath39 can not be ensured in the absence of the repulsive interaction term @xmath40 in eq.([ed ] ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath41 , the stationary solution @xmath42 always corresponds to a local maximum of @xmath43 rather than to a minimum .    in order to make the role of rabi coupling clearer",
    ", we first consider the case of the absence of inter - component interaction , i.e. we assume @xmath44 .",
    "in this case the precession frequency in the absence of rotation ( @xmath45 ) results from the competition between @xmath29 and @xmath46 , which act in opposite directions .",
    "assuming @xmath47 one finds @xmath48 showing that , if @xmath49 ( and hence @xmath29 ) is sufficiently large the precession will proceed in the opposite direction with respect to the flow generated by the vortex line .",
    "in the limit @xmath50 , the precession frequency will be proportional to the surface tension of the wall and hence to @xmath51 .",
    "this result can also be obtained by considering the equilibrium between the magnus force and the surface tension @xmath52 : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the velocity of the vortex line with respect to the fluid .",
    "the vector @xmath55 , with modulus @xmath56 , is oriented along the vortex line and indicates the velocity circulation . in the calculation of the magnus force we used the unperturbed value @xmath57 for the density of each component .",
    "the condition @xmath58 is easily achieved experimentally . in the following we will consider a gas of sodium atoms confined by a harmonic potential with trap frequency @xmath59 and with a chemical potential @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the central density . this corresponds to a thomas - fermi radius @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the harmonic oscillator length . in the presence of rabi coupling @xmath64 one",
    "then finds that a vortex pair , separated by the distance @xmath65 , is characterized by the precession frequency @xmath66 .",
    "setting @xmath67 one instead would find the value @xmath68 of opposite sign .",
    "the above model , including eq .",
    "( [ eq.tension ] ) for the surface tension , is justified as long as the width of the domain wall , fixed by the relationship @xmath69 , is much larger than the healing length @xmath70 , but much smaller than the size @xmath20 of the vortex pair . if the width @xmath71 of the domain wall is much larger than the size of the vortex pair ( corresponding to very small values of @xmath72 )",
    ", the effect of the rabi coupling should be treated using a perturbative approach  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig12 ] we show the typical behavior of the relative phase of a vortex pair in the presence of a 2d harmonic trap , obtained by solving numerically the coupled gp eqs .",
    "( [ gp ] ) with @xmath44 .",
    "the structure of the domain wall is clearly visible .",
    "the result shown in the figure is obtained as follows : first , we symmetrically imprint two vortices , one in each component , far away from the trap s center ; then we perform an imaginary time evolution , during which the domain wall in the relative phase forms and the vortices start approaching each other , with the energy of the system decreasing .",
    "we stop the simulation at a certain point , in order to produce a vortex pair of the desired size .",
    "this configuration serves as the initial condition for a subsequent real time evolution , in which the pair exhibits precession . the configuration in fig .",

    "the phase @xmath75 is instead single valued . ]",
    "[ fig12](b ) shows explicitly the behavior of the phases of the two components calculated along the contour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) , i.e. , around the vortex of the spin component 1 .",
    "the figure clearly reveals the @xmath2 jump in the relative phase @xmath78 near the domain wall .    by solving the gp equation in real time",
    "one can investigate the precession of the vortex pair and evaluate the precession frequency @xmath79 , whose dependence on the rabi coupling @xmath80 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for different values of the vortex size @xmath19 .     on the rabi coupling @xmath80 for different values of the vortex separation @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical solution of the gp equations ( component 1 - bullets , component 2 - triangles ) are in a good agreement with the analytical expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq.prec ] ) , ( solid lines ) for large values of @xmath20 ( in units of @xmath81 ) .",
    "the inset is a zoom of the figure for small values @xmath80 , where @xmath82 changes sign . ]",
    "its dependence on @xmath19 , for a fixed value of @xmath80 , is instead shown in fig .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations are found to agree reasonably well with the predictions of the macroscopic model  ( [ eq.prec ] ) discussed in the first part of the paper ( see solid lines in the figures ) . as expected ,",
    "the discrepancies become smaller if the width of the domain wall becomes much smaller compared to the vortex separation @xmath83 .",
    "( component 1 - bullets , component 2 - triangles ) on @xmath84 ( in units of @xmath85 ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq.prec ] ) . as in the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the agreement is good as long as the distance @xmath20 separating the two vortices is sufficiently large . ]    for large values of @xmath49 a long domain wall may decay into smaller fragments , resulting in the creation of new vortex pairs at the ends of these new fragments .",
    "this fragmentation is an analogue of string breaking in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the probability of such a fragmentation becomes larger and larger as @xmath49 grows . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the result of the fragmentation of a domain wall obtained at @xmath86 and @xmath87 . the initial configuration  a domain wall symmetric with respect to the center of the trap ",
    "was then allowed to evolve through the time @xmath88 .",
    "the figure clearly shows three fragments of various sizes , connecting vortices of different components .    .",
    "one can see fragments of different size , connecting vortices of different components .",
    "the gp simulation was carried out choosing @xmath87 and @xmath86 .",
    "the initial condition corresponded to a domain wall between the vortex pair of length @xmath89 , symmetric with respect to the trap s center .",
    "the figure is a zoom of the central region of the cloud . ]    in the introduction we emphasized the fact that , in a uniform , infinite system in the presence of the rabi coupling , vortices can not exist alone as single objects but only in pairs . in a finite system , such as in the presence of a confinement ,",
    "single vortex lines can also exist , as the domain wall will cost a finite amount of energy , fixed by the size of the atomic cloud .",
    "we have explored single vortex configurations by considering a vortex line ( corresponding to the component 1 ) located at some distance from the center of the trap . the domain wall which minimizes the energy corresponds to the shortest line connecting the vortex to the external region outside the thomas - fermi radius , where the density of the atomic cloud is vanishing ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) . when solving the gp equations  ( [ gp ] ) in real time , the vortex line in component 1 exhibits the precession according to the macroscopic prediction ( [ ed])-([precession ] ) with @xmath90 replaced by @xmath46 and @xmath29 calculated along the domain wall .",
    "however , we soon find the appearance of a second vortex in component 2 , attached to the second end of the wall and emerging from the border , where its energy cost is vanishingly small .",
    "the two vortices then start rotating around each other .",
    "eventually the original vortex of the component 1 reaches the border of the atomic cloud to disappear and reappear again after a while ( an analogous behavior of vortices in a toroidal trap was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the results presented above were obtained assuming the inter - component interaction parameter to be @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath6 is small compared to the intra - component coupling constants , @xmath12 , we find that the influence of @xmath6 on the precession is almost negligible , the main role being played by the long - range surface tension force .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that stable molecules have a very small size , even for relatively large values of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is close to @xmath91 , one can identify a critical value for the rabi coupling , given by the expression @xmath92 @xcite , above which the domain wall becomes unstable and the solution of the gp equations corresponds to a local maximum of energy , rather than to a local minimum .    .",
    "then , the vortex starts precessing and induces the appearance of a second vortex in the component 2 . ]",
    "we expect that our predictions for the precession of half - vortex pairs and for the fragmentation of the corresponding domain wall at large rabi coupling will stimulate new measurements on coherently coupled becs .",
    "experimentally , pairs of half - vortices , connected by a domain wall , can be created by the proper imprinting of the relative phase of the two condensates .",
    "the shape of the domain wall connecting the two vortical lines is in principle observable using heterodyne methods giving rise to visible interference in the domain wall region .",
    "the precession effect could be measured using real - time detection techniques ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
