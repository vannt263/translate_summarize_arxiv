    "we shall be concerned here with the current - current correlators in the coordinate space : [ twopoint ] ( x)= 0|j(x)j^(0)|0  , in case of the @xmath1 and ( pseudo)scalar currents : j_^(va)&=&|q_i_(1_5)q_j  , + j^sp&=&[(m_i- m_j)(m_i+m_j)]|q_i(1_5)q_j  , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the quark fields and masses .",
    "the two - point functions ( [ twopoint ] ) obey a dispersion representation : ( x)=_0^dt  k_1(x )  im(t )  , where im@xmath4 is related to the current induced cross section and @xmath5 is the modified bessel function , which behaves for small @xmath6 as : k(z0)+z  . in the limit @xmath7",
    ", @xmath8 coincides with the free - field correlator and the main theoretical issue is how the asymptotic freedom gets violated at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "+ from pure theoretical point of view , the use of the @xmath0-space is no better than the use of the momentum space , which is the traditional tool of the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "each representation has its own advantages and inconveniences ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-space approach is motivated and described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the current correlators ( [ twopoint ] ) are measured in the most direct way on the lattice .",
    "the importance of the lattice measurements @xcite is that they allow to study the correlation functions for currents with various quantum numbers , while direct experimental information is confined to only vector and axial - vector currents @xcite .",
    "the well - known @xmath9-decay data were widely used for theoretical analyses both in the @xmath10- and @xmath0-spaces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most recently , new lattice data on the @xmath11 channels were obtained @xcite .",
    "the most interesting observation is that in the @xmath12 channel there are noticeable deviations from the instanton liquid model @xcite while in the @xmath13 channels the agreement of the existing data with this model is quite good @xcite .",
    "+ such deviations were in fact predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite where unconventional quadratic corrections , @xmath14 were introduced .",
    "the primary aim of the present note is to perform a more detailed comparison of the lattice data with the model of ref .",
    "we , indeed , find further support for the quadratic corrections .",
    "however , the overall picture is far from being complete and we are trying to analyze the data in a more generic way .",
    "the central assumption is that the violations of the parton model for the correlators at moderate @xmath0 are due to power - like corrections .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we begin with a summary of theoretical expressions for the current correlators , both in the @xmath15 and @xmath16spaces .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath1 and @xmath17 channels since the recent lattice data @xcite refer to these channels . in case of @xmath1 currents",
    "the correlator is defined as : [ odin ] _ ( q)=id^4x  e^iqxtj_(x)j_(0)^= ( q_q_-g_q^2)(q^2 )  , where @xmath18 in the euclidean space - time . for the sake of definiteness we fix the flavor structure of the light - quark current @xmath19 as : j_^va=|u_(1_5 ) d  . in the chiral limit one has in the @xmath20 case ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) : [ sum ] ^v+a(q^2 )  =  12 ^ 2 - 1+_s -_s^2q^2 + 3_s(g^a_)^2q^4 + 256 ^ 381_s|qq^2q^6  .",
    "the corresponding relation for the @xmath21 case reads as : [ difference ] ^v - a(q^2 )  = -  , in the x - space the same correlators , upon dividing by @xmath22 where @xmath22 stands for the perturbative correlator , are obtained by applying the equations collected for convenience in the table [ fourier ] .",
    ".some useful fourier transforms [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the analysis indicates that a much better fit of the lattice data for the @xmath12 channel at moderate values of @xmath0 is achieved after the inclusion of the @xmath23 , or @xmath24 quadratic correction .",
    "a caveat is that we account only for the power corrections , not pure perturbative contributions .",
    "the reason is that the lattice data , in their present status , do not give any clear indication of the perturbative contributions .",
    "note also that the data can not discriminate between the values of the dimension four and six condensates entering in set 1 and set 2 as the effects of these two condensates tend to compensate each other for the choice @xmath25 .",
    "the agreement of the ope with the lattice data at larger values of @xmath0 can be obtained by the inclusion of the @xmath26 condensate with a size @xmath27 where we have used @xmath28 .",
    "this value can be compared with the one @xmath29 , which one would obtain from the evaluation of these contributions in @xcite and where a modified factorization of the gluon condensates proposed in @xcite has been used .",
    "channel : comparison of the lattice data from @xcite with the ope predictions for the set 3 qcd condensates values given in table 2 including a fitted value of the @xmath26 contributions .",
    "the diamond curve is the prediction from the instanton liquid model of @xcite .",
    ", width=491 ]    for completion , we show in fig .",
    "2 , a fit of the lattice data in the v+a channel using set 3 values of the gluon and quark condensates and quadratic term plus a @xmath26 contribution with the strength @xmath30 to be compared with the one @xmath31 which one would obtain using the results in @xcite .",
    "both fits in figs 1 and 2 might indicate that the vacuum saturation can be strongly violated for higher dimension condensates , a feature already encountered from different analysis of the @xmath9 and @xmath32 data @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would also expect analogous large deviations in the v - a channel .",
    "while evaluating the emerging picture of the power corrections , one should face the possibility that the standard ope ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is valid only at very short distances .",
    "what is even more important , the mass scale where higher terms in the ope become numerically comparable to the lowest ones is not necessarily the scale associated with the resonances but could be considerably higher .",
    "there is accumulating evidence to support such a view : + ( 1 ) a direct comparison of the ope with the lattice data in the @xmath21 channel demonstrates that the convergence radius of the ope is no larger than 0.3 fm @xcite . + ( 2 ) within the instanton liquid model @xcite , the distance between instantons is a few times larger than the size of the instantons . on the physical grounds",
    ", the ope applies at distances smaller than the instanton size while the resonance properties are rather related to distance between the instantons ( if encoded in the model at all ) . respectively ,",
    "neither the lattice data nor the predictions of the instanton liquid model exhibit any irregularity at the convergence radius of the ope @xcite .",
    "+ ( 3 ) within the monopole - dominated - vacuum model the two scales are even more pronounced numerically : the monopole radius is about 0.06 fm while the distance between the monopoles is about 0.5 fm @xcite . + ( 4 ) if one replaces the local condensates of the standard ope by their non - local counterparts ( for a review see @xcite ) , then the effect of the non - locality is strong already at @xmath33 fm @xcite .",
    "if , indeed , the validity of the standard ope derived within the fundamental qcd is shrunk to very short distances , then improving within the standard ope fits to the data obtained at presently available lattices might not be a proper criterion for selecting the right model .",
    "instead , there emerges a picture according to which the non - standard quadratic power corrections dominate the presently available `` intermediate distances '' of about @xmath34 fm .",
    "there are two pieces of evidence of the quadratic corrections dominating over the whole range of intermediate distances indicated above : + ( 1 ) non - perturbative contribution to the heavy quark potential is linear at all the distances @xmath35 fm ( for discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) instanton density , as function of the instanton size @xmath36 is reproduced at all the distances @xmath37 fm @xcite .",
    "+ moreover , + ( 3 ) introduction of the tachyonic gluon mass explains in a simple and unified way existence of the strong channel dependence of the scales of the violation of the asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "+ to this list we add now a new observation : + ( 4 ) instanton - liquid model plus the @xmath38 correction gives a reasonable fit in the @xmath39 channel at distances @xmath34 fm .",
    "as for the status of the @xmath38 correction it is most solid within the effective higgs - like theories which are common within the monopole mechanism of confinement .",
    "indeed , in the presence of a magnetically charged ( effective ) scalar field the symmetry of the theory is @xmath40 @xcite . upon the spontaneous breaking of the magnetic @xmath41 the gauge boson acquires a non - vanishing mass and",
    "its mass squared is the only parameter of dimension @xmath42 consistent with the symmetry .",
    "moreover , in exchanges between ( color ) charged particles the gauge - boson mass appears to be tachyonic mass as was demonstrated on the @xmath41 example in refs .",
    "detailed analysis of various power corrections within the higgs - like models can be found in refs .",
    "moreover , if the monopole size is indeed as small as indicated above , then the effective higgs - like theories can apply at all the distances @xmath43 fm .    to summarize",
    ", the @xmath38 corrections introduced in @xcite rather drastically improve agreement of the theoretical predictions for the current correlator in the @xmath39 channel with the lattice data ( without affecting the other channels measured ) , in the moderate @xmath0-region , and which can be extended to higher @xmath0-values by including higher dimension condensates .",
    "the main uncertainty of the analysis is due to neglect of the pure perturbative corrections , not detected so far on the lattice .",
    "further checks could be provided by measuring the current correlators in the other channels discussed in @xcite .",
    "the success of the fits with @xmath38 corrections included can be understood within the effective theories .",
