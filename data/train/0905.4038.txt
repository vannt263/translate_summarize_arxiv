    "low - dimensional spin 1/2 magnets are of wide interest in solid state physics since they are ideal objects to study the interplay of dimensionality , magnetic frustration and strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "these compounds can be described often very successfully based on their magnetically active structural building blocks and their linking .",
    "typical examples for such building blocks are ti(iii)o@xmath5 octahedra , v(iv)o@xmath6 square pyramids or cu(ii)o@xmath7 plaquettes that form various spin 1/2 networks like quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains or ladders .",
    "nevertheless , for a reliable and accurate description of such networks , precise model parameters are a precondition , especially in the vicinity of quantum critical points . however , since for new compounds these parameters are unknown , it is common to transfer the known parameters from related , similar systems in a slightly renormalized form according to changed distances and/or bond angles .",
    "a typical example for the application of this strategy are compounds that contain crystal water in different amounts .",
    "although in some cases the topology of the magnetic network and the related magnetic properties totally change upon dehydration like in the case of cusio@xmath8@xmath1h@xmath0o  @xcite and cusio@xmath8  @xcite , for most compounds only moderate structural changes with respect to the magnetic network are observed .",
    "it is generally assumed that in this case crystal water leads mainly to a modest change of the crystal field for the magnetic ion . in turn ,",
    "small changes in the crystal field only , would directly suggest a description within the same model with slightly revised parameters.@xcite this leads to the common believe that crystal water plays only a minor role regarding the magnetic properties for compounds where crystal structure is basically preserved upon water intercalation .    here",
    ", in contrast , we show that the hydration of cucl@xmath0 to cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o fundamentally changes the magnetic properties , although the topology of the covalent cu - cl network is seemingly unchanged . whereas cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o is a classical three - dimensional ( 3d ) antiferromagnet ( afm ) with a nel temperature of 4.3k",
    ", we establish the dehydrated species as an example for a quasi 1d chain compound .",
    "the results of susceptibility measurements , density functional and model calculations can be consistently understood from a reorientation of the magnetically active cu orbital driven by the hydration . regarding the well known 3d magnetic nature of cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o,@xcite",
    "the quasi 1d behavior of the water free compound cucl@xmath0 is rather surprising : cucl@xmath0 is a @xmath2@xmath3 heisenberg chain model compound with fm nearest neighbor ( nn ) exchange @xmath2 and afm next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) exchange @xmath3 . according to the estimated @xmath9 we predict a helical magnetic order below the observed transition at 24k .",
    "earlier studies @xcite that tried to model cucl@xmath0 as a spin 1/2 chain found considerable deviations from a 1d behavior since in these investigations only nn afm coupling was considered .",
    "alternatively a 1d model with afm nn and nnn exchanges was suggested , but this model yields far too large couplings.@xcite",
    "the crystal structure of cucl@xmath0 is presented in fig .  [ bonds ] .",
    "cu and cl form a covalent network of edge shared cucl@xmath7 plaquettes running along @xmath10 direction .",
    "such fourfold planar cu@xmath11 coordination suggests a strong analogy to the undoped cuprates .",
    "the cu - cl - cu bond angle is 93.6@xmath12 and thus very similar to that in the cuo@xmath0 chain cuprate family , where bond angles close to 90@xmath12 result in fm nn exchange like in li@xmath0cuo@xmath0,@xcite licu@xmath0o@xmath0@xcite and li@xmath0zrcuo@xmath7.@xmath3 chain models with fm nn and afm nnn exchange , where the different @xmath13 ratios lead to different ground states.]@xcite as in the latter two compounds , these chains are arranged in layers ( fig .",
    "[ bonds ] , top ) , suggesting a rather weak exchange between the layers .",
    "since even the arrangement of the chains within the layers is very similar , a quasi 1d behavior might be expected from a mere comparison with these cuprate crystal structures .",
    "when cucl@xmath0 is exposed to moisture , h@xmath0o enters the space between the chain layers , finally forming the fully hydrated cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o ( fig .  [ bonds ] , bottom ) .",
    "although the crystal structure seems very similar at a first glance , the crystal water induces several changes : ( i ) the inter - layer distance increases , ( ii ) the cucl@xmath0 chains shift with respect to each other and , ( iii ) the cu - cl distances within the chains are modified . whereas the structural changes can be easily understood by packing and electrostatics ( negatively polarized o@xmath14 is situated close to the cu@xmath11 ions , h@xmath15 is attracted by cl@xmath16 ) , the origin of the drastic change of magnetic properties ",
    "1d versus 3d  is far from obvious .",
    "unraveling the underlying microscopic physics is the aim of our joint theoretical and experimental study .",
    "polycrystalline cucl@xmath0 was prepared by dehydration of cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o ( alfa aesar 99.999% ) under vacuum at 390k .",
    "single crystals were grown by chemical transport in a temperature gradient from 650k to 575k with alcl@xmath8 ( alfa aesar 99.999% , ultra dry ) as transport agent .",
    "the chemical characterization of cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o and of the cucl@xmath0 crystals was carried out by x - ray powder diffraction , dsc / tg - methods and chemical analysis .",
    "the heat of dehydration was determined by dsc .",
    "based on five independent measurements , the heat of dehydration is @xmath17kj / mol at 400k .",
    "magnetization was measured in a squid magnetometer ( @xmath18k ) in magnetic fields up to 7 t .",

    "the data in a field @xmath19 t show no visible differences to the zero - field data .",
    "in contrast to the quasi 1d susceptibility of cucl@xmath0 , the hydrated system shows an increasing @xmath28 down to low temperatures right above the afm phase transition at 4.3k ( see fig .",
    "[ sus ] and inset @xmath27 ) in perfect agreement with earlier measurements.@xcite a curie - weiss temperature @xmath38k indicating weak afm interactions has been evaluated .",
    "the essentially different character of the susceptibility of both compounds points to a changed coupling regime rather than to a mere re - scaling according to the modified atomic distances . to construct an appropriate microscopic model based on the relevant interactions we perform _ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations , as successfully demonstrated earlier for the closely related cuo@xmath0 chain compound family @xcite .",
    "total and partial densities of states ( dos ) for both compounds are pictured in fig .",
    "[ dos ] . on a coarse energy scale",
    "both systems are similar , the contribution of the additional h states to the valence region is negligible .",
    "both compounds show half - filled , well separated anti - bonding bands at the fermi level .",
    "this metallic behavior is in contrast to the experiment and is a well known shortcoming of the lda due to the underestimation of the strong coulomb repulsion for the cu@xmath11 3@xmath21 configuration .",
    "the observed insulating ground state is obtained ( i ) within the lda+@xmath22 approximation or ( ii ) by a model approach mapping the relevant low lying lda states onto an effective tb model , and , including the correlations , subsequently onto a hubbard and a heisenberg model .",
    "a closer inspection of the dos and the related band structure reveals two important differences : ( i ) whereas the width of the anti - bonding band in cucl@xmath0 is 0.8ev  rather typical for 1d edge - shared cuo@xmath0 chains shows a bandwidth of 0.95ev for the anti - bonding band , cusio@xmath8 about 0.65ev and licuvo@xmath7 about 0.7ev . ]  the bandwidth in cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o is reduced by more than a factor of three to about 0.25ev ( fig .",
    "[ dos]d ) .",
    "( ii ) the magnetically active anti - bonding band in cucl@xmath0 is formed exclusively by cu - cl @xmath39 states ( inset fig .",
    "[ dos]a ) corresponding to the bonds pictured in fig .",
    "[ bonds ] .",
    "in contrast , for cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o the o 2@xmath40 orbitals that are directed towards the cu contribute significantly to this band ( inset fig .",

    "[ orbitals ] .",
    "these plaquettes , relevant for the magnetic couplings , form edge - shared chains in cucl@xmath0 , whereas they are isolated in the hydrated system .",
    "naturally , this `` orbital switching '' induced by the crystal water implies a change of the coupling regime from 1d to 3d . to study these changes on a quantitative level",

    "the calculated @xmath41 confirm the intuitive picture that corresponds to fig .",
    "[ orbitals ] : cucl@xmath0 shows quasi 1d dispersion along the chain with dominating nnn hopping @xmath42 , and a considerably weaker coupling between the chains , while the coupling between adjacent layers is very small . on the other hand ,",
    "the changed plaquette arrangement in cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o , induced by the crystal water , leads to a strongly reduced band width ( fig .",
    "[ dos]d ) and correspondingly small isotropic ( 3d ) transfer integrals ( table  [ table ] ) .    for the strongly correlated limit ( @xmath43 ) at half filling ,",
    "the tb model can be mapped via a hubbard model to a heisenberg model with resulting afm exchange couplings @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the correlation in the effective one - band description .",
    "depending on the choice of @xmath45 within a reasonable range @xcite ( @xmath46 ev ) this leads to exchange constants @xmath47k for the three leading couplings in cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o ( table  [ table ] ) .",
    "these @xmath48 s are perfectly in line with the experimentally observed @xmath49k as could be expected for an almost isotropic 3d coupling . for cucl@xmath0 , the leading nnn @xmath42 results in @xmath50k .",
    "although of the correct order of magnitude compared to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , this would clearly exceed the `` overall afm coupling '' in the compound without additional fm interactions .",
    "sizable fm interactions are typical for close to 90@xmath12 bond angles according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules @xcite and therefore expected for the nn @xmath2 in cucl@xmath0 . for a quantitative estimate of the fm contributions to the leading @xmath48 s",
    "we apply lsda+@xmath22 calculations for different spin arrangements in magnetic super cells .",

    "] indicating that fm contributions beyond nn are rather small .",
    "in contrast , we find a large fm contribution of about 175k to @xmath2 as expected from the cu - cl - cu bond angle of 93.6@xmath12 .",
    "the size of the fm contribution to @xmath2 fits well to related edge - shared cuo@xmath0 chain compounds.@xcite    .[table ] calculated leading hopping integrals @xmath41 for the effective tb model shown in fig .",

    "thus , the dehydration of cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o to cucl@xmath0 leads to a drastic change of the coupling regime from 3d to quasi 1d and a completely different ground state that can be traced back to a switch of the magnetically active orbital .      for an independent evaluation of the leading exchange interactions in cucl@xmath0 we simulated @xmath61 within a spin-1/2 @xmath2@xmath3 heisenberg model for various @xmath13 ratios using the tmrg technique and",

    "the remaining difference between @xmath79 and @xmath80 of about 30k corresponds in very good agreement to the inter - chain coupling @xmath81 of about 35k neglected in the ed simulations .",
    "the dramatic effect of the dehydration of cucl@xmath0@xmath12h@xmath0o certainly raises the question whether this is really a typical dehydration process or if the involvement of the crystal water related oxygen in the magnetic exchange via covalent cu - o bonds is an indication for a chemical reaction on a different energy scale .",
