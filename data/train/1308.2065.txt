    "there is a growing number of supernovae ( sne ) whose brightness greatly exceeds that of `` classic '' sne ( e.g. @xcite ) , hence not fitting into any of the standard sne classes .",
    "it is widely assumed , albeit somewhat arbitrarily , that an sn becomes an slsn if its absolute magnitude exceeds @xmath5  mag in any filter , what corresponds to the peak luminosity of @xmath6  erg / s . during the last few years most of slsn events have been discovered by several untargeted surveys , for example the catalina real - time transient survey ( @xcite ) and the palomar transient factory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . it was found that these over - luminous sne tend to prefer low - metallicity , low - mass dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the slsne are associated with deaths of the most massive stars , which means that they have impact on the chemical evolution and re - ionization of the universe .",
    "the slsne explosions are probably induced by various physical mechanisms than other , more common types of sne , which makes these transients more interesting . however , still little is known about the nature of slsne , because of insufficient size and low heterogeneity of the available sample ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the slsne family has been divided into three classes : slsn - i ( hydrogen - poor ) , slsn - ii ( hydrogen - rich ) , and slsn - r ( radioactively powered ) .",
    "slsn - r type seems to be the best understood one as these sne are powered by large amounts of radioactive @xmath7ni produced during the explosions of massive stars .",
    "the mechanism of the most commonly observed slsn - ii class can be explained by an explosion within a thick hydrogen envelope , but the proper energy source is still unknown .",
    "the final group , slsn - i explosions , is probably a result of pair - instability mechanism , but these sne are not powered by radioactivity . recently a different statement was presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors claim that type slsn - i can be classified as slsn - ic , because their spectral features are similar to typical ic explosions , i.e.  the blue continuum with broad absorption lines of intermediate mass elements such as c , o , si , and mg , with no clear evidence of h and he .",
    "moreover , the energy deposited by newborn magnetars was favored as the power source for these events instead of the pair - instability mechanism .",
    "a semi - analytical diffusion model with energy input from the spin - down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive light curve data well .",
    "the ejecta velocities and temperatures required by the model predictions are in a reasonable agreement with those determined from the photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "there are therefore some discrepancies in views on the real nature of the slsne , which is caused by a very small number of known examples of such explosions .    in this paper , we present the discovery of another object belonging to the class of slsne found in the sdss stripe 82 multi - band data .",
    "to date there are @xmath830 known slsne , therefore each new event observed is a valuable addition to the class . with its peak brightness of @xmath9  mag ( without including the @xmath10-correction and host galaxy extinction ) and the optical light curve shape",
    ", it closely resembles slsne .",
    "the subsequent sections include a detailed description of our findings .",

    ", width=302 ]    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) repeatedly observed several selected areas of the sky .",
    "one of them , called stripe 82 , covering @xmath8270 deg@xmath23 of the sky , was specifically targeted for multiple photometric observations ( @xcite ) in the hunt for type ia supernovae explosions .",
    "there were about 500 sne found in near - real - time data analysis , many of them followed - up spectroscopically ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stripe  82 covers the area of @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we used the catalog of @xcite that provided not only the photometric and astrometric time - series for almost 4 million objects , but also numerous high - level data products , useful for an effective querying of the catalog .",
    "we aimed at transients which lasted between 40 and 150 days and had mean luminosities brighter than 20.5 mag in @xmath17 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "in addition , we only looked for objects with a significant excess in blue at the peak .",
    "we found about 200 potentially interesting objects , most of them turning out to be previously found , known sne ( @xcite , @xcite ) . from the remainder we selected one transient with well covered light curve , exhibiting long rise and long decline , as a possible slsn .",
    "the transient was also located on top of a faint galaxy - like object ( according to the sdss data release 9 ; dr9 ) , which ruled out the possibility for a cataclysmic variable transient .",
    "the coordinates of the sn are @xmath26=(00:01:23.36,+00:05:04.02 ) and the finding chart is presented in figure [ fig : finding_chart ] .",
    "we dubbed the supernova with psn  000123 + 000504 aka `` vernal equinox supernova 2005 '' because of its position very close to the beginning of the equatorial coordinate system .",
    "the observed light curve of the sn is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "it is also available in tabular form for the observed magnitudes ( table  [ tab : observed ] ) , absolute magnitudes ( table  [ tab : absolute ] ) , and luminosity ( table  [ tab : luminosity ] ) .",
    "it is not clear why the object was not found by a regular search for sne during the stripe 82 observations , which were designed for real - time supernova hunt .",
    "most probably , the host galaxy was not recognized as a galaxy due to its compactness and blue color , suggesting a galactic progenitor of some sort of a cataclysmic variable . only after producing the final sdss images of this region ( in sdss dr9 )",
    "the object was classified as a galaxy .    while we do not have the spectrum for the sn during explosion",
    ", we can only rely on post - explosion observations . in the next section we present the evidence for the sn host galaxy redshift of @xmath1 which corresponds to the distance modulus of @xmath2  mag and the luminosity distance of 1428 mpc , assuming a standard @xmath27cdm cosmological model with @xmath28 .",
    "the milky way extinctions in the direction of the sn are @xmath29  mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the sn observed at magnitude @xmath30 is described by the equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance modulus , @xmath33 is the luminosity distance in mpc , a function of redshift @xmath20 and cosmological model @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the extinctions in our own milky way galaxy and in the sn host galaxy , respectively , and @xmath37 is the single filter _",
    "k_-correction ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two unknowns in equation  [ eq : abs ] .",
    "first of all , we do not know the value of @xmath36 , that is the internal host extinction at the sn location .",
    "however , because it can only make the sn brighter ( the larger the value the brighter the sn ) , it does not affect our interpretation of the sn as super - luminous one .",
    "the second unknown is the _",
    "k_-correction , as for its calculation we would need a spectrum near the peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ k_-correction at such a low redshift is not going to change the absolute magnitudes by more than a few tenths of magnitude in either direction .",
    "we converted the absolute magnitudes to luminosity ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] , figure  [ fig : temp_prof ] , and table  [ tab : luminosity ] ) .",
    "integrating the five - band sdss light curves over the duration of the transient , we estimated that the total emitted energy exceeded @xmath38 ergs .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the luminosity light curves .",
    "the first obvious finding is that the @xmath15-band ( near uv ) light curve peaks first ( at epoch 4 of the light curve ) , followed by optical light curves ( at epochs 56 ) , while the infrared light curves peak as the last ones , at more later epochs .",
    "this obviously reflects the changes in the spectrum of the object that are characteristic for an object with high early temperatures and low temperatures at late times ",
    "clear signs of an explosion or eruption . for each epoch",
    "we constructed five - point spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the photometric data and investigated the evolution of the sed shape with time . in figure",
    "[ fig : temp_prof ] , we present the supernova sed at selected epochs 1 , 4 , 6 , and 16 , corresponding to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42  days from the @xmath15-band peak at @xmath43 ( 24 september 2005 ) .",
    "we fitted a black - body ( bb ) spectrum at each epoch and obtained the best - fitting bb temperatures ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the bb fits to the early time ( pre - peak ) seds returned satisfying @xmath45 , pointing to a rather featureless spectra with high temperatures @xmath46  k. the situation changes when we fit the bb spectrum to the late time ( post - peak ) seds .",
    "the fits are statistically unacceptable with @xmath47 .",
    "this is easily explained if we assume that our object is to an sn .",
    "describes a normal sn type ii - p as having a featureless blue bb spectrum @xmath48  k at early times and a significant line evolution at late times with temperature reaching @xmath49  k few weeks later ( adiabatic expansion and cooling of the ejecta )  a picture perfectly fitting into our findings ( if ignoring the high luminosity )",

    "this is indicative of a significant line evolution at late epochs , characteristic for core - collapse sne .",
    "the luminosities were corrected for the galactic extinction.,width=302 ]",
    "the sn was found to be a transient in the stripe 82 data , i.e.  with no prior historical observations , forming a baseline .",
    "however , there is a faint galaxy - like object present in the sdss images ( @xcite ) at the location of psn  000123 + 000504 .",

    "while the spectrum has a rather low overall signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , we were able to identify ( amongst other ) the following major emission lines : h@xmath51 at 4861 , [ oiii ] at 4959  and 5007 , h@xmath52 at 6863 , and [ nii ] at 6884 , at a redshift @xmath1 ( figure [ fig : keck_spec ] ) .",

    "in this paper , we presented the discovery of an overlooked supernova in the sdss stripe  82 archival data , which we classified as an slsn one based on its peak optical magnitude brighter than @xmath66 .",
    "the sn was found in a search for long transient events with a significant blue excess at peak in a variability database for sdss stripe  82 . while we do not have the spectrum for the sn during explosion , we present the evidence for the sn host galaxy redshift of @xmath1 using the keck / lris spectrum .",
    "we also constructed the five - point sed from the photometric data and investigated its evolution as a function of time .",
    "we fitted the bb spectrum at each epoch and obtained a best - fitting bb temperature , greater than 15000k , in early time seds .",
    "the temperature evolution with a decline in late epochs to @xmath85000k also constitutes a strong piece of evidence in favor of classifying this object as a slsn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sne_lc ] , we present the @xmath11-band light curves of our sn . for comparison we also show the light curve of a likely type ii - n sn from the ogle database ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite for ogle sne overview ) , which is a few magnitudes fainter , but presents a similar shape of the light curve .",
    "overall , the shape of the light curve of psn  000123 + 000504 resembles very much that of objects found previously and classified as slsne .",
    "the rise of the light curve is very slow - it lasts about 30 days in the restframe from the faintest detected data point to the maximum .",
    "then , the decline is also very slow , in a rough agreement with a radioactive decay of co-56 , at least in its early post - peak phase .",
    "such behavior was in the past associated with supernovae of slsn - r type @xcite , however , the suggested pair - instability origin of those slsne was recently questioned by @xcite.they suggest that sne similar to sn2007bi are just a subtype of slsn - i and are well described by a magnetar scenario .",

    "[ fig : oxy ] ) , we are unable to confirm the latter part of the statement . in fig .  [",

    "the place of the sn host galaxy on the absolute magnitude - metallicity plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oxy ] ) is among other hosts with detected slsne .",
    "the presence of slsn usually indicates that the host is undergoing an episode of active star formation .",
    "the extreme luminosity of slsne is the key for their discovery over a range of redshifts , what helps the investigation of star formation in galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "furthermore , the plausible high masses of their progenitors ( in excess of 150 m@xmath71 ) present an opportunity to model the initial mass function in e.g. , low - mass galaxies .",
    "the low host masses of observed slsne would indicate that these objects were produced at the early stages of galactic evolution , which creates a modeling problem to obtain progenitors in such galaxies with consistent metallicity ( see for a comparison ) .    based on our single detection",
    "we can roughly estimate the slsne rate from the sdss data .",
    "the stripe 82 survey covers about 270 square degrees which corresponds to a volume of @xmath8@xmath72 within redshift @xmath73 , a distance to which we are able to detect our slsn .",

    "only one slsn has been detected .",
    "hence , we find that the slsne rate is of order of @xmath76 ( with the assumption of 10 per cent efficiency in sn detection for stripe 82 data , which is low mostly due to non - uniform sdss cadence ) .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of a plausible super - luminous supernova ( slsn ) , found in the archival data of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) stripe 82 , called psn  000123 + 000504 . </S>",
    "<S> the supernova peaked at @xmath0  mag in the second half of september 2005 , but was missed by the real - time supernova hunt . </S>",
    "<S> the observed part of the light curve ( 17 epochs ) showed that the rise to the maximum took over 30 days , while the decline time lasted at least 70 days ( observed frame ) , closely resembling other slsne of sn2007bi type . </S>",
    "<S> spectrum of the host galaxy reveals a redshift of @xmath1 and the distance modulus of @xmath2  mag . combining this information with the sdss photometry </S>",
    "<S> , we found the host galaxy to be an lmc - like irregular dwarf galaxy with the absolute magnitude of @xmath3  mag and the oxygen abundance of @xmath4}=8.3\\pm0.2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> our slsn follows the relation for the most energetic / super - luminous sne exploding in low - metallicity environments , but we found no clear evidence for slsne to explode in low - luminosity ( dwarf ) galaxies only . </S>",
    "<S> the available information on the psn  000123 + 000504 light curve suggests the magnetar - powered model as a likely scenario of this event . </S>",
    "<S> this slsn is a new addition to a quickly growing family of super - luminous sne . </S>"
