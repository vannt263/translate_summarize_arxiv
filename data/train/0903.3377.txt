    "charmless inclusive @xmath0 decays play an important role in our understanding of the standard model and its possible extensions . the inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decay currently allows for the most accurate determination of @xmath6 , one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model , while the inclusive @xmath7 rate is used extensively in constraining models of new physics .",
    "since @xmath8 is much smaller than the @xmath9-quark mass ( @xmath10 ) , one would expect that various physical observables for inclusive @xmath0 decays can be expressed in terms of a local operator product expansion ( ope ) , where the various operators are suppressed by an increasing power of @xmath10 .",
    "this is the case for the partial and total rate of @xmath11 , where schematically we have @xmath12 the current state of the art is that @xmath13 is known at @xmath14 @xcite , while @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite are known at @xmath17 . for @xmath18 , the coefficient of the ",
    "kinetic energy \" operator @xmath19 , is known at @xmath20 @xcite , while @xmath21 , the coefficient of the  chromomagnetic \" operator , is known only at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "for the charmless inclusive @xmath0 decays , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the situation is more complicated .",
    "experimental cuts force the hadronic jet @xmath24 to have large energy @xmath25 , but only moderate invariant mass @xmath26 .",
    "consequently there are three energy scales in the problem : a hard scale ( @xmath27 ) , a hard - collinear scale ( @xmath28 ) and a soft scale ( @xmath29 ) . for this kinematical region",
    ", often called the  end point region \" or  the shape function region \" , the partial rates can be expressed in terms of a non - local ope .",
    "thus , for @xmath30 and the @xmath4 contribution to @xmath31 we have an expansion which is schematically @xcite : @xmath32 where the hard functions ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and the jet functions ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) are calculable in perturbation theory , while the shape functions ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) are non - local light - cone operators which are non perturbative objects , such as @xmath39 , one finds that more complicated factorization theorems hold @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss these contributions in this paper . ] .",
    "factorization theorems such as ( [ eq : nlope ] ) are most conveniently proven using the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "the current state of the art is as follows .",
    "@xmath40 was recently calculated at @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 @xcite is known expression can be extracted from known results in the literature @xcite , as was done in @xcite for a  normalized \" @xmath42 at the scale @xmath43 . ] at @xmath20 .",
    "the leading order jet function @xmath35 is known at @xmath41 @xcite . of the @xmath44 corrections , only the terms of the form @xmath45",
    "are explicitly known at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "therefore the factorization formula was proven only for the leading order term and one of the @xmath44 suppressed terms .",
    "the knowledge of the leading order hard and jet functions at @xmath46 and the @xmath47 terms at @xmath17 ( as well as known , but not properly factorized , @xmath48 and @xmath49 corrections ) was the basis of the precision determination of @xmath6 in @xcite . in order to improve the accuracy even further , one would like to know as much as possible about the properly factorized @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and the @xmath49 corrections , in decreasing order of importance .",
    "what would the calculation of these corrections entail ?    in order to find the least important term , namely the @xmath49 corrections , the heavy - to - light scet currents need to be matched at tree level to fourth order in the scet expansion parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the most important term , namely the @xmath50 corrections , should appear shortly now that the last ingredient , @xmath40 , was calculated at @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the second most important correction is of order @xmath51 . from ( [ eq : nlope ] ) one would naively expect to find three terms which scale like @xmath44 and need to be calculated to @xmath20 : @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( the subscript @xmath55 is implicit ) .",
    "less formally , we expect to find subleading hard , jet and shape functions , respectively .",
    "let us discuss each of these terms .",
    "since the hard functions are products of wilson coefficients extracted in the matching of qcd onto scet , they depend only on kinematical quantities which scale like @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath56 . as such they always scale as @xmath57 in the @xmath44 expansion , so it is clear that terms of the form @xmath58 can not appear at _ any _ order in @xmath59 . in other words ,",
    "subleading hard functions can appear only when they are multiplied by subleading jet or shape functions .",
    "the  subleading shape functions \" ( ssf ) , i.e. terms of the form @xmath54 which arise already at @xmath60 , can be calculated , in principle , at @xmath46 , i.e. both @xmath61 and @xmath62 need to be calculated at @xmath20 . for the former a one loop matching of the scet current to second order is needed , while the calculation of the latter was outlined ( but not explicitly done ! ) in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is to prove that terms of the form @xmath63 , i.e.  subleading jet functions \" ( sjf ) , indeed exist in the factorization formula for inclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "we will first prove the existence of such terms by showing that the partonic @xmath20 terms in the hadronic tensor which are @xmath44 suppressed in the end point region arise from two momentum regions : soft and hard - collinear .",
    "we will then show how the soft region is accounted for by the parton level one loop diagrams of the _ known _",
    "@xmath17 @xmath64 term , and reproduce the hard - collinear region via time order products ( tops ) of subleading scet currents .",
    "after establishing the need for the @xmath65 term , we will calculate the subleading jet functions via the usual two step matching .",
    "in the first step the qcd currents and lagrangian are matched onto scet at tree level and to second order in @xmath52 . in the second step the scet current correlator is matched onto heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite and the subleading jet functions are extracted .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath51 suppressed terms , and the subleading jet functions start at @xmath20 , it is sufficient to consider only the case of tree level matching of qcd onto scet , for which we can use known results from the literature . for this case we will define the subleading jet functions to all orders in @xmath1 , and calculate them explicitly at first order in @xmath1 .",
    "the subleading jet functions contribution is , in some sense , the most important term at order @xmath51 .",
    "when integrating over larger portions of phase space , the one loop subleading jet functions contribution is no longer power suppressed .",
    "the other @xmath51 term in the factorization formula , namely the @xmath20 @xmath64 contribution , although formally @xmath51 suppressed in the end point region , is expected to become even more power suppressed and thus is less important outside of the end point region . in other words , the terms which we will calculate are kinematically and not hadronically suppressed , and as such are important outside of the end point region .",
    "incidentally , experiments are starting to probe the kinematic area outside of the end point region .",
    "finally , since the subleading jet functions appear in convolution with the leading order shape function , their inclusion does not introduce new hadronic uncertainties .",
    "another motivation for studying subleading jet functions is that they arise also outside of the context of flavor physics .",
    "since these functions encode the interaction of hard - collinear quarks and gluons , the same functions are expected to appear in the @xmath66 region of deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a short review of known results in section [ sec : review ] , we calculate in section [ sec : regions ] the partonic @xmath20 terms in the hadronic tensor which are @xmath44 suppressed in the end point region .",
    "we then show that they arise from two momentum regions : soft and hard - collinear . in section [ sec : eft ] we explain how the soft region is accounted for by the parton level one loop diagrams of the _ known _ @xmath64 terms , and reproduce the hard - collinear region via time order products of subleading scet currents . in the main section of the paper , section [ sec : subjet ] ,",
    "we define the subleading jet functions , for the case of a tree level hard function , to all orders in @xmath1 and calculate their one loop expressions .",
    "after a short discussion of their renormalization , we present properly factorized expressions for the decay rates of @xmath3 and the @xmath4 contribution to @xmath5 . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the appendices contain proofs for some of the statements made in section [ sec : subjet ] .",
    "a reader who is mostly interested in the phenomenological results , can skip section [ sec : regions ] and [ sec : eft ] and proceed directly to section [ sec : subjet ] .",

    "the factorization formula can be proven in an analogous way to the leading order factorization proof as presented , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that we have subleading jet functions instead of a leading jet function .",
    "the second issue , which does not arise at leading order , is the  correct \" definition of the subleading jet functions and the role of parity and time reversal ( @xmath222 ) symmetry . in general",
    "the subleading jet function is the discontinuity of top of two _ different _ combinations of hard - collinear fields @xmath223 and @xmath224 . here",
    "@xmath225 can be a hard - collinear quark or a product of hard - collinear quark and a hard - collinear gluon , or even a more complicated object . as a result we typically have both @xmath226 the subleading jet function(s )",
    "should be the discontinuity of the _ sum _ of the two terms . in practice",
    "we find that after we decompose each top according to the different color and lorentz structures , we can use translation invariance and the @xmath222 symmetry of the strong interaction to relate the two tops .",
    "we can therefore define the subleading jet function as the discontinuity of the coefficient of a specific structure in _ either _ top .",
    "we will illustrate both issues in the more detailed calculation of the first subleading jet function .",
    "these details will be suppressed in the derivation of subsequent jet functions .",
    "as before , the one loop calculation are performed in @xmath166 dimensions and we implicitly take @xmath227 .    the following list of the subleading jet functions is not necessarily the complete list of possible subleading jet functions .",
    "for example , if the qcd currents are matched onto scet beyond tree level we would expect more complicated functions which can depend on more than one variable .",
    "we wish to emphasize , though , that the list is sufficient to describe all the terms of the form of equation ( [ eq : fact ] ) at zeroth order in @xmath146 and to all orders in @xmath1 .",

    "<S> we present explicit expressions for the decay rates of @xmath3 and the @xmath4 contribution to @xmath5 , where the subleading jet functions are multiplied by a tree level hard function and appear in a convolution with the leading order shape function . together with the recent two loop calculation of the leading order hard function for @xmath3 , this paper will allow for a more precise description of inclusive @xmath0 decays in the end point region .    </S>",
