    "since the pioneering study by @xcite , one of the major issues in astrophysics is whether the initial mass function ( imf ) , the relationship that specifies the mass distribution of a newly formed stellar population , is universal or , alternatively , determined by environmental effects . in particular , establishing whether the imf has been constant over the evolution of the universe , or if it varies with time ( redshift ) and/or metallicity has crucial consequences on the evolution , surface brightness , chemical enrichment and baryonic content of galaxies , and on the evolution of light and matter in the universe .    due to a number of effects and observational uncertainties such as mass segregation , field star contamination , and variable extinction @xcite ,",
    "the  true \" imf is very difficult to measure . despite these limitations ,",
    "star clusters still provide the best determination of the imf , because they are essentially single  age , single  metallicity stellar systems . in general ,",

    "therefore , in order to perform an accurate census of the initial stellar content it is necessary to focus on the youngest stellar systems .",
    "in addition , young ( age @xmath4 ) star clusters in nearby galaxies ( e.g. the large lmc and small magellanic cloud smc ) offer to us the unique advantage to individually resolve  because of their proximity  statistically significant samples of stars down to the sub  solar mass regime .    in this paper",

    "multiple , deep , images of ngc  346 were obtained during cycle 14 using the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the _ hst_/acs ( go-10248 ; pi a. nota ) .",
    "a detailed description of the observations and of the stellar photometry has been presented in s07 .",

    "the photometric reduction of the images was performed with the daophot package within the iraf environment .",
    "we followed the same methodology applied to r136 @xcite and ngc  330 @xcite and used the psf fitting and aperture photometry routines provided within daophot to derive accurate photometry of all stars in the field ( see s07 for more details ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were corrected for the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) effects that affect acs data , using the parametric correction from @xcite .",
    "the photometric calibration to the vegamag system was performed by converting the magnitudes of the individual stars to an aperture radius of 0.5@xmath25 and applying the zero points listed in @xcite .    a smc field ( @xmath26 00:58:42.5 ; @xmath2772:19:46 )",

    "the data were analyzed following the same procedure described above .",
    "extensive artificial star tests were designed to accurately assess the level of completeness of the photometric data .",

    "the artificial stars were distributed onto the f555w image randomly in magnitude using a step function .",
    "this function extends two magnitudes below the detection limit of our observations in order to probe with sufficient statistics the range of magnitude in which incompleteness is expected to be most severe .",
    "this is a crucial step to assess the robustness of the mf .    in each run",
    "@xmath30 artificial stars were distributed on a regular grid to avoid an unrealistic increase of the crowding conditions in the analyzed frame .",
    "then , the frame to which the artificial stars were added was processed exactly as the original frame .",
    "we determined the level of completeness of the photometry by comparing the list of artificial stars added with the list of the stars recovered . in our experiments",
    "an artificial star is considered recovered if it is found in both f555w and f814w frames with an input - output difference in magnitude @xmath31 , and at the same time satisfying all the photometric selection criteria .",
    "the artificial star experiments show that the completeness is a function of both magnitude and color : our photometry is complete at a 50% level down to magnitude @xmath32 at color @xmath33 . at redder colors ( e.g. @xmath34 ) the photometry is complete at the 50% level only at magnitude @xmath35 ( fig .

    "figure  [ f : cmd ] shows the @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 cmd of all the stars identified in the wfc ngc  346 data with @xmath38 mag .",

    "the narrow subgiant branch ( sgb ) , visible at magnitude @xmath44 , in the color range @xmath45 , indicates that , in the ngc  346 region , the old stellar population is dominated by the presence of the bs90 star cluster .",
    "the presence of sgb stars both fainter and brighter than the bs90 sgb indicates that , in the field , sf occurred before and after the formation of this star cluster .",
    "@xmath39 a young population .",
    "the bright ( @xmath46 ) and blue ( @xmath47 ) ms , well visible to the upper left of the cmd , is the most remarkable feature of the youngest stellar population .",
    "the majority of these stars belong to the cluster ngc  346 , and have an age of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath39 hundreds of pre - ms stars are visible between @xmath48 , below magnitude @xmath40 .",
    "the mf , commonly indicated by @xmath49 , is defined as the fractional number of stars per mass interval per unit area . among the various parameterizations of the mf",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of the most used is the one proposed by @xcite , where the mf is characterized by the logarithmic derivative @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mf , and @xmath52 is its slope . the reference imf , as derived by @xcite for the solar neighborhood , has a slope @xmath53 .",
    "the mf of a system is obtained by counting the number of stars in mass intervals . under the assumption that all the stars of a system formed at the same time , the mf can be derived by counting the number of stars as a function of magnitude ( luminosity function ) , which translates into the number of stars per unit stellar mass by using an appropriate mass - luminosity relation",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , this approach can be applied only to those stars currently on the ms , where the relationship between the luminosity of a star and its mass is reasonably well known , and assumes that all the stars have the same age , and the same metallicity , or , in other words , that we are studying a simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , there is evidence that ngc  346 formed stars over the last 5 myr .",
    "furthermore hundreds of stars in ngc  346 are still in the pre  ms phase ( where their luminosity strongly depends on age ) , and star formation is still ongoing @xcite . for all these reasons we can not model ngc  346 as a perfect ssp . to overcome the age ",
    "luminosity degeneracy which comes from the fact that ngc  346 is not a ssp , we applied the technique presented by @xcite and @xcite , which consists of directly counting the stars between two theoretical evolutionary tracks , according to their position in the herztprung  russell diagram ( hrd ) .",
    "this technique has the advantage of avoiding any assumptions on the age of the stellar population .    because in ngc  346 sf occurred over an interval of time comparable with its age and is still ongoing @xcite",
    ", it is almost impossible to derive its imf without making assumptions on how the star formation rate varies in time , and on the mass distribution of the stars which are currently forming .",
    "for this reason we will focus our attention on the present  day mass function ( pdmf ) of those stars that are already visible in the optical bands , but have not yet evolved off the ms .    to infer the pdmf of ngc  346 , we used two different sets of evolutionary tracks : for stars below 7 m@xmath16 , we adopted pre ",
    "ms stars evolutionary tracks by @xcite , while we used padua evolutionary tracks @xcite for stars above 9 m@xmath16 . in order to minimize the uncertainties due to the photometric conversions",
    ", we transform the evolutionary tracks into the vegamag system by applying the convertions calculated by @xcite .",
    "the adopted evolutionary tracks , superimposed on the @xmath54 vs. @xmath55 cmd , are shown in figure  [ f : cmd ] .",
    "we computed the pdmf between 0.8 and 60 m@xmath16 using the following binning : 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.6 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 , 7.0 , 9.0 , 12.0 , 15.0 , 20.0 , 30.0 , and 60.0 m@xmath16 .    to properly account for the effects of crowding and incompleteness , which varies with both magnitude and color ( e.g. the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f : cmd ] shows the 50% level of completeness of our photometry ) , stars identified between two evolutionary tracks were divided into bins of 0.5 in magnitude and 0.25 in color .",
    "the number of stars identified in each bin was then normalized to the logarithmic width of the mass range spanned by the tracks and to the area of the observed region .",
    "we then applied the appropriate completeness factor .",
    "figure  [ f : mftot]panel ( a ) shows the pdmf obtained with this approach .",
    "the resulting pdmf reflects the composite stellar population in this region . in order to derive the `` true '' pdmf for the ngc 346 cluster , we need to account for the contamination of the old cluster bs90 and of the smc field .",
    "@xmath39 _ the bs90 old cluster_. we used the king model that best fits the stellar density profile of bs90 ( s07 ) to determine , at each spatial position , the expected stellar contribution from bs90 .",
    "we selected the stars that lie within 20 arcsec from the projected center of gravity of bs90 as representative of the old cluster stellar population .",
    "we then scaled the number of stars to the estimated stellar density , and removed them from our pdmf .",
    "we found that @xmath5611% of the stars are likely to belong to bs90 .",
    "figure  [ f : mftot]panel ( b ) shows the pdmf after the subtraction of the contribution from bs90 .",
    "@xmath39 _ the smc field .",
    "_ we used a smc field ( @xmath57 ) , located at a projected distance of @xmath29 from ngc  346 , observed with wfc in the same filters , to remove the contribution of the smc stellar population from our data .",
    "this contribution is important , given that the surface stellar density in this region is @xmath58 stars pc@xmath59 . as we did for ngc  346 , we counted the number of stars lying within two evolutionary tracks , normalized to the logarithmic width of the mass range spanned by the tracks and to the area of the observed region , and then we applied the appropriate completeness factor . then for each mass bin , we subtracted the estimated number of stars belonging to the field from the pdmf of ngc  346 . from the comparison between the reference field and ngc  346 region ,",
    "we can conclude that in ngc  346 region about 54% of the stars below 12 m@xmath16 belong to the smc field .",
    "the final pdmf of ngc  346 , after the subtraction of the smc field and bs90 , is shown in figure  [ f : mftot]panel ( c ) .",
    "a weighted least mean square fits of the data indicates that , between 0.8 and 60 m@xmath16 , the slope of ngc  346 pdmf is @xmath0 , in good agreement with the value derived by salpeter for the imf of the solar neighborhood .",
    "furthermore we note that , as already derived by @xcite , the pdmf is quite steep above 5 m@xmath16 ( we derive a slope @xmath60 ) , and becomes flatter below this value of mass .    some uncertainties still affect the derived slope of the pdmf :    * as @xcite have shown , optical and near ",
    "uv colors only sample the low  frequency tail of the spectral energy distribution of the most massive and hot stars ; as a consequence , optical photometry is not adequate to estimate the pdmf of massive stars , and spectroscopy is necessary . in figure",
    "[ f : mftot](c ) we have compared our derived pdmf with that published by @xcite ( open triangles ) : we found a very good agreement in the overlapping range of masses below 20 m@xmath16 .",
    "as expected , on the basis of photometry alone , we underestimate the masses of the most massive stars .",
    "* the presented pdmf does not take into account uncertainties due to unresolved binary systems , which may be important . in the orion nebula cluster , for example ,",
    "each massive star has , on average , 1.5 companions @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that , if each star in the mass range 2 to 14 m@xmath16 has one companion , the average imf slope they derived for five young clusters in the lmc would change from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "this correction , however , depends on the distribution of the companions , which is not yet well - known @xcite .",
    "a spectroscopic survey of ngc  346 , carried on with the fiber large array multi  element spectrograph ( flames ) instrument at the very large telescope ( vlt ) , indicates a binary fraction of @xmath63% for the most massive stars ( @xmath64 , * ? ? ?",
    "the derivation of the pdmf requires an accurate knowledge of the amount of extinction .",
    "the foreground extinction to the smc is low , and the only appreciable presence of gas and dust along the line of sight of ngc  346 is likely associated with the star  forming region itself .",
    "a visual inspection of the region shows that dust and gas are not uniformly distributed , but detailed reddening maps for the region are not yet available . *",
    "the real slope of the mf can be altered by an inaccurate subtraction of contaminating field stars : dust and gas for example can obscure field stars , causing an over subtraction of the low  mass stars , and a flatter mf .",
    "local differences in the stellar density or in the distance dispersion between the analyzed region and the reference field may also artificially alter the shape of the mf ( see  [ radialmf ] ) . *",
    "a major source of uncertainty comes from the pre  ms evolutionary tracks , which do not yet well represent observations ( see for example the discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high spatial resolution and the depth of our photometric data have allowed us to study in detail the spatial variations of the pdmf within ngc  346 .",
    "already a cursory inspection of the image shows that the brightest stars are found in the central region .",
    "does this imply that the most massive stars are concentrated in the cluster center ?    to answer this question ,",
    "we have calculated the variation of the mass function with projected distance from the ngc  346 center . in order to determine the position of the projected center of gravity of ngc  346 we first selected the stars belonging to the young ms ( defined by magnitude @xmath36 brighter than 21.0 and colors @xmath65 bluer than 0.4 ) .",
    "then we drew a circle with a radius of 50 pixel around each star and counted the number of stars falling within each circle .",
    "we computed the weighted average of the ms stars @xmath66 and @xmath67 coordinates , using the sum of the stars within each circle as weight .",
    "the position we obtained for the stellar association is @xmath68 $ ] , with a 1@xmath69 uncertainty in both @xmath66 and in @xmath67 of @xmath70 , that corresponds to about 25 pixels in the hst / wfc images .    to study the spatial variations of the pdmf , we divided the region in four annuli , at radial distances from the center r@xmath71 4.00 , 9.00 ( which corresponds to the half mass radius ) , 14.00 , and 19.80 pc ( fig .",
    "[ f : mappa_n346 ] ) .",
    "less than 2.6 stars / pc@xmath72 belong to ngc  346 outside @xmath73 from the center .",
    "pdmfs derived for annuli 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are shown in figure  [ f : mfrad ] , and the corresponding slopes , as a function of the distance from the center , are shown in fig  [ f : esp ] . in the innermost region the pdmf appears quite flat , with @xmath74 ( fig  [ f : mfrad ] ) .",
    "it becomes steeper moving from the center to the periphery , where its exponent becomes @xmath75 .",
    "we applied a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( k  s ) test to verify the significance of the differences found between the pdmf obtained in the innermost annulus ( annulus # 1 ) and those derived for the other three annuli .",
    "according to the k  s test , the probability that the pdmfs derived in annuli 2 , 3 , and 4 are drawn from the parent distribution of the pdmf in the innermost annulus is 3.9% , 0.3% , and 0.06% respectively .",
    "therefore , we can safely exclude that regions 3 and 4 are drawn from the same parent distribution of region 1 .",
    "the projected density of massive stars from the innermost annulus to the periphery decreases by a factor of 60 , whereas low - mass stars are depleted only by a factor of 6 , indicating that the change in the pdmf slope is due to a lack of massive stars in the periphery , rather than an excess of low mass stars there .",
    "a similar trend was observed in orion nebula cluster ( onc ) .",
    "discussing the excess of massive stars in the center of the onc @xcite pointed out that mass distribution could be biased by an age effect , with the most massive stars also being the youngest .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for ngc  346 : spectroscopic analysis by @xcite have demonstrated that , even if a spread of about 5 myr in the ages of ngc  346 stars is present , stars of different ages appear uniformly distributed over the whole cluster , and sst infrared observations indicate that there is ongoing sf throughout the complex with a lower limit on the star formation rate of @xmath76 @xcite .    as already mentioned in  [ mf ] , dust and gas can obscure field stars , and this may cause an over subtraction of the low  mass stars , resulting in a flatter mf . to exclude the possibility that the spatial variation of the mf can be totally ascribed to variations in the gas and dust densities , we derived the mf of the innermost region also under the assumption that the contamination from the smc field is negligible , and in this case we obtained a value for @xmath77 .",
    "we also estimated the surface stellar density necessary to obtain the same mf slope in the innermost region that we find for the outermost one . in order to obtain a slope of @xmath78 we should observe a stellar density of @xmath79 star pc@xmath59 between @xmath80 , which is almost a factor of 2 higher than the observed value",
    "; such a high stellar density makes it unlikely that the derived variation can be ascribed only to a poor subtraction of the smc field .      as for many other young star clusters , ngc  346 shows a shallower pdmf in its central region .",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether the segregation of the most massive stars in young clusters is due to evolutionary effects , or instead is due to the initial conditions of the cluster formation . in the first case the most massive stars form elsewhere in the cluster and",
    "then sink to the center through dynamical interactions with the numerous low - mass stars . on the contrary , if the mass segregation is due to initial conditions , then it reflects how the cluster formed .",
    "as discussed by s07 , ngc  346 shows a very complex morphology , with the stars assembled in many coeval sub  clusters . due to the lack of information on the dynamics of the sub ",
    "clusters , at zero order we can consider all the stars in ngc  346 as members of an individual star cluster .",
    "thus , to understand whether the mass segregation found in ngc  346 is primordial or not , we can compare its age with its mass segregation timescale ( @xmath81 ) , defined as @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the relaxation time of the cluster , @xmath84 is the average stellar mass and @xmath85 is the mass of the most massive star @xcite .",
    "for ngc  346 we found @xmath86 yr ( values used to derive the @xmath81 are listed in table  [ table ] ) , one order of magnitude larger than the age of ngc  346 , supporting the idea that the observed segregation of the massive stars is likely due to initial conditions , rather than dynamical evolution .",
    "it has been suggested that ngc  346 is probably the result of the collapse and subsequent fragmentation of the initial giant molecular cloud into multiple `` seeds '' of sf .",
    "the fact that the observed subclusters appear almost coeval , and that many of them appear to be connected by arcs of dust and gas , seems to be a good observational match to the conditions predicted by the hierarchical fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud model @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the fact that the various `` seeds '' of star formation are still distinguishable would imply that ngc  346 is not completely relaxed , and that the majority of the stars would be still close to their birth positions .",
    "also in this case the observed mass segregation would be primordial and would represent a feature of the way the cluster is forming .",
    "the magellanic clouds differ from the milky way in a variety of ways , including their mass densities , tidal fields , chemical abundances , and experiences with recent external perturbations .",
    "both the magellanic clouds also are well known for their large populations of relatively massive star clusters : densities of host galaxies and the densities of their star forming sites evidently are not simply related . in the smc",
    "the star formation process on large spatial scales itself differs from that in the galaxy , more likely being a result of cloud - cloud interactions @xcite and the turbulent generation of self - gravitating structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some regions this",
    "may be further enhanced through the formation of dense shells and supershells which are sites for further star formation @xcite .",
    "thus the smc , with its low metallicity and externally driven star formation in a gas  rich system , provides insights into the development of stellar populations in small pre  galactic systems .",
    "the form of the stellar imf in the smc has implications for a wide range of studies .",
    "the imf has been studied for higher mass stars in the smc : the derived slopes are in good agreement with the values obtained , in similar ranges of masses , in the mw ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , existing investigations of the imf down to 1  m@xmath7 yield salpeter - like imf slopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus while the star formation process might be somehow affected by the conditions of the local interstellar medium , evidently the change in conditions between the smc and spirals has not significantly affected the imf .",
    "most of the stellar mass resides in stars with m@xmath871  m@xmath7 .",
    "thus our extension of the lower limit for the pdmf in ngc  346 to 0.8  m@xmath7 in this study adds further support to the overall normalcy of the imf .",
    "since this result comes from one major star forming complex , our data further suggest that this `` normal '' imf is imprinted during major formation processes .    on a smaller spatial scale , environment ,",
    "however , does appear to matter _ within _ the ngc  346 complex .",
    "consistent with the @xcite work on ngc  330 in the smc we find that while the overall pdmf in ngc  346 follows a salpeter form , there are significant local variations .",
    "the ngc  346 complex offers , therefore , an ideal opportunity to characterize the occurrence and the nature of the local variations",
    ". this will be the objective of future work .",
    "our analysis of the stellar content of ngc  346 indicates that , within all the uncertainties that can affect the determination of a mf , the pdmf slope of ngc 346 , at least down to the solar mass regime , is consistent with the value derived by @xcite for the imf in the solar neighborhood , further confirming that the stellar mf does not strongly depend on the metallicity , or the mass or morphological type of the parent galaxy .",
    "we studied how the pdmf varies as a function of the distance from the center of ngc  346 .",
    "we found that the pdmf is quite flat in the center , and becomes steeper in the periphery .",
    "as already found in other young star clusters @xcite the increase in the mf slope with the distance from the center is due to the lack of massive stars in the periphery rather than an excess of low ",
    "mass objects there .",
    "the projected density of massive stars from the innermost annulus and the outskirts decreases by a factor of 60 , whereas low - mass stars are depleted only by a factor of 6 ; the most massive stars are segregated in the center .",
    "we conclude that the spatial stellar mass distribution is unlikely to be biased by age effects .",
    "sst observations indicate that there is ongoing sf throughout the complex with a lower limit on the total star formation rate of @xmath76 @xcite . furthermore @xcite noted a spread of about 5 myr in the ages of ngc  346 stars , but did not find any correlation between the age and the position of the stars over the whole cluster .",
    "s07 noted that stars in ngc  346 appear to be organized in several coeval sub ",
    "clusters , embedded in hii gas , and coinciding with the co clumps analyzed by @xcite .",
    "ysos between class i and class iii are found in 14 of the 16 identified sub ",
    "cluster @xcite .",
    "clusters are also connected by filaments and arcs of gas and dust .",
    "the complex structure of ngc  346 and its young age , compared to its dynamical time , suggest that ngc  346 is not dynamically evolved , and probably not yet relaxed .",
    "on the basis of these considerations we conclude that the observed segregation of the most massive stars is likely primordial , and reflects how the cluster formed .",
    "s07 suggested that in ngc  346 most of the star formation was likely not triggered , but rather resulted from the turbulence driven density variations within a giant interstellar cloud complex , conditions predicted by the hierarchical fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud model @xcite . according to this model , the fragmentation of the cloud is due to supersonic turbulent motions present in the gas .",
    "the turbulence induces the formation of shocks in the gas , and produces filamentary structures @xcite .",
    "the chaotic nature of the turbulence increases locally the density in the filamentary structures . when regions of high density become self  gravitating",
    ", they start to collapse to form stars .",
    "simulations show that star formation occurs simultaneously at several different locations in the cloud @xcite , as appears to be the case for ngc  346 .    in this scenario , stars forming near the cluster center would have higher accretion rates , due to the local higher gas density @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite indicate that although low  mass stars form equally well throughout the entire cluster , the most massive stars are almost exclusively segregated to the central regions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two most massive stars ( one of them being an o3v spectral type , figs .",
    "[ f : centro ] ) are @xmath88 off the center of the cluster ( outside the core of ngc  346 , but still within the half mass radius ) . did these stars form where they are observed today , in a quite low stellar density region ?",
    "@xcite studied the effect of strong stellar winds and photoionizing fluxes coming from o- and b - type stars on the gas content in a young star cluster . according to their simulations ,",
    "the gas expulsion is unlikely to remove any initial mass segregation , but it can still result in the ejection of some of the most massive stars to positions outside the cluster core , although still within the half mass radius . according to @xcite mechanical power from o - star winds",
    "is not a dominant factor in the evolution within n66 , but the molecular gas in the original cloud has been strongly photodissociated and photoionized by the o stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the radial velocity of five of the innermost and brightest stars in ngc  346 , and found a velocity dispersion of @xmath89 , indicating that , even in @xmath13 , they can be formed in the center of the cluster and then ejected where they are observed today .",
    "another possibility is that these stars formed where are observed , as the result of a very efficient competitive accretion process into a potential well @xcite .",
    "further spectroscopic analysis of the dynamics of the gas and the sub  clusters can confirm whether the giant molecular cloud which formed ngc  346 underwent under a hierarchical fragmentation .",
    "the initial supersonic turbulence originates shocks in the gas which rapidly remove kinetic energy from the gas @xcite : in this case we expect to find low gas velocities around the sub",
    " clusters .",
    "a detailed study of the sub  clusters dynamics will also reveal if ngc  346 is or is not already relaxed and virialized .",
    "we will present these results in a future paper .",
