    "higher - order contributions give more non - local corrections to the effective euler - lagrange equation for the chiral field , and the condition for the validity of the method is a smooth variation of the chiral field , which should be enough in the analysis of its long - wavelength behavior in the phase transition .    incorporating the first inhomogeneity correction in the computation of the effective potential of the linear @xmath0-model coupled to quarks , we found that the latter is significantly modified . besides a general smoothening of the potential , the critical temperature moves upward and the hight of the barrier separating the symmetric and the broken phase vacua diminishes appreciably . as a direct consequence ,",
