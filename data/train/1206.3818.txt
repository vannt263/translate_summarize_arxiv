    "with the technologic development in the micro - integration of electronic devices , the heat generation problem has sharply emerged .",
    "this increasing thermal generation greatly influences the performance and stability of nanoscale electronic devices , and it becomes a main bottleneck for the future advancement of electronic industry .",
    "furthermore , some familiar concepts of heat generation that are applicable in macroscopic systems may not be valid in nanoscale systems .",
    "so there is an imperative need to comprehend fully the heating effect and to try to mitigate it .",
    "owing to difficulties in probing the heating process in nanostructures , not much progress had been made until several state - of - the - art experimental scenarios were conceived in recent years .",
    "@xcite there are both indirect @xcite and direct @xcite methods , which enable the evaluation of the effective local temperatures of nanoscale junctions . it has been experimentally demonstrated that the local heating may induce a substantial temperature increase in single molecular junctions @xcite because of the inefficient heat dissipation . from a microscopic point of view , the main factor of heat generation is the electron - phonon ( e - p ) interaction , which transfers the ordered energy of electric current to the disordered vibrational energy of atoms . in some recent measurements of differential conductance , phonon - assisted tunnelling peaks have been observed in various nano - devices ( e.g. @xmath0 , carbon nanotube , etc . ) , @xcite these clearly show the existence of e - p interaction . as for the aspect of theory , on the one hand much efforts have been made to investigate the effects of inelastic e - p scattering on electronic transport through different nanostructures , @xcite on the other hand many theoretical works have devoted to understanding the phenomena of heat , various models and methods",
    "were suggested as well .",
    "@xcite by using the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method , a tractable formula of heat generation has been derived .",
    "@xcite but these works mainly focused on the steady - state cases or , at most , the sinusoidal - like ac bias .",
    "in order to analyze the transient heat generation and its dynamics , the step - like and the square - shaped pulse biases are considered as the optimal driving forces .",
    "@xcite it is not only because they can provide the unambiguous time scales and the transient behaviours of heat generation , but also because any information in computers is presented in bytes that consist of a long series of 0and1digits , they are realized by continuously switching on and off the sharp step pulse .    in this paper",
    ", we study the transient behaviours of heat generation in a quantum dot ( qd ) system driven by a step - like or a square - shaped pulse bias .",
    "the qd is described by the anderson model and the intra - dot e - p interaction is considered . by using the negf method ,",
    "the transient heat generation is derived .",
    "we find a sudden bias inducing a periodically oscillating heat generation .",
    "moreover , it can give rise to an energy transfer from the zero - temperature phonon subsystem to the electronic subsystem under certain conditions .",
    "however , after the bias goes back to zero and the system restores the equilibrium , the total heat generation at zero - temperature is always positive because of the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "in addition , we also discuss how to operate the qd with as little heat generation as possible .",

    "[ section_4 ] .",
    "to begin with , we consider a single - level qd connecting to two electrode - leads and coupling to a local vibronic phonon mode .",
    "the whole system is described by the typical hamiltonian : @xcite @xmath1 \\hat{n}_d + { \\epsilon_d } \\hat{n}_d \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\alpha , k}{\\epsilon_{{\\alpha}k}(t)}\\hat{c}_{{\\alpha}k}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{{\\alpha}k } + \\sum_{\\alpha , k}{t_{\\alpha}}[\\hat{c}_{{\\alpha}k}^{\\dagger}\\hat{d } + \\mathrm{h}.\\mathrm{c}. ] .",

    "is an annihilation ( creation ) operator for one specific vibronic mode with frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the strength of the e - p interaction is described by the coupling constant @xmath13 .    due to the pulse bias , the electronic level @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ original_hamiltonian ] ) is time - dependent : @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represents the external time - dependent bias potential . for the step - like pulse case ,",
    "we assume that the system is initially in equilibrium under the zero bias ; at @xmath16 a bias @xmath17 is suddenly switched on and remains for @xmath18 , which drives the system out of equilibrium , induces the electric current and then generates heat . following we study the transient heat generation for @xmath18 .",
    "hereafter we consider that the bias is applied solely on the left lead , so @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 otherwise .    in what follows , it is rewarding to make a canonical transformation on the hamiltonian @xmath23 , with the unitary operator @xmath24 $ ] : @xmath25 , \\label{transformed_hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the renormalized electronic level of the qd , and the operator @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we use the general formula of transient heat generation presented in ref .  , which remains unchange under the canonical transformation : @xmath28",
    "next we replace the operator @xmath29 by its expectation value @xmath30 $ ] , which is reasonable under the conditions of both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite after this approximation , the electron and the phonon subsystems are decoupled .",
    "so we can rigorously employ the wick s theorem to deal with the two - particle green s function : @xmath33{\\rangle}_{\\bar{h } } = { \\langle}t_c[\\hat{n}_d(t)]{\\rangle}_{\\bar{h } } { \\langle }   t_c[\\hat{n}_d(t_1)]{\\rangle}_{\\bar{h } } - { \\langle}t_c[\\hat{d}^{\\dagger}(t)\\hat{d}(t_1)]{\\rangle}_{\\bar{h } } { \\langle } t_c[\\hat{d}^{\\dagger}(t_1)\\hat{d}(t)]{\\rangle}_{\\bar{h}}$ ] .",

    "( [ reduced_heat_hamiltonian][quantity_a ] ) , the transient heat generation @xmath34 can be calculated for arbitrary time - dependent bias @xmath15 .",
    "once @xmath34 is known , the total heat generation @xmath51 from @xmath52 to the time @xmath53 is straightforwardly obtained as : @xmath54 .",
    "concretely , by taking into account of the step - like pulse bias , @xmath47 is to be simplified : @xmath55 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\exp[{\\mathrm{i}(\\epsilon+v-\\tilde{\\epsilon}_d + \\mathrm{i}\\widetilde{\\gamma})t } ] .",

    "+    fig .  [ figure_1](a ) shows the transient heat generation @xmath34 versus the time @xmath53 with fixed @xmath59 and different renormalized level @xmath60 .",
    "while @xmath57 , the bias is zero and the system is in equilibrium , so one always has @xmath61 . at @xmath52 , the bias is suddenly added , then the current @xmath62 and the heat generation @xmath34 emerge at @xmath63 . @xmath34 displays a periodically oscillating behaviour with the period @xmath64 .",
    "the oscillation is undamped and keeps all along due to only a discrete phonon model being considered here .",
    "@xmath34 is positive in one half period and negative in other half period , which means that the transporting electron periodically emits and absorbs phonon . besides , the oscillating amplitude is sensitive to @xmath60 , it is the largest while @xmath65 because of the occurrence of resonant tunnelling with the largest current for that @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath60 deviates from zero , the oscillating amplitude reduces and gradually approaches zero .",
    "next we fix the level @xmath66 and investigate the behaviours of @xmath34 with different bias @xmath17 . for the positive bias @xmath17",
    ", @xmath34 is positive in the pre - half period and negative in the post - half period .",
    "but for the negative @xmath17 , @xmath34 can be negative in the pre - half period [ see the region of @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ figure_1](b ) ] .",
    "this result is surprising and indicates that the suddenly - added bias causes the phonon to be transferred from the phonon subsystem to the electronic subsystem at once .",
    "notice that the temperature of the system has been set equal to zero , so it means the phonon population can be _ less _ than the original zero - t value . with @xmath68 increasing , the oscillating amplitude of @xmath34 also increases .",
    "for the positive-@xmath69 half period , the amplitude increase is very prominent .",
    "but for the negative-@xmath69 half period , the amplitude increase is small , and even decreases for the large @xmath68 .",
    "so in the case of large @xmath68 ( @xmath70 ) , more phonons are emitted than absorbed , which leads to a net heat generation by the current .    in fig .",
    "[ figure_1](c ) , the total heat generation @xmath51 is shown .",
    "because of the oscillating @xmath34 , @xmath51 also exhibits the oscillating property with time @xmath53 . for the small bias ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath51 oscillates along a horizontal line , in which case there is no net heat generation .",
    "but for the large bias ( @xmath70 ) , an ascending trend will grow more and more noticeably , by considering the large time scale , @xmath51 is approximately proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , as for @xmath72 , the curves of @xmath51 always lie below the zero point [ see the curves with @xmath73 and @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ figure_1](c ) ] , which means that at any time there is a net phonon absorption from the zero - t phonon subsystem .",
    "intuitively , this seems to be impossible .",
    "but in fact , due to the e - p interaction , the equilibrium phonon population @xmath75 at @xmath21 is not zero , but a finite value even if @xmath39 . by using the negf method and taking the same approximation as in the derivation of @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath76 can be calculated .",
    "it is a function of @xmath60 behaving like the occupation number of electron on the qd , and we will mention it later in this paper ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] ) .",
    "then by choosing the same parameters in fig .",
    "[ figure_1](c ) , @xmath76 is about @xmath77 . from the above results , we find that the suddenly - applied bias can transfer a part of energy of such @xmath76 phonons from the original zero - t phonon subsystem to the electronic subsystem . due to the system at @xmath63 being in non - equilibrium",
    ", this transfer is not prohibited in principle .",
    "furthermore , we have already checked that the total heat absorption @xmath78 from the phonon subsystem does not exceed the value of @xmath79 in any case .",
    "the response of transient electric current @xmath62 to the sudden pulse bias is also shown in fig .  [ figure_1](d ) , in which @xmath62 quickly rises in a very short time .",
    "the rising time scale of @xmath62 is about @xmath80 .",
    "however , the rise of @xmath34 is within the time scale @xmath81 .",
    "so if we set the parameter @xmath82 , the current @xmath62 will emerge much quicker than @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", the device can finish the operation before the occurrence of heat generation .",
    "additionally , in comparison with @xmath34 , 1 ) @xmath62 is without oscillation and quickly damps to a stable value because of the spectrum of electronic reservoirs ( lead @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) being continuous , 2 ) @xmath62 has the electron - hole symmetry [ e.g. @xmath85 , but @xmath86 , it is because that the phonon subsystem is without the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "+    up to now , we have only considered a single isolated phonon mode @xmath12 in the qd .",
    "but for a real device , the qd usually couples to the lead and the substrate , so the phonon mode @xmath12 will unavoidably acquire a small line width .",
    "this is to be considered in the following discussion with the phonon subsystem having a lorentzian spectrum : @xmath87 now the oscillations of @xmath34 and @xmath51 gradually damp as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] .",
    "@xmath34 damps to a finite positive value for @xmath88 or almost zero for @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath51 damps along a slanting line for @xmath88 or a horizontal line for @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath51 is negative after the system reaches a new steady state at the large time @xmath53 [ see the curves with @xmath73 and @xmath93 in fig .  [ figure_2](b ) ] .",
    "it means that , in the process of applying the sudden bias , a net energy transfer from the phonon subsystem to the electronic subsystem occurs .",
    "the phonon population @xmath76 in the new steady state is less than that of the original zero - t case and it can keep this value for a very long time because of @xmath92 . to pay attention ,",
    "the system is now in the steady state , not in equilibrium .",
    "so @xmath76 being less than the original zero - t value does not indicate that its temperature is lower than @xmath94 , and this result does not breach the third law of thermodynamics either .",
    "+     +    in order to further explain and comprehend the phenomenon of heat absorption from the phonon subsystem at zero temperature , we have calculated the occupation number of zero - t phonon , @xmath76 , and the occupation number of electron , @xmath95 , in both equilibrium state and steady state : @xmath96 , \\label{nph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 \\widetilde{g}^a(\\epsilon)$ ] , @xmath98\\ } \\widetilde{g}^a(\\epsilon)$ ] , and @xmath99 + 1\\}$ ] ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] , the occupation number of phonon behaves much like that of electron , which monotonically decreases with the elevated renormalized level of the qd , that is to say , @xmath76 is approximately proportional to @xmath100 while changing @xmath60 . at @xmath57",
    ", there is no bias across the qd ( @xmath101 ) , so the whole system is in equilibrium . after applying the sudden bias ,",
    "the system is driven out of equilibrium , until a large time , enters a new steady state ( @xmath102 ) . as we can see , both the phonon population @xmath76 and the electron population @xmath95 experience an obvious falling down from the equilibrium - state case to the steady - state case , it means that a part of zero - t phonons have indeed run away , which results in the heat absorption . to be specific",
    ", for @xmath65 , the change of the average phonon number at zero temperature is about @xmath103 , and the corresponding phonon energy is @xmath104 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the net heat absorption @xmath105 in real case will be a little less than this value , in that the electric current can also transfer energy to the phonon subsystem as an offset [ see the approached level of @xmath106 with @xmath93 in fig .  [ figure_2](b ) ] .",
    "finally , we deal with the square - shaped pulse bias @xmath107 , in which case @xmath107 suddenly goes back to @xmath94 at @xmath108 .",
    "[ figure_4 ] shows @xmath34 and @xmath51 for the lorentzian - spectrum phonon subsystem with different @xmath109 and @xmath17 .",
    "while the bias going back to @xmath94 , @xmath34 and @xmath51 show strong oscillations once again , which will gradually fade away . in the limit of ( @xmath110 ) ,",
    "the system restores the equilibrium as initial , @xmath34 and @xmath51 approaches zero and a finite positive value respectively . for @xmath111",

    "but for @xmath113 , @xmath112 is almost zero regardless of @xmath109 .",
    "so if the device is operated in that range of @xmath68 , there will not be much net heat generation .",
    "in particular , as discussed above , for @xmath114 , @xmath51 can be negative after the first pulse bias , but @xmath106 is eventually @xmath115 when the system recovers the equilibrium state .",

    "we find that the suddenly switched - on bias can induce a heat absorption from the zero - temperature phonon subsystem . for a strong qd - lead coupling case ,",
    "the current - rising process is much quicker than the heat generation , so the device can finish the electronic operation before the emergence of heat generation .",
