    "functional reduction is not new to the sciences ; functional reduction , specifically , of probability , is not new to philosophy . in any moderately serious form of physical realism",
    "a world is a system of actual events , arranged in a spatiotemporal array , defined in terms of objective , physical properties and relations alone .",
    "where in all this are the physical probabilities ? for physicalists , they can only be grounded on the actual structure of events - what lewis has called a ` humean tapestry ' of events ( lewis [ 1986a xv - xvi ] ) , whereupon the same identificatory project ensues as in eqm )  ` of instrumental frivolity , of doublethinking deviant logic , and  most of all  of supernatural tales about the power of the observant mind to make things jump ' .",
    "quantum mechanics has certainly been purified in eqm . ] .",
    "the links ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) stand in need of explanation whatever the physics , classical or quantum , one world or many .",
    "for the most part they have remained surprisingly hard to explain , even , and perhaps especially , in one - world theories . ) . ]    but _ one _ of the three links , in the case of one - world theories , _ is _ easily explained  namely ( iii ) , the link with uncertainty .",
    "only allow that the dynamics is indeterministic ( whether in a fundamental or effective sense ) , so that some kinds of events in the future are ( at least effectively ) unpredictable , then , for the denizens of that world , the future will in some respects at least be uncertain .",
    "this is how all the conventional theories of chance explain ( iii ) ( with varying strengths of ` unpredictability ' ) . but according to eqm all outcomes exist , and , we may as well suppose , are known to exist ( we may suppose we know the relevant branching structure of the wave - function )  so the future is completely known . there is no uncertainty on this score .",
    "this marks out eqm  as facing a particular difficulty with ( iii ) , the link with uncertainty , a difficulty encountered by none of the familiar theories of probability in physics .",
    "it has seemed so severe , in fact , that not only do the majority of critics of eqm believe that as a theory of probability it must rest on the links ( i ) with statistics and ( ii ) rationality alone ( if it is to mean anything ) , but so do many of its friends . , greaves [ 2004 ] , [ 2007 ] , deutsch [ 1999 , 2010 ] . ]",
    "the attempt to ground eqm on ( i ) and ( ii ) alone , disavowing all talk of probability or uncertainty , has been dubbed the _ fission programme_. this article is intended as a counterbalance , and is skewed towards a defense of ( iii ) , the link with uncertainty . as i shall argue in section 3 and 4 , the status of this link is not in fact so different in eqm than in conventional theories of chance , using a possible - worlds analysis , of a sort familiar to philosophers .",
    "i have less to say on ( i ) and ( ii ) , not because they are less important to the overall argument , but because arguments for them are either well - known ( in the case of ( i ) , the link with statistics ) or given elsewhere in this volume ( by wallace , for ( ii ) , the principal principle ) .",
    "both links now appear to be in significantly better shape in eqm  than in the other main theories of physical probability ( classical statistical mechanics , deterministic hidden variable theories , and stochastic physical theories ) , none of which offer comparably detailed explanations of ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "instead they presuppose them .    first ( i ) , the link with statistics .",
    "a first step was the demonstration that a largely formal condition of adequacy could be met : a quantum version of the bernouilli ( ` law of large numbers ' ) theorem could be derived ) . ] .",
    "this says that in the limit of large numbers of trials , the probability of relative frequencies different from the predicted probabilities goes to zero .",
    "but this theorem follows from the rules of probability .",
    "distinctive , in eqm , is that given an account of what chance processes /textitactually are ( branchings ) , and given that in eqm we can model any measurement process as comprehensively as we please ( including ` the observer ' if need be ) it becomes a purely _ _  dynamical _ _ question as to whether and how branch amplitudes can be measured .",
    "i will give some illustrative examples in section 2  but i take these arguments to be relatively uncontroversial .    not so the arguments for ( ii ) , the decision theory link .",
    "but even here , few would deny that there has been progress  and on two quite separate fronts , both involving the principal principle : the first ( the sense already suggested ) in showing why credence should track chance , as identified in our everettian tapestry ; the second in showing how we could have been led , by rational , empirical methods , to anything like that tapestry in the first place .",
    "for the former argument , see wallace [ 2010 , 2012 ] , deriving the principal principle .",
    "was the first .",
    "see e.g. zurek [ 2005 ] , for a derivation from locality , or saunders [ 2004 , 2005 ] , for a derivation from operational and invariance principles respectively ; another notable [ and greatly neglected ] derivation was given by lubkin [ 1979 ] ( my thanks to ted jacobson for pointing this out to me . ]",
    "he shows that branching structures and the squared moduli of the amplitudes , insofar as they are known , _ ought _ to play the same decision theory role ( ii ) that chances play , insofar as they are known , in one - world theories .",
    "whatever one might think of wallace s axioms , as long as nothing underhand or sneaky is going on the result is already a milestone : nothing comparable has been achieved for any other physical theory of chance .",
    "it is , however , limited to the context of agents who believe the world has the branching structure eqm says it has ",
    "it is a solution to the ` practical problem ' , the normative problem of how agents who believe they live in a branching universe ought to achieve their ends ( without any prior assumption about probability ) .",
    "it has no direct role in confirming or disconfirming eqm as one of a number of rival physical theories by agents uncommitted as to its truth .",
    "it leaves the ` evidential problem ' unsolved .",
    "but on this front too there has been progress .",
    "greaves [ 2007 ] and greaves and myrvold [ 2010 ] showed how confirmation theory ( specifically bayesian confirmation theory ) can be generalized so as to apply to branching theories and non - branching theories evenhandedly , without empirical prejudice .",
    "the latter proved a representation theorem on the basis of axioms that are entirely independent of quantum mechanics .",
    "nor , in keeping with the fission programme , do they make explicit or even tacit appeal to the notion of probability or uncertainty .",
    "wallace s axioms were likewise intended to apply even in the context of the fission programme . if acceptable that shows the argument for ( ii ) is independent of ( iii ) .",
    "but if the argument for ( iii ) ( with ( i )  and ( ii ) ) goes through , then the present approach _ also _ promises a solution to the evidential problem . as an objection to the everett interpretation",
    ", the problem only arises if it is granted that branching and branch amplitudes can not be identified with chance and probabilities ( which we take to mean are not in fact quantities that satisfy ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) ) , precisely the point here in contention .",
    "show that they can , and the evidential problem simply dissolves . or rather , since it can be read as a problem for every chance theory , it will have the same status in the everett interpretation as it has in any other physical theory of chance , to all of which the greaves and myrvold analysis applies .",
    "i have little more to say about ( ii ) , the decision - theory link .",
    "what follows is directed to ( i ) , the link with statistics ( section 2 ) , but mainly to ( iii ) , the link with uncertainty . , [ 2013 ] . ]    in section 3 i show how branching in eqm is consistent with talk of uncertainty ( following saunders and wallace [ 2008a ] ) .",
    "that is arguably enough , with the results of section 2 and in decision theory , to draw our main conclusion : branching in eqm should be identified with chancing , and mod - squared branch amplitudes with chance .",
    "but there remains a contrary reading , according to which there is no place for uncertainty after all  or not of the right kind .",
    "given sufficient knowledge of the wave - function , on this contrary reading uncertainty can at best concern _ present _ states of affairs , not future ones .",
    "in the final and more philosophical section i  argue that the difference boils down to a choice of metaphysics , a choice that is under - determined by the mathematical structure of the theory . since choices like this should be made to help in the understanding of a physical theory , rather than to frustrate it , the contrary reading should be rejected .",
    "here are a number of no - go facts about how physical probabilities are observed that we believe to be true , but that seem very difficult to explain on any conventional theory of physical probability :    1 .",
    "there is no probability meter that can measure single - case chance with chance equal to one .",
    "2 .   there is no probability meter that can measure chance on repeated trials with chance equal to one .",
    "3 .   there is no probability meter that can measure single - case chance with chance _ close _ to one .",
    "absolute probability can never be measured , only relative probability .",
    "( the list could be continued . )    on conventional thinking , someone who needs convincing of these facts about chance has not so much failed to understood a physical theory as the _ concept _ of probability .",
    "but if chance is a definite physical magnitude , it should ( at least indirectly ) be measurable , like anything else . given the dynamics , and a theory complete enough to model the experimental process itself , these facts should be explained . and",
    "indeed no non - trivial function of the branch amplitudes can be measured in the ways mentioned in ( a)-(d ) , according to eqm .",
    "this is a _ dynamical _ claim .    on the positive side , as to how ( we know ) chances are in practice measured :    1 .",
    "there are probability meters that measure chances on repeated trials ( perhaps simultaneous trials ) with chance close to one .",
    "this is conventionally thought of as a consequence of the axioms of probability ( the law of large numbers , or bernouilli theorem ) rather than of any physical theory ; in turning it around , and deriving it rather from the dynamical equations of eqm , it identifies the appropriate physical quantities that are to count as probabilities instead .",
    "there remains one other obvious fact without which one might well think no account of chance can so much as get off the ground : chance outcomes are typically _ mutually exclusive _ or _",
    "incompatible _  in which case only _",
    "one _ outcome obtains ( which one happens by chance ) .",
    "that is ( where i explicitly add the qualification ` observable ' , as we are concerned with how chances can be measured ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * presupposition * : of two incompatible , observable , chance events , only _",
    "one _ event happens _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    how can the presupposition be explained in eqm ? in comparison with (",
    "a)-(e ) it seems to have the least to do with chance  the word ` chance ' could be deleted from it entirely  but we surely do talk about chance in this way .",
    "it is presupposed by any application of the concept of chance that ( at least sometimes ) chances apply to incompatible outcomes .",
    "the concept of incompatibility enters at the the very beginning of any mathematical definition of a probability measure on a space of events ( events are represented by sets , and inherit from set theory the structure of a boolean algebra ) . and",
    "yet it seems to be violated straightforwardly in eqm , as everett s crazy idea was that in a quantum measurement _ all _ outcomes happen .",
    "if that was all there was to it it would be hard to understand why eqm was ever taken seriously by anyone .",
    "the answer is that the presupposition has two different readings , the one a physical or metaphysical claim  about what chances fundamentally are  and the other a claim about what is observable ( by any observer ) , the phenomenology of chance .    on the first reading ,",
    "the presupposition _ is _ straightforwardly denied ; it is denied if the word ` chance ' is deleted too .",
    "but we already knew this : this is simply a conflict between a many - worlds and a one - world theory .",
    "likewise for the presupposition as a metaphysical claim :  we already knew eqm challenges a number of a priori claims .",
    "it is only as an epistemological claim  as to the _ observed _ phenomenology  that the presupposition had better still make sense .",
    "but so it does : eqm explains it very simply .",
    "no two incompatible chance outcomes can happen _ in the same branch_. and since the apparatus , and the observer , and the entire observable universe , are branch - relative  they are ` in - branch ' structures  no observer can ever witness incompatible outcomes simultaneously . and",
    ", ultimately , the von neumann model of measurement . see also gell - mann and hartle [ 1990 ] and saunders [ 1994 ] . ) ] in this second sense , then , the presupposition is rather elegantly dealt with in eqm  ` elegantly ' , because it follows directly from its account of what a chance set - up is , and from what chance is ( one should _ not _ delete the word ` chance ' ! ) .",
    "the other everyday ( ` no - go ' ) facts about probabilities follow , not from branching alone , but from the unitarity of the equations of motion . because i do not think this claim is particularly controversial i will simply illustrate it with a proof of ( a ) , for relative probabilities ( meaning a quantity that concerns the relationships between chancy outcomes).consider then a microscopic system in the state @xmath2for simplicity , model the measurement process as a 1-step history , using the schrdinger picture , with initial state @xmath3 is the state of the rest of the universe .",
    "let the configuration describing ( among other things ) the apparatus registering ( a function of ) the amplitude @xmath4 at time @xmath5 be @xmath6 .",
    "let the projection onto this configuration be @xmath7 and let the associated heisenberg - picture projection be @xmath8(see appendix 1 for how quantum histories are defined as time - ordered products of such projectors . )",
    "the no - go fact we need to establish is that there is no unitary dynamics @xmath9 @xmath10 by means of which :    @xmath11    for variable @xmath12 if there were it would also follow that for @xmath13:@xmath14but the inner product of the lhs of the two initial states can be as close to one as desired , whilst that of the vectors on the rhs must be zero , as @xmath6 and @xmath15 must differ macroscopically for sufficiently large @xmath16 , a contradiction .",
    "thus not even relative probabilities can be measured deterministically .",
    "( the argument for absolute probabilities is even simpler , and depends only on the linearity of the schrdinger equation . )",
    "now for ( e ) , how ( relative ) chances can be measured according to eqm , with high chance .",
    "take a number @xmath17 of subsystems , each ( to a good approximation ) in state @xmath18 , and arrange the linear dynamics so that@xmath19i.e .",
    "the von neumann model of measurement , where @xmath20 is a configuration in which the apparatus reads ` spin up ' and @xmath21 ` spin down ' . applied to an initial state of the form @xmath22 , it yields the superposition @xmath23 in which the first vector has norm @xmath24 and the second has norm @xmath25 that is , the amplitudes @xmath4 , @xmath26 of components in a microscopic superposition have been promoted to macroscopic _ branch _ amplitudes .",
    "consider now repeated measurements of @xmath17 microscopic systems all in the same state @xmath27 , whether sequentially repeated in time , or measured all at once .",
    "the latter is the simplest to model , assuming the @xmath17 apparatuses are non - interacting : the result at time @xmath5 will be a superposition of vectors at @xmath5 of the form @xmath28where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is either + 1 or -1 .",
    "those with the same relative frequencies @xmath31 will all have the same norm , i.e.:@xmath32the unitary evolution to time @xmath5 is : @xmath33 .\\]]the right - most summation , for fixed @xmath34 , is over all @xmath35 distinct @xmath36 s , all with the same norm eq.(2 ) . since @xmath37 @xmath38 for @xmath39 ,",
    "the squared norm of the rhs of eq.(3 ) is",
    "@xmath40    where @xmath41 is:@xmath42for @xmath17 large , this function is strongly peaked about @xmath43 the sum of norms of vectors with the ` right ' relative frequency is much larger than the sum of norms of vectors with the ` wrong ' relative frequency . in this sense measured relative frequencies close to @xmath44",
    "are found on relatively high amplitude branches .",
    "it was rather crucial to this argument that we consider only relative frequency  we do nt care about precisely which particles were recorded as ` spin - up ' and ` spin - down ' ( or which of our @xmath45apparatuses recorded which result ) .",
    "that is , our measurement protocol requires that the measurements be treated as ` exchangeable ' , in de finetti s sense ( greaves and myrvold [ 2010 pp.277 - 80 ] ) .",
    "this is an axiom of de finetti s approach , whereas in eqm it is explained",
    ".    might some other method be found by which functions of amplitudes may be measured , flouting ( a)-(d ) ?",
    "perhaps ; ) , although see the criticism of uffink [ 2000 ] ) ; or ` weak measurements ' ( aharonov et al [ 1988 ] ) . ]",
    "but that is unlikely to make for objection if , like eqm , it is based on the unitary formalism of quantum mechanics . if based on a rival theory , which is empirically successful , that will anyway spell the end of quantum mechanics ( and with it eqm ) .",
    "now suppose , fancifully if you will , that we are entitled to identify chances with functions of branch amplitudes .",
    "then in summary we have just shown : chances will generally be associated with incompatible observable outcomes , only one of which can happen at each time ; they may not be measured in a way that is not itself chancy , and single - case chance can not be measured at all .",
    "they can only be measured by running a chance ( branching ) process repeatedly , or by a single trial involving a large number of similarly prepared systems , and listing the relative frequencies ( taking care to neglect the order of outcomes , or which system had which outcome ) .",
    "the measurement will be veridical , however , only with high chance , given the number of systems involved is sufficiently large .",
    "none of these facts can be explained by any conventional physical theory of probability ( rather , they are presupposed ) .",
    "we can not , however , identify chance set - ups with branch set - ups , and chances with functions of amplitudes , failing an account of ( iii ) , the link with uncertainty . in the absence of this , to arrive , by the deutsch - wallace representation theorem , at an agent s credence function ( in conformity with the born rule ) , raises a puzzle on its own . for what",
    "does a rational agent believe to some degree when she uses that credence function ? given the theorem , certainly we can explain credence by reference to behaviour ; but in this case , better , perhaps , to simply explain it away .",
    "a rational agent must order her priorities somehow , whether or not there is anything of which she is uncertain ; but it is hard to see how is it possible to have degrees of belief different from one and zero if you know everything there is to know .",
    "the functionalists response is to more or less recapitulate the representation theorem : credences derive their meaning from their function in rational action , in determining expected utilities , and hence agents preferences .",
    "they will also note that meaning is determined by use  that if anything has been agreed by philosophers of language in recent decades it is :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ words have no function save as they play a role in sentences : their semantic features are abstracted from the semantic features of sentences , just as the semantic features of sentences are abstracted from their part in helping people achieve goals or realize intentions .",
    "( davidson [ 2001 , p. 220 ] ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    so there is every reason to talk of expected utilities and credences . by the same broadly functionalist philosophy , if these credences play the same role that credences about chance events play , they _ are _ credences about chance events .",
    "talk of uncertainty and unpredictability then falls into place along with the rest of our ordinary use of words .",
    "i think this argument is essentially correct , but it leaves unanswered  brief explanations please ! ",
    "just _ how _ talk of uncertainty is to fall into place , and just _ what _ to say in answer to the question of what these degrees of belief are about .    first a warm - up . in the previous section",
    "i argued that functions of branch amplitudes are measured  they are manifested in - branch  in just the way that chances are measured .",
    "a part of that argument was that the presupposition about incompatible outcomes follows ( rather straightforwardly ) from eqm : on each trial , since macroscopically distinct , only one outcome can be obtained in each branch .",
    "so from the point of view of accumulating information that can actually be used  ` in - branch ' information  events are registered sequentially , just as they are in a non - branching theory .",
    "this was what everett [ 1957 ] took pains to show .",
    "but is nt sequential increase in information increase in knowledge ? so is nt there something that is being learned in each branch ?    consider a concrete example .",
    "alice , we suppose , is about to perform a stern - gerlach experiment .",
    "she understands the structure of the apparatus and the state preparation device , and she is convinced eqm  is true . in what sense",
    "does she learn , post - branching , something new ?",
    "the answer is that _ each _ alice _ _ , _ _ post - branching _ _ , _ _ learns something new ( or is in a position to learn something new )  each will say something ( namely , ` i see the outcome is spin - up ( respectively , spin - down ) , and not spin - down ( respectively , spin - up ) ' ) that alice prior to branching can not say .",
    "it is true that alice , prior to branching knows _ _  that _ _",
    "this is what each successor will say  but still she herself can not speak in this way .    to make this vivid , imagine that each of her successors simply _ closes her eyes _",
    ", when the result is obtained ; in that state , each is genuinely ignorant of the result ( so - called ` vaidman ignorance ' ; vaidman [ 1998 ] ) .",
    "this has usually been considered ( by vaidman himself ) as ignorance that alice , prior to branching , does not have , but it can be turned around the other way : each alice , closing her eyes , perpetuates a state of ignorance that she already had .    the implication of this line of thought , although she develops it in a rather different way .",
    "] is that appearances notwithstanding , prior to branching alice does _ not _ know everything there is to know .",
    "what is it she does not know ?",
    "i say ` appearances notwithstanding ' , for of course in one sense ( we may suppose ) alice does know everything there is to know ;  she knows ( we might as well assume ) the entire corpus of impersonal , scientific knowledge .",
    "but what that does not tell her is _ just which person she is _  or _ where she is located _",
    " in the wave - function of the universe .",
    "the point is a familiar one to philosophers .",
    "one can know that there are such - and - such people , but not which one of them is me . or that such - and - such events occur at various places , but not which of those places is here ; or times , but not which of those times is now .",
    "such knowledge that is omitted is sometimes called ` indexical ' knowledge , by philosophers , also ` knowledge de se ' , and ` self - locating knowledge ' ( we shall use the latter ) . but why should knowledge like this be lacking?vaidman has alice hide her eyes .",
    "another example , due to j. r. perry , likewise suggests some kind of impairment is needed .",
    "perry asks us to consider an amnesiac who has lost his way in the library at stanford .",
    "he does not know who he is ; he does not know where he is  not even were he to read every book in the library , not even if he were to read his own _ biography _ , would he be any the wiser .",
    "but alice is not so impaired .",
    "she does not hide her eyes , and no more is she an amnesiac .",
    "she sees where she is in the wave - function of the universe and self - locates accordingly  and differently  from where her successors locate themselves , for , obviously , she is at a different place from them .",
    "she is not ignorant of anything her successors know ; she simply reports different self - locating facts from them .",
    "and so she would , _ but only given certain assumptions as to what , exactly , she is  of how she is represented in the physics_. for example , if she at @xmath46 is represented by the configuration @xmath47 , or by the heisenberg - picture vector @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the universal state , with her successors at @xmath50 similarly represented by configurations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , or vectors @xmath53 , the result surely follows . but this treats her as strictly a momentary thing , independent of the history in which she is located .",
    "there is an alternative : if she at @xmath46 is represented instead by an entire history @xmath54 , indexed by @xmath46 , then of course , at @xmath46 , she does not know which history or branch vector is hers , and quite the opposite result follows .    which of the two is correct ?  but questions like these ( or rather their classical counterparts ) are well known in metaphysics ( and specifically personal identity ) .",
    "most philosophers are agreed they can not be settled on the basis of the physics alone . here",
    "then is a metaphysics friendly to the everett interpretation : let persons be spacetime worldtubes from cradle to grave ( in the jargon , ` maximal continuants ' ) . if alice is a person ( of course she is ) then we must say , even prior to branching at @xmath46 , that there are _ many _",
    "alice s present , atom - for - atom duplicates up to @xmath55 , each behaving in exactly the same way and saying just the same words .",
    "if that is the right metaphysical picture for eqm , then alice _ should _ be uncertain after all   _ each _ alice should be uncertain  for each as of @xmath46 does not ( and as a matter of principle , can not ) know which of these branching persons is she .",
    "that , i take it , establishes that the question of whether or not there is uncertainty in the everett interpretation can be settled either way , depending on a metaphysics of personal identity .",
    "but rather than invoke a metaphysical assumption , we can make do with a different kind of claim  a proposal , not about the ultimate natures of persons , but about the reference of the word ` person ' in eqm terms .",
    "the proposal is that talk of persons ( and things ) be relativized as to branch : , [ 2006 ] and in more detail in saunders and wallace [ 2008a ] , on which the argument that follows is based . ]    s1 : :    by a person or ` thing ' is meant a branch - part or ordered pair    @xmath56,@xmath57 , where    @xmath58    here ` @xmath59 ' means the sequence of configurations @xmath60 is obtained by a coarse - graining of @xmath61 , which we suppose is temporally and spatially much more finely grained .",
    "likewise ` a person at time @xmath46 ' is represented by an ordered triple @xmath62 ( if a person is an entire history ) , where @xmath63 , or by an ordered pair @xmath64,@xmath57 ( if a person is a stage ) .",
    "more is needed for tensed sentences ( involving ` was ' , ` is ' , ` will be ' etc . ) , but for this , and on the question of how s1 can be justified , see section 4 .    for now note @xmath65 s virtues .",
    "first , it is clearly permissible ; it makes use of nothing but the available mathematics of eqm in terms of branch vectors latexmath:[$%    @xmath61 , @xmath54 etc .",
    ", as ordered pairs @xmath67 @xmath68 . ] .",
    "true , this requires the consistent histories formalism , in which branch vectors are heisenberg - picture vectors ( so that a branch vector @xmath69 describes the entire history @xmath61 , not any particular instant of it ) .",
    "the perspective is atemporal . but",
    "branching itself is a process defined by the dynamics over time : the idea of a decoherence basis , defined at an instant of time independent of what comes before and what comes after , is a fiction .",
    "second , using @xmath65 , not only is alice entitled  bound  to be unsure of the outcome of the experiment , but she has a genuine gain in knowledge when it is learned .",
    "for after branching , using s1 , on observing the outcome , each alice self - locates better than she did before  knows more than she did before  and so has learned something that , prior to branching , she could not have known .",
    "vaidman s ignorance is ignorance each alice already had .",
    "likewise , there can be no algorithm , whose input is data about a branch up to one time , and whose output uniquely specifies that branch at a later time ; for the same algorithm must operate in every other branch which is exactly the same up to that time but which differs thereafter . branching events are algorithmically uncertain too  they are _",
    "indeterministic_.    third , @xmath65 is neutral on some ( but not all ) metaphysical questions about personal identity",

    "the bottom line : under @xmath65 , prior to branching , uncertainty is assured : alice does nt know if she will see spin - down or spin - up , as she does nt know which branch she is in . unless some hidden contradiction is involved",
    ", @xmath65 is the right rule for making sense of quantum mechanics in realist terms .    *",
    "conclusion . *",
    "branching , the development of superpositions of the universal state with respect to the decoherence basis , plays all the chance roles ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) : it produces the same phenomenology as chance , the squared norms of branch amplitudes are of practical relevance to decision theory in the way that chances normally are , and using si , branching involves uncertainty , just as chances do . in eqm ,",
    "branching and squared norms of branch amplitudes are demonstrably functionally equivalent to chance , in these three central respects ; therefore they _ are _ chance processes , and chances _ are _ these physical magnitudes .",
    "there are alternatives to the rule @xmath65 , however . invoking it seems to compromise a chief selling point of the everett interpretation , which is that many worlds follows from the unitary dynamics , with no added principles or special assumptions .",
    "that is what puts the everett interpretation  in a class of its own when it comes to the quantum realism problem : there are plenty of avenues for obtaining ( at least non - relativistic ) one - world theories if we are prepared to violate this precept .    on the other hand @xmath65 is on the face of it _ just _ a semantic rule ",
    "it is _ merely _ a linguistic matter .",
    "the referents of terms are constrained by their contexts of use , granted ; but over and above those constraints , not even in the god s eye view is their meaning determined .",
    "it is up to us to say what , precisely , among the structures in the universal state , our words really mean . and",
    "if that is all there is to uncertainty , nothing much should hang on the matter either way .",
    "the challenge remains : to justify the probability interpretation of eqm on the grounds of ( i ) and ( ii ) alone .",
    "i think there is something right about this argument . whether or not there is genuine uncertainty in the everett interpretation appears rather less substantive than might have been thought .",
    "but in that case , let satisfaction of the chance roles ( i ) and ( ii ) be enough to count for branching to count as chance ; our conclusion stands .",
    "but on three counts this would be too quick .",
    "the first is that for many , @xmath65 _ really is _ a metaphysical claim , for all my talk of semantics  and that there _ is _ a substantive question of whether it is true .",
    "certainly there are alternative metaphysical claims that could be made that cause problems to @xmath65 .",
    "i shall have something to say about this sort of argument , but not much : for i do not believe there are metaphysical truths of this sort , independent of ordinary language and natural science . or let me put the point more constructively : metaphysics should primarily be answerable to language and to science ; it should be ` naturalized ' ( saunders [ 1997 ] , ladyman and ross [ 2007 ] ) . if this is right @xmath65 may still be a metaphysical claim , a claim of substance , but in the naturalized sense .",
    "the second count is that we should take rather more seriously the task of accounting for language use , for that too is emergent structure , a part of the physical world to be studied as such by scientific means . as with any form of functional reduction",
    ", we know what we are looking for in advance : the problem is to identify the right sort of structure at the more fundamental physical level to account for phenomena that we are already familiar with at the less .",
    "devising semantic rules , whose truth conditions are fixed by reference to the underlying theory , is only a variation on the same procedure ",
    "it is reductionism as it is appropriate to linguistics .",
    "it is no different in kind from fixing on certain variables , for example hydrodynamical variables , in decoherence theory , to derive quasiclassicality .",
    "sure , there remain the _ wrong _ variables , ones that give no hint of classicality ; and wrong semantic rules too , which are inadequate to explaining our linguistic behaviour  and which give no hint of uncertainty . they should be eschewed .",
    "this argument is a variant of wallace s [ 2005 ] , which puts the matter in terms of ` the principle of charity ' .",
    "this principle says that the most important criterion of ` good ' translation , in the radical case , where no prior standard of translation has been established , is that it maximizes truth .",
    "working out what to say about branching , if eqm is true , is like radical translation  of how to translate into our own tongue the expressions of some alien language on the basis of observable linguistic behaviour alone .",
    "if eqm is true , it has always been true , and we have always used words like ` uncertainty ' and ` chance ' in the context of branching so  like it or not !  that is what those words have always been about .",
    "whatever we might say about novel scenarios like teleportation machines or brain transplants ( the ways in which philosophers have tended to imagine persons being divided ) our use of words in ordinary contexts is not in doubt .",
    "the referents of ordinary words and truth conditions of everyday sentences ( as specified in a physical theory ) may wait to be correctly identified , but the criteria for ` correctness ' is decided , not by metaphysics , but by their adequacy , as follows from the theory , to make sense of what we ordinarily say .    greaves herself accepts this argument ( greaves [ 2007 p.124 ] ) , but not all everettians do , and surely not all skeptics of eqm  do . but this dispute is independent of eqm per se .",
    "it should be settled if possible by some other example of the general method  say , in the arena of a semantics for temporal affairs , involving tense and becoming , in classical spacetime theories ( as argued by saunders [ 1996 ] , wallace [ 2005 ] ) , or in the arena of a semantics for agency , moral responsibility , and free - will , in deterministic theories",
    ".    the third count on which the case for uncertainty can be too quickly deflated is a strengthened version of the first .",
    "i have already hinted at it :  maybe @xmath65 _ does _ harbour some hidden contradiction , or some failure of integrity more broadly construed .",
    "the semantics should not _ misrepresent _ our situation , were eqm true .",
    "this , it seems to me , is the only serious concern , and the only one i shall consider in the rest of this chapter .",
    "but it needs explaining .",
    "the very worry seems strange .",
    "how can a sentence misrepresent a theory , if it is true by that very theory ?",
    "some more detail on the semantics will be helpful for some alternatives .",
    "the rules that follow are illustrative . ] .",
    "let @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is much later than any time we are interested in , and @xmath73 is much earlier .",
    "call branches like this",
    "_ maximal_. by ` world ' i mean maximal branches , represented by maximal branch vectors .",
    "let @xmath74 be true of some branches , false of others . then",
    "since , by @xmath65 , speakers and things are parts of branches , so are utterances :      now for tensed statements .",
    "let @xmath76 , @xmath77 be _ the future of _ @xmath61 _ at _ @xmath5 ; let @xmath78 , @xmath79 be the _ past of _ @xmath61 _ at _ @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath74 be true at some times , false at others ( it is an ` occasion sentence ' , in quinean terms ) .",
    "the rule for future physical contingencies is :        s4 : :    an utterance of ` @xmath74 might happen ' in branch    @xmath69 at @xmath5 is true if and only    if for some branch @xmath80    @xmath74 is true in the future of    @xmath81 at @xmath5 , where the past of    @xmath82 and @xmath61 at @xmath5 is    the same .",
    "but the latter will obviously need to be restricted to branches vectors @xmath83 whose norm , conditional on @xmath84 , is non - negligible ( or else it will turn out that pretty well anything might happen ) . and similarly for counterfactuals .",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 , fairly obviously , satisfy the principle of charity .",
    "@xmath87 promises to , at least if ` might happen ' is taken to mean ` might happen by chance '  that is , in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics . apart from this proviso , it fits well enough with standard ideas in modal metaphysics .",
    "one has only to replace ` branch latexmath:[$%      now notice that the ` sameness of the past ' relation is neutral on the question of whether , in the past , ( maximal ) branches ( or rather spatiotemporal parts of such branches )  are _ numerically _ the same , or only _ qualitatively _ the same .",
    "they are neutral on the question of whether ( to use a technical term in philosophy ) they ` overlap ' or merely ` diverge ' . but this difference is crucial , say metaphysicians .",
    "rules like @xmath89 have been offered by philosophers ( almost always ) as a semantics for the latter sort , for ` diverging ' worlds , not for the former  or , as philosophers also call overlapping worlds , ` branching ' worlds .    which is it , in eqm ?",
    "this question is in danger of being settled on the basis of an accident of terminology .",
    "let us agree that ` branching ' means the development of superpositions with respect to the decoherence basis .",
    "for the sense intended by philosophers  where there are numerical identities among spatiotemporal parts  we will speak of ` overlap ' .",
    "mundane examples of overlap are everywhere .",
    "thus roads overlap if they share the same stretch of asphalt ; houses and roofs , cars and steering wheels , hands and fingers , all overlap .",
    "overlapping , like everettian branching , supposedly has a formal definition too , but not in terms of hilbert space structure .",
    "rather , it is defined in terms of ` mereology ' , the general theory of parts and wholes .",
    "( i shall come back to this shortly . )    as for ` divergence ' , its definition is more equivocal .",
    "it is sometimes used to mean that there exist no physical relations between worlds , contrary to the situation for worlds in eqm , where i erroneously said that ` fatalism ' ( a near - neighbour to the position i am currently defending ) involved the replacement of the superposition of histories ( the universal state ) by an incoherent mixture of histories , and must thus be rejected . ] , but we shall take it as simply the opposite of overlap : ` diverging ' means ` non - overlapping ' .",
    "now to the point :  if worlds overlap in eqm then ( definitionally ) there are genuine transworld identities .",
    "the very same thing exists in different worlds .",
    "in particular , since branching is massive in eqm , if worlds overlap then the very same person is part of vast numbers of worlds , differing , perhaps , only in respects remote in space and time  differing , maybe , only after centuries .",
    "all this is contrary to @xmath65 . in that case",
    "any uncertainty to be had can have nothing to do with a metaphysics of personal identity .",
    "but is there any uncertainty to be had ?",
    "the worry is not that overlapping worlds are unintelligible or inconsistent ; it is that they make nonsense of ordinary beliefs .",

    "we should discount two considerations .",
    "first , the coincidence in the terminology ` branching ' ( because as introduced by everett , it referred to the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics , not to the philosophers criterion of overlap ) .",
    "second , the fact that worlds in eqm do not diverge in the sense of being physically disconnected ( they are not physically disconnected , because they superpose , but the issue is whether or not they overlap ) .",
    "their remains another consideration , however .",
    "there is a clear parallel with simultaneous rather than temporal overlap . for ( ignoring entanglement )",
    "let the schrdinger - picture state of a composite system of observer and environment at time @xmath5 be @xmath90where @xmath91is the state of the observer , and @xmath92 is the state of the environment , a superposition of macroscopically distinct states @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "perhaps the latter only differ with respect to macroscopic objects at enormously large spacelike distances  say , a radioactive decay that triggers a macroscopically significant event on a planetary system in the far side of andromeda .",
    "in such a case , it is not at all obvious that the observer should be uncertain as to which branch , @xmath95 or @xmath96 , she belongs .",
    "her relative state in everett s sense is the superposition @xmath97 ; in this there is no hint of uncertainty .",
    "true enough , but for the mathematical identity:@xmath98we can read the relativization the other way : of the observer @xmath99 relative to the environment @xmath100 with amplitude @xmath101 , and of another observer @xmath91 relative to the environment @xmath102 they are not even qualitatively the same .",
    "pursuit of the question of quantum non - locality leads on to relativity , where it connects with ordinary beliefs about probability in much the same way that the relativity of simultaneity connects with ordinary beliefs about tense ( saunders [ 1995 , 1996 ] ) . here",
    "we shall stick to probability as it applies to events related by unambiguously timelike relations , as it figures in our practical lives .",

    "the relationship between schrdinger picture states at time @xmath109 resulting from the history @xmath110 is , up to normalization : @xmath111that is , the schrdinger picture state at time @xmath5 is ( the forward evolution to @xmath5 ) of a superposition of heisenberg - picture states @xmath112 @xmath113 , all with the same sequence of configurations @xmath105 up to time @xmath114 let ` worlds ' , as before , be represented by maximal branch vectors @xmath69 .",
    "do worlds overlap or diverge ?                here is the point made graphically .",
    "fig 1a depicts the orbit of a schrdinger picture wave - function that develops into a superposition of components @xmath0 , @xmath74 and @xmath115 , with squared norms as indicated ; this explains how branches came by their name .",
    "but the branches themselves can be depicted in two ways , by either fig 1b or fig 1c . in fig 1c",
    "it seems that branches do not overlap , whereas in fig 1b it seems that they do .",
    "which of them is correct ?",
    "evidently the difference concerns only their amplitudes ; of the two , fig 1c is the obvious representation for heisenberg picture vectors , which each have a unique amplitude .",
    "fig 1b depicts rather graphs of schrdinger picture states subject to state collapse , without renormalizing . which of them is the ` correct ' picture ?",
    "but once stated in this way , the suspicion is that whether worlds in eqm diverge or overlap is _ underdetermined _ by the mathematics .",
    "one can use either picture ; they are better or worse adapted to different purposes .    if so , it is pretty clear which is the right one for making sense of uncertainty .",
    "but of course fig 1c is only a visual aid : can we be sure that the heisenberg - picture branch vectors do not overlap ? this , perhaps , is a _ technical _ philosophical question , to be settled by a theory of parts and wholes for vectors  by a vector mereology .",
    "alas , there is no such theory , or none on which there is any agreement .",
    "mereology , if it is close to any branch of mathematics , is close to set theory ( lewis [ 1991 ) ] , but even there its links are controversial .",
    "we are going to have to make this up as we go along . and it is a good question , at this point , as to where the burden of proof really lies .",
    "mereology has paid little or no dividends in pure mathematics , let alone in physics .",
    "it is at bottom an a priori metaphysical theory .",
    "a very good desideratum on any reasonable metaphysics is that it makes sense of our best physical theory , rather than nonsense .",
    "metaphysicians can , however , reasonably insist on an existence proof  a demonstration that at least one vector space mereology can be defined in terms of which maximal branches in eqm do not overlap .",
    "here is a simple construction that depends essentially on the branching structure of a consistent history space .",
    "let maximal branch vectors @xmath69 be defined as before .",
    "any non - maximal branch vector @xmath116 can then be written ( appendix 1 ) : @xmath117 by the consistency condition , @xmath118 for @xmath119 ; therefore for any two branch vectors @xmath120 there exists a unique branch vector @xmath121 and orthogonal branch vectors @xmath122 such that @xmath123namely the vector:@xmath124our candidate mereology is then :  a branch vector @xmath125 is part of @xmath126 ( denote @xmath127 ) if and only if either ( a ) @xmath128 or ( b ) there exists a non - zero branch vector @xmath129 such that @xmath130 , @xmath131 @xmath132    standard axioms of mereology are listed in appendix 2 ; it is easy to check that they are satisfied by the parthood relation just defined . from the overlap relation derived from @xmath133 , we see that orthogonal vectors do not overlap .",
    "it follows that every branch vector is part of the universal state @xmath134 , as seems appropriate , but that orthogonal branch vectors have no parts in common .",
    "since , by consistency , branching always produces orthogonal branch vectors , the branch vector representing alice seeing spin down has no part in common with that representing alice seeing spin up . on this",
    "basis branches of this kind diverge , in the philosophical sense , as do maximal branches .",
    "but in what sense , it might be asked , is _",
    "alice _ represented as a part of a maximal branch vector @xmath69? for the latter ( on our candidate mereology ) has no vectors as proper parts .",
    "the answer is that alice is represented not by a vector at all , but by a sub - sequence @xmath54 of configurations of @xmath135 ( see again @xmath65 , and our use of ordered pairs @xmath136  given which , questions about alice and the part - whole relation in alice s world are treated quasiclassically .",
    "it can hardly be objected that there must exist a uniform theory of mereology that applies across the board to emergent ontology . far from it : that is a piece of metaphysics that has had little or no success in the special sciences .",
    "we concede only that one might be constructible in each domain .    with",
    "that it should be clear that our vector mereology on its own does not settle the question of uncertainty .",
    "alice s successors downstream of branching diverge from each other , but they may still overlap with alice prior to branching , even given our vector mereology .",
    "a branch can be coarse - grained from the time @xmath5 of branching in such a way that it is degenerate with respect to alice seeing spin - up and alice seeing spin - down .",
    "thus a branch vector that represents only alice s past @xmath105 at @xmath137 ( of the form @xmath138 @xmath139 , the heisenberg - picture analogue of eq.(5 ) ) represents alice as containing all her possible future selves , that is , as overlapping completely , according to our mereology , with all her possible future selves , even if they do not overlap with each other .    and there , in a nutshell , is the contrary view :  by all means take the parthood relation as specified , but let ` alice ' be indexed to time , and be represented by a schrdinger picture vector accordingly ( as given by eq.(5 ) ) , or by the heisenberg - picture branch vector @xmath140 , rather than by relativization to a maximal branch .",
    "alice in this sense overlaps with all of her successors , and the grounds for self - locating uncertainty evaporate .",
    "we always knew we had this option , however .",
    "this is to reject @xmath65 not on the grounds that worlds in eqm really overlap ( on our proposed mereology they do not ) , but because _ superpositions of worlds _ overlap , and because ( so goes the objection ) persons and things _ should _ be represented by superpositions of worlds , superpositions of vectors .    but why should they ?",
    "we can do the same in the case of diverging worlds of the sort usually considered by metaphysicians ( having nothing to do with quantum mechanics ) , or as they arise in cosmic inflation ( see e.g. tegmark [ 2010 ] . in either case",
    "it is uncontroversial that worlds do not overlap , but still , _ sets _ of worlds do .",
    "let a person or a thing up to time @xmath5 be a _ set _ of worlds , namely of those that contain that person or thing or one qualitatively identical up to time @xmath5 ( which could be far in the future ) : then there is no uncertainty of where a person or thing is located among worlds that diverge after that time , either . but metaphysicians are unlikely to take this proposal very seriously , not least because it makes nonsense of much of what we say .",
    "nor should we in the analogous case in eqm .. he also offers arguments why , even if there is no _ self - locating _",
    "uncertainty prior to branching in eqm , uncertainty can nevertheless be grounded on post - branching ( vaidman ) uncertainty ( tappenden [ 2011b ] ) .",
    "see also his criticisms of saunders and wallace [ 2008a , b ] in tappenden [ 2008 ] ) . ]",
    "to conclude : there is no good reason to think eqm is really a theory of overlapping worlds .",
    "if questions of overlap of branches are to be settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics , in terms of vector space structure , then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which worlds that differ in some feature , since orthogonal , are non - overlapping .",
    "the semantics s1-s4 does _ not _ misrepresent the underlying mathematical structure of the theory ; in terms of this mereology , it correctly describes worlds as non - overlapping .",
    "but it does follow that the word ` branching ' is something of a misnomer , in the context of eqm , in the philosophers sense of the word .",
    "but then the word ` diverging ' is also infelicitous . `",
