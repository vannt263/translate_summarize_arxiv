    "the classification of the universality classes of nonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states is still an open problem of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion ( rd ) models exhibiting phase transitions to absorbing states bear with a particular interest since many other types of systems like surface growth , spin systems or stochastic cellular automata can be mapped on them . unfortunately there hasnt been experimental verification of such classes except the coagulating random walk : @xmath0 ( crw ) in one dimension @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the most well known , robust directed percolation ( dp ) class @xcite is sensitive to disorder @xcite , which occurs in real systems naturally .",
    "it would be very important to find some other nonequilibrium class , which proves to be less sensitive to disorder , hence would provide a candidate for experimental verification .",
    "the study of disordered systems is a hot topic of current research of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "a principal condition for the relevancy of disorder is the harris criterion @xcite set up for equilibrium systems and has been found to be valid in some nonequilibrium models .",
    "according to this criterion the pure critical point is stable against disorder if the spatial correlation length critical exponent @xmath1 fulfills the inequality @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spatial dimensionality .",
    "however an exception is reported very recently @xcite for dp with temporal disorder .",
    "note that for crw ( which is exhibits the same scaling behavior as the @xmath4 annihilating random walk ( arw ) in 1d ) this criterion predicts relevant spatial disorder , ( @xmath5 ) still experiment @xcite did not report measurable effect of randomness unless very strong disorder fractures the medium .",
    "besides the robust dp an other well known universality class is the so called `` parity conserving '' ( pc ) class of 1d nonequilibrium transitions .",
    "this was discovered in a one - dimensional stochastic cellular automata ( ca ) exhibiting @xmath6 symmetric absorbing states and domain walls following even offspringed branching and annihilating random walk : @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( barw2 ) @xcite .",
    "later it was observed by numerical studies of other models @xcite and field theoretical studies @xcite confirmed the existence of a corresponding fixed point distinct from that of dp . for a review see @xcite .",
    "this class is also called as directed ising , dp2 or generalized voter model class .",
    "according to the harris criterion disorder should be relevant for the critical behavior of this class ( @xmath9@xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to this a recent renormalization group ( rg ) study @xcite did not find a strong disorder fixed point like in case of dp .",
    "the question naturally arises if barw2 is really insensitive to disorder or the rg method @xcite is not applicable for this case .",
    "the principal aim of the present study is to answer this question .",
    "additionally in the absorbing phase of the barw2 model the arw dynamics dominates , which has also been addressed in the studies @xcite .",
    "the renormalization study of arw with spatial randomness in the reaction rates found marginal perturbations to the fixed point of the pure system @xcite . on the other hand an exact study of the infinite reaction rate arw with space - dependent hopping rates found non - universal power - law decay of the density of a - s below a critical temperature @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite the strong disorder is defined in such a way that it can not completely block reactions or diffusion of the reactants .",
    "therefore the so called infinitely strong fixed point of @xcite does not correspond to the blocking case .",
    "such blocking or complete dilution was studied in a 1d toy model of random quantum ferromagnetic ising model @xcite where continuously variable power laws were found at the phase transition point .",
    "the effect of disconnected domains in the reactions of crw and arw has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "this study reported stretched exponential decay in case of exponential domain size distributions and continuously changing density decay for blocks distributed in a power - law manner . in the 1d model",
    "we investigate such complete blocking may also occur , hence we investigate this topological effect .",
    "to study pc class transitions with disorder we have chosen a very simple stochastic cellular automaton ( sca ) the nekimca introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that the dual variables of spins ( @xmath10 ) the kinks ( @xmath11 ) exhibit barw2 dynamics via the synchronous spin - flip dynamics . in this sca parity conserving kink branching is also generated due to the synchronous spin update of neighboring sites without introducing an explicit spin - exchange reaction as in case of the nekim model @xcite .",
    "the reactions are like the followings :    * random walk : @xmath12 * annihilation : @xmath13 * branching : @xmath14    in the nekimca there are two independent parameters parametrized as @xmath15    in the computer the state of a single spin is represented by a 1 or 0 of a 32 or 64 bit word @xmath16 ( depending on the cpu type ) . hence",
    "32 or 64 ca samples ( exhibiting different random initial conditions but the same quenched noise ) updated at once .    the following bit - parallel algorithm was used for the update of states @xmath16 at site @xmath17 . a random number @xmath18 is selected with uniform distribution .",
    "if @xmath19 a spin - flip , corresponding to random walk of the dual variable @xmath20 \\land s(j)\\ ] ] is written to all bits of @xmath21 . following this another uniformly distributed random number @xmath22",
    "is chosen and if @xmath23 a spin - flip , corresponding to annihilation of the dual variables @xmath24 \\ \\ & \\ [ s(j+1 ) \\land \\",
    "s(j ) ]   ) \\ \\land s(j)\\ ] ] is performed . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the quenched random noise variable with uniform distribution @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the logical xor and and of computer words .",
    "note that for strong disorder @xmath29 or @xmath30 may be less than @xmath31 at a site meaning a blockade for that reaction .",
    "a single monte carlo step ( mcs ) consists of updating all @xmath32 sites with periodic boundary conditions and writing back @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( throughout the paper the time is measured by mcs ) .",
    "the simulations were carried out on @xmath35 sized systems . with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the initial states were randomly half filled lattices , and the density of kinks is followed up to @xmath36 mcs .",
    "we started the exploration of the @xmath37 phase diagram by determining the phase transition of the impurity free ( @xmath38 ) case with @xmath39 .",
    "this was located at @xmath40 as a power - law decay of the kink density @xmath41 with exponent @xmath42 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the pc class value @xcite .",
    "next we introduced the quenched disorder and determined @xmath43 for different @xmath44 values .",
    "table [ pct ] and fig.[deltac ] show the results .",
    ".numerical results for the disordered pc class transition line .",
    "[ pct ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spreading exponent @xmath45 changes similarly along the freezing transition line . it is close to @xmath46 for @xmath47 and deviates it significantly for @xmath48 ( see figure [ spreadins ] ) .",
    "the average number of kinks ( @xmath49 ) evolves to a small constant value as @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) all along the freezing transition line",
    ". this value changes continuously by increasing the disorder strength . for @xmath52 only a single kink survives ( @xmath53 ) , while for other values see table [ freezt ] .    in the frozen ( active ) phase in the long time limit pairs within the same block annihilate and basically lonely kinks are wandering in confined regions of sizes @xmath54 ( local @xmath55 reactions are also permitted with a small probability ) .",
    "therefore the density of frozen kinks depend on the density of blocks , hence on @xmath44 .",
    "the concentration of blocks @xmath56 can be expressed with the average length @xmath57 of blocks as @xmath58 for the exponential block size distribution ( [ ldist ] ) the average block size is @xmath59 with the no - wall probability @xmath60 the kink density is @xmath61 which for small wall probability @xmath62 has the leading order singularity @xmath63 this means that in the frozen phase @xmath64 .",
    "the simulations confirm this . for @xmath65 , where only diffusion traps are present the",
    "@xmath66 indeed ( see table [ freezt ] and figure [ betafr ] ) .    for @xmath67 where annihilation is also blocked the exponent @xmath68 decreases by increasing @xmath44 ( see table [ freezt ] ) .",
    "we have also investigated the phase space for positive @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 ) where @xmath71 causes a direct freezing transition via diffusion traps in the absorbing phase .",
    "the density decay simulations ( see figure [ posdel ] ) show small deviations from the square - root law of arw ( [ sqrtlaw ] ) ) , which can be interpreted as corrections to scaling .",
    "we have investigated the phase diagram of the nekimca as the function of quenched disorder with large scale simulations .",
    "we have chosen nekimca , a very simple sca , which is known to exhibit pc class transition of kinks to absorbing states .",
    "we determined static and dynamic exponents ( @xmath72,@xmath68,@xmath73,@xmath45 ) at several points along the phase transition line and in the inactive phase .",
    "the main consequence of this survey is that weak disorder does not change the scaling behavior of the quantities studied .",
    "this supports the results of a recent real space rg study @xcite but contradicts the harris criterion",
    ".    a possible resolution of this contradiction could be the study of the distribution of the critical point coordinates over the ensemble of samples of size @xmath74 .",
    "according to recent progresses in the finite size scaling theory of disordered systems , thermodynamic observable are not self - averaging at critical points when the disorder is relevant in the harris criterion sense @xcite .",
    "this lack of self - averageness at criticality is directly related to the distribution of pseudo - critical temperatures @xmath75 over the ensemble of samples @xmath76 of size @xmath74 .",
    "this has been shown numerically in case of a wetting transition of a polymer chain with quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "an interesting further direction of research would be the study of those distributions for nonequilibrium systems like for nekimca .    for weak disorder ( @xmath77 ) we did not see deviations from the asymptotic square root power - law ( [ sqrtlaw ] ) in the inactive phase .",
    "however for stronger disorder continuously changing density decay exponent ( @xmath72 ) were observed .",
    "this corroborates a former rg study @xcite for arw with site dependent reaction rates and an exact calculation for the infinite reaction rate arw with disordered diffusion traps @xcite .",
    "very strong disorder in our model may introduce complete blocking of reactions or diffusion with exponential domain size distribution . if the system becomes segmented by diffusion walls a freezing transition to fluctuating states occur . in this case in odd parity blocks residual particles remain active .",
    "large scale simulations suggest that this kind of disorder is marginal , the density decay slows down from the ( [ sqrtlaw ] ) power - law by a logarithmic correction or changes continuously if the annihilation is blockaded too . in the frozen phase the concentration of residual kinks increases logarithmically , with @xmath78",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite , who considered the arw model with complete blockades .",
    "however we did not see crossover to stretched exponential decay reported in @xcite for long times , but rather the decay slows down in our model .",
    "this is due to the fact that in our model in the frozen state not only blockades exist , but reaction and diffusion probabilities are randomized , which can introduce slower power - laws @xcite .    in the region of the phase diagram where the disorder is so strong that the annihilation reaction becomes segmented we found continuously changing exponents along the disordered pc and the freezing transition lines both .",
