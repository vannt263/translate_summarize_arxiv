    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath3 ) are an important cosmological class of galaxies as they are the main contributors to the co - moving star formation rate density of the universe at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the mid - ir spectra of high redshift ( @xmath5 ) very luminous ir galaxies ( @xmath6 ) appear to be better reproduced with those of local starbursts and lirgs .",
    "this may just reflect the fact that at high - z star - formation was taking place over a few kiloparsec scales rather than in very compact ( @xmath7kpc ) regions .",
    "we used the spectral mapping capability of irs on spitzer with low ( sl+ll modules , @xmath8 , @xmath9 m ) and high ( sh+lh modules , @xmath10 , @xmath11 m ) spectral resolution ( see @xcite for details ) to observe 12 local ( distances of @xmath1275mpc ) lirgs selected from the sample of @xcite .",
    "the maps cover the central @xmath0 or @xmath13 regions of the galaxies .",
    "the spectral data cubes were assembled with cubism @xcite .",
    "we fitted the brightest emission lines in the cubes using gaussians for the emission lines and an order one polynomial for the local continuum .",
    "we obtained spectral maps of the line fluxes , line ratios , fwmhs and velocities ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the spectral maps allow us to select regions of interest in each galaxy and extract 1d spectra to study their physical properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "amorphous silicate grains have a broad absorption feature centered at @xmath16 m .",
    "to measure its depth we used a method similar to that proposed by spoon et al . @xcite .",
    "the continuum at @xmath17 m is estimated by fitting a power law through free feature continuum pivots at @xmath18 m and @xmath19 m .",
    "the silicate strength is defined as : @xmath20 .",
    "assuming an extinction law and a dust geometry the silicate strength can be converted into visual extinction .",

    ", width=389 ]        we used two independent methods to detect agn .",
    "the first method is the detection of high ionization emission lines such as , [ nev ] at 14.3 and 24.3@xmath15 m ( 97.1ev ) and [ oiv ] at 25.9@xmath15 m ( 54.9ev ) .",
    "the high ionization potential of these lines implies the presence of an agn because stars can not generally produce such amount of ionizing radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] right ) . the second method , proposed by nardini et al .",
    "@xcite , uses the @xmath21 m spectral region to separate out the starburst component in the form of pah emission and the agn component in the form of hot dust continuum , as can be seen from fig .",

    "the dotted blue lines represent the starburst component and the dot - dash red lines are the agn component seen as hot dust continuum .",
