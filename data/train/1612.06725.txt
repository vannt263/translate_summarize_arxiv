    "approximately at the time when helge holden was born the physicist eugene wigner presented a result in @xcite that may be considered to be the starting signal for an extremely fruitful line of investigations creating the now ample realm of random matrices .",
    "the reader may consult the handbook @xcite to obtain an impression of the richness of the field .",
    "its ongoing briskness is well documented by over 700 publications listed in mathscinet after the print of @xcite in 2011 .    in view of later developments that often use heavy machinery to provide very detailed knowledge about specific spectral statistics , wigner s observation impresses by its simplicity and fine combinatorics . for certain matrix ensembles , which in various generalizations are nowadays called _",
    "wigner ensembles _ , he was able to determine the limiting density of eigenvalues by the _",
    "moment method_. more precisely , he computed the expectations of all moments of the _ eigenvalue distribution measures _ in the limit of matrix dimensions tending to infinity .",
    "furthermore , he observed that these limits agree with the moments of the _ semicircle distribution _ thus proving the semicircle law that bears his name ( see sections [ ssec : scl - setup ] and [ ssec : scl - wigner ] for definitions of the phrases in italics ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the moment method continues to provide new insights into the distribution of random eigenvalues . with this article",
    "we take the reader on a tour that starts with wigner s discovery and ends with the description of recent results , some yet unpublished . along the way we try to explain a few developments in more detail while briefly pointing at others .    the first application of the moment method to the analysis of random eigenvalues appears almost accidental .",
    "in an effort to understand `` the wave functions of quantum mechanical systems which are assumed to be so complicated that statistical considerations can be applied to them '' wigner introduces in @xcite three types of ensembles of `` real symmetric matrices of high dimensionality '' .",
    "although he considers his results not satisfactory from a physical point of view , he expresses the hope that `` the calculation which follows may have some independent interest '' .",
    "moreover , the reader learns that one of the three models considered just serves `` as an intermediate step '' . and",
    "it is only this auxiliary ensemble that we would now call a wigner ensemble .",
    "wigner names it the `` random sign symmetric matrix '' by which he understands @xmath1 matrices for which the diagonal elements are zero and  non diagonal elements @xmath2 have all the same absolute value but random signs \" .    in the short note @xcite that appeared a few years later , wigner remarks that the arguments of @xcite show the semicircle law for a much larger class of real symmetric ensembles .",
    "he observes that , except for technical assumptions , two features of the model were essential for his proof : firstly , stochastic independence of the matrix entries ( as far as the symmetry permits ) and , secondly , that all ( or at least most ) matrix entries are centered and have the same variance .    in section [ ssec : scl - wigner ] we present wigner s proof with enough detail to make the significance of these two assumptions apparent .",
    "the remaining sections are then devoted to the discussion of results where at least one of these essential assumptions are weakened .    in section [ ssec",
    ": scl - band ] independence and centeredness of the matrix entries are kept .",
    "however , we allow the variances to vary as a function of the distance to the diagonal . the most prominent examples in this class are band matrices and we discuss them in detail .    a first step to loosen the assumption of independence is presented in section [ ssec : scl - sparse ] .",
    "its central result provides conditions on the number and location of matrix entries that may be dependent without affecting the validity of wigner s reasoning .",
    "we call such dependence structures _",
    "sparse_. sparse dependence structures appear for example in certain types of block random matrices that are used in modelling disordered systems in mesoscopic physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the last three sections [ ssec : scl - deccor][ssec : scl - ee ] we report on results for ensembles with a dependence structure that is not sparse .",
    "this is largely uncharted territory .",
    "however , in recent years a number of special cases were analyzed using the method of moments .",
    "they show interesting phenomena that should be explored further .",
    "we devide the models into three groups . in the first group the correlations decay to @xmath3 as",
    "the distance of the matrix entries becomes large in some prescribed metric .",
    "then we look at those ensembles for which the entries are drawn from curie - weiss random variables . here",
    "the correlations have no spatial decay but decay for supercritical temperatures as the matrix dimension becomes large . finally , we pick the matrix entries from an infinite sequence of exchangeable random variables . here",
    "the correlations between matrix entries depend neither on their locations nor on the size of the matrix .",
    "we close this introduction by stating what is not contained in this survey .",
    "one of the striking features of random matrix theory is the observation that local statistics of the eigenvalues obey universal laws that , somewhat surprisingly , have also arisen in certain combinatorial problems , in some models from statistical mechanics and even in the distribution of the non - trivial zeros of zeta - functions . by local statistics we mean statistics after local but deterministic rescaling so that the spacings between neighboring eigenvalues are of order @xmath4 .",
    "examples are the statistics of spacings or the distribution of extremal eigenvalues .",
    "such results were first obtained for gaussian ensembles , i.e.  wigner ensembles with normally distributed entries . in this special case",
    "it is possible to derive an explicit formula for the joint distribution of eigenvalues that can then be analyzed using the method of orthogonal polynomials . in the gaussian case this requires detailed asymptotic formulas for hermite polynomials of large degree that had already been derived in the beginning of the twentieth century .",
    "the first step to prove universality beyond gaussian ensembles was then taken about twenty years ago within the class of ensembles that are invariant under change of orthonormal bases .",
    "for such ensembles the eigenvectors are distributed according to haar measure , the joint distribution of eigenvalues is still explicit , and the method of orthogonal polynomials works , albeit they generally do not belong to the well studied families of classical orthogonal polynomials ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is only seven years ago that universality results for local statistics became available for wigner matrices ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since all of these results do not use the moment method , we will not discuss them in this paper .",
    "there is one notable exception to what has just been said .",
    "the distribution of extremal eigenvalues ( and consequently of the operator norm ) can and has been investigated for wigner ensembles on the local level , using the method of moments @xcite . however",
    ", this requires quite substantial extensions of the ideas that we explain and goes way beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore only state weaker results that might be considered as laws of large numbers for the operator norm and that can be proved with much less effort .",
    "nevertheless , we do not discuss their proofs either and refer the reader to section 2.3 of the textbook @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that the moment method can also be applied to complex hermitian matrices and to sample covariance matrices ( also known as wishart ensembles ) , but in the present article we always restrict ourselves to the case of real symmetric matrices to keep the presentation as elementary as possible .",
    "we begin by setting the scene and fixing some notation .    a ( real symmetric ) _ matrix ensemble _ is a family    @xmath5 of real valued random variables on a probability space @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "we then denote by @xmath8 the corresponding @xmath9-matrix , i.e.    @xmath10    since we deal exclusively with real symmetric matrices by matrix ensemble we always mean a real symmetric one .",
    "[ def : wigner ] a ( real symmetric ) matrix ensemble is called _ independent _ if for each @xmath11 the random variables @xmath12 are independent . it is called _ identically distributed _ , if all @xmath13 have the same distribution . + an independent and identically distributed matrix ensemble @xmath8 is called a _ wigner ensemble if @xmath14 and @xmath15 _ .    by a slight abuse of language we use the phrase @xmath8",
    "is a wigner matrix to indicate that the family @xmath8 of random ( symmetric ) matrices form a wigner ensemble .",
    "some authors allow for wigner ensembles a probability distribution for the diagonal elements which differs from the distribution for the nondiagonal entries .",
    "[ def : moments ] the _ @xmath16 moment _ of a random variable @xmath17 is the expectation @xmath18 .",
    "we say that all moments of @xmath17 exist , if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .    unless stated otherwise we always assume that all random variables occurring in this text have all moments existing .    for any symmetric @xmath9-matrix @xmath21 we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "we order these eigenvalues such that @xmath23 where degenerate eigenvalues are repeated according to their multiplicity .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution measure @xmath24 of @xmath21 is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the number of points in @xmath27 - as above - is the dimension of the matrix @xmath21 , @xmath28 is a borel - subset of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the dirac measure in @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32    it turns out that for a wigner matrix @xmath8 the eigenvalue distribution measure @xmath24 of @xmath8 has no chance to converge as @xmath33 as the following back - of - the - envelope calculations show .",
    "we have @xmath34    if the @xmath9-matrix @xmath8 has entries @xmath35 ( random or not ) , then shows @xmath36    and if the @xmath8 are random matrices with @xmath15 we get @xmath37    this shows that ( at least the second moment of ) the eigenvalue distribution measure of @xmath8 is divergent .",
    "moreover , the same calculation suggests that the eigenvalue distribution measure of the normalized matrices @xmath38 might converge as for @xmath39 @xmath40 as we shall see below , this is indeed the case not only for wigner ensembles , but for a huge class of random matrices .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to the operator norm of a matrix ensemble @xmath8 : @xmath41 since for any real symmetric @xmath9-matrix @xmath21 : @xmath42 a matrix @xmath21 with @xmath35-entries satisfies @xmath43 and similarly for @xmath15 @xmath44 again , one is lead to look at the norm of @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , for wigner ensemble the norm of @xmath39 will stay bounded as @xmath46 , in fact , it will converge to 2",
    ".    however , this fact is more subtle than the convergence of @xmath24 , and so is its proof ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : wignernorm ] that was proved by fredi and komlos in @xcite , see also @xcite , and @xcite for a textbook presentation ) .    to illustrate this ,",
    "let us look at a particular example within the class considered in , namely the @xmath9-matrices @xmath47 the matrix @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the orthogonal projection onto the vector @xmath51 , with @xmath52 for@xmath53 .",
    "consequently @xmath48 is of rank 1 and    @xmath54    thus we obtain @xmath55 but the eigenvalue distribution function @xmath24 of @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 means weak convergence ( see definition [ def : wconv ] ) .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the classical semicircle law for wigner ensembles .",
    "so , let @xmath8 be a wigner ensemble ( see definition [ def : wigner ] ) , set @xmath45 and denote the eigenvalue distribution measure of @xmath39 by @xmath59 , thus @xmath60 the semicircle law , in its original form due to wigner ( @xcite , @xcite ) , states that @xmath59 converges to the semicircle distribution @xmath61 given through its lebesgue density    @xmath62    @xmath61 describes a semicircle of radius 2 around the origin , hence the name .",
    "so far , we have avoided to explain in which sense @xmath59 converges .",
    "this is what we do now .",
    "let us first look at the convergence of measures on @xmath29 .",
    "[ def : wconv ] suppose @xmath63 and @xmath64 are probability measures on @xmath29 ( equipped with the borel @xmath61-algebra ) .",

    "if the matrix @xmath8 is random and @xmath68 is the eigenvalue distribution measure of @xmath69 then the measure @xmath59 itself is random .",
    "consequently , we have not only to define in which sense the measures converge ( namely weakly ) , but also how this convergence is meant with respect to randomness , i.e. to the ` parameter ' @xmath70 .",
    "there are various ways to do this .",

    "wigner @xcite proved this theorem for weak convergence in expectation .",
    "grenander @xcite showed under the same conditions that the convergence holds weakly in probability .",
    "arnold @xcite proved that the convergence is weakly @xmath77-almost surely .",
    "he also relaxed the moment condition to @xmath83 for @xmath77-almost sure weak convergence and to @xmath84 for weak convergence in probability .",
    "according to defition [ def : wigner ] the entries in a wigner ensemble are independent and identically distributed , so condition @xmath82 actually implies @xmath85 for each @xmath86 .",
    "besides the moment method we discuss in this article there is another important technique to prove the semicircle law .",
    "this is the stieltjes transform method originating in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite and references given there .",

    "so , at a first glance , the normalizing factor @xmath94 seems too small to compensate the growth of the sum .",

    "eulerian circuits_. they occur for example in the famous problem of the ` seven bridges of knigsberg ' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a eulerian circuit implies in particular that the multigraph is connected .",

    "<S> we then discuss variations of this classical result for ensembles for which the variance may depend on the distance of the matrix entry to the diagonal , including in particular the case of band random matrices , and/or for which the required independence of the matrix entries is replaced by some weaker condition . </S>",
    "<S> this includes results on ensembles with entries from curie - weiss random variables or from sequences of exchangeable random variables that have been obtained quite recently .    </S>",
    "<S> primary 60-b20 ; secondary 82-b44 .    </S>",
    "<S> random matrices , moment method , wigner matrices , curie - weiss ensembles , semicircle law    _ dedicated to helge holden on the occasion of his 60@xmath0 birthday _ </S>"
