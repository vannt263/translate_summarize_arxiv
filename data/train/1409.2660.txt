    "often uses the coulomb gauge . in coulomb",
    "gauge the scalar potential is instantaneous and the vector potential is purely transverse .",
    "the scalar potential represents coulomb interactions between the carriers while the vector potential represents photon interactions .",
    "if the two objects are not too far away from each other one may neglect retardation effects ( effects from the finite speed of light in vacuum ) .",
    "then only the coulomb interactions contribute and the properties of the materials enter in terms of the density - density correlation functions . if retardation has to be taken into account the photon interactions have to be included and , in this additional contribution , the properties of the materials enter in terms of the current - current correlation functions . the interaction can be found using many - body theory@xcite with diagrammatic perturbation theory based on feynman diagrams .",
    "alternatively the interaction can be viewed as caused by fluctuations , fluctuations in the charge and current densities or fluctuations in the electromagnetic fields .",
    "then one way to find the interaction is in terms of the electromagnetic normal modes of the system.@xcite these normal modes are massless bosons and at zero temperature the interaction energy is the sum of the zero - point energy of all these modes .    in a translational invariant and homogeneous system",
    "there are three types of normal mode ; two with transverse fields and one with longitudinal fields . in the present system",
    "there are only two types of normal mode ; one with @xmath0-polarized fields , i.e. , with electric vector in the plane formed by the in - plane momentum @xmath1 and the normal to the layers , experienced as longitudinal in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) sheets ; one with @xmath2-polarized fields , i.e. , with electric vector perpendicular to this plane , experienced as transverse in the 2d sheets . the first type of mode is called tm ( transverse magnetic ) and second te ( transverse electric ) .",
    "the dispersion curves for each mode type can have one or several branches .    for planar structures the quantum number that characterizes the normal modes is * k * , the 2d wave vector in the plane of the interfaces or planar structures and the interaction energy per unit area for each mode type can be written as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the area of a planar interface and the summation over @xmath5 is a summation over the branches . to get the expression on the right - hand side we have let @xmath4 be large so that the summation over the discrete @xmath1 variable can be replaced by an integral over a continuous @xmath1 variable .    after using an extension of the so - called argument principle and deforming",

    "the integral over frequency has been replaced by a summation over discrete frequencies , the so - called matsubara frequencies.@xcite the prime on the summation sign indicates that the @xmath10 term should be divided by two .",
    "the normal modes can be found in different ways .",
    "one way is to solve maxwell s equations ( in absence of any external sources ) in all regions of the system and use the proper boundary conditions at the interfaces .",
    "another way is to find self - sustained solutions using induced charge- and current - densities in the objects .",
    "we here derive the dispersion interaction in a variety of ways . since the non - retarded treatment is much easier to perform we present both the non - retarded and fully retarded derivations in separate sections . in the derivations involving normal modes",
    "we derive the mode condition function , @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction energy is then found by inserting this function into ( [ equ2 ] ) or ( [ equ3 ] ) . in the derivations involving diagrammatic perturbation theory",
    "the interaction energy is obtained directly .",
    "we do not present any numerical results , only the final expressions and different ways to arrive at these .",
    "however , we give the analytical expressions for the dielectric function of graphene and of the 2d electron gas so it is straight forward for the readers to perform numerical derivations of their own .",
    "numerical results for graphene by us and others can be found in the literature.@xcite    we begin in section [ not ] with introducing our notation .",
    "the following two sections are devoted to background materials , electromagnetic in section [ embg ] and 2d in section [ bg2d ] .",
    "the main results when retardation effects are neglected are derived in section [ nonret ] and when retardation effects are taken into account in section [ ret ] .",
    "we end in section [ sum ] with a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "in this work we discuss planar structures .",
    "we let all surfaces , interfaces and 2d films be parallel to the @xmath12-plane . we let @xmath13 be a three - dimensional ( 3d ) wave vector and",
    "@xmath14 its 2d in - plane component .",
    "the corresponding notation for the spatial coordinates are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "thus we have @xmath17 we will end up with a formalism only depending on @xmath14 and @xmath16 apart from the distances between the various interfaces . thus the formalism is 2d .",
    "we will make extensive use of the fourier transform , both the 3d and 2d versions , and since they can be defined in different ways we list our definitions here .",
    "the 3d fourier transform and inverse fourier transform of a function @xmath18 with only spatial dependence are @xmath19 if the function also has a temporal dependence the corresponding relations are @xmath20 in 2d the fourier transform and inverse fourier transform of a function are @xmath21 if the function has only spatial dependence .",
    "if the function also has a temporal dependence the relations are @xmath22 we will need yet another fourier transform .",
    "we let the function @xmath18 be a function of the 3d spatial variable @xmath15 but we only transform with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "then we have for a function with only spatial dependence @xmath23 if the function also has a temporal dependence the relations are @xmath24 note that we have refrained from introducing separate function names for the different fourier transformed versions of a function . by looking at the argument of the function we can tell if it is a 3d or 2d fourier transform , a partial transform , or not a transform at all .",
    "this section has two subsections . in the first , section [ me ]",
    ", we present the proper version of maxwell s equations and also the boundary conditions at interfaces in the system . in the second , section [ pot ] , we give the scalar and vector potentials in coulomb and lorentz gauges and show how the fields are obtained from these .",
    "there are different formulations of electromagnetism in the literature .",
    "the difference lies in how the conduction carriers are treated . in one formulation",
    "these carriers are lumped together with the external charges to form the group of free charges .",
    "then only the bound charges contribute to the screening .",
    "we want to be able to treat geometries with metallic regions .",
    "then this formulation is not suitable . in the formulation that we use",
    "the conduction carriers are treated on the same footing as the bound charges .",
    "thus , both bound and conduction charges contribute to the dielectric function . in the two formalisms the * e * and * b * fields , the true fields , of course are the same . however , the auxiliary fields , the * d * and * h * fields , are different . to indicate that we use this alternative formulation",
    "we put a tilde above the * d * and * h * fields and also above the dielectric functions , polarizabilities and conductivities .    with this formulation",
    "maxwell s equations ( mes ) have the form @xmath25 and the boundary conditions at an interface between two media @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are volume charge and current densities , respectively , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are surface charge and current densities , respectively .",
    "we note that the sources to the fields in mes are the external charge and current densities and also in the boundary conditions discontinuities in the normal component of the @xmath33 fields and tangential component of the @xmath34 fields are caused by external surface charge densities and external surface current densities , respectively .",
    "the unit vector * n * is the surface normal pointing into region @xmath27 .",
    "often it is easier to deal with potentials instead of the fields .",
    "the potentials are auxiliary functions , help functions .",
    "the potentials are not unique , they depend on which gauge we have chosen .",
    "two very common gauges used in condensed matter theory are the coulomb gauge ( mentioned in the introduction ) and the lorentz gauge . in coulomb",
    "gauge the potentials are @xmath35 here the scalar potential , @xmath36 , is instantaneous ; it describes the coulomb interaction between the charged carriers ; the coulomb interaction is purely longitudinal .",
    "the vector potential , @xmath37 , is retarded and transverse ; it describes the photon interactions between the charged particles ; the photon interactions are purely transverse . the potentials in coulomb gauge are not lorentz invariant .",
    "however , they are in lorentz gauge , @xmath38 here both potentials are retarded . in all gauges",
    "the relations between the true fields and the potentials are the same , viz .",
    "when retardation effects are neglected ( @xmath40 ) both gauges coincide and the only potential that remains is the instantaneous scalar potential .",
    "the different versions of the fourier transform of the function @xmath41 appear many times in the derivations so we compile the results in this subsection .",
    "this function is the coulomb potential between two electrons , @xmath42 , stripped of the charges .",
    "the 3d fourier transform is @xmath43 the 2d fourier transform performed over a plane the distance @xmath44 from the @xmath12-plane is @xmath45 the 2d fourier transform performed over the @xmath12-plane is @xmath46 these relations appear in expressions involving the scalar potential in coulomb gauge and when retardation effects are negligible .",
    "when retardation is important the function has a temporal dependence , @xmath47 .",
    "then the following fourier transforms are important : the 3d fourier transform , @xmath48 the 2d fourier transform performed over a plane the distance @xmath44 from the @xmath12-plane , @xmath49 the 2d fourier transform performed over the @xmath12-plane , @xmath50 where in the last two equations @xmath51    we will need one further relation , viz .",
    "when dealing with a 2d layer above a substrate it is fruitful to be able to find the image charge- and current - densities produced in the substrate .",
    "we start from a given time dependent charge- and current - density in the 2d layer , calculate the potentials and from these the @xmath53- and @xmath54-fields .",
    "we make an ansatz for the image densities and determine these by using the standard boundary conditions . here , we use the lorentz gauge in which the scalar and vector potentials are given in ( [ equ14 ] ) . both are convolution integrals of the type @xmath55 which has the nice property that @xmath56 . in the case of the scalar potential",
    "these functions are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . for the vector potential @xmath59 and @xmath58 , respectively . thus using ( [ equ19 ] )",
