    "the goal of this paper is to bring together some results of euler and his followers on spherical geometry . by the word",
    " followers \" , we mean the mathematicians who benefited from euler s teaching ; some of them were his students , and others were his assistants or young collaborators .",
    "most of them became eventually his colleagues at the academy of sciences of saint petersburg .",
    "these works of euler and his followers contain a wealth of ideas that have not got the attention they deserve from the working geometers .",
    "the results that we survey can be classified into three categories .",
    "the first set of results concern spherical trigonometry .",
    "euler wrote several papers on that subject , in which he derived a complete set of trigonometric formulae for the sphere .",
    "an important contribution in one of the memoirs that we review here is the introduction of the newly discovered methods of the calculus of variations .",
    "this allowed euler to give intrinsic proofs of the spherical trigonometric formulae that are based on the differential geometry of the sphere , unlike the classical proofs where the spherical formulae are derived from the euclidean , based on the fact that the lines are the intersections of the sphere with the euclidean planes passing by the origin .",
    "the second category of results that we survey consist of spherical analogues of euclidean theorems and constructions .",
    "the idea of examining the analogies between the euclidean and spherical geometry is very classical , and it can be traced back to the works of the greek mathematicians theodosius ( second century b.c . ) , menelaus ( first century a.d . ) , and ptolemy ( second century a.d . ) .",
    "understanding and proving the spherical analogues of euclidean theorems is sometimes not a trivial task , and some of the results obtained by these authors are difficult to prove .",
    "we shall mention several examples of such analogies in the works of euler and his students , and we shall present in detail two of them , together with some developments .",
    "the first result is a spherical analogue of a result in euclid s _ elements _ ( propositions 37 and its converse , proposition 39 , of book i ) .",
    "it characterizes the locus of the vertices of triangles with fixed base and fixed area .",
    "the second result is a spherical analogue of a construction by pappus ( proposition 117 of book vii of his _ collection _ ) of a triangle circumscribed in a circle such that the three lines containing the edges pass through three given points .",
    "( in pappus euclidean setting , the three points are aligned . )    the third category of results that we survey concern maps from the sphere into the plane . even if the motivation behind this research is the practical question of drawing geographic maps , the developments are purely mathematical .",
    "euler s main concern in this field is the characterization of maps from the sphere into the euclidean plane that preserve specific properties ( perpendicularity between the meridians and the parallels to the equator , preservation of area , infinitesimal similarity of figures , etc . )",
    "the classical stereographic projections are only one example of such maps .",
    "one important feature of most of the results established by euler on spherical geometry is the absence of use of solid geometry in the proofs , and the use of intrinsic methods of the sphere , including polarity theory .",
    "this tradition goes back to the work of menelaus , but this work was not known to euler .",
    "we have included in this paper some biographical notes on euler s collaborators , but not on him .",
    "there are several very good biographies of euler , and we refer the reader to the books of fellmann @xcite , spiess @xcite and du pasquier , @xcite , as well as to the moving tribute ( loge ) by fuss @xcite , and to the one by condorcet @xcite .",
    "the book by fellmann reproduces a short autobiography which euler dictated to his oldest son johann albrecht .. ] we only mention that spherical geometry is one of many fields in which the contribution of euler is of major importance .",
    "the volume @xcite contains articles on several aspects of the works of euler on mathematics , physics and music theory .",
    "before reporting on the works of euler , let us make some brief remarks on the history of spherical geometry .",
    "spherical geometry , as the study of the figures made by intersections of planes with the sphere , was developed by theodosius .",
    "menelaus inaugurated a geometrically intrinsic study of spherical triangles which is not based on the ambient euclidean solid geometry , but his work was ( and is still ) very poorly known , except for some quotes in the work of ptolemy .",
    "chasles , in his _ aperu historique _",
    "@xcite ( 1837 ) , after mentioning the early works on spherical geometry by theodosius , menelaus and ptolemy , adds the following ( p. 236 ) :  this doctrine [ of spherical lines and spherical triangles ] , which is almost similar to that of straight lines , is not all of spherical geometry .",
    "there are so many figures , starting from the most simple one , the circle , that we can consider on this curved surface , like the figures described in the plane .",
    "but it is only about forty years ago that such an extension has been introduced in the geometry of the sphere .",
    "this is due to the geometers of the north . \"",
    "he then mentions lexell and fuss , the two mathematicians who worked at the saint petersburg academy of sciences and who had been students of euler .",
    "for instance , fuss , in ( _ nova acta _ vol .",
    "ii and iii ) , studied _ spherical ellipses _ , that is , loci of points on the sphere whose the sum of distances to two fixed points ( called the foci ) is constant .",
    "fuss showed that this curve is obtained as the intersection of the sphere with a second degree cone whose centre is at the centre of the sphere .",
    "he also proved that if the sum of the two lengths is equal to half of the length of a great circle , then the curve on the sphere is a great circle , independently of the distance of the foci .",
    "some of the works of lexell and fuss on spherical geometry were pursued by schubert , another follower of euler , who also worked on loci of vertices of triangles satisfying certain properties .",
    "we shall talk in some detail about the works of these mathematicians , and in the last section of this paper , we shall give short biographical information on each of them .",
    "in all the discussion that follows , the distance on the sphere is the angular distance . in other words , we take the model of the unit sphere in 3-space , where the distance between two points is equal to the angle made by the two rays starting at the origin and passing through these points .",
    "a spherical triangle is defined by three points on the sphere together with three lines joining them , called the sides .",
    "the sides of a spherical triangle , being shortest lines , are segments of great circles , that is , they are arcs of intersections of the sphere with planes passing through the center . the angle made by two lines ( or great circles )",
    "is the dihedral angle made by the corresponding planes .",
    "the angle at a vertex of a triangle is the angle made by the two lines that contain the two sides that abut at that vertex .    in this section ,",
    "we give a brief account on the work of euler on spherical geometry .",
    "we shall give below a list of his main memoirs on the subject .",
    "the titles should give the reader some idea of their content .",
    "two dates are indicated after each paper ; these are the year where the paper was presented at the academy of sciences ( of saint petersburg or of berlin ) and the year where the paper was published .",
    "the date at which the paper was written is not necessarily the date at which it was presented .",
    "for this reason , it is sometimes difficult to make a chronology of the discoveries of euler , if we want to compare them to those of his students and collaborators on related matters .",
    "we know for instance that the memoir @xcite of euler , published in en 1797 , was presented at the academy of saint petersburg in 1778 , that is , 19 years before its publication . the work of lexell ( one of euler s students ) on the same subject was presented in 1781 and published in 1784 .",
    "the memoirs _ solutio facilis problematis , quo quaeritur sphaera , quae datas quatuor sphaeras utcunque dispositas contingat _ and",
    "_ geometrica et sphaerica quaedam _ were published in 1810 and 1815 respectively , that is , 27 and 32 years after euler s death ( in 1783 ) .",
    "the main reason for this delay is that the academies of sciences of saint petersburg and of berlin received too many of euler s memoirs and , since the number of pages of each volume the journal , was limited , the backlog became gradually substantial .",
    "starting from the year 1729 , and until 50 years after euler s death , his works filled about half of the scientific part of the _ actes _ of this academy . likewise , between the years 1746 and 1771 , about half of the scientific part of the _ mmoires _ of the academy of berlin consisted in papers by euler .",
    "the memoirs of euler continued to appear regularly in the _ actes _ of the saint petersburg academy , even during the years where he was in berlin ( 1741 - 1766 ) .",
    "we also know that euler , in some cases , purposely delayed the publication of some of his memoirs , in order to leave the primacy of the discoveries to others .",
    "this occurred especially in the case where his work and his colleague s work on the same subject were done independently and without knowledge of the others work .",
    "it also happened that sometimes euler considered that the approach of his colleague was better than than his .",
    "a famous example is the attitude he had towards lagrange s work on the calculus of variations , and we shall elaborate on this in  [ calculus ] below .",
    "this applies also to the work of some of his his students .",
    "such excessive generosity , which was typical of euler , is very rare in scientific circles .",
    "one can quote here condorcet ( @xcite p. 307 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ he never claimed any of his discoveries ; and if someone claimed something from his works , he was quick to repair such an unintentional unfairness , without too much examining whether the rigorous equity demanded from him an absolute withdrawal .",

    "we did not include in this list any of the memoirs by euler ( or by his students and followers ) on astronomy .",
    "they also contain results on spherical geometry , but the stress is on a different matter .",
    "we are interested here in spherical geometry as a mathematical field which is independent from the science of astronomy .",
    "we also did not mention papers by euler on geometrical problems in 3-space involving spheres ( there are several such papers ) , like the generalizations to spheres of the famous apollonian problem of constructing circles that are tangent to three given circles .",
    "such problems , even though they involve spheres , belong to euclidean geometry and not to spherical geometry .",
    "let us make a few comments on the papers in this list .",
    "the three papers ( [ e1 ] ) ( [ e2 ] ) ( [ e8 ] ) are on spherical trigonometry and we shall elaborate on them in  [ sph ] .    in the paper ( [ e4 ] ) , euler gives a proof of the formula attributed to girard for the area of triangles as the angular excess .",
    "can be defined as the _ angular excess _ of this triangle , that is , @xmath0 .",
    "it is well - known that any area function on subsets of the sphere which satisfies the usual additivity properties is , when restricted to triangles , the angular excess ( up to a constant factor ) .",
    "] he also gives several other formulae for the area of a triangle in terms of the side lengths .",
    "we shall comment on these important formulae in  [ s : area ] .",
    "in the same paper , euler uses spherical geometry in order to compute the dihedral angles between the faces of each of the five platonic solids .",
    "the three papers ( [ e5 ] ) ( [ e6 ] ) ( [ e7 ] ) are on cartography , and more precisely on mappings from the sphere to the euclidean plane , which produce geographical maps .",
    "we shall comment on them in  [ s : maps ] .",
    "the two papers ( [ e3 ] ) ( [ e10 ] ) are on curves on spheres and on spheroids , and we shall report on them in  [ s : alg ] .    in the memoir ( [ e11 ] ) , euler provides a new formula for the area of a triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides .",
    "we shall elaborate on this question in ",
    "[ s : area ] below . in the same memoir",
    ", he considers the question of finding the locus of the vertices of spherical triangles that have a fixed base and a given area .",
    "this is the spherical analogue of a result in euclid s _ elements_. in the euclidean case , the required locus is a straight line parallel to the line containing the base of the triangle .",
    "see heath s translation of the _ elements _ , @xcite p. 332 - 333 .",
    "the analogous result in spherical geometry is a theorem which euler attributes to his student lexell .",
    "we shall report on this important result and its developments in  [ s : lexell ] below .",
    "the memoir ( [ e13 ] ) contains results on euclidean plane geometry and their analogues in spherical geometry .",
    "one starts with a triangle and three segments , each of them joining one vertex of the triangle to a point on the line containing the opposite side .",
    "the question is then to find a condition for the three lines containing the three given segments to intersect in one point .",
    "denoting by @xmath1 the vertices of the triangles , @xmath2 the three points on the opposite sides and @xmath3 the intersection point of the three lines ( figure [ concourantes ] ) , euler obtains , in the euclidean case , the relation @xmath4 and in the spherical case , @xmath5 in other words , the condition for the three lines to be concurrent is the same up to replacing the lengths of the sides by the tangents of these lengths .",
    "mathematicians know that such a resemblance is not fortuitous , and it can be explained .",
    "we shall see other such analogies below .",
    "the same memoir contains other results , which are again proved first in the euclidean case and then in the spherical case .",
    "in particular , euler proves the following converse of the relation ( [ eq : euler ] ) :    given three segments @xmath6 meeting at the same point @xmath3 and satisfying the relation ( [ eq : euler ] ) , we can construct a triangle with vertices @xmath1 such that the three points @xmath2 are on the opposite sides .",
    "he then obtains , as corollaries , the following relations which are valid in any triangle , in the euclidean and the spherical cases respectively :    @xmath7    @xmath8    it seems that none of these results , in the euclidean as well as in the spherical case , was known before euler .",
    "the result ( [ eq : euler22 ] ) ( in the euclidean case ) is discussed in the paper @xcite .",
    "there is a well - known relation satisfied by three segments @xmath9 , in the situation considered by euler , so that the three lines they generate are concurrent , namely , _ ceva s theorem_. this is the relation @xmath10 euler s relations ( [ eq : euler ] ) and ( [ eq : euler22 ] ) are different .    in the memoir ( [ e9 ] )",
    "@xcite , euler formulates a problem which is more general than a problem which was solved by pappus , and he solves it in the euclidean and in the spherical cases . the problem is to construct a triangle which is inscribed in a given circle and such that the sides are contained in lines passing through three given points .",
    "the construction of pappus concerns the case where the three points are aligned .",
    "we shall mention some developments of this question in  [ s : pappus ] below .",
    "let us return now to the paper _ principes de la trigonomtrie sphrique tirs de la mthode des plus grands et des plus petits _ @xcite .    as announced in the title",
    ", euler uses in the proofs of the spherical trigonometric formulae the  method of maxima and minima \" , which was the name that he used for the calculus of variations .",
    "the application of these methods to spherical geometry is based on the fact that the edge of a triangle is the shortest path between its extremities .",
    "the methods of the calculus of variations are then used to find the relations between the six elements of the triangle , namely , the three side lengths and the three angles . in the introduction of the memoir @xcite",
    ", euler writes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ since the sides of a spherical triangle are the smallest lines that one can draw from an angle to another one , the method of maxima and minima can be used to determine the sides of a spherical triangle ; and from there we can find after that the relation that remains between the angles and the sides .",
    "this is precisely the subject of spherical trigonometry . _",

    "the arc @xmath11 is on the equator , @xmath13 on a meridian , and we are searching for the length of the arc @xmath15 .",
    "this arc is produced infinitesimally until the point @xmath18 . setting @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", euler obtains several formulae which solve the problem . among them ,",
    "the most well known is probably    @xmath22    this is the so - called _ spherical pythagorean theorem_. other formulae are easily deduced from this one , for instance :    @xmath23    a few remarks may be useful to the reader who might not be aware of the basics of spherical geometry ; they will help him make the relation with the well - known formulae of euclidean geometry .",
    "let us make the three edges of the triangle @xmath24 very small while keeping the angle @xmath25 constant .",
    "we then use the second order taylor expansions @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the formulae ( [ pythagore ] ) and ( [ sinus ] ) become respectively @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are well - known formulae of euclidean geometry : the first one is the usual pythagoras theorem and the second one is just the definition of the sine function .    these formulae , which are valid for infinitesimal spherical triangles , reflect the fact that infinitesimally , spherical geometry is euclidean .    let us also recall that the formulae ( [ pythagore ] ) and ( [ sinus ] ) assume a certain normalization which comes from working on a sphere of radius one . for a sphere of a different radius , a certain constant which depends on this radius appears in the formulae .    the memoir @xcite contains 11 fundamental results , with several corollaries for each of them . after the trigonometric formulae for spherical triangles , euler establishes formulae for arbitrary triangles .",
    "he transforms systematically each formula he obtains in all possible manners , even if the result is redundant ; see for instance the table in figure [ table ] for a spherical triangle with a right angle at @xmath30 , in which given two quantities in a triangle ( for instance , the two sides @xmath31 ad @xmath32 ) , one has an expression for a third quantity ( the side @xmath33 , or the angle @xmath16 , or the angle @xmath34 ) .",
    "this kind of redundancy is not unusual in euler s writings and it was probably due to his pedagogical convictions .        in the same memoir , euler obtains the formula for the area of a spherical triangle as the angular excess ( girard s theorem which we already mentioned ) and other formulae , like the value of the angles of a triangle in terms of the side lengths , and conversely , values of side lengths in terms of the angles .",

    "one of the main ingredients in the memoir @xcite , in the application of the method of the calculus of variations , is the fact that at the infinitesimal level , the geometry of the sphere is euclidean .",
    "thus , for instance , in the solution of the problem of finding the shortest line between two points on the sphere ( problem vi , p. 235 of @xcite ) , and using the notation of equations ( [ pythagore ] ) and ( [ sinus ] ) and denoting the infinitesimal arc arcs @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 by @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , the length element @xmath38 is written as @xmath41 this formula is obtained by applying the euclidean pythagorean formula to an infinitesimal right triangle .",
    "the problem is then to search for conditions on the length @xmath42 of a path joining two points so that this length is minimal .",
    "this leads to a differential equation and the trigonometric formulae are obtained by solving such differential equations .    after finding some basic trigonometric formulae using the calculus of variations ,",
    "other formulae are proved by algebraic transformations .",
    "the formula for the area of a triangle uses an integration .    beyond the obtention of trigonometric formulae , euler discovered , with his use of the calculus of variations , a version of the intrinsic differential geometry of surfaces , a theory which gauss and then riemann were about to develop more thoroughly , in the century that followed .",
    "one may add here that euler investigated , long before gauss , the differential geometry of surfaces embedded in 3-space .",
    "in 1772 , he studied developable surfaces and he obtained a criterion for two surfaces to be applicable on each other , a criterion which was rediscovered in 1828 by gauss . in 1763 , euler started a thorough study of curvature of embedded surfaces . in 1767 , he found an expression of the curvature in terms of the product of principal curvatures .    the memoir @xcite is another complete treatise on spherical trigonometry .",
    "there is however a major difference with the preceding one : euler does not use any more the variational methods to prove the trigonometric formulae , and instead he works them out in a classical manner , deriving them from solid geometry .",
    "in fact , he applies a spherical triangle onto a tangent plane passing through one of the vertices , using radial projection from the origin of the sphere .",
    "right at the beginning of the paper , he notes that the choice of the notation @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the angles and sides opposite to them leads to a set of symmetric formulae ; for instance , we have the following ( extracted from his paper ) : @xmath43{cos1.pdf}\\ ] ] @xmath43{cos2.pdf}\\ ] ]    this is also typical of euler s writing : to publish different proofs of the same result .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", euler highlights a rule for obtaining new formulae out of known ones , and this rule is no other than the duality theory in spherical geometry .",
    "we know by the way that until recently , the theory was attributed to vite , but we know now that it was discovered by the arabic mathematicians of the tenth century , see e.g. the historical work of marie - thrse debarnot @xcite .",
    "in fact , euler , in the paper @xcite to which we refer in ",
    "[ s : area ] , uses the notion of polar triangle , which is one way of explaining the symmetry of the formulae .",
    "he establishes , using solid geometry , the following three basic formulae , @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 and he then derives from them the rest of the trigonometric formulae , by performing algebraic transformations .",
    "several authors after euler worked out , like him ( and they were probably inspired by him ) , a complete system of trigonometric formulae based on very few starting formulae ; see e.g. lagrange @xcite and de gua @xcite .",
    "in this section , we give , for the convenience of the reader , a short introduction to the calculus of variations , since this theory plays an important role in the work of euler on spherical trigonometry . in some sense , this field is the study of certain extrema ( maxima and minima ) of functions defined on some space , usually infinite - dimensional .",
    "a typical example of space on which the function is defined is a space of maps .",
    "for instance , it could be a space of paths joining two given points on a surface , and we may ask that the paths are differentiable , or piecewise differentiable , etc . is regarded here as a map from the interval @xmath47 $ ] into @xmath48 . ]",
    "the domain considered may also be a space of surfaces , etc .",
    "a function defined on a space of functions is often called a _",
    "functional_. thus , the object of the calculus of variations is to determine the extrema of functionals .",
    "for instance , morse theory , which was born in the twentieth century and whose object is the study of submanifolds of a differentiable manifold , uses widely the techniques of the calculus of variations , the space of submanifolds being here the underlying infinite - dimensional space . in a certain sense ,",
    "the calculus of variations is a generalization of differential calculus where one studies extrema of functionals instead of extrema of functions .",
    "the idea of generalizing the notion of function to that of functional may seem trivial , but practically , the new theory involves a wealth of new delicate ideas as well as powerful tools .",
    "the functionals of which we study the extrema in the calculus of variations are usually defined by integrals . a typical example of a space on which the functional is defined is the space of paths between two fixed points and where the functional is the length function . a point where an extremum of this function is attained is a _",
    "geodesic_. the determination of geodesics , for instance on a surface , is a fundamental problem in geometry . to give an elementary example ,",
    "let us recall that in the euclidean plane , using cartesian coordinates , the length of a curve defined as the graph of a function @xmath49 defined on the interval @xmath47 $ ] is given by the integral @xmath50 one can see on this example that some hypotheses must be satisfied by the paths on which this functional is defined , e.g. that it should be differentiable ( but there are more restrictive hypotheses ) .",
    "in fact , one of the first papers that euler wrote concerns geodesics , _ de linea brevissima in superficie quacunque duo quaelibet puncta jungente _ ( on the shortest line joining two arbitrary points on a surface ) @xcite .",
    "he wrote it in 1728 , at the age of 21 .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is typical of the calculus of variations . working in a more general context",
    ", euler gives in this paper a necessary and sufficient condition for a path to be an extremum of the length functional , a condition which can be expressed by a differential equation which is called today the _ euler - lagrange equation_.    although the calculus of variations , as a field , was born with euler , there are problems which belong to that field which were studied prior to euler .",
    "let us mention a few of them .",
    "newton , in book ii of the _ principia _ , considered such problems , in the setting of the motion of objects in fluids .",
    "he searched for a geometric characterization of a surface of revolution moving at a constant speed in a fluid , in the direction of its axis , such that the air resistance exerted on this surface is minimal .",
    "the british clockmaker henry sully ( 1680 - 1729 ) , who owned a clock company in versailles , proposed an isochronal penduluma curve is said to be isochronal if it takes the same time for a body sliding on it without friction and starting at any point to get to the bottom , under the sole force of gravity .",
    "the cycloid is an example of such a curve . ] which euler studied later in his article @xcite , as a problem of calculus of variations .",
    "johann bernoulli ( 1667 - 1748 ) and his brother jakob ( 1654 - 1705 ) , as well as other mathematicians before euler , worked on a problem which is typical of the calculus of variations , namely , the _ brachistochrone _ , or the  curves which realizes the minimal time \" .",
    "this is a curve situated in a vertical plane on which a point , submitted to a constant gravitational field of the earth , sliding without friction , attains the lower point in a minimum amount of time .",
    "this curve is not a line ( unless the lower point lies on the same vertical ) .",
    "galileo , in his _ discourses and mathematical demonstrations concerning two new sciences _ ( theorem xxii , proposition xxxvi ) , searched for a characterization of this curve , and he concluded ( erroneously ) that it must be an arc of circle . and a point @xmath51 which is not on @xmath52 and which is subject to a constant gravitational field , the line segment on which @xmath51 can slide in order to attain in a minimum time a point on @xmath52 is the segment joining @xmath51 to a point @xmath53 of @xmath52 making with this line an angle of @xmath54 .",
    "the second step consists in proving that if we take a point @xmath55 on an arc of circle joining @xmath51 to @xmath53 , then if the point @xmath51 slides over the broken line @xmath56 , it attains the point @xmath53 more rapidly than if it slides on the first straight line . the third step ( the one which is not correct ) consist in deducing from this reasoning that the line that we are seeking for is an arc of a circle joining @xmath51 to @xmath53 .",
    "] the brachistochrone problem is a typical problem in the calculus of variations .",
    "the space on which the function is defined is the space of paths from @xmath51 to @xmath53 .",
    "the functional that is minimized in this setting is the time of descent , without friction .",
    "the question of determining the brachistochrone between two points has a long history .",
    "it was proposed by johann bernoulli in 1696 .",
    "bernoulli , who knew the answer , submitted the problem as a challenge to his colleagues.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the following year , newton , leibniz , lhospital , johann bernoulli himself and his brother jackob , published a solution , using different methods .",
    "jakob bernoulli showed that this curve was a cyclod .",
    "the method consisted in varying the curve at a given point and comparing it to the curve thus obtained .",
    "it was only after the death of jakob bernoulli ( 1705 ) that johann bernoulli admitted that the methods used by his brother were correct . in 1719",
    ", he published an exposition together with a commentary of these methods , where he extracted an equation which could be used as the basis of a general theory ( cf . @xcite p. 110 and 117 ) . in 1734 , euler generalized the problem of the brachistochrone taking into account the resistance of the ambient space , to questions of extrema of quantities that can be different from time .",
    "it is fair to note here that although there were problems that were considered before euler and that are typical of the calculus of variations , the methods used to solve them were geometric and not variational .",
    "for instance , geodesics on surfaces were characterized by properties of the osculating planes at these points .",
    "they did not involve the analytical methods which were introduced by euler and lagrange and which became the methods of the calculus of variations .    the article _ constructio linearum isochronarum in medio quocunque resistente _",
    "@xcite of euler , which concerns the construction of an isochronal curve . ] in a resistant medium , is his first published work ( he was 18 years old ) ; thus , it is by a work on the calculus of variations that euler started his scientific production .",
    "this subject pursued euler during the rest of his life , and several other questions concerning motion in a resistant medium were treated later in a much more exhaustive manner in his _ mechanica analytica _ ( 1736 ) .",
    "the article @xcite , as well as the article @xcite which we already mentioned and which concerns geodesics on surfaces , were also motivated by questions which were asked to euler by johann bernoulli .",

    "] since euler attributes the invention of this theory to lagrange , let us say a few words on the works of the latter",
    ".    in a letter dated august 12 , 1755 , lagrange , their exchanges , marked by a harmony in the intellectual interests , practically encompass all the branches of pure and applied mathematics .",
    "\" we can recall by the way that lagrange was the successor of euler at the academy of berlin , in 1766 , after the return of the latter to the academy of sciences of saint petersburg . on the other hand ,",
    "euler was very generous with lagrange , but the latter did not always express gratefulness to euler .",
    "it suffices to skim through the correspondence between lagrange and dalembert in order to see the condescending and sometimes derisive tone which lagrange uses when he talks about euler . ] who was only nineteen years old , explained to euler , who was thirty years older than him , new ideas he discovered on the calculus of variations .",
    "these ideas simplified the works of euler in the sense that they avoided delicate geometric arguments and replaced them by analytic arguments which lead directly to what was called later on the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "lagrange had already written to euler on june 28 , 1754 , on another subject , and the differentials of the product @xmath60 , and he asked euler about his opinion on this analogy whose discovery he considered as his own ; cf . _",

    "the following year , euler presented to the academy of sciences of berlin the new methods of lagrange .",
    "lagrange published his results in 1760 in an article titled _ essai dune nouvelle mthode pour dterminer les maxima et les minima des formules intgrales indfinies _ ( an essay for a new method for determining the maxima and the minima of indefinite integral formulae ) , which appeared in the _ miscellanea taurinensia _",
    ", a journal from turin .",
    "the article contains solutions to problems in the calculus of variations which are more general than those that euler studied .",
    "for instance , lagrange considers the brachistochrone problem with variable extremities .",
    "it is in this article that the so - called lagrange multipliers appear for the first time .",
    "we know that euler waited several years before publishing some of his papers on the calculus of variations , because he wanted the primacy of the discovery to go to lagrange .",
    "this is apparent in the correspondence between the two men ( which lasted 21 years ) ; cf .",
    "we learn in particular ( p. 421ff . )",
    "that at the birth of this theory , the works of euler were shading off those of lagrange , despite the efforts of euler to highlight those of his young colleague .",

    "we now return to spherical geometry .",
    "we consider , in this section and the next one , works on construction problems of triangles .",
    "we start with a work of lexell .",
    "section [ s : students ] of the present paper contains some biographical elements on lexell .",
    "lexell published a memoir titled _ solutio problematis geometrici ex doctrina sphaericorum _ ( the solution of a geometrical problem according to the spherical doctrine ) @xcite , in which he studied the locus of the vertices of triangles with a given base and fixed area .",
    "we mentioned this problem in the introduction .",
    "we recall that euclid in the _ elements _ solves the analogous euclidean problem , and the solution there , that is , the locus of the vertices of a triangle of fixed area and fixed base , is a line which is parallel to the base ( figure [ eucl ] ) .",
    "euclid calls two triangles having the same area _ equal_.",
    "the reason is that such triangles can be dissected in such a way that the pieces can be reassembled to lead to the same triangle .",
    "the same definition of  having the same area \" applies to spherical triangles .",
    "we recall by the way that euclid did not use the absolute notion of _ area _ , which was beyond his means .    in the spherical case ,",
    "the solution of the problem is not a line but a small circle which is _ not _ equidistant to the base of the triangle .",
    "let us report on the solution of lexell .",
    "we use his notation .",
    "we are looking for the locus of the vertex @xmath61 of a triangle @xmath62 with fixed base @xmath12 and with fixed area 2@xmath63 .",
    "( thus , the angle sum of the triangle @xmath62 is @xmath64 . )",
    "the locus that we are seeking is the segment of small circle @xmath65 represented in figure [ lexell1 ] .",
    "the construction is as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be the second intersection point of the lines @xmath12 and @xmath66 .",
    "( in other words , @xmath3 is the antipode of the point @xmath16 . ) let @xmath30 be the midpoint of @xmath12 and let @xmath67 be a line ( great circle ) perpendicular to @xmath12 at @xmath30 , where @xmath17 is the second intersection point of this line with the line @xmath12 .",
    "( thus , @xmath17 is the antipode of @xmath30 . ) from the point @xmath3 , consider the line @xmath14 , where @xmath51 is on @xmath68 and where the angle @xmath69 is equal to @xmath70 .",
    "finally , taking @xmath51 as a pole we draw the small circle at distance @xmath71 ; this circle passes through @xmath61 and it intersects the line @xmath67 at a point @xmath72 . the arc @xmath65 is the locus that we are looking for .",
    "let us note that the reasoning shows that the locus is a small circle that passes by the antipode of @xmath16 , and therefore the antipode of @xmath34 as well .    during the construction",
    ", lexell makes the following remarks ( @xcite ,  6 and 10 ) :     for any vertex @xmath61 of a triangle satisfying the requirements , the arc of great circle @xmath66 intersects the great circle containing the side @xmath12 at the same point @xmath3 , and we have @xmath73 , which is half of the distance @xmath12 .     there is a limiting case where the point @xmath61 is at @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the triangle @xmath74 becomes equal to a bigon @xmath75 .    ",
    "the segment @xmath71 is perpendicular to the line @xmath76 .    ",
    "the locus @xmath77 is always a segment of a _ small _ circle , except in the case where @xmath78 is a quarter of a circle , and in this case the locus @xmath77 is a segment of great circle .",
    "it is interesting to compare the solutions of lexell and of euler . in the memoir @xcite",
    ", euler declares that the impulse for studying this problem came to him from the result of lexell .    in  16 of @xcite , after giving the formula for the area of a spherical triangle in terms of its side lengths ,",

    "the figure @xmath88 is called a _ parallelogram _ because any two opposite sides ( even though they are not line segments of the geometry of the sphere ) are equal , and any two opposite angles are also equal ( euler proves this ) .",

    "note that these may not be spherical triangles in the usual sense because some of their sides may not be arcs of great circles .",

    "due to lexell , this theorem was generally known only through the _ lments de gomtrie _ of legendre who , although he attributed it to lexell , gives it in an incomplete manner , and he seems to have been followed by all the authors who talked about it after him . since i have been led in the memoir which i cited to recognize that  the small circle which is the locus of the vertices of the triangles of equal area constructed over the same base passes through the two antipodes of the extremities of the base \" , i was led to think that this complement , which was essential for the applications which i had in mind , was not known , and i was comforted in this error by all those who later on dealt with the same subject .",
    "it is only recently that mr .",
    "liouville , who made a review of the present memoir to the academy of sciences of paris , and having had the idea of resorting to the original memoir of lexell ( nova acta petrop . tom . v pars prima ) , recognized that the proposition in question is stated there in a complete manner and is proved in two different ways .",

    "the only original contribution of lebesgue in this paper consists in two remarks that he makes after the proof .",
    "the first remark says that one has an analogous result for surfaces of revolution which admit an equator , taking two curves that are equidistant to that equator .",
    "the second remark says that by taking the stereographic projection of the figure on the sphere , we get in the plane a family of curved triangles on a given base , whose angle sum is constant , and whose vertices are on the same circle .    a solution of the question underlying lexell s theorem can also be given by exhibiting an explicit formula for the area of a triangle of a fixed base and a variable third vertex .",
    "such a formula leads to an analytic equation for the third vertex and one can eventually show that this is the equation of a circle on the sphere .",
    "euler and lexell also followed this path in their papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another such approach was conducted by puissant in his _ trait de godsie , ou exposition des mthodes trigonomtriques et astronomiques _",
    "@xcite ( p. 115 ) .",
    "in this section , we present some important formulae by euler and his followers for the areas of spherical triangles .    the formula for areas of triangles is attributed to albert girard ( 1595 - 1632 ) , who stated it in his _ invention nouvelle en algbre _ ( 1629 ) .",
    "lagrange says in his paper @xcite that the solution of girard is not satisfying , and that the theorem should rather be attributed to cavalieri , who gave a compete proof in his _ directorium generale uranometricum _ ( a general guide to celestial measures , bologna , 1632 ) .",
    "lagrange , in the same paper , also refers to the  beautiful proof \" of wallis ( 1616 - 1703 ) .",
    "the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of angular excess was also found by thomas harriot ( 1560 - 1621 ) who did not publish it .    in his memoir _",
    "principes de la trigonomtrie sphrique tirs de la mthode des plus grands et des plus petits _ @xcite which we already mentioned",

    "( on the measure of solid angles ) @xcite , written in 1775 , he gives another proof of this theorem based on the notion of polar triangle is a spherical triangle @xmath133 whose sides @xmath134 are on arcs of great circles with poles @xmath1 .",
    "( thus , @xmath16 is a pole of the equator @xmath135 , etc . ) ] ( see figure [ polar1 ] ) .",
    "he starts with the fact that the area of a lunar part in figure [ polar1 ] .",
    "] of the sphere ( a region comprised between two arcs of great circle joining the same points ) of angle @xmath16 is equal to @xmath136 .",
    "the formula for the area of a triangle follows then from drawing the polar triangle , adding the areas of the three lunes obtained ( whose angles are those of the given triangle ) and subtracting the value of four areas of spherical triangles which can be easily compared to the area of the initial triangle .",
    "lagrange , in his 1800 memoir , does not mention the proof of euler .",
    "we also mention that the existence of the polar triangle is at the basis of the symmetry in the trigonometric formulae which is manifested by the fact that some of them can be obtained from others by exchanging the roles of angles and sides , as we already mentioned in  [ sph ] .",
    "let us now elaborate on the formulae for area in terms of side lengths .    in euclidean geometry ,",
    "the formula which gives the area of a triangle in term of the length of its sides is attributed to heron ( c. 1070 a.d . ) , the greek mathematician who worked , like euclid , in alexandria .",
    "using lexell s notation @xcite ( figure [ area - lexell ] here ) , we consider a triangle @xmath137 with sides @xmath138 opposite to the vertices @xmath139 respectively .",
    "we let @xmath30 be the midpoint of @xmath12 and we set @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "lexell gives the following formula for the area @xmath63 of @xmath137 : @xmath142    in his memoir @xcite , euler gives several formulae for the area in terms of side lengths . denoting the sides of the triangle by @xmath2",
    ", he gives the following formula : @xmath143 in @xcite , he gives the following formula : @xmath144 the paper is written in 1778 and euler says that he found the formula a long time before .",
    "he considers this as an outstanding theorem ( egregium theorema ) .",
    "euler gives two proofs of formula ( [ eq : area : euler ] ) .",
    "the first one uses analysis ( differential calculus ) and it is in the spirit of the methods of the calculus of variations .",
    "euler starts by taking a spherical triangle @xmath145 with base @xmath12 and varying the lengths of the sides @xmath146 and @xmath147 by an infinitesimal amounts , thus getting a new triangle @xmath148 ( see figure [ euler - variae1 ] )        whose sides are @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "he then investigates the area of this new triangle . denoting by @xmath97 the area of this triangle and @xmath105 and @xmath151 the angles @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively",
    ", he obtains the equation @xmath154 he then eliminates the angles @xmath105 and @xmath151 by using the trigonometric formulae , he gets a formula for @xmath155 which only involves side lengths .",
    "after several integrations , he gets formula ( [ eq : area : euler ] ) .",
    "the second proof by euler of the area formula ( [ eq : area : euler ] ) uses girard s theorem which we mentioned , that is , the formula which gives the area as the angular excess .",
    "in particular , combining the two proofs , we get a new proof of the theorem of girard .",
    "several other formulae for the area of a triangle in terms of the side lengths were obtained by euler .    denoting , as before ,",
    "the area by @xmath63 of a spherical triangle of sides @xmath2 , contained in a paper by lagrange which was published in 1800 ( @xcite , p. 340 ) :    @xmath156    in his _ trait de godsie _",
    "@xcite , puissant gives several expressions of the area of a spherical triangle , for example the following , which gives the value of the area in terms of two sides and the angle they contain ( p. 109 ) : @xmath157 and then ( p. 110 ) @xmath158",
    "these formulae have interesting applications .",
    "we already stated this problem in  [ s : quick ] .",
    "it asks for the construction of a triangle inscribed in a circle whose sides are contained in three lines that pass through three given points .",
    "the problem has several ramifications . in the same volume of the _ acta academiae scientarum imperialis petropolitinae _ in which euler s soultion appeared , another solution of the problem of pappus was given by his student fuss @xcite .",
    "several other major mathematicians worked on the same problem .",
    "chasles , in his _ aperu historique _",
    "@xcite p. 328 has a note on the history of this problem ( in the euclidean setting ) .",
    "we learn from him that in 1742 , cramer proposed the general problem ( in the euclidean case ) to castillon and the latter published a solution , in 1776 , in the berlin memoirs .",
    "the same volume contains a purely analytic solution by lagrange ( using trigonometric formulae ) .",
    "giordano di oltaiano and francisco malfatti solved the more general question for a polygon with an arbitrary number of sides that pass by an equal number of points .",
    "their works are published in volume iv of the _ memorie della societa italiana_. in the berlin memoirs of 1796 , lhuilier published a modified algebraic solution of the same general problem .",
    "carnot ( p. 383 of his _ gomtrie de position _ ) gave a modified form of lagrange s solution .",
    "he applied lagrange s solution to the case of an arbitrary polygon .",
    "brianchon , in the journal de lcole polytechnique , 10e cahier , published a solution in the case where a conic section replaces the circle , and where the three points are on a line .",
    "gergonne worked out a solution in the case where the circle is replaced by a general conic and where the three points are not necessarily aligned , and he allows only the straightedge ( and no compass ) for the solution ( _ annales de mathmatiques _ , tom . 1 ,",
    ", 1810 - 1811 ) .",
    "in fact , gergonne first considered the problem of circumscribing in a conic a triangle whose vertices are on three given lines , and he later on observed that using polarity theory for conics , one can transform the problem into the one of circumscribing in a conic a triangle whose vertices pass by three given points .",
    "gergonne considers this problem , together with other classical problems ( from pappus and others ) in the setting of analytic geometry .",
    "an analysis of his work in this matter is contained in @xcite p. 168ff .",

    "@xcite ( p. 235 ) that since the works of the ancients ( he mentions theodosius , menelaus and ptolemy ) ,  if the theory [ of spherical geometry ] , was extended and attained , in the hands of our most celebrated geometers , a high degree of perfection , it was always done by almost preserving the same framework , because the goal was always the same : the computation of triangles in order to fit the service of the astronomer and the navigator , and for the great geodesic operations which showed the true form of the earth . \"    in the year 1777 , euler wrote the three memoirs on maps from the sphere to the euclidean plane @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . .",
    "the three papers are motivated by the practical question of drawing geographical maps .",
    "we may recall at this point that euler , at the academy of sciences of saint petersburg , besides being a mathematician , also held the official charge of cartographer .",
    "we also recall that knowing the exact form of the earth was one of the major concerns of the eighteenth - century scientists , and there were long debates and controversies on this matter opposing the french and the english scientists .",
    "this also led to famous expeditions , to peru , lapland , kamchatka and elsewhere .",
    "it is also important to recall that scientists in europe were given by the great monarchs ( frederick ii , louis xiv and the russian tsars ) the task of finding methods in order to measure exactly the size of their kingdoms .",
    "several methods were developed for that purpose , and they used triangulations .",
    "the paper @xcite is the longest among the three .",
    "euler studies there systematically several maps from the sphere to the euclidean plane , having different desired properties .",
    "the method is through differential calculus , that is , he finds differential equations which the required maps satisfy .",
    "euler starts by showing a fact which he considers well - known , which is that there is no  perfect \" or ",
    "exact \" mapping from the sphere onto the plane . in modern words",
    ", euler shows that the sphere is not developable ( even locally ) onto the plane .",
    "having proved this fact , he writes :  since therefore a perfectly exact representation is excluded , we are obliged to admit representations which are not similar , so that the spherical figure differs in some manner from its image in the plane . \"",
    "euler studies the three sorts of maps :    1 .",
    "[ map1 ] maps where images of all meridians are normal to a given axis ( the  horizontal \" axis in the plane ) , while all parallels are sent parallel to it .",
    "[ map3 ] the maps which  preserves the properties of small figures \" , that is , that areconformal .",
    "[ map2 ] maps where surface area is represented at its true size .",
    "examples of maps satisfying property ( [ map1 ] ) are the famous mercator maritime charts , which euler mentions , and which are obtained by projecting the sphere onto a cylinder which is tangent to the equator .",
    "distances can be highly deformed by such maps ( at the poles , they become infinite ) , but there are certain practical advantages , and these maps are still used in sailing , because straight lines drawn on the map represent lines of constant slope on the globe .",
    "sailors are used to follow these paths , even if they are not geodesics .. ] euler writes that  the greatest advantage which this map gives to travelers at sea is that the loxodromic curves , which on the sphere cut each meridian at the same angle , are here represented by a straight line .",
    "such a straight line cuts all the meridians , which are parallel to each other , at the same angle [ ... ] but while loxodromoic curves are represented on the plane simply as straight lines , in contrast , great circles on the sphere are represented by transcendental curves of a very high level . \"",
    "euler concludes his paper with the following :  in these three hypotheses is contained everything ordinarily desired from geographic as well as hydrographic maps .",
    "the second hypothesis treated above even covers all possible representations .",
    "but on account of the great generality of the resulting formulae , it is not easy to elicit from them any methods of practical use . nor , indeed , was the intention of the present work to go into practical uses , especially since",
    ", with the usual projections , these matters have been explained in detail by others . \"    in his memoirs @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , schubert , another student of euler , examines the errors which one encounters when considering the terrestrial globe as a sphere .",
    "he also describes the corrections that have to be made if one considers the globe as a rotationally symmetric spheroid .",
    "the projections of the meridians become ellipses instead of circles ( as they are in the spherical case ) .",
    "lambert gives precise formulae for the axes of these spheroids and for their intersections with the meridian .",
    "he also studies the question of mapping conformally the spheroid , that is , in an angle - preserving way , onto a plane . in the memoir @xcite , he examines geographical maps obtained from maps between a sphere and the surface of a cone .",
    "mathematical questions related to the problem of drawing geographical maps were thoroughly studied by lambert , lagrange , gauss , beltrami , darboux , liouville , bonnet and others .",
    "lagrange wrote two memoirs on this subject @xcite extending works on lambert and euler .",
    "he considers ( cf .",
    "the introduction to his first memoir ) that lambert was the first to consider the theory of geographic maps in full generality .",
    "lambert , in his famous paper _ beitrge zum gebrauche der mathematik und deren anwendung _ ( contributions to the use of mathematics and its applications ) @xcite studied the question of characterizing the projections of the sphere onto the plane such that the angles between the images of the meridians and the parallels are preserved . the solution given by euler to that problem followes that of lambert . in 1816 , h. c. schumacher , a famous german - danish astronomer at copenhagen , who was a friend of gauss ( and who had been his student in gttingen ) , announced a prize , to be awarded by the royal society of copenhagen , for the question of obtaining a general conformal map between two surfaces .",
    "gauss won the prize , for a solution he submitted in 1822 , which was publised in 1923 in the _ astronomische nachrichten_. there exists an easily available french translation of this memoir of gauss @xcite .",
    "beltrami worked on such questions in the setting of the differential geometry of surfaces . in the introduction to his paper @xcite",
    ", he writes that a large part of the research done before him on such questions was concerned with conservation either of angles or of area .",
    "he adds that even though these two properties are regarded as the simplest and most important properties for geographic maps , there are other properties that one might want to preserve .",
    "he declares that since the projection maps that are used in this science are mainly concerned with the measurement of distances , one would like to exclude projection maps where the images of distance - minimizing curves are too remote from straight lines on the plane .",
    "he mentions in passing that the central projection of the sphere is the only map that transforms the sphere geodesics into euclidean straight lines .",
    "beltrami then says that beyond its applications to geographic map drawing , the solution of the problem may lead to  a new method of geodesic calculus , in which the questions concerning geodesic triangles on surfaces can all be reduced to simple questions of plane trigonometry . \"",
    "we mention briefly the memoir @xcite in which euler studies the existence of curves on the sphere that can be expressible by algebraic equations .",
    "there are two other papers on the same subject , @xcite and @xcite where the same kind of questions are studied on other surfaces , namely , the cone and the spheroid . in the paper @xcite",
    ", euler finds a family of rectifiable curves on a right cone whose ratio of side - length to the diameter of the base is rational . in the paper @xcite",
    ", he finds such a curve on the sphere , namely , the  spherical epicycloid \" , obtained by the motion of a great circle on a small circle whose diameter makes a rational ratio with the diameter of the sphere .",
    "the paper @xcite , on the spheroid , gives a simpler proof of the result of @xcite and it generalizes it to the case of curves on an arbitrary spheroid .",
    "this last section contains some information on euler s students and young collaborators , especially those who continued his work on spherical geometry .    at the two academies to which he belonged , euler never had an official teaching duty , and he only occasionally gave lessons , notably to princes and to princesses , in particular at the beginning of his stay at berlin ( cf .",
    "@xcite note ( f ) p.  48 ) .",
    "euler nevertheless had evident pedagogical abilities , as one can see by skimming in the books and treatises he wrote .",
    "he even wrote school textbooks .",
    "we refer the reader to chapter 1 of @xcite .",
    "we learn from fuss _ loge funbre _",
    "@xcite , that at the time of euler s death , there were , at the academy of saint petersburg , eight mathematicians who had benefited from his teaching , namely , his oldest son johann albrecht eulerleonhard euler had thirteen children , but only five of them attained adult age .",
    "johann albrecht ( 1734 - 1800 ) was his oldest son .",
    "he was an excellent scientist , although his career evolved in the shade of his father .",
    "he was elected , in 1754 , at the age of 20 , at the academy of sciences of berlin , of which his father was member . in 1765 ,",
    "when the euler family returned to russia , johann albrecht became member of the academy of sciences of saint petersburg , at the chair of physics .",

    "they learned from him , but they also assisted him in preparing his papers and translating his books into russian .",
    "for instance , inokhodtsov translated euler s _ elements of algebra _ , rumovsky translated his _ letters to a german princess _ , golovine translated his _ theorie complette de la construction et de la manuvre des vaisseaux_. krafft helped euler writing his three - volume _ dioptrica _ and fuss helped euler with the preparation of over two hundred and fifty works .",
    "we also mention that kotelnikov led a group that translated christian wolff s multi - volume _ anfangsgrnde aller mathematischen wissenschaften_.    concerning the number of euler s students , condorcet is more generous .",
    "he declares , in his _ loge _",
    "( @xcite , p. 308 ) :  all the famous mathematicians that exist today are his students : there is no one among them who has not been shaped by reading his books , or by receiving from him the formulae or the method he used , or who , in his discoveries , has not been guided by the spirit of euler . \" from condorcet , we also learn that  among the sixteen professors that were attached at that time to the academy of sciences of saint petersburg , eight were shaped by euler , and all of them , who were known from their works and who had received awards and academic titles , glorified in being euler s disciples . \"",
    "some details on the achievements of euler s students are contained in vucinich @xcite @xcite and in fellmann @xcite .",
    "five among these students  fuss , lexell , schubert , rumovsky and golovine  worked on spherical geometry , developing the ideas of their master .",
    "we already mentioned works of the first three .",
    "rumovsky became an astronomer and a mathematician , and he headed the saint petersburg geography department and astronomical observatory .",
    "golovine published in 1789 a book on _ plane and spherical geometry with algebraic proofs _ which remained during several years the main reference on the subject .",
    "rumovski became a renown astronomer and he was elected at the swedish academy of sciences .",
    "he is the author of very precise geographical tables of the russian empire .",
    "we also learn from fuss eulogy that euler liked to work with his students , and he invited them regularly at his home , to discuss various subjects around a dinner table . during the years 1752 - 1756 , while he was in berlin , two russian students followed him there , kotelnikov and rumovsky , and they were lodged at his house .",
    "paul heinrich fuss , writes in his _ correspondance _",
    "@xcite p. xliv .",
    " it seems that before the arrival of my father , which took place in may 1773 , euler was helped some times by one , and some times by another one of his numerous students which were among his colleagues . in a big in - folio which i keep cherishingly and which contains the first sketches of euler s memoirs which are prior to the mentioned epoch ,",
    "i think i can recognize above all the hand of krafft , as well as the ones of j .- a . euler and of lexell .",

    "[ ... ] every morning , a student showed up to read for him , either his vast correspondence ( and he was totally in charge of it ) , or of political sheets , or of some work which was worthy of interest ; they discussed several subjects of science , and the master , at this occasion , submitted with good grace to clarify things and to solve the difficulties of matters which the student had encountered during his studies .",
    "when the table was full of calculations  which was often the case  the master confided to his disciple his recent and fresh conceptions , and he showed him the course of his ideas and the general plan of the writing , leaving for him the development of the calculations ; and usually , the student would bring to him the following day the sketch of the memoir which was registered in the big book which we already mentioned ( _ adversaria mathematica _ ) .",
    "once this sketch was approved , the piece was written up neatly and was immediately presented to the academy . \"",

    "euler replied that among all the working geometers in the world , nobody else than himself or dalembert would have been capable of writing such a paper , and that lexell was unknown to both of them .",
    "after this , orlov sent immediately to lexell an invitation for an adjunct position at the academy , which lexell accepted promptly .",
    "lexell was appointed professor of astronomy at the academy of sciences of saint petersburg in 1771 .",
    "he became a close collaborator of euler , with which he started to work mainly on astronomy .",
    "he is known for his study of the motion of comets .",
    "the king of sweden offered him in 1775 a position of professor of mathematics at the university of bo , with a permission to stay three more years in saint petersburg .",
    "lexell accepted , and the permission was renewed two more times , each time for one year , until 1780 .",
    "he then returned to his hometown but he stayed there only one year , and he came back to saint petersburg in 1781 .    like fuss , lexell was present on the day of euler s death ; the three men were discussing the orbit of uranus which had been discovered two years before by william herschel ( 1738 - 1822 ) , and about other scientific matters , when euler had his brain attack .",
    "later , lexell became the first to compute the orbit of uranus , and his calculations showed that it was a planet rather than a comet , and from perturbations in its orbit , he conjectured the presence of another planet , namely , neptune , which was discovered subsequently .",
    "a comet that has been named after lexell is famous for having been the closest to earth in the recorded history .",
    "lexell worked on a topic which was called  polygonometry \" , a generalization of trigonometry where one studies relations between sides and angles of polygons .",
    "he obtained formulae for relations between angles and side lengths for quadrilaterals , pentagons , hexagons and heptagons .",

    "he did not follow this path , and he decided to study mathematics and astronomy without teachers and he eventually taught these subjects abroad , as a private teacher .",

    "<S> this is the spherical counterpart of a result in euclid s _ elements _ , but it is much more difficult to prove than its euclidean analogue . the second result , due to euler , is the spherical analogue of a generalization of a theorem of pappus ( proposition 117 of book vii of the _ collection _ ) on the construction of a triangle inscribed in a circle whose sides are contained in three lines that pass through three given points . </S>",
    "<S> both results have many ramifications , involving several mathematicians , and we mention some of these developments . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on three papers of euler on projections of the sphere on the euclidean plane that are related with the art of drawing geographical maps .    </S>",
