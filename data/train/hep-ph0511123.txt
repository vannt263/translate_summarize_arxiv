    "it is often argued @xcite that , from measurements of supersymmetry ( susy ) at the lhc and ilc , the model parameters can be extracted precisely enough to test the high - scale structure of the theory , in other words to test the boundary conditions of the soft susy breaking ( ssb ) terms .",
    "this requires relating , with very high precision , sparticle properties measured at the tev energy scale with the lagrange parameters at the high - energy scale , often the gut scale .    of course",
    ", the question arises as to what theoretical uncertainties are involved in this exercise .",
    "such uncertainties originate from truncating the perturbation series of ( a )  the running of the @xmath4 parameters between the electroweak ( ew ) and the high - energy scale , and ( b )  the relation at the ew scale between @xmath4 and on - shell susy parameters .",
    "they have been investigated in @xcite by comparing different state - of - the - art spectrum computations .",
    "differences at the level of a few per cent have been found , part of which have been traced to higher - order loop effects . since then",
    "important improvements have been made in all codes .",
    "when comparing today the latest versions of isajet  @xcite , softsusy  @xcite , spheno  @xcite and suspect  @xcite , the typical spread in the results is @xmath5 , which is compatible with the expected precisions at the lhc and getting close to those expected at the planned international linear collider ( ilc ) ( see @xcite for an online comparison ) .",
    "one exception is the mass of the lightest neutralino . on the one hand , @xmath6 is expected to be measured with per - mille precision at the ilc . on the other hand , in msugra with a bino - like lsp ,",
    "one finds differences of few per cent in the @xmath6 obtained from isajet7.72  as compared to @xmath6 obtained from softsusy2.0 , spheno2.2.3   or suspect2.3.4  ( these latter three programs typically agree to @xmath7 on @xmath6 ) . in this context",
    "it should also be noted that a @xmath8  gev error in the mass of the lsp can translate into a @xmath9 error in the prediction of its relic density @xcite .",
    "the public spectrum codes under consideration all have 2-loop renormalization group ( rg ) running implemented . a major difference between isajet  on the one side and softsusy , spheno  and",
    "suspect  on the other lies in the treatment of threshold effects for computing the sparticle pole masses .",
    "this is the topic of this paper .",
    "it was the above mentioned discrepancy in the prediction of the lsp mass that motivated this study .",
    "our analysis , however , applies to the computation of the pole masses of mixing sparticles in general .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 we briefly explain the two methods used to compute the sparticle pole masses . in sect .",
    "3 we review these methods for the example of the neutralino sector .",
    "we compare results of spheno2.2.3  and isajet7.72 , and discuss some shortcomings in the computations as well as ways of improving . in sect .",
    "4 we then analyse the scalar top sector .",
    "an improved scheme for the computation of sparticle masses in isajet   is presented in sect .",
    "the technical difficulties involved with a consistent multiscale approach are discussed in more detail in sect .  6 , and finally sect .",
    "7 contains our conclusions .",
    "the rg equations are employed in the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "the susy mass parameters obtained from the rg evolution are hence @xmath4 running ones . in order to obtain the physical sparticle masses",
    "one therefore has to perform the proper shifts to the on - shell scheme .",
    "the public susy spectrum codes can in fact be classified by their method of determining the sparticle pole masses .",
    "one approach , adopted by softsusy , spheno  and suspect , is to assume that the full set of mssm rges ( gauge and yukawa couplings plus soft terms ) are valid between the scales @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the gauge and yukawa coupling boundary conditions are stipulated at @xmath12 , while soft term boundary conditions are stipulated at @xmath13 .",
    "the rges are run iteratively between @xmath10 and @xmath11 until a convergent solution is found .",
    "the @xmath4 parameters are extracted at a common renormalization scale @xmath14 , usually taken to be @xmath15 or @xmath16 . the one - loop ( logarithmic and finite ) self - energy corrections @xcite",
    "are then added at that scale .",
    "parameter , also the two - loop corrections of @xcite are included . ]",
    "we will refer to this method as ` common scale approach ' .",
    "it is relatively straightforward and certainly self - consistent , but misses two - loop logarithmic contributions between the renormalization scale @xmath14 and the actual mass scale of the sparticle .",
    "such logarithmic corrections could be relevant in cases where the mass scales involved are severely split , such as in focus - point supersymmetry .",
    "the other method , proposed in @xcite , is to adopt a multiscale effective theory approach , and to functionally integrate out all heavy degrees of freedom at each particle threshold . as this is realized by the use of a theta function at each threshold , we call it the ` step - beta function approach ' ( implying continuous matching conditions for the remaining parameters )",
    ". the program isajet  does adopt a hybrid technique along these lines . in isajet7.72 ,",
    "the full two - loop mssm rges are employed between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the exception that one - loop step - beta functions are adopted for gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "( this approach means that log corrections to gauge and yukawa couplings at the scale @xmath12 are not needed , since they are handled by the rg evolution ) .",
    "in addition , each ssb parameter @xmath17 is extracted from the rges at an energy scale equal to @xmath18 , with the exception of parameters involved in the higgs potential , which are all extracted at the common scale @xmath15 .",
    "the rg evolution of mass parameters from high to low scales is equivalent to computing the logarithmic radiative corrections .",
    "the step - beta function approach hence gives a leading - log approximation of @xmath18 .",
    "for sparticles that do not mix , i.e.  gluinos as well as squarks and sleptons of the first and second generations , this approach directly gives the pole masses up to constant terms .",
    "for the required level of precision these constant terms are important , so they have to be added at the end of the running .",
    "the situation is more complicated for mixing sparticles , since multiple mass scales can be involved in the mixing matrices , and care has to be taken to compute the on - shell mass matrices in a consistent way .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the following sections , first for the example of the neutralino sector , and then for the case of scalar tops . moreover , as we will discuss in sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] , at the two - loop level , each time a sparticle is integrated out this implies non - trivial matching conditions for the parameters remaining in the effective theory . to our knowledge",
    "these matching conditions are not yet known and , thus , are not yet taken into account properly .",
    "there are also other complications , which we will discuss in sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] .",
    "at lowest order , the neutralino mass matrix in the basis @xmath19 is @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is diagonalized by a unitary mixing matrix @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 are the neutralino masses , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are their signs .",
    "the mass eigenstates are @xmath32 .",
    "the susy parameters taken out of the rg running are @xmath4 parameters at a certain scale @xmath14 .",
    "straightforward diagonalization of eq .   therefore gives the @xmath4 running mass eigenvalues . in order to obtain the neutralino pole masses , one has to add self - energy corrections @xmath33 leading to corrections in the masses , @xmath34 , and in the mixing matrix @xmath35 . here",
    "notice that the on - shell condition @xmath36 has to be fulfilled for each @xmath28 separately ; so one has to diagonalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : mntcorr ] ) four times is used . ] .",
    "the corrections at the one - loop level are given in @xcite ; see also the discussion in @xcite .",
    "they typically amount to a few per cent . since the shift from the @xmath4 to the on - shell sheme , eq .",
    ", can not be performed to all orders , there will always be a small residual scale dependence of the pole masses .",
    "this scale dependence is often regarded as an estimate of higher - order corrections . in the step - beta function approach ,",
    "the mass parameters that enter eq .",
    "are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "according to @xcite , this corresponds to the on - shell @xmath40 up to finite corrections .",
    "the on - shell mass matrix at the full one - loop level is then given by @xmath41 the complications involved in this procedure will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] .",
    "+      we first discuss results for the approach of running all susy - breaking parameters to a common renormalization scale @xmath14 and adding one - loop threshold corrections at this scale .",
    "as already mentioned , this is the method employed in softsusy , spheno  and suspect .",
    "we use the msugra benchmark point sps1a with @xmath42 as an illustrative numerical example .",
    "moreover , we take @xmath43 , and @xmath44  gev as sm input values in the @xmath45 scheme so as to be able to compare with isajet7.72 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath4 running ( tree - level ) neutralino masses and the one - loop corrected pole masses on the scale @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnt - spheno ] , for @xmath46  gev to 1  tev .",
    "in addition , table  [ tab : mnt - spheno ] lists the @xmath4 mass parameters together with the tree - level and one - loop corrected neutralino masses at sps1a for some particular choices of @xmath14 .",
    "the numbers have been obtained with spheno2.2.3 , which has the complete one - loop corrections of @xcite for all sparticle masses . as can be seen , going from the @xmath4 to",
    "the on - shell scheme is a quite important correction .",
    "the scale dependence of the @xmath4 ( or tree - level ) neutralino masses , @xmath47 , is about 5  gev between @xmath46  gev and @xmath48  tev .",
    "that is about 5% for the lsp mass and about 23% for the masses of the heavier neutralinos .",
    "for the one - loop corrected pole masses , @xmath49 , the scale dependence goes down to the level of a few per mille . here",
    "notice also that the scale dependence is largest for the wino - like @xmath50 .",
    "the results of softsusy2.0  and suspect2.3.4  are very similar to those of spheno2.2.3 . for illustration",
    "the results obtained with suspect2.3.4  are listed in table  [ tab : mnt - suspect ] . here",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath51 is slightly larger , because the self - energy corrections are applied in the approximation given in sect .  4.2 in @xcite .",
    "the scale dependence gives an estimate of the size of the missing higher - order logarithmic corrections .",
    "this is not necessarily the full theoretical uncertainty .",
    "one point of caution is , for instance , the fact the susy threshold corrections to the gauge and yukawa couplings are computed collectively at @xmath10 .",
    "this is a valid choice .",
    "however , the matching between sm and mssm couplings could also be done at , for instance , @xmath52 or @xmath53 . the thus induced uncertainty is not taken into account by the scale dependence as it results in a shift in the boundary conditions .",
    ".parameters and masses ( in gev ) for the msugra benchmark point sps1a obtained with spheno2.2.3  for different renormalization scales @xmath14 ; @xmath54  gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "integrating out all susy particles at a common scale is a reliable procedure if their masses are all in roughly the same ballpark .",
    "this is for example the case for the sps1a benchmark point .",
    "however , in the case where the susy spectrum [ including the higgs bosons ] is spread over a large range of masses , one should get more precise predictions by integrating out the susy particles at various scales .",
    "consider for instance the gluino mass . in the common scale approach",
    "@xmath55 while if the gluino is frozen out at its own mass scale , @xmath56 at sps1a with @xmath57  gev and @xmath58  gev , we find @xmath59  gev and @xmath60  gev , i.e.  excellent agreement between the two methods .",
    "if we move , however , @xmath61 to @xmath62  tev , we find @xmath63  gev , and @xmath64  gev  i.e.  a spread of 19 gev .",
    "a multiscale treatment of thresholds therefore seems desirable when the spectrum is considerably split .    in the following ,",
    "we outline the implications of a consistent multiscale approach . to work out a complete prescription",
    "is , however , beyond the scope of this letter . technically , at each scale a new effective theory ( eft ) has to be constructed , and one faces the following difficulties :      the naive way to take out particles from the rges via step functions ( as done e.g.  in @xcite ) and to use continuous matching conditions for the remaining parameters holds only for the lowest - order rges . at higher orders , finite shifts have to be introduced , as has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is gauge coupling unification in @xmath65 theories : at lowest order , i.e.  using one - loop rges , the boundary conditions at @xmath11 are given by @xmath66 . at next - to - leading and higher orders , finite threshold corrections due to particles with masses of order @xmath11 have to be taken into account @xcite , spoiling the lowest - order equality of the gauge couplings .",
    "another prominent example is the evolution of the strong coupling between the scale of the lightest quarks and @xmath67 : see e.g.  @xcite .    in our case",
    ", we are working with two - loop ( or higher loop ) rges for the susy parameters , as for the gauge and yukawa couplings . in this case , when integrating out susy particles at various scales , two issues have to be taken into account : + ( i ) the shifts of the @xmath4 parameters of the sparticle that is integrated out to its pole - mass parameters involve contributions of all particles , which are degrees of freedom of the current eft .",
    "+ ( ii ) the field(s ) that are integrated out also lead to finite shifts in the boundary conditions of the parameters which remain in the rges .",
    "take as an example the case where the gluino is the heaviest mssm particle . at @xmath68",
    "the gluino can be integrated out and the pole gluino mass @xmath69 is obtained by taking into account the shifts from all strongly interacting particles ( at the one - loop level ; at the two - loop level all particles contribute in principle ) .",
    "in addition , there will be finite shifts for @xmath70 , the yukawa couplings ( or equivalently the masses ) of the quarks , and the squark parameters .",
    "a similar effect has been known in qcd for a long time , where the decoupling of heavy quarks also leads to shifts for the boundary conditions of running masses of the lighter quarks @xcite .      by integrating out part of the spectrum it may happen that the symmetry of the eft is ` smaller ' than the symmetry of the underlying theory . in this case ,",
    "there arise additional parameters in the eft .",
    "moreover , there are in general higher - dimensional operators compatible with the reduced symmetry ; well known examples of this are the neutrino mass operator in the see - saw mechanism @xcite or the operators governing rare meson / baryon decays .    in the case of supersymmetric theories , there is a well studied and important example , namely the higgs sector . within the mssm",
    ", supersymmetry requires that three of the seven couplings of a general 2-higgs doublet model be zero and that the remaining four be expressed by gauge couplings ( at least at tree level ) .",
    "integrating out the susy particles does not only lead to finite shifts for the four non - zero couplings , but also introduces non - zero values for the couplings which are zero due to supersymmetry @xcite . in the very same sector , a further complication arises if the top quark is integrated out , as @xmath71 is broken in such a case .",
    "this leads to various new couplings to the @xmath72 and @xmath73 bosons , each governed by its own rge @xcite .",
    "a second important example in this context is the bottom yukawa coupling . if one integrates out , e.g.  the gluino , from the spectrum , one induces non - holomorphic yukawa couplings between the quark fields and the higgs fields , e.g.  a @xmath74 coupling @xcite .",
    "the complete set of superfield operators leading to dimension 5 and 6 operators in the lagrangian has been worked out for the mssm @xcite , assuming that it is the effective theory of a more fundamental one .",
    "if one regards the mssm as fundamental and integrates out part of it , the operators obtained will form a subset of those given in @xcite .",
    "the techniques to obtain the tree - level coefficients in front of these operators have been elaborated in @xcite .",
    "clearly , once from a set of mixing particles the heavier ones are integrated out , the question arises of how to obtain the mixing effects that are visible in the case of a one - step decoupling .",
    "the answer is that the above mentioned higher - dimensional operators introduce these effects .",
    "let us sketch this for the stops , for the case when @xmath75 . integrating out @xmath76 yields , for example , effective operators of the form @xmath77 after electroweak symmetry breaking , the operators of the first line contribute to the @xmath78 vertices , whereas those of the second line give contributions to the mass of the lighter stop .",
    "the coefficients @xmath79 contain the information of the evolution of the operators from the scale @xmath80 down to @xmath81 . as a check that these operators really mimic the effect of mixing ,",
    "let us calculate the stop mixing angle for this case , taking into account that the left stop mass is much larger than the @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( and thus the off - diagonal element ) : @xmath84 at the scale @xmath80 , @xmath85 , and thus if one naively replaces the higgs fields by @xmath86 and @xmath87 by @xmath88 one obtains exactly the coupling of the lighter stop to the neutral wino in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effopt_neut ] ) and the contribution of the left stop to the lighter stop mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effopt_mass ] ) .",
    "we note that the case of @xmath89 is also obtained if one applies the see - saw formula to the stop sector .",
    "we have discussed the two general methods of treating threshold effects in the computation of sparticle pole masses from high scale input : ( a )  renormalization at a common susy scale and ( b )  freezing out each sparticle at its own mass scale .",
    "we have focused in particular on the concrete implementations of these methods in spheno2.2.3  and isajet7.72and compared the results of these programs for the sps1a benchmark point .",
    "several shortcomings were pointed out , together with suggestions for improvements .",
    "the new version isajet7.73  incorporates these improvements , leading to better agreement between the various codes , especially for the lsp mass but also for the squark and gluino masses .",
    "integrating out all susy particles at a common scale , as done in softsusy , spheno  and suspect , is a reliable procedure if their masses are all in roughly the same ballpark .",
    "the results of the alternative method followed in isajet  are in good agreement with this procedure .",
    "( here , note that the method applied in isajet  is not a complete multiscale but a hybrid approach . ) in order to match the ultra - high accuracy expected at the ilc , a consistent multiscale treatment of susy threshold effects seems necessary .",
    "the method is in principle well known from qcd . at each scale where a threshold is passed , the relevant field(s )",
    "have to be taken out of the rges and a new effective theory has to be constructed below the threshold .",
    "the shifts of the @xmath4 to the pole - mass parameters of the sparticle that is integrated out involve contributions of all the particles that are degrees of freedom of the current eft .",
    "moreover , the field(s ) that are integrated out lead to finite shifts in the boundary conditions of the parameters which remain in the eft , so we face non - trivial matching conditions .",
    "additional complications arise when the symmetry of the eft is ` smaller ' than the symmetry of the underlying theory .",
    "we have outlined this multiscale approach in sect .  6 and discussed its technical implications",
    ". a complete prescription for the matching over multiple scales is , however , beyond the scope of this letter and will be explored in the future .",
