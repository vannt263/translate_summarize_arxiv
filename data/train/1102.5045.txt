    "quantum dots and single - molecule devices reveal many quantum phenomena of fundamental and perhaps practical interest.@xcite however , the role of a coulombic interaction between the charges on the dot and on the leads has been little studied , even though this coulomb interaction is clearly relevant .",
    "dot - lead interactions were studied by boulat and saleur@xcite , and boulat , saleur and schmitteckert@xcite in the context of an interacting resonant - level model .",
    "goldstein and collaborators presented general duality - based results that they noted were applicable also to models with dot - lead interactions.@xcite in previous papers we considered different aspects of quantum dots coulomb - coupled to leads , including the relaxational dynamics of a quantum dot side - coupled to a single luttinger liquid lead in equilibrium ( in ref .  ) and the case of a quantum dot coupled to two one - dimensional leads subject to a finite bias voltage ( in ref .  ) .",
    "however , in the theoretical work to date _",
    "inter_-lead couplings have not been considered . while inter - lead interactions may be negligible",
    "if the screening of the coulomb potential is strong , in general one expects molecular junctions to involve quantum dots which are very close to the leads , so that the inter - lead interaction is not negligible . in this paper",
    "we show that this interaction can be of crucial importance , because it suppresses fluctuations which act to decohere the different states .",
    "thus , electron - electron interactions can enhance transport , leading ( in appropriate circumstances which we define below ) to conductances which peak at the coulomb - blockade edge and thus exhibit a negative differential conductance .",
    "a lead may be modelled as a quantum wire described by luttinger liquid physics.@xcite however , for general geometries , inter - lead interactions do not fit easily into the luttinger liquid formalism , because the boundary breaks translational invariance and the interactions give rise to a complicated boundary condition on the charge modes .",
