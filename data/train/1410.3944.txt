    "<S> signal processing on graph is attracting more and more attentions . for a graph signal in the low - frequency subspace </S>",
    "<S> , the missing data associated with unsampled vertices can be reconstructed through the sampled data by exploiting the smoothness of the graph signal . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the concept of local set is introduced and two local - set - based iterative methods are proposed to reconstruct bandlimited graph signal from sampled data . in each iteration , </S>",
    "<S> one of the proposed methods reweights the sampled residuals for different vertices , while the other propagates the sampled residuals in their respective local sets . </S>",
    "<S> these algorithms are built on frame theory and the concept of local sets , based on which several frames and contraction operators are proposed . </S>",
    "<S> we then prove that the reconstruction methods converge to the original signal under certain conditions and demonstrate the new methods lead to a significantly faster convergence compared with the baseline method . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the correspondence between graph signal sampling and time - domain irregular sampling is analyzed comprehensively , which may be helpful to future works on graph signals . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations are conducted . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reconstruction methods in various sampling geometries , imprecise priori knowledge of cutoff frequency , and noisy scenarios .    </S>",
