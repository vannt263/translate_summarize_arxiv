    "the determination of the final spin of a bh binary is a question of key importance in astrophysics . modelling this in general",
    "is made difficult by the fact that it depends on the 7-dimensional space of parameters characterizing the two initial bhs .",
    "however , in special cases , when symmetries can be exploited , the description can be much simpler .",
    "several recent studies have shed light on the remnant of the merger process .",
    "using conservation principles , hughes and blandford  @xcite argued that mergers rarely lead to rapidly rotating objects . @xcite numerically evolved a sequence of non - spinning unequal - mass bhs , arriving at detailed estimates of the radiated energy and angular momentum . in a series of papers  @xcite",
    "we have studied the parameter space of mergers of equal - mass bh binaries whose spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the findings agree well with independent numerical evolutions  @xcite , as well as more recent studies of models with initial spins up to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "an important result of these studies has been the determination of simple ( quadratic ) fitting formulas for the recoil velocity and spin of the merger remnant as a function of the initial bh parameters  @xcite .",
    "a number of analytical approaches have been developed over the years to determine the final spin of a binary coalescence  @xcite .",
    "very recently , an interesting method , inspired by the dynamics of a test particle around a kerr bh , has been proposed for generic binaries  ( @xcite , bkl hereafter ) .",
    "the approach assumes that the angular momentum of the final bh is the sum of the individual spins and of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle on the last - stable orbit of a kerr bh with the same spin parameter as that of the final bh .    here , we combine the data obtained in recent simulations to provide a phenomenological but analytic estimate for the final spin in a binary bh system with arbitrary mass ratio and spin ratio , but in which the spins are constrained to be parallel to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "our numerical simulations have been carried out using the ccatie code  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the data presented in @xcite , we add three simulations of equal - mass , high - spin binaries and three simulations of unequal - mass , spinning binaries ( see table  [ tableone ] ) .",
    "other data is taken from unequal - mass , nonspinning binaries  @xcite , and of equal - mass , spinning binaries  @xcite ; all of the aei data is summarized in table  [ tableone ] . to avoid the possible contamination from the errors associated with high - spin binaries reported by  @xcite",
    ", we have not considered binaries with initial spin @xmath1 reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have , however , considered estimates of high - spin binaries ( _ cf . _ ,",
    "table  [ tableone ] ) , for which we know the spins remain essentially constant prior to merger , with changes less than @xmath2  @xcite , and that are very well captured by the fit .",
    "we start by considering the final spin @xmath3 as a function of the two free variables in the problem : the symmetric mass ratio @xmath4 and the spin of the initial bhs @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath6 .",
    "( note @xmath7 is dimensionless and not the angular momentum per unit mass . ) by construction @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we next express @xmath3 as a third - order polynomial of @xmath11 and @xmath7 @xmath12 expression  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is a lowest - order _ ansatz_. it intends to capture the behaviour of a function known exactly only in the extreme mass - ratio limit ( emrl ) and which has support from numerical simulations in two restricted regimes : _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a - priori there is no reason to believe expectation that @xmath15 is that the proposed fit will capture the general behaviour well , but in fact it does .",
    ".[tableone]initial parameters of the new binaries computed at the aei .",
    "the different columns contain the initial spin @xmath7 , the symmetric mass ratio @xmath11 , half of the initial separation @xmath16 , the dimensionless initial angular momentum @xmath17 , the numerical and fitted values for @xmath18 and the corresponding relative error . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     given the available numerical estimates , it is possible to calculate the coefficients @xmath19@xmath20 , and @xmath21@xmath22 by simply performing a two - dimensional ( 2d ) least - square fit of the data .",
    "this , however , would require a lot of care and is likely to lead to inaccurate estimates .",
    "this is because the space of parameters presently accessible to numerical simulations is rather small .",
    "reliable results are in fact available only for spins @xmath23 and mass ratios @xmath24 and thus corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "however , it is possible to exploit _ exact _ results which hold in the emrl , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath26 , to constrain the coefficients in expression  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the emrl results are not only exact , but also in regimes that numerical relativity simulations can not probe .",
    "more specifically , we can exploit that in the emrl the final spin can not be affected by the infinitesimally small bh . in practice , this amounts to requiring that @xmath27 which constrains four of the six coefficients @xmath28    additional but non - exact constraints can also be applied by exploiting the knowledge , near the emrl , of the functional dependence of @xmath3 on the mass ratio . a convenient way of doing this is suggested by bkl , and within this approach we perform a taylor expansion of @xmath3 for @xmath29 and determine that @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the coefficients in  ( [ eq:1 ] ) are then @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34/{45}$ ] .",
    "while this may seem a good idea , it leads to bad fits of the data .",
    "we believe this is due to two distinct reasons : _ ( i ) _ the lack of accurate numerical data for near - extreme bhs , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 , and which therefore leads to incorrect estimates of the coefficients ; _ ( ii ) _ expressions  ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) are analytic but not exact and should be used with caution .",
    "there are , in fact , deviations from analyticity in @xmath11 as @xmath36 , and as revealed by the presence of integer powers of @xmath37 during the transition between the last stable orbit and the plunge ( see  @xcite ) . in the case of non - spinning binaries ( @xmath38 ) , it is now possible to verify that the deviations are indeed very small  @xcite , but this check is not possible for very large spins . in view of this and to make the minimal number of assumptions , we retain the analytic estimate only for the coefficient @xmath39 , so that  ( [ eq:1 ] ) has five out of ten coefficients constrained analytically @xmath40 determining the remaining five coefficients from a least - square fit of the available data yields @xmath41 with surprisingly small residuals and large error - bars only for @xmath20 .",
    "the functional behaviour of expression  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and the position of the numerical data points are shown in fig .",
    "[ plotone ] .    in",
    "the following we discuss the properties of the proposed fit , providing evidence that it represents a very accurate description of the available estimates , and discuss how to use it to make astrophysically interesting predictions .    _",
    "( i ) _ the estimate for the final spin in the case of equal masses and the comparison with available data and estimates is made in fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the numerical estimates , [ circles for the aei data  @xcite and stars for the fau - jena data  @xcite ] , the bkl estimate and our 2d fit through  ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the residuals between the different estimates and the 2d fit ; these are always of a few percent only and become larger for the bkl estimate when @xmath42 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ despite the cubic dependence assumed in  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , expression  ( [ eq:4 ] ) is only _",
    "quadratic _ with @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath43 , it confirms what was obtained recently  @xcite , indicating that , for equal - mass binaries , the next order will be four .    _",
    "( iii ) _ using  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and  ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) we estimate that the minimum and maximum final spins for an equal - mass binary are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .    _",
    "( iv ) _ for nonspinning binaries , expression  ( [ eq:4 ] ) is cubic in @xmath11 and a comparison with the available data and the estimate from the eob approach combined with test - mass limit predictions for the ringdown  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ plotthree ] .",
    "in particular , the upper panel shows the numerical values , [ empty circles for the jena data  @xcite and stars for the goddard data  @xcite ] , a long - dashed line for the quadratic eob 1d fit  @xcite and a short - dashed line for our 2d fit .",
    "( because it is very similar to the eob estimate , we have not shown the bkl prediction . )",
    "the residuals in are shown in the lower panel .    _",
    "( v ) _ a physically useful condition that can be deduced from the 2d fit are the values of the initial spin and mass ratio that will lead to a final _ schwarzschild _ bh  @xcite . in practice",
    "this amounts to requiring @xmath46 in  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and this curve in the @xmath47 plane is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] .",
    "binaries on the curve produce schwarzschild bhs , while binaries above the curve start with a positive total angular momentum and end with a positive one ; binaries below the curve , on the other hand , start with a positive total angular momentum and end with a negative one , _",
    "i.e. _ , with a global _ flip_. also shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] is the prediction from bkl : @xmath48 .",
    "the two estimates are very similar for all values of @xmath11 and small differences appear for @xmath49 , where the bkl estimate is less accurate . shown with a cross is the binary @xmath50 ( _ cf .",
    "_ , table  [ tableone ] ) which yields a final bh with spin @xmath51 .",
    "the numerical value is between the bkl prediction and the 2d fit .    _",
    "( vi ) _ the bkl is expected to be particularly accurate for @xmath52 and its prediction in this regime are captured very well by the 2d fit ( of course the two predictions are identical for @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] with different curves referring to @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; interestingly , the differences are small even for @xmath55 .    _",
    "( vii ) _ it is simple to derive the value of @xmath7 which will produce a final bh with the _ same _ spin as the initial ones .",
    "this amounts to requiring that @xmath56 in  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and the resulting solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ plotfive ] ; clearly , the axis @xmath26 is a trivial solution and a magnification of the behaviour away from the emrl is shown in the inset .",
    "for equal - mass binaries the critical value is @xmath57 , in very good agreement with the bkl estimate @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the minuteness of the region for which @xmath59 ( dashed region ) suggests that bhs from aligned - spins binaries are typically spun - up by mergers .    _",
    "( viii ) _ it is easy to verify that by setting @xmath43 and @xmath60 in  ( [ eq:4 ] ) , the coefficients @xmath61@xmath20 and @xmath21@xmath22 coincide , within the error - bars , with the coefficients @xmath62 , @xmath50 and @xmath63 reported in  @xcite for equal - mass , unequal - spin binaries .",
    "the fact that the fit here is equivalent to , but has been independently derived from , the one for the equal - mass , unequal - spin binaries , is an indication of its robustness .",
    "indeed , it is possible to extend  ( [ eq:4 ] ) to the whole @xmath64 space  _ i.e. _ , to describe the final spin of generic aligned , unequal - spin , unequal - mass bh binaries , by replacing @xmath7 with @xmath65 .",
    "the resulting expression reduces to  ( [ eq:4 ] ) for unequal - mass , equal - spin binaries , and to the one in  @xcite for equal - mass , unequal - spin binaries .",
    "our suggested extension of  ( [ eq:4 ] ) to the @xmath64 space is the simplest one which recovers , for aligned spins , the well - tested limits of equal - mass , unequal - spins and unequal - mass , equal - spins .",
    "work is in progress to validate this ansatz with numerical simulations .",
    "0.25 cm    a final comment is one of caution .",
    "the dependence of the final spin on the mass ratio in the case of extreme aligned bhs is particularly challenging to calculate and not yet investigated accurately by numerical calculations .",
    "the predictions of expression  ( [ eq:4 ] ) in this limit amount to mere extrapolations and are therefore accurate to a few percent at most . as an example ,",
    "when @xmath66 , the fit  ( [ eq:4 ] ) is a non - monotonic function with maximum @xmath67 for @xmath68 ; this clearly is an artifact of the extrapolation .",
    "modelling the final spin in a generic binary bh merger is not trivial given the large space of parameters on which this quantity depends .",
    "we have shown that the results of recent simulations combined with basic but exact considerations derived from the emrl allow us to model this quantity with a simple analytic expression in the case of bh binaries having unequal masses and unequal spins which are aligned with the orbital angular momentum . when compared with all other estimates coming either from numerical calculations or from approximation techniques , the estimates of the 2d fit show differences which are of few percent at most .",

    "we are grateful to d. merritt for pointing out an error in the interpretation of our results .",
