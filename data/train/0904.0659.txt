    "the science of networks is indeed a new kind of science @xcite for its interdisciplinary character and its explosive development ; for some recent monographs we refer to @xcite .",
    "the list of applications of networks contains examples from physics , informatics , biology and social sciences .",
    "basic characteristics of networks are the degree distribution @xmath0 and the clustering coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the degree of a given node is the number of other nodes connected to that node ; the clustering coefficient measures the probability that two neighbours of a given node are connected to each other .",
    "as it was indicated only recently by mark newman @xcite , many real networks show a high clustering coefficient , usually some tens of percent . on the contrary to this",
    "fact , model random networks show rather low @xmath1 , unless a special procedure is applied to enhance it .",
    "examples of such procedures are described in @xcite ; we owe this list again to @xcite .",
    "the idea is to enhance @xmath1 gradually by linking nodes which are neighbours of the same node . when a node has three neighbours , it is convenient to replace it by a triangle @xcite ; the trick is similar to the star - triangle or star - delta transformation .",
    "the latter has been used also to construct apollonian networks with a high values of the clustering coefficient @xcite , and to prove some theorems in the theory of percolation @xcite .",
    "+ the transformation from a graph @xmath4 to its line graph @xmath5 @xcite used here can be seen as a simple reformulation of the star - triangle transformation .",
    "the latter converts a subgraph @xmath6 , i.e. a node with three neighbours , into a subgraph @xmath7 , where these three neighbours are linked to each other and the central node is deleted . in the transformation @xmath8 the same original subgraph @xmath6 is converted also into a graph of three nodes linked to each other .",
    "the idea of the line graph , known also as edge graph @xcite , is to convert all links into nodes @xcite . in this way",
    "a new network appears , where the number of nodes is equal to the number of links in the original network . in the new network ,",
    "two nodes are connected if they are formed from links which shared the same node .",
    "in particular , a node of degree @xmath9 is converted to a fully connected subgraph of @xmath9 nodes .",
    "the definition of distance ensures in particular , that the small world effect in the original network persists also in the transformed network .",
    "+ recently the line graph constructed from the scale - free network was discussed in @xcite analytically and numerically .",
    "the results for dense networks ( @xmath2=10 , 20 and 30 ) supported the rule that the transformed network is also scale - free .",
    "the exponent @xmath10 defined by the degree distribution @xmath11 of the transformed graph was shown to fulfil the relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 was the same exponent for the initial network .",
    "the line graph was also found to be useful in the problem of identification of communities in networks @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this work is to investigate the clustering coefficient @xmath1 in the line graphs transformed from random networks .",
    "our motivation is twofold .",
    "first , we share the point of view expressed by mark newman , as reported in our first paragraph .",
    "our former simulations @xcite can actually be seen as the same transformation limited to local subgraphs and to nodes of degree three .",
    "this technique allowed us to enhance the clustering coefficient in networks .",
    "second issue can be briefly expressed as follows . in social networks ,",
    "an active contact between two linked actors excludes at least to some extent the contact between each of these two actors and each of their other neigbours .",
    "if we introduce two states of a link , termed for example open and closed , then it is clear that there is an anticorrelation between links which share the same node ; two such links can not be open simultaneously .",
    "it can be convenient , then , to work on the network of links instead of the network of nodes .",
    "however , mathematical formulation of many problems is expressed in terms of networks of nodes .",
    "here is the area where the transformation can be useful .",
    "+ in the next section we describe some examples of the transformed networks .",
    "section 3 is devoted to our numerical results .",
    "short discussion closes the text .",
    "a chain of @xmath14 nodes is equivalent to a chain of @xmath14 links , then under action of the transformation @xmath8 it is converted into itself . in a fully connected graph of @xmath14 nodes each pair is connected ; there is @xmath15 links . after the transformation from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ,",
    "this is the number of nodes .",
    "the transformed graph is not fully connected ; this can be shown easily for @xmath16 . there",
    ", link @xmath17 is connected to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but not to @xmath20 , etc . for arbitrary @xmath14 ,",
    "each node has @xmath21 neighbours , then each link shares its each node with @xmath22 other links . in the transformed network ,",
    "each node has therefore @xmath23 neighbours .",
    "the number of links in the transformed network is then @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath16 in the original graph we have 12 links in the transformed graph - an octahedron , if links are equally long",
    ". +    similar arguments apply to a regular graph , where each node is of the same degree , say @xmath9 .",
    "each link joins two nodes with @xmath25 other neigbours . under the transformation @xmath8",
    ", each node is converted into a @xmath9-clique .",
    "obviously , each link in the original network joins two nodes ; then it contributes - as a node in the transformed network - to two cliques .",
    "its degree in the transformed network is then @xmath26 .",
    "the number of links in the transformed network is then @xmath27 . in the case of @xmath16 and @xmath28 again a tetrahedron is transformed into an octahedron .",
    "+ let us consider a network with the degree distribution @xmath0 , where is no correlation between degrees of neighboring nodes .",
    "the above arguments are now as follows .",
    "a link in the original network joins two nodes with degrees @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; the considered link is not counted . in the transformed network , this link is a node of degree @xmath31 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath32 in the transformed network is then @xcite    @xmath33    in the case when @xmath0 is the poisson distribution with @xmath34 the degree distribution @xmath32 for the transformed network is a new poisson distribution with @xmath35 . for the geometrical distribution @xmath36 we get",
    "@xmath37    this distribution , when presented as @xmath38 against @xmath9 , gives only logarithmic deviation from the degree distribution @xmath0 of the original network .",
    "for the power function @xmath39 we have no simple result .",
    "some analytical considerations in terms of polygamma functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ now we consider the clustering coefficient @xmath1 . in a fully connected graph of @xmath14 nodes each link @xmath17",
    "is converted under @xmath8 to a node of degree @xmath23 .",
    "maximal number of links between these @xmath40 neighbours is @xmath41 .",
    "the actual number of links within each clique of @xmath42",
    ". there is also @xmath22 links between nodes converted from links which met at the @xmath22 nodes different from nodes @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "then in total we have @xmath45 links , what gives    @xmath46    the same for each node . for regular graphs of degree",
    "each link is converted to a node of degree @xmath26 , with @xmath47 possible links between its neighbours . neglecting triangles built on the considered link",
    ", we have only @xmath48 links within cliques .",
    "then the clustering coefficient is    @xmath49    for a network with degree distribution @xmath0 we have to find an average    @xmath50    there , the contribution of pairs of nodes where @xmath51 is zero .",
    "the connectivity matrix for the transformed network is constructed here as follows . in the conectivity matrix @xmath52 of the original network",
    "each unit above the main diagonal means a link .",
    "we substitute these units by their consecutive numbers : @xmath53 1 , 2 and so on .",
    "let us call the obtained matrix @xmath54 .",
    "the last number @xmath55 is equal to the number of links in the original network ; it is then equal also to the size of the transformed network . in the conectivity matrix @xmath56 of this network , elements @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "are connected if their numbers @xmath57 and @xmath58 appear in the matrix @xmath59 in the same row or in the same column . +",
    "the original erds - rnyi network is generated from @xmath60 nodes .",
    "then , the number of nodes in the transformed network is about @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the density of links in the original network . with @xmath63 , as in fig . 1",
    ", we expect @xmath2 close to @xmath64 in the original network",
    ". the number of nodes in the transformed network should be about @xmath65 . in the example presented in fig .",
    "1 we have 50147 nodes .",
    "the result of the analytical calculation made above indicates that the mean degree of the transformed network should be equal to 20 , what confirms the simulation .",
    "+ the original exponential network is grown from a fully connected cluster of @xmath66 nodes .",
    "each next node is attached to randomly selected @xmath66 different nodes .",
    "no preference of attachment is applied for the exponential networks .",
    "the original network has @xmath60 nodes , and the transformed network has about @xmath67 nodes .",
    "the original network is known to have the exponential distribution of node degree ; @xmath68 plotted against @xmath9 is a straight line .",
    "the degree distributions of the transformed network , shown in fig .",
    "2 , seem also to be close to the exponential function , as in the original network .",
    "the curves shown are obtained from eq .",
    "the size of the transformed network is 29994 , 49985 and 79964 for @xmath693 , 5 and 8 , respectively . + to generate the scale - free networks numerically we have only to add the preferential attachment ;",
    "nodes are selected with the probability proportional to their degree.the original scale - free network is again @xmath70 nodes . in fig .",
    "3 we show the degree distributions for the growing parameter @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the plots are not far from straight lines in the log - log scale . on the contrary to the exponential network ,",
    "the slope of the obtained curves does not depend on the mean degree @xmath73 .",
    "the overall results agree with those of @xcite .",
    "4 we show the comparison of the data on the clustering coefficient @xmath1 , as calculated from direct numerical simulations ( points ) and from eq . 5 ( lines ) .",
    "it appears that the respective plots met when the mean degree @xmath2 is large enough .",
    "this accordance indicates that our model assumption on the lack of correlations works well for dense networks . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , the largest departure of the clustering coefficient @xmath1 calculated numerically from the analytical values are found for the exponential networks .",
    "this suggests that for these networks , the degree - degree correlations are the largest .",
    "the rule that a given degree distribution is transformed under @xmath8 into the degree distribution from the same family has some justification in the transformation itself .",
    "namely , a node of degree @xmath9 is transformed into a set of nodes of at least the same degree @xmath9 .",
    "this means in particular that hubs are transformed into cliques of hubs , and chains are transformed into chains . for the scale - free networks",
    ", our results on the degree distribution @xmath0 agree with those of @xcite .",
    "+ accordance of the results calculated numerically with the analytical formulas means in our case that the corrections introduced by degree - degree correlations @xcite are relatively irrelevant .",
    "we demonstrated that the transformation @xmath8 leads to clustered networks , where the clustering coefficient @xmath1 is not smaller than 0.5 .",
    "this limit value can be lower , if @xmath8 is applied to selected local subnetworks and not to the whole system .",
    "the density of the transformed nodes can be used to tune @xmath1 , similarly to @xcite .",
    "+ an application of the transformation @xmath8 to the communication networks needs now a specification of interaction between links , i.e. between nodes of the transformed network .",
    "the task is out of frames of this paper .",
    "we hope that the idea of interaction between links can find applications in networks , where a relation between two nodes excludes at least partially the relations between one of these nodes and its neighbours .",
    "we have in mind trade networks , sexual networks , decision trees and transport networks , where parallel links are activated along the principle this or this. links can also activate each other , according to this , then this. examples could be found in genetic networks , chains of catalytic reactions and social systems , where a process is simultaneously an active agent .",
