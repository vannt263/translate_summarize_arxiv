    "however , to our knowledge , the microscopic origin and physical properties of these states are not yet well addressed .",
    "given the similar magnetic structures of these incommensurate states to the multi-@xmath2 , they likely share the same origin : as the symmetry is lowered by the soc induced anisotropic interactions , the spin wave of the original commensurate magnetic ground state ( denoted as the parent state ) is distabilized , and the magnons condense at a nearby incommensurate wave vector .",
    "for example , in the kitaev - heisenberg model on the triangular lattice , once a finite kitaev exchange coupling is added to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg interaction , the nel afm ground state immediately becomes unstable to an incommensurate @xmath112 vortex crystal .",

    "states produced by the original lt method have single-@xmath2 structure , which means only @xmath114 is nonzero among all fourier components .",
    "one can easily check that , if the ordering wave vector @xmath2 is time reversal invariant(tri , which means @xmath115 ) momentum , such state always satisfy all local constraints and produces physical _ collinear _ groundstates ; if @xmath2 is non - tri , by taking @xmath116 in , we have @xmath117 , which implies that at least two component in @xmath69 must be nonzero .",
    "therefore , if the minimum of the eigenvalue of the tensor @xmath118 happens to be at least two - fold degenerate , lt method can still produce physical _ helical _ groundstates , otherwise such method can not produce physical groundstates satisfying",
    ".    in general , if a system has continuous @xmath55 symmetry , in some parameter regime the minimum of the eigenvalue of @xmath118 have degeneracy , so lt method still works .",
    "however , the model we study has only discrete symmetries , lt method immediately fails once the minimum of the eigenvalue of @xmath118 deviates @xmath67 .",
    "nevertheless , such multi-@xmath2 groundstates can still be well reconstructed in a modified version of lt method by introducing finite fourier components @xmath69 on multiple @xmath2 s based on the collinear states so as to minimize the energy on the premise of satisfying all local constraints .    for pure collinear state",
    "there is only one nonzero component @xmath119 where @xmath67 is the collinear ordering wave vector .",
    "if there exists some ( non - tri ) @xmath79 point where the eigenstate of @xmath120 is lower than the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath121 , the system may tend to partially condense at @xmath70 points in order to gain more energy . by taking *",
    "@xmath122 * in we find that we further need to introduce @xmath71 $ ] component in order to satisfy local constraint , i.e. @xmath123 .    from the above equation we can see that the magnitude of @xmath124 is about order of @xmath125 . in general , the eigenvalues of @xmath126 are much larger than the minimum ones of @xmath121 and @xmath120 , so @xmath127 is in principle very small in order not to cause too much energy penalty .",
    "following the same procedure , by taking * @xmath128 * in we find that other finite fourier components , say @xmath129 , in order to satisfy such constraint . in principle , following this way of construction , an infinite series of finite @xmath130 must be introduced in order to satisfy rigorously .",
    "however , their magnitude decays exponentially and for @xmath77 , these components are generally too small to be detected ( no greater than the order of @xmath131 ) and have no physical significance , so we truncate the series at @xmath78 .",
    "although the truncated configuration @xmath132 do not exactly satisfy , such an approximation turns out to be very well reconstructing multi-@xmath2 configurations .",
    "the groundstate is therefore obtained by minimizing    @xmath133    within constraints ( by taking @xmath41 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 in respectively )    @xmath137    we can see from and that @xmath138 and approximately @xmath139 ( as the magnitude of @xmath140 is generally much smaller than @xmath141 ) . by taking the energy optimization , we find that the energy minimum of multi-@xmath2 i / ii phases satisfy @xmath142 , i.e. all @xmath69 s are in the same plane .",
    "so multi-@xmath2 i / ii states are coplanar , with all spins lying in the plane spanned by @xmath141 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , such relation do not satisfy for multi-@xmath2 iii phases , which implies that multi-@xmath2 iii states are not coplanar .",
    "also , we find that the phase of @xmath86 , which is relavent to the spin configuration , do not effect the energy within our approximation .",
    "here we present our linear spin wave method which applies to systems with periodic structure in classical configuration .",
    "suppose the configuration can be devided into @xmath143 sublattices .",
    "this method apparently works for nel(3 sublattices ) and collinear(2 sublattices ) order . for multi-@xmath2 states",
    "one can still apply such method if we carefully choose the model parameters and the cluster size such that all ordering wavevectors well matches the reciprocal lattice of the cluster .",
    "the method is performed as following@xcite .",
    "suppose that ground state has classical configuration @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the unit vector pointing direction of the spin at the site @xmath146 labeled by magnetic unit cell index @xmath75 and sublattice index @xmath147 .",
