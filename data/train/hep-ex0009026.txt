    "semileptonic ( s.l . ) @xmath1 decays represent a favorable laboratory to study the dynamics of heavy quark decays , to determine the size of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ckm mixing matrix elements , crucial in the unitarity triangle test of the standard model , and to acquire informations on the structure of the @xmath1 meson itself .",

    "@xmath1 decays recorded at lep , at energies around the @xmath4 pole from 1990 to 1995 .",
    "this statistics is significantly lower than about 4  m s.l .",
    "decays recorded by cleo and 7.5  m already logged by the babar and belle experiments .",
    "however , the significant boost of the beauty hadrons , the confinement of their decay products in well separated jets and the production of almost all beauty hadron species make it possible to perform topological decay reconstruction with good efficiency on the lep data sets , thus exploiting analysis techniques complementary to those used at lower energy @xmath5 colliders .",
    "since operator product expansion ( ope ) predictions apply to sufficiently inclusive observables , it is advantageous to reconstruct s.l",
    ".  decays inclusively , with only mild cuts on the lepton and hadron energies .",
    "further , the lep kinematics allow the two extreme kinematical regions at small and large momentum transfer to be accessed , since the @xmath1 decay products gain enough energy from the @xmath1 boost .",
    "section  2 summarizes recent results on inclusive and exclusive s.l .   branching fractions obtained by the lep experiments .",
    "these results have been averaged and compared with those from experiments running at the @xmath0 .",

    "section  4 reviews some open questions in s.l .",
    "decays and model systematics presently limiting the precision in the interpretation of the data .",
    "the determination of the inclusive s.l .  branching fraction br(@xmath6 ) is important for the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "together with the measurement of the charm multiplicity and of exclusive decays discussed later in this section , they provide with a test of the s.l .  decay width .",
    "the main experimental issue here is the separation of the prompt @xmath7 signal from the cascade @xmath8 and the @xmath9 backgrounds .",
    "this has been usually achieved by performing a fit to the lepton @xmath10 and @xmath11 distributions to profit from the harder spectra of the prompt signal . however , this method is limited by the model dependence in the description of the prompt and cascade spectra , and alternative techniques have recently been exploited to improve the signal separation in a more model - independent way .",
    "these analyses use the charge correlation between the @xmath12 and the lepton , the decay topology , and double tagged events where both beauty hadrons decay semileptonically .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty remains , however , that due to the modeling of the @xmath7 and @xmath9 spectra .",
    "a global fit to the lep and sld electro - weak data , including also @xmath13 , @xmath14 and asymmetry determinations by analyses using leptons and other independent methods , constrains the s.l .",
    "decay models , thus reducing the related systematics by about 20%  @xcite .",
    "however , this depends on the relative size of the systematic uncertainties assigned to different asymmetry measurements , and a more conservative approach is to derive the lep average from the direct determinations .",
    "this gives br(@xmath6 ) = 0.1056 @xmath15 0.0011  ( stat ) @xmath15 0.0018  ( syst ) .",
    "after having rescaled this value by @xmath16 , to account for the different beauty hadron species produced , this result can be compared with the most recent determination at the @xmath0 , obtained by cleo using a lepton tagged method to separate the prompt lepton yield in @xmath1 decays from the backgrounds giving br(@xmath6 ) = 0.1049 @xmath15 0.0017  ( stat ) @xmath15 0.0043  ( syst )  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to analyze these results in relation with the average number of charm particles in @xmath1 decays , @xmath17 , since the semileptonic , double charmed and charmless yields are correlated once the total decay width is fixed .",
    "there are three main sources of data on @xmath17 .",
    "the results and their average are summarized in table  [ tab : nc ] .",

    "results are summarized in table  [ tab : dpisum ] .",
    "the @xmath21 production rate is less than that of @xmath19 : @xmath22 in disagreement with the hqet prediction in the infinitely heavy quark mass limit @xmath23  @xcite , thus implying large @xmath24 corrections  @xcite .",
    "including these corrections restores agreement with the data for @xmath25 , however the overall yield of the broad @xmath26 states is not expected to exceed that for @xmath19 .",
    "this apparent discrepancy with the preliminary delphi result can now be explained as an experimental effect , if the feed - through of non - resonant @xmath27 production  @xcite is non negligible .    a first estimate of the slope of the @xmath28 form factor has also been obtained at lep .",
    "delphi performed a fit to the reconstructed @xmath29 distribution and event rate for a sample of candidate @xmath30 decays obtaining @xmath31 = 1.55 @xmath15 0.60  ( stat ) @xmath15 0.55  ( syst )  @xcite , which is within the range of the current theoretical predictions .",
    "the value of the @xmath2 element can be extracted from the inclusive charmless s.l .  branching fraction br(@xmath32 ) by using the following relationship derived in the context of heavy quark expansion  @xcite : @xmath33    @xmath34    where the value @xmath35 = ( 4.58 @xmath15 0.06 )  gev / c@xmath36 has been assumed  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are small , due to the absence of @xmath37 term in the expansion and of @xmath38 dependence , and it is dominated by that on the @xmath12 mass . inserting the lep average br(@xmath32 ) , @xmath2 was determined to be : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 and hqe model systematics is slightly below 10% and the large uncertainties from the modeling of @xmath43 decays can be reduced in future by more precise data .",

    "the two measurements are consistent within their uncertainties , which are mostly uncorrelated .",
    "it is expected that the large model dependence of the exclusive method will be reduced by computing the hadronic form factor from lattice qcd .",

    ".  decays : i ) from the inclusive s.l .",
    "@xmath1 decay width , once the charmless contribution has been subtracted , and ii ) by the extrapolation of the rate for exclusive decays , as @xmath47 , at zero recoil .",
    "the two results can be used as a check of the underlying theory and to improve the @xmath3 accuracy by their averaging , the systematic uncertainties being partially uncorrelated .    for the inclusive method",
    "the relationship : @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    can be used to extract @xmath3  @xcite . by taking the inclusive and charmless s.l .",
    "branching fractions presented above and the average @xmath12  lifetime @xmath51 = 1.564 @xmath15 0.014  ps , the result is @xmath3 = ( 40.7 @xmath15 0.5  ( exp ) @xmath15 2.0  ( th ) ) @xmath46 .",
    "this inclusive method is limited by the lepton spectrum model systematics from the s.l .  branching ratio and by the theory systematics due to the values of @xmath35 and @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) and to the use of only the first terms of the operator product expansion as highlighted in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    in the exclusive method ,",
    "the quantity @xmath54 is determined from the differential decay rate extrapolated to zero recoil .",
    "the extraction of @xmath3 relies on heavy quark symmetry for the form factor normalization @xmath55 in the heavy quark limit and requires the computation of the finite @xmath12-quark mass effect and of non - perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "the value @xmath56 has been adopted by the lep working group  @xcite giving @xmath3 = ( 39.8 @xmath15 1.8  ( exp ) @xmath15 2.2  ( th ) ) @xmath46 .",
    "this result is in agreement with that obtained with the inclusive method .",
    "there has been a recent lattice determination of @xmath57 ; unquenched computations will provide smaller and better understood systematics .",
    "however the larger value obtained by the recent cleo analysis suggests a cautious attitude and the need for more experimental data .",
    "as more data on s.l .",
    "@xmath12 decays have become available and the analysis techniques improved , the determinations of basic parameters of @xmath12  decays , such as the @xmath2 and @xmath3 elements , are limited by theoretical uncertainties in their derivation from the experimental observables and by models in the description of the signal and backgrounds  @xcite . while this is promoting new phenomenological approaches , it also requires new measurements to better determine the input parameters and further constrain the models .",
    "this interplay between progresses in theory and new experimental insights addresses three main classes of questions : i ) the definition of a coherent method to include bound state effects in the description of inclusive decays , ii ) the accurate determination of the fundamental parameters , @xmath35 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( or @xmath53 ) , and iii ) the estimate of the effects of the missing terms in the ope and of violations of quark - hadron duality .",
    "the present experimental data and the theory predictions have already significantly progressed towards answers to these questions .    at present ,",
    "inclusive spectra are predicted by a variety of specialized models ranging from fully inclusive models , such as the accmm model  @xcite , to those saturating the inclusive decay width by the contribution of several exclusive final states , like the isgw and isgw-2 models  @xcite .",
    "while these models can describe the data quite precisely , after tuning of their parameters , their application _ tout court _ to different processes is often not justifiable . in inclusive models",
    ", the spectra are obtained from a free quark decaying into partons and the non - perturbative are corrections included by convoluting the parton spectra with a function encoding the kinematics of the @xmath12 and spectator @xmath60 quarks inside the heavy hadron  @xcite .",
    "the accmm model describes the @xmath1 hadron as consisting of the @xmath12 and spectator @xmath60 quarks , moving back - to - back in the @xmath1 rest frame , with a momentum @xmath10 distributed according to a gaussian distribution .",
    "the fermi motion width @xmath61 represents a free parameter in the model .",
    "the value of @xmath61 is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the @xmath12 quark in the hadron @xmath62 and can be derived from the shapes of inclusive observables ( see figure  [ fig : l3shape ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pffit ] summarizes the results from fits to the energy spectrum of the lepton in s.l .",
    "@xmath6 decays from lep and cleo data , showing a good consistency .",
    "the main issue here is to establish the validity of the accmm model , with these fitted values , to other decays , such as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this difficulty may be overcome by a description of the fermi motion in the framework of qcd .",
    "this introduces a shape function , @xmath65 , corresponding to the distribution of the light - cone residual momentum of the heavy quark inside the hadron  @xcite . at leading order and in the large @xmath35 limit",
    ", the light - cone residual momentum @xmath66 can be expressed as the difference between the @xmath12 quark mass and its effective mass @xmath67 inside the hadron : @xmath68 . however",
    ", the functional form of the function @xmath65 is not _ a priori _ known , except for its first three moments .",
    "the effect of different _ ansatz _ for the description of the fermi motion of the @xmath12  quark inside the heavy hadron has been studied in the case of @xmath32 both at the parton level  @xcite and for the physical observables after full detector simulation  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the fermi motion description contributes with an uncertainty on the branching fraction determination of @xmath15  5 - 15% , increasing as the hadronic mass @xmath69 cut to distinguish @xmath42 from @xmath43 transitions is lowered and depending also on the other selection criteria .    since @xmath35 enters at the fifth power in the expression of the decay width , @xmath70 , it is important to determine its value with an accuracy of better than @xmath15 100  mev/@xmath71 to guarantee a few percent error contribution in the extraction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 from inclusive decays .",
    "the dependence of the shape of inclusive spectra on the @xmath12  quark mass represents a further source of systematics from @xmath35 .",
    "recent estimates from @xmath72 spectroscopy , qcd sum rules and nnlo unquenched lattice computations have shown a remarkable agreement  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the results  @xcite , the lep working groups have adopted @xmath73 = ( 4.58 @xmath15 0.06 )  gev/@xmath71 , where @xmath74 is defined such as @xmath75 and the quoted uncertainty defines a 68% confidence region .",
    "the size of this error is still a topic of some controversy and its definition will have a significant impact on the accuracy of the determination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    these uncertainties could be reduced by extracting information on the shape function and the quark masses from the s.l .",
    "decay spectra themselves . due to its high statistics , the inclusive @xmath76 decay is the obvious candidate .",
    "since the shape function is expected to be universal in @xmath1 decays , these data could in turn be compared with that extracted from other decays and used to constrain models and parameters for inclusive , rare decays such as @xmath32 and @xmath64 .",
    "this analysis appears to be most advantageous for experiments at the @xmath77 since the small @xmath1 boost minimizes the finite resolution effects in converting from the lab frame to the @xmath1 rest frame . on the other hand",
    "the lower energy cut - off for lepton identification , at @xmath78 0.6  gev / c , introduces a model dependence when extrapolating to zero lepton energy .",
    "the first moments of the lepton energy and hadronic mass spectra can be used to determine @xmath79 and @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the cleo lepton energy spectrum limited to the region @xmath78 1.5  gev gave @xmath81 = ( 0.39 @xmath15 0.11 )  gev and @xmath53 = ( 0.19 @xmath15 0.10 )  gev@xmath82  @xcite .",
    "cleo reported the preliminary results from the first combined study of the first two moments of the hadronic mass and the lepton energy spectra  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic mass moments were found to be in good agreement with the previous result , while the lepton energy spectrum gave unlikely and incompatible values .",
    "however , the model dependence in the extrapolation to the full spectrum and the unknown contributions of higher order terms @xmath83 prevent the derivation of any conclusions from these disagreements and highlight the importance of further data .",
    "a first lepton energy spectrum for @xmath84 has been extracted by the delphi analysis after unfolding of the detector effects .",
    "the available statistics is still too small for a significant test that may become possible after combining with the data from the @xmath1  factories .",
    "the predictions for the inclusive analyses presented before and the extraction of the ckm matrix elements both rely on the basic assumption of duality , i.e. that the rates computed at the parton level correspond to those for the physical final states , after integrating enough hadronic channels .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been studied in a qcd model at the large @xmath85 and small velocity limit  @xcite and in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimension t  hooft model  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the sum over exclusive channels corresponds to the inclusive ope prediction to a very good accuracy soon after having integrated the first resonant states .",
    "it is interesting to comment here on the consistency of the determinations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with inclusive and exclusive methods discussed above .",
    "the agreement between the measured values is a test of the accuracy of the theoretical methods and also of the validity of the quark - hadron duality assumption , up to the combined measurement uncertainties , i.e. @xmath86 8% for @xmath43 and 25% for @xmath42 . with improved analyses and computational techniques and using the larger data sets , already becoming available to cleo iii , babar and belle , these tests may reach a sensitivity of @xmath87 within a few years .",
    "further tests of quark - hadron duality that have been proposed include the study of @xmath88 mixing and the determination of @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 separately by an analysis of @xmath93 and @xmath94 decays .",
    "focus  @xcite and cleo  @xcite have already presented new results on neutral @xmath95 decays with enhanced sensitivity .",
    "the @xmath91 meson may further contribute to the investigation of quark - hadron duality at a future @xmath5 linear collider able to deliver @xmath96 @xmath4 events , i.e. about 7  m s.l .",
