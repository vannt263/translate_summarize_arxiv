    "@xcite ) has become an indispensable tool in the description and understanding of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the observed particle output from heavy - ion collisions consists primarily of hadrons , whose momentum spectra and correlations contain information about the size and shape of the emission region when the particles last interacted with each other .",
    "this last scattering is commonly referred to as ( kinetic ) freeze - out , and the space - time locations of the last scatterings define a ( generically fuzzy ) `` surface of last scattering '' or ",
    "freeze - out surface \" .",
    "combined analyses of the observed particle momentum spectra and correlations yield not only geometric but also dynamical information about the fireball at freeze - out @xcite . because hbt interferometry yields both dynamical and geometric information , it provides a crucial window into the structure and evolution of the collision and its aftermath .",
    "azimuthally sensitive hbt ( ashbt ) analyses , where one studies the variation of the hbt correlator as a function of the emission direction perpendicular to the beam axis @xcite , are especially useful for probing anisotropies in the structure of the freeze - out surface .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that first and second order harmonic oscillations of the hbt radii are dominated by geometric deformations of the emitting source relative to the beam direction and reaction plane . traditionally , one performs the ashbt analysis as a function of the pair emission angle @xmath0 relative to the _ elliptic flow angle _ ( or second - order _ event plane angle _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath1 .",
    "dynamical models for the evolution of the fireball created in the collision allow to relate these observed geometric deformations in the final state to the initial conditions of the fireball .",
    "for such a program of constraining from final state spectra and femtoscopic correlations the initial state of the fireball and its subsequent evolution , a proper understanding of the ashbt formalism is of paramount importance .    recently the phenix collaboration @xcite performed the first experimental analysis of the azimuthal dependence of the hbt radii relative to the _ triangular _ flow plane @xmath2 .",
    "( for an earlier theoretical study see @xcite . ) triangular flow is dominated by event - by - event fluctuations in the initial transverse density profile @xcite and largely independent of the collision centrality @xcite .",
    "in contrast to elliptic flow , which is strongly correlated with the direction of the impact parameter @xcite , the direction @xmath2 of triangular flow ( the `` triangular flow plane '' ) is randomly distributed relative to the reaction plane @xcite . in two - pion correlations from central ( @xmath3 centrality ) au+au collisions at @xmath4gev , phenix @xcite saw clear third - order harmonic oscillations of the hbt radii relative to the triangular flow plane .",
    "the origin of these oscillations has not yet been understood . in this paper",
    ", we perform a model study to qualitatively explore several possible explanations of the observations in @xcite .",
    "we show how the data distinguish between these alternatives , thereby favoring one specific scenario .",
    "a more quantitative analysis , based on a realistic hydrodynamic model for the expanding fireball created in these au+au collsions , will be published separately .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we generalize the theoretical formalism of ashbt to higher order harmonic oscillations . in section  [ sec3 ]",

    "this is ultimately a consequence of the definition of the hbt radii in terms of linear and quadratic space - time moments of the source .",
    "they can directly probe geometric fireball deformations only up to second harmonic order .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath121 and @xmath122 are therefore insensitive to spatial harmonics of order @xmath120 in the source function . in particular , for a stationary ( non - expanding ) fireball , any spatial deformations of higher than second harmonic order ( e.g. any triangular geometric deformation of the source ) do not contribute to the oscillation amplitudes @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "only if the spatial deformation couples to a collective flow pattern ( which can be radially symmetric ) , thereby producing a momentum anisotropy of harmonic order @xmath123 , will we see azimuthal oscillations of the hbt radii with higher than second harmonic frequency .",
    "this implies that the measurement of a triangular oscillation of the hbt radii can not be automatically identified with the spatial triangularity at freeze - out .",
    "this is different from elliptic hbt oscillations : there it was shown that , for particles pairs with small pair momentum @xmath124 , geometric deformation effects dominate over anisotropic flow effects @xcite , and the following relation between the oscillation amplitude of the square of the sideward radius @xmath111 and final source ellipticity holds : @xmath125 @xcite . eqs .",

    "as already mentioned , we will focus on the correlator @xmath43 associated with the ensemble - averaged emission function @xmath55 . since triangular flow is driven by event - by - event fluctuations @xcite , to get a nonzero triangular spatial deformation of @xmath55 we must orient all events such that their triangular flow planes align before taking the average . as a result of this rotation , the ellipticities of the individual events will end up randomly oriented ( since the elliptic and triangular event planes are uncorrelated @xcite ) , and the ensemble - averaged source is expected to exhibit no net elliptic deformation , at any impact parameter .",

    "[ f9 ] , finally , we set @xmath214 and vary both parameters together from 0 to 0.25 . the emission angle @xmath0 is increased in steps of @xmath215 .    by following the emission contours around the circle , focussing on the @xmath0-dependence of their diameters in radial and tangential directions",
    ", one can qualitatively see the oscillations of the hbt radii in outward and sideward directions . obviously , the flow - dominated sources with @xmath216 generate the most complicated shapes for the homogeneity regions . for the sources with @xmath217 in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , the homogeneity regions are nearly elliptical for almost all parameter values and emission angles .",
    "using a simple triangularly deformed gaussian toy model for an expanding source with triangular flow anisotropy , we performed an exploratory study of the possible origins of the third - order harmonic oscillations of the hbt radius parameters as functions of the azimuthal emission angle around the beam axis that were recently discovered by the phenix collaboration in 200@xmath151gev au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "we developed a general double fourier expansion technique to study hbt oscillations of any harmonic order and applied the technique to our toy model for the case of triangular ( @xmath218 ) oscillations .",
    "we also pointed out that , since the oscillations are measured relative to the triangular flow which is generated by fluctuations in the initial colliding nucleon distribution around the smooth average woods - saxon density , one should in principle account for event - by - event fluctuations of the emitting source , and that the hbt radii of the ensemble - averaged emission function are not identical with those extracted from experiment by averaging the correlation function over pairs from a large ensemble of events . exploring this theme further",
    "will be left to a future study .",
    "here we focused on harmonic oscillations of the hbt radii from a smooth ( but deformed ) average source .",
    "we showed that , in contrast to second - order oscillations which , in certain limits , can measure the elliptic geometric deformation of the source , third - order oscillations in general provide no direct information about the triangular geometric shape of the emitting source .",
    "a spatial triangular deformation can cause third - order hbt oscillations only by coupling to radial transverse flow , and this complicates their interpretation because the hbt radii depend also on the amount of radial flow .",
    "perhaps more naturally , third - order hbt oscillations can be driven by triangular hydrodynamic flow .",
    "we showed that these two alternatives generate triangular flows of the emitted particles whose directions differ by @xmath194 , and that this causes a similar @xmath194 phase shift of the hbt radii oscillations when measured as functions of the emission angle relative to the triangular flow direction .",
    "the phase of the oscillations seen in the phenix experiment was shown to be consistent with a source whose flow anisotropy @xmath163 dominates over its spatial triangularity @xmath166 in its effect on azimuthal hbt variations .",
    "furthermore , we showed that in such a `` flow anisotropy dominated '' scenario the oscillation amplitude for the square of the sideward hbt radius @xmath111 flips sign at intermediate @xmath84 values of order 0.5gev , providing a natural explanation for the observed weakness of the sideward oscillations relative to those in outward direction .",
    "a systematic study of the @xmath84-dependence of the hbt oscillation amplitudes can help to substantiate this interpretation of the data and constrain the relative magnitude of the triangular spatial deformation @xmath166 and flow anisotropy @xmath163 .",
