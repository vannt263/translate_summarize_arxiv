    "we focus on the second - order susceptibility and the underlying molecular hyperpolarizability , which is the basis of electro - optic switches and frequency doublers .",

    "using equation [ limit ] , we can define the off - resonant intrinsic hyperpolarizability , @xmath4 , as the ratio of the actual hyperpolarizability ( measured or calculated ) , @xmath5 , to the fundamental limit , @xmath6 we note that since the dispersion of the fundamental limit of @xmath5 is also known , @xcite it is possible to calculate the intrinsic hyperpolarizability at any wavelength . in the present work ,",
    "we treat only the zero - frequency limit .",
    "until recently , the largest nonlinear susceptibilities of the best molecules fell short of the fundamental limit by a factor of @xmath7 , @xcite so the very best molecules had a value of @xmath8 .",
    "since a sum - over - states ( sos ) calculation of the hyperpolarizability@xcite using the analytical wavefunctions of the clipped harmonic oscillator yields a value @xmath9,@xcite the factor - of - thirty gap is not of a fundamental nature .",
    "indeed , recently , it was reported that a new molecule with asymmetric conjugation modulation has a measured value of @xmath10.@xcite    to investigate how one might make molecules with a larger intrinsic hyperpolarizability , zhou and coworkers used a numerical optimization process where a trial potential energy function is entered as an input , and the code iteratively deforms the potential energy function until the intrinsic hyperpolarizability , calculated from the resulting wavefunctions , converges to a local maximum.@xcite in this work , a hyperbolic tangent function was used as the starting potential due to the fact that it is both asymmetric yet relatively flat away from the origin .",
    "this calculation was one - dimensional and included only one electron , so electron correlation effects were ignored .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic hyperpolarizability was calculated using the new dipole - free sum - over - states expression@xcite and only 15 excited states were included .",
    "the resulting optimized potential energy function showed strong oscillations , which served to separate the spatial overlap between the energy eigenfunctions .",
    "this led zhou and coworkers to propose that modulated conjugation in the bridge between donor and acceptor ends of such molecules may be a new paradigm for making molecules with higher intrinsic hyperpolarizability.@xcite    based on this paradigm , prez moreno reported measurements of a class of chromophores with varying degree of modulated conjugation.@xcite the best measured intrinsic hyperpolarizability was @xmath10 , about 50% larger than the best previously - reported .",
    "given the modest degree of conjugation modulation for this molecule , this new paradigm shows promise for further improvements .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend zhou s calculations to a larger set of starting potentials . to circumvent truncation problems associated with sum - over - states calculations , we instead determine the hyperpolarizability using a finite difference technique .",
    "the optimization procedure is then applied to this non - perturbative hyperpolarizability .    to study the effects of geometry on the hyperpolarizability , kuzyk and watkins calculated the hyperpolarizability of various arrangements of point charges ,",
    "representing nuclei , in two - dimensions using a two - dimensional coulomb potential.@xcite in the present contribution , we apply our numerical optimization technique to determine the arrangement and charges of the nuclei in a planar molecule that maximize the intrinsic hyperpolarizability .",
    "in our previous work , we used a finite - state sos model of the hyperpolarizability that derives from perturbation theory ( we used both the standard orr and ward sos expression , @xmath11,@xcite and the newer dipole free expression , @xmath12@xcite ) .",
    "the use of a finite number of states in lieu of the full infinite sums can result in inaccuracies , so , in the present work , we use the non - perturbative approach , as follows .",
    "we begin by solving the 1-d schrodinger equation on the interval @xmath13 for the ground state wavefunction @xmath14 of an electron in a potential well defined by @xmath15 and in the presence of a static electric field , @xmath16 , that adds to the potential @xmath17 . from this",
    ", the off - resonant hyperpolarizability is calculated with numerical differentiation , i.e. using finite differences , yielding @xmath18 equation [ finite - diff - beta ] is evaluated using the standard second - order approximation to the second derivative : @xmath19 with several @xmath20 values @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,  .",
    "we then refine these values by richardson extrapolation @xcite and obtain our estimate from the two closest extrapolated values .",
    "our computational mesh consists of 200 quadratic finite elements with a total of 399 degrees of freedom .",
    "the potential energy function is a cubic spline with 40 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the numerical calculations in regions where the potential function is represented by 3 points in the spline are covered by 15 elements with a total of about 30 degrees of freedom .",
    "calculating @xmath4 from equations [ finite - diff - beta ] , [ intrinsic - beta ] and [ limit ] for a specific potential , we use an optimization algorithm that continuously varies the potential in a way that maximizes @xmath4 .",
    "we also compute the matrix@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnitude of the fundamental limit of the position matrix element @xmath26 for a one electron system , and is given by , @xmath27 each matrix element of @xmath28 , indexed by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is a measure of how well the @xmath31 sum rule is obeyed when truncated to @xmath1 states .",
    "if the sum rules are exactly obeyed , @xmath32 for all @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we note that if the sum rules are truncated to an n - state model , the sum rules indexed by a large value of @xmath29 or @xmath30 ( i.e. @xmath33 ) are disobeyed even when the position matrix elements and energies are exact .",
    "we have found that the values of @xmath34 are small for exact wavefunctions when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "so , when evaluating the @xmath37 matrix to test our calculations , we consider only the components @xmath38 .",
    "we observe that when using more than about 40 states in sos calculations of the hyperpolarizability only a marginal increase of accuracy results when the potential energy function is parameterized with 400 degrees of freedom .",
    "so , to ensure overkill , we use 80 states when calculating the @xmath37 matrix or the hyperpolarizability with an sos expression so that truncation errors are kept to a minimum .",
    "since the hyperpolarizability depends critically on the transition dipole moment from the ground state to the excited states , we use the value of @xmath39 as one important test of the accuracy of the calculated wavefunctions .",
    "additionally , we use the standard deviation of @xmath28 , @xmath40 which quantifies , on average , how well the sum rules are obeyed in aggregate , making @xmath41 a broader test of the accuracy of a large set of wavefunctions .",
    "our code is written in matlab .",
    "for each trial potential we use a quadratic finite element method @xcite to approximate the schrdinger eigenvalue problem and the implicitly restarted arnoldi method @xcite to compute the wave functions and energy levels . to optimize @xmath5 we use the nelder - mead simplex algorithm @xcite .",
    "as described in our previous work,@xcite we perform optimization , but this time using the exact intrinsic hyperpolarizability @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the fundamental limit of the hyperpolarizability , which is proportional to @xmath44 . to determine @xmath45",

    "first , we note that the potential energy function shows the same kinds of wiggles as in our original paper,@xcite though not of sufficient amplitude to localize the wavefunctions .    for the starting potentials we have investigated",
    ", our results fall into two broad classes . in the first , three common features are : ( 1 ) the best intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities are near @xmath49 ; ( 2 ) the best potentials have a series of wiggles ; and ( 3 ) the systems behave as a limited - state model . in the second class of starting potentials ,",
    "( 2 ) the wiggles are much less pronounced and ( 3 ) more states contribute evenly .",
    "figure [ fig : v=0-potential - wavefuncitons ] is an example of a class ii potential .",

    ", we calculate the lowest 80 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues , from which we calculate @xmath12 and @xmath11 . in most cases , we find that the three different formulas for @xmath5 converge to the same value when only the first 20 excited states are used ( using 80 states , the three are often the same to within at least 4 decimal places ) and @xmath51 , showing that the ground state sum rules are well obeyed .",

    "figure [ fig : vtanh40 ] shows an example of the optimized potential energy function when starting with the potential @xmath53 and optimizing the exact ( non - perturbative ) intrinsic hyperpolarizability . also shown",
    "are the eigenfunctions of the first 15 states computed with the optimized potential .",
    "first , we note that the potential energy function shows the same kinds of wiggles as in our original paper;@xcite and only 2 excited state wavefunctions and the ground state are localized in the first deep well - placing this system in class i.    the observation that such potentials lead to hyperpolarizabilities that are near the fundamental limit motivated zhou and coworkers to suggest that molecules with modulated conjugation may have enhanced intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities.@xcite a molecule with a modulated conjugations bridge between the donor and acceptor end was later shown to have record - high intrinsic hyperpolarizability.@xcite as such , this result warrants a more careful analysis .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare our present results characterized by figure [ fig : vtanh40 ] with our past work,@xcite particularly for the purpose of examining the impact of the approximations used in the previous work.@xcite figure [ fig : juefei0 ] shows the optimized potential and wavefunctions obtained by zhou and coworkers using a 15-state model and optimizing the dipole - free intrinsic hyperpolarizability . since only 15 states were used , the sos expression for @xmath5 did not fully converge ; making the result inaccurate as suggested by the fact that @xmath11 and @xmath12 did not agree .",
    "however , since the code focused on optimizing the dipole - free form of @xmath5 , and @xmath54 was small when @xmath4 was optimized , the dipole - free expression may have converged to a reasonably accurate value while the commonly - used sos expression was inaccurate .",
    "indeed , it was found that @xmath55 - in contrast to our more precise present calculations using the non - perturbative approach , which yields @xmath56 .",
    "so , the fact that our more precise calculations , which do not rely on a sum - over states expression , agree so well with the 15-state model suggests that in both cases , the limit for a one - dimensional single electron molecule is just over @xmath57 .",
    "this brute force calculation serves as a numerical illustration of the observation that the limiting value of @xmath5 is the same for an exact non - perturbation calculation and for a calculation that truncates the sos expression , which presumedly should lead to large inaccuracies.@xcite at minimum , this result supports the existence of fundamental limits of nonlinear susceptibilities that are in line with past calculations .     and first 15 wavefunctions after 7,000 iterations .",
    "starting potential is the @xmath58 potential .",
    "the final potential ( shown above ) we refer to as the zhou potential . ]    to state zhou s approach more precisely,@xcite the calculations optimized the very special case of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability for a 15 state model for a potential energy function that is parameterized with 20 spline points .",
    "as such , the potential energy function can at most develop about 20 wiggles . as a consequence , there are enough degrees of freedom in the potential energy function to force the 15 states to be spatially well separated .",
    "interestingly , after optimization , only two excited states overlap with ground state , allowing only these two states to have nonzero transition dipole moments with each other and the ground state  forcing the system into a three - level sos model for @xmath12 .",
    "this behavior is interesting in light of the three - level ansatz , which asserts that only three states determine the nonlinear response of a system when it is near the fundamental limits .",
    "it is interesting to compare the exact non - perturbation calculation , which does not depend on the excited state wavefunctions ( figure [ fig : vtanh40 ] ) and zhou s _ contrived _ system of 15 states ( figure [ fig : juefei0 ] ) .",
    "both cases have wiggles and the wavefunctions appear to be mostly non - overlapping .",
    "so , for the first 15 states , the wavefunctions appear similarly localized .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting when 80 states are included in calculating the hyperpolarizability for zhou s potential or when the exact non - perturbative approach is used .",
    "the first line in table [ tab : zhouv ] summarizes the results with zhou s potential and 80 states .",

    "@xmath59 is the hyperpolarizability of the starting potential using 80 states while the other ones are after optimization of @xmath60.[tab : zhouv ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , using the non - perturbative hyperpolarizability for optimization . ]    , using the non - perturbative hyperpolarizability for optimization .",
    "]    we may question whether small wiggles in the potential energy function lead to large amplitude wiggles as an artifact of our numerical optimization technique . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we used the trial potential energy function @xmath61 , where the wiggle amplitude is not large enough to cause the wavefunctions to localize at the minima .",
    "the optimized potential energy function retains an approximately linear from with only small fluctuation .",
    "in fact , the results are very similar to what we found for the linear starting potential and the wiggles do not affect the final result .",
    "the similarity between these cases can be seen in table [ tab : vsumary ] .",
    "next , we test a starting potential with large wiggles as shown in the upper portion of figure [ fig : x10sinx3000 ] .",
    "the lower energy eigenfunctions are found to be localized mostly in the first two wells . in fact , the lowest four energy eigenfunctions are well approximated by harmonic oscillator wavefunctions , which are centrosymmetric . as a result , the first excited state holds most of the oscillator strength and the value of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability is only 0.04 .    , using the non - perturbative hyperpolarizability for optimization.,title=\"fig : \" ] , using the non - perturbative hyperpolarizability for optimization.,title=\"fig : \" ]    after 3000 interactions , this class i potential energy function has high amplitude wiggles at a wavelength that is significantly shorter than the wavelength of the initial sine function ( bottom portion of figure [ fig : x10sinx3000 ] ) . in common with the optimized @xmath62 function ,",
    "the wiggles are of large but almost chaotically varying amplitude .",
    "this leads to wavefunctions that are spatially separated . while the wavefunctions are not as well separated as we find for the @xmath62 starting potential , the optimized potential yields only two dominant transition from the ground state ; so , this system is well approximated by a three - level model . as is apparent from table [ tab : vsumary ] , the ground state sum rule ( characterized by @xmath63 ) is better obeyed in this optimized potential than in any others .",
    "so , the wavefunctions are accurate and all of the values of @xmath5 have converged to the same value , suggesting that this calculation may be the most accurate of the set    our results bring up several interesting questions .",
    "first , all of our extensive numerical calculations , independent of the starting potential , yield an optimized intrinsic hyperpolarizability with an upper bound of 0.71 , which is about thirty percent lower than what the sum rules allow . since numerical optimization can settle in to a local maximum",
    ", it is possible that all of the starting potentials are far from the global maximum of @xmath64 . indeed , since most potentials lead to systems that require more than three dominant states to express the hyperpolarizability , this may in itself be an indicator that we are not at the fundamental limit precisely because these systems have more than three states .",
    "indeed , the original results of zhou and coworkers frames the problem in a way ( i.e. a 15-level model in a potential limited to about 20 wiggles ) that allows a solution to the optimization problem to lead to three dominant states .",
    "so , while it may be argued that this system is contrived and unphysical , we have found value in trying such toy models when testing various hypotheses . this toy model    * leads to a three - level system as the three - level ansatz proposes * has the same qualitative properties as more precise methods * has given insights into making new molecules with record - breaking intrinsic hyperpolarizability    given the complexity of calculating nonlinear - susceptibilities , our semi - quantitative method may be a good way of generating new ideas .",
    "the three - level ansatz proposes that at the fundamental limit , all transitions are negligible except between three dominant states .",
    "there appears to be no proof of the ansatz aside from the fact that it leads to an accurate prediction of the upper bound of nonlinear susceptibilities , both calculated and measured . to understand the motivation behind the ansatz",
    ", it is useful to understand how the two - level model optimizes the polarizability , @xmath65 , without the need to rely on any assumptions .",
    "this is trivial to show by using the fact that the polarizability depends only on the positive - definite transition moments , @xmath66 , the same parameters that are found in the ground state sum rules.@xcite    for nonlinear susceptibilities , the situation is much more complicated because the sos expression depends on quantities such as @xmath67 , where these terms can be both positive and negative .",
    "furthermore , the sum rules that relate excited states moments to each other allow for these moments to be much larger than transition moments to the ground state .",
    "so , it would seem plausible that one could design a system with many excited states in a way that all of the transition moments between excited states would add constructively to yield a larger hyperpolarizability than what we calculate with the three - level ansatz .",
    "none of our numerical calculations , independent of the potential energy function , yield a value greater than 0.71 . since our potential energy functions are general 1-dimensional potentials ( i.e. the potentials are not limited to coulomb potentials , nor are the wavefunctions approximated as is common in standard quantum chemical computations ) , our calculations most likely span a broader range of possible wavefunctions leading to a larger variety of states that contribute to the hyperpolarizability .    however , there appear to be local maxima associated with systems that behave as a three - level system and others with many states , and , the maximum values both are 0.71 .",
    "it is interesting that so may different sets of transition moments and energies can yield the exact same local maximum . to gain a deeper appreciation of the underlying physics ,",
    "let s consider the transition moments and energies in the sum - over - states expression for the hyperpolarizability as adjustable parameters .",
    "for a system with @xmath1 states , there are @xmath68 energy parameters of the form @xmath69 .",
    "the moment matrix @xmath70 has @xmath71 components .",
    "if the matrix is real , there are @xmath72 unique off - diagonal terms and @xmath1 diagonal dipole moments .",
    "since all dipole moments appear as differences of the form @xmath73 , there are only @xmath68 dipole moment parameters .",
    "therefore , the dipole matrix is characterized by @xmath74 parameters .",
    "combining the energy and dipole matrix parameters , there are a total of @xmath75 parameters .",
    "the n - state sum rules are of the form : @xmath76 so the sum rules comprise a total of @xmath71 equations ( i.e. an equation for each @xmath31 ) . if the sum rules are truncated to @xmath1 states , the sum rule indexed by @xmath77 is nonsensical because it contradicts the other sum rules . furthermore , if the transition moments are real , then @xmath78 , so only @xmath79 of the equations are independent . as such",
    ", there are a total of @xmath80 independent equations .",
    "since the sos expression for the nonlinear - susceptibility has @xmath75 parameters and the sum rules provide @xmath81 equations , the sos expression can be reduced to a form with @xmath68 parameters . for example , the three - level model for the hyperpolarizability , which is expressed in terms of 7 parameters , can be reduced to two parameters using 5 sum rule equations . in practice , however , even fewer sum rule equations are usually available because some of them lead to physically unreasonable consequences .",
    "while the @xmath82 sum rule is clearly unphysical due to truncation , sum rule equations that are near equation @xmath82 may also be unphysical . in the case of the three - level model",
    ", it is found that the equation @xmath83 allows for an infinite hyperpolarizability , so that equation is ignored on the grounds that it violates the principle of physical soundness.@xcite this leads to a hyperpolarizability in terms of 3 variables , which are chosen to be @xmath2 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . the expression is then maximized with respect to the two parameters @xmath16 and @xmath86 , leaving the final result a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that the sos expression for the hyperpolarizability can be expressed in terms of at least @xmath68 parameters ; so , it would appear that as more levels are included in the sos expression , there are more free parameters that can be varied without violating the sum rules . as @xmath87",
    ", there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters .",
    "so , it is indeed puzzling that the three - level ansatz yields a fundamental limit that is consistent with all of our calculations for a wide range of potentials , many of which have many excited states .",
    "it may be that we are only considering a small subset of potential energy functions ; or , perhaps the expression for the hyperpolarizability depends on the parameters in such a way that large matrix elements contribute to the hyperpolarizability with alternating signs so that the big terms cancel .",
    "this is a puzzle that needs to be solved if we are to understand what makes @xmath5 large .    to investigate",
    "whether the limiting behavior is due to our use of 1-dimensional potentials , we have also optimized the intrinsic hyperpolarizability in two - dimensions . in this case",
    ", we focus on the largest tensor component , @xmath88 and describe the potential as a superposition of point charges .",
    "as described in the literature,@xcite we solve the two - dimensional schrdinger eigenvalue problem , @xmath89 for the lowest ten to 25 energy eigenstates , depending on the degree of convergence of the resulting intrinsic hyperpolarizability .",
    "we use the two - dimensional logarithmic coulomb potential , which for @xmath90 nuclei with charges @xmath91 ,  , @xmath92 located at points @xmath93 ,  , @xmath94 , is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a characteristic length . with @xmath97 , the force due to a charge at distance",

    "the two - dimensional analysis illustrates that numerical optimization correctly identifies the local maxima ( peaks and valleys ) and that the magnitude of maximum intrinsic hyperpolarizability ( 0.65 vs 0.68 ) is close to the maximum we get for the one - dimensional optimization of the potential energy function ( 0.71 ) .",
    "all computations we have tried , including varying the potential energy function in one dimension or moving around point charges in a plane all yield an intrinsic hyperpolarizability that is less than @xmath137 .",

    "several of the common proposed explanations , such as vibronic dilution , have been eliminated.@xcite perhaps it is not possible to make large - enough variations of the potential energy function without making the molecule unstable . or , perhaps there are subtle issues with electron correlation , which prevents electrons from responding to light with their full potential .",
