    "green s functions and correlation functions in quantum field theory(qft ) , statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics are closely related to experimental studies on macroscopic matter systems and elementary particles @xcite .",
    "because of the existence of an operator - product - expansion algebra , various multi - point green s or correlation functions with the points approaching each other can be reduced down to one - point functions or vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of local fields @xcite . on the other hand , as far as vevs themselves go , they determine the linear responses of statistical - mechanics systems to external fields , and contain non - perturbative information about qft , which is not accessible through a direct investigation in the conformal perturbation theory . hence the problem of calculating the vevs of local fields is of fundamental significance .",
    "there exist some methods for calculating the vevs of local fields . for an integrable qft which can be considered as a conformal field theory perturbed by some operator",
    ", the vev of the perturbing operator can be exactly obtained with the help of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz approach @xcite .",
    "this kind of exact calculation succeeded only in very few cases @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , s. lukyanov and a. zamolodchikov made a significant progress in 1997 and conjectured the exact vev of an exponential field in the two - dimensional sine - gordon ( sg ) and sinh - gordon ( shg ) field theories @xcite .",
    "this progress has led to the use of reflection relation @xcite and accordingly exact vevs of local fields in many perturbed conformal field theories without and with boundaries have been proposed @xcite through solving the reflection relations .",
    "furthermore , these conjectured exact vevs have again been employed to give vevs of local fields in some other qfts by making use of quantum group restriction existed between the relevant qfts @xcite . besides , recently , because of the peculiarity in super - liouville theories with boundary , conformal bootstrap method @xcite and modular transformation method @xcite were used to derive one - point functions of bulk and boundary operators . for the boundary scaling lee - yang model , one - point functions of bulk and boundary fields",
    "were approximated by using the truncated conformal space approach and the form - factor expansion @xcite .",
    "additionally , in order to check those exact predictions , perturbation theory @xcite and some numerical methods based on the truncated conformal space approach @xcite were adopted to calculate the vevs .    obviously , since vevs of local fields in qft are non - perturbative objects , general and systematical non - perturbation methods of directly calculating vevs are needed and such tools are also necessary for independently checking those predictions on the exact vevs .",
    "we feel that a variational perturbation ( vp ) theory @xcite can afford such a tool . the vp theory can be regarded as some mixture of conventional perturbation theory and variational method .",
    "as is well known , the perturbation theory is a systematical approximation tool and results from it can be improved order by order .",
    "meanwhile , the variational method is feasible and effective as well as valid for any coupling ( the weak or the strong ) .",
    "these two methods have been dominating approximation calculations in theoretical researches for a long time , being two standard approximation tools .",
    "however , the perturbation theory is valid only for very weak coupling at most and the variational method gives no indication of the error in its resultant value . in order to collect their merits ,",
    "avoid their drawbacks , and , of course , to develop a systematical non - perturbative tool , a primitive idea of the vp theory for simply combining the conventional perturbation theory with the variational method was proposed as a tool of solving stationary schrdinger equation in 1955 @xcite ( which can even date back to even twenty more years earlier @xcite ) .",
    "this naive combination has been applied to many fields in physics ( see references in ref .",
    "it amounts to an expansion around variational approximate result and the variational parameter in the expansion is determined with the one - order result by variational method .",
    "this primitive vp theory really produces non - perturbative results which are valid for any coupling strength and can be improved order by order .",
    "nevertheless , the naive combination of the perturbative and variational methods does not provide a convergent tool because the variational parameter is independent of the approximate order @xcite . in 1981 or so ,",
    "the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite was proposed by p. m. steveson ( possibly , earlier in the middle 1970s , a similar principle was proposed in mosc .",

    "31 * , 10(1976 ) by v. i. yukalov ) and can be used to determine an auxiliary parameter ( the aforementioned variational parameter ) which is artificially introduced into the vp theory .",
    "the vp theory with the pms determines the parameter order by order ( see next section ) and is believed to be a fast convergent theory @xcite .",
    "now , as a systematical and non - perturbative tool , it has developed with many equivalent practical schemes to calculate energies , free energies and effective potentials of systems , and has been applied to qft , condensed matter physics , statistical mechanics , chemical physics , and so on @xcite ( for a full list , to see references in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we intend to develop a vp scheme to calculate the vevs of local fields in qft .    in sect.ii , we will develop the vp scheme in a general way . for universality and definiteness",
    ", we shall consider a class of systems , scalar field systems or fermi field systems which can be bosonized , with the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath1 in eq.(1 ) , the subscript @xmath2 represents the coordinates in a @xmath3-dimensional minkowski space , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding covariant derivatives , and @xmath6 the scalar field at @xmath7 .",
    "the potential @xmath8 in eq.(1 ) is assumed to have a fourier representation in a sense of tempered distributions @xcite , @xmath9 speaking roughly , this requires that the integral @xmath10 with a positive constant @xmath11 is finite .",
    "this should nt be regarded as a limitation , and , as a matter of fact , quite a number of model potentials possess the property , such as the potentials of polynomial models , sg and shg models , bullough - dodd model , liouville model , two models discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and so on . by the way",
    ", a similar general model was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . for comparisons with existed work",
    ", we will work in a @xmath12-dimensional euclidean space with @xmath13 . through the time continuation @xmath14 with @xmath15 the euclidean time",
    ", a point @xmath7 in the minkowski space is transformed into a point @xmath16 in the euclidean space . for universality and definiteness",
    "again , we will also assume that the local field has a fourier representation , @xmath17 at least in a sense of tempered distributions .",
    "here , @xmath18 is a given point in the euclidean space .",
    "it is evident that such a local field is a comparatively general one .",
    "in the present paper , based on the vp scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the scheme stemmed from the okopinska s optimized expansion @xcite , and was proposed by stancu and stevenson @xcite ) , we will develop a vp scheme to calculate the vev of the local field @xmath19 , eq.(3 ) , for the field theory eq.(1 ) in the @xmath12-dimensional euclidean space . in subsection @xmath20 of next section",
    ", we will state the vp scheme .",
    "it embraces mainly two key steps : one is the vp expansion on the vevs with an auxiliary parameter introduced , and another is the determination of the auxiliary parameter in the expressions truncated from the vp expansion series",
    ". it is the truncated expressions that give rise to the vp approximate results of vevs up to the truncated order .",
    "then , in subsection @xmath21 of next section , the truncated expansions of the vev of @xmath22 in the field theory , eq.(1 ) , will concretely be derived up to the second order .",
    "one will see that the resultant truncated expressions up to the second order are composed mainly of gaussian transforms of the local field @xmath23 and the potential @xmath24 as well as their derivatives , and we will call them gaussian smearing formulae . for ,",
    "at least , any scalar field theory which is involved in the model with eq.(1 ) , one can give vp approximated vevs of @xmath22 up to the second order just by finishing ordinary integrations appeared in the gaussian smearing formulae instead of calculating path integrals in the definitions of the vevs .",
    "this point is the main reason why we are interested in the general model , eq.(1 ) and the general local fields , eq.(3 ) .",
    "we should point out that since the qft with eq.(1 ) is not a concrete theory , so we will not carry out the other key step to determine the adjustable parameter in the gaussian smearing formulae .",
    "section iv will provide such an example on how to determine the auxiliary parameter by the pms .    about the vp scheme ,",
    "the renormalization problem need to be explained here .",
    "since a bare field theory is full of divergences and makes no senses , we have to face those divergences appeared in the gaussian smearing formulae and perform a necessary renormalization procedure to make the formulae finite before performing the second key step with the pms in the vp scheme .",
    "generally , the renormalization procedure is usually very complicated , and is similar to those in perturbative theory @xcite . in order to concentrate our attention at developing the vp theory ,",
    "we do not hope to be plagued with the complicated renormalization problems of qft , but we certainly hope to give a finite example for the gaussian smearing formulae .",
    "fortunately , for any two - dimensional scalar field theory with non - derivative interactions , all ultraviolet divergences can be removed by normal - ordering the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this fact led to a simple renormalization scheme for two - dimensional field theory , the coleman s normal - ordering renormalization prescription .",
    "furthermore , this convenient renormalization prescription has been generalized to path integrals of minkowski and euclidean formalisms in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ( 2002 ) , respectively .",
    "hence , this prescription was used in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be adopted in the present paper .",
    "one will see that the gaussian smearing formulae are full of no explicit divergences for the case of @xmath25 and so , generally , no further renormalization procedures are needed for this case .    as an application of the scheme",
    ", sections iii and iv will calculate the vev of the local exponential field @xmath26 in the sg field theory , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 a parameter .",
    "the sg model , which appeared early in 1909 @xcite , is closely related to lots of problems in mathematics and physics , and has been extensively studied . for the general local field @xmath29 , eq.(3 )",
    ", its vev can closely be related to that of an local exponential field , and so the problem of calculating the vevs of the local exponential field is important . in 1997 , through direct calculations in the sg field theory at the coupling @xmath30 ( semi - classical limit ) and in the free - fermion theory ( equivalent version of the sg field theory at @xmath31 ) , and through the exact specific free energy for the sg field theory , lukyanov and zamolodchikov obtained the exact @xmath27 for the following three special cases : @xmath32 ( semi - classical limit ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively @xcite . and",
    "then , in the same paper , starting from those exact expressions for the special cases , they guessed an exact formula for @xmath27 in the two - dimensional sg field theory at any @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , it is worthwhile checking the conjectured exact formula . in order to do so , in the same paper , defining ",
    "fully connected \" one - point functions , @xmath37 , from the vevs of even - power fields @xmath38 , they showed that @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the above - mentioned exact formula agree with those from perturbation theory for the sg field theory up to @xmath41 and that @xmath39 agrees with the corresponding one - point function from perturbation theory up to @xmath42 the coupling in the massive thirring model , which is the fermion version of the sg field theory @xcite(1975 ) . furthermore",
    ", it was found that the conjectured exact formula can be reobtained from the reflection relations @xcite , supporting it indirectly .",
    "slightly later , in 2000 , checks from perturbation theories in both an angular and a radial quantization approaches for the massive thirring model indicated that the perturbation result up to @xmath42 exactly coincides with the corresponding result obtained by expanding the exact formula according to the coupling @xmath42 @xcite(2000 ) .",
    "in the same year , a numerical study for the model at a finite volume also provides evidence for the conjectured exact formula @xcite(2000 ) . in brief , up to now , the conjectured exact formula for @xmath27 in the two - dimensional sg field theory has been completely checked for the case of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is equivalent to @xmath45 , see eq.(67 ) ) , and received some indirect evidences for its validity .",
    "so , besides providing an example of applying the vp scheme , investigations on @xmath27 will also give the conjectured formula a direct check for the cases of @xmath46 ( ref .",
    "@xcite has provided a partial check for @xmath32 ) .    in section iii",
    ", we will derive the expressions truncated from the vp expansion series on @xmath27 at the second order .",
    "it will be done in three ways .",
    "subsection @xmath20 will directly perform the vp expansion on @xmath27 and then truncate the expansion series at the second order .",
    "since the sg and shg field theories are involved in the class of qfts , eq.(1 ) , so , in subsection @xmath21 , the truncated expressions of @xmath27 up to second order will be recalculated by finishing those ordinary integrations existed in the gaussian smearing formulae in section ii .",
    "the results are identical to those obtained in subsection @xmath20 .",
    "thus , these calculations check and confirm the correctness , usefulness and simplicity of the gaussian smearing formulae in section ii . besides , the vp expansion procedure is formally similar to conventional perturbative expansion , and so the feynman diagrammatic techniques for perturbative theory , which have developed very well up to now , can be borrowed into the vp expansion .",
    "subsection @xmath11 will provide such a calculation on @xmath27 up to the second order in the vp expansion , and the resultant expressions are same as in subsection @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the resultant expressions in sections ii and iii are not the final vp approximate results because the other crucial step of the vp scheme is not yet performed to determine the auxiliary parameter by the pms .",
    "as was aforementioned , sect .",
    "iv will do it by considering the truncated expressions up to the first order in sect .",
    "iii and treat only the case of @xmath25 .",
    "the sg field theory can be transformed into the shg field theory , and so the one - order vp results on the vevs of the exponential fields in the two - dimensional both sg and shg field theories will numerically calculated and be completely compared with the conjectured exact results . for the sg model , we will also compare the one - order vp results here with those from a perturbation theory in ref .",
    "@xcite(poghossian ) .",
    "these comparisons , albeit just the one - order results are considered , not only give a strong support for the conjectured exact results but also indicate usefulness and non - perturbability of the vp scheme here for calculating one - point functions . by the way",
    ", the vp approximate result up to the second order on the vev of the exponential fields in the two - dimensional sg field theories has briefly been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has a less error to the conjectured exact results than the one - order result .",
    "this gives a sign for the convergency of the vp scheme here .",
    "briefly , next section , we will develop the vp scheme by calculating the vev s of the local field , eq.(3 ) , in the qft , eq.(1 ) , and sect .",
    "iii and iv will provide an application of the scheme to the sg and shg field theories .",
    "a brief conclusion will be made in sect . v.",
    "as was stated in the introduction , we will first state the vp scheme in subsection @xmath20 , and then derive the first three terms in the vp expansion series in subsection @xmath21 .",
    "the generating functional is usually the start of discussing a qft and will be the basis for the purpose in the present paper . in this subsection , we will first introduce it , then state our vp scheme .    for any field theory",
    ", one can use either the minkowskian formalism or euclidean formalism to study it @xcite . here , we choose to have our discussion in euclidean formalism .",
    "the euclidean lagrangian corresponding to the minkowskian lagrangian , eq.(1 ) , is @xmath47 which has the same form with the hamiltonian density of eq.(1 ) in @xmath48 spacetime . in euclidean formalism ,",
    "the corresponding generating functional takes the following form @xcite : @xmath49=\\int { \\cal d}\\phi \\exp\\{-\\int d^\\nu \\vec{r } \\ [         { \\frac { 1}{2}}\\nabla_{\\vec{r}}\\phi_{\\vec{r } } \\nabla_{\\vec{r } } \\phi_{\\vec{r}}+ v(\\phi_{\\vec{r } } ) -j_{\\vec{r}}\\phi_{\\vec{r}}\\;]\\ } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where , @xmath50 is the gradient in the @xmath12-dimensional euclidean space , @xmath51 an external source at @xmath52 , and @xmath53 the functional measure . generally , for an interacting system , the right side hand of eq.(5 ) can not exactly be calculated .",
    "but for a free field system with @xmath54 , its generating functional is exactly calculable and plays a crucial role in the vp theory and relevant calculations . for the convenience of later uses , we write down its result as follows @xcite @xmath55&=&\\int { \\cal d}\\phi \\exp\\{-\\int d^\\nu \\vec{r } \\ [ \\ { \\frac { 1}{2}}\\nabla_{\\vec{r } } \\phi_{\\vec{r}}\\nabla_{\\vec{r } } \\phi_{\\vec{r } } + { \\frac { 1}{2 } } \\mu^2 \\phi_{\\vec{r}}^2 -j_{\\vec{r}}\\phi_{\\vec{r}}\\ ] \\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp\\{-{\\frac { 1}{2}}\\int d^\\nu \\vec{r}\\ ; i_{(0)}(\\mu^2)\\}\\exp\\{{\\frac { 1}{2}}jf^{-1}j\\}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath56 with @xmath57 momentum and @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xcite(1990 ) @xmath60 in eq.(7 ) , @xmath61 is the @xmath62th - order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "now we address ourselves to the vevs . for a local field @xmath22 , its vev in the theory with eq.(4 )",
    "is defined as follows @xcite @xmath63 in general , @xmath64 in last equation can not be exactly calculated and one has to manage to design some approximate tool to attack it .    according to eqs.(3),(4 ) and",

    "hence , @xmath64 can be obtained via calculating the generating functional .",
    "luckily , the calculation of effective potential has stimulated the establishment of several vp expansion schemes on the generating functional ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and they can possibly be developed to calculate @xmath64 .",

    "sometimes , it can not give rise to a meaningful solution , and in this case one can render the second derivative zero to determine @xmath74 .",
    "thus the above procedure , truncating the series in eq.(15 ) at some order of @xmath76 and using the pms to determine @xmath74 , provides an approximate method of calculating @xmath64 which can systematically control its approximate accuracy .    in a general",
    ", we can say nothing on the convergent property of eq.(15 ) , let alone on the convergency of the sequence consisting of the truncated results at various orders , because it is difficult to prove their convergency in a general way . nevertheless , from the aforementioned spirit of the pms , the convergency of the sequence of the truncated results determined with the pms to the exact result should be conceivable and understandable . existed",
    "investigations and applications have indicated and illustrated the point . in the early 1980s , stevenson proposed the pms , studied and indicated the efficiency of the pms for keeping the vp theory convergent . in 1990s , it was rigorously proved that it is owing to the pms that the vp theory leads to quickly convergent results on ground state energy for a quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillator @xcite@xcite(2004 ) , and recently , the rigorous proofs of the convergency on the vp theory have been given to the critical o(n ) scalar field theory @xcite .",
    "from these existed investigations , the vp scheme of calculating vevs in the present paper is presumably convergent , because , frankly , it is just a generalization of the existed vp schemes of calculating energy , free energy , effective potentials , and so on . as was aforementioned , a brief report in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest a sign on the convergency of the vpt scheme here . in the present paper",
    ", we will not discuss the convergent problem .",
    "the vp scheme of calculating vevs stated in the above is a non - perturbative method .",
    "the expansion in eq.(15 ) in terms of @xmath76 is intrinsically different in nature from a conventional perturbation expansion in terms of the interaction coupling , albeit they are formally similar to each other .",
    "the key point of the reliable approximate results from conventional perturbation expansion consists in the requirement of weak couplings , whereas the crucial point of the reliable and fast convergent approximate results from the vp expansion consists in the requirement of most insensitivity of the truncated results to the auxiliary parameter .",
    "it is due to the adjustability of the auxiliary parameter that the expansion in eq.(15 ) has no limitations both to the formal expansion factor @xmath76 ( in fact , @xmath80 is taken eventually ) and to the coupling . in the vp expansion",
    ", there exists the adjustable term , @xmath88 , besides the original interaction terms ( see eq.(12 ) ) , and the propagator eq.(7 ) , which is embraced in the unexpanded part of @xmath79 $ ] , also contains the adjustable parameter , @xmath74 .",
    "so it is conceivable that for a different value of the coupling ( weak or strong ) , one can adjust the value of @xmath74 through the pms to get to a reliable approximate result of @xmath64 .",
    "the existed investigations have indicated the non - perturbability of the vp theory . in section iv",
    ", we will provide a comparison of the vp theory here with perturbation theory to illustrate the non - perturbative property of the vp scheme here .",

    "<S> in this paper , we develop a variational perturbation ( vp ) scheme for calculating vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of local fields in quantum field theories . for a comparatively general scalar field model , </S>",
    "<S> the vev of a comparatively general local field is expanded and truncated at second order in the vp scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant truncated expressions ( we call gaussian smearing formulae ) consist mainly of gaussian transforms of the local - field function , the model - potential function and their derivatives , and so can be used to skip calculations on path integrals in a concrete theory . as an application , </S>",
    "<S> the vp expansion series of the vev of a local exponential field in the sine- and sinh - gordon field theories is truncated and derived up to second order equivalently by directly performing the vp scheme , by finishing ordinary integrations in the gaussian smearing formulae , and by borrowing feynman diagrammatic technique , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the one - order vp results of the vev in the two - dimensional sine- and sinh - gordon field theories are numerically calculated and compared with the exact results conjectured by lukyanov , zamolodchikov @xmath0 , or with the one - order perturbative results obtained by poghossian . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons provide a strong support to the conjectured exact formulae and illustrate non - perturbability of the vp scheme . </S>"
