    "the nature and consequences for confinement and chiral - symmetry breaking of long - range gluon fields in the vacuum have been the subject of extended investigation . while many studies rely on one or more of the specific configurations of monopoles , vortices and instantons , there are arguments @xcite that in fact the complete hierarchy of singular gauge fields must play a role , especially if these objects condense in the vacuum .",
    "it is natural then to seek a model in which the bulk properties of this hierarchy can be effectively represented .",
    "we partially do this here by introducing a model for such fields in which singularities in vector potentials are concentrated on three - dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath0 in euclidean space , in the vicinity of which gauge fields can be divided into a sum of a singular pure gauge @xmath1 and a regular fluctuation part @xmath2 , and where a certain @xmath3 colour vector @xmath4 can be associated with @xmath1 .",
    "thus we have idealised the situation by ignoring lower dimensional singular objects which would appear as `` dislocations '' at the abelian domain wall singularities .",
    "the requirement of finiteness of the action ( density ) for singular background plus fluctuation parts for configurations dominating the functional integral  @xcite can be formalised in our case as specific boundary conditions on @xmath5 for the fluctuation fields charged with respect to @xmath6 . the interiors of these regions thus constitute `` domains '' @xmath7 .",
    "gauge field modes neutral with respect to @xmath8 are not restricted and generate interactions between domains .    within the present framework",
    "then , we decompose a general gauge field @xmath9 and demanding finiteness of the classical action density at the singularity we come to the conditions @xmath10 for gluons , and @xmath11 for quarks .",
    "the adjoint matrix @xmath12 appears in the condition for gluons , and a bag - like boundary condition arises for quarks , with a unit vector @xmath13 normal to @xmath0 .    in a given domain @xmath7 the effect of fluctuations in neighbouring regions",
    "can be seen as an external gauge field @xmath14 neutral with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "this enables an approximation in which different domains are assumed to be decoupled from each other but , to compensate , a certain mean field is introduced in domain interiors . to make the model analytically tractable we consider spherical domains with fixed radius @xmath15 and approximate the mean field in @xmath7 by a configuration with the field strength @xmath16 , which is ( anti-)self - dual @xmath17 so that @xmath18 , with @xmath19 a constant the same for all domains .",
    "the constant colour matrix @xmath20 belongs to the cartan subalgebra with angles @xmath21 corresponding to the weyl subgroup .",
    "there is no source for this field on the boundary and therefore it should be treated as strictly homogeneous in all further calculations .",
    "the homogeneity itself appears here just as an approximation .",
    "thus the partition function we will deal with can be written @xmath22 \\delta_{\\rm fp}[\\breve{\\cal b}^{(i)},q^{(i ) } ] \\nonumber \\\\ { } & { } & \\times   \\exp\\left\\ { - s_{v_i}^{\\rm qcd } \\left[q^{(i)}+{\\cal b}^{(i)},\\psi^{(i)},\\bar\\psi^{(i)}\\right ] \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the gluons and quarks are integrated over the spaces @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , and the thermodynamic limit assumes @xmath25 but with the density @xmath26 taken fixed and finite .",
    "the measure of integration over parameters characterising domains is defined as @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are spherical angles of the chromomagnetic field , @xmath30 is the angle between the chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields , @xmath31 is the angle in the colour matrix @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the chiral angle and @xmath34 is the centre of the domain @xmath35 .",
    "this partition function describes a statistical system of density @xmath36 composed of noninteracting extended domain - like structures , each of which is characterised by a set of internal parameters and whose internal dynamics are represented by the fluctuation fields .",
    "in this model the connected @xmath37point correlator of field strength tensors , @xmath38 can be calculated explicitly using the measure , eq .  ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "translation - invariant functions @xmath39 emerge and can be seen as the volume of the region of overlap of @xmath40 hyperspheres of radius @xmath15 and centres ( @xmath41 ) , normalised to the volume of a single hypersphere @xmath42 .",
    "the functions @xmath43 are continuous and vanish if @xmath44 .",
    "correlations in the background field have finite range @xmath45 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath43 is then an entire analytical function and thus correlations do not have a particle interpretation .",
    "the statistical ensemble of background fields is not gaussian since all connected correlators are independent of each other and can not be reduced to the two - point correlations .",
    "the simplest application of the above correlators gives a gluon condensate density which to this approximation is @xmath46    another vacuum parameter which plays a significant role in the resolution of the @xmath47 problem is the topological susceptibility @xcite . to define this we consider first the topological charge density @xmath48 which to lowest order is @xmath49\\cos\\omega_j , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 depends on the duality of the @xmath51-th domain .",
    "for a given field configuration the topological charge is additive @xmath52 for @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a ` unit ' topological charge , namely the absolute value of the topological charge of a single domain , and @xmath55 @xmath56 is the number of domains with ( anti-)self - dual field , @xmath57 .",
    "the probability of finding the topological charge @xmath58 in a given configuration is defined by the ratio of the number of configurations @xmath59 with a charge @xmath58 and the total number of configurations @xmath60 , @xmath61 the distribution is symmetric about @xmath62 , where it has a maximum for @xmath63 even .",
    "for @xmath63 odd the maximum is at @xmath64 . averaged topological charge is zero .    the topological susceptibility @xmath65 is determined by the two - point correlator of topological charge density , which in the lowest approximation gives @xmath66",
    "to zeroth order in fluctuations the wilson loop can be written @xmath67 where stokes theorem has been used .",
    "note that path ordering in our case is not necessary since the matrices @xmath68 are assumed to be in the cartan subalgebra .",
    "computationally it is convenient to consider a circular contour in the @xmath69 plane of radius @xmath70 with centre at the origin .",
    "details of the calculation are given in @xcite .",
    "put briefly , the colour trace is evaluated exactly followed by the integration over orientations of the vacuum field . integrating over the domain centres and taking the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) , one obtains for a large wilson loop @xmath73 @xmath74^n = e^{-u(l ) }     \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the exponent @xmath75 displaying an area law with string tension for @xmath76 given by @xmath77 with the function @xmath78 having a purely geometrical origin .",
    "this function is positive for @xmath79 and has a maximum for @xmath80 .",
    "we choose this maximum to estimate the model parameters by fitting the string constant to the lattice result , @xmath81 and get for the gluonic parameters of the vacuum @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while the density of the system is @xmath84 .",
    "there is no separation of characteristic scales @xmath85 , hence an approximation based on large or small domains is not justifiable and has been not used here .",
    "if @xmath19 goes to zero then the string constant vanishes .",
    "this underscores the role of the gluon condensate in the confinement of static charges . on the other hand , if the number of domains is fixed and the thermodynamic limit is defined as @xmath86 , namely if the domains are macroscopically large , then @xmath87 , which indicates the absence of a linear potential between infinitely massive charges in a purely homogeneous field .",
    "an area law obviously does not occur for adjoint charges because of the presence of zero eigenvalues of the adjoint matrix @xmath88 .",
    "confinement of the fluctuation fields can be seen in the analytical properties of their propagators . for the above boundary conditions the fluctuation quark and gluon propagators can be analytically calculated by reduction to the charged scalar field problem .",
    "this in turn is essentially just that of a four - dimensional harmonic oscillator with the orbital momentum coupled to the external field , and the general solution has been found exactly by decomposition over hyperspherical harmonics @xcite .    due to the above boundary conditions the @xmath89space propagators of charged fields are defined in regions of finite support where they have integrable singularities so that their fourier transforms are entire functions in the complex momentum plane",
    "this is consistent with a confinement of dynamical fields@xcite .",
    "entire propagators have the physically appealing property of a regge spectrum of relativistic bound states@xcite .",
    "turning to quarks specifically , we address the eigenvalue problem for the massless dirac operator in a domain , @xmath90 subject to the boundary condition eq.([bc ] ) .",
    "we introduce projectors in the colour direction @xmath91 and spin projection with respect to the magnetic field @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the mixed projector @xmath94 .",
    "substituting @xmath95 shows that @xmath96 satisfies @xmath97 whose exact solution is given in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that it is impossible to fulfill the boundary condition eq.([bc ] ) with the term @xmath98 in eq.([q - pr1 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath99 must have definite chirality corresponding to the duality of the vacuum gluon field .",
    "the boundary condition enforces a discretisation of the eigenvalues @xmath100 .",
    "the states are then labelled by the set of quantum numbers : @xmath101 with @xmath102 a radial quantum number labelling the solutions of the boundary condition for given @xmath103 angular quantum numbers @xmath104 , @xmath105 corresponding to the colour projection with respect to @xmath106 and @xmath107 representing the spin projection with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "zero modes are absent under chosen boundary conditions .",
    "the eigenspinors have the structure @xmath108 where spinors @xmath109 and @xmath110 as well as the constraints defining the corresponding eigenvalues are known in analytical form and will be discussed in detail elsewhere  . for illustration we give the eigenvalue equations for the purely radial @xmath111 modes . with @xmath112 , @xmath113",
    "we have the equation for @xmath114 @xmath115 and that for @xmath116 @xmath117 \\nonumber \\\\ + e^{\\mp i\\alpha}\\lambda m\\left(\\lambda^2 + 2,2,z\\right)=0 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath118 and @xmath119 . here",
    "@xmath120 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "the sign minus ( plus ) in front of @xmath121 corresponds to the ( anti-)self - dual domain .    with these solutions",
    "we investigate the chirality of the eigenmodes and also how their probability density correlates with the underlying domain .",
    "following @xcite we introduce the local chirality parameter @xmath122 defined via @xmath123 which will give extremal values @xmath124 at positions @xmath125 where @xmath126 is purely right(left ) handed . for lattice overlap fermions , even in uncooled gauge fields , histograms of @xmath127 measured at probability density maxima for low - lying overlap - dirac eigenmodes",
    "show peaks close to the extremal values @xcite .",
    "this indicates that low - lying modes are strongly chiral and are thus a useful filter for the duality of `` objects '' underlying the gauge field fluctuations .      within the present model we observe",
    "that at the centres of domains all of the eigenmodes are exactly chiral and probability densities are maximal .",
    "the `` width '' of the peaks for the lowest modes at half - maximum varies for different values @xmath129 and is of the order of @xmath130 , consistent with the lattice observations of @xcite . as is seen from fig.([fig : x ] ) the chirality of the lowest mode ( @xmath131 ) monotonically decreases with distance from the centre .",
    "the chirality parameter for the excited modes alternates between extremal values , the number of alternations is correlated with the radial number @xmath40 , and the half - width decreases with growing @xmath40 .",
    "the chirality parameter is zero at the boundary for all modes .",
    "qualitatively this picture does not depend on angle @xmath129 .",
    "the degree of chirality of the modes can be conveniently characterized via a histogram if we average x(x ) over a small neighborhood of the domain centre .",
    "then , by assuming that all values of @xmath129 are equally probable we compute the probability to find a given value of smeared @xmath127 among a set of modes .",
    "the result given in fig.([fig : x - hist ] ) was obtained for the lowest modes with all possible spin - color orientaions .",
    "we observe the double peaking close to the extrema with @xmath132 . including higher modes",
    "will broaden the peaks and build up a central plateau .",
    "this feature as well as the above mentioned values for the half - decay and the density of domains is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "however , at this stage , it would be premature to go beyond purely numerical comparison of our results and those of the lattice .",
    "finally , we quote the estimate of the quark condensate density averaged over ( anti-)self - dual configurations and @xmath129 obtained in  @xcite directly from the quark propagator . for @xmath19 and @xmath15 as in eq .",
    "( [ par - val ] ) the density at the domain center is equal to @xmath134 it should be stressed that this nonzero result is due to the non - integral topological charge @xmath135 associated with domains .",
    "this and our results for the chirality parameter @xmath127 suggest that the underlying mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking here is the strong chirality of the low - lying non - zero modes , which in turn is a consequence of the ( anti-)self - duality of the background gluonic configurations and their non - integral topological charge .",
