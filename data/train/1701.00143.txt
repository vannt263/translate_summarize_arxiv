    "silica aerogel was among the first aerogel materials to be created from wet gel via supercritical drying @xcite that comprises three - dimensional networks of silicon dioxide ( sio@xmath3 ) clusters and air - filled open pores of nanometer - scale dimensions .",
    "silica aerogel ( hereafter referred to simply as _ aerogel _ ) is essentially transparent under visible light ; however , its transparency depends on its mesoporous nanostructure , which is controlled mainly by sol ",
    "gel polymerization in the wet - gel synthesis step . during this step ,",
    "the bulk density of the aerogel can be tuned by varying the ratio of the silica precursor to the diluent solvent ( e.g. , 0.020.5 g/@xmath1 @xcite ) . besides ultralow - density aerogel ( 0.01 g/@xmath1 or less ) @xcite , researchers have prepared ( ultra)high - density aerogel ( 0.21.0 g/@xmath1 ) by applying the pin - drying technique to the synthesized wet gel @xcite .",
    "native aerogel is hydrophilic , but can be rendered hydrophobic by modification of the silanol groups ( si  oh ) on the surface of the silica clusters @xcite . using recent techniques , hydrophobic , transparent aerogel blocks can be fabricated over a wide density range ( 0.011.0 g/@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the refractive index ( @xmath4 ) of the aerogel is empirically proportional to its density ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a coefficient that depends on the light wavelength ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "this expression is theoretically derived from the lorentz ",
    "lorenz formula ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    over three decades , we have been developing transparent silica aerogel with a wide range of refractive indices for use in scientific instruments , especially in cherenkov radiators @xcite .",

    "the belle ii will succeed the belle experiment . from 1999 to 2010 , belle contributed remarkably to precise tests of the standard model of particle physics by measuring the decay modes of _ b _ mesons generated by the annihilation of electron  positron pairs @xcite .",
    "one of the particle identification devices in the belle ii detector system ( under construction ) is an aerogel - based ring - imaging cherenkov ( a - rich ) counter .",
    "this counter is installed at the forward end cap region and requires a large number of transparent silica aerogel tiles with different refractive indices as the cherenkov radiator @xcite .",

    "the final tile dimensions were determined from the results of the present study .",
    "the goal of the present study is to reduce the adjacent cherenkov radiator boundaries by minimizing the number of tiles that fill the radiator plane , which is vital for achieving high detector performance over the broad end cap area .",
    "this is equivalent to maximizing the tile cross - section of the 2 cm - thick aerogel radiator . thus far ,",
    "aerogel tiles with dimensions of up to 15 @xmath0 15 @xmath0 2 @xmath1 have been fabricated @xcite , but the crack - free production yield was unstable ( e.g. , 5080% ) . mass production of larger , crack - free aerogel tiles with the same high optical characteristics of small size aerogel tiles presents a major challenge .",
    "the optical requirements are the apparent refractive index , the transmission length defined in section [ 5 - 2 - 1 ] , and uniform internal tile density ( i.e. , refractive index uniformity ) .",
    "specifically , the refractive indices must be 1.045 @xmath11 0.002 , 1.050 @xmath11 0.002 , and 1.055 @xmath11 0.002 , and the acceptable transmission lengths ( measured at @xmath8 = 400 nm ) are 45 , 40 , and 35 mm or more , respectively .",

    "all of the aerogel tiles obtained from mold types 14 and 13 were cracked , and only 2 of the 12 tiles obtained from mold type 12 were crack - free .",
    "these wet gel tiles were difficult to handle without cracking on account of their large area and asymmetric ( i.e. , rectangular ) shape .",
    "that is , many of the wet gel tiles had internal cracks before the scd . in the reference mold , 3 out of 6 tiles were crack - free .",
    "we considered that crack - free aerogel tiles would be difficult to produce in mold types 14 and 13 , even if the scd procedure was improved in the next production .",
    "based on our experiences with homebuilt supercritical drying apparatus , including the 7.6 l autoclave at chiba university @xcite , we modified the scd process in later productions .",

    "the conditions were then statically maintained at 30@xmath18c and 6.5 mpa for 45 h , so that the liquefied co@xmath3 was well mixed with 2-propanol . at chiba university , this static customization step required approximately 12 h ; thus , the additional 33 h may be redundant in the present study . during this step , the moderate solvent exchange from 2-propanol to liquefied co@xmath3 relaxed the stress on the silica matrix . in the secondary pressurization step ,",
    "the maximum scd pressure was lowered to 10 mpa ( previously to 15.7 mpa ) .",
    "the pumping rate of scco@xmath3 was then slightly decreased .",
    "finally , to suppress cracking , the pressure was very slowly reduced from 10 mpa to atmospheric over a period of 20 h ( previously from 15.7 mpa over a period of 7 h ) .",
    "the modified scd process showed promise in suppressing the aerogel cracking . in the second production , batches 1 and 3 , which were dried by the modified process ,",
    "were compared with batch 2 , which was dried by the conventional process .",
    "the wet gel tiles were on the whole crack free before the scd . in the conventional process using mold type 12 ( batch 2 ) , only 2 out of 12 tiles were crack - free , reproducing the result of the first production .",
    "the modified process increased the crack - free tile yield to 50% ; i.e. , batch 1 ( 3 ) yielded 5 ( 4 ) crack - free tiles out of 12 ( 8) tiles .",

    "although no apparent coloration was observed in these tiles , their amplitudes @xmath22 ( or transmittances at @xmath8 = 800 nm ) were obviously low ( typically decreased by 5 percentage points ) relative to the healthy tiles ) , indicating the presence of chromatic contamination .",

    "the apparent refractive index of the manufactured aerogel tiles seems to slightly depend on the temperature in the laboratory of the wet gel synthesis and processing .",

    "in contrast , the refractive indices of tiles within a batch which were synthesized by the same recipe showed little variation ( small standard deviation ) .",
    "the difference in the refractive index of aerogel tiles produced in summer and winter reflected the difference in their tile densities , which can be partly explained by differences in the longitudinal tile shrinkage ratio .",
    "the mean side lengths of tiles manufactured in summer and winter were 182.5 and 181.5 mm respectively , corresponding to a longitudinal shrinkage ratio of 97.6 and 97.1% from the mold size of 187.0 mm ( type a ) , respectively .",

    "considering the relationship between the refractive index and density [ i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) ] and using the parameters given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference in the refractive index is consistent with the density difference , allowing for conversion error .    apart from tile shrinkage , the nanoscopic structures ( silica clusters and pores ) of tiles produced in summer or winter could affect the refractive indices .",
    "the gelation time , and hence the formation of the nanoscopic gel structure , depends on the room temperature of the wet gel synthesis . supporting this inference ,",
    "the aerogel transparency depends on the gelation time ; the shorter the gelation time , the more transparent the aerogel . differences in nanoscopic structure should directly alter the refractive index .",
    "moreover , the increased aerogel density may be attributed to increased numbers of hydrophobic groups added in the hydrophobic treatment , which also depends on the nanoscopic structure .    in the present study ,",
    "the differences in refractive indices were apparently unaffected by the scd process .",
    "in fact , the 9 tiles dried in batch 2 of the sixth production ( in summer ) were synthesized as spare tiles during the fifth production ( in winter ) .",
    "that is , prior to scd , the spare wet gel tiles were preserved in the 2-propanol bath for approximately half a year .",
    "the mean refractive index of 2 samples synthesized in winter and dried in summer was 1.0505 ( the target @xmath4 of both samples was 1.050 ) . the mean refractive index ( and standard deviation ) of 5 tiles targeting @xmath4 = 1.050 from batch 2 of the fifth ( winter ) production was 1.0504 @xmath11 0.0002 , whereas that of 5 tiles from batch 1 of the sixth ( summer ) production was 1.0476 @xmath11 0.0001 .",

    "the six samples are identified by numbers ( i.e. , 16 ) .",
    "the transmittance of each tile was measured at three positions on the tile surface ( i.e. , at near the tile center and left and right sides ) and averaged . at these positions ,",
    "the transmittances were very similar before and after the cutting , but were not identical because the tile shape affects the setup of the aerogel samples in the spectrophotometer .",
    "the water jet machining exerted no significant effect on the transmission lengths of the aerogel tiles .",
    "circles and squares indicate the transmission lengths before and after water jet machining , respectively .",
    "the error is the standard deviation of the measurements at three tile positions.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    two characteristic lengths of four fully trimmed aerogel tiles were measured with a ruler .",
    "the trimming error in the tile dimensions was below 1% .",
    "although the true size was slightly smaller than the design size , the dimensions were acceptable and guaranteed safe installation of the aerogel tiles into the radiator support structures .",
    "based on the present study , a second machining test was performed on aerogel tiles that were mass - produced for the actual a - rich counter .",
    "these tiles were successfully installed in a partial mock - up of the aerogel support structure @xcite .",
    "prototypes of silica aerogel tiles have been developed for use in the a - rich counter of the belle ii detector .",
    "the tiles are to be installed as cherenkov radiators .",
    "the a - rich counter demands large - area aerogel segments to fill the 3.5-m@xmath9 cylindrical end cap with the minimum number of two - layer radiators . based on the results of the present study ,",
    "the installation of 248 fan - shaped radiator segments trimmed from 18 @xmath0 18 @xmath0 2 @xmath1 aerogel tiles was planned .",
    "herein , the methodologies for synthesizing the wet gel tiles and rendering them hydrophobic were described . for safe radiator installation and high detector performance , large - area ,",
    "high - density aerogel tiles with no cracking after the supercritical co@xmath3 drying step are required .",
    "the aerogel cracking was effectively suppressed by applying moderate pressure control in the drying procedure . by perfecting our technique , large - area aerogel tiles with a consistently high ( @xmath1380% ) crack - free yield",
    "were eventually obtained .",
    "moreover , the refractive indices of the aerogel tiles ( nominally , @xmath4 = 1.045 , 1.050 , and 1.055 ) were precisely controlled while maintaining high transmission lengths ( 45 , 40 , and 35 mm , respectively ) . in monolithic aerogel tiles with different refractive index targets ,",
    "the density ( i.e. , refractive index ) distribution along the transverse planar direction was almost uniform , meeting our requirements .",

    "the a - rich counter identifies @xmath29-meson decay products ( e.g. , charged @xmath41 and @xmath42 mesons ) by the cherenkov imaging technique .",
    "a charged particle radiates light if its velocity ( @xmath43 ) exceeds the local phase velocity of light ( cherenkov radiation ) ; specifically , if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the speed of light in a vacuum .",
    "the angle @xmath46 of the cherenkov radiation relative to the particle s direction is given by @xmath47 . under the specified refractive index conditions , the a - rich counter separates kaons from pions using their cherenkov angle information ( i.e. , differences in their cherenkov ring radii ) and the supplementary particle velocities ( momenta ) provided by a charged particle trajectory tracking device @xcite in a 1.5-t magnetic field .",
    "the a - rich counter comprises the aerogel cherenkov radiator tiles , a position - sensitive hybrid photodetector array @xcite , dedicated front - end readout electronics @xcite , and their mechanical support structures .",
    "the cherenkov ring image that includes the cherenkov angle information is observed by pixelated photodetectors placed 20 cm downstream of the aerogel radiator surface , and is reconstructed by analyzing the cherenkov ring radii .",
    "the cherenkov ring images are compiled from the single photon counts obtained by the position - sensitive photodetectors , which are designed to operate in the magnetic field .    in the previous belle experiment , particle identification at the end cap",
    "was achieved by threshold - type aerogel cherenkov counter ( acc ) modules with @xmath4 = 1.03 radiators @xcite . in a single module of the counters with functionality in the magnetic field",
    ", the photodetector ( comprising two fine mesh - type photomultiplier tubes ) was directly attached to the counter - housing filled with aerogel blocks .",
    "the acc separated pions from kaons in the momentum range 0.62 gev/@xmath45 ; that is , the @xmath4 = 1.03 aerogel blocks emitted cherenkov light only when pions within the specified momentum range passed through the counter module .",
    "particle identification at high momenta ( up to 4 gev/@xmath45 ) remained an open problem in the belle experiment , to be resolved by replacing the acc system with the a - rich counter system . to overcome the limited installation space for the a - rich counter , the a - rich system was designed as a proximity focusing rich counter with limited radiator thickness .",
    "this design obtains thin cherenkov ring images without mirror focusing ( i.e. , introduces an expansion space between the radiator and photodetector ) @xcite .",
    "the refractive index of the aerogel cherenkov radiators in the a - rich counter was selected as @xmath131.05 . to observe the cherenkov light emission triggered by high - energy mesons ( charged pions and kaons with momenta up to 4 gev/@xmath45 ) passing through the aerogel",
    ", the radiator s refractive index must exceed @xmath131.008 .",
    "high @xmath4 is desirable for increasing the photon emission by the cherenkov radiator .",
    "conversely , increasing the @xmath4 generally decreases the transparency of the aerogel @xcite , degrading the cherenkov photon collection .",
    "as described in the current paper , the upstream surface of the aerogel tiles was separated from the photodetector surface by 20 cm . in radiators with @xmath4 = 1.05 , the cherenkov angles of 4 gev/@xmath45 pions and kaons differ by approximately 23 mrad , corresponding to 5 mm on the photodetection plane . given the pixel size of the photodetector under development ( approximately 5 @xmath0 5 mm@xmath9 ) , this difference is detectable . in the 1990s",
    ", we achieved the most transparent aerogels to date with @xmath4 = 1.021.03 @xcite . in recent studies",
    ", we successfully exceeded this transparency with higher @xmath4 range ( @xmath4 = 1.041.05 ) by applying dmf as the diluent solvent in the sol ",
    "gel polymerization step ( i.e. , by modifying the kek method ) @xcite . experimentally fabricated small - size aerogel tiles with @xmath4 = 1.041.06 showed promising performance in test beam experiments .",
    "however , the photodetector in these tests was a position - sensitive multi - anode photomultiplier tube array , which does not operate in the magnetic field @xcite",
    ".    the a - rich counter will employ a focusing dual - layer aerogel radiator scheme with different refractive indices @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figs1 ] .",
    "the higher - refractive - index aerogel tiles are arranged behind tiles with lower refractive index , such that the cherenkov photons emitted from both layers focus on the photodetection plane . in this scheme ,",
    "the thick aerogel radiators increase the cherenkov photon emission , yet the cherenkov angle resolution is not degraded by emission point uncertainty in the aerogel tile .",
    "the appropriate combination of refractive indices is determined by the particle velocity , the distance between the radiator and photodetection plane , and the aerogel thickness .",
    "assuming 2 cm - thick aerogels in each layer , the candidates are @xmath4 = 1.045 and 1.055 or @xmath4 = 1.050 and 1.060 .",
    "the aerogel thickness was constrained by the difficulty of producing large - area , high - refractive - index , crack - free aerogel tiles with thicknesses exceeding 2 cm .",
    "the target transmission length of the a - rich counter is approximately 40 mm at @xmath8 = 400 nm .",
    "although aerogel is essentially transparent to visible light , light scattering is non - negligible at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath8 @xmath13400 nm ) , where most photodetectors exhibit peak quantum efficiency .",
    "only the cherenkov photons that are not scattered in the aerogel radiator are valuable , because they preserve the cherenkov angle information . by investigating small aerogel tiles synthesized by the modified kek method ,",
    "the approximate transmission lengths of tiles with @xmath4 = 1.045 , 1.050 , 1.055 , and 1.060 were determined as approximately 45 , 40 , 35 , and 30 mm , respectively @xcite . among these ,",
    "the transmission length of 30 mm at @xmath4 = 1.060 was discarded , because transparent downstream aerogels are vital in the focusing radiator scheme .",
    "specifically , all of the emitted cherenkov photons must pass through the downstream aerogel layer .",
    "high - refractive - index aerogel tiles can also be fabricated by the pin drying technique @xcite .",
    "this method was first explored for producing ultrahigh density aerogel blocks with refractive indices exceeding 1.10 . by this technique , extremely transparent aerogel tiles with @xmath21.06",
    "were fabricated ; i.e. , the transmission length was almost doubled @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the crack - free yield of large - area pin - dried aerogel tiles never exceeded 50% in the developmental phase , so the technique was abandoned @xcite .",
    "the other optical requirements of the radiator are the correct combination of refractive indices in the focusing dual - layer aerogel scheme , and uniform tile density . assuming that each aerogel tile in the a - rich counter is 2 cm thick , the refractive indices of the upstream and downstream layers must differ by 0.01 .",
    "deviations from the best refractive index combination must not exceed @xmath110.002 ; greater deviations will degrade the detector performance ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to ensure superior detector performance over the large - area radiator plane ,",
    "the uniformity of each monolithic aerogel tile must fulfill a similar condition : @xmath40 4% ( i.e. , @xmath39 4% ) .",
    "the fabricated aerogel tiles should be as large as possible , because the detector performance decreases at the boundaries between adjacent radiators in rich counters @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in our test beam experiment @xcite .",
    "large - area aerogel tiles also increase the detector acceptance .",
    "conversely , the tile size was limited by the capacity of the autoclave in the scd apparatus . in the present study ,",
    "the dedicated 140 l autoclave was employed at mohri oil mill , and planned to do the same for the upcoming mass - production .",
    "the diameter of the wet gel rack inserted into the autoclave was approximately 41 cm . therefore , the dimensions of the aerogel tiles demand a trade - off among the sizes of the wet gel rack , the wet - gel tile size that can be safely handled , and the efficiency of mass production .",
    "cracks in the aerogel tile must be avoided at all costs , for several reasons .",
    "first , they cause unwanted scattering of cherenkov photons in the aerogel tile , losing the cherenkov angle information .",
    "second , cracked tiles might disintegrate along the crack plane after water jet machining .",
    "finally , cracks reduce the mechanical strength of the tiles , compromising the safety of radiator assembly and installation .",
