    "multiple - spin exchange interactions have attracted much interest for a long time .",
    "these interactions appears either as many - body direct exchange processes@xcite or as higher - order corrections in the strong - coupling expansion of the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "@xcite in most cases ( especially in mott insulators ) , the four - spin ring ( or cyclic ) exchange is rather small compared with the usual heisenberg term .",
    "however , it may play a significant role in @xmath0he , where hardcore repulsion makes many - body exchanges more likely than the standard two - body one , and mott insulators close to the metal - insulator transitions .",
    "in fact , such interactions are expected to be crucial for explaining unusual magnetic behavior in @xmath0he absorbed on graphite@xcite , wigner crystals @xcite and some mott insulators on triangular lattices.@xcite the relevance of the four - spin cyclic exchange has also been reported@xcite in fully describing the inelastic neutron - scattering experiments for such cuprates as la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , la@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 , la@xmath2ca@xmath7cu@xmath5o@xmath6 , cacu@xmath1o@xmath8 , and srcu@xmath1o@xmath8 .",
    "a second motivation to investigate multiple - spin exchange interactions stems from the exotic physics that emerges from their competition with the heisenberg spin exchange .",
    "for instance , certain sorts of spin nematic phases are known to be stabilized in some two - dimensional heisenberg magnets with ring - exchange interaction . @xcite",
    "also multiple - spin exchanges can lead to new emerging quantum critical behaviors like the deconfined quantum criticality @xcite or the spin bose - metal .",
    "@xcite on top of these novel phases , even more exotic topological phases have been predicted to be realized with such interactions .",
    "@xcite    a paradigmatic and minimal model that realizes these two aspects of the multiple - spin exchange interactions would be the two - leg spin ladder with a ring - exchange : @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denotes the spin-1/2 operator on the chain-@xmath12 and the rung @xmath13 of the spin ladder .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively are the intrachain- and the interchain exchange coupling ( fig .",

    "all phases are gapful except the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the four - spin cyclic exchange manifests itself by stabilizing the scalar chirality phase , which spontaneously breaks the time - reversal symmetry , and the vc phase .",
    "the latter phase has a unique singlet ground state with a finite gap . in sharp contrast to the usual rs phase of the two - leg spin ladder , the lowest triplet excitation of the vc phase is not the standard triplon created by the spin operators @xmath10 but is built from the vector chirality @xmath17 as we will show below",
    "consequently , the dominant ground - state correlations of this phase occur not in the spin - spin channel but rather in the vector - chirality channel.@xcite the relationship between the rs and vc phases can be simply understood by means of a spin - chirality duality transformation .",

    "@xcite in this basis , the spin - chirality transformation ( [ spinchirality ] ) has a simple interpretation as the u(1 ) gauge transformation of the bosons.@xcite the next step of the approach is to perform a simple mean - field approximation of the phases of the bosonic model .",
    "we then incorporate quantum fluctuations by constructing semiclassical low - energy hamiltonians which describe the competition of the rs and the vc orders as well as the usual rotational fluctuations .",
