    "the recent discovery of coherent thz radiation emitted from mesas of the high - temperature superconductor bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bscco ) has caused a great deal of excitement@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "rectangular mesas were fashioned by ar ion milling of a single crystal of bscco , with a au layer covering the mesa s top , to which an electrical lead was attached , and two additional electrical leads were attached to the remaining bscco crystal substrate .",
    "typical rectangular mesa dimensions were @xmath4 m . by applying a static ( @xmath0 ) voltage @xmath5 across the mesa ,",
    "the @xmath1 josephson effect was generated in each of the @xmath6 junctions involved in the mesa , and coherent @xmath1 josephson radiation at thz frequencies was emitted .",
    "the @xmath1 josephson relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the magnitude of the cooper pair charge and @xmath9 is planck s constant divided by @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ nuj ] ) relates the @xmath1 josephson frequency @xmath11 to the applied @xmath12 . to avoid confusion , here we write @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the wave vectors and positions outside the mesa , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the wave vectors and positions inside the mesa",
    ". since the frequencies are the same inside and outside the mesa , they are left unprimed .",
    "since bscco is a stack of josephson junctions , with atomically thin superconducting layers separated by thicker dielectric layers , it is extremely anisotropic .",
    "in analogy with standard antenna theory@xcite , to zeroth order , one might consider a bscco mesa to be a dielectric sandwiched between two metallic layers , forming a cavity that produces the electric field that generates the radiation@xcite .",
    "in this model , it was usually assumed that the @xmath1 component of the electric field @xmath17 and the @xmath1 josephson supercurrent @xmath18 both had antisymmetric spatial configurations , with maxima along the length @xmath19 edges , and a node in the center of the mesas of width @xmath20 , leading to a radiation fundamental wavelength @xmath21 , and a finite magnetic field @xmath22 along the radiating mesa edges , as noted in the following .",
    "the wave vectors of very thin rectangular cavity modes are @xmath23^{1/2},\\label{krectangle } \\label{omegamp }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are integers , when there is no spatial variation of the electromagnetic fields in the @xmath26 direction normal to the layers .",
    "these modes are generated from the boundary conditions , which allow for half - integral multiples of wavelengths across the width and the length of the cavity .",
    "usually , such modes in a cavity that is open on the sides only arises when the @xmath1 magnetic field @xmath22 vanishes at the edge of the cavity , forcing the normal derivative of @xmath17 to vanish there .",
    "other mechanisms for the formation of such half - integral modes have also been proposed , as discussed in the following . inside the mesa ,",
    "electromagnetic waves propagate parallel to the layers according to the dispersion relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the index of refraction , and @xmath29 for bscco in the relevant frequency range@xcite . by varying the @xmath0 @xmath5 experimentally",
    ", radiation is found to occur after one of the harmonic @xmath1 josephson frequencies @xmath30 locks onto a particular @xmath31 rectangular cavity mode , @xmath32 in experiments on rectangular samples , it appears that the fundamental @xmath33 @xmath1 josephson frequency @xmath34 locks onto the rectangular cavity @xmath35 mode , so that @xmath36 , also allowing for the higher @xmath1 josephson harmonics with @xmath37 to lock onto the higher cavity @xmath38 modes , where @xmath39 .",
    "one might wonder why the low energy excitations were not along the length of the rectangular mesa , rather than along the width , as observed experimentally . although the experiments on rectangular mesas provided evidence for radiation frequencies @xmath40 up to four harmonics of @xmath34@xcite , a lower set of modes with harmonic frequencies would be @xmath41 , especially for @xmath42 .",
    "very recent experiments suggested that standing waves along the lengths of rectangular mesas might in fact occur@xcite , although it is presently uncertain if these modes radiate . a possible resolution of this apparent paradox",
    "was recently suggested to arise from the magnetic field component normal to the rectangular length , which was predicted to have a half - wavelength spatial variation across the rectangular width@xcite .    however , this cavity analogy neglects the @xmath1 josephson supercurrent @xmath18 across each of the junctions .",
    "therefore , the second zeroth order model is to treat the mesa as a conducting dipole antenna with an @xmath1 current source , as commonly used in microwave relay stations@xcite . in this picture ,",
    "the most important part of the @xmath1 josephson current is its portion that is uniform across the mesa .",
    "this portion leads to a non - vanishing @xmath22 within the mesa arising from ampre s law .",
    "the important question then , is how to treat the ampre boundary condition .",
    "this has been done in very different ways , with inconsistent results .",
    "bulaevskii and koshelev studied long rectangular mesas , and set the magnetic induction @xmath43 parallel to each edge , with @xmath44 , normal to the substrate@xcite .",
    "they then took @xmath45 at the sample surface , where @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 was imaginary and strongly @xmath49-dependent for @xmath50 .",
    "the same sort of model for the boundary conditions was studied with @xmath51 , a complex constant , by lin and hu@xcite , a frequency - independent constant by lin , hu , and tachiki@xcite , and @xmath52 by tachiki _ et al._@xcite .",
    "hu and lin properly took @xmath53 on the edge of cylindrical mesas , but did not properly take account of the @xmath1 josephson current in the ampre boundary condition@xcite .",
    "_ treated the ampre boundary condition as providing constraints on @xmath43 on opposite sides of the long rectangular mesas in their numerical studies@xcite .",
    "_ treated the @xmath1 josephson current as uniform in the mesa@xcite .",
    "the general problem with this model for the boundary conditions is that a clear understanding of either @xmath54 or @xmath55 was not provided . in the radiation zone , one expects @xmath56 , but at the edge of the sample , @xmath43 is given by the ampre boundary condition , which depends upon the @xmath1 josephson current within the mesa .",
    "thus , the actual situation appears at first sight to be much more complicated than as suggested in those papers .",
    "here we study the simplest and least ambiguous way to treat this boundary condition .",
    "we use love s equivalence principles@xcite , which are variations on huygen s principle , treating the mesa as both an electric conductor and as a magnetic conductor@xcite .",
    "that is , the electric field within the mesa is treated as a surface magnetic current density source @xmath57 by the electric conductor equivalence principle , and the magnetic field inside the mesa is treated as a surface electric current density source @xmath58 , using the magnetic conductor equivalence principle@xcite .",
    "a sketch of a cylindrical mesa with a uniform @xmath59 and a nonuniform @xmath60 corresponding to the @xmath61 cylindrical cavity mode is shown in fig .",
    "1 . this combination of equivalence principles allows us to obtain analytic forms for the angle dependence and polarization of the radiation emitted from cavities suspended in vacuum , while properly accounting for the ampre boundary condition .",
    "( red vertical arrows ) and a magnetic current density @xmath60 ( blue horizontal azimuthal arrows ) .",
    "the @xmath62 signs refer to the signs of the @xmath61 cavity mode , separated by the yellow line , with fixed angle @xmath63 indicated by the thin horizontal black arrow.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig1 ]    as long as rectangular mesas were the only radiation sources under study , it has proved difficult to distinguish the results of these radiation sources@xcite .",
    "clearly , the node ( or soliton kink ) in the center of the mesa assumed by some to be present in the cavity model can not be the ground state of the system@xcite , even dynamically , and inhomogeneous , layer - index - dependent kinks are even higher in energy@xcite , but the extreme non - linear current - voltage characteristic of each mesa allows for chaotic , nonequilibrium effects to be important , so such complications could potentially play important roles in the origin of the radiation .",
    "as noted above , additional rectangular cavity modes might form across the length of the sample@xcite .",
    "the only practical ways to distinguish these models in rectangular mesas is by the observations of the angular dependence of the output power , polarization , and degree of coherence . as indicated previously@xcite",
    ", the antisymmetric cavity model necessarily leads to a maximum in the radiation output power at @xmath64 , directly above the mesa , whereas the conducting dipole antenna model leads to zero radiation power at @xmath64 .",
    "the situation near @xmath65 is much less clear .",
    "the conducting dipole antenna model leads to a substantial output power in that direction , at least in the absence of a superconducting substrate .",
    "however , depending upon the wave vector @xmath13 of the outgoing radiation , emission from the cavity model can lead either to a vanishing or a non - vanishing output at @xmath65 , at least for a non - superconducting substrate .",
    "thus , we considered it important to study a different experimental configuration , in which more substantial differences between the output predictions of these two models would be clearly evident .",
    "it is also crucial to consider the effects of the superconducting substrate .",
    ".table of the first six wave vector parameters @xmath66 for @xmath67 , where @xmath25 defines the rank ordering of the non - vanishing values of @xmath68 , for a cylindrical cavity of radius @xmath69 . [",

    "although a layered superconductor consists of a stack of josephson junctions that in some circumstances may behave rather independently@xcite , in our model , we assume that under the application of a @xmath0 voltage @xmath5 across the @xmath74 layers , all of the layers behave identically .",
    "this assumption was also made by tachiki _",
    "et al._,@xcite , and is consistent with the conclusions of bulaevskii and koshelev @xcite , but is distinctly different from that made by hu and lin@xcite .",
    "for the electric dipole antenna model , the frequencies of the emitted radiation are the same as those present in the @xmath1 josephson current , @xmath75 , since the integer harmonics are generated by the nonlinear @xmath1 josephson effect . for the cavity model",
    ", however , the frequencies @xmath76 of the radiation are the non - vanishing values generated by the @xmath25 zeroes of the first derivative of the @xmath24th regular bessel function @xmath77 , which are far from integer multiples of one another , as evidenced in table i. if a particular cavity mode were to become in resonance with the fundamental @xmath1 josephson frequency @xmath34 , then higher harmonics of the josephson current would not be resonant with any other cylindrical cavity mode . hypothetically , if some cavity modes did not require resonance with the josephson current to radiate , the frequency spectrum of the emitted radiation would be distinctly nonharmonic , as pictured by hu and lin@xcite .",
    "hence , if resonance of the fundamental @xmath1 josephson current frequency with a non - uniform cavity mode were crucial for the radiation to occur , one would not expect to observe any higher harmonics in the output power .",
    "observation of higher harmonics would therefore be _ prima facie _ evidence that a substantial amount of the radiation does not arise from the excitation of cavity modes .",
    "here we calculate the angle and frequency dependence of the output power for both the cavity and electric dipole models for cylindrical and rectangular mesas .",
    "we show that the experiments on cylindrical mesas presented by kadowaki _",
    "_ provide evidence that the radiation at the fundamental @xmath1 josephson frequency , consistent with the @xmath61 cylindrical cavity mode , is a mixture obtained from both the electric and magnetic current sources@xcite . to fit the data quantitatively , we must also take account of the dramatic effects of the superconducting substrate . however , the higher frequencies observed in the measured output power are harmonics of the fundamental , so that any mixing with higher cavity modes is very unlikely . measurements of the angular dependence of the output power , polarization , and coherence of the second harmonic of the emission from cylindrical mesas atop superconducting substrates should therefore be fully coherent , have linear polarization , and vanish at @xmath64 and @xmath78 .",
    "studies of the angular dependence of the power , polarization , and coherence of the emission at the fundamental frequency may help to separate the two radiation sources , as well .",
    "for rectangular mesas , the correct boundary condition of @xmath79 is difficult to impose precisely in a rectangular geometry , due to the corners .",
    "however , with the love equivalence principles , one can find a closed form expression for the far - field radiation , the results of which will be presented , as well .",

    "( [ nuj ] ) .",

    "this @xmath1 josephson current has two essential functions in the radiation .",
    "first , it radiates at all of its harmonic frequencies .",
    "second , the radiation at one of its frequencies may lock onto a cylindrical cavity mode , exciting it , and causing it to radiate , as well .",
    "hence , the @xmath1 josephson current is the primary radiation source .",

    "in this paper , we have presented the first correct prescription of how to incorporate the ampre boundary condition into the superconducting stack of josephson junctions under the application of a @xmath0 voltage @xmath5 , which itself generates thz radiation .",
    "we have used both of the love equivalence principles . by the love equivalence principle for a magnetic conductor , the radiation from the magnetic field inside the mesa generated by the @xmath1 josephson current is effectively set equal to zero inside the cavity , and replaced by the equivalent surface electric current @xmath59 , which is the primary radiation source .",
    "we remark that setting @xmath288 inside the mesa also sets the boundary condition for the cylindrical cavity . with this boundary condition ,",
    "the cylindrical cavity modes are immediately found , and when the @xmath1 josephson current effectively placed on the edge as @xmath59 radiates at a frequency that matches one of the cavity modes , the inhomogeneous part of the @xmath1 josephson current has a mode which resonates with a cavity mode of the same ( or perhaps similar , in an extension of our model ) spatial form , and the amplitude for that cavity mode then grows linearly in time , until it saturates , and then radiates in conjunction with the primary @xmath1 josephson radiation at that frequency",
    ".    the form of the cavity radiation is obtained from love s electric conductor equivalence principle , in which the equivalent of the cavity electric field is placed on the surface as a magnetic surface current density @xmath60 , which radiates in conjunction with the @xmath1 josephson radiation in @xmath59 , the inhomogeneous part of which excited the cavity resonance . from the experiments on three cylindrical mesas ,",
    "we conclude that the lowest energy cavity @xmath61 mode has been excited .",
    "in addition , the harmonic radiation at twice and three times the fundamental frequency can not be explained from the cavity alone , as the mismatch in frequencies is 4% for the second harmonic , and about 3% for the third harmonic .",
    "this harmonic radiation therefore arises almost entirely from the primary radiation source , the @xmath1 josephson radiation acting as a surface electric current density .",
    "in addition , the fact that the superconductor acts both as an electric conductor and as a magnetic conductor provides a mechanism to understand the role of a superconducting bscco substrate . such substrates cause the emitted radiation to vanish along the direction parallel to it , greatly reducing the output power of the radiation .",
    "we remark that while the main function of the inhomogeneous @xmath1 josephson current is that it couples to a cavity mode , provided that the conditions are properly met , if the inhomogeneities are sufficiently strong , they can significantly alter the azimuthal and axial anisotropy of the combined radiation at the fundamental frequency , and especially that of the higher harmonics .",
    "in addition , it remains an open question as to whether the angular constants @xmath143 are fixed or random during the time of the measurement . to the extent that the cylindrical cavity itself is perfectly homogeneous",
    ", one might expect no preferred angle for each mode of inhomogeneity . on the other hand",
    ", some feature involved in the experimental situation might lead to a fixed inhomogeneity direction .",
    "only experiments measuring the angular distribution of the radiation and its polarization can distinguish these two situations .",
    "although we did not show any figures to illustrate this point , if one were to assume the phase of the cavity mode for a fixed @xmath143 could have either sign with equal probability , then the situation would be analogous to our model i for a rectangular mesa .",
    "for a cylindrical cavity , this model would preserve the point kink of the output radiation and restore @xmath236 point group symmetry , but the position of the kink would be at @xmath64 , and the value of the output power would not vanish there .    for rectangular mesas , setting @xmath364 on each of the edges leads to singularities in the analytic properties of the mathematical difficulties at the corners , greatly complicating the situation .",
    "hence , most previous workers studied infinite strips , where the corners could be neglected . for the case of finite length",
    "rectangular mesas , the question of whether the combined radiation is skewed to one side of the mesa or the other is also relevant .",
    "if the mesa were symmetric , as in a cylinder with no preferred angle , one would average over the two configurations , resulting in a symmetric radiation pattern , and an incoherent combination of the radiation from the two sources , each of which is separately coherent .",
    "that was the purpose of our study of models i and ii .",
    "we remark that we have treated the cylindrical mesa essentially as an infinitely thin disk , except in calculating the superconducting substrate factor , completely neglecting any spatial variation normal to the layers .",
    "while this is not a good approximation for treating heating inhomogeneities , it suffices for impurity inhomogeneities and the important lateral inhomogeneities in the @xmath1 josephson current , which we assume to be the critical part of the microscopic mechanism that excites the cavity modes .",
    "hence , exotic features such as inhomogeneous kinks along the @xmath169 axis are omitted entirely , as they are completely unnecessary for the excitation of the cavity modes , but instead complicate the situation unnecessarily@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that cylindrical mesas are much simpler to understand theoretically than are rectangular mesas .",
    "there are several aspects to this simplicity .",
    "most important , the von neumann boundary condition is trivial in this geometry , whereas for a rectangle , it is practically intractable at the corners , except by numerical techniques .",
    "in addition , the fact that none of the cylindrical cavity modes are harmonics of one another is an extremely important point , which is why we set out to study cylindrical mesas in the first place .",
    "since rectangular cavities have higher energy modes that are also harmonics of a lower mode , such as the @xmath35 or the @xmath222 mode , the observation of harmonics in the output of rectangular mesas did not allow for a precise determination of the primary radiation source , which has now been clearly identified as the @xmath1 josephson current , and not the cavity mode radiation .",
    "the primary role of the cavity mode is to lock an @xmath1 josephson mode ( usually , if not always , the fundamental ) onto a well - defined cavity mode , fixing @xmath91 to @xmath365 .",
    "then , the laterally inhomogeneous @xmath1 josephson current excites the @xmath31 cavity mode , allowing it also to radiate . from fits to experimental data on both rectangular and cylindrical cavities , it appears that at least half of the intensity at the angles @xmath366 of maximum output arises from the primary source .",
    "this primary radiation source radiates at all of the @xmath1 josephson harmonic frequencies , and to date , the second harmonic has been observed in emission from all three cylindrical mesas under study , and the third harmonic was visible in two of the three mesas studied .",
    "the amplitudes relative to that of the fundamental of the higher harmonics are comparable to those in rectangular mesas , for which amplification by the excitation of higher cavity modes could occur .",
    "the cavity modes of a cylindrical mesa are similar in form to those of a drum , and one or more of them can be amplified when a drummer strikes a particular spot on the drum surface .",
    "the striking surface region of the drum does not have to have the precise shape of that of the main cylinder ( drum ) mode excited . by analogy",
    ", a modification of our theory of the cylindrical cavity mode amplification could occur without implementation of the von neumann boundary condition to provide a precise matching in spatial form of the cavity mode with that of the inhomogeneities . in a rectangular mesa , a subset of the cavity mode frequencies are harmonics of one another , and can be excited as by a player of a stringed instrument in lightly touching a finger at the midpoint or quarter point at either end of the string , for example , in order to make it sound one or two octaves higher than the fundamental , respectively .",
    "finally , we note that this is the first treatment of the dramatic effect of superconducting substrates upon the output power of radiating bscco mesas .",
    "using the same love principle that was the basis for the correct implementation of ampre s law , the magnetic equivalence principle , we conclude that the superconducting substrates cause a drastic reduction in the output power of the radiation , especially for the power emitted near to @xmath65 .",
    "note that in our predictions for both the primary @xmath1 josephson current and the secondary cavity radiation sources , the output power at the fundamental frequency is predicted to be at least comparable to that at its maximum output .",
    "the fact that in both rectangular and cylindrical mesas , the experimental output at @xmath65 is consistent with zero is a very strong indication that our magnetic conductor model of superconducting substrates is correct .",
    "our model is also consistent with the experiments of barbara _ et al .",
    "_ , in which the output of a josephson junction array with the currents parallel to the superconducting substrate was enhanced by the substrate ( or ground plane ) prior to its entry into the waveguide@xcite .",
    "we reiterate that removal of the superconducting substrate could enhance the output by at least two orders of magnitude , and by replacing the substrate with a perfect electric conductor such as cu , one could further enhance the output by a factor of four .",
    "this could allow for output as high as 5mw , which would be more than sufficient for many practical applications .    in summary",
    ", we have identified the primary microscopic source of the coherent radiation as the @xmath1 josephson current which locks onto a cavity mode , exciting it , and the two modes radiate together at the fundamental @xmath1 josephson frequency .",
    "it suffices to treat all of the junctions as acting in unison . for radiation at the fundamental @xmath1 josephson frequency locked onto the cylindrical cavity @xmath61 mode",
    ", we predict a combined output radiation pattern with linear electric field polarization that is usually along @xmath264 , but not always .",
    "the second harmonic in cylindrical mesas arises almost exclusively from the @xmath1 josephson current , and is also linearly polarized .",
    "the output from rectangular mesas should also be linearly polarized .",
    "we reiterate that removal of the superconducting substrate , or better yet , replacement of it by a perfect electric conductor such as au or cu , could lead to an enhancement of the output power of the mesas from the highest observed power of 5@xmath161 w up to 5 mw , suitable for many applications .",
    "we therefore name this device a josephson star - emitter , for stimulated terahertz amplified radiation emitter .",
    "we thank x. hu , s. lin , b. markovic , n. f. pedersen , and m. tachiki for stimulating discussions .",

    "thus , there are two effects , both of them we assume to be small , of including the full anisotropy of the spatial dependence of the @xmath1 josephson current into the surface electric current density source @xmath59 .",
    "the first is a renormalization of the uniform @xmath98 coefficients to @xmath374 and the second is to introduce azimuthal anisotropy and additional axial anisotropy in the additional terms @xmath375 $ ] .",
    "we note that the renormalization in eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) is a bit spurious , as the term would vanish if the integral were over the full volume of the cylinder , as noted following eq .",
    "( [ deltajform]),at least if the phase factor @xmath376 were absent , but we have placed the current only on the edge , modifying the integral . the second change is more interesting .",
    "it means that output power which is azimuthally anisotropic can arise from inhomogeneities in the @xmath1 josephson current itself , and does not necessarily depend upon the presence of the cavity .",
    "however , we generally assume the @xmath377 , so that the primary effect of these spatial inhomogeneities @xmath99 is to excite a particular cavity mode , as discussed in sec .",
    "iv . nevertheless , as discussed in sec .",
    "vi , the case of @xmath123 is of particular interest , as eq .",

    "another point of some interest is that the @xmath24th contribution to @xmath211 is proportional to @xmath379 .",

    "<S> we calculate the angular dependence of the radiation - zone output power and electric polarization of stimulated terahertz amplified radiation ( star ) emitted from a @xmath0 voltage applied across cylindrical and rectangular stacks of intrinsic josephson junctions . during coherent emission , a spatially uniform @xmath1 josephson current density in the stack acts as a surface electric current density antenna source , leading to an harmonic radiation frequency spectrum , as in experiment , but absent in all cavity models of cylindrical mesas . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that spatial fluctuations of the @xmath1 josephson current cause its fundamental mode to lock onto the lowest finite energy cylindrical cavity mode , causing it to resonate , leading to a non - uniform magnetic surface current density radiation source , and a non - trivial combined fundamental frequency output power with linear polarization for general radiation directions . </S>",
    "<S> this combination of the two coherent sources may be fully or partially coherent . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the higher @xmath1 josephson harmonics to other cylindrical cavity modes is shown to be very weak , at best , and that emission is also linearly polarized . for the more complicated rectangular mesas , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy modes are apparently not excited , but the non - uniform @xmath1 josephson current can excite the harmonic sequence of modes with spatial variation across the rectangular widths , leading to combined radiation output both for the fundamental and the higher harmonics , which combination also may be either fully or partially coherent . we also present a model of the superconducting substrate , in which it acts as a perfect magnetic conductor , greatly reducing the star - emitter power and modifying its angular dependence , especially parallel to the substrate . this model can be tested quantitatively by measurements of the angular dependence of the emitted radiation , especially that of the second harmonic emitted from cylindrical mesas . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative measurements of the amount of coherence could also prove enlightening . based upon this substrate model , </S>",
    "<S> existing bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 crystals atop perfect electric conductors could have star - emitter power in excess of 5 mw , acceptable for many device applications . </S>"
