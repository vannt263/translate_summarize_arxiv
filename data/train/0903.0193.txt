    "spurious two - level system ( tls ) fluctuators are considered a serious source of low - frequency noise in superconducting qubits  @xcite , and the characterization of these fluctuators in solid - state devices has a long history  @xcite .",
    "most recently , coherent coupling between tls fluctuators and a superconducting phase qubit was observed via the novel energy splittings in spectroscopic measurements  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the tls fluctuators have much longer decoherence times than the superconducting qubits , raising the possibility of realizing quantum manipulation on these fluctuators  @xcite .",
    "the key question in manipulating the tls fluctuators is how to implement the required coherent manipulation and readout .",
    "located sparsely inside solid - state devices , the fluctuators usually do not interact with each other , and their states are hard to control .",
    "the coupling between the fluctuators and solid - state devices provides us with a tool to achieve the quantum manipulation  @xcite .",
    "however , conventional gate schems using cavity qed approach that are usually exploited for solid - state qubits can not be applied to this system because of the large energy separation between the fluctuators . in this work",
    ", we will present a gate scheme that exploits the controllability of the superconducting resonator to implement high fidelity gates on the tls fluctuators  @xcite , even when the decay of the resonator is a few megahertz .",
    "the superconducting resonator acts as a knob that controls the dynamics of individual fluctuator , as well as coupling them together . working with practical parameters from the superconducting josephson junction resonator , we will design single - qubit and two - qubit quantum logic gates in the presence of resonator decay .",
    "our scheme takes into account the full coupling hamiltonian between the tls fluctuators and the resonator .",
    "readout of the fluctuators can also be performed by measuring the transmission through the resonator .",
    "this scheme can be extended to fluctuators in different josephson junctions by connecting the junctions into the same superconducting loop due to the nonlocal nature of the microwave mode of the resonator .",
    "this work hence provides a realizable design for coherent manipulation of multiple tls fluctuators , which is closely related to current experimental efforts in studying the fluctuators and their coupling with superconducting resonator modes .",
    "various superconducting resonators in the microwave regime , including superconducting transmission lines , josephson junctions , squid s , and superconducting lumped element resonators , have recently been demonstrated and have shown quantum behavior and strong coupling with superconducting qubits  @xcite .",
    "superconducting resonators are also promising systems for studying quantum effects such as single photon generation and lasing  @xcite , and one of us has shown recently that a josephson junction can be used to probe various properties of tls fluctuators , e.g. to resolve the mechanism that couples the fluctuators to the junction  @xcite . while we will focus on the josephson junction resonator , we want to emphasize that our results can be readily generalized to other superconducting resonators  @xcite .",

    "although the success in implementing universal quantum logic gates makes the tls fluctuators potential candidate for quantum computing , we want to emphasize that the main aim of this work is to provide a practical scheme to demonstrate the coherence behavior of the fluctuators .",
