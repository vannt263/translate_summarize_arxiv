    "<S> the number of ultrahigh energy events at icecube is estimated , for the first time , taking into account non - linear qcd effects in the neutrino - hadron cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the extragalactic neutrino flux is given by @xmath0 and estimate the neutrino - hadron cross section using the dipole approach and a phenomenological model for the dipole - hadron cross section based on non - linear qcd dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the non - linear prediction is able to describe the current icecube data and that the magnitude of the non - linear effects is larger than 20 % for visible energies of order of 2 pev and increases with the neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> our main conclusion is that the non - linear qcd effects are non - negligible and should be taken into account in the analysis of the number of ultrahigh energy events .    </S>",
    "<S> observations in the last years of the neutrino events with deposited energies ranging from 30 to 2000 tev by the icecube observatory @xcite has opened a new era in the neutrino physics , motivating a lot of studies about the production , composition , propagation and detection of neutrino at ultrahigh energies ( for a recent review see , e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main ingredients in these studies is the neutrino - hadron cross section ( @xmath1 ) , which is probed in its high energy behaviour . in our previous studies @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the theoretical uncertainty present in the predictions for @xmath1 associated to the treatment of the qcd dynamics at high energies and demonstrated that the different predictions can differ by a factor 1.5 for neutrino energies around @xmath2 gev and increases to 5.5 for @xmath3 gev . </S>",
    "<S> these results motivate the study of the impact of the qcd dynamics in the predictions of the number of events at icecube , being it the main aim of this letter . as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors have performed a detailed analysis of the standard model expectations , taking into account the theoretical uncertainties associated mainly to the parton distribution functions , which are solution of the _ linear _ qcd dynamics described by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite , our main focus will be to complement that study taking into account _ non - linear _ qcd effects in the calculation of the number of ultrahigh energy neutrino events . as discussed in detail in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a transition from the linear dglap dynamics to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important in the parton cascade and the evolution is given by a non - linear evolution equation @xcite is expected at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to estimate the magnitude of these new dynamical effects in the current energies probed in the icecube observatory and present our predictions for higher energies .    </S>",
    "<S> initially lets present the formalism for the calculation of the number of neutrino events in icecube . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we define the number of events as @xmath4 where @xmath5 days of data - taken , @xmath6 is the solid angle and @xmath7 is the effective number of scatters in the detector , which can be related with the effective volume @xmath8 through the avogadro s number @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 can be written in terms of the effective mass @xmath10 and the effective ice density @xmath11 as given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . as the neutrino </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical sources are too far from earth , all the neutrino flavours are equalized at time they reach the detector due to neutrino oscillations , such that @xmath12 . as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we will assume that the power spectrum @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 with the overall normalization per flavour being given @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross sections are given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the neutrino energy , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the nucleon mass , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the minimum value of @xmath23 which is introduced in order to stay in the deep inelastic region . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath24 gev@xmath25 . our results are almost insensitive to this choice , since the @xmath23 integral is dominated by values of the order of the electroweak boson mass squared . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the differential cross section is given by @xcite    @xmath26\\,\\ , , \\label{difcross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the fermi constant and @xmath28 denotes the mass of the charged or neutral gauge boson . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath1 involves integrations over @xmath29 and @xmath23 , with the integral being dominated by the interaction with partons of lower @xmath29 and @xmath23 values of the order of the electroweak boson mass squared . in </S>",
    "<S> the qcd improved parton model the structure functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are calculated in terms of quark and gluon distribution functions . in this case the neutrino - hadron cross section for charged current interactions on an isoscalar target is given in terms of the parton distribution functions ( see , e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as discussed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in order to estimate the non - linear effects in the qcd dynamics , it is more adequate to describe the structure functions considering the color dipole approach , in which the neutrino - hadron scattering can be viewed as a result of the interaction of a color @xmath32 dipole which the gauge boson fluctuates @xcite . in this approach the @xmath33 structure function is expressed in terms of the transverse and longitudinal structure functions , @xmath34 which are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the transverse size of the dipole , @xmath37 is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a quark and @xmath38 are proportional to the wave functions of the virtual charged or neutral gauge bosons corresponding to their transverse or longitudinal polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for @xmath38 are given , e.g. , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath39 describes the interaction of the color dipole with the target and encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function . as discussed in detail in our previous studies @xcite , perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) </S>",
    "<S> predicts that the small-@xmath29 gluons in a hadron wave function should form a color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite , which is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wave function ( parton saturation ) , with the transition being specified by a typical scale , which is energy dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath40 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have estimated the neutrino - hadron cross section considering the current phenomenological saturation models for @xmath39 and compared with the predictions obtained using the solution of the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite , which describes the cgc evolution in the mean field approximation . in this letter , as our goal is to estimate the magnitude of the non - linear effects in the kinematical region probed by the icecube observatory , we will consider in our analysis the phenomenological saturation model proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , denoted gbw hereafter , which encodes the main properties of the saturation approaches . in the gbw model </S>",
    "<S> the dipole - hadron cross section is parametrized as follows @xmath41,\\ ] ] where the saturation scale is given by @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the value of the bjorken @xmath29 in the beginning of the evolution and @xmath44 is the saturation exponent . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are obtained by fitting the @xmath46 hera data . in our study </S>",
    "<S> we assume the values obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the gbw model was updated in order to describe more recent data . </S>",
    "<S> the linear limit of the gbw model , which is obtained disregarding the non - linear effects , is given by @xmath47 although the linear limit of the gbw model is not able to describe the hera data , a comparison of its predictions with the full model one is illuminating , since allows to directly quantify the contribution of the non - linear effects for a given observable . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility to describe the linear regime using the color dipole approach is to use that in the leading logarithmic approximation the dipole - hadron cross section is directly related to the target gluon distribution @xmath48 as follows ( see , e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : @xmath49 which satisfies the property known as color transparency , i.e. @xmath50 vanishes @xmath51 at small separations . </S>",
    "<S> such approximation is valid at small values of @xmath29 and large values of @xmath23 , which is the region probed in neutrino - hadron interactions at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that @xmath48 is a solution of the dglap evolution equations , the use of this expression as input in our calculations implies that we are disregarding non - linear qcd effects , associated to the high gluon density present at small-@xmath29 ( large energies ) . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the gluon distribution is given by the ct10 parametrization @xcite and that the resulting predictions correspond to the linear qcd dynamics , denoting them by color transp in the plots . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of this model in comparison to the gbw lin one is that the gluon distribution used as input to calculate @xmath50 has been obtained in a global fit of the current experimental data . finally , as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we include in our calculations the contributions associated to the heavy quarks , which contribute significantly at high energies .     </S>",
    "<S> result and the expected background reported by the icecube observatory . </S>",
    "<S> icecube data from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ]        in what follows we present our predictions for the number of neutrino events in the kinematical region probed by the icecube observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the neutrino - hadron cross section considering the models discussed above and use the results as input in the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dn ] ) , which is integrated with respect to the visible energy @xmath52 deposited in icecube detector . considering the initial neutrino flux as described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : flux ] ) , we must take into account all the different possible neutrino reactions that produce signals inside icecube due to this flux keeping in mind that the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath52 is different for each one of these processes . </S>",
    "<S> this is important since the binning is done in the limits of integration in @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation of this procedure is presented in detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which we follow closely . in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:01 ] we present our results for the dependence with @xmath52 of the number of uhe neutrinos seen at icecube as predicted by the integration of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dn ] ) , added with the expected background as reported by icecube collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison we present the prediction obtained using the expression derived in the qcd improved parton model for the structure functions and the ct10 parametrization @xcite for the parton distribution functions , which is similar to the results obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using the mstw parametrization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also present the @xmath53 result and the expected background reported by the icecube observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the gbw model describes quite well the experimental data , with its predictions being very similar to those obtained using the ct10 parametrization . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:02 ] we compare the gbw predictions with those obtained disregarding the non - linear qcd effects , denoted gbwlin and color transp in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that these predictions also are able to describe the data . in comparison to the gbw one </S>",
    "<S> , we have that all predictions are similar to low energies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for higher energies , we obtain that the non - linear prediction is smaller than the linear one . </S>",
    "<S> both behaviours are expected theoretically , since the non - linear effects are predicted to contribute for high values of the parton densities , which should be present at high energies . in order to quantify the contribution of the non - linear effects , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03 ] we present the energy dependence of the ratio between the linear ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and non - linear ( @xmath56 ) predictions for the number of neutrino events at icecube . </S>",
    "<S> we present our predictions for the ratio as a function of the visible energy in the detector . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the ratio increases with the visible energy @xmath52 , which is a direct consequence of the non - linear qcd effects present in gbw model that limits the growth of neutrino - nucleon cross - section at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the non - linear effects is strongly dependent on the model used to describe the linear regime of the qcd dynamics in the color dipole approach . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if we consider the color transp model , we obtain that the contribution of the non - linear effects is @xmath57 for @xmath58 pev , reaching 110 % at @xmath59 pev . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the gbw lin model , the corresponding values are 20 % and 22 % , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the contribution of the non - linear qcd effects is not negligible in the kinematical region probed by the icecube observatory and should be considered as a source of theoretical uncertainty in the analysis of ultrahigh energy neutrino events . </S>",
    "<S> however , a final conclusion about the presence or not of the non - linear effects in the kinematical region probed by icecube still is not possible . in particular , due to the large theoretical uncertainty present in the predictions for high energies obtained using the qcd improved parton model , associated to the uncertainties in the shape of light quark and gluon distributions in the small-@xmath29 and large-@xmath23 regions . as demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the uncertainty band in the predictions for number of neutrino events at icecube associated to the 90 % c. l. range of the parton distribution functions is large , with our gbw prediction being within the band . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> our gbw prediction is very similar to that obtained using the central ct10 values for the parton distribution functions , as demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03 ] , where we present the ratio between the corresponding predictions for the number of neutrino events as a function of the visible energy in the detector . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the discrimination between linear and non - linear qcd dynamics at icecube through the analysis of the number of neutrino events will be a hard task , independently of the presence and magnitude of the non - linear effects .        </S>",
    "<S> finally , lets summarize our results and conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> after the discovery of uhe diffuse astrophysical neutrinos by the icecube observatory , the neutrino astrophysics lives now a new era , with the natural the next steps being the determination of the sources and possible production mechanism that would lead to such neutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to clarify precisely these aspects it is of utmost importance to determine the sources of uncertainties in the calculation of the number of ultrahigh neutrino events . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated , for the first time , this quantity considering non - linear qcd effects , which are expected to contribute for the qcd dynamics at high energies and , consequently , to modify the energy dependence of the neutrino - hadron cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the phenomenological gbw model is able to describe the current icecube data and that the contribution of the non - linear effects is non - negligible at visible energies larger than 2 pev . </S>"
