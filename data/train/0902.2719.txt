    "the quantum groups introduced by drinfeld in @xcite have played a prominent role in various areas of mathematics and physics .",
    "in addition to drinfeld s discovery , woronowicz s axiomatization in @xcite , @xcite of the compact quantum groups has been very influential as well and opened the way for the search of new examples .",
    "in particular it allowed the discovery by wang of the free quantum groups @xcite , which have been subject of several systematic investigations . since then other families of examples have been discovered , building up a fast evolving area :    1 .",
    "the first two quantum groups are @xmath2 , @xmath4 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "these led to a number of general developments , including the study of connections with subfactors , noncommutative geometry and free probability @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and a number of advances in relation with operator algebras @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the third quantum group is @xmath5 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this led to the quite amazing world of quantum permutation groups , heavily investigated in the last few years .",
    "these quantum groups allowed in particular a clarification of the relation with subfactors @xcite , noncommutative geometry @xcite and free probability @xcite .",
    "the fourth quantum group is @xmath6 , recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "this quantum group gave rise as well to a number of new investigations , which are currently under development .",
    "let us mention here the opening world of quantum reflection groups @xcite , and the new formalism of easy quantum groups @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the fifth `` new '' quantum group , namely the half - liberated orthogonal group @xmath0 , constructed in @xcite .",
    "we believe that , as it was the case with its predecessors @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , this quantum group will open up as well a new area : namely , that of the `` root systems '' for the compact quantum groups .",
    "the quantum group @xmath0 is constructed as follows . consider the basic coordinate functions @xmath7 .",
    "these commute with each other , form an orthogonal matrix , and generate the algebra @xmath8 .",
    "wang s algebra @xmath9 is obtained by simply removing the `` commutativity '' assumption . as for obtaining the `` half - liberated '' algebra @xmath10 , the commutativity condition @xmath11 with @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath13 should be replaced by the weaker condition @xmath14 , for @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "summarizing , the quantum group @xmath0 appears via a kind of tricky  ` weakening' of wang s original relations in @xcite .",
    "observe that we have @xmath17 .",
    "one can prove that , under a suitable `` easiness '' assumption , @xmath0 is the only quantum group between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this abstract result , to be proved in this paper , justifies the name `` half - liberated '' , and provides a first motivation for the study of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact @xmath0 was introduced in as one of the 15 easy intermediate quantum groups @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    "we perform a systematic study of @xmath0 , and in particular of its category of representations . after discussing the first features of the definition , we describe in sections  2    4 some @xmath19-spaces of this category in terms of brauer diagrams and",
    "derive two consequences : a connection with the group @xmath3 via the projective version @xmath20 , and the uniqueness result mentionned above .",
    "then we undertake the classification of irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "the main technical novelty is the use of diagonal groups and root systems in a quantum framework .",
    "diagonal groups are meant to be replacements for maximal torii in good situations and are introduced in section  5 . in the case of @xmath0",
    "the diagonal group provides a noncommutative weight lattice which is used in sections  6 and 7 together with a subtle relation to the classical group @xmath3 to classify representations of @xmath0 .",
    "finally we derive in sections  8 , 9 some applications of the classification of irreducible representations to fusion rules , cayley graph and growth .",
    "let us mention here a quite surprising feature of our results : although @xmath0 is an intermediate subgroup between two orthogonal groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 with commutative fusion rules , its fusion rules are noncommutative and its exponent of polynomial growth is the same as for @xmath21 .",
    "this shows also that @xmath0 is not monoidally equivalent , in the sense of @xcite , to any known compact quantum group so far , in particular it is the first original example of a compact quantum group with exponential growth as considered in @xcite .",
    "given a compact group @xmath22 , the algebra of complex continuous functions @xmath23 is a hopf algebra , with comultiplication , counit and antipode given by : @xmath24    consider in particular the orthogonal group @xmath1 .",
    "this is a real algebraic group , and we denote by @xmath25 its basic coordinates , @xmath26 .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 is by definition orthogonal , in the sense that all its entries are self - adjoint , and we have @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , it follows from the stone - weierstrass theorem that the elements @xmath29 generate @xmath8 as a @xmath30-algebra .",
    "these observations lead to the following presentation result .",
    "@xmath8 is the universal unital commutative @xmath30-algebra generated by the entries of an @xmath31 orthogonal matrix @xmath32 .",
    "the maps given by @xmath33 are the comultiplication , counit and antipode of @xmath8 .",
    "the first assertion is a direct application of the classical theorems of stone - weierstrass and gelfand .",
    "the second assertion follows by transposing the usual rules for the matrix multiplication , unit and inversion .",
    "the following key definition is due to wang @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 is the universal unital @xmath30-algebra generated by the entries of an @xmath31 orthogonal matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the maps given by @xmath36 are the comultiplication , counit and antipode of @xmath34 .",
    "it is routine to check that @xmath34 satisfies the general axioms of woronowicz in @xcite .",
    "this tells us that we have the heuristic formula @xmath37 , where @xmath2 is a certain compact quantum group , called free version of @xmath1 .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is known that we have @xmath38 . more generally , the algebra @xmath34 with @xmath39 arbitrary shares many properties with the algebra @xmath40 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the following definition is from the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the half - liberated orthogonal quantum algebra is @xmath41 with comultiplication , counit and antipode coming from those of @xmath34 .",
    "it is routine to check that the comultiplication , counit and antipode of @xmath34 factorize indeed , and that @xmath42 satisfies the general axioms of woronowicz in @xcite .    in order to get some insight into the structure of @xmath42",
    ", we first examine its `` cocommutative version '' .",
    "we have the following analogue of definition  1.3 .",
    "we consider the discrete group @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 are the standard generators of @xmath46 .",
    "observe that we have surjective group morphisms @xmath47 .",
    "as shown in proposition  1.6 below , these morphisms are not isomorphisms in general .",
    "we recall that for any discrete group @xmath48 , the group algebra @xmath49 is a hopf algebra , with comultiplication , counit and antipode given by : @xmath50    the interest in the above group @xmath51 comes from the following result .",
    "we have quotient maps as follows : @xmath52 \\ar[r ] & a_o^*(n ) \\ar[d ] \\ar[r ] & c(o_n ) \\ar[d ] \\\\    c^*({\\mathbb z}_2^{*n } ) \\ar[r ] & c^*(l_n ) \\ar[r ] & c^*({\\mathbb z}_2^n)}\\ ] ]    the vertical maps can be defined indeed by @xmath53 , by using the universal property of the algebras on top .",
    "observe that these maps are indeed hopf algebra morphisms , because the formulae of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 in definition  1.2 reduce to the above cocommutative formulae , after performing the identification @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the group @xmath51 will play an important role in the present paper in relation with the representation theory of @xmath59 .",
    "in particular we will obtain in section 6 an abstract isomorphism @xmath60 .",
    "let us start with a simpler statement that we use for theorem  1.7 .",
    "note that for @xmath61 this already gives @xmath62 .",
    "the groups @xmath51 are as follows :    1 .   at @xmath61",
    "we have @xmath63 .",
    "2 .   at @xmath64",
    ", we have @xmath65 .",
    "we denote by @xmath66 , @xmath67 the standard generators of @xmath68 .",
    "\\(1 ) we know that @xmath69 appears as quotient of @xmath68 by the relations @xmath14 , with @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath70 . in the case @xmath71 or @xmath72",
    "this is a trivial relation ( of type @xmath73 ) , and in the case @xmath74 , @xmath75 we must have @xmath76 , so once again our relation is trivial ( of type @xmath77 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath78 , which gives the result .",
    "\\(2 ) the first assertion is clear , because the equality @xmath79 does nt hold in @xmath46 .",
    "observe now that we have a quotient map @xmath80 , given by @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "this shows that @xmath84 is not abelian .",
    "we deduce that @xmath51 with @xmath64 is not abelian either , so in particular it is not isomorphic to @xmath85 .",
    "the algebras @xmath42 are as follows :    1 .   at @xmath61",
    "we have @xmath86 .",
    "2 .   at @xmath64",
    ", we have @xmath87 .",
    "the three non - equalities in the statement follow from the three non - equalities in proposition  1.6 . in order to prove the remaining statement @xmath88 , consider the fundamental corepresentation of @xmath89 : @xmath90    the elements @xmath32 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 are by definition self - adjoint , and satisfy the relations making @xmath35 unitary .",
    "these unitary relations can be written as follows : @xmath94    with these relations in hand , the verification of the relations of type @xmath14 with @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath95 is routine , and we get @xmath88 .",
    "in this section and in the next one we discuss some basic properties of @xmath42 , by `` interpolating '' between some well - known results regarding @xmath34 and @xmath8 .    for @xmath96 ,",
    "@xmath97 with @xmath98 even we consider the pairings between an upper sequence of @xmath96 points , and a lower sequence of @xmath97 points .",
    "we make the convention that the @xmath98 points of a pairing @xmath99 are counted counterclockwise , starting from bottom left . as an example",
    "we draw hereafter the diagram corresponding to the pairing @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "these pairings , also called brauer diagrams , are taken as usual up to planar isotopy .",

    "@xmath102 : all pairings .",
    "@xmath103 : all pairings with each string having an even number of crossings .",
    "@xmath104 : all pairings having no crossing at all .",
    "the partitions in @xmath104 are familiar objects , also called temperley - lieb diagrams .",
    "observe that the number of crossings for each string of a pairing is invariant under planar isotopy , so the middle set @xmath103 is indeed well - defined .",
    "we make the convention that for @xmath98 odd the above three sets are defined as well , as being equal to @xmath105 .",
    "observe that for any @xmath96 , @xmath97 we have embeddings as follows : @xmath106    for @xmath107 , the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "each string has an even number of crossings ( i.e. @xmath108 ) .",
    "the number of points between the two legs of any string is even .",
    "when labelling the points @xmath109 , each string joins an `` @xmath12 '' to a `` @xmath15 '' .",
    "the equivalence between ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is clear .",
    "now fix a string @xmath110 of @xmath99 and make the following remark : a string @xmath111 crosses @xmath110 * iff * it has exactly @xmath112 end between the two legs of @xmath110 ; otherwise it has @xmath113 or @xmath114 ends between these legs .",
    "this shows the equivalence between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the interest in the brauer diagrams comes from the fact that they encode several key classes of linear maps , according to the following construction .",
    "associated to any partition @xmath107 and any @xmath115 is the linear map @xmath116 given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the standard basis of @xmath119 , and the @xmath120 symbol is defined as follows : @xmath121 if each string of @xmath99 joins a pair of equal indices , and @xmath122 if not .",
    "here are a few examples of such linear maps , which are of certain interest for the considerations to follow : @xmath123    it is known since brauer that the linear maps @xmath124 with @xmath99 ranging over all diagrams in @xmath102 span the tensor category associated to @xmath1 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we have the following results :    1 .",
    "for @xmath8 we have @xmath125 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath42",
    "we have @xmath126 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath34",
    "we have @xmath127 .",
    "the first assertion is brauer s theorem , see section  5.a ) of @xcite .",
    "the third assertion is proved in @xcite , see proposition  2 and the following remarque there .",
    "the middle assertion is theorem  6.9 in @xcite , the idea being as follows .",
    "first , the defining relations @xmath14 express the fact that the following operator must intertwine @xmath128 : @xmath129    the point is that @xmath130 comes from the following brauer diagram :    @xmath131    a careful examination shows that this diagram `` generates '' all the diagrams having an even number of crossings , and this proves the result .    in was pointed out in @xcite that @xmath42 should appear as some kind of `` twist '' of @xmath132 , due to a certain common occurrence of the symmetrized rayleigh law , in the asymptotic representation theory of these algebras . in this paper we will present several results in this sense .",
    "these results will be all based on the following fact .    if @xmath35 , @xmath133 are the fundamental corepresentations of @xmath42 , @xmath132 then @xmath134 for any @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where @xmath135 ( @xmath96 terms ) .",

    "the projective version of a unitary hopf algebra @xmath147 is the subalgebra @xmath148 generated by the entries of @xmath149 , with @xmath149 as fundamental corepresentation .    in the proposition below",
    "are some basic examples , with ( 1 ) justifying the terminology .",
    "recall that @xmath150 , with @xmath48 finitely generated , is a woronowicz algebra with fundamental corepresentation @xmath151 where the @xmath152 are generators of @xmath48 . on the other hand @xmath153 , with @xmath154 compact subgroup , is a woronowicz algebra with fundamental corepresentation @xmath35 given by the embedding into @xmath3 .",
    "we refer finally to @xcite for the definition of the quantum automorphism group @xmath155 .",
    "the projective version is as follows :",
    "1 .   for @xmath156",
    "we have @xmath157 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath158",
    "we have @xmath159 , with @xmath160 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath161 and @xmath162",
    "we have @xmath163 .",
    "the first two assertions are well - known , and follow from definitions .",
    "the third assertion is known as well : for @xmath34 , see corollary  4.1 in @xcite and for @xmath162 , use thorme  1  ( iv ) in @xcite .    in this section",
    "we compute the projective version of @xmath42 .",
    "our starting point is the following simple observation , coming from definitions .",
    "@xmath164 is commutative .",
    "this follows indeed from the relations @xmath14 , because @xmath164 is generated by the elements of type @xmath165 , and we have @xmath166 .",
    "we have @xmath167 .",
    "we will prove that the algebras @xmath42 and @xmath132 have the same projective version . in order to `` compare '' these two algebras ,",
    "we use wang s universal algebra @xmath162 , having both of them as quotients .",
    "consider indeed the following diagram : @xmath168 \\ar[r ] & a^*_o(n ) \\ar[d ] \\\\",
    "c(u_n ) \\ar[r ] & c(o_n)}\\ ] ]    we fix @xmath96 , @xmath169 and we consider the words @xmath170 and @xmath171 . according to the above results , the spaces @xmath172 of our four algebras appear as span of the operators @xmath124 , with @xmath99 belonging to the following four sets of diagrams : @xmath173    summarizing , we have computed the relevant diagrams for the projective versions of our four algebras .",
    "so , let us look now at these projective versions : @xmath174 \\ar[r ] & pa^*_o(n ) \\ar[d ] \\\\      c(pu_n ) \\ar[r ] & c(po_n)}\\ ] ]    we can see that the relationship between @xmath164 and @xmath175 is as follows :    1 .",
    "these two algebras appear as quotients of a same algebra .",
    "the relevant diagrams for these two algebras are the same .",
    "it is a well - known application of woronowicz s results in @xcite that these two conditions ensure the fact that our algebras are isomorphic and we are done .",
    "in this section we find an abstract characterization of the algebra @xmath42 : it is in some sense the unique intermediate quotient @xmath176 .",
    "this will justify the terminology `` half - liberated '' that we use in this paper .    in what follows ,",
    "we use woronowicz s tensor category formalism in @xcite .",
    "that is , we call `` tensor category '' a tensor @xmath30-category with duals whose monoid of objects is @xmath177 , embedded into the tensor @xmath30-category of hilbert spaces .",
    "the following result follows from woronowicz s tannakian duality in @xcite :    the intermediate hopf algebras @xmath178 are in one - to - one correspondence with the tensor categories @xmath179 satisfying @xmath180 where @xmath181 denotes as usual the noncrossing pairings , and @xmath182 , all the pairings .",
    "we have then the following definition , adapted from @xcite .",
    "an intermediate hopf algebra @xmath178 is called `` easy '' when its associated tensor category is of the form @xmath183 for a certain collection of subsets @xmath184 , with @xmath96 , @xmath185 .    in other words , we know from theorem  4.1 that the @xmath19-spaces @xmath186 associated to @xmath187 consist of certain linear combinations of partitions . in the case",
    "where for any @xmath96 , @xmath97 we can exhibit a certain set of partitions @xmath188 such that @xmath186 is spanned by the elements @xmath124 with @xmath189 , we call our hopf algebra `` easy '' .",
    "observe that the sets to be exhibited can be chosen to be : @xmath190    thus , in concrete situations , the check of easiness is in fact straightforward .",
    "we refer to @xcite for full details regarding this notion , including examples and counterexamples .",
    "we use as well the following technical definition .",
    "let @xmath107 be a partition , with its points counted as usual counterclockwise starting from bottom left . for @xmath191",
    "we denote by @xmath192 the partition obtained by connecting with a semicircle the @xmath193-th and @xmath194-th points .    in this definition",
    "we agree of course that the points are counted modulo @xmath98 .",
    "the partitions @xmath192 will be called `` cappings '' of @xmath99 , and will be generically denoted @xmath195 .",

    "we denote by @xmath210 the collection of partitions generated by @xmath99 and by @xmath181 , via the above operations of concatenation and upside - down turning . in particular if @xmath211 we also have @xmath212 for any capping @xmath213 of @xmath214 .",

    "moreover the irreducible corepresentations of @xmath555 , @xmath132 , @xmath175 and @xmath42 that correspond to each other in this picture have the same dimensions : this is clear for the classical groups since restricting or factoring a representation does not change its dimension , and for @xmath42 this results from the proof of theorem  6.2 , where the correspondence between two irreducible corepresentations @xmath337 , @xmath403 of @xmath132 , @xmath42 is defined by the common subspace @xmath556 on which they act .",
    "denote by @xmath558 , @xmath559 , @xmath560 the balls of radius @xmath96 in the cayley graphs of @xmath175 , @xmath555 , @xmath42 , and by @xmath561 , @xmath562 , @xmath563 the growth sequences as above .",
    "we have @xmath564 by propositions  8.4 and  8.5 , hence @xmath565 .",
    "let first @xmath337 be an irreducible representation of @xmath497 , hence also of @xmath21 , such that @xmath568 .",
    "since the fundamental representation @xmath133 of @xmath21 generates its category of representations , we can find a constant @xmath12 depending only on @xmath569 and @xmath570 such that @xmath571 . since @xmath337 is a representation of @xmath497 we must have @xmath572 for some @xmath573 , and we notice that @xmath574 and hence @xmath575 , so @xmath576 .",
    "now take an irreducible representation @xmath577 of @xmath21 with highest weight @xmath511 such that @xmath578 .",
    "then the subobjects @xmath579 have highest weights @xmath580 such that @xmath581 , hence they factor to representations of @xmath497 . since we clearly have @xmath582 , the preceeding discussion shows that @xmath583 .",
    "but for any such @xmath403 we also have @xmath584 .",
    "we have thus proved : @xmath585    from this inclusion it clearly follows @xmath586 .",
    "hence we have alltogether @xmath587 .",
    "since the @xmath542 sequences are growing and @xmath588 has growth exponent @xmath557 , this proves that @xmath589 , @xmath590 are polynomially growing with the same exponent .        to illustrate the proof of theorem  9.2 and the cayley graph computations of section  8 ,",
    "let us draw the cayley graphs of @xmath591 , @xmath592 and @xmath593 in @xmath594 .",
    "these graphs have no multiplicity and no loops , except in the case of @xmath595 where there are @xmath114 loops , that we do not represent , at each vertex different from the origin .",
    "the arrows denote the root system of @xmath596 , and the dots are the images of @xmath597 , @xmath598 , @xmath599 in @xmath594 .      as a conclusion ,",
    "let us remark that the results of this paper and the pictures above seem to hint at the existence of some geometrical data behind compact quantum groups , in the spirit of the classical constructions for semisimple lie algebras .",
    "it is tempting to ask whether the theoretical framework of @xcite for differential calculus on compact quantum groups can give more insight on the nature of the geometrical objects involved .",
    "however this seems to be a very challenging question , and other intermediate examples between the classical world and the free world of compact quantum groups might be needed first ."
