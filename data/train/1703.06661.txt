    "debris disks are optically thin circumstellar dust components around main - sequence stars , and are crucial to our understanding of the formation of planetary bodies , such as planets , comets , and asteroids .",
    "debris disks stand between gas - rich protoplanetary disks and mature planetary systems , and their investigation sheds light on the late stages of planet formation . almost all the gas in debris disks is thought to have dissipated , and dust grains smaller than @xmath11 m are therefore expected to be quickly blown out by stellar radiation pressure from the central star ( especially at @xmath12@xmath13 ) ( e.g. , wyatt 2008 ) .",
    "however , recent observational studies at infrared wavelengths have shown that such small grains survive in debris disks ( e.g. , ishihara et al .",
    "one possible mechanism by which small grains remain for a long time is that the gas component remains in debris disks to a moderate extent .",
    "several debris disks harboring a gas component have been discovered in survey observations at optical , infrared , and radio wavelengths .",
    "the gas components around @xmath3 pictoris and hd  32297 were first detected via ca ii and na i absorption lines ( slettebak 1975 ; hobbs et al .",
    "1985 ; redfield 2007 ) . for hd  172555 , @xmath14 tel , and au mic ,",
    "the gas component was identified from [ o i ] , [ c ii ] , and fluorescent h@xmath10 emissions , respectively ( france et al . 2007 ; riviere - marichalar et al . 2012 , 2014 ) . [",
    "o i ] and [ c ii ] emissions were also detected for @xmath3 pictoris ( brandeker et al .",
    "some debris disks are known to have submillimeter - wave co emission ; e.g. , 49 ceti ( dent et al . 2005 ; hughes et al .",
    "2008 ) , @xmath3 pictoris ( fernndez et al . 2006 ; dent et al .",
    "2014 ) , hd  21997 ( mor et al . 2011 . 2013 ; kspl et al .",
    "2013 ) , hd  131835 ( mor et al .",
    "2015 ) , and hd  141569 ( white et al . 2016 ) .    why debris disks can possess a gas component",
    "is not well understood .",
    "one possibility is that such gas has a primordial origin ; i.e. , the gas is the remnants of a protoplanetary gas disk .",
    "the other possibility is that the gas has a secondary origin , for which several different mechanisms can be considered ; e.g. , the sublimation of dust grains ( kobayashi et al . 2011 ) or planetesimals ( lagrange et al . 1998 ) , photo - sputtering of dust grains ( grigorieva et al . 2007 ) , collisional vaporization of dust grains ( czechowski @xmath15 mann 2007 ) , and collision of comets or icy planetesimals ( zuckerman @xmath15 song 2012 ) .",
    "such secondary gas is thought to be mainly composed of co and h@xmath10o ( mumma @xmath15 charnley 2011 ) , while only a small amount of h@xmath10 is expected .",
    "the present study proposes a new approach to tackle the origin of the gas in debris disks using the submillimeter - wave fine - structure line of atomic carbon , [ c i ] .",
    "debris disks can generally be regarded as a photodissociation region ( pdr ; e.g. , tielens @xmath15 hollenbach 1985 ) as shown by the detection of [ o i ] and [ c ii ] ( e.g. , brandeker et al .",
    "2016 ) . in the pdr ,",
    "the abundance of atomic carbon ( c ) is determined by the balance among the photodissociation of co , photoionization of c , electron recombination of c@xmath16 , and reactions between c@xmath16 and h@xmath10 , and it is thus sensitive to both the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field and h@xmath10 density as well as metallicity .",
    "the [ c i ] line has therefore been widely used to diagnose molecular clouds ( e.g. , ikeda et al .",
    "1999 ; shimajiri et al .",
    "2013 ; krips et al . 2016 ) .",
    "this method could be applied to debris disks .",
    "although [ c ii ] and co emissions have been observed in a few debris disks , no detection of [ c i ] emission has been reported . with this in mind , we conducted sensitive observations of [ c i ] emission toward two representative gaseous debris disks ; i.e. , those of 49 ceti and @xmath3 pictoris .",
    "we observed the [ c i ] @xmath0_p_@xmath1@xmath0_p_@xmath2 ( 492.161  ghz ) and co(@xmath4=32 ) ( 345.796  ghz ) lines toward 49 ceti and @xmath3  pic ( see table 1 ) from september to october 2016 with the 10  m telescope of the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) .",

    "emission has a double - peak profile , suggesting that atomic carbon extends mainly to the outermost part of the disk .",
    "note that the [ c i ] emission is fainter than the co emission in both cases , although the observed transition of co is different from ours . the [ c i]/co(@xmath4=43 ) integrated intensity ratio toward dm tau has been reported to be 0.9 ( tsukagoshi et al . 2015 ) , while the [ c i]/co(@xmath4=65 ) ratio is between 0.05 and 0.3 ( kama et al .",

    "in contrast to the case for protoplanetary disks , extensive [ c i ] observations have been made toward molecular clouds . in the orion a molecular cloud , the [ c i]/co(@xmath4=32 )",
    "integrated intensity ratios range from 0.1 in the orion kl region to 1.2 at the southern end ( ikeda et al .",

    "the c / co column density ratio is derived to be 54@xmath519 and 69@xmath542 for 49  ceti and @xmath3 pictoris , respectively , where the errors quoted include the rms noise of the spectra and the uncertainty due to the assumed range of the excitation temperature .",
    "although the c / co column density ratio has not been derived for the protoplanetary disks , it would be lower than the above ratios in the debris disks , owing to the lower [ c i]/co intensity ratio .",
    "we next compare the ratios with those reported for molecular clouds ( e.g. , orion and w3 ) and diffuse clouds .",
    "the c / co column density ratio ranges from 0.2 to 2.5 .",

    "the average ratio is 1.2 in molecular clouds at high galactic latitude ( ingalls et al .",
    "the ratio has also been reported to be from 0.2 to 1.1 in mcld  123.5 + 24.9 ( bensch et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the ratio is higher in diffuse clouds than in the interior of molecular clouds owing to photodissociation by uv radiation . in comparison with the c / co ratios observed for molecular clouds and diffuse clouds , the c / co ratio is unusually high for 49  ceti and @xmath3 pictoris .",
    "we now discuss why the c / co ratio is an order of magnitude higher than the ratios for diffuse clouds and molecular clouds .",
    "because the visual extinction , @xmath43 , in the debris disks is estimated to be 0.01 or lower , the debris disks can be regarded as pdrs . as for the uv radiation source",
    ", we have to consider radiation from the central star in addition to interstellar uv radiation .",
    "because we focus on the photodissociation of co and the photoionization of c , we only consider far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons ( 11 @xmath24 @xmath44 @xmath24 13.6  ev ) in our discussion . hence",
    ", the ratio of the fuv photon density relative to that for the standard interstellar condition , which is denoted @xmath45 , is used to define the uv strength ( drain @xmath15 bertoldi 1996 ) . the @xmath45 value at 50  au is evaluated to be 10 for 49 ceti and 1 for @xmath3 pictoris .    in pdrs , the main destruction process of co is photodissociation , having a time scale of @xmath46100  yr .",
    "we note that , if co is continuously destroyed in the debris disk and never reproduced , co has to be supplied by planetesimal collisions or other mechanisms with a continuous rate of @xmath47  kg  yr@xmath20 ( dent et al .",
    "it seems controversial whether this production rate is realistic during the debris disk phase .",
    "meanwhile , co can be reproduced by the chemical reactions shown in figure 3 .",
    "although this figure presents a simplified network of the production and destruction of co , it is apparent that h@xmath48 is essential for the reproduction of co. the h@xmath48 number density , [ h@xmath48 ] , is thus an important factor controlling the c / co ratio .",
    "we roughly estimated the number density of atomic carbon from @xmath33(c ) to be @xmath46@xmath50  cm@xmath37 by assuming a disk size of @xmath4650  au . because co is a minor gas component in debris disks , most carbon in the gas phase is c@xmath52 and c owing to photodissociation and photoionization .",
    "hence , the h@xmath10 density could be as high as @xmath53  cm@xmath37 , if the abundance of co relative to h@xmath48 in interstellar clouds ( @xmath46@xmath54 ) is applied to the abundance of atomic carbon .",
    "pdr models have extensively been applied for molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , tielens @xmath15 hollenbach 1985 ; warin et al .",
    "1996 ; rolling et al .",
    "however , pdr models for debris disks have not been reported to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we thus conducted a chemical model calculation using the simplified toy model ( figure 3 ) . for h@xmath48 density of @xmath53 cm@xmath37 and @xmath45 of 1 , the c / co ratio is close to unity .",
    "however , co production becomes less efficient if the carbon abundance relative to h@xmath48 is higher ( i.e. , there is less h@xmath48 ) .",
    "we found that the c / co ratio can be 70 and 900 for [ h@xmath10]/[c@xmath56 ratios of 70 and 7 , respectively , where [ c@xmath56 is the total number density of c@xmath16 , c , and all carbon - bearing molecules . in these calculations , we used the rate coefficients tabulated in the umist database for astrochemistry ( mcelroy et al .",
    "although the chemical model is preliminary , the observed high c / co ratio suggests a low [ h@xmath10]/[c@xmath56 ratio .",

    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the number of h@xmath10 molecules in the debris disks could be small , because the co gas in the debris disk is not always of interstellar origin .",

    "<S> we have detected [ c i ] @xmath0_p_@xmath1@xmath0_p_@xmath2 emissions in the gaseous debris disks of 49 ceti and @xmath3 pictoris with the 10  m telescope of the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment , which is the first detection of such emissions . </S>",
    "<S> the line profiles of [ c i ] are found to resemble those of co(@xmath4=32 ) observed with the same telescope and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that atomic carbon ( c ) coexists with co in the debris disks , and is likely formed by the photodissociation of co. assuming an optically thin [ c i ] emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100  k , the column density of c is evaluated to be ( 2.2@xmath50.2)@xmath610@xmath7 and ( 2.5@xmath50.7)@xmath610@xmath8  @xmath9 for 49 ceti and @xmath3 pictoris , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the c / co column density ratio is thus derived to be 54@xmath519 and 69@xmath542 for 49 ceti and @xmath3 pictoris , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and diffuse clouds by an order of magnitude </S>",
    "<S> . the unusually high ratios of c to co are likely attributed to a lack of h@xmath10 molecules needed to reproduce co molecules efficiently from c. this result implies a small number of h@xmath10 molecules in the gas disk ; i.e. , there is an appreciable contribution of secondary gas from dust grains . </S>"
