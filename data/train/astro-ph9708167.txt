    "in the unified model of seyfert galaxies ( antonucci @xcite ) , the observed differences between seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies are explained as an orientation effect .",
    "all seyfert galaxies are suggested to be intrinsically the same type of object , having a central , accreting , massive black hole , around which there is a luminous disk and hot gas .",
    "a molecular torus surrounds the central x - ray source , obscuring it for edge - on viewing , but not for face - on viewing within the opening angle of the torus .",
    "seyfert galaxies viewed from an angle at which the central region is directly visible are classified as seyfert 1 , and when the central region is obscured , they are classified as seyfert 2 .",
    "the model is based on the observations of polarized broad lines in the optical spectra of several seyfert 2 galaxies ( see , e.g. , antonucci & miller @xcite ) and the presence of strong absorption in the x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies , indicating a molecular torus ( e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "some seyfert 2 galaxies have been observed to have an intrinsic spectrum which is flatter than has been observed for seyfert 1 galaxies ( smith & done @xcite , cappi et al .",
    "this contradicts the unified model , which predicts the same average intrinsic photon index for seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "however , observations with a single satellite are usually limited to a fairly narrow spectral range , e.g. , @xmath12 kev for _",
    "asca_. if the radiation from the object undergoes extensive absorption , this range may be too narrow to make it possible to determine whether the intrinsic spectrum is really flat or whether it is intrinsically steep and maybe affected by a complex absorber and/or compton reflection . by combining data from two or more satellites , one can broaden the spectral coverage and reduce these uncertainties . in this paper",

    "we continue by studying the sis data by fitting the sis0 and the sis1 spectra individually .    using model r , with a free reflection parameter ,",

    "the large uncertainty in the partial absorber is due to the fact that it is effective only for a narrow energy interval at high energies and therefore only a few data points can constrain the values .",
    "this model is of the same quality as the reflection model , and one can not tell from the data which is the better one . a more complicated model , using a power law and a dual absorber as well as compton reflection , does not increase the quality of the fit",
    ".      the sis data can constrain models r and t better than the gis data . however , due to the uncertainties in the reduction , where the sis data are sensitive to the screening criteria and give different results depending on the criteria adopted , we rely more on the gis results .",
    "the sis0 and the sis1 detectors also give results that differ from each other , while the gis data are more consistent with each other and are usually less sensitive to details in the reduction . in the subsequent investigation ,",
    "we therefore use only the gis2 and the gis3 data for the _ asca _ observation .",
    "the errors in the gis flux can be found by varying the model parameters to map out the confidence region .",

    "we begin by trying to add a compton reflection component . by adding the reflection parameter @xmath31 , the @xmath64 of the resulting fit",
    "is reduced by only @xmath177 units .",
    "furthermore , the data can not properly constrain the @xmath31 parameter . at a 68 @xmath28 confidence level @xmath31",

    "continuing with model t one finds a fit with a power law , @xmath179 with @xmath180 kev and @xmath181 @xmath2 . here too , the data have difficulty in constraining the model . at a 68 @xmath28 confidence level",
    "the best fit has @xmath182 @xmath2 and @xmath183 .",

    "@xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) . neither the reflection model nor the transmission model is therefore preferred by the data over the power law model , and thus the osse data do not alter , or at least do not contradict , the conclusion from using the _ asca _ data alone , i.e. , that the x - ray spectrum of ngc 7172 has become flatter between 1989 and 1995 .",
    "the conclusion of the tests to prove the flatness of the spectrum found by the gis data alone , can , however , only be tentative , due to the spectral and normalization variations in the osse band in the short time scales , observed . with the available data , and bearing in mind the problems connected with non - simultaneous studies , we present the results from model p , using gis data from the _ asca _ observation and the vp 413.0 data from the _ cgro _ osse observation , gis / osse(vp  413 ) , as the finally most interesting ones ( fig . 5 . ) .",

    "the figure shows that the e - folding energy is not as tightly constrained to low energies , as the single parameter interval suggests , but it is obviously bounded upwards .",
    "the _ asca _ data below @xmath186 kev are not used in the modelling .",
    "it is , however , evident that a soft ( @xmath57 kev ) component exists , which is often seen in seyfert 2 galaxies ( morse et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the power of this soft component is about a factor of @xmath187 lower than the peak power of the source .",

    "it probably originates from a parsec sized region far away from the nuclear source .",
    "it may be due to scattered nuclear light or thermal bremsstrahlung .    for comparison , we also study the combined _ asca_/osse(vp 413 ) spectrum using the sis0 data instead , which is the least conspicuous of the sis observations as compared to the gis .",
    "the resulting fit confirms the low e - folding energy , @xmath190 and the flat power law @xmath191 .",
    "we now turn over to the _ ginga _ data and combine it with the osse data , noting that several years separate these two observations , which demands even more caution to be taken , in interpreting the non - simultaneous fits . in the first fit , using the osse data from viewing period 411.5 the normalization of the osse data are only 10 @xmath28 higher than the _ ginga _ data .",
    "there is no cut - off at high energies .",
    "the best fit has @xmath61d.o.f .",

    "the next two fits include the osse data from viewing period 412.0 and 413.0 .",
    "the photon index of the power law is dictated by the high quality _ ginga _ data , @xmath195 .",
    "the free normalization shows that the _ ginga _ data is 50 @xmath28 higher and 60 @xmath28 lower , respectively .",
    "for these two periods , the e - folding energies are low , even with the steeper spectrum given by the _ ginga",
    "_ data . they are not constrained upwards , with 90 @xmath28 lower limits of 95 and 120 kev , respectively .      finally , we analyse all three data sets together .",
    "it is evident from an inspection of the data that there is a difference in the normalization between the 1995 _ asca _ and the 1989 _ ginga _ data , and we allow the _ ginga _ data to have variable normalization relative to the _ asca _ and osse data sets . from inspection of the residuals of the different instruments , it is clear that the high quality _ ginga _ data that defines the fit , and leaving the asca data poorly fit .",
    "this supports earlier findings , that ngc 7172 had a different spectral shape and absorber in 1989 than in 1995 and we do not make any further analysis using data from all three satellites at the same time .",
    "using the _ asca _ gis observations of ngc 7172 , the best fit for a power law and a single absorber ( model p ) gives a flat spectrum with @xmath196 .",
    "adding the _ cgro _ osse data , a broader band spectrum is achieved , which could constrain the spectral parameters better .",
    "the gis / osse observations of ngc 7172 were , however , not simultaneous .",
    "the time interval between the observations was only two months and the source did not show any evidence of variability during the _ asca _ observation . furthermore , the flux variation over the period 19851995 was quite modest .",
    "on the other hand , the osse observations showed considerable spectral variations during the month it was observed .",
    "in addition , the _ asca _ data from the may 1996 observation ( matt et  al .",
    "@xcite ) show a decrease in @xmath68 kev flux , down to @xmath197 erg @xmath2 s@xmath6 .",
    "this emphasises the difficulty of combining non - simultaneous observations , which should be studied using great caution .",
    "very few broad - band studies have been done and as they are of great physical interest , it is useful to study even non - simultaneous data sets , taking into account the uncertainties that infallibly accompanies the study .    the combined data from march and may 1995 are consistent with the spectrum of ngc 7172 being as flat as observed with the _ asca _ satellite alone .",
    "the osse data show a rather sharp cut - off at @xmath198 kev , and it is relatively well constrained .",
    "the fits do not improve when more complicated models are used , such as adding an fe line , a reflection component , or using a dual absorber model .",
    "the flat spectrum found means that the spectral index of ngc 7172 is variable , changing from @xmath199 in 1989 to @xmath200 in 1995 .",
    "it still lies within the range that seyfert 1 galaxies are observed to have .",
    "we note that some other seyfert galaxies ( see , e.g. , yaqoob @xcite and references therein ) , most notably ngc 4151 ( yaqoob & warwick @xcite , zdziarski et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , also have variable @xmath74 . furthermore , both _ ginga _",
    "( smith & done @xcite ) as well as _ asca _ ( e.g. cappi et  al .",
    "@xcite , weaver et  al .",
    "@xcite ) observations show that some seyfert 2 galaxies have flat spectra similar to that sometimes shown by ngc4151 . in a large fraction of these sources with",
    "flat spectra , reflection is not needed in the fits , and thus the intrinsic spectrum could be flat .",
    "zdziarski et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) discussed in detail the theoretical implications of the flat intrinsic spectrum and weak reflection of ngc 4151 .",
    "similar arguments also apply to ngc 7172 .",
    "a flat intrinsic spectrum implies that the x/@xmath30 source is soft - photon starved .",
    "this , in turn , requires that any cold matter reprocessing the x/@xmath30 radiation into soft uv - photons must subtend a small solid angle as viewed from the x/@xmath30 source , and/or that the x/@xmath30 source subtends a small solid angle as viewed from the cold matter .",
    "weak reflection , furthermore , requires similarly that the cold matter subtends a small angle as viewed from the x/@xmath30 source , or , if the cold matter has a disk geometry , that the disk is viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "several geometries are consistent with these requirements , for instance , a hot inner disk and a cold outer disk ( shapiro et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , or edge - on view of a cold disk with hot sources elevated above the disk ( e.g. , svensson @xcite ) .",
    "the varying spectral slope can then be due to a change in geometry , such as changing the interface radius between the inner hot and the outer cold disk , or changing the elevations of the hot sources above the cold disk .",
    "as we are likely to view the central source in seyfert 2 galaxies more or less edge - on , anisotropic spectral effects are a less likely source of spectral variability ( stern et  al .",
    "@xcite , poutanen et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the other hand , a reflection model or a transmission model with a photon index , @xmath201 , can not be ruled out completely .",
    "the fits are , however , not significantly better . in the case of the dual absorber ,",
    "the geometry of the absorbing gas components with covering fraction @xmath202 over scales of @xmath203 cm ( i.e. , the scale of the central x - ray source ) is not obvious .",
    "it is of interest to compare our results with previous efforts to fit broad band spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "ngc 4945 ( done et  al .",
    "@xcite ) shows a steep intrinsic spectrum with @xmath204 and a very large absorber , @xmath205 @xmath2 .",
    "the e - folding energy is not well constrained at @xmath206 kev .",
    "our results for ngc 7172 are more consistent with the average broad band spectrum of the three seyfert 2 galaxies , ngc 4507 , ngc 7582 , and mcg-523 - 16 ( zdziarski et  al .",
    "@xcite ) which displays a flatter spectrum with @xmath207 and an e - folding energy at @xmath208 kev .",
    "according to the _ asca _ observations from 1995 and 1996 , the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7172 exhibits a flat spectrum , @xmath209 , unlike the typical seyfert 1 galaxies , thus posing a problem for the current theory of the seyfert unification scheme , which predicts the same average intrinsic photon index for seyfert 2 galaxies and seyfert 1 galaxies , i.e. , a mean value of @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , the 1989 observation by _ ginga _ , with its broader spectral range , showed a spectral slope , @xmath199 , similar to that of seyfert 1 galaxies . by combining the _ asca _ and the _ cgro _ osse data , both from 1995 , a broad band spectral fit is possible , which better determines the effects of a possible complex absorber and of compton reflection , which may be undetectable using the _ asca _ data alone .",
    "the data are , however , non - simultaneous and the final results should therefore be treated with appropriate caution .",
    "we find that the simplest model , consisting of an absorbed power law with an exponential high energy cut - off , gives an acceptable description of the data .",
    "the fit does not change significantly as compared to the results obtained by analysing only the _ asca _ data .",
    "the spectral index of the power law has thus become flatter since the _ ginga _ observations in 1989 and the change in spectral slope , @xmath210 , could be an intrinsic change .",
    "the value obtained for the photon index still lies at the lower end of the range observed for seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the spectrum is observed to cut - off at about 150 kev , using the _ cgro _ osse viewing period with the highest quality data .",
    "we also find that the _ cgro _ osse spectral shape appears to vary on a time scale of weeks .",
