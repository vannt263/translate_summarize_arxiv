    "density matrix_. for physical analysis _",
    "amplitudes _ are much more convenient .",
    "we present here a new type of amplitude analysis  extraction of largest eigenvalue of density matrix .",
    "density matrix can be represented by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors : @xmath22 single out leading term : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is coherent part of density matrix and @xmath25 is the rest ( incoherent part ) . to be of physical meaning , this decomposition must be _ stable _ with respect to variations of density matrix elements .",
    "this is so if eigenvalues are _ well separated _ in comparison with errors in @xmath26 matrix : @xmath27 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "extraction of largest eigenvalue has the following advantages . by construction matrix @xmath24",
    "has rank one , so phases are well defined .",
    "it quantitatively uses information about coherence factors , which is often ignored .",
    "practical experience shows that resonance structures tend to concentrate in @xmath24 and leakage ( see below ) is suppressed in @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath25 can contain different non - leading exchanges , albeit it often contains garbage .",
    "we can also note that if the wave is small in @xmath24 , its phase with respect to largest waves can not be measured .    as a restriction this method requires a lot of data for good fit with small errors .",
    "it is not applicable if eigenvalues are not separated . in this case sometimes a group of clustered eigenvalues can be extracted .",
    "it is also not applicable if all eigenvalues except one are not statistically significant , as it is the case for unnatural sector for @xmath28 system .",
    "an example of separation of largest eigenvalue is present in figure  [ fig - lev ] . on sub - figures a ) and",

    "it was already noted @xcite that at low @xmath5 region this wave is large and highly incoherent with others at @xmath32  @xmath7 and have only a relatively small shoulder at @xmath33  @xmath7 , which corresponds to well known @xmath34 .",
    "our analysis confirms this as shown in figure  [ fig - lev ]  a ) .",
    "contrary to this in the largest eigenvalue this wave is dominated by physical @xmath34 .",
    "the bump at low @xmath35 is at least ten times suppressed , which is consistent with its low coherence with other waves .",
    "the physical nature of this phenomena is still unknown . in figures  [ fig - lev ]",
    "c ) ,  d ) one can see the difference between full density matrix and largest eigenvalue for the wave @xmath21 at @xmath20  @xmath12 . at both figures we can see at @xmath36  @xmath7 a signal for @xmath37 while in fig.[fig - lev ]",
    "c ) we can also see a bump at @xmath38  @xmath7 which is absent in fig.[fig - lev ]  d ) .",

    "we have used the following method to study a possible leakage effects due to finite setup resolution and limited knowledge of setup acceptance . at first",
    ", we fit real data with small but representative wave set  12 largest waves .",
    "the result of this step is a reasonably accurate representation of multidimensional distribution of real events .",
    "next we generate monte - carlo events according to density matrix from this fit , smear these events according to modeled setup resolution and fit them as usual using standard wave set with all 42 waves . to study dependence of results of variation of modeled acceptance ,",
    "we have used monte - carlo events without smearing , but used corrupted mc program ( with hodoscope trigger logic excluded ) for final fits with 42 waves .",

    "the bins over @xmath5 are selected so that numbers of events in @xmath39 peak are approximately the same for all bins , namely about 20000  events/50  mev , so @xmath5 distribution for coherent part of exotic wave is roughly the same as for @xmath39 while its crossection is only 23% of it .",
