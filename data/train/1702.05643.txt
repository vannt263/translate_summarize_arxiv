    "another source of symplectic geometry , equally important but maybe not so well known , are the works on optics due to pierre de fermat ( 16011665 ) , christian huygens ( 16291695 ) , tienne - louis malus ( 17751812 ) , charles franois dupin ( 17841873 ) and william rowan hamilton ( 18051865 ) .",
    "i will deal mainly in what follows with the malus - dupin theorem in geometrical optics , according to which a family of light rays smoothly depending on two parameters which , when entering an optical system , has a property called _ _ rectangularity _ _ , keeps that property in each transparent medium in which it propagates .",

    "luminous phenomena are described in terms of _ light rays_. in classical ( non - relativistic ) physics , the physical space in which we live and in which light propagates is mathematically described as an affine three - dimensional space @xmath0 endowed , once a unit of length has been chosen , with an euclidean structure .",
    "the set of all oriented straight lines in @xmath0 will be denoted by @xmath1 . in an homogeneous and isotropic transparent medium ,",

    "a reflection on a mirror mathematically described as a smooth surface , or a refraction acroos a smooth surface which separates two transparent media with different refractive indices , are therefore described as _",

    "similarly , the family of rays emitted in an homogeneous and isotropic transparent medium by a smooth luminous surface , when each point of that surface emits only one ray in a direction orthogonal to the surface , is rectangular : it is indeed a well known geometric promerty of the family of straight lines orthogonal to a smooth surface .",

    "then i will present another proof founded in symplectic geometry .",
    "tienne louis malus de mitry ( 17751812 ) was a soldier in the french army , a mathematician and a physicist .",
    "he studied the properties of families of oriented straight lines in view of applications in optics .",
    "moreover , he developed the undulatory theory of light due to christian huygens ( 16291695 ) , discovered and studied the phenomena of _ light polarization _ and of _ birefringence _ which occurs when light propagates in some crystals .",
    "he was engaged in the disastrous military campaign launched by napolon in egypt ( 17981801 ) . in egypt",
    "he fell ill of a terrible disease , the plague , and was miraculously cured . in 1811",
    "he became director of studies at the french cole polytechnique .",
    "weakened by the diseases caught in egypt , he died of tuberculosis in 1812 . during the egypt campaign he kept a journal which was published eighty years after his death @xcite .",
    "malus proved @xcite that the family of rays emitted by a luminous point ( which , as seen above , is rectangular ) still is rectangular after _ one reflection _ on a smooth mirror or _",
    "one refraction _ across a smooth surface .",
    "but he was in doubt whether this property is still satisfied for _ several _ successive reflections or refractions @xcite .",
    "malus works on families of oriented straight lines were later used and much extended by hamilton @xcite .",
    "charles franois dupin ( 17841873 ) was a french naval engineer and mathematician .",
    "his name is linked to several mathematical objects : _ dupin s cyclids _ , remarkable surfaces he discovered when he was a youg student of gaspard monge ( 17461818 ) at the french cole polytechnique ; _ dupin s indicatrix _ which describes the shape of a smooth surface near one of its point .",
    "i think that arnold s theorem stated in the footnote below does not apply to these objects , which are indeed due to dupin .",
    "he spent several years in corfu ( greece ) where he renovated the naval dockyard , while participating in the creation , then in the works of the ionian academy .",
    "he became professor at the french _ conservatoire des arts et mtiers _",
    ", where he lectured and wrote several books for the education of working classes .",
    "he had very modern ideas : he thought that young girls should receive as good an education as youg boys and believed that a general increase of the education level would have beneficial effects on the whole society . unfortunately these generous ideas are still not everywhere in application in today s world .",
    "he was exceptionnally shrewd : according to wikipedia @xcite , he inspired the poet and novelist _",
    "edgar allan poe _",
    "( 18091849 ) the character of _ auguste dupin _ appearing in the three detective stories _ the murders in the rue morgue _ ,",
    "_ the mystery of marie roget _ and _ the purloined letter_. he found a very neat geometric proof of the malus - dupin theorem for reflections @xcite and he knew that the same result was true for refractions but did not publish his proof .    according to @xcite , adolphe quetelet ( 17961874 ) and joseph diaz gergonne ( 17711859 ) obtained in 1825 a proof of the malus - dupin theorem both for reflections and for refractions .",
    "a little later , the great irish mathematician william rowan hamilton ( 18051865 ) independently obtained a complete proof of that theorem @xcite .",
    "he knew the previous works of malus on the subject and quoted them in his own works , but it seems that he did not knew the works of dupin , quetelet and gergonne .",
    "maybe this explains why that theorem , called in french textbooks on optics the _ malus - dupin theorem _",
    "@xcite , is generally called _",
    "malus theorem _ in other countries .",
    "i present in this section hamilton s proof of the malus - dupin theorem ( @xcite ) , first for a reflection , then for a refraction .",
    "while scrupulously following hamilton s ideas , i use today s vector notations in use in mathematics and physics .",
    "moreover i use figures to illustrate hamilton s reasoning , although there are none in his publications  .",
    "hamilton considers a two - parameters family @xmath4 of rays reflected by a smooth surface @xmath23 .",
    "he assumes that each ray in @xmath4 meets @xmath23 transversally .",
    "his arguments are local since they apply to a small neighbourhood of each ray in @xmath4 .",
    "he proves successively three results .",
    "first , he proves that if the reflected family of rays is focused to a single point , the incident family @xmath4 is rectangular .",
    "then he proves that if the incident family @xmath4 is rectangular , for each ray in @xmath4 one can choose the position and the shape of a smooth mirror in such a way that by reflection that ray and all rays in a a small neighbourhood of it are focused to a single point .",
    "moreover the point at which the reflected rays are focused can be almost freely chosen , with very few restrictions .",
    "these two results are in a way more precise that the malus - dupin theorem , since they precisely indicate the nature of the reflected family .",
    "finally , hamilton proves the malus - dupin theorem itself .",
    "let me first prove some formulae which follow from the laws of reflection .",
    "let @xmath24 be local coordinates in the family of rays @xmath4 defined on an open neighbourhood @xmath11 of @xmath25 in @xmath26 . for each @xmath27 ,",

    "we obtain @xmath57 let us take the scalar product with @xmath35 ( respectively , with @xmath34 ) of both sides of the first ( respectively second ) equality , and let us add the two equalities so obtained . since the vectors @xmath35 and @xmath34 , are unitary , @xmath58 and @xmath59 therefore @xmath60 where the dot @xmath61 stands for the scalar product of vectors .",
    "the laws of reflection show that the vectors @xmath62 and @xmath32 are parallel .",
    "moreover any infinitesimal variation @xmath63 of the vector @xmath44 is tangent to the surface @xmath23 at @xmath31 , therefore is orthogonal to @xmath32 .",

    "he chooses all the points @xmath38 coincident with @xmath68 .",
    "therefore @xmath69 , since @xmath70 does not depend on @xmath28 , so equality @xmath71 above becomes @xmath72 hamilton chooses the point @xmath36 on each incoming light ray @xmath29 in such a way that @xmath73 then @xmath74 which proves that any infinitesimal variation of @xmath36 is orthogonal to @xmath35 . if the point @xmath75 is regular on the ray @xmath76 , the points @xmath36 draw a small smooth surface when @xmath28 varies around @xmath25 , which is orthogonally crossed by the rays @xmath29 .",
