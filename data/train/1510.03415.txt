    "these sets are identified with the fluid within the space they occupy at time @xmath11 and are linked between themselves by the rotational and elastic forces as illustrated on figures 1 - 7 .",
    "the points @xmath16 s represent the centers of mass of the respective parts of swimmer s body .",
    "the instantaneous velocity of each part is calculated as the average fluid velocity within it at time  @xmath11 .",
    "below , for simplicity of notations , we will denote the sets @xmath17 also as @xmath18 or @xmath19 and will assume the following two conditions on swimmer s body :    * ( h1 ) * _ all sets @xmath20 are obtained by shifting the same set @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is open and lies in a ball @xmath24 of radius @xmath25 , and its center of mass is the origin ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "<S> we study the local controllability properties of 2-@xmath0 and 3-@xmath0 bio - mimetic swimmers employing the change of their geometric shape to propel themselves in an incompressible fluid described by navier - stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that swimmers bodies consist of finitely many parts , identified with the fluid they occupy , that are subsequently linked by the rotational and elastic internal forces . </S>",
    "<S> these forces are explicitly described and serve as the means to affect the geometric configuration of swimmers bodies . </S>",
    "<S> similar models were previously investigated in @xcite-@xcite .     </S>"
