    "one of the most successful dynamical systems ideas in the study of turbulent flows has been the _ proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) _",
    "pod has been used to generate _ reduced - order models ( roms ) _ for the prediction and control of structure dominated turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "the idea is straightforward : instead of using billions of local finite element basis functions equally distributed in space , pod uses only a few ( usually @xmath0 ) global basis functions that represent the most energetic structures in the system .",
    "thus , the computational cost in a _ direct numerical simulation ( dns ) _ of a complex flow can be reduced by orders of magnitude when pod is employed .    despite its widespread use (",
    "hundreds of papers being published every year ) , pod has several well - documented drawbacks . in this report",
    ", we address one of them , namely the numerical instability of a straightforward pod galerkin procedure applied to a complex flow @xcite . to address this issue",
    ", we draw inspiration from the methodologies used in the numerical stabilization of finite element discretization of convection - dominated flows .",
    "specifically , we employ the _ variational multiscale ( vms ) _ approach used by layton in @xcite , which adds artificial viscosity only to the smallest resolved scales .",

    "without loss of generality , we assume in what follows that the boundary conditions are homogeneous dirichlet .",
    "we emphasize that the new vms - pod model targets turbulent flows described by the _ navier - stokes equations ( nse)_. we chose the mathematical setting in , however , because it is simple , yet relevant to our ultimate goal ( since @xmath11 ) .",
    "of course , once we fully understand the behavior of the new vms - pod model in this simplified setting , we will analyze and apply it in the nse setting .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s_vms_pod ]",
    ", we briefly describe the pod methodology and introduce the new vms - pod model .",
    "the error analysis for the finite element discretization of the new model is presented in section [ s_estimates ] .",
    "the new methodology is tested numerically in section [ s_numerics ] for a problem displaying shock - like phenomena .",
    "finally , section [ s_conclusions ] presents the conclusions and future research directions .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the pod . for a detailed presentation ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be a real hilbert space endowed with the inner product @xmath13 , and @xmath14 $ ] be the state variable of a dynamical system .",
    "given the time instances @xmath15 $ ] , we consider the ensemble of snapshots @xmath16 with dim @xmath17 .",
    "the pod seeks a low - dimensional basis @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , which optimally approximates the input collection .",
    "specifically , the pod basis satisfies @xmath20 subject to the conditions that @xmath21 . in order to solve ,",
    "we consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath22 where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , is the snapshot correlation matrix , @xmath25 are the positive eigenvalues , and @xmath26 are the associated eigenvectors .",
    "it can then be shown ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , that the solution of is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-th component of the eigenvector @xmath30 .",
    "it can also be shown that the following error formula holds : @xmath31 in what follows , we will use the notation @xmath32 although @xmath12 can be any real hilbert space , in what follows we consider @xmath33 .    in the form it has been presented so far",
    ", pod seems to be only a data compression technique .",
    "indeed , equation simply says that the pod basis is the best possible approximation of order @xmath34 of the given data set . in order to make pod a predictive tool , one couples the pod with the galerkin procedure .",
    "this , in turn , yields a rom , i.e. , a dynamical system that represents the evolution in time of the galerkin truncation .",
    "we now briefly present the derivation of this rom , we highlight one of its main drawbacks and we propose a method to address this deficiency .",
    "the pod - galerkin truncation is the approximation @xmath35 of @xmath36 : @xmath37 plugging into and multiplying by test functions in @xmath38 yields the _ pod - galerkin ( pod - g ) _ model @xmath39 the main advantage of the pod - g model over a straightforward _ finite element ( fe ) _ discretization of is clear - the computational cost of the former is dramatically lower than that of the latter .",
    "there are , however , several well - documented disadvantages of , such as its numerical instability in convection - dominated flows @xcite . to address this issue",
    ", we draw inspiration from the methodologies used in numerical stabilization of finite element discretizations of such flows .      the _ variational multiscale ( vms ) _ method introduced by hughes and his group @xcite has been successful in the numerical stabilization of turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "the idea in vms is straightforward : instead of adding artificial viscosity to all resolved scales , in vms artificial viscosity is only added to the smallest resolved scales .",
    "thus , the small scale oscillations are eliminated without polluting the large scale components of the approximation .",
    "the vms method has been extensively developed , various numerical methods being used .",
    "the finite element discretization of the resulting vms model has evolved in several directions : hughes and his group proposed a vms formulation for the nse in which a smagorinsky model @xcite was added only to the smallest resolved scales @xcite .",
    "a different type of vms approach , based on the residual of the nse , was proposed in bazilevs et al .",
    "one of the earliest vms ideas for convection - dominated convection - diffusion equations was proposed by guermond in @xcite . in this vms formulation ,",
    "the smallest scales were modeled by using finite element spaces enriched with bubble functions .",
    "layton proposed in @xcite a vms approach similar to that of guermond . in this vms approach , however , the smallest resolved scales were modeled by projection on a coarser mesh .",
    "the vms approach proposed in @xcite was extended to the nse in a sequence of papers by john and kaya @xcite .",
    "the variational formulation used by the fe methodology fits very well with the vms approach .",
    "the definition of the smallest resolved scales , however , often poses many challenges to the fe method .",
    "indeed , one needs to enrich the fe spaces with bubble functions @xcite , consider hierarchical fe bases @xcite , or use a projection on a coarser mesh @xcite .",
    "pod represents the perfect setting for the vms methodology , since the hierarchy of the basis is already present .",
    "indeed , the pod basis functions are already listed in descending order of their kinetic energy content .",
    "based on this observation , we next propose a vms based pod model . to this end",
    ", we consider the following spaces : @xmath40 where @xmath41 will be defined later .",
    "note that @xmath42 we also consider @xmath43 , the orthogonal projection of @xmath44 on @xmath41 , defined by @xmath45 let also @xmath46 .",
    "we are now ready to define the _ variational multiscale proper orthogonal decomposition ( vms - pod ) model _ : @xmath47 the third term on the lhs of represents the artificial viscosity that is added only to the smallest resolved scales of the gradient .",
    "we note that , although a vms - pod approach was announced in @xcite and another one was used in @xcite , to the authors knowledge this is the first time that the vms formulation in @xcite is applied in a pod setting .    in the next two sections",
    ", we will first estimate the error made in the finite element discretization of the new vms - pod model and then use it in a numerical test .",
    "in this section , we prove estimates for the average error @xmath48 , where the approximation @xmath49 is the solution of ( the weak form of ) and @xmath50 is the solution of ( the fe discretization of the vms - pod model ) . to this end , we follow the approach in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our presentation is different in that it has to include several results pertaining to the pod setting . to this end",
    ", we use some of the developments in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we start by introducing some notation and we list several results that will be used throughout this section . for clarity of notation , we will denote by @xmath51 a generic constant that can depend on all the parameters in the system , except on @xmath52 ( the number of pod modes retained in the galerkin truncation ) , @xmath53 ( the number of snapshots ) , @xmath34 ( the number of pod modes used in the pod - g model ) , @xmath54 ( the number of pod modes used in the projection operator in the vms - pod model ) , @xmath55 ( the mesh - size in the fe discretization ) , @xmath56 ( the artificial viscosity coefficient ) , and @xmath57 ( the diffusion coefficient ) . of particular interest",
    "is the independence of the generic constant @xmath51 from @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , we will prove estimates that are _ uniform with respect to @xmath57 _ , which is important when convection - dominated flows ( such as the nse ) are considered .",
    "we introduce the bilinear forms @xmath58 and @xmath59 we also consider the weighted norm @xmath60 we now make the following assumption , which is used in proving the well - posedness of the weak formulation of .",
    "@xmath61    [ assumption_coercivity ]    for the fe discretization of , we consider a family of finite dimensional subspaces @xmath62 of @xmath63 , such that , for all @xmath64 , the following assumption is satisfied .",
    "@xmath65    [ assumption_approximability ]    where @xmath66 is the order of accuracy of @xmath67 .",
    "we also assume that the finite element spaces @xmath67 satisfy the following inverse estimate .",
    "@xmath68    [ assumption_inverse_fem ]    a similar inverse estimate for pod is proven in @xcite . for completeness , we present it below .",

    "since @xmath81 is symmetric , its matrix 2-norm is equal to its rayleigh quotient @xcite : @xmath83 .",

    "indeed , since @xmath94 is the identity matrix when @xmath95 , we get : @xmath96 we note , however , that in general might not hold .",
