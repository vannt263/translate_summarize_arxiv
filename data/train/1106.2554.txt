    "recent observations of nearby clusters of galaxies have shown that some galaxies in the clusters have cometary tails ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the optical band ,",
    "for example , @xcite found an long and narrow ( @xmath0  kpc ) tail associated with the galaxy d  100 in the coma cluster .",
    "the relative velocity between the tail and the host galaxy is @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite discovered an unusual complex of the narrow blue filaments derived from the galaxy rb  199 in the coma cluster and bright knots in these filaments .",
    "these knots are found to be young stars .",
    "their masses are @xmath3@xmath4 and their sizes are @xmath5  pc . judging from their colors ,",
    "they are estimated to be formed @xmath6 yr ago .",
    "the distance between the host galaxy and the knots is @xmath7  kpc @xcite . in the x - ray band",
    ", @xcite found a comet - like structure around one of the brightest galaxies in abell  2670 .",
    "@xcite also found the x - ray tails associated with the spiral galaxy eso  137 - 001 in abell  3627 .",
    "they confirmed active star - formation in the tails even at positions @xmath8  kpc away from the host galaxy . in the infrared band , @xcite discovered a molecular hydrogen tail with an h@xmath9 mass of approximately @xmath10 extending 20  kpc from eso  137 - 001 .",
    "it is often believed that the tails are created through ram - pressure stripping of interstellar medium of galaxies , which has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "recently , detailed numerical simulations of the ram - pressure stripping and formation of the tails have been performed @xcite . however , although the resolution of the numerical simulations has increased , it is still difficult to resolve physical processes on a scale of molecular clouds .",
    "for example , in current simulations on galactic scales , it would be difficult to resolve kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability , which is expected to develop around a molecular cloud moving along the galactic tail .    in this paper",
    ", we study the formation of the galactic tails and star - formation in them .",
    "we consider disk galaxies with abundant gas as the host galaxies .",
    "we especially focus on the molecular clouds in which the stars were born .",
    "we estimate the growth time of kh instability around the clouds and compare it with the time - scale of star - formation in the clouds , which is affected by the ram - pressure on them .",
    "for these purposes , we assume that the molecular clouds are gravitationally bound and we use the virial theorem for the clouds .",
    "in this section , we discuss the formation process of the tails through ram - pressure stripping . since we are interested in the star - formation in the tails , we argue whether the molecular clouds that produce stars in the tails were formed in the tails or in the host galaxy .",
    "although the number density of intracluster medium ( icm ) is low ( @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the mass of a hydrogen atom ) , ram - pressure on a galaxy is relatively large , because the galaxy moves very fast ( typically @xmath13 ) in a cluster . the ram - pressure is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the velocity of the galaxy relative to the icm .",
    "on the other hand , the gravity from the galaxy per unit area is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the gravitational surface mass density of the galaxy , @xmath19 is the rotation velocity , and @xmath20 is the radius of the disk @xcite .",
    "the column density of the gas we consider is given by @xmath21 .",
    "most numerical simulations have implicitly considered ram - pressure stripping of h gas with a density of @xmath22 .",
    "as their results have been shown , the h gas can easily be stripped .",
    "in fact , if we replace @xmath21 by the typical value of the gas column density of the disk , @xmath23 ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is written as @xmath24 and is comparable to @xmath25 in equation  ( [ eq : ramp ] ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath15 is larger than @xmath26 , the gas is stripped .",
    "next , we consider the ram - pressure stripping of a molecular cloud in a galaxy , which is expect to be more difficult than that of h gas , because of its high density @xcite . in this case , @xmath21 in equation  ( [ eq : fg ] ) should be replaced by the column density of the molecular cloud .",
    "the virial theorem for a molecular cloud gives the relation between the mass @xmath27 , the radius @xmath28 , and the external pressure @xmath29 of the cloud : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant @xcite .",
    "if we define the column density of the cloud as @xmath33 and assume that the cloud is affected by the ram - pressure ( @xmath34 ) , the column density is given by @xmath35 thus , from equation  ( [ eq : fg ] ) we obtain @xmath36 equations  ( [ eq : ramp ] ) and ( [ eq : fgc ] ) show that the ram - pressure can not overcome the gravity from the galaxy ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the larger ram - pressure means the larger column density of a molecular cloud [ equation  ( [ eq : sigc ] ) ] , which tend to prevent ram - pressure stripping of the cloud [ equation  ( [ eq : fgc ] ) ] .",
    "it is to be noted , however , there seem to be galaxies in which molecular clouds have been stripped ; ngc  4522 is an example @xcite . for this galaxy",
    ", @xcite indicated that the galaxy might have undergone extremely strong ram - pressure stripping .",
    "they speculated that the relative velocity between the galaxy and the surrounding icm was larger because of the internal motion of the icm .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath25 is comparable to @xmath40 [ equations  ( [ eq : ramp ] ) and ( [ eq : fgc ] ) ] .",
    "if this was the case , the clouds could have been stripped .",
    "moreover , smaller gravity of a galaxy ( @xmath41 ) makes ram - pressure stripping easier [ equation  ( [ eq : fgc ] ) ] .",
    "although ram - pressure stripping of molecular clouds is difficult to happen , the observations may suggest that the galaxy has been affected by exceptionally strong ram - pressure .",
    "we also note that equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) is not valid when the environment of a cloud rapidly changes . according to the virial theorem for a cloud , @xmath42 @xcite . for @xmath43",
    "pc and @xmath44 , we obtain @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the typical time - scale of the evolution of the cloud is @xmath46  yr .",
    "this may be compared with the time - scale of ram - pressure stripping ( @xmath47  yr ; e.g. @xcite ) . in this subsection , however , we use equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) just to check the condition of ram - pressure stripping . for that purpose ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) is appropriate enough , because we do not consider the evolution of the cloud during the stripping .",
    "moreover , extremely large ram - pressure is required to strip the cloud as indicated above .",
    "thus , when the cloud is stripped , interstellar medium with lower density has already been stripped from the galaxy , and the cloud interacts directly with the icm .",
    "therefore , external pressure on the cloud does not change much during the stripping .    in the following ,",
    "we also consider molecular clouds in a tail away from the host galaxy .",
    "for these clouds , the change of the environment is very slow .",
    "for example , the crossing time of the host galaxy in a cluster is @xmath48  mpc/@xmath49  yr .",
    "therefore , the change of the environment does not affect the evolution of the cloud and we can use equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , stars are often found @xmath8  kpc behind the host galaxies in clusters .",
    "since each star is very dense , it is obvious that it is not affected by ram - pressure . in other words ,",
    "ram - pressure can not decelerate stars and draw them away from the host galaxy .",
    "this means that the gas that makes up the stars at present has been drawn from the galaxy not in the form of stars but in the form of diffuse gas .",
    "the question is whether the gas was in the form of h gas or molecular clouds when it was migrating from the host galaxy .",
    "first , we consider the migration of h gas . for simplicity , we assume that the h gas in the galactic disk is stripped at one time , because the time - scale of the ram - pressure stripping is very short ( @xmath47  yr ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the h gas blob is @xmath50 the equation of motion for the gas blob is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the velocity of the blob relative to the icm . for given @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath20",
    ", one can solve equation  ( [ eq : vhi ] ) and obtain the distance between the blob and the host galaxy , if it is assumed that the blob is detached from the galaxy with the velocity of the galaxy , @xmath15 , at @xmath55 .",
    "it is to be noted that a galaxy is not decelerated by ram - pressure on a time - scale of @xmath56  yr @xcite .",
    "for example , if we assume that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , the distance between the blob and the galaxy is @xmath61  kpc at @xmath62  yr ( figure  [ fig : dist ] ) .",
    "the distance is comparable to the observed length of tails ( e.g. @xcite ) . even at this time ,",
    "the velocity of the gas is still large ( @xmath63 ) . in reality , the h gas blob could decelerate faster than the estimation above , because the blob should be shattered through the interaction with the surrounding icm , which increases the surface area of the gas per unit mass .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f1.eps    next , we consider the migration of a molecular cloud .",
    "the equation of motion for the cloud is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the velocity of the cloud relative to the icm . from equation ( [ eq : virial ] )",
    ", it can be easily shown that @xmath66 .",
    "numerically , if we assume that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the distance between the blob and the galaxy is @xmath48  kpc even at @xmath62  yr ( figure  [ fig : dist ] ) . compared with the h gas blob , the distance is small , because the cloud is denser and the ram - pressure per unit mass is smaller .",
    "since the maximum age of a molecular cloud is @xmath6  yr ( section  [ sec : form ] ) , this estimation indicates that the cloud can not travel the distance between the host galaxy and the positions where star - formation has been observed ( @xmath69  kpc ; e.g. @xcite ) .    in summary ,",
    "the results we present in sections  [ sec : ram ] and [ sec : mig ] show that in general the molecular clouds that bring forth stars away from the host galaxy were formed neither inside nor close to the host galaxy .",
    "in other words , dense part of the h gas that makes up the galactic tails condenses into molecular clouds even away from the galaxy .",
    "the gas of the tail has a velocity comparable to that of the host galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we expect that the molecular clouds that are formed in the tail away from the galaxy also have large velocities .",
    "therefore , the interaction with the surrounding icm could lead to the development of kh instability around the clouds .",
    "since observations show that stars are born in the tails , kh instability must be suppressed until the clouds turn into the stars .",
    "we do not consider thermal conduction for simplicity ( see section  [ sec : mag ] ) .    if the self - gravity of a clouds is large enough , kh instability is completely suppressed .",
    "the condition is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the density of the molecular cloud and is given by @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) and assuming that @xmath73 , relation  ( [ eq : mcr ] ) can be written as @xmath74 since @xmath31 @xcite , the left hand of relation  ( [ eq : mcr2 ] ) can vary from -0.4 to 0.9 .",
    "this means that the cloud is at the boundary between stable and unstable states and that the relation  ( [ eq : mcr ] ) is not a sufficient criterion of stability in our case .",
    "thus , we need to compare the growth time - scale of kh instability ( @xmath75 ) with the time - scale of star - formation in the cloud ( @xmath76 ) .      when kh instability is not completely suppressed , the growth time of the instability is given by @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath28 is the function of @xmath27 and @xmath78 [ equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) ] .",
    "the star - formation in a molecular cloud under external pressure was studied by @xcite .",
    "the equation for the rate of change of gas mass in the cloud is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the total mass of the embedded stars , @xmath81 is the luminosity of the stars , @xmath82 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , and @xmath83 is dimensionless constant .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dmc / dt ] ) means that the gas mass decreases because of the star - formation and the evaporation by the stellar radiation .",
    "assuming @xmath84 , and using equation  ( [ eq : virial ] ) and observational results to determine @xmath85 and @xmath83 , one can solve equation  ( [ eq : dmc / dt ] ) , and obtain the time when @xmath86 for given @xmath87 and external pressure @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "since a significant proportion of the molecular gas in the cloud converts to stars in this time - scale , we define this time - scale as the time - scale of the star - formation in the cloud ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f2.eps    figure  [ fig : time ] shows @xmath75 and @xmath76 for molecular clouds with various masses @xmath27 [ @xmath87 for @xmath76 ] and velocities @xmath65 .",
    "we fixed @xmath89 and @xmath90 and gave the external pressure by @xmath73 .",
    "the formation time @xmath76 in the figure shows that a cloud disappears within @xmath91  yr even if there is no kh instability .",
    "the comparison between @xmath76 and @xmath75 indicates that the cloud should be destroyed by kh instability before forming stars if @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the uncertainty of @xmath94 does not affect the conclusion . on the other hand , although the velocities of stars formed in tails have not been observationally studied well , the relative velocity of the tail gas to the host galaxy is @xmath95 in the case of eso  137 - 001 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is likely that stars are forming in clouds with velocities of @xmath96 .",
    "one idea to overcome this contradiction is that clouds in tails take a value of @xmath94 so that they are completely stable against kh instability [ equation  ( [ eq : mcr2 ] ) ] .",
    "however , there is no solid ground for that .",
    "moreover , there may be some other uncertainties other than @xmath94 , because our estimation is simple .",
    "therefore , we consider more persuasive reason for the stability of a cloud in the next subsection .      it is known that magnetic fields suppress kh instability .",
    "the interface between the two magnetized fluids is stable if @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the magnetic field of the icm and @xmath99 is the one of a cloud @xcite .",
    "even if the cloud is almost neutral , minor ionization makes the relation  ( [ eq : tb ] ) applicable @xcite . since @xmath100",
    ", the relation can be written as @xmath101 the typical values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that magnetic fields stabilize the surface of clouds in galactic tails even if their self - gravity alone can not .",
    "moreover , if the fields are stretched along the surface , thermal conduction will be suppressed @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that similar phenomena may have been observed in clusters .",
    "@xcite indicated that magnetic fields may suppress the development of kh instability at contact discontinuities ( cold fronts ) observed in icm .",
    "they also pointed out that the magnetic fields may suppress the thermal conduction across the discontinuity .",
    "our results show that molecular clouds with small velocities can survive without magnetic fields .",
    "however , it is unlikely that only molecular clouds with high velocities have magnetic fields . it may be natural to assume that molecular clouds in the tails have similar magnetic fields regardless of their velocities",
    "recent observations have shown that some galaxies in clusters have long tails ( @xmath104  kpc ) and stars are forming in the tails .",
    "we have studied the formation of the tails and the star - formation in them , using the virial theorem for gravitationally - bound molecular clouds .",
    "our scenario for the tail and star - formation can be summarized as follows .",
    "* h gas is stripped from a galaxy by ram - pressure from the icm . on the other hand , molecular clouds in the galaxy",
    "are not directly stripped because of the large gravity from the galaxy per unit surface area , unless the ram - pressure is extremely strong ( section  [ sec : ram ] ) . *",
    "while h gas is easily decelerated by ram - pressure , molecular clouds are not , because they are denser .",
    "this means that the overall structure of the long tail is formed by the h gas , and that molecular clouds that generate stars away from the host galaxy had condensed in the tail at positions away from the host galaxy . in other words ,",
    "the clouds have not migrated from the host galaxy or from the neighbor of the host galaxy ( section  [ sec : mig ] ) . * for kh instability on their surfaces , the clouds are on the boundary between stable and unstable states , if only the self - gravity of the clouds is considered . however ,",
    "if reasonable magnetic fields exist , they can suppress the development of kh instability ( section  [ sec : form ] ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) indicated that star - formation is active in galaxies affected by ram - pressure until their interstellar medium disappears .",
    "this will be applied to the galaxies with tails .",
    "we suppose that the galaxies with tails are the ones that have abundant gas and fall into the central region of clusters for the first time . they may be actively generating stars in the main bodies and the tails .",
    "this is consistent with recent observations of galaxies in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the appearance of the tail would change as a galaxy falls toward the cluster center . in the outer region of a cluster",
    ", h gas is stripped from an infalling galaxy and the tail develops .",
    "as the galaxy reaches the central region of the cluster , some of the h gas cools and condenses into molecular clouds .",
    "the rest of it will be mixed with the icm . as the velocity of the galaxy and the icm density increases , the ram - pressure on the clouds increases .",
    "thus , the star - formation time - scale of the clouds is reduced ( figure  [ fig : time ] ) , and the star - formation becomes more efficient until the clouds are consumed in the star - formation .",
    "h@xmath105 emission may be observed around this dense gas @xcite .",
    "some of the h gas that was mixed with the icm may be compressed by the ambient icm with high - pressure and may emit x - rays @xcite ."
