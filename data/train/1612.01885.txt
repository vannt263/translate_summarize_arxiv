    "although skyrmions have been proposed@xcite long ago , there has been a strong rise in interest in recent years spurred by experimental observations of skyrmionic phases in various magnetic thin - films@xcite .",
    "magnetic skyrmions are characterized by a topologically nontrivial mapping from a two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic system in real space into three - dimensional spin space .",
    "this mapping leads to a topological charge @xmath0 which characterizes the skyrmion and is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the normalized magnetization vector field and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spatial coordinates of the 2d magnetic layer@xcite .",
    "magnetic skyrmions are attractive candidates for magnetic storage of classical information@xcite because they are topologically stable in the sense that no continuous local deformation in the magnetic texture can remove a skyrmion ( _ i.e. _ , change @xmath0 ) , and they can be manipulated at high speed with relatively low current densities@xcite . furthermore , because skyrmions coupled to conventional superconductors are known to support majorana fermions@xcite , they may be a route to topological quantum computation@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of any classical magnetic texture with fixed magnitude , @xmath2 , is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite .",
    "the dynamic properties of skyrmions can be considerably simplified by considering the motion of the average magnetic texture@xcite , which reduces to an equation of motion for the skyrmion s center - of - mass coordinate , known as thiele s equation .",
    "this skyrmion coordinate behaves as a massless dirac - like particle under a magnus force proportional to @xmath0@xcite , and a possible damping is parameterized by a phenomenological velocity - dependent term that is induced by the coupling of the skyrmion motion to other degrees of freedom in the system such as electrons , phonons , magnons , etc . ;",
    "the microscopic details of this coupling are typically left unspecified . using this phenomenological approach ,",
    "several generalized equations have been proposed@xcite for a rigid magnetic structure in the presence of external static as well as rapidly changing forces .",
    "the thermal diffusion of a driven skyrmion has been studied within the classical framework by a numerical solution of the stochastic llg equation@xcite , where random fields are included to model the effects of thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , for small skyrmions at the nanometer scale , the size of skyrmions in state - of - the - art experiments@xcite , quantum fluctuations are expected to become relevant@xcite and the classical llg equation is expected to break down . in a fully quantum mechanical treatment starting from the spin and other degrees of freedom present in the system the quantum dynamics of the skyrmion should emerge naturally , giving rise for instance to possible mass and dissipation terms linked to the underlying microscopics .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide such a quantum treatment of skyrmions in insulating magnetic films .",
    "thereby we will restrict ourselves to systems where only spin degrees of freedom are present and other sources such as phonons and itinerant electrons are assumed to be negligibly small ( due to low enough temperatures ) or entirely absent , respectively . by employing quantum field theory methods and the fadeev - popov techniques for collective coordinates  @xcite ,",
    "applied to magnetic systems  @xcite , we will derive the quantum dynamics of the skyrmion in a systematic way , thereby going beyond the classical limit . within this formalism the skyrmion position , which parametrizes the classical static solution of the euler - lagrange equations , is promoted to a time - dependent dynamical variable and a finite perturbation theory in terms of fluctuations around the skyrmion configuration is performed .",
    "the interaction of the skyrmion with these magnon modes gives rise to dissipation and to a non - local damping kernel whose form we obtain in a closed form and can evaluate analytically in some regimes of physical interest . in particular , we are able to microscopically calculate the contribution to the damping in the thiele equation from the incoherent magnon modes which in general depends on the magnetic dispersion relation and thus on the details of the free energy of the system .    for asymptotic ( imaginary ) times , we find that the damping kernel becomes local in time and reduces to a simple mass term which we can calculate explicitly in the presence of non - uniform magnetic traps and spatially dependent exchange interactions for arbitrary temperatures .",
    "specifically , in the zero  temperature limit we find that local defects and magnetic traps which break translational symmetry induce a finite mass so that the skyrmion motion is no longer dirac  like but rather follows a quadratic dispersion law of a massive particle . as a striking consequence , we find that in quasi - one dimensional wire geometries the skyrmion acquires a finite mass .",
    "such geometries are provided for instance by anisotropic magnetic traps , similar to linear tracks used for magnetic memory and logic devices @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this shows that skyrmions in quantum confined geometries exhibit a fundamentally different dynamical behaviour compared to the one in unconfined geometries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.quant ] we derive a coherent - state path integral for a generic magnetic texture , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : skyrmion mass ] , we utilize this functional integral approach to calculate the damping experienced by such a magnetic texture as a result of the coupling to magnon fluctuations , and we also demonstrate that this damping reduces to a simple mass term . in sec .  [",
    "sec : chiral magnets ] , we apply our formalism to a chiral magnet and show in sec.[subsec : mass zero t ] , that only a spatially nonuniform perturbation to the magnetic texture induces a skyrmion mass at zero temperature . to complete the description we examine in sec.[subsec : mass finite t ] the skyrmion mass at finite temperatures .",

    "<S> we study the quantum propagation of a skyrmion in chiral magnetic insulators by generalizing the micromagnetic equations of motion to a finite temperature path integral formalism , using field theoretic tools . promoting the center of the skyrmion to a dynamic quantity , the fluctuations around the skyrmionic configuration give rise to a time  </S>",
    "<S> dependent damping of the skyrmion motion . from the frequency dependence of the damping kernel </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to identify the skyrmion mass , thus providing a microscopic description of the kinematic properties of skyrmions . when the free energy is translationally invariant we find the skyrmion mass is finite only at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , if defects are present or a magnetic trap is applied , the skyrmion mass acquires a finite value , even at vanishingly small temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a skyrmion in a confined geometry provided by a magnetic trap behaves as a massive particle owing to its quasi  one dimensional confinement . </S>"
