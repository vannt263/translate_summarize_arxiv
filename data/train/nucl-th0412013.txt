    "in the recent past eremin and voloshin@xcite proposed that both nucleons and individual nuclei could be considered as superposition of the constituents ( of the particles ) called partons / quarks / valons etc .",
    "normally it is assumed that the nucleons are built of three such constituent partons and the mesons are composed of two of them .",
    "such a constituent picture helps us to interpret the deep inelastic collision processes involving lepton - hadron , hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions .",
    "much earlier , bialas et al studied to explore the hypothesis , within the framework of the additive quark model(aqm)@xcite , that the constituent partons(quarks ) provide the universal elements not only of nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleus reactions but also nucleus- nucleus interactions at high energies ; this study ended up with surely an affirmative indication to such a possibility.but , as the focus was on different issues , the central theme of this work deviated from what it is intended to be here.we will simply look into the behaviour of some chosen observables studied here for nucleus - nucleus collisions alone from the viewpoint of such partonic constituent pictures .",
    "the centrality - dependence of multiplicity - density offers a very fundamental observable and we present here our studies on production of pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons separately in both @xmath0(including deuteron production for this collision ) at cern - sps and @xmath1 collisions at rhic - bnl at @xmath2 and 200 gev respectively . besides",
    ", very recently the data on deuteron production in @xmath0 collision have been obtained , for which they have also been taken here into account .",
    "this apart , we will also compare the performance of the present approach with those obtained on the basis of some standard - version programmings like hijing , venus etc which are essentially much more complicated than the one dealt with here .",
    "our objective here is to examine the efficacy of this approach in explaining some relevant data on production of these very important kind of secondaries in the few now available high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the approach was also successfully tested for production of neutral particles , like photons , by netrakanti and mohanty@xcite in the very recent past and was found to be in accord with the contention of eremin and voloshin@xcite .",
    "in course of our calculations for the number of participant nucleons , denoted by @xmath3 , and the number of participant partons , denoted by @xmath4 we follow exactly the ways adopted by eremin and voloshin@xcite and netrakanti and mohanty@xcite , wherein a woods - saxon nuclear density profile is taken into account .",
    "this is given by    @xmath5}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the number of participant nucleons(@xmath3 ) for a nucleus - nucleus(@xmath9 ) collision at an impact parameter @xmath10 is calculated using the expression@xcite ,    @xmath11^b\\}\\\\ & + & ~ \\int ~ d^2s ~ t_b(\\vec{s}-\\vec{b } ) ~ \\{~ 1 ~ -[~ 1 ~ - ~ \\frac{\\sigma_{nn}^{inel } t_a(\\vec{s})}{a } ~ ] ^a\\ } , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass numbers of the two colliding nuclei , @xmath14 is the thickness function , and @xmath15 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the number of participant partons is also calculated in a similar manner by taking into account the following changes of the facts related to physical realities , viz . , ( i ) the density is changed to three times that of nucleon density with @xmath16 ; ( ii ) the cross sections are changed to @xmath17 and ( iii ) the mass numbers of the colliding nuclei are changed to three times of their values keeping the size of the nuclei same as in the cases of @xmath3@xcite .    in the same way , the number of participant partons in a @xmath18 or @xmath19 collision can also be calculated by using @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and considering nucleons as hard spheres of uniform radii 0.8 @xmath22@xcite .    for the present work we use",
    "@xmath23 30 mb in the range of c.m .",
    "energies @xmath24 4 - 17.3 gev as suggested in ref.@xcite . for higher energies",
    ", we first fit the data on total cross - sections for @xmath18 and @xmath19 collisions@xcite at energies beyond @xmath25 gev with the expression@xcite @xmath26 + ( 1.1\\pm0.1)\\ln{(\\frac{s_{nn}}{10 ~ gev^2 } ) } + ( 0.19\\pm0.01)\\ln^2{(\\frac{s_{nn}}{10 ~ gev^2})}\\ ] ]    with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 no .",
    "of data @xmath29 no . of parameters .",
    "we also fit the elastic cross - section data for the same interactions@xcite with a similar type of expression which is given by ,    @xmath30- ( 0.47\\pm0.04)\\ln{(\\frac{s_{nn}}{10 ~ gev^2 } ) } + ( 0.11\\pm0.01)\\ln^2{(\\frac{s_{nn}}{10 ~ gev^2})}\\ ] ]    with @xmath31 . the fits along with the data are shown in fig.1 .",
    "hence , one can obtain the energy - dependence of inelastic cross - section(@xmath15 ) for nucleon - nucleon interaction by subtracting eqn.(4 ) from eqn.(3 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath15 , obtained in this manner , at some energies are given in table-[tab : table1 ] .",
    "the obtained values fall within @xmath32 error of those suggested in ref.@xcite . but a point is to be noted . though some sort of justification for proposing the nature of the total cross section in the form of expression ( 3 ) given in ref.@xcite , none such explanation for expression ( 4 ) is possible .",
    "this is simply assumed with a view to providing only a best fit to the available data on elastic cross section shown in fig.1 and extracting a workable phenomenological form of expression for the nature of inelastic cross section , @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , these twin relations help us to arrive at the usable values of inelastic cross sections needed for our necessary calculations of the relevant observables in a systematic manner even at energies for which no measured data on cross section values are available .",
    "the values of the number of participant nucleons and those of the participant partons for three nucleus - nucleus collisions at various energies and different centralities are presented in the tables([tab : table2]- [ tab : table4 ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the results obtained on the basis of the present work with those of na49@xcite , wa98@xcite and phenix@xcite groups is made in fig.-2(a ) to fig.-2(d ) , in terms of @xmath33 versus @xmath34 .",
    "it is observed that the agreements in cases of au+au collisions are modestly fair , whereas for pb+pb interaction the disagreement is quite strong and prominent .",
    "this discrepancy could , for the present , be attributed to the much less c.m energy in lead - lead reaction which falls roughly at 17.2 gev only .",
    "the integrated yields of the identified hadrons at central rapidity region produced in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at different centralities are presented diagrammatically in fig.3-fig.5 . in subfigures labelled as ( a ) and ( b ) of each category ,",
    "the experimental data on integrated yields are normalized by half of the number of participant nucleons(@xmath3 ) while those in subfigures labelled as ( c ) and ( d ) are normalized by half of the number of participant partons(@xmath4 ) .",
    "as we are here to make comparison between these two cases , we should use values of both the observables obtained from a single model . and",
    "that is why we put into use the values of @xmath35 obtained on the basis of the present work , instead of the values indicated by na49@xcite or phenix groups@xcite .",
    "now , to make a comparison between these two cases we fit the data in fig.3-fig.5 by two phenomenological expressions which are given by ,    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath10 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are four constants .",
    "the fitted values of these parameters are given in tables([tab : table5]-[tab : table7 ] ) and depicted by solid curves in the figures .",
    "as could be seen from fig.2 that the most peripheral values of @xmath3 for @xmath0 collision at @xmath41 gev and @xmath1 collision at @xmath42 gev obtained by the present model show larger discrepancies with respect to those obtained by na49 and phenix collaborations , we keep most peripheral data in these two collisions out of the range of both the fits provided by eqn.(5 ) and eqn.(6 ) .    obviously , the factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 provide the slopes of the fits .",
    "as the magnitude of any of these factors takes value nearer to zero , the fit will exhibit better flatness of the data with respect to @xmath3 or @xmath4 implying a superior compliance of scaling , i.e. , a better scaling .",
    "a look at table-[tab : table5 ] reveals that the data on @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in @xmath0 collisions show a better degree of conformity with scaling when normalized by half of @xmath4 , as in all cases @xmath46 is less than @xmath47 .",
    "but , for the case of deuteron production in @xmath0 collision , the scenario is just the opposite . besides",
    ", the integrated yields for charged pions produced in @xmath1 interactions at both the rhic energies[tables  [ tab : table6 ] - [ tab : table7 ] ] do not exhibit scaling satisfactorily , when the data are normalized by half of @xmath4 instead of @xmath3 , as the values of @xmath47 , in these cases , are quite small with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "however , the data on @xmath44 and @xmath45 produced in the same collisions favour the @xmath4-scaling over the @xmath3-scaling , though the cases of @xmath45 at @xmath42 gev are not as prominent as in the other cases . in fine , our net finding from the present study is the pions do not agree , while the kaons and protons do .",
    "the fig.6(a ) deserves some special attention and comments .",
    "the plots on integrated yields for charged hadrons produced in both nucleus - nucleus(@xmath48 ) and @xmath49 collision deflect from each other when data on both are separately normalized in terms of number of participating nucleons(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the data on integrated yields in central nucleus - nucleus collisions normalized by the number of participant nucleon - pair have been used here from fig.3 of ref.@xcite . to our purpose , this has to be normalized in terms of the basic parton(quark)-constituents , denoted by @xmath50 , for which the ( charged)pseudo- rapidity density terms for various nucleus - nucleus collisions normalized by participant nucleon - pair , i.e. , the factors @xmath51 are to be multiplied by @xmath52 with the values of them as given in table-[tab : table8 ] . and ,",
    "in this conversion we have utilized those particular values of @xmath35 as were used in ref.@xcite , so that we can normalize the exact values of @xmath53 by @xmath54 . in calculating @xmath4 for @xmath49 collisions ,",
    "we use equation(2 ) and the values of @xmath4 for @xmath49 collisions at three different c.m .",
    "energies are given in table-[tab : table9 ] as a function of relative probability .",
    "and when partonic considerations are used in normalization , the data on both @xmath49 and @xmath48 collisions come to an agreeable state .",
    "the @xmath50-values that are to be used for normalization of the most central @xmath49 collisions , i.e.,@xmath55 central collisions are depicted in table-[tab : table10 ] . in order to check the nature of agreement between the data on @xmath48 and @xmath49 collisions",
    ", we try to obtain a fit by taking into account both sets of data , normalized by @xmath54 ; and the desired fit is to be described here by the following expression :    @xmath56    with @xmath57 . the goodness of the fit is also shown in fig.6(b ) with the help of the expression @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 which reveals that both sets of data are in good agreement with respect to the fit . hence ,",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 data exhibit a common @xmath59-dependence when the data on the former are normalized by the number of participant parton - pairs .",
    "very recently , sarkisyan and shakarov@xcite adopted a somewhat similar type approach in dealing with data on pseudorapidity density per participant - pair in cases of hadron - hadron , nucleus - nucleus collisions and also in the cases of @xmath60 interactions .",
    "the study thus reinforced the idea of similarities of the bulk observables in the widest possible ranges of particle - interactions .",
    "let us now summarize our observations made here : ( i ) the secondaries , excluding deuterons , produced in @xmath0 collision at cern - sps behave modestly well vis - a - vis @xmath4 scaling .",
    "the behaviour is more consistent towards the highest values of centrality , with centrality maximum at 0 - 5@xmath61(represented by solid boxes in the graph ) .",
    "( ii ) similar statements could be made about @xmath1 interactions at both energies(fig.4 and fig.5 ) except the cases for pions .",
    "( iii ) it is quite noticeable that there are modest degree of divergences in the @xmath3-values between the calculations done by us at different centralities and those by others , as indicated in the text ( in the second and third columns of the various tables presented in this work ) . for the present",
    ", these discrepancies could be attributed only to our much simpler programming than what is resorted to by the big groups like na49 , wa98 , phenix etc .",
    "the plain fact is we are now simply unable to take up such rigorous studies as might be desired or advisable due to various reasons beyond our capacity and control .",
    "but , we recognize the urgency and importance of such studies in order to arrive at a decision about the merit of @xmath4 scaling and of the viewpoints expressed by eremin and voloshin@xcite .",
    "( iv ) the fig.6 highlights on how the data on both @xmath49 and @xmath48 collisions negotiate better the idea of partonic - participant scaling , when the constituent - participant number for both @xmath49 and @xmath48 collisions are taken into account .",
    "thus , the present study does essentially provide modest support to the viewpoints expressed by eremin and voloshin in their work of ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors are very grateful to the anonymous referee for his / her very patient readings , constructive criticisms and kind valuable instructions for the improvements in the previous drafts of the manuscript .",
    "the authors would also like to express their thankful gratitude to professor d. mi@xmath62kowiec for providing some helpful suggestions about running the fortran code developed by him in calculating the number of participants , @xmath63 .",
