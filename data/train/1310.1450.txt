    "single molecule force spectroscopy ( smfs ) techniques have enhanced our understanding about the inter- and intra- molecular interactions involved in the stability of dna and biological processes _",
    "e.g. _ transcription , replication , slippage , rupture etc .",
    "initially , it was thought that the interactions detected in smfs experiments would be mostly of a mechanical nature and can be calculated by knowing the value of the applied force .",
    "however , insights gathered from these experiments revealed that the measurement of molecular interactions depends not only on the magnitude of the applied force , but also on how and where the force is applied @xcite .",
    "for example , bockelmamm and coworkers @xcite applied the force perpendicular to the helix direction ( dna unzipping ) and measured the unzipping force @xmath0 pn , whereas , lee et al @xcite studied the unbinding of double stranded dna ( dsdna ) by applying a force along the helix direction ( rupture of dna ) , and measured the rupture force , which is one order magnitude greater than the unzipping force .",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the unbinding of dna duplex of various lengths and found that the unbinding force depends on the loading rate and sequence length .",
    "it was also found that changing the pulling direction results different unbinding forces @xcite .    by expressing the bond energy and base - pairing energy in the form of harmonic oscillators in the ladder model of dsdna ( homosequence ) of length @xmath1 base - pairs , de gennes",
    "@xcite proposed the maximum force required for the rupture is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the force required to separate a single base - pair and @xmath4 is the de gennes characteristic length . here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the spring constants of covalent ( backbone ) and hydrogen bonds , respectively .",
    "1 predicts that the rupture force increases linearly with length for small values of @xmath1 and saturates at the higher values of @xmath1 , which is consistent with recent experiment @xcite . in an another study , chakrabarti and",
    "nelson @xcite extended the de gennes model ( nonlinear generalization of the ladder model ) and studied the effects of sequence heterogeneity .",
    "et al _ @xcite considered a homosequence of dna , where the covalent bonds and base - pairing interactions are modeled by the harmonic spring and lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , respectively . using langevin dynamics ( ld ) simulations",
    "@xcite , they obtained the distribution of stretching of hydrogen bonds and the extension in the covalent bonds for a wide range of forces below the rupture , which are experimentally difficult to obtain .    in this paper",
    ", we study the rupture event of the base sequence studied in the recent experiments @xcite . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss results from atomistic simulations with explicit solvent",
    ". we shall confine ourselves to a chain of 12 base - pairs only and focus on the following issues : ( i ) distribution of stretching of hydrogen bonds , and ( ii ) the extension in the covalent bonds along the strand . for the comparison",
    ", we also study a homosequence ( a - t ) of same length as studied in ref .",

    "@xcite , but showed the asymmetry in the distribution for the both cases . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the possible reason for this discrepancy .",
    "since , the computational cost involved in the atomistic computation is very large and beyond our computational limit for a longer dna , we consider a coarse - grained description of dsdna to study the rupture events .",
    "we incorporate consequences arising due to the semi - microscopic details of nucleotides in the model to explain the asymmetry in the distributions . in order to substantiate our findings",
    ", we revisit the ladder model of dna @xcite in sec .",

    "we have chosen the box dimension in such a way that the ruptured dna structure remains fully inside the water box .",
    "for the 12 base - pairs sequence , we have taken the box size of @xmath14@xmath15 which contains 16690 water molecules and 22 @xmath13 ( counterions ) .",
    "the system is equilibrated at @xmath16 for 100 ps under a protocol described in ref .",

    "the dotted lines are guide to the eye . , width=460 ]    to simulate the stretching of hydrogen bonds , we give sufficient time for equilibrium at constant force .",
    "the magnitude of the applied constant force is 570 pn for the 12 base - pairs , which is sufficient enough for separating the both strands of dsdna . to have a better understanding ,",

    "2 , we have shown some of the snapshots of the conformation ( generated by visual molecular dynamics ( vmd ) software @xcite under constant shear force applied at @xmath7 ends at a temperature 320 k. initially , the dsdna remains in the zipped state as shown in fig .",
    "as time passes , the dsdna goes to a ladder form ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) and then complete rupture takes place ( fig .",
    "2 ( e ) ) . fig .",
    "3a shows the variation of extension in hydrogen bond length ( @xmath20 ) and covalent bond length ( @xmath19 ) ( i.e. deviation from their mean length ) along the chain with base position .",
    "we have monitored the distance of @xmath21 atom of complementary bases in dsdna to measure the extension in hydrogen bond length .",
    "we have studied the system just before the rupture .",
    "simulation results show the asymmetry in the distribution of stretching of hydrogen bond ( fig .",
    "3a ) and covalent bonds ( fig .",
    "3b ) . in order to see , whether this asymmetry is because of heterogeneity of the sequence , we have repeated the simulation for a designed homosequence ( aaaaaaaaaaaa ) of the same length .",
    "the rupture force for this sequence is about 460 pn .",
    "it may be noted that the simulation carried out by mishra et al @xcite or the analytical solution proposed by de gennes @xcite , showed that distribution is symmetric for a homosequence chain .",
    "surprisingly , even for a homosequence , one can notice that the extension in hydrogen bonds is more stretched at the pulling end consists of thymine than the end consists of adenine in the atomistic simulations .",
    "the distribution of extension in covalent bonds along the chain also shows the asymmetry .",
    "one can observe that the bonds near the pulling end ( @xmath22-end ) are more stretched and gradually decreases as one approaches the other end ( i.e. , the @xmath23 end ) .",
    "one of the possible reasons for such a discrepancy in theoretical models @xcite is that they incorporate the same elasticity for the both strands . in recent years",
    ", there are considerable studies @xcite on the nature of the elasticity of ssdna strands .",
    "for example , the force - extension curves of ssdna ( or rna ) consisting of similar type of nucleotides show the striking differences @xcite .",
    "it was found that the poly(t ) ( or poly u ) show the entropic response whereas poly(a ) show the plateaus arising due to the base stacking .",
    "these studies provide unequivocal support for the use of different elastic constants for complementary strands ( say adenine and thymine ) in the model .     or @xmath24 ) .",
    ", width=384 ]    in view of this , we now use the coarse - grained description @xcite of the flexible polymer chain to model a dsdna , which allows us to study a system of comparatively larger size .",
    "a chain in the model consists of bead units connected by effective bonds characterized by the stiff springs ( fig .",
    "each effective bond consists of several chemical bonds ( _ e.g. _ sugar phosphate etc . ) .",
    "a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential is used to model the base pairing interaction between complimentary nucleotides .",

    ", @xmath29 corresponds to first ( complimentary ) strand of dsdna .",
    "the distance between intra - strand beads , @xmath30 , is defined as @xmath31 . the simplest approach",
    "to include semi - microscopic effects of nucleotides is to include different elastic constants as discussed above . the harmonic ( first ) term with spring constant @xmath32 ( @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 ) couples the adjacent beads along the two strands .",
    "second term takes care of excluded volume effect _",
    "i.e. _ two beads can not occupy the same space @xcite .",
    "the third term , described by lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , takes care of the mutual interaction between two strands .",
    "the first term of lj potential ( same as second term of eq.2 ) will not allow the overlap of two strands . here , we set @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the second term of lj potential corresponds to the base - pairing between two strands .",
    "the base - pairing interaction is restricted to the native contacts ( @xmath38 ) only _ i.e. _ @xmath27 base of @xmath39 strand forms pair with the @xmath27 base of @xmath40 strand only as shown in fig .",

    "2 , we use dimensionless distances and energy parameters @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of this model is that the ground state conformation is known .",
    "therefore , equilibration is not an issue here , if one wants to study the dynamics under the applied force at low @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "the force - extension ( @xmath57 ) curve is shown in fig . 5 for different lengths .",
    "the @xmath57 curve shows the entropic response at low forces and remains qualitatively similar to the one seen in experiments .",
    "it may be noted that in the ladder model such response is missing as system remains in the stretched state .",

    "the variation of the rupture force as a function of length of the chain for the low temperature ( @xmath58 ) is shown in fig .",

    ", one can observe that the hydrogen bonds near the extreme ends ( up to @xmath65 bases ) get stretched , while the bases in the middle above the de gennes length ( @xmath66 8 to 30 bases ) remain unstretched indicating that the differential shearing force approaches to zero in this region . in figs .",

    "it shows that bonds near the pulling end ( say 5-end ) are stretched more and gradually decrease . after the de gennes length , they saturate and remain almost the same . however ,",
    "when one approaches the other end ( i.e. 3-end ) , there is a change in the slope and the extension is quite less compare to the middle one .",
    "this is because of the fact that the 3-end of first strand is near to the 5-end of the other chain , where a similar force is also applied in the opposite direction . since , the dsdna is in the zipped state , the applied force at 5-end of one strand also pulls the other strand along the opposite direction , which causes a relatively slower increase .",
