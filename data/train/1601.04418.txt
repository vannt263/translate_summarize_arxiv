    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) is one of the most versatile imaging techniques to investigate surface science at the nanoscale .",
    "magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) ,  @xcite a variant of afm with a magnetized tip , plays an important role in studying the formation of magnetic domains in magnetic materials ,  @xcite vortex dynamics in superconductors ,  @xcite and exotic spin structures such as skyrmions .",
    "@xcite so far , several home - built low - temperature mfms have been operated down to the @xmath4he temperature within a single axis magnet .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , mfm apparatus operating under high demanding conditions , such as sub - kelvin temperatures and vector magnetic fields , are rare ,  @xcite although they are useful for understanding unconventional ( e.g. , heavy fermion ) superconductivity  @xcite and quantum / molecular magnetism at the nanoscale under extreme conditions .",
    "@xcite at present the demand for a sub - kelvin mfm is high for investigating @xmath5-electron physics as a recent scanning tunneling microscopy study resolves the competition of @xmath5- and @xmath6-electrons in heavy fermion systems .",
    "@xcite in addition , the use of a vector magnet allows further insight into anisotropy in superconductivity such as non - uniform pairing symmetry and magnetic penetration depth .",
    "@xcite    in this article we report the construction of a @xmath0he mfm with a vector field of 2 - 2 - 9 t for the @xmath1 direction and a base temperature of @xmath3=300 mk .",
    "we calibrate the system s stray field by imaging abrikosov vortices as a function of field , and demonstrate its low temperature and vector field capabilities by resolving the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in a ferromagnetic superconductor at @xmath3= 500 mk , as well as by imaging the change of a single vortex shape depending on the direction of the tip magnetization .",
    "our @xmath0he mfm system allows investigating phenomena emerging under extreme conditions such as superconductivity in heavy fermions , anisotropic superconductivity , and the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "we employ a custom - built @xmath0he cryostat and a low - loss dewar with a vector magnet from janis [ see fig . [ sch](a ) ] .",
    "the outer jacket of the dewar is evacuated to a pressure lower than @xmath7 torr prior to cooldown .",
    "the liquid @xmath4he consumption is about 10 liters a day without magnetic field applied .",
    "to minimize the effect of heat radiation , baffles are installed inside the displacer .",
    "the heat load from electrical wires has been minimized by winding them around thermal anchors which are attached to the 1-k pot .",
    "we control the sample temperature via charcoal , 1-k pot , and @xmath0he pot [ see fig .",
    "[ sch](a ) ] .",
    "the base temperature ( @xmath3=300 mk ) of the @xmath0he pot is reached within 4 hours from @xmath3=4 k and remains for 8 hours if initially all 25 l of @xmath0he gas were condensed .",
    "the three - axis vector magnet is located at the bottom of the dewar as shown in fig . [ sch](a ) and immersed in liquid @xmath4he cryogen .",
    "we can apply the vector field of 2 - 2 - 9 t in each @xmath1 direction with a field homogeneity of @xmath8 over a sphere of 1 cm diameter at the sample position .",
    "the electronics for the vector magnet are supplied by cryomagnetics inc . , and controlled by a home - made labview - based program .",
    "the mfm head consists of three parts : ( i ) the tip stage , ( ii ) the sample stage , and ( iii ) the scanner & @xmath9 coarse positioners .",
    "the tip stage consists of the cantilever , an optical fiber , and two fiber walkers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sch](a ) .",
    "it detaches conveniently from the mfm head , allowing an easy replacement of a cantilever .",
    "the cantilever is secured via a be - cu spring which also establishes an electrical connection for electric scanning probe microscopy modes such as conducting afm , electric force microscopy , and kelvin force microscopy .",
    "we use an optical interferometric system for measuring the cantilever motion that is directly proportional to the force between the tip and sample . a mechanism to optimize the alignment between the cantilever and the fiber end is of importance for low temperature applications .",
    "@xcite therefore , we adopt two compact home - built walkers to control the relative position of the fiber and the tip in the @xmath10-@xmath11 direction : @xmath10 for the cantilever s center in width and @xmath11 for the fiber - tip distance .",
    "the intensity and sensitivity of the mfm signal can be maximized by the following procedure .",
    "first , the @xmath10 walker locates the fiber end at the middle of the cantilever to achieve the maximum signal intensity .",
    "then , the @xmath11 walker regulates the tip - fiber position at the maximum slope of the interference curve to achieve a maximum sensitivity . considering a sinusoidal waveform for the interference signal , @xmath12 , the maximum slope of the signal",
    "is reached at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the tip - fiber distance and @xmath15 is the wavelength ( 1550 nm ) of the laser .",
    "this condition results in : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an integer number . at this point",
    ", the sensitivity of the mfm signal ( @xmath18 ) reaches its maximum , as @xmath19 is maximized .",
    "@xcite      the sample stage is attached directly to the @xmath0he pot via four cu rods , allowing a good thermal anchoring . a horizontal sliding mechanism for replacing the sample holder ensures a safe and easy mounting procedure .",
    "the au - plated cu sample holder has a resistive heater element ( a 9-@xmath20 chip resistor for surface mount ) and a cernox temperature sensor for an additional temperature control together with the @xmath0he - pot control .",
    "we can study several samples during a single cooldown with our multi - sample stage [ see fig . [ sch](b ) ] due to the large walking range of the piezo walkers .",
    "this not only avoids lengthy warm - up and cool - down procedures for changing samples , but it also allows to perform comparative studies among the installed samples under controlled conditions , confirming that the geometry of the cantilever , the tip magnetization , etc .",
    "remain unchanged between the measurements .",
    "the sample holder is grounded electrically to the mfm head [ see fig . [ sch](a ) ]",
    ".      in general , a piezo tube scanner , routinely used in scanning tunneling microscope , offers a simple , cost - efficient , and rigid scanning solution in spite of a crosstalk between @xmath11 and @xmath21 motion as well as a small scan range in the @xmath11 direction . for magnetic force microscopic applications the large scan area is required to image the @xmath22m - size magnetic domains .",
    "we therefore employ a compact , commercially available attocube scanner ( ansxyz100 ) .",
    "its principle is based on a piezo - driven lever arm mechanism and each axis is decoupled from one another .",
    "it offers a scan range of 50@xmath2350@xmath2324 @xmath22m@xmath0 at 300 k and 30@xmath2330@xmath2315 @xmath22m@xmath0 at 4 k , respectively .",
    "we use three attocube walkers ( attocube , anpx101/res , anpz / res ) with a travel distance of 5 mm each for a coarse positioning .",
    "an electrical connection to the scanner and walkers is established through a home - built 24-pin connector at the bottom of the head [ see fig . [ sch](a ) ] .",
    "manganin wires with low thermal and electrical conductivity and cu wires are used for the scanner and the piezo walkers , respectively , because the high resistance of manganin wires results in a large decay time constant , which is detrimental for the performance of a stick - slip walker .",
    "the decay time constant of a driving voltage should be as small as 10 @xmath22sec for a stick - slip walker : for example , the capacitance of the attocube walker is 5 @xmath22f , requiring the wire resistance is as small as 2 @xmath20 .",
    ", width=302 ]    we use a standard sample ( tgxyz01/nm from mikromasch with 20 nm step height and 3 @xmath22 m step width ) for the scanner calibration .",
    "a resulting topographic image obtained at room temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ calibration](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ calibration](b ) we show the mfm image of a hard disk drive obtained in amplitude - modulation mode at ambient conditions with the tip - lift height of 100 nm .",
    "individual magnetic bits are clearly resolved .",
    ", width=302 ]    the optical interferometer system provides a stable , low - noise environment for the detection of a cantilever motion .",
    "@xcite we use a 2@xmath232 coupler with an intensity ratio of 9:1 ( gould fiber optics ) .",
    "a solid state laser ( s3fc1550 , thorlabs ) of @xmath15=1550 nm offers a good control of temperature and power .",
    "the photon energy of the laser ( @xmath15=1550 nm @xmath24 0.8 ev ) is smaller than the band gap of a si cantilever ( @xmath25=1.1 ev ) , and thus transfers less heat than a laser of smaller wavelength .",
    "we minimize the laser fluctuation by adjusting the laser power and temperature by monitoring the stability of the interferogram .",
    "the adjusted laser power delivered to the cantilever is as small as 40 @xmath22w to avoid a direct cantilever heating .",
    "the laser power and temperature on operation are typically 0.34 mw and 23@xmath26c , respectively .",
    "note that such optimal parameters may vary even with the same laser model .",
    "we use angled physical contact ( apc ) plugs for all optical connections to minimize undesired reflections from optical connectors though the laser and the photo detector have built - in physical contact ( pc ) plugs .",
    "therefore , we use a custom spec adaptor to connect pc with apc . the schematic diagram for the interferometer system",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ interferometer ] .",
    "the incident laser beam passes through an optical isolator ( thorlabs io - h-1550apc ) to discriminate any side bands , and is split into two beams via an optical coupler .",
    "90% of the incident beam goes into the photo detector ( new focus model 2117 ) through an attenuator and serves as a reference signal ( blue dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ interferometer ] ) .",
    "the remaining 10% are fed into the microscope head , where they partly transmit through the cleaved fiber end , and reflect at the cantilever .",
    "the remaining part of the beam is reflected at the fiber end , and interferes with the reflected light from the cantilever backside within the fiber ; this interference signal is fed into the coupler ( see fig . [ interferometer ] ) .",
    "both the reference and the interference signal are fed into the balanced photo detector , which allows the dc part of the interference signal to be zero since it is subtracted from the interference .",
    "thus , the removal of the dc signal results in a wide dynamic span of an amplifier allowing an increase of the dc gain as well as the subtraction of dc laser fluctuations . the interference intensity measured by a photo detector is as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the laser power and @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath28 multiplied by the optical visibility of the system , @xmath14 is the fiber - cantilever distance , and @xmath15 is the wavelength of the laser .",
    "@xcite for a fixed wavelength , the intensity change due to the cantilever motion is the most sensitive when @xmath30 is close to a multiple of @xmath31 , because the variation in intensity due to the change of @xmath14 is maximum at these points : for example , @xmath19 is maximized when @xmath30 is a multiple of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we regulate the fiber - cantilever distance at these crossing points by the fiber piezo .",

    "[ vibration ] .",
    "a 20-ton concrete block resting on the heavy duty damping springs serves as the base for our system .",
    "three pneumatic legs standing on the concrete block carry a home - built triangular wooden table filled with lead bricks of 800 kg to further lower the system s resonance frequency .",
    "the @xmath0he cryostat insert is fixed on the table , and the dewar with a vector magnet moves up and down for experiments through the rectangular pit .",
    "we characterize the thermal noise level of our microscope as follows :  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath3 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are resonance frequency , boltzmann constant , temperature , measurement bandwidth , spring constant , quality factor , and oscillation amplitude , respectively . based on our typical operation parameters ( @xmath39 hz",

    "[ nb](a ) , varies by about @xmath46 n / m , which only deviates by a factor of 2 from the thermodynamic noise limit .",
    "additional noise fluctuations can be attributed to electrical noise , mechanical vibrations , and possible magnetic inhomogeneities at the measurement position .",
    "the mfm signal magnitude of an abrikosov vortex in the nb film [ black profile line in fig . [ nb](a ) ] exceeds the noise level by a factor of about 40 , which is comparable to the previous report .",

    "the images of abrikosov vortices obtained in a nb film highlight the vector magnet capability .",
