    "it is a well known fact that a schrdinger operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with a suitable periodic potential @xmath7 has gaps in its spectrum .",
    "this is a quite natural situation in solid state physics , where  for example in insulators  the particles described by the schrdinger operator have some unreachable energy regions ( gaps ) .",
    "this behaviour is ensured by the following two crucial properties : first , the fact that @xmath7 is periodic .",
    "this means that there is a basis @xmath8 of @xmath5 such that the potential satisfies @xmath9 in other words , the periodicity of @xmath7 introduces an action of the discrete abelian group @xmath10 on @xmath5 and the potential is completely specified on a fundamental domain @xmath11 .",
    "a typical example for a fundamental domain is the parallelepiped @xmath12 .",
    "second , the potential @xmath7 has a high barrier near the boundary of @xmath13 . in this way",
    ", the potential @xmath7 essentially decouples the fundamental domain @xmath13 from the neighbouring domains @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( see  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "a natural question in this context is whether one can replace the effect of the periodic potentials on the spectrum of the laplace operator by using geometry .",
    "specifically , can we replace @xmath5 with some riemannian manifold @xmath1 with a suitable discrete group action on it , such that the corresponding laplace operator @xmath0 also has gaps in its spectrum ( which is purely essential spectrum ) ?",
    "in other words , has @xmath16 more than one component as a subset of @xmath17 ?",
    "a positive answer to this question was given in the context of abelian groups in @xcite ( see also the references cited therein ) .",
    "the intuitive idea is that the junctions of the fundamental domains that build up @xmath1 are small enough ( see figure  [ fig : per - mfd ] below ) .",
    "this has a similar effect on the energy of the particles as the high barriers of the potential in the case of the schrdinger operator on @xmath5 .",
    "note that the case @xmath18 is uninteresting in our context since every laplacian on a one - dimensional ( non - compact ) riemannian manifold is unitary equivalent to the standard one , which has no gaps ( cf .",
    "moreover , for one - dimensional schrdinger operators any non - constant potential produces gaps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  xiii.91 ) .",
    "we will show in this paper that this simple idea of scaling down the junctions also works for many non - abelian discrete groups @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis in the non - abelian case is more involved because the structure of the dual object @xmath19 ( i.e. , the set of equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations of @xmath2 ) is less transparent from an algebraic and measure theoretic point of view .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to stress the fundamental ideas that allow to extend the previous result to non - abelian group actions .",
    "technical details and further developments will be published in  @xcite .",
    "we will not study the nature of the spectrum outside the gaps .",
    "some papers related to the problem of the band - gap structure of elliptic operators on covering manifolds are e.g.  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the schrdinger operator case , the present geometric setting allows the freedom to choose the dimension @xmath20 of the manifold and the number of `` period directions '' @xmath21 ( i.e. , number of generators of @xmath2 ) _ independently _ from each other .",
    "this observation can probably be useful in further investigations on spectral properties common for periodic schrdinger operators and laplacians on manifolds .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the following section we set up the problem , present the geometrical context and state some results that will be needed later . in section  [ sec : non - abelian ] we introduce in detail the non - abelian floquet theory , which is at the basis of our analysis",
    ". we will also illustrate the general formulas in the special case @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the next section",
    "we prove our main result : the existence of spectral gaps in the spectrum of @xmath0 for suitable manifolds @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : examples ] we specify a family of discrete groups , so - called groups of type  i , that satisfy the assumptions of our theorem .",
    "for convenience of the reader we have included in an appendix a short review of the main results concerning direct integral decompositions of unitary group representations .",

    "<S> motivated by the analysis of schrdinger operators with periodic potentials we consider the following abstract situation : let @xmath0 be the laplacian on a non - compact riemannian covering manifold @xmath1 with a discrete isometric group @xmath2 acting on it such that the quotient @xmath3 is a compact manifold . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the existence of a finite number of spectral gaps for the operator @xmath0 associated with a suitable class of manifolds @xmath1 with _ non - abelian _ covering transformation groups @xmath2 . </S>",
