    "the quark model predicts heavy baryons containing single , doubly or triply heavy charm or bottom quarks having either spin1/2 or spin3/2 .",
    "so far , all heavy baryons with single charm quark have been discovered in the experiments .",
    "some of the heavy baryons with single bottom quark like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 baryons with spin1/2 as well as @xmath5 baryon with spin3/2 have been observed in the experiments ( for a review see for instance @xcite ) . in 2012 ,",
    "the cms collaboration reported the observation of the @xmath6 state with spin3/2 @xcite . at present , among all possible doubly heavy baryon states only the spin1/2 @xmath7 charmed baryon have experimentally been observed by the selex collaboration @xcite .",
    "the experimental attempts , especially at lhcb , have still been continuing to complete the remaining members of the heavy baryons with one , two or three heavy quarks predicted by the quark model .    from the theoretical side",
    ", there are a lot of works in the literature devoted to the spectroscopy and decay properties of the heavy baryons containing single heavy quark .",
    "there are also dozens of works dedicated to the study of the properties of the doubly heavy baryons . however , there are limited numbers of works devoted to the investigation of the properties of the triply heavy baryons .",
    "the masses of the triply heavy baryons have been studied in framework of the various approaches such as effective field theory , lattice qcd , bag model , various quark models , variational approach , hyper central model , potential model and regge trajectory ansatz @xcite .",
    "the masses and residues of the triply heavy spin1/2 baryons for the ioffe current , as well as the masses of the triply heavy spin3/2 baryons , are also calculated in @xcite in framework of the qcd sum rule approach . in the present work ,",
    "we extend our previous work on the spectroscopy of the triply heavy spin1/2 baryons for the general form of the interpolating current @xcite to calculate the masses and residues of both positive and negative parity triply heavy spin3/2 baryons in framework of the qcd sum rules .",
    "we compare our results on the masses and residues of these baryons with the predictions of the existing approaches in literature @xcite .",
    "information on the masses of the triply heavy baryons can play essential role in understanding the heavy quark dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we derive qcd sum rules for the masses and residues of both negative and positive parity triply heavy spin3/2 baryons .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the sum rules for the masses and residues of the triple heavy baryons .",
    "this section contains also a comparison of the obtained results with the predictions of other approaches existing in literature .",
    "in order to calculate the masses and residues of the triply heavy spin3/2 baryons we start by the following two  point correlation function as the main object of the method : [ edhbtt01 ] _ ( q ) = i d^4x e^iqx 0 \\ { _ ( x ) |_(0 ) } 0  , where @xmath8 is the time ordering operator , @xmath9 is the four  momentum of the corresponding triply heavy baryon and @xmath10 stands for its interpolating current , whose general form can written as [ edhbtt02 ] _ = 1 ^abc \\{2 ( q^at c _ q^b ) q^c + ( q^at c _ q^b ) q^c }  , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are heavy quarks .",
    "the quark contents for all members of the triply heavy spin3/2 baryons are given in table 1 ."
