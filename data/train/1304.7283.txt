    "a0535@xmath626 belongs to a class of high mass systems , called be / x - ray binaries , known for having outbursts where matter accretes onto the magnetic poles via an accretion disk that is filled at periastron passage from a circumstellar decretion disk of the primary .",
    "when this stellar disk retreats , the accretion disk shrinks and the source enters quiescence .",
    "this allows the observer to study other source(s ) of accretion that may be present .",
    "@xcite have studied high mass systems in quiescence where the neutron star spin period is relatively short ( @xmath7 5 s ) , and they conclude that x - ray emission is due to material falling onto the magnetospheric boundary or burning on the neutron star surface .",
    "longer period high mass systems are less well studied .",
    "+    the x - ray intensity of a0535 + 26 varies by almost three orders of magnitude with three basic intensity states : 1 ) quiescence , 2 ) normal , or type i , outbursts , generally associated with periastron passages , and 3 ) giant , or type ii , outbursts that may occur at any orbital phase .",
    "the companion , hde245770 , has an equatorial circumstellar disk whose size has varied over time .",
    "it is this material that drives the normal outbursts at periastron .",

    "observations of the quiescent state have been performed by _ exosat , rxte , bepposax _ , and _ xmm - newton_. the source was observed four times by _ exosat _ between 1985 and 1986 and pulsations were detected during two of the observations @xcite .",

    "no significant flux was detected above @xmath020 kev , and therefore only data from pulse height channels 5 to 49 , corresponding to energies between @xmath03 and @xmath020kev , were used in the timing analysis ( see table  [ tab : obs ] for the comparative counting rates ) .",
    "for each observation the data were collected into consecutive 2 s time bins . with uniformly sampled and uninterrupted data , the lomb - scargle algorithm was applied over the frequency range of 0 to 0.020 hz ( periods greater than 50 s ) in 160 frequency steps ( approximately 1 s steps in period ) .",

    "the peak of the lomb - scargle plot for the middle observation was at 102.36 s. note that the lomb - scargle analysis assumes sinusoidal variations and gaussian noise , while the pulse profile of a0535@xmath626 is somewhat sinusoidal ( fig .",

    "epoch folding for those data was performed to validate the lomb - scargle analysis .",
    "an iterative epoch folding method was utilized whereby pulse - to - pulse changes in luminosity were taken into account by averaging the count rate over the pulse period and subtracting the resulting pulse averaged lightcurve from the original one .",

    "* ) , this 320 kev profile resembles the higher energy ( @xmath1615 kev ) ones in outburst with the broader minimum , as compared to lower energy ones with a narrow feature defining flux minimum .",
    "it also resembles many of the previous quiescent 210 kev profiles . the uncertainty in the epoch fold period for the 2011 july data is at the @xmath17-confidence limit and was determined by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the 2011 july pulse period is consistent with the detected pulse period of @xmath0103.25s @xcite during the last outburst in february 2011 , and considering that the pulse period changes relatively little during non - outburst times .",
    "it is surprising that the pulsations were only detected in the 2011 july observation , which has an intermediate flux of the three observations .",
    "even if the lack of a detection of pulsations in the last of the three observations could be attributed to insufficient statistics , the non - detection in the brightest observation remains a puzzle . with exposure roughly equivalent to the 2011 july observation and higher counting rate",
    ", one would expect it to have been more sensitive to pulsations .",
    "the energy spectra of all 3 observations are quite similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral_power ] ) , so the presence or lack of pulsations does not appear attributable to some kind of state change .",

    "these histograms are independent of the individualized data modes for a given observation .",
    "the pcu2 faint background estimate , provided by the pca team and based upon detector rates acquired while observing blank fields during the mission , was used in fitting of background subtracted data .",
    "the normalization of the background histogram depends upon the dead time estimate , which is also based upon average detector counting rates .",
    "the xspec recorn function was initially used to correct for the small difference between the estimated and actual pcu2 background normalization , which can not be measured directly due to the proportional counter array detectors being non - imaging . consequently the background must be modeled .",
    "comparison of results with and without the recorn function in the model showed that these data were insensitive to this background optimization , and thus results are given for fits without the recorn function included in the modeling .",
    "the two spectral models fitted to the three observations in the 320 kev range were an absorbed power law ( cflux*(tbabs*pegpwrlw ) ) and absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung ( cflux*(tbabs*bremss ) ) , both modified by a maximum in galactic line of sight absorption ( fixed at 4.5@xmath18 @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "cflux was the basis for the measurement of 210 kev flux plus 90% errors .",
    "the simple power law was used since the statistics did not warrant the use of a more complex model with a high energy cutoff , as utilized for fitting outburst spectra .",

    "this is due to the curvature of the bremsstrahlung spectrum with respect to that of a power law at low energies . above @xmath010 kev ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung spectrum rolls over with respect to the power law , but poor statistics at these energies preclude the determination of which model provides the better representation of the incident spectrum .",

    "a steeper power law would imply less compton up - scattering of lower energy photons due to either a thinning of the hot electon scattering plasma , or a cooling of the electron distribution .",
    "this may be further indication that the accretion mode is different between outburst and quiescence .    the pulse profile exhibited by the 2011 july 28 _ rxte _",
    "data is single peaked and somewhat sinusoidal , as has been seen in the past for observations made at quiescent luminosities , as noted above .",
    "_ cgro_/batse observations hint at a change in the pulse profile to the single peak variety that occurs below 10@xmath86 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this change from the double peaked structure of the outburst pulse profiles possibly indicates a change in the accretion regime . for low luminosities",
    "the beam pattern is expected to be more pencil beam - like , and more like a fan beam at higher luminosities ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "_ rxte _ observations of a0535@xmath626 months after a giant outburst were combined with three other sets of multiple observations of a0535@xmath626 from other x - ray observatories after other outbursts to reveal that they all had a similar ( within a factor of 2 ) , or slowly decreasing flux level .",
    "at least half of the observations detected pulsations , indicating that accretion onto the magnetic poles was still occurring , but perhaps intermittently .",
    "optical observations of h@xmath8 emission at the times of the measurements indicated that the 1998 and 2011 data were taken during times of a highly diminished be star disk , allowing for the possibility of sources of accreted material other than that responsible for the outbursts .",
    "when combining all 13 observations as a function of time since the last outburst ( albeit not the same outbursts ) , the quiescent flux appears to drop by a factor of 2 over 6.5 years , or @xmath87 @xmath88 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 with small ( @xmath89 ) flares or possible orbital variations present .",
    "based upon very limited statistics , the line - of - sight column density decreases by a factor of a few over the combined 6.5 years of quiescence , while the power law remained relatively constant .",
    "the quiescent flux and subsequent , correlated line of sight column depth could be due to a draining of material built - up at the corotation radius or due to spherical accretion from an isotropic , but diminishing , component of the stellar wind .",
    "further characterization of the quiescent mode of a0535@xmath626 will require more observations over a range of times since the last outburst in order to see if the slow downward trend in the flux continues , and to see if one could detect the orbital variations in flux expected for wind accretion in the eccentric orbit .",
