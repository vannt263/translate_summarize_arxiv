    "]    the electronic excitation spectra of molecular aggregates are significantly modified as compared to the isolated molecules that compose these aggregates .",
    "the main sources of the modifications are the coulomb coupling between electronic excitations , including both the frster @xcite and the dexter exchange @xcite interactions , formation of charge - transfer excitations or delocalized hole bands @xcite , and changes in the dielectric properties of the local environment .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the transition dipole moments , specifically the frster coupling , can be strong in pedot aggregates .",
    "the transition dipole scales approximately linearly with the number of monomers , reflecting a delocalization length of the electronic excitations over the length of the oligomer , see figure  [ fig : mon_scale](b ) . for a double - charged molecule composed of ten monomers",
    "the value of the transition dipole is about @xmath23  debye . for a more generalized characterization of the coulomb coupling between a pair of oligomers we computed the frster and dexter couplings as @xmath24 where the indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the homo and lumo orbitals of an @xmath27-th molecule @xcite . equation [ v_f ] describes the frster interaction beyond the dipole approximation as a coulomb transition between the initial @xmath28 and the final @xmath29 states of a two - oligomer system . in equation [ v_d ] ,",
    "the transition involves tunneling of electrons between oligomers , and this process requires an overlap of electronic wavefunctions . for all intermolecular distances relevant to our system , the dexter interaction between the molecules is less than @xmath30 of the frster coupling .",
    "figure  [ fig : f_map ] shows a map of the frster coupling as a function of the relative spatial positions of two 10-monomer oligomers .",
    "the negative sign of the frster coupling corresponds to the j - aggregation of the molecules , while the positive sign of the coupling indicates h - aggregation , with the sign of the coupling directly linked to the expected ordering and symmetry of the new j- or h - aggregated hybrid orbitals . in general , if the oligomers are aligned in parallel the excitonic coupling between the oligomers leads to a blue - shift of the collective absorption peak . only oligomers with a large relative displacement ( more than 2/3 of the oligomer length ) along the x - axis show j - aggregation in the absorption spectra , with a consequent red - shift of the absorption peak .",
    "it should be noted that due to delocalization of the electronic excitations the nearest neighbor frster interaction between oligomers decreases with the length of the chains,@xcite which may result in reduced frster coupling for sufficiently long chains .",
    "we observe this effect qualitatively , with a 10-monomer chain showing an interaction subtly reduced from the 8-monomer chain .",
    "however , at the short oligomer lengths determined in experimental characterizations of pedot : pss , we expect this effect to have only a minor effect .        in order to accelerate the computation of the electronic excitation spectra of aggregated oligomers",
    ", we treated the frster coupling beyond nearest neighbor interactions with an extended dipole model @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the effective dipole charge and @xmath33 is the distance between the @xmath27 charge on one oligomer and the @xmath34 charge on the another oligomer and @xmath35 is the coulomb constant .",
    "the frster interaction 2d map is used to calibrate the effective dipole charge as well as its length .",
    "this information together with a model of the structural arrangement of the oligomers is enough to construct the collective hamiltonian and the electronic absorption spectrum @xcite .",
    "charge transfer ( ct ) excitations in conducting polymers have been observed previously @xcite and analyzed theoretically @xcite .",
    "usually , the ct absorption line is red - shifted as compared to the intramolecular excitations .",
    "these transitions are allowed if there is a sufficient overlap between the electron wavefunctions of different oligomers .",
    "the lowest order term contributing to the ct transition in an oligomer dimer is due to the excitation from a homo orbital of one oligomer to a lumo orbital of another oligomer . for two parallel - stacked 10-monomer units displaced by @xmath1  nm the ct transition dipole , calculated as a matrix element of a dipole operator taken between homo and lumo orbitals of adjacent oligomers ,",
    "the interaction strength is @xmath36  d. this value is about one order of magnitude smaller that the transition dipoles for intramolecular excitations .",
    "previous theoretical studies of delocalized electronics states in p3ht also showed that the intensities of charge - transfer excitations are small compared to the intramolecular excitations @xcite .",
    "while we expect that the far infrared part of the absorption spectra of pedot aggregates will have significant contribution from ct excitations , the near infrared and visible parts of the absorption spectrum can be largely attributed to the coulomb interaction between the oligomers .",
    "in order to characterize the states delocalization we calculate the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , which is a standard measure of delocalization @xcite . for an exciton state of the form @xmath37",
    ", the ipr is defined as @xmath38 the ipr ranges from @xmath4 for a totally delocalized state state to @xmath19 for a totally localized state .",
    "below we plot the ipr as function of the square dipole strength , which determines the oscillator strength for each spectral feature , for different structures composed of 100 oligomers .",
    "the dipole strength is normalized by the single oligomer dipole strength , therefore it can range from zero for a completely dark state to 100 for a maximally bright state .",
    "a dipole strength of one corresponds to a single oligomer .",
    "the ipr ranges from @xmath39 to 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : singlechainipr ] shows the average ipr for 10,000 realizations of the single - chain arrangements with a maximum displacements of 1,5 and 9 ( from left to right ) .",
    "the error bars indicate the mean absolute deviation from the average .",
    "figure  [ fig : iprdouble ] shows the ipr for the double chain structure .",
    "a common feature between all structures is that the brightest states are more delocalized than the dark states .",
    "this trend includes the case of the single chain with a maximum monomer displacement of one . even though its ipr is quite flat compared to the other structures",
    ", there is a small slope for the bright states .",
    "as expected , we see also that disorder localizes the states . while the most ordered structure , the single chain with a maximum displacement of 1 , has a ipr around 0.02 , the others demonstrate ipr values that are much higher ."

    "<S> finally , we identify the degree of disorder potentially responsible for this transition and study the changes in localization of the bright and dark states , in order to better understand the character of the spectral peaks . as we show below , disorder tends to localized the states and bright states are more delocalized than the dark ones . as a model system , </S>",

    "<S> pedot - based materials consist of short oligomers , see figure  [ fig : struct](a ) , bound to counterions that balance the charges of oxidized pedot oligomers and affect the structural arrangement of the pedot oligomers . </S>",

    "<S> the physical reasoning behind the proposed packing begins with @xmath0 interactions that induce a parallel alignment of pedot oligomers and result in the formation of oligomer stacks . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic attraction to a backbone polyelectrolyte chain balances the self - repulsions from positive charge on the oligomers . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast with inorganic materials , the interactions mentioned above are relatively weak , frequently leading to high disorder in most conductive organic materials . </S>",
    "<S> this disorder influences both the optical spectra @xcite and the charge transport properties @xcite . for pedot - based materials </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify several specific types of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> first , the length and doping of each oligomer are not well controlled properties , resulting in a distribution of mesoscopic realizations and as a consequence , electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> second , in a pair or stack of pedot oligomers , each individual oligomer can be displaced relative to its neighbor along the length of the oligomer . </S>",
    "<S> finally , domains with different packing structures , and with a different relative oligomer orientation , can be formed on a larger scale . </S>",
    "<S> these structural variations affect both the material conductance and optical spectra @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> heavily doped pedot is mostly transparent to visible light . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has a very broad and structureless absorption spectrum below 1  ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this spectral feature is associated with the homo-1 to homo and also homo to lumo transitions of cation oligomers @xcite . as compared to isolated pedot oligomers , </S>",
    "<S> the absorption spectra of pedot aggregates are modified by the coulomb coupling between molecular excitations ( excitonic interactions ) @xcite as well as by charge tunneling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the relative alignment of the molecules , the excitonic interactions can result in the shift of the absorption peak to longer ( j - aggregation ) or shorter ( h - aggregation ) wavelengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many examples of j - aggregates can be found in nature , where aggregates of pigments play an essential role in light - harvesting and energy transfer in phototrophic organisms @xcite .    to predict and characterize optical properties of pedot aggregates we use a theoretical model , where single oligomer properties are computed using time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , while the emergent aggregate spectra are calculated based on a hubbard - type model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details of tddft calculations are provided in the supplementary information . as compared to previous theoretical studies of pedot optical spectra @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on the formation of small disordered clusters that include random displacements rather than a periodic crystalline orientation or arrangement of pedot oligomers on a polymer backbone . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> the role of structural disorder in the optical properties of pedot - based materials has not yet been explored in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation of pedot aggregates is driven by inter - oligomer forces . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2-@xmath2 interactions between the aromatic oligomers orients them face - to - face and fixes the perpendicular distance to @xmath1  nm as determined by x - ray scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energetic benefit of @xmath2-orbital overlap makes it energetically favorable for neighboring monomers to be cofacially aligned in a way that maximizes orbital overlap . using this tendency as a simplifying assumption , in our models we constrain the relative parallel displacement between oligomers to multiples of the monomer length . </S>",

    "<S> the analyzed structures are composed of around 100 oligomers , which is enough to saturate the spectral shifts related to the molecular arrangement size . in the cases where disorder is allowed , we average over 10,000 realizations , which is sufficient to obtain a wide sampling of the possible noise realizations . </S>",
    "<S> considering larger structures or averaging over more realizations introduces only minor changes in the results .        _ parallel stack of oligomers . _ as a first case , we studied a cofacially stacked column of 100 parallel oligomers as shown on [ fig : struct]b . </S>",
    "<S> perfectly aligned oligomers form an h - aggregate , with a blue - shifted spectrum relative to the single isolated oligomer . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of a constant parallel displacement between oligomers results in a transition from an h - aggregate behavior to j - aggregate behavior,@xcite see also supplementary information for more details . </S>",
    "<S> this change is reflected in the initial blue - shift reduction , which eventually turns into a red shift relative to the isolated oligomer as the constant displacement between neighboring oligomers is further enlarged . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , even at the maximum possible parallel displacement that maintains at least one monomer overlap , the lowest states do not contribute to the absorption spectra , in contrast to the case of a perfect j - aggregate . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyzed the effect of disordered or random parallel displacements that keep the monomers aligned and with at least a one monomer overlap . </S>",
    "<S> each realization consists of a disordered chain composed of 100 parallel oligomers , with a random parallel displacement between them . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : singledos ] shows the density of states ( dos ) and absorption spectra averaged over 10,000 realizations . to mimic structural disorder , </S>",
    "<S> we allow random displacements along the long axis of the oligomer over a range of amplitudes in both directions ( forward or backward ) up to a maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value for the lowest disorder level is a single monomer displacement . </S>",
    "<S> the low disorder level is reflected in the small widths of the dos and the absorption spectra ( see figure [ fig : singledos ] ) as wells as the spectral blue shift relative to the isolated oligomer . </S>",
    "<S> a low disorder chain is similar to the ordered case , with parallel arrangement resulting in a blue - shifted spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder level grows by increasing the maximum parallel displacement ( see figure [ fig : singledos]-insets ) . larger disorder results in broader spectra and dos , figure [ fig : singledos ] . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in the amplitude of random parallel displacements transforms the arrangement into a mixture of a parallel and a head - to - tail chain . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , this reduces the spectral blue - shift relative to the isolated oligomer , eventually becoming a red - shifted spectra as the maximum allowed displacement is further increased . in spite of this , these arrangements also fail to form a perfect j - aggregate , because the lowest states do not participate in the absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral shifting behavior also arises in more complex models . </S>",
    "<S> delocalization analysis clarifies the nature of the intense bands of the absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we calculate the inverse participation ratio @xcite and find that the bright states are consistently more delocalized than the dark states , independent of the oligomer displacement ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior also persists in more structurally complicated models . nevertheless , increasing the degree of disorder increases the localization independently of whether the state is dark or bright , as expected . to test our approach </S>",
    "<S> , we used the structural arrangement proposed in ref . for the pedot : pss micelles in a solid film , where the pedot oligomers form nanocrystals in the micelle core surrounded by pss counterions </S>",
    "<S> the pedot oligomers are arranged in two side - by - side stacks , where each stack is composed of a 13 cofacial oligomers . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : talspe ] shows the average spectra for the pedot nanocrystal for different disorder levels . similar to the previous model , augmenting the maximum parallel displacement , the spectrum is red shifted . </S>",
    "<S> the peak in the absorption spectrum of the most ordered case ( maximum displacement of a single monomer ) at around 0.6 ev is a consequence of the short length of the chains . for a completely ordered aggregate </S>",
    "<S> , this peak corresponds to the next odd delocalized excitation after the brightest state .        _ </S>",
    "<S> head to tail chains _ we next considered an arrangement consisting of two parallel chains @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : struct]c . </S>",
    "<S> each chain is composed of 50 oligomers in a head - to - tail arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> the two chains are cofacially stacked upon each other . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal inter - oligomer distance within a chain is limited by the van der waals radius , and the interchain distance is @xmath1  nm , the same as in the previous model .    </S>",
    "<S> we first considered two identical and perfectly aligned chains with a minimum distance between oligomers . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption spectrum is blue shifted relative to the single monomer spectrum . as we displaced one chain relative to the other , the blue - shifting is reduced , eventually evolving into a red - shifted spectrum , as seen above . </S>",
    "<S> a more complex model allows structural disorder due to a random degree of overlap between oligomers in the two cofacially stacked chains that preserves the following constraints : i ) facing monomers are aligned ; ii ) the minimal head to tail distance is @xmath3 ; iii ) chain continuity is ensured by requiring that every oligomer overlaps with two oligomers from the second chain . </S>",
    "<S> the randomness of alignment allows several arrangements and the results shown are the average over 10,000 realizations ( see figure [ fig : doublechain ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the single cofacial stack of oligomers , the red shifting for the head to tail pair of chains is larger and more narrow . also here , the lowest states contribute to the absorption spectra , in resemblance of a perfect j - aggregate . as in the single cofacial stack of oligomers </S>",

    "<S> again the lowest energy states of the dos are dark.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the insights obtained from the two basic models introduced earlier can help in the examination of the electronic structure of more elaborate arrangements . in order to demonstrate these insights we analyzed a 2d layer , as the one proposed in ref . for the condensed state of a vapor - phase polymerized pedot , where a 2d layer of pedot is `` sandwiched '' by 2d layers of pss counterions . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the pedot layer is composed of pairs of head - to - tail chains . </S>",
    "<S> the arrangement of the effective dipoles in the 2d layer is shown in figure [ fig:2dlayer ] . due to the disorder </S>",
    "<S> , nearest neighbors may be relatively far away from each other , therefore only extended dipole - dipole interactions are considered . </S>",
    "<S> each 2d layer is composed of 95 oligomers . the dos and absorption spectrum are shown in figure [ fig:2dlayer ] . </S>",
    "<S> this structure can be understood as a combination of the parallel oligomers chain and the head - to - tail chains models described above . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous models , there is a low energy peak in the dos . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this red shifted peak is the @xmath0 stacking of more head - to - tail chains that augments the total interaction , red shifting part of the dos . in agreement with our results on parallel stacks of oligomers above , the lowest states do not contribute to the absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this example shows how the intuitions obtained from simple models can be combined to analyze more intricate spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> a common feature of the studied models is the significant changes on the dos and absorption spectra caused by the introduction of structural disorder . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we showed that structural disorder is needed for reproducing the red shifted or low energy absorption spectra seen experimentally . nevertheless , in general the lowest states </S>",
    "<S> do not participate in the absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the only exception is the disordered head to tail stack of oligomers , which becomes a perfect j - aggregate in the sense that the lowest states contribute to the energy absorption ( see figure [ fig : doublechain ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thin films of pedot : pss show a broad , featureless absorption spectrum below 1 ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this spectral behavior is in contrast to that of the radical cations and dications in phenyl - capped pedot oligomers , as demonstrated via solution - phase spectroelectrochemistry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these solution phase measurements can be viewed as representative of the absorption spectra of isolated , un - aggregated pedot oligomers , essentially a starting point for building a thin film from a molecular building block . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations provide a guide to predict the thin film dos and optical properties from the properties of the component molecules . </S>",
    "<S> absorption features of the phenyl - capped oligomers showed the expected @xmath4 length dependence , and extrapolation of dication absorption features of shorter oligomers to the oligomers of length ten considered above suggest a bipolaron absorption feature at  1.2 ev . </S>",
    "<S> if disorder is not included , a net blue shift of 1 - 2 ev is predicted due to the coulomb interaction , in stark contrast to the experimentally observed thin film spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , inclusion of disorder faithfully reproduces a red shift of bipolaron spectral features , suggesting broad absorption at 1 ev and below in the thin film , as observed .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown the magnitude of structural disorder in the overlap between neighboring pedot oligomers in pi - pi stacked geometries has a significant impact on electronic absorption spectra . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the experimentally observed red - shifted absorption spectra relative to isolated pedot oligomers could only be obtained if structural order was introduced above a critical displacement . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conclude that in pedot : pss films , structural disorder is significant and has important contributions to both optical and electronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of structural models were considered and all showed the need for structural disorder in order to reproduce red - shifted spectra . finally , we point out that though x - ray scattering has provided important clues as to the nature of molecular packing in pedot materials , scattering measurements alone can not be used to differentiate between different models of structural disorder </S>",
    "<S> . electronic spectroscopy on whole films can provide additional clues , but the significant heterogeneous broadening of spectral features limits the utility of optical spectra </S>",
    "<S> . however , single - particle spectroscopy @xcite on individual polymer domains @xcite can potentially add significant new information on the structural and electronic properties of the pedot family of materials . </S>"
