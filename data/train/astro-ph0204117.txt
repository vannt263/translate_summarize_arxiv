    "the chemical composition of very metal - poor stars ( e.g. , [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) is believed to be determined by a small number of nucleosynthesis processes preceding the formation of these objects .",
    "abundance studies for these objects in the past decade have provided rich information for our understanding of individual nucleosynthesis processes in the early galaxy @xcite .",
    "the very metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 ) subgiant lp  625 - 44 shows extremely large overabundances of carbon , nitrogen and neutron - capture elements @xcite .",
    "this abundance property indicates the nucleosynthesis products in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage of low - mass or intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath8 , iben & renzini 1983 ) . since the evolutionary time - scale of these objects is long ( @xmath9m@xmath101 g year ) , the abundance pattern of lp  625 - 44 is not considered to originate in the gas cloud from which this object formed , but to reflect the yields of nucleosynthesis after this object has formed .",
    "one possible model to explain the abundances of this object is that involving mass transfer from a carbon - enhanced agb star ( one that has since evolved to the white dwarf stage and can not now be seen ) to its lower - mass companion , which is now observed as a carbon - rich object like lp625 - 44 .",
    "the binarity of this object was confirmed by radial - velocity monitoring @xcite , strongly supporting the above mass transfer scenario .",
    "this means that the nucleosynthesis process even in low - mass and intermediate - mass stars can also be studied by abundance analyses of such special metal - poor objects .",
    "the abundance pattern of the heavy neutron capture elements in lp  625 - 44 agrees well with that of solar system _",
    "s_-process elements @xcite",
    ". detailed abundance study of this star will give a strong constraint on _",
    "s_-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity and agb evolution in the early galaxy .",
    "recent modeling of agb stars by @xcite showed that neutron capture mainly occurs , not in the convective he shell _ during _ a thermal pulse , but in the radiative state _ between _ two given pulses . in this model the density distribution of the @xmath11c - rich layer ( referred to as the @xmath11c pocket ) , which provides neutrons for the _ s_-process , is taken as a free parameter .",
    "the yields of neutron - capture elements have been systematically calculated based on the stellar models by @xcite , who succeeded in reproducing at least the main component of the solar - system _ s_-process elements .",
    "the _ s_-process nucleosynthesis in the inter - pulse phases was also studied by goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) , who model the mixing process via a diffusion mechanism . on the other hand , quite recently , @xcite have found theoretically that the proton mixing into helium burning layer occurs _ during _ thermal pulses _ only in _ very metal - deficient ( [ fe / h ] @xmath122.5 ) agb stars ( see section 4.3 for details ) .",
    "this model predicts a large neutron exposure , and a different _ s_-process abundance pattern from those of the standard model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one issue to be studied for lp  625 - 44 is the lead ( pb ) abundance . the detection of pb in lp  625 - 44 by @xcite enables a comparison of the abundance pattern from sr ( @xmath13 ) to pb ( @xmath14 ) with predictions of agb models .",
    "the pb i line ( @xmath15 ) used in the above study has recently been detected in other three objects by @xcite .",
    "an important result of the work is that the pb of these three objects are much more abundant than the elements with @xmath16 ( e.g. , ce and nd ) , and the abundance ratios like ce / pb and nd / pb are significantly lower than those of lp  625 - 44 . this implies a large scatter in these abundance ratios which represent the production ratio of the elements at the second- to the third - peaks for _ s_-process at low metallicity . despite the importance of its pb abundance",
    ", the abundance analysis for pb in lp  625 - 44 relies only on the @xmath17 line ( the situation is the same for the other three objects ) .",
    "confirmation of the pb abundance by other lines is strongly desired .",
    "another issue concerning the chemical composition of lp  625 - 44 is the abundances of light elements .",
    "_ s_-process nucleosynthesis is dependent on the conditions of the burning layer in agb stars , which may be investigated by the resulting abundances of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and other light elements .",
    "a large excess of carbon and nitrogen , and moderate enhancement of magnesium have been revealed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other elements like oxygen ( o ) and sodium ( na ) are also useful to assess the nucleosynthesis processes which have contributed to the chemical nature of lp  625 - 44 .    for the study mentioned above , we obtained high resolution spectrum of lp  625 - 44 with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) of the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "the hds is an chelle spectrograph for the optical wavelength region ( 3000 - 10,000 ) located at one of the nasmyth foci of the telescope .",
    "hds successfully achieved its first - light in early july , 2000 .",
    "our spectra have been acquired in the first and second test observing runs for hds , and show the quality of the spectrograph , though some minor problems still existed in the early phases of performance verification .    in this paper , we study the characteristics of the abundances of the carbon- and _ s_-process - element - rich star lp  625 - 44 , comparing with the abundances of the metal - poor subgiant ( with normal abundance ratios ) hd140283 , which was also observed with similar setups of hds .",
    "we describe the observation , data reduction and calibration in some detail in section [ sec : obsana ] .",
    "the equivalent widths , intrinsic line widths and radial velocities are measured in that section . in section [ sec : ana ] , the analysis for absorption lines of the _ s_-process elements including pb i @xmath33683 and those of some light elements are described .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of the large excesses of some light elements including o and na , and the variation of abundance patterns for the _",
    "s_-process elements in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the observation has been made with subaru / hds in july and august , 2000 .",
    "the chelle grating of this instrument is a mosaic of two 31.6 gr / mm gratings , and the dispersion is 1   / mm at 4300   .",
    "the detector is a mosaic of two 4k@xmath182k eev ccd s with 13.5@xmath19 m pixels .",
    "we adopted a 0.4  arcsec ( 0.2  mm ) slit width which enables us to get spectra with resolution about 90,000 by about 3.5 pixels sampling .",
    "the high resolving power and high sampling rate are valuable in the study of the elemental lines affected by the isotope shifts or by blending with other atomic or molecular lines .",
    "we observed our two objects with both standard blue and red setups of the spectrograph as given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "another spectrum was also obtained with the uv setup ( 3100 - 4500   ) for hd140283 .",
    "it should be noted that the central wavelength range ( one order or two ) of each region can not be observed due to the gap ( @xmath201.1  mm ) between the two ccd s . while the free spectral range is completely covered by the blue setup , that is not the case in the wavelength region longer than 7200   in the red setup . a short - wavelength - cutoff filter ( sc46 )",
    "was used in the observations of red spectra .    in the observing runs in july and august 2000 ,",
    "the atmospheric dispersion compensator ( adc ) had not yet been installed .",
    "the image rotators were used because the target acquisition and guiding without image rotators had not yet been tested . in particular , the blue spectrum ( 3400 - 5100   ) of hd140283",
    "was obtained using the image rotator for the red setup , because the blue one was not available in the july run .",
    "we adopted the august data as the blue spectrum ( @xmath214500   ) for hd140283 . using the image rotator , the slit image on the sky",
    "was fixed to the pole direction , instead of the zenith direction , due to the requirement of guiding at that time .",
    "therefore the loss of light was significant in the short wavelength region in which the atmospheric differential dispersion is quite large .",
    "this limit in the observation resulted in the lower quality of the spectra for the short wavelength region ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we note that the adc for the nasmyth focus of the subaru telescope was installed in january 2001 .",
    "the throughput is better than that of image rotators for @xmath23 , and observing efficiency has improved compared to that in the observing runs when we obtained the data studied in this work .",
    "guiding without image rotators also became available after our observing runs .",
    "for flat fielding of the ccd data , we obtained halogen lamp data ( hereafter flat data ) with the same setup as that for object frames .",
    "however , we found in the july data that there was a significant disagreement of the continuum profile and the fringe pattern between the object spectrum and the flat one .",
    "the disagreement of the continuum profile is not serious for our abundance study because the analysis is usually made for normalized spectra , but the difference of the fringe pattern , which is remarkable in the red and near infrared ranges , directly affects our study of weak absorption features . by an investigation after the july run",
    ", we found that this problem was mainly due to the mis - alignment of the calibration system . in the august run , we fixed the problem and obtained the flat data again with the same setup as in the july run . using the new flat data ,",
    "the calibration quality has significantly improved , and the fringes have almost disappeared in our spectra .",
    "we note that the stability of the detector system including temperature control is fairly good , and the flat data obtained in different observing runs are applicable to data with the quality achieved in our study .      in the present data acquisition system of hds ,",
    "two fits formatted ccd data files are produced for one exposure corresponding to the two ccd s .",
    "these two files are reduced separately in this work .",
    "standard data reduction using the iraf _ echelle _ package was applied to each frame following the procedures mentioned below .",
    "hds data frames include a so - called `` over - scan region '' which represents the bias level of the frame . though the time variation of the bias level is not large in hds ( 1 - 2 e@xmath24 ) , we corrected the bias level by subtracting the average of the counts in the over - scan region for each frame .",
    "since there are two output points for each ccd , and the gains ( conversion factors ) are slightly different between them , the conversion from adu to the number of electrons was made corresponding to the output point .",
    "the dark current of the ccd is about 1e@xmath24 per hour , and is negligible in this study .",
    "however , some emission inside the nasmyth enclosure or leakage of light from the outside about 10  e@xmath24 per hour is known .",
    "this makes an almost homogeneous background in our object frames , and can be corrected by the background subtraction mentioned below .",
    "for this reason we have not acquired so - called dark frames in our observing runs .",
    "most cosmic - ray noise is excluded by comparing frames obtained by the same setup of the instrument . when more than three frames were acquired with the same setup , we replaced the count of a pixel by the median value of the all frames if the count of the individual frames is significantly higher than that of the median frame .",
    "when only two frames are available for the identical setup , we made a difference of the two frames , and replace the count of a pixel by that in another frame if the difference is significantly larger or smaller than zero .",
    "there are several distinctive so - called bad ( or hot ) columns in the ccd s , which align with the chelle dispersion direction .",
    "we excluded the wavelength regions of the spectra affected by these columns in the present analysis .",
    "the background subtraction was done by the _apscatter_ routine of iraf .",
    "the background level is about 2% of the stellar flux at 4000 for lp625 - 44 , and higher at shorter wavelength due to the decrease of the stellar flux .",
    "this background level is explained by reflections of the stellar light at the surface of the ccd and the field flattener lens just before the ccd .",
    "a comparison of the count level on the slit image and that of the inter - order region has shown that the sky contamination is negligible for our objects .    as mentioned in the previous subsection ,",
    "the calibration system was re - aligned after the july run , and the quality of flat - fielding has improved .",
    "however , the fringes in the longest wavelength range ( @xmath207800 ) can not necessarily be canceled out by flat fielding , because of the small variation of the fringe pattern amongst the object data .",
    "fringes can be the most severe source of noise in the spectrum for the long wavelength range .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done using the th - ar spectra obtained before and/or after the observations of the targets .",
    "the measured rms wavelength error of the weak th lines is less than 0.01 . by the measurement of the fwhm of weak th lines",
    ", we confirmed the spectral resolution as about 90,000 .",
    "the ccd covers the spectrum of each order much wider than the free spectral range in the uv - blue region .",
    "we trimmed the wavelength range where the count level is too low ( typically lower than 1/4 of the peak of the chelle blaze profile ) from the spectrum of each order to reduce the noise included in the region with low - count level .    for continuum specification , we first made blaze profiles of individual chelle orders using the flat data .",
    "the stellar spectra were divided by these blaze profiles , and the continuum was traced using iraf _continuum_ routine .",
    "the continuum specification is still difficult for the regions around broad absorption lines ( e.g. , balmer lines ) and strong molecular bands ( e.g. , ch g - band ) , but they are not important for the present analysis focusing on rather weak lines .    the s / n ratio of each spectrum , simply estimated from the count level , is given in the last column of table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "this value is the s / n ratio per pixel ( 0.012 at 4000 and 0.018 at 6000 ) at the peak of the chelle blaze profile .",
    "the s / n ratio at the edge of the chelle blaze function is lower than the center .",
    "however , the free spectral range is well covered for most regions , and the s / n ratio is not severely dependent on the line position in the chelle order after combining the spectra for neighboring orders .      for the standard analysis which was applied to most elements ,",
    "equivalent widths were measured by fitting gaussian profiles to the absorption lines .",
    "we excluded lines which may be significantly affected by other absorption lines .",
    "the blending with other atomic or molecular lines was checked using the atomic line list by @xcite and molecular line lists of ch , cn and c@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the spectral lines which are too broad compared to the lines with similar strength are also excluded to avoid possible blending with unknown line absorption .",
    "the line list including the equivalent widths measured is given in table  [ tab : ew ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : ew ] , the equivalent widths of fe i measured in the present work are compared with those of @xcite and @xcite for hd140283 , and those of @xcite for lp625 - 44 .",
    "the agreement is fairly good between our measurement and that of @xcite .",
    "the agreement between our data and those by @xcite is also good for weak lines which are important for abundance determination , though our equivalent widths of strong lines are slightly ( @xmath205% ) smaller than theirs . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion in the diagram for lp  625 - 44 is larger than the dispersion in those for hd  140283 .",
    "this should be due to the lower s / n ratios of the lp625 - 44 spectrum than that of the hd140283 one in both studies , and may also be due to the effect of unidentified blending , because the lines are very crowded in lp  625 - 44 due to the overabundances of carbon , nitrogen and neutron - capture elements .",
    "thanks to the high resolving power of hds ( @xmath26 km  s@xmath27 ) , the instrumental line broadening is sometimes smaller than the intrinsic widths of metal lines due to the motion of the photospheric gases ( macro - turbulence ) and/or stellar rotation .",
    "we plot the widths of fe i lines observed against their central depths in figure [ fig : line ] .",
    "the width in the figure indicates the gaussian dispersion in velocity units ( km  s@xmath28 ) converted from the fwhm and corrected for instrumental broadening for which we assumed a gaussian profile .",
    "we excluded the lines whose central depths are shallower than 0.1 because their quality is not good .",
    "then we determined the optically thin limit of the line width by extrapolating the plots to zero central depth .",
    "this thin limit can be interpreted as the intrinsic line width .",
    "the thermal broadening for our objects ( @xmath295500k ) is about 1.8  km  s@xmath30 , and the micro - turbulent velocity is 1.2  km  s@xmath30 ( see section [ sec : ana ] ) . correcting for these broadening",
    ", the macroscopic broadening is estimated to be 5.5 and 7.4  km  s@xmath30 for hd140283 and lp625 - 44 , respectively .",
    "we expect that the rotation of these old subgiants is slow , and the broadening represents the macro - turbulence in the atmosphere .",
    "however , as found in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : line ] for lp625 - 44 , the scatter in the widths of weak lines is large , and there seems to be an influence of blending on some weak lines .",
    "since this object shows remarkable overabundances of carbon , nitrogen and neutron - capture elements , blending with absorption lines of molecules and heavy elements is a significant problem .",
    "we tried an independent estimation of the line broadening for a rather strong and clean fe i line ( @xmath34143.87 ) by fitting a synthetic spectrum ( figure  [ fig : fe1 ] ) .",
    "the stellar parameters used for the calculation are given in next section .",
    "we assumed a single gaussian broadening here .",
    "this assumption is expected to be enough to estimate the broadening for the following analysis , though that may not represent the broadening process of the real atmosphere .",
    "this analysis showed that line broadening of 7.4  km  s@xmath30 seems to be an overestimate , but about 6.5  km  s@xmath30 is acceptable .",
    "we adopted the later as the macro - turbulence of lp625 - 44 .",
    "we estimate here for completeness the effect of blending on measurement of equivalent widths . if the discrepancy in the measured macro - turbulence from figure [ fig : line ] and that from the fe ii @xmath34143 line is due to blending with other lines , that also results in the overestimate of equivalent widths for the weak fe i lines used in the abundance analysis , and then the derived iron abundances .",
    "the effect is about 15% ( 0.06 dex ) for some weak lines , and that does not make large impact on the abundance determination .",
    "variation of radial velocity has been detected for lp  625 - 44 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates the binarity , and strongly supports the mass transfer scenario as an explanation for the overabundances of carbon and _",
    "s_-process elements in this star .",
    "since one period of the variation has not yet been covered in the monitoring , further measurements of radial velocity are indispensable to determine the orbital parameters for this object .    for the measurement of radial velocity , we selected clean fe i lines in each spectrum , and measured the line position by fitting gaussian profiles , and then derived the heliocentric velocity .",
    "results are given in table [ tab : rv ] , along with the standard error in each measurement and the julian day ( jd ) of the observation .",
    "we note that the th - ar comparison data were not acquired before nor after the hd140283 observing on 18 august run , so a reliable radial velocity could not be derived from that spectrum .    the results from the two measurements for hd  140283 agrees very well .",
    "no variation of radial velocity is known for this object , and our results are reasonable .",
    "the radial velocities of lp  625 - 44 ( 30.2 and 30.9  km@xmath28 ) are almost consistent with the result ( 30.0  km@xmath28 ) for jd=2451569.8 @xcite .",
    "the variation of radial velocity for this object is expected to be small for about 200 days , and the results are also reasonable .",
    "an abundance analysis using model atmospheres in the atlas grid of @xcite was made for our two metal - poor objects .",
    "while a standard analysis based on equivalent widths was carried out for most elements , a spectrum synthesis technique was applied to molecular bands ( ch , cn and c@xmath25 ) and atomic lines which are affected by blending and/or line splitting ( hyperfine splitting and isotope shifts ) . in this section ,",
    "we describe the procedures and results of the abundance analysis .",
    "the parameters of model atmospheres used in the abundance analysis are effective temperature ( @xmath31 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath32 ) , micro - turbulent velocity ( @xmath33 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] is adopted as metallicity ) .",
    "once these parameters are given , the equivalent width is calculated for assumed elemental abundances for each line whose lower excitation potential ( @xmath34 ) and transition probability ( @xmath35 ) are known .",
    "we determine the abundance from the comparison of the calculated equivalent widths with observed ones .",
    "there are other parameters of line broadening like macro - turbulence for the spectrum synthesis method .",
    "the effective temperatures have been determined by @xcite and @xcite for lp625 - 44 ( 5500k ) and hd140283 ( 5750k ) , respectively .",
    "these are based on their color ( @xmath36 ) , and we adopted these values in this analysis .    for a check of the effective temperature",
    ", we investigated the correlation between the lower excitation potential and the resulting abundances for fe i lines ( figure [ fig : teff ] ) .",
    "the middle panel of this figure shows the correlation for the effective temperature adopted in this analysis .",
    "though the abundances resulting from high excitation lines ( @xmath37  ev ) are higher than those from low excitation ( @xmath38  ev ) , the discrepancy is not significant ( @xmath20 0.2  dex ) .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the same ones for @xmath39 and 5750  k , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the abundances are derived using @xmath33 re - determined for each case , instead of the @xmath33 derived in the analysis for @xmath40k .",
    "the dependence of resulting abundances on the lower excitation potential slightly changes , but the effect of the change of effective temperature is not large .",
    "this is probably because the effect of effective temperature is partly canceled out by the re - determination of @xmath33 , because the equivalent width is strongly dependent on the excitation potential of the line ( lines with low excitation potential are usually strong , while high excitation lines are usually weak ) .",
    "this implies that the correlation between excitation and resulting abundance does not give a strong constraint on the determination of effective temperature for this object .",
    "we note there is another difficulty in the estimation of effective temperatures from the relation between excitation and resulting abundance due to the uncertainty in the treatment of damping @xcite .",
    "the surface gravity was determined to obtain ionization balance between fe i and fe ii lines , and also between ti i / ti ii .",
    "the final derived gravities are @xmath41 3.3 and 2.5 for hd  140283 and lp  625 - 44 , respectively .",
    "the micro - turbulent velocities were determined from the fe i lines by demanding no dependence of derived abundance on equivalent widths .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : micro ] .",
    "the result is 1.2  kms@xmath28 in both objects .",
    "these values agree rather well with those derived by previous works @xcite .    the random errors in standard analysis for fe and ti , which include errors in equivalent width measurements and uncertainties of _ gf_-values , are about 0.1  dex or smaller .",
    "these errors result in the uncertainties of about 0.3  dex in @xmath42 and of 0.3  km  s@xmath28 in micro - turbulent velocities .",
    "we estimate the errors of the abundances caused by the uncertainties in stellar parameters in section [ sec : uncert ] .",
    "the surface gravity of hd  140283 was measured by @xcite based on the hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "their result is @xmath43 , rather higher than the value derived from the ionization balance by some spectroscopic studies including our present work .",
    "the difference between the @xmath42 of @xcite and ours ( 0.4  dex ) is comparable to the uncertainty of @xmath42 in this work ( 0.3  dex ) , but the discrepancy may be due to the non - lte effect , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the neutron capture elements of lp  625 - 44 were studied by @xcite in detail .",
    "we re - analyzed the abundances for most elements using the line lists produced by that work for new spectrum .",
    "the effect of hyperfine splitting and isotope shifts were included for the lines of ba , la , pr , nd , sm , eu and pb . the effect seems very small in ce lines , and that was neglected : see @xcite for details of the line lists and analysis .",
    "here we discuss some new lines of neutron capture elements which were not studied by the previous work .",
    "we inspected carefully the spectrum of hd140283 , but could not find distinct absorption feature of neutron capture elements except for sr , y , zr and ba .",
    "since the pb abundance derived by @xcite and @xcite is based on the @xmath17 line alone , confirmation of the abundance from other lines is desirable . in the solar spectrum ,",
    "four pb i lines have been identified at 3639.5 , 3683.4 , 3739.9 and 4057.8  @xcite .",
    "two of them ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) are found in our new spectrum of lp  625 - 44 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pb ] shows the observed spectrum at the wavelength of these two lines with the synthetic spectra . in the calculation of the spectra , the effects of isotope ( @xmath46pb , @xmath47pb , @xmath48pb and @xmath49pb ) shifts and hyperfine splitting for @xmath48pb are taken into account .",
    "the line positions taken from @xcite are shown for each component in the figure .",
    "we assumed the solar system isotope ratio for pb in this analysis .",
    "the upper panel of this figure shows the same line ( @xmath50 ) at the top panel of figure 2 in @xcite , and the resulting abundance of this work ( @xmath51 ) agrees with the previous result .",
    "one advantage of our spectrum is its higher spectral resolution and finer sampling .",
    "that makes it possible to investigate the effect of hyperfine structure and isotope shifts on the line profile which do not clearly appear in the spectrum studied by the previous work .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : pb ] indicates the synthetic spectrum calculated by single - line approximation for @xmath51 .",
    "even if a higher pb abundance is assumed , the single - line approximation can never reproduce the wide absorption feature at 4057.8 . though the assumption of the solar isotope ratio is adequate to derive the pb abundance , more detailed analysis for this line using a higher quality spectrum may provide some information on the isotope ratios and give constraints on pb production .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : pb ] shows the newly detected pb i line at 3683.5 .",
    "though the quality of the spectrum at this wavelength is poorer than at 4057 , the analysis is easier because blending is not severe ; this line is clearly seen even in the solar spectrum .",
    "we note that the broad absorption in the shorter wavelength region is the wing of the hydrogen line ( h20 ) at 3682.8 .",
    "the abundance derived from this line ( @xmath52 ) agrees well with that from the @xmath50 line , confirming the pb abundance derived by the previous works .",
    "the effect of isotope shifts and hyperfine splitting was also included in this analysis , but the effect is less remarkable for this line , as shown in the figure .",
    "dysprosium ( dy , @xmath53 ) and erbium ( er , @xmath54 ) have already been detected by @xcite in lp  625 - 44 , but the number of lines studied was quite limited . in our hds spectrum",
    ", several new lines have been discovered in the wavelength range 3600 - 3700   .",
    "we analyzed these lines using the transition probabilities taken from @xcite and @xcite for dy ii and er ii , respectively .    in our new spectrum of lp  625 - 44 ,",
    "the ytterbium ( yb , @xmath55 ) ii @xmath56 line has been detected .",
    "we tried to derive the abundance by spectrum synthesis adopting the line data used in @xcite . since there is no useful data on hyperfine splitting , at least to our knowledge , the effect was not included in the analysis .",
    "this may cause a significant overestimate of the abundance , because this element has seven stable isotopes , and two of them ( @xmath57yb and @xmath58yb ) have odd neutron number .",
    "the yb abundance derived above by single line approximation is much higher than those of er ( @xmath54 ) and hf ( @xmath59 ) , but we suspect this is not real and due to the effect of the line splitting .",
    "the carbon abundance of lp  625 - 44 was derived from the ch ( @xmath34323 ) band by @xcite .",
    "we first applied these analyses to our two objects .",

    "the important result here is that the oxygen abundance of lp  625 - 44 is obviously much higher ( perhaps by nearly 1.0  dex ) than that of hd  140283 .",
    "figure [ fig : na ] shows the observed spectra around the na i lines . the na i d lines in lp  625 - 44 are clearly stronger than those of hd  140283 ( lower panel ) , and the doublet lines with higher excitation around 5685 , which do not appear in hd  140283 , are detected in lp  625 - 44 .",

    "the oxygen abundance of hd  140283 was studied by @xcite .",
    "their result derived from the o i triplet lines adopting @xmath31=5694  k , which is similar to ours , is [ o / fe]=+0.86 , and the agreement is fairly good .",
    "there is no systematic difference between the abundances of neutron capture elements derived here and those by @xcite for lp  625 - 44 .",
    "the discrepancies are rather large ( 0.3 - 0.4  dex ) in dy , er and hf . the numbers of lines studied by @xcite for these elements were quite limited .",
    "we expect the present study improves the abundance determination for these elements by increasing the number of lines used in the analysis .",
    "the carbon and nitrogen abundances derived here for lp  625 - 44 agree with those by @xcite within the uncertainties .    for other elements of lp  625 - 44 , we found generally good agreement between the abundances derived here and those by @xcite .",
    "exceptions are sc and ni , for which @xcite derived by 0.8 - 0.9  dex higher abundances than ours .",

    "we suspect that the previous results were affected by blending , and believe our new result is more reliable than that by the previous work .",
    "figure 10 shows the results of abundance analysis for hd140283 ( open boxes ) and lp 625 - 44 ( filled circles ) .",
    "these two subgiants are known to have quite similar stellar parameters to each other . since hd 140283 is a `` normal '' metal - poor subgiant which represents the typical abundance pattern shared by the other metal - poor subgiants , it is of great interest to compare the abundance pattern of lp 625 - 44 with that of hd 140283 in order to identify several specific characteristics of this object .",
    "a glance at this figure tells us that the abundance ratios [ x / fe ] in lp 625 - 44 are generally higher than those in hd 140283 , except for the elements which have 20 @xmath75 28 .",

    "goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) have recently carried out a parametric study of the _",
    "s_-process nucleosynthesis including the production of the light elements .",
    "their model adopts one parameter of partial mixing of protons from the hydrogen - rich envelope into the carbon - rich layers during the third dredge - up .",

    "they studied the efficiency of producing the light elements and the _",
    "s_-process elements by adopting various proton abundances in the partial mixing zone .",
    "when the proton mixing is extremely strong ( @xmath78 in their model ) , hydrogen burning occurs in the @xmath79c - rich and @xmath2ne - rich layer , and produces large overabundances of @xmath80n and @xmath81na as shown in figure 1 in goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) .",
    "the expected process for the production of enriched @xmath81na in lp 625 - 44 is the proton capture by @xmath2ne , i.e. @xmath2ne(@xmath82)@xmath81na .",
    "however , if this is the case , the hydrogen burning does not produce @xmath11c efficiently in order to provide enough free neutrons for the _ s_-process .",
    "this leads to a difficulty in finding strongly enhanced _",

    "the moderately proton - rich case ( @xmath83 ) is likely to explain large @xmath11c excess , which can provide enough neutrons for the _",

    "moderate enhancement in @xmath77o and @xmath84 mg are expected , which is in reasonable agreement with the abundances derived from our analysis of lp 625 - 44 .",
    "having these discussions , we are now forced to speculate that the abundance pattern of lp 625 - 44 may be explained in the hybrid model which exhibits both a high proton - density zone and a moderate proton - density zone . physical processes which induce the proton mixing are still unknown , although diffusion effects and stellar rotation are possible candidates ( goriely & mowlavi 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "our result gives a new , strong constraint on such types of proton mixing models of the agb evolution .",

    "we discuss in this subsection the ratios of the abundances of the second - peak elements to the abundance of pb , which have shown a large difference among several recently observed _ s_-process - element - rich stars .",
    "we here define an average abundance ratio of elements in the second _ s_-process peak to those in the third _ s_-process peak by [ hs / pb ] = ( [ la / fe]+[ce / fe]+[nd / fe])/3 @xmath85 [ pb / fe ] , where hs means heavy _",

    "we plot the [ hs / pb ] values as a function of metallicity [ fe / h ] for all these five stars in figure 11 .",
    "although the sample of metal - poor , _ s_-process element - rich stars is still too small to infer some definite conclusion , one speculative possibility is that a different nucleosynthesis condition might produce a large scatter in the abundance ratios of _",

    "since the neutron exposure in the _ s_-process in agb stars depends strongly on this parameter , a large scatter in [ hs / pb ] may result from different conditions of the adopted parameter values although the mechanism of proton mixing is unknown in their models .",
    "another possibility arises from the speculation that there are at least two types of nucleosynthesis processes to give rise to different abundance ratios [ hs / pb ] @xmath860.4 ( for lp 625 - 44 and lp 706 - 7 ) and @xmath851.2 ( for hd187861 , hd224959 , and hd196944 ) .",
    "quite recently , @xcite have found theoretically that the proton mixing into helium burning layer occurs at thermal pulses only in very metal - deficient ( [ fe / h ] @xmath122.5 ) agb stars .",
    "this kind of mixing is prevented by the large entropy barrier between the helium - rich zone and the hydrogen - rich envelope in the stars with higher metallicity @xcite .",
