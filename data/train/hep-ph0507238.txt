    "studies of the evolution of a @xmath9 or @xmath10 into the respective anti - particle , a @xmath11 or @xmath12  @xcite , have guided the form and content of the standard model and permitted useful estimates of the masses of the charm  @xcite and top quark  @xcite prior to their direct observation .",
    "neutral flavor oscillation in the @xmath13 meson system is highly suppressed within the standard model and , thus , with current experimental sensitivity , searches for @xmath14-@xmath5 mixing constitute a search for new physics .",
    "in addition , improving constraints on charm mixing is important for elucidating the origin of @xmath15 violation in the bottom sector .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath14-@xmath5 system is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath16 where the * m * and @xmath17 matrices are hermitian , and @xmath18 invariance requires @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of these matrices describe the dispersive or long - distance and the absorptive or short - distance contributions to @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing .",
    "we define the neutral @xmath13 meson mass eigenstates to be @xmath21 , and , following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath22 is the @xmath15-odd state , and @xmath23 is the @xmath15-even state , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the masses and decay widths , respectively , and @xmath28 a @xmath14 can evolve into a @xmath5 through on - shell intermediate states , such as @xmath29 with mass @xmath30 , or through off - shell intermediate states , such as those that might be present due to new physics .",
    "this evolution through the former ( latter ) states is parametrized by the dimensionless variables @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "we adopt the conventional definitions of these mixing parameters : @xmath33 the mixing probability , @xmath34 , is approximately @xmath35  @xcite . for hadronic flavored final states ,",
    "the above time evolution is also governed by the relative magnitudes and phases between cabibbo - favored ( cf ) and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) amplitudes , generically denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "standard - model - based predictions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as well as a variety of non - standard - model expectations , span several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "several non - standard models predict @xmath40 .",
    "contributions to @xmath38 at this level could result from the presence of new particles with masses as high as 1001000  tev  @xcite .",
    "the standard model short - distance contribution to @xmath38 is determined by the box diagram in which two virtual quarks and two virtual @xmath41 bosons are exchanged .",
    "next - to - leading order calculations show that the short distance contributions to @xmath38 and @xmath39 are expected to be comparable  @xcite .",
    "long - distance effects are expected to be larger but are difficult to estimate .",
    "it is likely that @xmath38 and @xmath39 contribute similarly to mixing in the standard model .",
    "measurement of the phase @xmath42 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix  @xcite is challenging and may eventually be limited by experimental constraints on charm mixing  @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed using @xmath43 decays : the gronau - london - wyler ( glw )  @xcite method , where the @xmath13 decays to @xmath15 eigenstates ; the atwood - dunietz - soni ( ads )  @xcite method , where the @xmath13 decays to flavor eigenstates ; and the dalitz - plot method  @xcite , where the @xmath13 decays to a three - body final state .",
    "uncertainties due to @xmath13 decays contribute to each of these methods .",
    "the cleo - c physics program  @xcite includes a variety of measurements that will improve the determination of @xmath42 from the @xmath44-factory experiments , babar and belle  @xcite .",
    "the pertinent components of this program are : improved constraints on charm mixing amplitudes ( important for glw ) , first measurement of the relative strong phase @xmath45 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 decay to @xmath46 ( important for ads ) , and studies of charm dalitz plots tagged by hadronic flavor or @xmath15 eigenstates .",
    "the total number of charm mesons accumulated at cleo - c will be much smaller than the samples already accumulated by the @xmath44-factories .",
    "however , the quantum correlation of the @xmath1 system near threshold provides a unique laboratory in which to study charm .    the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be measured in a variety of ways .",
    "the most precise constraints are obtained by exploiting the time - dependence of @xmath13 decays  @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to measure @xmath38 and @xmath39 include : measurements of the wrong - sign semileptonic branching ratio @xmath47  @xcite , which is sensitive to @xmath34 ; decay rates to @xmath15 eigenstates @xmath48 and @xmath49  @xcite , which are sensitive to @xmath39 ; the wrong - sign @xmath50 hadronic branching ratio  @xcite , which is sensitive to @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; wrong - sign @xmath53  @xcite and @xmath54  @xcite decays ; and the decay rate of @xmath55@xcite , which determines @xmath56 from a dalitz - plot analysis and measures @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "time - dependent analyses are not feasible at cleo - c ; however , previous authors have found that the quantum - coherent @xmath57 state  @xcite provides time - integrated sensitivity , through the interference between amplitudes for indistinguishable final states , to @xmath39 at @xmath58 and to @xmath59 at @xmath60 in 1  fb@xmath61 of data at the @xmath62  @xcite . in this paper , we extend the work of refs .",
    "@xcite and develop a method for simultaneously measuring @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . unlike the proposed measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not rely on external estimates of the relevant @xmath4 branching fractions .",
    "our method is a modified version of the double tagging technique originally developed to measure @xmath13 branching fractions at the @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we make use of rates for exclusive @xmath1 combinations , where both @xmath13 final states are specified ( known as double tags or dt ) , as well as inclusive rates , where either the @xmath4 or @xmath5 is identified and the other neutral @xmath13 decays generically ( known as single tags or st ) .",
    "although we estimate that cleo - c will not have sufficient sensitivity to observe standard model charm mixing ( see section  [ sec : experiment ] ) , it should be able to achieve a precision comparable to current experimental results .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper can also be applied to coherent @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 systems , although with some additional complications .",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we consider the following categories of @xmath4 and @xmath5 final states :    * @xmath63 or @xmath64 : hadronic states that can be reached from either @xmath4 or @xmath5 decay but that are not @xmath15 eigenstates .",
    "an example is @xmath65 , which is produced via cf @xmath4 transitions or dcs @xmath5 transitions .",
    "we include in this category cabibbo - suppressed ( cs ) transitions as well as self - conjugate final states of mixed @xmath15 , such as non - resonant @xmath66 . * @xmath67 or @xmath68 : semileptonic or purely leptonic final states , which , in the absence of mixing , tag unambiguously the flavor of the parent @xmath13 . * @xmath69 or @xmath70 : @xmath15-even and @xmath15-odd eigenstates , respectively .",
    "all @xmath4 decay modes can be treated uniformly if we enumerate charge - conjugate final states separately , indexed by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , @xmath65 and @xmath73 are labeled by @xmath71 and @xmath46 and @xmath74 by @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath15 eigenstates appear in both lists because @xmath75 .",
    "we define the mode - dependent amplitude ratio @xmath76 , with @xmath77 where the phase of @xmath78 results from our @xmath15 convention .",
    "since @xmath79 in the charm sector is trivial ( 0 or @xmath78 ) , @xmath80 corresponds to either @xmath81 ( if @xmath71 is cf ) or @xmath82 ( if @xmath71 is cs ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath15 is conserved , then @xmath83 . to resolve the ambiguity of whether to identify any given final state as @xmath71 or @xmath72",
    ", we choose @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath38 and @xmath39 have both been constrained to be less than @xmath58  @xcite , we generally keep terms only to leading order in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we denote decay amplitudes by @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in our phase convention ,",
    "@xmath15 conjugate amplitudes are given by @xmath87 we use a normalization in which @xmath88 is the @xmath89 branching fraction in the absence of mixing .",
    "if mixing is present , then the branching fractions for an isolated neutral @xmath13 meson produced in a @xmath4 or @xmath5 flavor eigenstate become  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the total @xmath4 decay rate is unaffected by mixing , so @xmath94 if the deviation of @xmath95 from unity is parametrized by two small @xmath15-violating parameters ( magnitude and phase ) , then these parameters only appear in products with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; they can only modulate the strength of the mixing signal .",
    "therefore , below , we assume @xmath96 and also that @xmath15 is conserved in the decay amplitudes ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath97 ) , which allows @xmath39 to be expressed in terms of @xmath88 : @xmath98 where we have accounted for the fact that @xmath99 modes are simultaneously labeled by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "table  [ tab : rdelta ] lists the values of @xmath100 and @xmath80 for each final state category .",
    ".values of the amplitude ratio magnitudes @xmath100 and phases @xmath80 , as well as uncorrelated branching fractions , for each final state category , to first order in @xmath38 and @xmath39 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one important source of systematic uncertainty not included above is the purity of the initial @xmath101 state .",
    "the sample composition can be determined from the ratios @xmath102 assuming @xmath15 is conserved .",
    "thus , if we include the forbidden @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 dt yields that were previously omitted , then we can construct every other st or dt yield as a sum of @xmath0-odd and @xmath0-even contributions , with their relative sizes constrained by equation  [ eq : relativeccontributions ] . in this way",
    ", the systematic uncertainty is absorbed into the statistical uncertainties , and the @xmath0 content of the sample is self - calibrating . if the fit is performed on pure samples , with either @xmath106 or @xmath107 measured to be consistent with zero , then the uncertainties given in table  [ tab : sensitivity ] suffer no degradation . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath108 , then there is an unfortunate cancellation of terms containing @xmath109 or @xmath39 , and these parameters can not be determined at all .    to demonstrate the importance of semileptonic modes in this analysis",
    ", we consider a variation on the above fits .",
    "if no semileptonic yields are measured , then , for @xmath0-odd there is only one independent combination of @xmath110 , @xmath109 , and @xmath39 : @xmath111/(1 + r_f^2 + r_f z_f y ) \\approx",
    "r_f z_f + y$ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if only the @xmath112 dt modes are omitted , then @xmath39 and @xmath109 can be determined separately but with uncertainties approximately 50% larger than those in table  [ tab : sensitivity ] , where the @xmath112 dt modes are included .",
    "the @xmath113 and @xmath114 dt modes improve the uncertainties on @xmath115 and @xmath116 , but not on @xmath39 and @xmath109 . however ,",
    "if the self - calibrating fit described above were performed without these modes , then @xmath110 would be strongly coupled to @xmath115 and @xmath109 [ through @xmath117 , resulting in inflated uncertainties . in order to stabilize the fit",
    ", it would be necessary to fix the value of @xmath115 .",
    "experimental constraints on charm mixing are usually presented as a two - dimensional region either in the plane of @xmath118 versus @xmath119 or in the plane of @xmath38 versus @xmath39 . in figures  [ fig : xpyp ] and  [ fig : xy ] , we compare current constraints with those projected using the method described in this paper . in figure  [ fig : xpyp ] , we show the results of the time - dependent analyses of @xmath120 from cleo  @xcite , babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite , and focus  @xcite .",
    "the regions for cleo , babar , and belle allow for @xmath15 violation in the decay amplitude , in the mixing amplitude , and in the interference between these two processes , while the focus result does not .",

    "we note that our sensitivity to @xmath38 depends strongly on the value of @xmath45 , while our sensitivity to @xmath39 does not , and lowering the value of @xmath127 would reduce the area of the contour . in general , our expected upper limits compare favorably with the current best limits on charm mixing .",

    "in contrast to previous measurements of mixing parameters  @xcite , our method is both time - independent and sensitive to @xmath38 and @xmath39 at first order , so it is subject to different systematic uncertainties . also , it is unique to threshold production where the @xmath1 initial state is known , unlike with @xmath4 mesons produced at fixed target experiments or through @xmath128 decays , as at the @xmath44-factories and at lep .",
