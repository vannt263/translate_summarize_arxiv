    "the principle of equivalence , although expressed explicitly in general relativity , is usually implicitly assumed in dynamical system theory .",
    "according to this principle free motion of a dynamical system occurs along the geodesics of the background space where motion takes place . in other words",
    "the geometry of the background space determines uniquely the kinematics of the dynamical system .",
    "this is why the geodesic equations of a space are so important in the study of the evolution of dynamical systems .",
    "the second factor which makes these equations important is that when a dynamical system is  moving \" under the action of a  force `` then the only change in the equations of ' ' motion \" is that the geodesic equations from homogeneous differential equations become inhomogeneous , the inhomogeneity factor being the force in the right hand side of the equations . in short the geodesic equations of a space",
    "are important to study the evolution of dynamical systems .",
    "the above considerations led to the study of lie symmetries of second order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . in a number of papers",
    "aminova , feroze06,tsamp11a it has been shown that the lie symmetries of the geodesic equations are elements of the projective algebra of the space . furthermore , because the geodesic equations follow from the geodesic lagrangian , people have studied the noether symmetries of this lagrangian and showed that the noether symmetries are elements of the homothetic algebra of the space @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of noether symmetries is important because it provides the noether currents which can be used for a double reduction of the equations of motion and , if there is a sufficient number of them , to the solution of the ode by means of quadratures .",
    "these studies have been generalized to lie and the noether symmetries of certain classes of partial differential equations ( pdes ) bozhkov , freire , tsampjgp1,tsampijgmp and it has been shown that their generators are from the conformal group of the background space .    the noether point symmetries are symmetries of the action integral .",
    "therefore in principle they concern all problems involving an action `` integral even if these problems do not concern the equations of motion .",
    "one such problem is the determination of the minimal surface area under constant volume in a given riemannian space . in this case",
    "the action '' integral involves the minimization of a surface and not of an arc length , as is the case with the equations of motion @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors have found a relation between the noether symmetries of the minimal lagrangian with the isometries of the underlying space for some specific spaces . the purpose of this work it to give a geometric proof of this result and generalize the problem in two directions : ( a ) in a general riemannian space ( having the appropriate topology in order closed surfaces with a finite volume to exist ) ; and ( b ) in a dynamical way , that goes beyond geometry , in general relativity and dynamical systems theory .",

    "we determine the noether point symmetries of the minimal surface action under constant volume and show that the generators of noether symmetries are elements of the killing algebra of the space . due to the two dimensionality of the variation we have conservation currents instead of simple first integrals together with two extra conditions . in section examples",
    "we apply our results to a general euclidian space , spaces of constant curvature and to schwarzschild spacetime .",
