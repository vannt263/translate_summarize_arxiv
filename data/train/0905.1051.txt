    "the derivation of fourier s law of heat transfer in insulating solid materials is a difficult problem which has been challenging theoretical physicists for close to two centuries @xcite .",
    "however , recent works @xcite on models of confined particles in interaction have shed new light on this problem , setting the stage for a systematic derivation of fourier s law from first principles .",
    "these works suggest that there is hope to achieve such a first principles characterization of heat transfer and prove the validity of fourier s law in a particular class of insulating materials known as aerogels .    in order to achieve such a characterization ,",
    "the authors of @xcite have focused their attention on classes of models which , like aerogels , combine the collisional dynamics of gases with the spatial structure of solids . starting from a hamiltonian description , it was shown that the heat conductivity of such models is universally given by the frequency of collisions between gas particles .",
    "this universality manifests itself when the gas particles are individually trapped in a porous solid material and only rarely collide with each other , mostly rattling around their traps . under this assumption ,",
    "individual particles typically achieve local equilibrium states at their respective kinetic energies , ergodically exploring their trapping cells , before energy exchanges proceed .",
    "this local equilibration mechanism is rather similar to the trapping mechanism of tracer particles in a periodic lorentz gas which lead machta and zwanzig @xcite to infer a stochastic approximation of mass transport in the lorentz gas . in this approximation ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is identified , up to dimensional factors , with the rate of jump of tracer particles from cell to cell .",
    "likewise , in our systems , this local equilibration naturally yields a stochastic description of the time evolution of the probability distribution of the local energies in terms of a master equation .",
    "such derivation was extensively studied in @xcite , relating to the dynamics of confined two - dimensional hard - disks .",
    "irrespective of the dimensionality of the underlying dynamics , the main difficulty when analyzing the transport properties of such stochastic systems is that , unlike with the machta - zwanzig models which deal with independent tracer dynamics , the energy distributions can not be reduced to single cell distributions . nevertheless , the transport coefficient in this case the heat conductivity is identified , up to dimensional factors , as the rate of energy exchanges .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of the results presented in @xcite to the dynamics of trapped three - dimensional hard spheres .",
    "starting from the liouville equation which describes the time evolution of phase - space distributions of such systems , we consider the reduction of this equation to a stochastic evolution for the local energies under the assumption that collisions between neighbouring particles are rare compared to wall collisions . we subsequently show that the stochastic kernel which characterizes the energy exchanges between neighbouring cells has the symmetries described in @xcite which ensure the identity between the heat conductivity and frequency of energy exchanges .",
    "furthermore , the expression of the stochastic kernel is much simpler in the case of three - dimensional hard spheres than in that of two - dimensional hard disks .",
    "the model is thus amenable to higher precision numerical simulations , which allows us to confirm the preceding arguments to a higher precision than had been previously obtained in the framework of underlying two - dimensional dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a summary of the results described in @xcite is presented in section [ sec.summary ] . in section [ sec.3dsys ]",
    "we introduce mechanical models of periodic networks of confined hard spheres and discuss the necessary assumptions upon which these systems are amenable to a stochastic reduction .",
    "the statistical evolution of these systems is considered in section [ sec.statevol ] and its reduction to a stochastic equation in section [ sec.meq ] , with a detailed derivation of the stochastic kernel .",
    "the identity between the energy exchange frequency and the thermal conductivity is established in section [ sec.kappa ] .",
    "numerical results supporting our theoretical arguments are presented in section [ sec.num ] .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are drawn in section [ sec.con ] .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0 energy cells @xmath1 , with stochastic exchange of energy among pairs of neighbouring cells .",
    "we assume that the statistical evolution is described by the following master equation , @xmath2\\ , ,    \\label{mastereq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the stochastic kernel specifying the process of exchange of energy @xmath4 between two neighbouring cells @xmath5 and @xmath6 at respective energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "we will be concerned here with kernels that do not depend on the specific pair @xmath10 of neighbouring cells .",
    "given the two energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the characteristic time scale of energy exchanges between neighbouring cells @xmath5 and @xmath6 is determined by the collision frequency @xmath11 whose canonical equilibrium average at temperature @xmath12 we denote @xmath13 .",
    "in the proper hydrodynamic scaling limit , this master equation yields the time evolution of the local temperatures , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimension of the underlying dynamics .",
    "this evolution turns out to be given according to fourier s law , namely @xmath16\\ , ,    \\label{fourierlaw}\\ ] ] where the heat conductivity @xmath17 is @xmath18 the result ( [ kappaeqnu ] ) establishes an identity between a macroscopic quantity , the heat conductivity , and a microscopic one , the frequency of energy exchanges between two neighbouring cells .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the derivation of this identity follows from equation ( [ mastereq ] ) in two independent ways , which rely on special symmetries of the kernel .",
    "these symmetries concern the equilibrium averages of the first and second moments of the energy exchanges , @xmath19 in @xcite , we showed that the kernel @xmath20 associated with the confining dynamics of two - dimensional hard disks has the symmetries : @xmath21    given the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) , there are two ways of computing the heat conductivity .",
    "the first one is to assume a non - equilibrium stationary state resulting from a temperature gradient .",
    "one then finds that the heat conductivity has expression @xmath22 which , using the properties of the kernel ( [ symkernel ] ) , in its turn yields ( [ kappaeqnu ] ) .    the second way of computing the heat conductivity is through the green - kubo formula , from which it turns out that only static correlations contribute to the transport coefficient with expression @xmath23 and , again using the symmetries of the kernel ( [ symkernel ] ) , we obtain ( [ kappaeqnu ] ) .    the goal of this paper is to provide a derivation of the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) associated with the stochastic energy exchanges of rarely interacting confined hard spheres and show that the corresponding kernel has the symmetries ( [ symkernel ] )",
    ". the identity ( [ kappaeqnu ] ) ensues .",
    "we show in this paper that these results extend verbatim to the kernel associated with the confining dynamics of three - dimensional hard spheres .",
    "consider a lattice of confining three - dimensional cells , each containing a single hard - sphere particle .",
    "the mechanism of confinement prevents mass transport .",
    "however we imagine a form of semi - porosity by which particles in neighbouring cells are able to perform elastic collisions with each other , thereby exchanging energy .",
    "such a mechanical system with hard - core confinement is depicted in figure [ fig.example ] .",
    "two dimensional versions of similar systems were extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "we note that the geometrical details of the confining cells are irrelevant for what follows so long as the local dynamics mixes the velocity angles .",
    "that is , each cell taken individually with a single moving particle inside them is a semi - dispersing billiard with uniform equilibrium measure on the constant kinetic energy surface .",
    "this assumption validates the local equilibrium distributions described in the next section .",
    "these systems combine the collisional dynamics of gases and the spatial structure of solids .",
    "there is therefore a natural distinction between the local dynamics , which deal with the interactions between the moving particles and the solid matrix of their confining cells , and the interacting dynamics , by which two moving particles in neighbouring cells perform an elastic collision . on the one hand ,",
    "the local dynamics are characterized by a wall - collision frequency , @xmath24 , which depends on the geometry of the confining cell as well as on the kinetic energy of the moving particles through well known results of ergodic theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interacting dynamics are characterized by the frequency of binary collisions , _",
    "i.e. _ the frequency of collisions between neighbouring particles , denoted @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the scale separation , @xmath26 , is achieved .",
    "this involves specific conditions which depend on the geometry of the confining cells , but which will not concern us here .",
    "this assumption is to say that individual particles typically perform many collisions with the solid matrix of their confining cells , rattling about their cages at higher frequency than that of binary collisions .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , in this regime , liouville s equation governing the time evolution of phase - space densities reduces to a master equation for the time evolution of local energies . the scale separation between the two collision frequencies @xmath25 and @xmath24 is the only parameter that controls the validity of this reduction .",
    "moreover it becomes exact in the limit of vanishing binary collision frequency .",
    "the phase - space probability density of the mechanical systems of @xmath0 confined hard spheres is specified by the distribution function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , denote the @xmath5th particle position and velocity vectors .",
    "the index @xmath5 stands for the label of the confining cells . for our system ,",
    "as is customary for hard sphere dynamics , this distribution satisfies a pseudo - liouville equation @xcite , which is well defined in spite of the singularity of the hard - core interactions .",
    "this equation , which describes the time evolution of @xmath31 is composed of three types of terms : ( i ) the advection terms , which account for the displacement of the moving particles within their respective billiard cells ; ( ii ) the wall collision terms , which account for the wall collision events , between the moving particles and the solid matrix of their confining cells ; and ( iii ) the binary collision terms , which account for binary collision events , between moving particles belonging to neighbouring cells  : @xmath32 p_n + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{a , b=1}^n b^{(a , b ) } p_n\\ , .",
    "\\label{pseudoliouville}\\ ] ] the first two terms account for the motion of individual particles within their respective cells , whether free advection or wall collisions , and the third term is the binary collision operator which , written in terms of the relative positions @xmath33 and velocities @xmath34 of particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the unit vector @xmath35 that connects them , is @xmath36\\ , . \\label{binarycollisions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      equilibrium states of equation ( [ pseudoliouville ] ) are product measures such as a maxwellian distribution with inverse temperature @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the volume accessible to all @xmath0 particles , or micro - canonical measures of totally energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 where the gamma function is @xmath42      under the assumption that particles typically collide more often with the solid matrix of their confining cells than among nearest neighbours , the time - evolution ( [ pseudoliouville ] ) is dominated by the local terms so that the distribution @xmath31 rapidly evolves toward a local equilibrium distribution , which depends upon the energy variables @xmath43 only .",

    "the corresponding stochastic kernel will in this case depend on the geometry of the pores involved in the energy exchange and , in particular , on the precise number of particles in those pores . the symmetry relations ( [ symkernel ] ) will thus reflect local properties of the system whose overall average yields the corresponding macroscopic properties . in this sense , one expects that fourier s law can be derived in a rather general setting for such systems of confined particles , and the value of the heat conductivity expressed in terms of the frequency of energy exchanges between the cells .",
