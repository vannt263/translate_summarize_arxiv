    "the semileptonic @xmath2 meson decays are important frameworks to restrict the standard model ( sm ) parameters as well as search for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "experimental progress at @xmath2 factories offers the possibilities to study such decay channels in near future ( see for instance @xcite ) . among the semileptonic @xmath2 decays ,",
    "the @xmath0 transition is important as it happens via loop flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) of @xmath3 transition at quark level .",
    "such loop transition can be used to explore the effects originating from new physics beyond the sm , hence , theoretical calculations of the related parameters to these transitions become important in this respect .",
    "universal extra dimension ( ued ) model is one of the popular extension of the sm .",
    "this model is a category of the extra dimension ( ed ) @xcite which allows the sm fields ( both gauge bosons and fermions ) to propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "comparison of the results obtained by ued with those of the sm can offer interesting phenomenology .",
    "we consider the simplest ued model where just a single universal extra dimension compactified on a circle of radius @xmath4 called the appelquist , cheng and dobrescu ( acd ) model @xcite to investigate the @xmath0 transition .",
    "the effective hamiltonian responsible for @xmath3 transition was calculated in the acd model in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles interact with themselves as well as with the sm particles .",
    "these interactions bring additional feynman diagrams compared with the sm and require changes in the wilson coefficients entering to the effective hamiltonian . in this model ,",
    "the wilson coefficients and as a result , the effective hamiltonian are described in terms of the compactification factor @xmath1 .",
    "the main ingredients in analysis of the considered transition both in ued and sm models are form factors entered to the transition matrix elements .",
    "these form factors have been recently calculated both in the perturbative qcd @xcite and light cone qcd sum rules @xcite approaches .",
    "using the corresponding form factors , we depict sensitivity of the related physical observables such as branching ratio , polarization distribution and forward - backward asymmetry to the compactification factor @xmath1 and compare the obtained results from extra dimension with those of the sm .",
    "the acd model has been previously applied to investigate the following channels : @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently , we have also investigated many observables describing the @xmath7 transition using the corresponding form factors obtained from full qcd in ued model @xcite .",
    "for some other applications of the acd model to hadron physics see @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath0 transition has also been investigated in the standard model and two new physics scenarios : vector - like quark model and family non - universal @xmath12 model @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in next section",
    ", we introduce the effective hamiltonian responsible for the considered transition . in section iii ,",
    "the transition matrix elements and fit functions of the responsible form factors are presented . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the sensitivity of the aforementioned physical quantities to the compactification factor @xmath1 and compare the obtained results with the sm predictions .",
    "last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0 transition proceeds via loop @xmath3 transition whose effective hamiltonian is written as : [ e8401 ] h^eff & = & g_f _ em v_tb v_ts^2  . where @xmath13 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath14 are elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , @xmath15 is the fine structure constant and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are wilson coefficients .",
    "the wilson coefficients in acd model are calculated in @xcite in leading logarithmic approximation . in this model ,",
    "each wilson coefficient is described in terms of some periodic functions @xmath19 having an ordinary sm part @xmath20 and an extra part in terms of the compactification factor @xmath1 , i.e. , f(x_t,1/r)=f_0(x_t)+_n=1^f_n(x_t , x_n ) . [ functions ] here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 is the top quark mass . in the above equation , @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the mass of the kk particles and @xmath25 corresponds to the ordinary sm particles .",
    "the glashow - illiopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism guaranties the finiteness of the functions @xmath26 and satisfies the condition @xmath27 when @xmath28 .",
    "explicit expressions for the wilson coefficients with all input parameters are presented in @xcite . from the expressions for the wilson coefficients , we see",
    "that , the @xmath16 and @xmath18 are only functions of the compactification factor . however , the @xmath17 , besides the @xmath1 , depends also on the transferred momentum squared @xmath29 . using the explicit expressions for these coefficients",
    ", we obtain the numerical values for @xmath30 , @xmath31 as well as @xmath32 at a fixed value of @xmath29 and different values of @xmath1 in table  [ scxy ] . in this table",
    ", we also present the values of these coefficients from the sm . here",
    ", we would like to make the following comment about the range of the compactification factor , @xmath1 . from the electroweak precision tests ,",
    "the lower limit for @xmath1 is obtained as @xmath33 if @xmath34 expressing larger kk contributions to the low energy fcnc processes , and @xmath35 if @xmath36 @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we consider the range of @xmath1 from @xmath37 up to @xmath38 . with a quick glance at table  [ scxy ]",
    ", we observe that the values of wilson coefficients in ued model differ considerably from their sm values .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 is enhanced and @xmath16 is suppressed .",
    ".numerical values for @xmath16 , @xmath18 and values of @xmath17 at @xmath39 for different @xmath1 s and the sm .",
    "[ scxy ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dependence of the forward - backward asymmetry on compactification factor for @xmath40 and two leptons are shown in figure 3 . from this figure and analysis of the forward - backward asymmetry , we conclude that    * there is a considerable discrepancy between the acd and sm bands also in this case at lower values of the compactification factor . * as it is expected @xmath41 for both leptons .",
    "* considering the central values of the form factors , we observe that @xmath42 in the case of @xmath43 is approximately seven times greater than that of the @xmath44 .",
    "we analyzed the rare @xmath40 transition both in acd and sm models .",
    "in particular , we presented the sensitivity of some physical observables like branching ratio , longitudinal polarization and forward - backward asymmetry to the compactification factor , @xmath1 .",
    "the order of the branching ratio of @xmath45 shows that this channel can be studied in the near future experiments .",
    "the obtained results show considerable discrepancies between the prediction of the two models on the considered physical quantities at lower values of the compactification parameter .",
    "this discrepancy exists and can not be killed even if the uncertainties of the form factors are taken into account .",
    "these results together with the other evidences for deviation of the acd model predictions from those of the sm obtained by investigation of many observables related to the @xmath2 and @xmath46 channels in @xcite , can be considered as a sign for the existence of kaluza - klein particles and extra dimensions in the nature which should we search for at the lhc .",
